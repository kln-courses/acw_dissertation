(Boston: Kluwer 1979) Philosophers have many reasons to be keenly interested in recent controversies about sociobiology, the study of the biological basis of social behavior. Besides the many methodological issues of interest to the philosophy of science, the claims of sociobiologists such as E.O. Wison raise questions of direct relevance to ethics and political philosophy, both theoretical and applied.1 Michael Ruse's book is the first systematic philosophical examination of sociobiology, and he brings to the topic his impressive knowledge of contemporary biology and the history and philosophy of science. The book is lively as well as lucid, and provides an excellent introduction for anyone interested in the field. Ruse's general strategy is to defend the possibility of sociobiology against its critics, while cautioning against overestimating the current evidence in favor of accepting sociobiology. Although Ruse has not succumbed to the uncritical enthusiasm that has overtaken many biologists and found its way into the popular press, I shall argue that he has underestimated the weight of many of the ob- jections which have been levied against human sociobiology, especially the political objections. I shall first discuss several methodological issues involving falsifiability, theory acceptance, and the use of analogy. Then I 1 See E.O.

My concern in this review is with human sociobiology. 751</page><page sequence="2">Paul Thagard shall examine Ruse's replies to the critics who have found sociobiology to be politically suspect. This examination leads to discussion of the political responsibilities of scientists, and of the social character of science. I shall not comment on Ruse's several introductory chapters which provide an accurate and comprehensive yet concise summary of the relevant biological doctrines. The most vociferous opponents of sociobiology have been the members of the Boston Sociobiology Study Group of the organization, Science for the People.2 This group includes the distinguished biologists Richard Lewontin, Richard Levins, and Stephen Gould. Of their methodological criticisms, the potentially most damning has been the claim that sociobiology is unfalsifiable, in that its structure leaves no room for the possibility of failure of confirmation.3 Stephen Gould says that sociobiology is largely an exercise in 'just so' storytelling, offering purely speculative explanations of social phenomena.4 For any phenomenon, from homosexuality to xenophobia, it seems that the sociobiologists can construct an account of how the behavior might aid in survival and reproduction and therefore be the result of genetically determined dispositions. Although homosexuality might seem to be a difficult case for genetic explanation, since homosexuals are presumably less likely to pass their genes on to offspring, sociobiologists such as Wilson conjecture that homosexuals have indirectly increased their overall Inclusive fitness' by helping to care for their siblings' children, to whom they are genetically similar. If evidence is found that historically it has not been the case that homosexuals have promoted their genes by helping to raise their relatives, another genetic connec- tion would be sought, leaving untouched the basic assumption that there must be a genetic basis for homosexuality. Hence sociobiology seems unfalsifiable. Ruse (1 11-9) shows that this criticism of sociobiology is fraught with problems. He points out that no simple Popperian account of falsifica- tion is adequate: even the most respectable scientific theories from Newtonian mechanics to modern evolutionary theory protect themselves from falsification by propounding auxiliary hypotheses 2 See the articles 'Against "Sociobiology"' and "Sociobiology - Another Biological Determinism/ reprinted in Caplan, op. cit. 3 R.C.

Ruse Sociobiology: Sense or Nonsense? which permit explanation of problematic cases. In respect to willingness to admit falsification or even failure of confirmation, sociobiologists therefore seem no worse than other scientists, especially scientists in a young and apparently expanding field. However, even though there is no ground for rejecting sociobiology out of hand as unfalsifiable, there is a related respect in which sociobiology is methodologically criticizable. Every science uses some auxiliary hypotheses in its explanations, but sociobiology is noteworthy for the astonishing abundance of such hypotheses. We saw in the pur- ported explanation of homosexuality the supposition that homosexuals have served a special supportive role in child care, but there is no evidence that this supposition is true. Another frequently introduced auxiliary hypothesis is Wilson's 'multiplier effect7 which is invoked to ex- plain how there could have been a genetic basis for the rapid cultural changes in human civilization in the past 5,000 years, when there has been very little genetic change in homo sapiens in at least 30,000 years. Wilson claims that a small genetic change can be amplified into a major social effect, but lacks independent evidence of how and whether this has happened. Similarly, sociobiologists cite a 'threshold effecf to ac- count for why the multiplier effect has not produced cultural developments in species other than our own. The use of these and many other auxiliary hypotheses does not in itself brand sociobiology as non-scientific, but it does show that the theory is seriously deficient on one of the criteria which, I have argued elsewhere, are central to judg- ing the acceptability of theories.5 Ruse does not comment on the profu- sion of auxiliary hypotheses in sociobiology. Much of the appeal of sociobiology derives from its promise of pro- viding a highly unified account of many diverse phenomena, from feeding strategies in ants to the incest taboo in humans to male ag- gressive behavior. No single opposing theory offers such systematic pro- mise. The alternative to a unitary sociobiological explanation of human social behavior is a medley of anthropological and sociological accounts of the cultural development of various practices. However, the ad hoc nature of the principles required by sociobiology in its wide range of ex- planations of human practices greatly vitiates its claim to systematiza- tion. Ruse (163) makes it clear that he is not urging the acceptance of sociobiology as true, only its continuation as an interesting research pro- gram. In Ch. 7 he provides a balanced assessment of the direct and in- 5 See the discussion of simplicity in Paul Thagard, The Best Explanation: Criteria for Theory Choice/ journal of Philosophy, 75 (1978) 76-92. 753</page><page sequence="4">Paul Thagard direct evidence for sociobiology, granting that it is often very thin. I want to comment on only one aspect of the evidence, since it seems to me to provide a great deal of the impetus of the sociobiological enter- prise. This is the analogy between animal behavior and human behavior. Ruse (145) is appropriately cautious about the strength of this analogy. The magnitude of the human cultural realm is a highly relevant dissimilarity between humans and other animals. Ruse concludes 'that in theory one can argue analogically from the primates to humans; but in practice I am far from convinced that the sociobiologists have yet pro- vided enough evidence to do so, at least in any definitive way7 (145). Ruse seems to assume that the problem is simply a matter of comparing the relevant similarities and differences of animal and human behavior. However, he fails to notice that descriptions of animal behavior are highly theory-laden, laden with assumptions and concepts derived from descriptions of human societies.6 For example, we describe ant societies in terms of 'castes/ 'workers/ 'slaves/ 'soldiers/ and 'queens'; and we speak of the 'altruism' of an ant which dies defending its colony. Such descriptions incorporate metaphors from human society which serious- ly imperil any attempt to reason analogically back to human societies: apparent parallels may derive from the anthropomorphic conceptual scheme which was used to describe the animal society. The problem here is not simply verbal: it is not just that sociobiologists choose possibly equivocal words such as 'slave' and 'worker' and 'competition.' Underlying the use of these terms is a con- ceptual scheme with presuppositions which may be dubious for human as well as animal societies. Political presuppositions which present humans as essentially individualist and competitive will attach special meaning to certain sorts of behavior: our view of human nature may af- fect whether we describe two disorderly dogs as fighting or playing. Thus sociobiological analogies are very problematic because of the con- ceptual dependency of the animal domain on the human domain. I am not saying that there are no similarities between animal and human behavior, only pointing out that analogical arguments based on the ap- parent similarities are more inductively tenuous than ordinary analogical arguments. Many people are attracted to sociobiology because of these apparent analogies between human and animal behavior. Ruse on the other hand seems to be most attracted to sociobiology through methodological 6 Cf. Richard M.

Ruse Sociobiology: Sense or Nonsense? analogies between it and other disciplines which comprise evolutionary theory. He sees population genetics as providing the unifying link and underlying basis for paleontology, morphology, embryology, and so on, and he would like to see sociobiology added to the list (18, 19). The political critics of sociobiology focus on a very different set of analogies, between sociobiology and other doctrines of biological determinism which have proven to be politically reactionary. The list of such doc- trines includes: Spencerian social Darwinism, with its defense of nine- teenth century laissez-faire capitalism; the eugenics movement, which flourished in the first part of this century and led to the U.S. Immigration Act of 1924, severely limiting immigration from Eastern and Southern Europe; Nazi race ideology; the view of Arthur Jensen and others that racial differences in IQ is largely genetically determined, from which many have concluded that egalitarian social programs must necessarily fail; and finally the popular belief that women possess biological limita- tions which necessitate their subordinate social status. Ruse largely neglects these historical analogues of sociobiology. All share with sociobiology the assumption that some politically significant human characteristics have a genetic basis. This in itself is enough to make sociobiology politically suspect, even without explicitly reactionary remarks by sociobiologists. Ruse sets out to defend sociobiology against charges that it is racist, sexist, and a species of capitalistic ideology (Ch. 5). At one level he is very successful. He points out that explicitly racist and capitalistic remarks are very rare in the writings of sociobiologists, and argues that in any case we should not blame the theory of sociobiology for the in- discretions of sociobiologists. He states (86) that sociobiology is essen- tially a theory of the effects of genes on behavior and in itself has no nor- mative consequences about racism and capitalism. He would probably reply to my statement of the analogy between the politically reactionary doctrines listed above and sociobiology, by saying that it is not sociobiology which shares the objectionable features of the doctrines listed, but only the potential non-scientific use or misuse of sociobiology. However, these statements betray an oversimple view of both philosophy of science and political philosophy. The two central pro- blems concern the nature of scientific theories and the politics of their acceptance. In his earlier introduction to the philosophy of biology, Ruse advocates the logical empricist view that theories are essentially axiomatic systems, employed hypothetico-deductively.7 Sociobiology 7 Michael Ruse, The Philosophy of Biology (London: Hutchinson 1973). 755</page><page sequence="6">Paul Thagard then can be viewed essentially as a set of sentences used to make predictions. How could a set of sentences about genes be politically ob- jectionable? I cannot here review the array of objections that have been levied against the logical empiricist account.8 But there is much evidence that an alternative account of the nature of scientific theories is needed, an account which will much more adequately represent the actal use of theories by scientists. T.S. Kuhn's notoriously ambiguous no- tion of a paradigm is an attempt to develop an alternative notion of theory.9 Despite its analytical flaws, the notion has the great merit of suggesting how a scientific theory functions more like part of a world view than like a deductive device. World views do not operate in isola- tion, in narrowly empirical domains. Sociobiology construed as a world view can easily be seen to make direct contact with political doctrines of the past which have been used to support racism, sexism and capitalism. To say that sociobiology is tied in with such doctrines is not to say that it implies them, but that it can very naturally be used for the same ends as the overtly political doctrines. Public reaction makes it clear that sociobiology has already been us- ed for such ends. Business Week published in 1978 an article entitled 'A Genetic Defense of the Free Market/ and in the same year Playboy published 'Darwin and the Double Standard/ advertising: 'Do men neeof to cheat on their women? A new science says yes/ The National Front in Britain has recently cited sociobiology as providing evidence for its ob- viously racist views.10 Defenders of sociobiology will undoubtedly claim that these examples constitute misuses of sociobiological theory, and that sociobiologists can not be held responsible for misunderstandings and vulgarizations of their scientific doctrines: to question their views on political grounds would be to impede the free process of scientific in- quiry. Scientific inquiry is indeed aided by relative immunity from social in- terference as to what theories are accepted as true. We have a wealth of evidence, from Galileo to Lysenko to the McCarthy era, of the dangers of subjecting science to ideological control. No more than Ruse would I urge that current work in sociobiology be suppressed. But sociobiologists ought to be aware that they are developing as yet weak and ill- 8 See F.

Ruse Sociobiology: Sense or Nonsense? supported theories in a social context in which anything which suggests support for sexism and racism is likely to be eagerly taken up. Could it be the scientific merit of sociobiology which has led People, Time, and Omni magazines to run interviews with Wilson, rather than with recent Nobel prizewinners in physics? Sociobiologists have social responsibili- ty to stress the very provisional character of their hypotheses and also to combat the reprehensible political applications of their ideas. Science is not just a set of propositions. Ruse's effort to distinguish sociobiology from what the sociobiologists say shows that he shares the common view that science is essentially a body of knowledge, perhaps together with a set of methods for progressively improving knowledge. Such neglect of the social dimensions of science virtually requires the positing of a Platonic/Popperian 'third world' of ideas ripped from any psychological or social context.11 But in an age of national research councils, multi-million dollar research projects, and complex scientific communities, this picture of science is as dated as the pre-Victorian im- age of the gentleman scientist. Sciense is a social enterprise, both in its internal organization and in its relation to other parts of society, in- cluding universities, industry, and the state. Hence sociobiology must be viewed as a discipline embodied in a socially situated community of practitioners, not as an abstract set of propositions. Investigation is needed of how such disciplines interrelate with society at large. In par- ticular, we need to know much more about the relation of the doctrines propounded by a discipline to the prevailing world view of the society in which it works. In the social sciences, where the complexity of phenomena makes promising theories and significant data equally scarce, choice of theories is very likely to be made on largely ideological grounds. Richard Rudner argued that the acceptance of scientific theories essentially involves value judgements, since 'How sure must we be before we accept a hypothesis depends on how serious a mistake would be/12 A mistake in accepting sociobiology would be serious indeed, if it led to diminished efforts to reform society to reduce inequality. Even if sociobiology is true, caution is in order, since sociobiological doctrines might be used hastily in support of social decisions which greater deliberation would show to be undesirable.

Frank, ed., The Validation of Scientific Theories (New York: Collier 1961) 33. 757</page><page sequence="8">Paul Thagard tended to help, the fact is that such arguments are often made, and in our society often accepted as conclusive. The philosopher of science cannot discuss fields such as sociobiology withot reckoning their social consequences. This is true even if one rejects Rudner's claim that social consequences are relevant to the level of confidence at which one ac- cepts a theory, for social consequences are clearly relevant to the ques- tions of whether and how one promulgates a theory. At least in deciding how to disseminate their theories, scientists have a responsibility to judge the social consequences of their actions. It would be naive to claim, as some philosophers have done with respect to the IQ controversy, that sociobiology is purely descriptive and hence not of normative ethical signficance. First, even non- naturalists usually accept the principle that ought implies can, so that a biologically deterministic demonstration of the impossibility of ac- complishment of some egalitarian social program would refute the claim that we ought to undertake that program. Second, from a naturalist, consequentialist point of view, the biological properties of human beings are highly relevant. It could conceivably turn out that at- tempts to establish equality between members of certain groups and the rest of society would result in an enormous decrease in total welfare, because of the genetic limitations of those groups. The facts of the mat- ter would be relevant, if not themselves entirely conclusive. Hence the descriptive claims of sociobiology could have ethical significance That is not to say that they have the ethical significance which E.O. Wilson attaches to them. Ruse (Ch. 9) very effectively criticizes Wilson's crude revival of evolutionary ethics, which supposes that the course of evolution is inherently good. As Ruse points out, the problem with evolutionary ethics is not that it commits the naturalistic fallacy of deriv- ing ought from is, since the general fallaciousness of that move is disputable. Rather, evolutionary ethics errs in not seeing that there are principles of ethics more basic than the promotion of evolution of the human species. I have discussed the political issues in order to show that Ruse's book deals inadequately with what might be called the political philosophy of science. Such treatment is not surprising, since Anglo-American philosophy of science has rarely addressed questions concerning the political side of science.13 These questions include the following: 1 3 A comprehensive survey of recent work in the philosophy of science only men- tions the political philosophy of science in the chapter, 'Continental Philosophy of Science/ by Gary Gutting, which discusses Habermas.

(2) When should scientific inquiry be restricted on political or ethical grounds? (3) How and when does science function as ideology? (4) How are scientific ideas affected by social circumstances? To raise these questions is not to deny that science is a process of gain- ing knowledge about the world; it is only to recognize that the achieve- ment of knowledge through scientific inquiry is affected by social en- vironments. I have argued that Ruse has failed to appreciate the full force of many objections to sociobiology, especially the political ones. Nevertheless, his finely written book is essential reading for anyone interested in the sociobiology debate.14 December 1980 PAUL THAGARD, University of Michigan-Dearborn 14 I am grateful to Daniel Hausman and Douglas Boucher for helpful comments. 759</page></plain_text>
