Meira Neto Departamento de Biologia Vegetal, Universidade Federal de Vi?osa, 36570-000, Vi?osa, Minas G?rais, Brazil Abstract: We studied the foliicolous mycobiota associated with Coussapoa fioccosa. This is a tree belonging to the Cecropiaceae, endemic to the Brazilian tropical seasonal semideciduous montane forest. It is listed as an endangered species because of habitat destruction. Until now no fungus has been recorded in association with this plant species. This paper describes six foliicolous fungi associated with this plant that were collected during a survey of the mycobiota occurring in a locality where a small population of C. fioccosa was discovered. All fungi described here are new to science, namely Dennisiella coussapoae, Mycosphaerella coussapoae, Pseudoallosoma nervisequens (which also represents a newly proposed genus), Pseudocercospora coussapoae, Pseudocercospora atro/uliginosa and Tripospermum acrobaticum. The high proportion of taxonomic novelties revealed in this study reflects the general lack of mycological information for forest ecosystems in Brazil and also indicates that vulnerable plant species such as C. fioccosa may harbor unique mycobiota. Such myco biota may depend on their nearly extinct hosts and consequently can be equally endangered with extinc tion and therefore also deserve consideration for in situ and ex situ conservation.

E-mail: rbarreto@ufV.br (http://www.sosmatatlantica.org.br/). This wide spread ecosystem loss is due to deforestation and conversion to agriculture, pasture, forestry or urban ization, thus numerous taxa that are endemic to this ecosystem have become extinct or are now threatened by extinction (http://www.iucnredlist.org/). Con cerns about species loss in Brazil have focused on animals, particularly vertebrates, and plants, but the so-called lesser organisms, such as the fungi, largely have been ignored. This is inappropriate, particularly considering the growing recognition of the signifi cance of fungi in biodiversity worldwide. Fungi are also one of the most diverse groups of organisms, probably second only to arthropods (Hawksworth 1991, Fr?hlich and Hyde 1999, Hawksworth 2001) and is of key importance in ecosystem processes (Dighton 2003). Nevertheless the situation in Brazil is similar to that in most parts of the world, particularly in the tropics where mycodiversity is immense and mycological knowledge is limited. Many tropical countries and states have no mycologists in residence. Documentation of fungal taxa is urgent in a world of growing human population. An initiative toward surveying and describing the mycodiversity in the state of Minas G?rais was started by a group of mycologists and botanists, based at the Universidade Federal de Vi?osa, who organized a hands-on mycology workshop in Dec 2003 (Oficina de Micologia I: fungos da floresta estacional semidec?dua montana). This involved a brief but intensive survey of fungi associated with wild native plants in a fragment of Brazilian Atlantic forest, classified as tropical seasonal semideciduous montane forest in a relatively well preserved fragment that once covered a significant proportion of Minas G?rais. This 35 hectare fragment is part of a privately owned area that is locally known as Mata do Seu Nico. Some of the results of this survey have been published, for example Soares and Barreto (2005), Soares et al. (2006), Fernandes et al. (2007) and Rocha et al. (2008). During this survey the endangered status of an endemic tree species, Coussapoa fioccosa Akker mans &amp; C.C. Berg (Cecropiaceae), was highlighted by botanists in the team, stimulating interest about the fungi that C. fioccosa might harbor. Mendon?a and Lins (2000) listed 537 plant species in Minas G?rais as threatened with extinction, and 87 of these species occur in the remnant of the Atlantic forest. Among these is C. fioccosa, a large endemic 1240</page><page sequence="2">Rocha et al.: Mycobiota of Coussapoa floccosa 1241 tree that was considered vulnerable by those authors. It also is included in The IUCN's Red List of Threatened Species (http://www.iucnredlist.org/) as vulnerable because of habitat destruction. The serendipitous finding of few adult individuals at Mata do Seu Nico by botanists based at the Universidade Federal de Vi?osa in the early 2000s led subsequently to the choice of C. floccosa as the symbol of the 55th Congresso Brasileiro de Bot?nica (2004), held in Vi?osa. The known population of C. floccosa at this location was six adult individuals and no seedlings or saplings. In addition to these records from Vi?osa are four separate records (from 1985, 1989, 1993 and 2002) of a likely single C. floccosa tree from a preserved forest area in Minas G?rais, Mata do Jo?, Esta?ao Biol?gica de Caratinga, municipality of Caratinga (19?50'S, 41?50'W), but a recent visit to that site aimed at collecting fungi from this specimen revealed a likely loss of this isolate individual. Four individuals also are known from the municipality of Carangola, Minas G?rais, which also were traced (20?31'S, 42?08'W; 20?44'S, 42?03'W; 20?44'S, 42?27'W; 20?46'S, 42?12'W) and samples collected. One isolate also was traced and sampled from an old record from a stretch of forest on the campus of the Universidade Federal de Vi?osa (20?46'S, 42?51'W). Completing the search for all known individuals, a specimen record from a protected area in the municipality of Santa Maria de Jetib?, in state of Espirito Santo, (20?02'S, 40?41'W) was found at VIC in Jan 2010 by our team. It is possible that more intensive searches may yield additional specimens of C. fioccose, but it seems that this species is in fact rare and more vulnerable than ranked in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This publication includes a list of fungi found during a survey of species forming visible colonies on leaf surfaces or associated to lesions on leaves of C. floccosa. Fungi associated with other plant organs as well as endophytes, lichens and mycorhiza were not included in the present study. The fungi that were collected are described and discussed below. The publication of this work coincides with the UN's decision to name 2010 the International Year of Biodiversity (http://www.un.org/), having as its slogan "Biodiversity is life, biodiversity is our life". This study represents the first step toward a broader study on microfungi as endangered species and their conservation in Brazil. materials and methods All Coussapoa floccosa individuals within the collecting site are adults and up to 18 m tall. Samples were collected from C. floccosa with the double-rope technique (Counts et al. 2000). Freshly collected C. floccosa leaves colonized by fungi were examined under a stereomicroscope. Leaves bearing fungal structures were selected for further study. Leaf sections were cut by hand or fungal material was scraped from colonized tissues and mounted in lactophenol (20 g phenol, 20 mL lactic acid, 40 mL glycerin and 40 mL water). Observations were made and measurements and line drawing were prepared with an Olympus BX 51 light microscope fitted with a drawing tube. For scanning electron microscopy (SEM) leaves were cut into 1 cm2 pieces and fixed by immersion 1 h in 5% glutaraldehyde with a 0.1 M pH 7.2 sodium-cacodilate buffer. The specimens were dehydrated in a 30, 50, 70, 80, 95 and 100% ethanol series and washed three times in 100% ethanol. Samples were dried to the critical point with C02 in a Bal-Tec 030 and mounted on stubs and coated with 20 nm gold palladium with a Balzers SCD 010. The specimens were observed with a Zeiss LEO 1430VP scanning electronic microscope. Representative specimens of all species described herein were dried in a plant press and deposited at the Universidade Federal de Vi?osa herbarium (VIC). taxonomy Dennisiella coussapoae F.B.

Vitalia is a member of Coccodiniaceae that can be confused with Dennisiella but is easily distinguished from the latter by having setae on its ascomata, whereas only some of the species of Dennisiella have setae but when present are located around the ascomata (Batista and Ciferri 1962). Nine species of Dennisiella are now recognized. Dennisiella coussapoae resembles Dennisiella babingto nii (Berk.) Bat. 8c Cif. (Batista and Ciferri 1962) but differs by having ascospores 1-3-septate (instead of 3 6-septate in D. babingtonii). In addition D. babingtonii has thicker setae (6.0-8.0 ), wider asci (13. - 7.0 ) and wider ascoma walls (30.0-50.0 thick). Dennisiella cauc?sica (Woron.) Bat. 8c Cif. (Batista and Ciferri 1962), which morphologically is the closest to the new species, can be distinguished from D. coussapoae by having thicker hyphae (6.0 8.0 ), wider asci (60.0-75.0 ) and larger ascospores (30.0-75.0 x 7.0-8.0 ). Dennisiella setosa (Woron.) Bat. 8c Cif. (Batista and Ciferri 1962) differs from D. coussapoae by having aseptate erect setae, broader ascomata (220.0-230.0 ), larger asci (60.0-70.0 x 15.0-18.0 ) and larger ascospores (18.0-22.0 x 6.0-7.0 ). Dennisiella theae (Sawada) Bat. 8c Cif. (Batista and Ciferri 1962) has smaller ascomata (67.0-135.0 ) and larger asco spores (17.0-23.0 x 6.0-7.0 ). The absence of</page><page sequence="4">Rocha et al.: Mycobiota of Coussapoa floccosa 1243 setae on mycelia or the presence of setae around ascoma are important characteristics that distinguish the remaining species of Dennisiella from those listed above and also from the new species D. coussapoae.

On living leaves of Coussapoa floccosa, 24 May 2006, F.B. Rocha (HOLOTYPE: VIC 30454). Commentary. Only one species of Mycosphaerella has been recorded on a member of the Cecropiaceae, Mycosphaerella cecropiae Bat., J.L. Bezerra 8c Matta (Batista et al. 1961). However this has been recognized recently as belonging to Davidiella (Aptroot 2006), and it has ascospores 4.0-5.0 wide (as compared to those of M. coussapoae, which are 2.5-4.0 wide). The fungus on C. floccosa also was compared with species of Mycosphaerella that have been recorded on hosts of the closely related family Urticaceae from Brazil. Mycosphaerella coussapoae is clearly distinct from each of the following species: Mycosphaerella sublibera Petr. (Petrak 1950), which has wider ascospores (4.0 5.5 diam) and paraphysoids in its pseudothecia; Mycosphaerella superflua (Auersw.) Petr. (Petrak 1940), which has larger ascomata (90.0-180.0 ), curved ascospores and paraphysoids in its pseudothecia; Mycosphaerella urticae-dioicae Tomilin (Fakirova and Denchev 2004), which has asci organized in a fascicle of numerous asci and wider ascospores (4.0-5.0 ) that are slightly constricted at the septa; Mycosphaerella rubella (Niessl) Magnus (Saccardo 1882), which has pseudothecia that are densely aggregated, parallel asci, 46.0-60.0 long and ascospores 12.0-16.0 X 4.0 5.0 that are constricted at the septa; Mycosphaerelfa pouzolziae Sawada (Sawada 1944), which has asci 11.0? 14.0 diam and ascospores 13.0-14.0 X 4.0-5.0 . The recognition of M. coussapoae as a separate novel species hence is justified. The teleomorph/anamorph connection was not established with any of the two species of Pseudocercospora described herein, but the possibility of such a connection exists. Nevertheless this fungus always was found associated with lesions that were clearly distinct from those caused by the two Pseudocercospora species, which were of different size, shape and color. Until evidence to the contrary is obtained we prefer to treat these as three separate taxa. Pseudoallosoma F.B. Rocha, J. L. Bezerra 8c R.W. Barreto, gen. nov. Fig. 3 MycoBank MB514077 Etymology.

Commentary. Pseudoallosoma has several features (asci borne in uniascal loculi within a pseudoparen chymatous hamathecium, usually at different levels) that suggests its placement in Myriangiaceae. Never theless a closer examination revealed that it also has a similar morphology to that of two members of the Saccardiaceae (Allosoma Syd. and Dictyonella H?hn.). This family indeed was regarded by von Arx and M?ller (1975) as closely related to Myriangiaceae. The fungus on Coussapoa nevertheless clearly does not fit the current generic concept of the two genera. Members of Allossoma do not have setae and have ascospores that are permanently two-celled and brown. Dictyonella has ascoma developing above the superfi cial mycelium and do not have setae (see von Arx and M?ller 1975). The recognition of Pseudoallosoma</page><page sequence="7">1246 Mycologia (Myriangiaceae) as being closely related to Allosoma (Saccardiaceae), justifying the etymology, supports the suspected proximity of these two families as suggested by von Arx and M?ller (1975).

Commentary. Three species of Pseudocercospora are described on members of the Cecropiaceae and seven described on Urticaceae. Pseudocercospora coussapoae was compared with each of these species, but its morphology is different. Pseudocercospora cecropiae (F.

Commentary. Pseudocercospora atro/uliginosa is an unusual cercosporoid hyphomycete resembling cer tain species of genus Sirosporium, S. mori (Syd. 8c P. Syd.) M.B. Ellis in particular (Ellis 1963). However Sirosporium is a genus that is regarded as being of uncertain position. Phylogenetic data based on the type species or any other species of this genus are lacking (Crous and Braun 2003). The type species and other genuine species of this genus are characterized by having thickened and darkened condiiogenous loci (scars), comparable with those of Passalora (Braun 1995). Because the fungus on C. fioccosa does not have</page><page sequence="10">Rocha et al.: Mycobiota of Coussapoa floccosa 1249 thickened hila it cannot be assigned to Sirosponum but, in accordance with the current wide concept of Pseudocercospora (Crous and Braun 2003), it should be placed in this genus. Although conidia with constric tions and oblique septa are known in Sirosporium these may be present in Pseudocercospora and even Pseudo cercospora vitis (L?v.) Speg., the type species of Pseudocercospora, bears them. Pseudocercospora atroful iginosa is distinct from P. coussapoae, the other species of this genus on C. floccosa, by forming superficial hyphae with solitary conidiophores, much longer, pluriseptate conidiophores and longer, wider, plur iseptate conidia.

Commentary. T?pospermum acrobaticum was found intermixed with D. coussapoae. This led initially to the suspicion that T. acrobaticum might be the anamorph of D. coussapoae. However species in Tnpospermum have Tnchomerium as teleomorphs (Kirk et al. 2008) whereas the anamorph of Dennisiella belongs to Microxiphium. Moreover mycelium of T. acrobaticum and D. coussapoae can be distinguished easily even when intermixed by being verruculose in D. coussapoae and smooth in T. acrobaticum. Perhaps the coinci dence of their repeated simultaneous occurrence in the same areas of the foliage is due to equivalent environmental requirements or represents a symbiotic association of unknown nature. Twenty-six species have been described in genus Tripospermum. Descriptions of all these species were compared to the fungus on C. floccosa (Table I). Tnpospermum acrobaticum resembles some species more than others. Tnpospermum acerinum P. Syd. (Saccardo et al. 1931) is similar to T. acrobaticum but has stalked cells that are two-celled and conidial arms hyaline toward the apex. Another species that resemble T. acrobaticum is Tnpospermum fructigenum (Rabenh. ex Sacc. 8c Trotter) S. Hughes (Ciferri et al. 1956), but this species has mycelium that is constrict ed at the septae and the hyphae are 5-7 wide, conidial arms are 8.0-13.5 diam and it produces recognizable conidiophores. In addition Tnposper mum myrti (Lind) S. Hughes (Matsushima 1975), also resembles T. acrobaticum, but has conidial arms that are up to 35 long, hyphae that are 3.5 wide and smooth to verruculose and it also produces phialides. discussion The discovery of six new fungal taxa, including one representing the type species for a new genus, from investigations of C. floccosa foliage samples highlights the potential of mycodiversity studies. It also strength ens the argument for preservation of endangered plant species such as C. floccosa. The potential loss of such a rare tree species, as suggested by the preliminary results from this work, is accompanied by a loss of a unique and possibly specialized mycobiota. The uniqueness of this mycobiota is clearly demonstrated by the taxonomic novelties that were yielded by this study. Evidence indicates the absence of these fungi on other plant species related to C. floccosa, which also were examined in the more intensively surveyed area (few C. floccosa individuals were colonized by the fungi described in this work and all fungi but M. coussapoae and P. atrofuliginosa were collected only from a single tree at Mata do Seu Nico). Ongoing host specificity studies (results to be published separately) indicate that these fungi are strictly dependent on C. floccosa, confirming their status as both new and highly endangered fungal species. The diversity of the mycobiota of C. floccosa is probably much greater than the six species reported here. Only a limited number of the foliar fungi observed in this study are described in this paper. No attempt was made to investigate the endophytes growing within the leaves at this stage of the work. Moreover no attention was given to fungi associated externally or internally to other organs of this plant species.

The discovery of a cryptic fungal community associated with a plant is certainly not a novelty and not an attribute that is exclusive to C. fioccosa, but the recognition that such a tree species represents in fact a complex community containing other unique organ isms that may exist in complete dependence of this rare species may serve as an alert about the urgency of preserving it and the need of an unbiased attitude toward species preservation. This study, although preliminary, also indicates that the six new fungal taxa described above may deserve consideration (after further evidence of host specificity is obtained) for a pioneering inclusion of microfungi in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as well as their inclusion in Minas G?rais' and Brazil's lists of endangered species. It is acknowledged here that sequence data, which are unavailable for the newly proposed species due to practical limitations, would provide useful informa tion for this work. Nevertheless the clear morphologic distinction of each of the newly proposed taxa was regarded as sufficient to justify their proposal. These may be strengthened later by the use of molecular information and phylogenetic analysis. acknowledgments This work is part of a research project submitted as a master's dissertation to the Departamento de Fitopatologia/Universi dade Federal de Vi?osa by F.B.
