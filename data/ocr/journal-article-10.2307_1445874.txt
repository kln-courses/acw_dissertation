PALMER The effects of salinity on fertilization success and larval mortality of four populations of Fundulus heteroclitus were determined. These populations were representative of different salinity regimes, i.e., coastal vs Chesapeake Bay pop- ulations, and different subspecies, F. h. heteroclitus and F. h. macrolepidotus. Fertilization did not occur in freshwater for any of the populations nor did fertilization occur in 5 parts per thousand for the two populations representative of F. h. heteroclitus (Tuckerton, New Jersey and York River, Virginia) and only achieved 11-27% successful fertilization in the F. h. macrolepidotus populations (Woods Hole, Massachusetts and Sassafras River, Maryland) at the latter salinity. Differences in fertilization among populations could be due to genetically based subspecific differences, the fishes' acclimation salinity, or a combination of both factors. Larval mortality, independent of salinity during embryonic incubation, varied between the two coastal populations. The Tuckerton population exhibited higher larval mortality in freshwater than the Woods Hole population. The reduced ability to tolerate low salinity may prevent the heteroclitus populations from inhabiting low salinity environments and thus help to explain their absence in low salinity portions of Delaware and Chesapeake bays. For all populations, abrupt reductions in salinity during the reproductive season may have a signif- icant but previously unrecognized, negative impact. SALINITY is an important physical factor controlling distribution of teleosts in general (Campeau et al., 1984; Holliday, 1969, 1971), and species in the genus Fundulus in par- ticular (Rao, 1974; Fritz and Garside, 1974). The mummichog, Fundulus heteroclitus, is nor- mally found in estuarine or salt marsh environ- ments (Hildebrand and Schroeder, 1928; Big- elow and Schroeder, 1953), but it has also been reported in completely freshwater habitats (Garside, 1969; Denoncourt et al., 1978; Sa- maritan and Schmidt, 1982). Under laboratory conditions, adults and lar- vae can survive salinities as high as 120 and 112 ppt, respectively (Griffith, 1974; Joseph and Saksena, 1966). However, salinity has been shown to differentially affect the fertilization success of two populations of F. heteroclitus. One population exhibited 90-100% fertilization at 30 parts per thousand (ppt), whereas the other had almost no fertilization at 30 ppt (Bush and Weis, 1983). Pronounced clinal variation in different char- acter sets exists among populations of F. heter- oclitus along the east coast of North America and within the Chesapeake and Delaware bays (Able and Felley, 1986). Differences in egg morphology led Morin and Able (1983) to re- vise our knowledge of the distribution patterns of Jordan and Evermann's (1898) F. heteroclitus subspecies. Thus, along the coast, F. h. macro- lepidotus is distributed from Connecticut north- ward, while F. h. heteroclitus is found from south- ern New Jersey southward, with intergrade populations occurring in northern New Jersey and on Long Island. Disjunct populations of F. h. macrolepidotus are located in the upper, low salinity, portions of the bays, while F. h. heter- oclitus populations inhabit the lower portions, and intergrade populations are found in be- tween (Morin and Able, 1983; Able and Felley, 1986). We tested the null hypothesis that salinity tol- erance was not a contributing factor in the suc- cess of early life stages, and specifically exam- ined the effect of a range of salinities on fertilization and larval mortality for both sub- species. Coastal populations with similar salinity regimes, and two Chesapeake Bay populations from different ambient salinities were tested.

Sexually mature in- dividuals were returned to the laboratory and kept in 37.9 liter aquaria. Fishes were placed on a 16:8 light: dark cycle and acclimated for 3 wk prior to testing at a salinity of 20 ppt. Sassafras River individuals were maintained in 5 ppt, the salinity in which they were collected. The salt water was prepared by adding artificial sea salts (Rila Marine Mix) to dechlorinated tap or well water. Temperature was held at 22 ? 1.5 C. Fish were fed twice daily with a com- mercial dry fish food. Fertilization experiments.-For each experiment eggs from an individual female were stripped into a dry petri dish and randomly divided into four subsamples. Subsamples averaged 27 eggs and none had fewer than 10 eggs. The eggs from each subsample were artificially insemi- nated in freshwater, 5, 15, and 30 ppt using the wet method of Galinka (1961). Milt from one consubspecific male was stripped into 10 ml of each test salinity. The ova sperm solutions were then simultaneously added to 25 ml of the ap- propriate test salinity. The procedure was per- formed in less than 2 min for each female, and was done for 10 females/population, except for Sassafras River in which five females were used (total number of eggs for all populations = 4102). Milt from one male was used to inseminate the ova from each female, i.e., 10 males/10 fe- males. Eggs were examined 3 h after insemi- nation (the two cell stage, Armstrong and Child, 1965), with the onset of cleavage used as a cri- terion for successful fertilization. Eggs were reexamined 24 h later to confirm fertilization. All nonfertilized eggs were counted and dis- carded, and the percent fertilized determined. To assess the effects of salinity on sperm mo- tility, the milt from five males per population was examined in freshwater, 15, and 30 ppt salinity treatments. Motility was qualitively ex- amined in each salinity using the procedures of May (1975). Larval mortality.-Larvae from nine females from both Tuckerton, New Jersey and Woods Hole, Massachusetts were used for the larval mortality experiments. In each instance eggs from a single female were fertilized in 15 ppt, and after 3 h randomly placed in 100 ml petri dishes of either freshwater or 15 ppt (average number of embryos per dish: Tuckerton 127.6 and Woods Hole 72.4). Embryos were incubat- ed through hatching in either freshwater or 15 ppt. Water was changed daily, and the dishes were agitated for 30 min a day on a shaker table. Upon hatching, larvae (total = 1752) were randomly placed in 4 liter, polyethylene con- tainers of either freshwater or 15 ppt, at a den- sity of 20 larvae or less. The water was aerated daily for 5 min and changed every other day. Larvae were fed Artemia salinia nauplii ad libi- tum. After 2 wk, the percent larval mortality per female was determined for each salinity. The role of the embryonic incubation salinity on larval mortality was determined by compar- ing mortality at each salinity for a given female whose embryos were incubated in either fresh- water or 15 ppt. If there were no differences between incubation salinities, the data were combined and a total mortality rate in fresh- water and 15 ppt was determined for each pop- ulation. The data were analyzed using the General Linear Model of the Statistical Analysis System (SAS). The fertilization study was analyzed us- ing a split-plot design of the arcsine square-root transformation of the percent fertilized eggs (Sokal and Rohlf, 1981).

Location, salinity and their interaction were main effects. The female within location error term was the lo- cation error term. In addition, four one-way analyses of variance were performed at each salinity level and a Duncan's Multiple Range Test was used to test for differences among lo- cations. Bonferroni control levels (Weisberg, 1985) were used for the one-way ANOVAs. RESULTS Fertilization success.-Salinity had a marked ef- fect on fertilization success but the effect varied between populations. Fertilization did not oc- cur in freshwater for any of the populations (Fig. 1). All ova became opaque upon exposure to freshwater, and none of the eggs exhibited I 20- 0 E ? 15- ' _ (9-382) a I U. c 10- (9-364) 5- (9-49) - WH TU WH TU FW 15 ppt Test salinity and population Fig. 2.

Also, fer- tilization was unsuccessful in 5 ppt for the Tuck- erton and York River populations (F. h. hetero- clitus). The Sassafras River population had significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher success (27%) in 5 ppt than all other populations. The fertiliza- tion success in 5 ppt for the Woods Hole pop- ulation was 11%, and although the population differences were not statistically different than the Tuckerton and York River populations, three Woods Hole females had success rates greater than 20%. The highest fertilization suc- cess for all populations was observed in 15 ppt. For all populations, sperm motility varied in response to salinity in the same manner. Sperm remained motile for 8 min in 15 ppt, 6 min in 30 ppt, and only 2 min in freshwater. Larval mortality.-There were no statistically significant differences in larval mortality be- tween embryonic incubation salinities. How- ever, there were significant (P &lt; 0.05) differ- ences in larval mortality between populations. Tuckerton larvae had significantly higher mor- tality in freshwater than Woods Hole larvae, 20% compared to 3%, and Woods Hole larvae had significantly greater mortality in 15 ppt than Tuckerton larvae, 12% as opposed to 6% (Fig. 2). 347</page><page sequence="4">COPEIA, 1988, NO. 2 DISCUSSION Fertilization success.-All populations exhibited reduced fertilization success in fresh and low (5 ppt) salinity waters (Fig. 1). It is not uncommon for estuarine and marine fishes to experience diminished fertilization in freshwater (Galinka, 1970; May, 1975). Galinka (1970) reported no fertilization in freshwater for the White Sea herring, Clupea harengus pallasi, and as was re- ported in our other experiments (Palmer and Able, 1987), the ova became opaque following exposure to freshwater. In a laboratory exper- iment similar to the one performed here, the fertilization success in freshwater of an estua- rine form, F. parvipinnis, was only 9% (Rao, 1974). Although sperm were significantly less motile in freshwater, the duration of motility was comparable to most freshwater fishes (Gins- burg, 1968). Because sperm penetration and in- corporation is a rapid process in Fundulus (Brummett and Dumont, 1981) it is likely that sperm were active enough to fertilize eggs. Thus, the reduced fertilization in freshwater is prob- ably due to an osmotic shock experienced by the ova as was proposed for the White Sea her- ring (Galinka, 1970). Three of the four F. het- eroclitus test populations were maintained at 20 ppt, and had ovarian osmolarities of 360 mosm (Palmer, 1985). During fertilization, their eggs probably experienced osmotic shock when mov- ing from the ovary (360 mosm) to freshwater (&lt;5.0 mosm). There may be a genetic basis for enhanced fertilization in lower salinities, with populations of the subspecies macrolepidotus being slightly more tolerant to low salinities. There were con- sistent differences in fertilization success at 5 ppt among the subspecies. Of the four popu- lations, only Woods Hole and Sassafras River (subspecies macrolepidotus) females exhibited any fertilization in 5 ppt (Fig. 1). Two of the four populations, Woods Hole (subspecies macrolep- idotus) and Tuckerton (subspecies heteroclitus), were collected from habitats with similar salin- ity ranges (Table 1) and were both maintained in 20 ppt. Although not statistically different, the mean success in 5 ppt was 11% for Woods Hole individuals as opposed to 0% for Tuck- erton individuals. Alternatively, it also appears that acclimation effects may alter fertilization success. This is a possible explanation for the greater success at 5 ppt of the Sassafras River population which was maintained in its ambient salinity of 5 ppt, rather than 20 ppt as for the other populations. Subsequent experiments have shown that the acclimation salinity of the adult is important to the viability of eggs and sperm (Palmer and Able, 1987). Larval mortality.-The environment that a de- veloping embryo experiences often is important in establishing the environmental tolerances of the larvae andjuveniles. Embryonic acclimation has been shown to be important in determining larval tolerances to anthropomorphic (i.e., pol- lutants) and abiotic (e.g., temperature and sa- linity) factors. However, for F. heteroclitus the embryonic incubation salinity had no effect on the salinity tolerance of either Tuckerton or Woods Hole larvae. Larval mortality in fresh- water was similar for embryos incubated in 15 ppt and freshwater, and larval mortality in 15 ppt was also similar for both embryonic incu- bation salinities. Larval mortality in freshwater was greater for Tuckerton larvae, while at 15 ppt mortality was higher for Woods Hole larvae. The differences were observable irrespective of embryonic in- cubation salinity suggesting a genetic basis for differences in larval salinity tolerances between the two subspecies (i.e., F. h. macrolepidotus pop- ulations may be better adapted to low salinity environments). In general, the data on fertilization success and larval survival suggest that populations of F. h. macrolepidotus had greater success in low salinity waters than F. h. heteroclitus populations. These data suggest a genetic as well as environ- mental component to salinity tolerance in these early life history stages. Genetic differences could explain in part why populations of F. h. macrolepidotus are capable of maintaining them- selves in the upper Chesapeake Bay. There are other data which suggest that the southern form is less tolerant of low salinity waters. Joseph and Saksena (1966) reported that larvae from a York River population (subspecies heteroclitus) toler- ated salinities between freshwater and 112 ppt. However, 100% mortality occurred within 11 d after the larvae were transferred to fresh- water from 14.5 ppt. Also, the only reported occurrences of natural freshwater populations of F. heteroclitus are in the northern portion of its distribution, and presumably represent F. h. macrolepidotus populations. Freshwater popula- tions have been reported from the Bronx River, New York (Samaritan and Schmidt, 1982); sev- eral ponds in New Hampshire (Scarola, 1973); various locations in Nova Scotia (Klawe, 1957; 348</page><page sequence="5">ABLE AND PALMER-SALINITY EFFECTS ON FUNDULUS Garside, 1969); and on Prince Edward Island (Hubbs et al., 1943). Freshwater populations have also been reported in the upper Delaware River (Hastings and Good, 1977), the Susque- hanna River, which empties into upper Chesa- peake Bay (Denoncourt et al., 1978), the upper reaches of the James and Potomac Rivers (pers. obs.; R. Morin, pers. comm.) All these popula- tions possess morphological characteristics ofF. h. macrolepidotus (Morin and Able, 1983; pers. obs.). The rather abrupt changes in salinity expe- rienced in the above experiments may closely approximate actual conditions in east coast es- tuaries. Fundulus heteroclitus, regardless of sub- species, spawns in the late spring and into the summer (Newman, 1907; Brummett, 1966; Taylor et al., 1979; pers. obs.), which is also the period of highest annual rainfall. Spring fresh- ets can cause significant diurnal and monthly changes in salinity in estuaries along the east coast, e.g., Massachusetts (Hoffand Ibara, 1977), Virginia (Haas, 1977), North Carolina (Wein- stein et al., 1980), Georgia (Rogers et al., 1984) and Florida (Livingston, 1976). Rogers et al. (1984) reported a maximum diurnal range of 20 ppt in a Georgia salt marsh, and Hoff and Ibara (1977) reported similar monthly variation in a Massachusetts estuary. Thus, abrupt de- creases in salinity, due to spring freshets, could be a significant source of mortality during the early life history through decreases in the fer- tilization success, and increases in larval mor- tality, in local populations of F. heteroclitus.
