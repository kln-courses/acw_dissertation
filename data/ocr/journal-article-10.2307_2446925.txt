<plain_text><page sequence="1">GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE BEETLES.* -In this ex- ceedingly interesting and suggestive essay, the author divides the Coleoptera of the world into three great "stirps," or assembla- ges:-the Indo-African, the Brazilian, aud what for want of a better name he calls the "microtypal" stirps; the species com- posing it "being of a smaller size, or, more strictly speaking, not containing such large or conspicuous insects as the others." Thus all but the tropical, even including the Australian insects, are considered as belonging to this mass of small forms. "The coleopterous fauna of our own land [Great Britain] may be taken as its type and standard." We very much question whether this division be not too arti- ficial to be generally received by zoologists. The primary distri- bution of faunae corresponding to the polar, temperate and tropical regions, would seem to be the more philosophical, being based on climatic causes. Mr. Murray believes that the diffusion of animals and plants by accidental means "bears no important part in the establishment of any definite fauna or flora." He thinks that actual continuity of soil and subsequent isolation alone produce fauna with a defi- nite character. While he thinks these changes of surface took place before the Tertiary period, and does not believe that the new Atlantis, to take a case in point, existed during that period, yet he is one of the most ultra in the school of writers on geo- graphical distribution who take up and put down continents like checkermen. Thus the Azores, Canary Islands and St. Helena, Ascension Island, St. Paul and Tristan d'Acunha, are to Mr. Mur- ray the relics of a former continent, when the Atlantic was dry land, and Europe and America ocean beds. He puts down a *On the Geographical Relations of the Chief Coleopterous Fauna. By Andrew Murray. Extracted from the Linnaean Society's Journal.--Zoology, vol.

This is a species of anthropomorphism in science that we are disposed to distrust, as facts of distribution of life in palveozoic times, as Mr. Murray acknowledges, tend to show that the Silurian continental nucleus of Europe was not indebted to that of North America for its fauna, or vice versa; and in all prob- ability there has been no interchange of forms between the Arctic and Antarctic lands. Do not the known facts in geographical distribution tend to show that the different continental nuclei have been from the first, distinct centres of distribution and evolution for the larger proportion of animals and plants, which may have evolved from ancestral forms, at the outset restricted to separate ocean beds. and separate continents?</page></plain_text>
