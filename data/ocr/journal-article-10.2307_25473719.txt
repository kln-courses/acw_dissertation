<plain_text><page sequence="1">asi The Tree Wedding in "Cyclops" and the Ramifications of Cata-logic Brigitte L. Sandquist University of California at Irvine If each episode of Ulysses poses its own narrative problems, then the question of "Cyclops" might be stated thus: what are we to do with the diverse and massive catalogues, lists, and interpola tions that interrupt the first person narrative that recounts the dia logue in Kiernan's pub, and what is their function? The narrative seems unable to incorporate the catalogues, just as the Cyclops in Homer's Odyssey vomits "gobs of human meat," the undigested re mains of some of Odysseus's companions.1 Many critics view the obsessive listing and cataloguing of the episode as simply another demonstration of Joyce's stylistic gymnastics, another example of giddy encyclopedism. The catalogues are seen as either rhetorical inflation or as blocks in the narrative economy, easily detachable units, non-narrative logjams in the progress of the "real story." In deed, it seems almost a function of the catalogues themselves (which contain so much untheorized residue) that they go untheorized in the criticism.2 Reducing Joyce's catalogues to so much deadwood is a move with specific implications and a certain implied narrative theory. In fact, it represents a privileging of narrative or story line, and it assumes that the catalogues have little or no rhetorical function or perfor mance in the text. The latter position is especially difficult to main tain when we arrive at episodes like "Ithaca" or sections of Pinnegans Wake that are constituted solely by lists. Confronted with the strange topography of catalogues and narrative, readers (especially readers crjming from a nineteenth-century realist novel tradition and even readers coming from the more narrative-intensive early episodes of Ulysses) feel like aliens or intruders. Our question becomes?how do we negotiate this unfamiliar and intimidating textual landscape? Like Odysseus in the strange land of the Cyclopes, we need to be wily and crafty in our approach, applying Odysseus's epithet poly metis (many-minded) to our critical practice. Taking as my starting point the "Cyclops" episode and the Tree Wedding catalogue in par 195</page><page sequence="2">ticular and proceeding with the assumption that catalogues do more than stand as inert blocks of words in the progression of the narra tive, I will look at three suggestive intertexts for the Tree Wedding in "Cyclops." The tree catalogue has a long history as a literary topos and is therefore a productive site for examining Joyce's intertextual choices, but I will also try to show that the catalogues in general have a dynamic and performative function in "Cyclops." Their threat to narrative continuity ultimately has ramifications for any story about "Joyce's politics" that critics, citing this episode as evi dence, hope to tell.3 The Tree Wedding: A Metamorphosis of Ovid's Metamorphoses In his essay "Ovidian Roots of Gigantism in Joyce's Ulysses/' Fritz Senn suggests in a footnote that the tree catalogue in book 10 of The Metamorphoses might be an intertext for the Tree Wedding in Joyce's "Cyclops."4 In this book, Orpheus seats himself on a stretch of open ground, and, as he begins to play his lyre, trees move close to shade him: The oak tree of Chaonia and poplars, Phaethon's sisters, crowded round, along with Jupiter's great oak, with its lofty branches, and soft lime trees and beeches, and the virgin laurel, brittle hazels, and ash trees, that are used for spear shafts, smooth firs and the holm oak, bowed down with acorns, the genial sycamore, and the variegated maple, willows that grow by the rivers and the water-loving lotus, evergreen box, slender tamarisks, myrtles double-hued, and vibur num with its dark blue berries.5 (227) Indeed, in Joyce's Tree Wedding, Miss Gladys Beech, Mrs. Holly Ha zeleyes, Mrs. Poll Ash, Miss Fir Conifer, Mrs. Norma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis, Miss Blanche Maple, and Miss Myra Myrtle corre spond to some of the trees in Ovid's catalogue. However, Senn ad mits that "it is possible?but not stringent that some of the many trees that Ovid works into this episode contribute to Joyce's Tree Wedding Insertion" ("Roots" 567).6 In fact, the history of the tree-list topos has rings like a gigantic redwood, including, among others, Virgil, Ovid, Giovanni Boccaccio, Geoffrey Chaucer, Edmund Spenser, and John Keats. What is important to note about this possi ble source for Joyce's Tree Wedding is that tree catalogues are not simply lush arboreal flourishes, detailed descriptions planted in a text as the verbal equivalent of a fertile natural landscape. The tree catalogue actually has narrative roots. In Ovid, every tree has a story to tell, and part of the topographical function of trees is to 196</page><page sequence="3">plant the landscape with mininarratives. A grove of trees signals a site where narrative has blossomed before, and therefore it is ulti mately a source of inspiration to a poet. In this case, Orpheus as a poet is surrounded, not just by shade trees but by story-telling po tentiality as well. Perhaps a more closely related Ovidian intertext to Joyce's Tree Wedding appears in book 2, where Phaethon's sisters, grieving at his tomb, metamorphose into trees. Ovid's tree catalogue in book 10 alludes to this earlier scene with the phrase "poplars, Phaethon's sisters, crowded round." The story is worth examining closely so that we can see what transformations Joyce grafted onto his list. After Phaethon's demise, caused by driving his father's chariot too close to the sun, his sisters lament and mourn by his tomb daily for months. One of the sisters, Phaethusa, "as she tried to fling herself upon the ground, complained that she could not move her feet* (59). Another sister is also held "fast by roots which had suddenly formed" (59). Soon all of the sisters have become trees, and Ovid's description captures the violence and physicality of the trans formation: A third made to tear her hair, and plucked out leaves. One cried out that her legs were caught in the grip of a tree trunk, another was indignant to find her arms had become long branches. While they were marvelling at this, bark surrounded their thighs, and gradually spread over womb and breast, shoulders and hands, till only their lips remained, vainly calling for their mother. (59) Until the transformation is complete, the girls retain some human characteristics. When their mother breaks off branches, trying to tear their bodies out of the tree trunks, the girls cry out, *'Oh mother, please, don't hurt me... It's my body you are injuring, though it has been transformed into a tree'" (59). Ovid writes that the bark finally closes over their last words. Ovid's violent and graphic depiction of women metamorphosing into trees is itself transformed as an intertext by Joyce in "Cyclops."7 It is noteworthy that, earlier in "Cyclops," several pages before the Tree Wedding, Joyce presents a scene where women coexist natu rally and harmoniously with trees: In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thor oughly well supplied. Lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play 197</page><page sequence="4">with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels [and other living creatures]. (U 12.74-81) By the time we get to the Tree Wedding later in the episode (U 12.1266-95), the metamorphosis is complete. Maidens and trees are no longer metonymically juxtaposed; they have merged together. Even the pretentious language ("firstclass foliage," "exalted plan etree," the "well supplied" world) is transformed into the formal discourse of the society page. The differences between the Ovidian text and Joyce's text are tell ing. In Ovid, specific women become generalized into an undifferen tiated class of trees; in Joyce's catalogue, this process is inverted? trees become personified as women. In Joyce's catalogue, common nouns for trees become proper names. A "class" of natural objects (trees) becomes a social class, more particularly a class that desig nates a highly specific social landscape. The "fir" becomes "Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley," and a similar thing happens with such trees as the elm, birch, ash, and olive. The transformation in Ovid's text is toward the natural and organic; in Joyce's text, the natural and or ganic enter a system of language and discourse. In fact, Joyce's cata logue goes even further than changing trees into women; more spe cifically, the trees become names. We can see how this process is given another turn of the screw in the Anna Livia PlurabeUe chapter of Finnegans Wake, where the tree woman transformation of "Cyclops" is reversed. Instead of trees turning into women, as they do in the Tree Wedding, a woman (one of the washerwomen) turns into a tree. But the inversion or reversal in Finnegans Wake does not just return to the Ovidian model. Again, there is reversal with a difference. The "washerwoman" (or perhaps a more accurate reading would be the "washerwoman voice") feels her feet taking root, and the language in the following sentence re calls Ovid's line in which the bark closes over the sisters' last words: "My foos wont moos. I feel as old as yonder elm" (FW 215.34-35). In the last lines of the chapter, she becomes an "elm" from the phrase "tell me": "Tell me, tell me, tell me, elm! Night night! Telmetale of stem or stone" (FW 216.03-04). Joyce moves us from the realm of nature into the realm of language when he turns trees into the names of women in "Cyclops"; in ALP, the stakes are raised again. The "washerwoman" turns into an elm, but her transformation is a dis cursive one only, a transformation in language and a transformation because of language. To return to my comparison of Ovid's book 2 and Joyce's Tree 198</page><page sequence="5">Wedding, in Ovid, we see the metamorphosis in process with all of its graphic detail. Joyce's text effectively tears up the trees by their roots and transforms them into women, but we see no violence or frustration in this catalogue (it seems to be a light-hearted, humor ous play with names and genre), since this metamorphosis has al ready been completed by the time we read the Tree Wedding. In Ovid's story, the women-trees are presented in a matriarchal space; it is their mother who comes to their aid in the forest, and she franti cally rushes this way and that in an attempt to save her daughters. The tree-women in "Cyclops" are presented in a highly-structured social space, rather than a natural one, and this space is patriarchal. Every tree is marked with "Miss" or "Mrs.," designating an elabo rate root system of kinship. The kinship/tribal system is also marked by theiact that the bride is given away by her father, the M'Conifer of the Glands (U 12.1279-80). What Joyce seems to be do ing in his metamorphosis of Ovid is highlighting the structures and implications of names, genealogical trees, and kinship systems. The violence in Ovid's text concerning women turning into trees against their will translates into a certain violence inherent in the ven* act of naming in the Tree Wedding. In fact, the violence that the Tree Wed ding represses from its Ovidian analogue returns with a vengeance throughout the episode. Kinship names may seem natural, neutral, and objective, but Joyce's catalogue, when it is read along with Chid, shows us the violence under what appears to be a natural symbolic order. Certain names have power, social prestige, and influence. To put it another way, genealogical trees are not innocent or disin terested,8 and the Text has prepared us for this conclusion even be fore we reach the Tree Wedding. During the execution scene (U 12.592-678), the fianc?e of the condemned man, grieving at the thought of his impending execution (we recall the maidens grieving for Phaethon), is approached by "a handsome young Oxford gradu ate," who presents This visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree" (Li 12.658-59,660) and asks her to marry him. Later we are told parenthetically that the "gallant young Oxonian" is "(the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion's his tory)" (Li 12.665-66). Within the tangled roots of this comic and playful social registry (or perhaps I should write "social registree"), which seems to be one of the least political of all of the interpolations in an extremely politi cal episode, lies an implied discourse of genealogy, origins, legiti macy, naming, power, and violence. It can be no accident that Joyce shows that "genealogical trees" and "timehonoured names" are pos sessions of those in power, the English. Furthermore, although this 199</page><page sequence="6">may seem to be the most innocuous catalogue in the episode, a society-page wedding of tree-women, when we remember that the letters of the Irish alphabet are names of trees,9 the catalogue takes on weightier political and rhetorical significance. A Beam in the Eye/I of the Narrative My analysis in the preceding section focused on the intra catalogue dynamics of the Tree Wedding, particularly as it can be highlighted in relation to the Ovidian intertext. What remains to be studied is how the catalogue operates structurally and thematically in the episode as a whole. This section will explore the structural issues by looking at the Homeric intertext for "Cyclops," while the following section will explore some of the thematic issues. The parallels to the plot of the Homeric "Cyclops" (Odysseus throwing a "fire-point-hardened timber" (9.387) into the Cyclops's eye) are easily recognized in Joyce's version: the chimney sweep in the first paragraph who "near drove his gear" (U 12.03) into the eye of the narrator, Bloom's still-burning cigar (U 12.1469), the hundreds of references to eyes and blindness, and Bloom's remark that "[s]ome people... can see the mote in others' eyes but they can't see the beam in their own" (U 12.1237-38). Even beyond these surface details, the basic plot of Homer's "Cyclops" episode (Odysseus in truding into the land of the Cyclops, Odysseus blinding the Cyclops with a wooden beam) is narrativized into the very structure of Joyce's "Cyclops" episode and is played out in the tension between narrative (a linear, diachronic structure) and catalogue (non narrative information in a vertical, synchronie structure). Just as Odysseus is an alien in the foreign land of the Cyclopes, the catalogue can be seen as alien to the textual land of the episode "Cyclops."10 The interpolations and catalogues in "Cyclops" disturb, jar, block, and check any sense we may have of a continuous, cohe sive, unified narrative thread. They remind us that we expect narra tive continuity and a single, homogeneous voice. In "Cyclops" the interruptions are especially noticeable since the catalogues and in terpolations (which are collective, anonymous, and very much writ ten texts) specifically uproot a first-person narrative, which consists largely of a recounted oral dialogue between the narrator, the Citi zen, and the other figures in Kiernan's pub.11 From the first word of the episode?"I"?we are also introduced to the "eye" or perspective of the text. The narrator of "Cyclops" remains an unnamed "I" for the entire episode. Many readers com ino</page><page sequence="7">pare him to "Noman" or "Nobody," the name with which Odysseus tricks the Cyclops; others see him (and the Citizen) as one-eyed Cy clopes. In my reading of the narrative structure, I see the "I" as the "eye" of the episode "Cyclops." In the Tree Wedding, the catalogue (the intruder or alien) assumes the guise of a guest or guest list, just as Odysseus, the alien, intrudes into the land of the Cyclopes, presenting himself as a guest And just as Odysseus throws a log in the eye of the Cyclops, the catalogues (tall, vertical beams) puncture both the eye and the ? of the narrative. A close reading of the Tree Wedding bears this out. It appears be tween two balanced sentences with "eyes" in them. Without the tree catalogue, the narrative would proceed as follows: ?Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan. [tree catalogue] ?And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen. (U 12.1265,1296) We see here the performative function of this tree catalogue; the tree catalogue literally hits the narrative right between the eyes. We could say that it is the structural or rhetorical equivalent of Bloom's statement "[s]ome people . . . can see the mote in others' eyes but they can't see the beam in their own." The chiasmus of the two sen tences (Europe/eyes, eyes/Europe) further focuses our attention (makes us look cross-eyed?) on the catalogue's position in the narra tive. (Perhaps it is for this reason that the Tree Wedding has been one of the more popular catalogues discussed in the criticism.) I suggested in the previous section that there is an implicit vio lence in this catalogue, a violence masked by Joyce's parodie use of the society column. My reading of the placement of this catalogue in the structure of "Cyclops" uncovers yet another kind of violence that has implications for the inscribed narrative theory of this episode. The Tree Wedding catalogue (and by extension, other catalogues and interpolations) punctures not only the "eyes" in the dialogue, but it also punctures or fractures the first-person narrator's I." To put it another way, the catalogue splits both the vision and the subjec tivity of the narrative. It shatters whatever illusion we may have of a single, unified narrative perspective, reminding us that a coherent, seamless, unified narrative is constructed, not natural. The multi perspectival mode of seeing that this move implies is the visual anal ogue of Joyce's heteroglossia and heterogeneity of discourses. By splitting the subjectivity of the "I," "Cyclops" also reminds us of the fallacy of a homogeneous, unified self.12 The ramifications of this split are important for the episode (and for all of Joyce's work) 201</page><page sequence="8">and for the questions that it poses about nationality, nationalism, and so on. For when we rethink the self, we must also reexamine what we mean by "nation." Bloom aptly embodies the idea that the different "selves" of a single "I" have different narratives and differ ent histories. Furthermore, the collapse of a unified subjectivity and a single narrative voice in this episode has implications for the writ ing of history. Catalogues have been a component of the "natural history" tradition since Pliny (whose Natural History, by the way, devotes several books to a listing of trees13). What Joyce's tree cata logue shows us from several different perspectives is that the pro duction and writing of history are anything but natural. Deforestation: A Historical/Contextual Intertext The Tree Wedding is not randomly placed somewhere in the mid dle of "Cyclops" (the previous analysis of its frame proves this); it appears in the midst of a highly-charged discussion about Ireland's forests and the economic and political stakes of their loss. In a long passage before the Tree Wedding, the Citizen decries the loss of Ire land's resources and productive capabilities. He mentions the immi gration problem and the decline of Ireland's textile production. Con juring up a nostalgic vision of Ireland's glory days in the world of trade, he asks: Where are the Greek merchants that came through the pillars of Her cules, the Gibraltar now grabbed by the foe of mankind, with gold and Tyrian purple to sell in Wexford at the fair of Carmen? Read Tac itus and Ptolemy, even Giraldus Cambrensis. Wine, peltries, Con nemara marble, silver from Tipperary, second to none, our farfamed horses even today, the Irish hobbies, with king Philip of Spain offering to pay customs duties for the right to fish in our waters. What do the yellowjohns of Anglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths? And the beds of the Barrow and Shannon they won't deepen with millions of acres of marsh and bog to make us all die of con sumption? (U 12.1248-57) I will return to this speech in a moment to compare it with one of Joyce's essays. Before doing so, however, I want to examine the rhe torical build-up to the Tree Wedding insertion. John Wyse Nolan replies to the Citizen: "?As treeless as Portugal we'll be soon ... if something is not done to reafforest the land. Larches, firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast" (U 12.1258-60). To which the Citizen enthusiastically intones: "?Save them . . . the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and 202</page><page sequence="9">an acre of foliage. Save the trees of Ireland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of Eire, O" (U 12.1262-64). The Tree Wedding takes on a much different aspect when seen in the light of the history of Ireland's forests and the call for land re form at the turn of the century. By 1904, forestland, once a rich natu ral resource, was only a little more than one percent of the land of Ireland. The forests were gradually stripped by the English and left to become bogs and swamps.14 In this context, we can see how the Tree Wedding catalogue functions as a massive effort of verbal "reaf forestation," rhetorically fulfilling the Citizen's verbal plea to "save the forests." Yet, both the Tree Catalogue and the Citizen's words are just words. TheNtree-women are names?not real trees?and Joyce seems to be drawing our attention to the ultimate unproductiveness of "save Ireland" rhetoric. We can extend my earlier paradigm about the catalogue being a beam in the eye/I of the text and make it a parable for Ireland's problem: rhetoric, pub talk, speech-making is a beam in the I of Ireland. Joyce seems to be saying that the belief that talk about a problem is the same as action is as ridiculous as the idea that Ireland can be reforested with a list of trees. In a well-knowTi passage in "The Resistance to Theory," Paul de Man, employing a different vegetable image ("no one in his right mind will try to grow grapes by the luminosity of the word 'day'"), succinctly describes this conflation of textual/linguistic reality with phenomenal reality as the problem of ideology: "It would be unfortunate, for example, to confuse the materiality of the signifier with the materiality of what it signifies."15 Joyce's essay "Home Rule Comes of Age" is an interesting inter text for this discussion. Many of the topics of the "Cyclops" episode are prefigured here. In the following sentence, which in many ways echoes the words of the Citizen, Joyce articulates England's debt to Ireland for damaging Ireland's land and forests: Nor will [the English] recall the fact that the statesmen and scientists who inspected the vast,central swamp of Ireland asserted that the two spectres that sit at every Irish fireplace, tuberculosis and insanity, deny all that the English claim; and that the moral debt of the English government to Ireland for not having reforested this pestiferous swamp during an entire century amounts to 500 million francs. (CW 195) It is important to realize that Joyce's argument in "Home Rule Comes of Age" is balanced and two-sided in a way that the Citizen's speech is not. Joyce goes beyond the single-minded rhetoric of the Citizen's speech as he attempts to explain the logic behind the problem: 203</page><page sequence="10">[England's] position is logical; it does not want a rival island to arise near Great Britain, or Irish factories to create competition for those in England, or tobacco and wine again to be exported from Ireland, or the great ports along the Irish coast to become enemy naval bases under a native government or a foreign protectorate. (CW 195) In addition, Joyce's essay, unlike the Citizen's speech, roots some of the blame with the Irish. He states that the Irish parliamentary party has gone "bankrupt," and he clearly means this in more than just the monetary sense of the term: "For twenty-seven years it has talked and agitated. In that time it has collected 35 million francs from its sup porters, and the fruit of its agitation is that Irish taxes have gone up 88 million francs and the Irish population has decreased a million" (CW 196, my emphasis). In this passage, Joyce shows the damaging effects of all talk and no action. He also notes that the "representa tives themselves have improved their own lot," and from the sen tence that follows we might understand the motivations behind Joyce's choice of the genre of the society page for the Tree Wedding passage: "From the sons of ordinary citizens, pedlars, and lawyers without clients [representatives of the Irish parliamentary party] have become well-paid syndics, directors of factories and commer cial houses, newspaper owners, and large landholders" (CW 196, my emphasis). Joyce's point in "Home Rule Comes of Age" is that the barriers to Home Rule are as much a function of Ireland's attitudes and actions (or nonactions) as they are a function of England's policies. And the Tree Wedding in "Cyclops" stages this problem in an interesting way: the rich "newspaper owners" in the "Home Rule" essay are transformed in "Cyclops" into a society page describing an upper class social event where the father "gives away" his daughter. The triviality of the social event underscores and heightens the serious ness of the problems of reforestation, depopulation, and Home Rule. In the passage that follows the Tree Wedding in "Cyclops," Joyce again shows the lack of logic in much of Ireland's pub talk. The Citizen, invoking the "help of the holy mother of God," declares that Ireland will again have a first-rate naval "fleet of masts" (U 12.1300, 1303-04). Yet his talk is only so much rhetorical sawdust. What the Tree Wedding has already established is that the Irish have only been able to reforest their land with lists of trees, not real trees. Building a fleet of masts requires wood, so in this scenario, verbal ships are the only kind of ships that Ireland will be able to produce. 204</page><page sequence="11">List! List! O list! While I do not want to suggest that we are out of the woods with the problem of the catalogue, my three intertextual readings have attempted to suggest paradigms for theorizing about the rhetorical function and performativity of Joyce's catalogues as interrelated components of the episode's structure. Although my discussion has had a microscopic focus (dealing with a single catalogue in a vast episode and an even vaster text), the issues that I have raised have ramifications not just for reading "Cyclops" but also for thinking about the kinds of criticism that this episode has generated. The dichotomy in "Cyclops" between catalogue and narrative, it seems to me, is repeated in the criticism: critics tend to read monologically, focusing on either the catalogues and interpolations or the narrative, but rarely accounting for tensions between the two. Interestingly, the criticism that is produced follows the corresponding rhetorical pat tern: readers of the lists tend to create more lists, and readers of the narrative tend to create more narratives. Let me elaborate these two tendencies. One of the challenges that this episode poses is how to read or listen to the catalogues without merely reproducing another list16 Indeed, the logic and structure of the catalogue, which seem to prompt persistent parataxis and endless enumeration, continue in the criticism in dizzying, cyclic proportions, threatening to ex haust if not paralyze the critic who attempts to reference and cross reference every item in a given list. The phrase "variously cata logued, regularly regrouped" (FW 129.12) from Finnegans Wake aptly describes this mode of criticism. The Tree Wedding alone receives three pages of recataloguing in Don Gifford and Robert J. Seidman's "Ulysses" Annotated (353-55). "Cyclops" is second only to 'Circe" in the number of pages devoted to an episode by Gifford and Seidman in their annotations. Even Andr? Topia's interesting theoretical dis cussion of intertextuality in "Cyclops," "The matrix and the echo: Intertextuality in Ulysses," cannot resist producing a list of the types of discourse at play in the episode.17 We could call this imperative, which seems to be generated internally by the text, "[t]he must over listingness" (FW 355.05-06). These words from Finnegans Wake, where the problem of the list is amplified exponentially beyond its treatment in Ulysses, may be a compact formula for the mode of criticism under discussion, but the problem of the list in Finnegans Wake and the problems it poses for interpretation deserve extended treatment. The attempt to totalize Joyce's text by recataloguing the various 205</page><page sequence="12">elements of the catalogues represents an encyclopedic or natural his torical urge (according to an ostensibly objective, rational Plinian model) whose single-sightedness (which reproduces itself as single citations) is, in fact, called into serious question by the text of "Cy clops." We can see this undercutting of the catalogue structure, not only in the haphazard organization and method of selection in many of the lists (see especially the lists of heroes and saints) but also in Joyce's self-reflexive awareness of the "infinity" of the catalogue. Note how he concludes the list of fish in the following passage from the beginning of "Cyclops": A pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous king dom too numerous to be enumerated. (U 12.70-74)18 Something fishy seems to be going on in this and other lists and enumerations. Are the catalogues a red herring made to keep the Joyce industry busy cataloguing, annotating, and explicating for hundreds of years?19 Just as the critics who proceed "catalogically" attempt to totalize the text by accounting for all of the elements in the catalogues, readers focusing on the narrative tend to be blind to the perfor mativity of the catalogues, excising them in order to see the episode as a relatively seamless and coherent political statement or cri tique. One of the more popular approaches to reading this very ideologically charged episode has been to outline its political and historical themes (nationalism, hospitality, kinship; Ireland's politics, economics, and history; Ireland's status in relation to England and Europe) and create a documentary-type narrative about Joyce's or the text's "politics." This kind of reading usually does.not account for the fact that the very structure of "Cyclops" threatens at the meta narrative level any objective, seamless conclusions. All the cata logues, as they interrupt the monologic flow of narrated conversa tion in the pub, disrupt the comfort of any totalizing reading or single political vision. The structure of "Cyclops" not only chal lenges how we read and talk about its themes, but it also reminds us of the seductiveness of narrative in the production of ideology and the telling, writing, and interpreting of history, including literary history. Because the episode makes us aware of narrative conven tions, it puts pressure on any critique that claims to read the episode as an implied narrative about Joyce's politics. The catalogue/narrative dichotomy can be thought of linearly, in 206</page><page sequence="13">terms of borders, or three-dimensionally, in terms of contours and elevations. The catalogues and interpolations, as they interrupt or disrupt the dialogue in the pub, implicitly create edges and borders between themselves and the narrative. The border disputes and dis cussions of "what is a nation?" that occur in the pub scene are re peated on a textual level, with the implicit question "what is a narra tive?" Catalogues, with their vertical, block-like structures, create bumps, elevations, contours, or landmarks on the more horizontal "plain" of the narrative. They can be seen as discursive cliffs or even "bluffs" on the textual map. Whichever way we look at them (with or without topographical metaphors), the catalogues force us to pause before the materiality of the text, before we make conclusions about the materiality of what it signifies. The current trend in literary criticism, cultural studies, is no less immune from the questions posed by these metanarrative issues in herent in the dichotomous structure of "Cyclops." It is with the pat terns introduced in the "Cyclops" episode (the catalogical disrup tion of an ostensibly seamless narrative) that we might begin to clarify and formalize the episode's challenge to what might be called the blind spot of the discipline of cultural studies, whose interpreta tions often rely on the "bluff" of narrative or an objective narrator to dramatize the implied cultural and political "story" of a given text (its underlying story about imperialism, nationalism, Irish politics, and so on). It may be that just as the catalogues in "Cyclops* under cut the pompous; moralizing, monological first-person narrative of the Citizen in the episode, the disruptive structure of the episode itself may very well undercut any confident telling of the text's polit ical narratives.

I am grateful to Fritz Senn for his help, in another context, with Homer's "Cyclops" episode as well as for directing me to his note on the Tree Wed ding, "Ramifications," JJQ, 19 (Winter 1982), 166-71. Further references will be cited parenthetically in the text. I would also like to thank Robert Oxley for offering detailed comments on my essay and for sharing with me his work on catalogues, "The Satirical Cataloguing pf Names in the 'Cyclops' Episode of James Joyce's Ulysses," forthcoming. 3 My essay on "Cyclops" takes a different tack than Vincent Cheng's address at the 1993 California Joyce Conference "What is a Nation?: Nation alism, Joyce and Ireland," though my discussion of the catalogue and the catalogic structure of "Cyclops" represents a metanarrative counterpoint to Cheng's discussion of the "monologic vision" of the characters in the pub. The catalogues undercut any smooth narrative flow and thus have disrup tive implications for the writing of history, including the history of national ism and Ireland. 4 Fritz Senn, "Ovidian Roots of Gigantism in Joyce's Ulysses," Journal of Modern Literature, 15 (Spring 1989), 567. Further references will be cited par enthetically in the text as "Roots." Senn calls for an extended study of Joyce's use of catalogues: "The Joycean variety of catalogues, lists, enumerations, does not seem to have been given much attention. It would be well worth an extended study" (p. 561). 5 Ovid, The Metamorphoses of Ovid, trans. Mary M. Innes (Harmonds worth: Penguin Books, 1970), 10:227. Further references will be cited paren thetically in the text by book and page number. 6 Senn himself suggests other possible sources, such as names of female friends, Greek anthropomorphism, and Hindu fertility rites, in his essay "Ramifications" (pp. 167,170). 7 It is interesting to note that this Ovidian intertext has been alluded to earlier in Ulysses when Bloom defines metempsychosis for Molly: "Metem psychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it. They used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for instance" (U 4.375-76). After "Cyclops," when Bloom thinks about metempsychosis again, his defi nition becomes more precise: "Metempsychosis. They believed you could be changed into a tree from grief" (U 13.1118-19). In addition, Bloom at the end of "Ithaca" and Molly at the end of "Penelope" think about fir trees (Miss Fir Conifer is the tree-bride of the list). While I do not want to overstate the importance of this catalogue, I do want to point out that, rather than being a detachable, superfluous unit ("deadwood"), it is actually connected, via an extended root system, to other parts of the text. 8 See Robert Scholes, "Ulysses: A Structuralist Perspective," "Ulysses": Fifty Years (Bloomington: Indiana Univ. Press, 1974), pp. 169-70. In a brief but interesting reading of the Tree Wedding, Scholes suggests that many of the ostensibly innocent names in the list are "comically sinister" (p. 169). 9 See Roland McHugh, Annotations to "Finnegans Wake" rev. ed. (Balti more: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1991), p. 98. 10 See Steven Barney, "Chaucer's Lists," The Wisdom of Poetry: Essays in Early English Literature in Honor of Morton W. Bloomfield, ed. Larry D. Benson and Siegfried Wenzel (Kalamazoo: Medieval Institute, 1982), pp. 189-223. Barney discusses the idea of the list as alien/intruder.

See Herbert Schneidau, "One Eye and Two Levels: On Joyce's 'Cyclops/" and David Hayman, "Two Eyes at Two Levels: A Response to Herbert Schneidau on Joyce's 'Cyclops/" JJQ, 16 (Fall 1978 Winter 1979), 95-103, 105-09. 12 See Colin MacCabe, James Joyce and the Revolution of the Word (London: Macmillan Publishers, 1978), p. 97. MacCabe advances the idea that "spe cific textual practices" in Joyce's work produce a "lack of identity," and al though he admits that these practices are "too numerous to catalogue in detail," he mentions the use of lists as one of the practices that Joyce em ploys. He discusses the Tree Wedding in some detail, though his argument does not proceed the way mine does. I focus on the splitting of the I/eye, while MacCabe emphasizes the differences between representations of real ity versus productions of a textual reality. 13 Pliny, Natural History, 10 vols., trans.

Vincent Cheng and Timothy Martin (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1984), p. 257. At the end of his essay, Senn invites scholars "with more systematic minds" to study Joyce's lists, but this tongue-in-cheek invi tation has serious critical and theoretical implications. What is needed to "enter" Joyce's lists is less a systematic mind than a multiperspectival ap proach focused on close readings and analyses that do not attempt to reduce the complexity of Joyce's texts or his intertexts, the kind of careful study that characterizes Senn's own work. 17 Andr?

Regarding this passage, Senn writes, "In one first sentence we have passed from specimens to generalities, then to mere numbers, and?finally?to the act of enumeration." 19 See Jacques Derrida, "Ulysses Gramophone: Hear say yes in Joyce," James Joyce: The Augmented Ninth, ed.
