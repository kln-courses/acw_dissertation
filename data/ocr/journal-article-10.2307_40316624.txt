In the second half of the eighteenth century the Russians, as the first Europeans to con- tact the Alutiit people of Kodiak Island, reported on the Alutiiq military strength and their sophisticated armament and military tactics. Oral traditions about intertribal warfare persist to this day, but these data have not been examined in depth in anthropological literature. This paper summarizes available information on Alutiiq weaponry, strategy and tactics, and traditions about enemies of Kodiak Islanders. Scarcely ten years after a Russian Navy squadron, under the over-all command of Commodore Bering, made landfalls along the coasts of Alaska, Russian entrepreneurs were operating in the Eastern Aleutians.1 Here one of the skippers, Stepan Glotov, in the early 1750s, encountered a Kodiak Islander who had been taken prisoner in his youth by eastern Aleut raiders. This captive, now a slave, joined the Russians and talked to them about the lands in the east, apparently extolling the riches in furs and timber of his native Kodiak (Black 1992:165, 171, 177 note 4; Clark 1975; Holmberg [1853] 1985:59). On his next voyage, Glotov, in command of the Sv. Andrean and Nataliia (1762-1766) out of Nizhnekamchatsk, sailed directly for Kodiak (Fig. 1), with only one brief stop at Umnak Island. He sailed his ship into the lagoon on southwest Kodiak Island, now known as Russian Harbor, and expected to enter into prof- itable trade with the local men. Instead, his vessel and camp were attacked and he barely managed to survive the winter. After negotiations in the spring, he ransomed from the men of Aiaktalik (a small island off southwestern Kodiak coast, then heavily populated) a young Aleut boy captured by the Kodiak Islanders around 1759 or 1758 on the island of Sanak, the easternmost of Fox Islands west of the Shumagins. The boy's village, appar- ently, had either been totally destroyed or, at best, decimated. He spoke of his sisters taken prisoner and suffering an unknown fate. The Russians learned quickly that Kodiak Islanders were formi- dable fighters and that Aleuts and Kodiak Islanders - the Alutiit, were hereditary enemies (J. L. S. 1776:102-130; Narochnitskii et al. 1989:101-110, doc. #29). This is confirmed today by traditions trans- mitted orally and artifacts recovered through archaeology. An archaeologist who lived on Kodiak recently wrote: "When I stop to think about the most impregnable refuge rock fortifications on Kodiak . . . [and] cliff top villages . . . they all face the western frontier ..." (Richard Knecht, personal communication 2002). Orthodox clergyman and Head of Mission, Archimandrite Ioasaf, was one of the earliest outside observers on Kodiak and makes the same observation between 1794 andl797 (Ioasaf n.d.). Ioann Veniaminov, another Orthodox clergyman who collected data in the eastern Aleutians and Sitka between 1824 and 1838, (more than half a century after first contact between the Russians and Alutiit) wrote: But with the Kad'iak people they had constant wars since time immemorial. The Aleuts consid- ered the Kad'iak people to be their irreconcilable enemies. The very word enemy, Angadutix, was Lydia T. Black, Professor Emerita, University of Alaska Fairbanks, P.O.

Veniaminov adds in a footnote that the Aleuts held the Kodiak Islanders in little esteem, claiming that the Kodiak Islanders provoked the disputes, knew no honor in battle, and lacked in bravery ([1840] 1984:205, note 3). The Kodiak Islanders, on the other hand, claimed that the Aleuts could never defeat them (Oral history testimonies made to the author).2 The early Russian skippers knew about this enmity very well, having directly experienced it. Aleuts played a major role as Russian allies on Kodiak Island and the Alaska Peninsula where the Alutiit engaged the Russians in hostilities.</page><page sequence="3">Armament 1 42 Arctic Anthropology 41 :2 Apparently, the presence of 60 Aleuts aboard Ocheredin's ship, the Sv. Kliment, on Kodiak during the winter 1779/1780 may have precipi- tated a conflict that resulted in heavy Russian casualties (Berkh [1823] 1974:57-58; Polonskii n.d., ms. 78V and F. 79; Shelikhov [1791] 1981:41). However, Kodiak Islanders had other ene- mies: the Chugach, the Dena'ina (Kenaitsy, the Tanaina Athapaskans), the Eyak, the Tlingit, and even possibly the Haida. In 1933, Makarii Chumovitskii, a Chugach (descended from a Kodiak family who had adopted the Russian name in 1790s) related how the Chugach took revenge upon the Alutiit from the island of Aiaktalik in the Kodiak archipelago. The men of Aiaktalik had abducted Chugach women in a raid upon a refuge rock at Hinchenbrook Island (de Laguna 1972, quoted in Crowell et al. 2001:52-53). Alaska Peninsula folklore is rich in war stories (Partnov 2001:40, 41, 42-48). Tlingit and Eyak with whom the Alutiit from Afognak-Shuyak islands area made war, considered the Alutiit veritable sav- ages who killed everyone in sight (de Laguna 1972:1:256-258). The savagery with which the wars were conducted is confirmed by oral history testimonies and also by a little-known incident that took place on an island the Russians named Ilmena Island, off the coast of California. The Alutiit hunters attacked and exterminated almost all Indian inhabitants there. The matter was investi- gated in 1818 by Hagemeister, the first Navy officer to be appointed Chief Manager of Russian America (Alaska). The Russian foreman, Iakov Babin, was held responsible for not having restrained his men (Pierce [1818] 1984:11, 138-139, 172). This episode entered American folklore and a book for children describing the event was published under the title "The Island of the Blue Dolphin" (O'Dell 1960). On the other hand, the Kodiak Islanders, according to local tradition, considered both the Aleuts and their northern and eastern enemies to be savages who attacked them without provoca- tion. To this day the Alutiit claim that Kodiak Islanders resorted to war only in defense of their homeland. This is a classic case of the pot calling the kettle black and vice-versa. It depends on who is telling the story. The Russians, who learned from the first instances of contact that the Kodiak Islanders were formidable warriors, avoided making landfalls in the archipelago until 1784, when Shelikhov arrived prepared to take Kodiak Island by armed conquest.3 Archimandrite Ioasaf, writing about the culture of Kodiak Islanders in response to a detailed questionnaire submitted to him by the Ruling Synod of the Orthodox Church of Russia, in the paragraph entitled "About War"4 stated5: War is for them [a] most pleasant exercise, though at present Russians prevent such. The Kad'iak inhabitants made war against the Aleuts of Ounalashka as well as against the Americans living in the Kenai (Cook) Inlet and Chugach (Prince William) Sound. They made wars constantly. For this reason there are many American captives on Kad'iak and Kad'iak islanders on the American [mainland] even now. The Company6 tries to free [ransom] them and returns them to their kinsmen; those who have no kin are taken into service, mostly as interpreters with [various] folks; some of these are employed in various capacities but mostly as interpreters. The aim of [such wars] is to obtain captives, clothing, and food supplies. Only minors and women are taken captive, adults and old ones are killed without mercy and under tor- ture.7 Among themselves, inhabitants of one settle- ment attack another one if they hear that they are being insulted: such and such is no warrior, he does not know how to hunt, but the greatest insult is when one has been called a woman. The one who suffered such an insult addresses all his kin and tries to persuade them to take revenge. Attacking the inhabitants of the other village suddenly [unexpect- edly], they kill them and loot the settlement. They set out on [long distance] raids to America [main- land] by entire villages in large skin baidaras taking along their entire families. Such raids happened fre- quently and it happened that [sometimes] not a sin- gle person returned [home]. In battle they use lances and arrows. (Ioasaf n.d.: ms. 26v-f.29) Ioasaf 's account of Alutiiq armament is less than complete. We must turn to Glotov and other Russian skippers and to Hieromonk Gideon, who was on Kodiak Island between 1804-1807, for more detailed descriptions of Kodiak Islanders' weaponry and battle tactics. Kodiak warriors went into battle wearing helmets that remind us of the famous Tlingit battle helmets. Only one pictorial representa- tion survives, that of a Kodiak war leader, from an album "Peoples of the Russian Empire" by ethno- graphic artist Karneev (Fig. 2).8 Glotov, in 1763, eventually bartered for and brought to Russia five hats and helmets (Narochnitskii et al. 1989:108). In another version of Glotov's report, published in the eighteenth century (J.L.S. 1776:102-130), there is mention that the attackers of the Russian camp wore various hats, many fantastical ones. Gedeon men- tions battle helmets or hats made either of wood or thick animal skin (Gideon 1989:42). Gedeon also mentions a collar made of tightly woven sinew that protected the neck (Gideon 1989:42). No ethno- graphic examples of such a protective collar are known. In order to intimidate the enemy, warriors painted their faces red and, when advancing, shouted fierce battle cries. Body armor, both rod and slat armor (Fig. 3 and 4), was worn by every warrior. Some sources</page><page sequence="4">Black: Warriors of Kodiak 1 43 Figure 2.

(Gideon, Ioasaf to cite but two) specify that such armor was made of wood, but Glotov mentions that some people had slat armor fashioned out of whale bone. I have seen one ethnographic example, col- lected ca. 1836, of walrus ivory, from Kodiak.9 Remnants of wooden slat and rod armor have been recovered archaeologically at Karluk and are pre- served in the Alutiiq Museum in Kodiak. In addition to body armor, each warrior car- ried a wooden shield (Fig. 5). There is in Alutiiq Museum an example of an almost intact shield recovered at Karluk. Gideon describes the complex construction of armor and shields, though regret- tably not in sufficient detail (Gideon 1989:42). In addition, when attacking, Kodiak warriors used a protective device described by Glotov, hereafter</page><page sequence="5">1 44 Arctic Anthropology 4 1 :2 Figure 3.

Thirty to 40 war- riors could advance under protection of such shield walls. Musket balls could not penetrate these shields (J.L.S. 1776; Narochnitskii et al. 1989:105-106). The shield wall constituted the center of the formation when the Kodiak Islanders attacked an enemy in the open battle. Individual warriors advanced along the flanks, each carrying a shield and assisted by boys who brought up addi- tional arrow supplies. The main weapon was a complex bow. Several examples exist in ethnographic collections of Europe and America and a few have been recov- ered archaeologically. The bow (Fig. 6) was held in the left hand. Each archer carried a wooden quiver. Sometimes archers were accompanied by young boys, a sort of equerry to carry the famous Kodiak</page><page sequence="6">Black: Warriors ofKodiak 1 45 i I is CO rH I 1 Q Í |! «I ^^ ^.2 li §i Í* 11 Ü ¡!</page><page sequence="7">1 46 Arctic Anthropology 4 1 :2 elaborately painted wooden quivers. These can be seen in a painting by Mikhail Tikhanov, staff painter on Golovnin's second expedition to Alaska in 1818. This painting shows the archer holding the bow horizontally. This was probably because archers traveled in two-hatch kayaks, occupying the front hatch. A vertical orientation of the bow would have been difficult to achieve from this position. According to the painting, the archer pulled the sinew bowstring in an unusual way, palm up. The spear-throwers of the sword-shaped type were used only at sea (Fig. 7). War clubs were used on land, usually when an enemy party was taken by surprise or to take out enemy sentries. One such club was excavated at Karluk (see Fig. 5, object to left of shield). Elegant stone battle-hatchets were also used. These were usually decorated at the haft with either one or two carved human heads (Fig. 8, after Volkov and Rudenko 1910). Several examples, collected before 1850, survive in ethnographic col- lections. To my knowledge, none have been exca- vated archaeologically. It is possible, however, that the business end of such hatchets may have been classified as adzes or axes. It is possible that human figurines, having shapeless torsos and a crudely carved face, might also have been found by archae- ologists, but not recognized as parts of a weapon. Strategy and Tactics As mentioned earlier, strategic objectives of such inter-tribal warfare were the capture of women and slaves and acquisition of loot. The leader distrib- uted the spoils of war to his followers. The main leadership requirement among the Alutiit was proven military ability - hunting prowess was sec- ondary. This was observed by Ioasaf (1794-1797) and Gideon (1804-1807) and confirmed in modern times by tradition bearers. Only a proven war leader could muster a large raiding party (Gideon 1989:42-43). Ordinarily, war parties were assem- bled by invitation. However, assistance would be summoned by means of signal fires in emergencies, when attacked or when support against enemy of greater strength was needed (Oral testimonies to the author, Polonskii n.d. f. 81 for 21 June 1782 for Upper Alaska Peninsula). The Alutiit had a sophis- ticated signal system that used fires. For example, in the southwest, the villages of Old Kaguyak and Two Headed Island maintained a constant lookout on Knoll Point, a location that has unlimited visi- bility in all directions. If an enemy kayak fleet was sighted, signal fires were lit indicating, not only the approach of the enemy, but also their strength (Innokentii and Ksenofont Zeedar, Larry Matfay). A signal fire lit at Knoll Point would be sighted at neighboring villages and fires repeating the mes- sage would be lit there. The news was picked up at more distant villages as far away as Alitak Bay and Sitkalidak Island (Innokentii and James Zeedar 1991). In addition, swift runners, specially trained young men, would be sent by land. Thus, the Alutiit were able to muster large bodies of warriors in a short time and, if the enemy was especially strong or dangerously close, they could evacuate women and children to refuge areas with great rapidity. Such areas of retreat were steep-sided, small, rocky islets with difficult or secret access or areas where women and children could find shel- ter and food. One such area was, according to tradi- tion, Women's Bay, an inner bay of Chiniak, near the modern city of Kodiak (William Hartman, per- sonal communication 1998). When Alutiit planned an attack, the main body of the war party traveled to the target area in large skin boats. The attack force numbered up to 30 baidaras each carrying about 20 men. Individual warriors often accompanied the baidara fleet in two- or single-hatch kayaks. Sea battles were rare and no tradition bearer has mentioned any. Apparently, in the wars with the Aleuts, engagements at sea were avoided, presumably because of the superiority of eastern Aleutian war kayaks. The latter had greater speed and maneuver- ability than the Kodiak vessels (Veniaminov [1840] 1984:208)10. On land, the aim was a surprise attack on a settlement. Houses were set on fire and the dwellers "smoked out." Glotov describes an attempt to burn his ship. The Alutiit attacked at night on October 1, 1763, but were repulsed by musket fire. The retreating Alutiit dropped scaling ladders and bundles of dry grass and birch bark.11 When an armed enemy body was encoun- tered, a well-organized battle ensued. Such battles between Alutiit and the Russians are mentioned several times, but there are only three brief descrip- tions. One describes three attacks upon Glotov's crew at Russian Harbor on Kodiak in 1763. The second describes an encounter with Polutov's men in Ugak Bay in 1774 (Berkh [1823] 1974:53).12 The third, and the only detailed narrative, describes a battle between a combined Aleut and Russian force and the Alutiit of Katmai and Karluk that took place on the Alaska Peninsula near Sutkum (mod- ern Sutwik) Island in 1782 (Polonskii n.d.). The last description is interesting, because it illustrates the Alutiit way of controlling an engagement. If Alutiit could choose the battleground, especially in their own territory, they made sure that a defensive position, a fortress (refuge) rock well prepared for a siege, was nearby. That is, they always strove to have a fallback position. This was the case in the 1782 open battle, which ended in a draw. The combined Aleut-Russian force proved superior, compelling the Alutiit to take up their defensive position, prepared beforehand on a fortress rock, and forcing the enemy to invest it. Eventually, the</page><page sequence="8">Black: Warriors ofKodiak 147 3.5 s g ss * cr E = S- |«g ¡ £§ &gt; &amp; if ACT) II II li Él si w ss Is •5 co 1,3 ti 4" ti 4" 11 is o oo o oo ■ss &amp;&lt; 2 3 II</page><page sequence="9">148 Arctic An thropology 4 1 :2 Figure 8. Alutiiq battle-hatchets and associated anthropomorphic images. After Volkov and Rudenko 1910. Alutiit ran out of drinking water and food. Though the Russians lifted the siege and sailed to Cook Inlet,13 it was a hollow victory for the Alutiit who lost more than 40 persons to hunger. When enemies landed in their territory, it was standard Alutiit practice to deny the invaders access to food supplies (mollusks on the reefs and tide flats, and fish). They employed this tactic in 1763 against Glotov, who lost several men due to food deprivation, and against Ocheredin in Alitak Bay in 1779-1780, causing the latter to lose 20 men. (Berkh [1823] 1974:57-58). On their home ground, Alutiit often resorted to various ruses. At Shuyak Island,14 for example, it is reported that Aleut raiders made camp (or were "encouraged" by unstated means to do so) in bays where at the ebb the quicksand tide flats were exposed. Trying to launch their kayaks, they all perished. This story about death "in mud" was picked up by Pinart in 1872 and recounted by John Pestriakov in the 1980s. Another account, this one from the southwest Kodiak, describes luring the Aleut raiders into the waters around Two-Headed Island, notorious for it's offshore rocks. Afognak tradition also maintains that ancient village sites were placed where submerged and semi- submerged rocks made access difficult for those who were not familiar with the local shore condi- tions. While the enemies were helpless trying to keep their kayaks from going onto the rocks, the Alutiit attacked. One method was the use of heavy logs lashed together and rolled upon the attackers. Ephraim Agnot recounted (1986): And then they had these logs, drift logs along the shore and big logs. Then they tie them with some kind of grass or a kelp or whatever it was. Them days they did not have no rope. And that was a weapon for mass killing. So when they see them kayaks coming across the straits - they always have lookouts up there - said: well here they are! They are coming! They ready and don't go down the beach. And just they [the enemy] come on the beach - in these slopes [they have] cut every- thing - let all these logs roll and kill them all. Several Russian fur hunters of the eighteenth century also report the use of rocks hurled down the slopes of fortress refuges against those attempt- ing to scale them. Interestingly, Alutiit would also attempt to scale refuge rocks where their enemies or their enemies' women were sheltering. In the field, ladders were made of spear shafts, according to Makarii Chumovitskii (Crowell et al. 2001:52). When an enemy landed and scouts reported that they were resting or asleep, the Alutiit approached stealthily to take out any sentries (a tactic they attempted at least three times in 1763 against Glotov) and then clubbed the sleeping enemy:</page><page sequence="10">Summary Black: Warriors ofKodiak 1 49 Oh, they killed. When they sleep, it's like summer- time. Someone lies and watches. Keeps an eye on everything. But they catch that one first, see? They - everybody is still sleeping . . . They catch that one somehow. You got to watch. Somebody got to stand by and watch them as they come through Uganik Pass. They catch them first. And they kill the rest . . . That's why they claim that West could never win. (Larry Matfay 1987) Aleuts, when on a raid, traveled light and ate only what they could collect on the beaches or off- shore reefs (Veniaminov [1840] 1984:205). Alutiit apparently knew that and left caches of food near convenient beaches where the enemy might land, not only to distract them, but to induce sleep after a good meal: And then they had one trick, too, these people from this island. They know that the Aleuts down the Aleutian Chain they like to eat boiled fish. They love it. They were stealing from these people now and then. They [the Alutiit] said "we'll fix you." And then they cooked the whole big bunch of fish, boiled fish, seal oil to go with it. And they put it somewhere they could, the enemy could, get hold of it. And they gets hold of them and they ate so much and they got sleepy . . . They fell all asleep tired and the guys come out and start clubbing them to death. Easy prey. See that's why this island won in these wars . . . (Ephraim Agnot 1986) When an enemy raiding party was attacked, a number of young men, probably boys, were dis- patched to destroy the enemy kayaks to prevent any escape. When forced to take up positions on fortress rocks, the Alutiit hoisted their kayaks up by means of kelp ropes to preserve them (oral his- tory testimonies to the author). Though the main body of the war stories told in the twentieth cen- tury by a number of elders now gone deal with wars against the Aleuts, there is also a persistent account that the Tlingit invaded Kodiak, primarily the Afognak area (John Pestriakov 1987). Other el- ders state that the invading Tlingit were victorious. When devastating an enemy village, it was cus- tomary to leave two persons alive to tell the story of their defeat. Such places were then called a "place of crying" - kiyaviq [word used by Alutiiq, and other Eskimoan-speaking groups]. Several places in Kodiak Archipelago are so designated. Though recent storytellers maintain that it was the defeated enemies that were crying, it is perhaps more likely that those weeping were the survivors of enemy raids. The number of Kodiak slaves and women encountered by Russians in the eighteenth century in the Aleutians and on Alaska mainland, even among the Tlingit (sold from one group to another apparently starting with Prince William Sound area or Yakutat Bay) is evidence that the Alutiit were not always victorious. But there were Aleut slaves and women captured by Kodiak Islanders in offensive raids also. The story of a qaspeq [Alutiiq: leader, a wise man] who joined Glotov and then Shelikhov in 1784 is well known (Black 1992; Holmberg [1853-56] 1863). Other captives and especially captive women, Alutiiq and Aleut, were forgotten both by their communities and by their captors. And there were many such women, for they are frequently mentioned by the early Russian invaders. In 1782, during the battle and subsequent siege near Sutkum, several Aleut captive women managed to escape from the fortress rock. These women were not only slaves but also concubines and no doubt were transmitters of cultural traits from one group to another. In all probability, it was the women who transmitted folktales about wars to their children. For example, the story about the use of puppets on the ramparts of fortress rocks was recorded in 1872 by Pinart on Afognak Island and I encountered it again at Sand Point in 1986 when interviewing former inhabitants of Unga in the Shumagin Islands. Puppets were manipulated and the enemy, believing them to be warriors, expended all of their ammunition shooting at the puppets. When they were out of arrows or spears cast by throwing boards from kayaks (as was the case at Unga), the defenders rolled down rocks and previously prepared driftwood logs upon the enemy kayaks (Bruce Foster and Andrew Gronholdt, personal communication 1988). Stories of women left alone in the settlements or on refuge rocks spoiling the attackers intent also survive in Aleut and Alutiiq folklore. In an Aleut version, when a Koloshi [Tlingit] war party came to a settle- ment, a woman with a deep voice spoke like a man. The raiders, fearing that there were many men on guard stood off while a young boy summoned help from men hunting elsewhere. Alutiit speak of women alone with their children on a fortress rock painting or gluing on mustaches and pretending to be warriors inducing the enemy to leave (Richard Knecht, personal communication 2002). Alutiit, like their neighbors, the eastern Aleuts to the west and Tlingit and Athapaskans to the south- east and northeast, were a warrior society. To be a man was to be a warrior. Pride in this warrior tradi- tion survived well into the twentieth century. The elders who knew of these traditions are now gone or quite old. I chose this topic to remind the younger people, both the Alutiit as well as non- Alutiiq scholars, that in the past Kodiak Islanders proudly and fiercely defended their independence with armed might.
