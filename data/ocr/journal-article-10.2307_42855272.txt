The failure to deal in a satisfactory manner with these issues has led to a theoretical impasse that present theorising does not seem able to overcome. Key words: agency/structure, micro/macro, post-modernism, reification / reductionism. Introduction The subject of this paper is neither an exhaustive analysis of the major trends in sociological theory today, nor a systematic treatment of key issues and debates in that discipline.1 It is rather to express, in somewhat eclectic and idiosyncratic manner, some tentative views (based on a long-term involvement with problems in sociological theory during both teaching and research) on what went wrong in the development of sociological theory, and whether or not we can do anything about it at present. The emphasis will be less on the history or the sociology of sociological theory, and more on reasons internal to the logic of the discipline - reasons that not only inform us about the nature of the present unsatisfactory state of affairs, but also suggest possible ways of overcoming it. PART ONE On the Rise and Fall of Modern Sociological Theory An important feature of classical sociology was its relative non- differentiation or separation between theory and empirical analysis. In so far as the founding fathers developed their theories in order to understand the kind of society that emerged in the aftermath of the industrial and French revolutions, the connections were very close between their analyses of industrial societies on the one hand, and theoretical and methodological insights on the other. This close link between theoretical and empirical concerns could not withstand the growth, during this century, of sociological theory as a distinct subfield of sociological enquiry. Some observers consider</page><page sequence="2">676 NICOS MOUZELIS the relative divorce between theory and empirical research an unfortunate development that could not help but lead to the arid theorising such as is found in Parsons' work, the excessive abstractedness of which renders it 'untestable' (Mills 1959). Others, myself included, do not believe this development to be as regrettable as critics of Parsonian functionalism would imply; they see it, if not as unavoidable, then as an irreversible result of the growing division of labour within sociology.2 In any case, the charge of abstractedness and non-verifiability is ill-placed, since the chief aim of modern sociological theory is not to fashion substantive statements that can be tested against reality, but to construct what Althusser calls Generalities II, and what non-Marxist sociologists call conceptual frameworks or paradigms: i.e. sets of logically interrelated conceptual tools for looking at social phenomena in such a way that interesting questions are generated and methodologically proper linkages established between different levels of analysis. In that sense, sociological theory does not consist of, and does not aim directly at establishing empirically testable hypotheses, it is merely meant to prepare the ground for an empirical investigation of social structures and actors. While, therefore, the emergence of modern sociological theory has meant a break with the great classical syntheses, it has not estranged itself from empirical research altogether. On the contrary, the work of the first gener- ation of sociological theorists (I have in mind here writers like Parsons, Merton, Gouldner, Lockwood) expresses a clear concern with providing conceptual tools facilitating empirical investigation. This is apparent from both the conceptual frameworks elaborated, and from the fact that such frameworks were systematically applied in practice - either by the theorists themselves and/or by their disciples - as a means of generating empirically oriented accounts of the social world. Using an evolutionist vocabulary, one can say that the differentiation between sociological theory and the more empirically-oriented sub-disciplines was accompanied by integrative mech- anisms that ensured some linkages between theory and empirical research. It seems to me that it is in this light that one should assess Parsons' complex work, which has contributed most to establishing sociological theory as a specialised sub-discipline. Despite its numerous shortcomings, the Parsonian framework could, and did, lead to considerable empirical research on both the micro and the macro levels of analysis (e.g. Almond and Verba 1963; Barber 1952; Bellah 1970; Deutsch 1963; Eisenstadt 1963; Levy 1949; Lipset 1963; Smelser 1960). However, although Parsonian sociological theory successfully advanced the intellectual division of labour within sociology without breaking the link between theory and research, it did less well in terms of the conceptual tools it offered. Applied to empirical issues, these tools sys- tematically neglected the voluntaristic dimensions of social life, and this led more or less directly to a reified, positivistic, and often teleological treatment of social phenomena. As numerous critics have pointed out again and again,</page><page sequence="3">THE POVERTY OF SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY 677 Parsons - especially when his analysis progressed from his early theory of social action to a theorisation of social systems, and their long-term evolution - over-emphasised the systemic-functionalist dimensions of social systems at the expense of agency. His theory either portrays agents as passive outcomes of a system of core societal values, or ignores them entirely. More precisely, on the level of micro-action , Parsons fails to develop a theory of interaction , his analysis moving abruptly from a theorisation of unit acts to a theorisation of social systems (Turner 1990; Habermas 1987). As a result of this omission, Parsons' role players seem to be exclusively guided by normative considerations, as core values are institutionalised into role expect- ations and internalised into need dispositions. On the macro-societal level of analysis on the other hand, agents tend to disappear altogether since Parsons conceptualises society in terms of four sub-systems, each consisting of a set of institutionalised norms geared to the solution of society's four functional problems (adaptation, goal-achievement, integration and latency - AGIL for short). Since each sub-system is further divided according to the same AGIL logic into four sub-sub-systems, social reality ultimately becomes a complex of systems within systems within systems. In this onion-like construct, macro actors such as interest groups, social movements, etc., do not seem to have a theoretically worked-out place.3 In what follows, I shall argue that post-Parsonian sociological theory took two directions , both of which are on the whole negative. (i) Those who have continued in the Parsonian tradition (which, in parti pris fashion I shall call sociological theory 'proper'), by over-reacting to the ultra-systemic and reifying features of strutuctural-functionalism, have theor- ised action and interaction in a manner which creates insurmountable obstacles to the study of how micro situations, on which they were ex- clusively focusing, are linked up with macro-institutional structures and actors. This lopsidedness - which led to a systematic neglect of social hier- archies and to an ever widening rift between micro and macro sociology - was not corrected by relevant theoretical developments outside interpretative micro sociology, such as structuration theory and rational-choice analysis. (ii) The other major reaction to Parsonian functionalism (initially led by politically radical sociologists incensed by Parsons' neglect of collective action and struggles) turned its attention first to conflict theory, then to Marxism and finally, after the demise of Marxism in the 1980s, to post-structuralist/ post-modernist approaches to the social. Post-modernist theorists reject, not only Parsons' conceptualisation of system and action, but also his attempt (quite positive, as I see it) to establish sociological theory as a specialised sub-discipline of sociology - i.e. as an intellectual activity portraying a specific logic of analysis quite distinct from that of philosophy or of theorising in other, neighbouring disciplines. This second group of critics, rejecting the crude positivism and theoretical provincialism of Parsonian-influenced, early postwar sociology, shifted their</page><page sequence="4">678 NICOS MOUZELIS attention to philosophical issues and/or theoretical developments in fields such as linguistics, semiotics, psychoanalysis, etc. The desire to break through entrenched barriers and to broaden the horizons of a hitherto inward-looking discipline was reflected in the very terminology, sociological theory becoming social theory. However, as I shall argue extensively below, the broader outlook was not accompanied by any theoretically coherent and systematic attempt to translate insights derived from philosophy and other disciplines into the framework of sociological theory proper. Instead, sociological theorising gave way to dis- cussions on ontological/epistemological issues, and to attempts at reducing the study of complex societies to that of language, signs, texts, the un- conscious, etc. The result of all this has been a serious disconnection between theory and empirical research, a disconnection that is found neither in Parsonian sociology nor in the micro-sociological writings of the first group of critics. All in all, I would say that the present malaise that many sociologists sense vis-Ã -vis 'theory' is due to a dual failure: those who tried to continue the research-oriented, specialised theorising that Parsons and his disciples had initiated have, by dealing exclusively with Parsons' underemphasis of micro interaction, neglected macro actors and failed, therefore, to redress the balance of system and action. In the process, the already existing linkages between micro and macro sociology were destroyed. Those, for their part, who rejected both the specific framework of Parsons' structural functionalism as well as the kind of specialised sociological theorising of which Parsons himself was the main protagonist have, for the most part, ended up with theorisations that are neither good philosophy nor good sociological theory - i.e. theorisations that are of little practical use to research-oriented socio- logists. What this means, of course, is an overall impoverishment of both the empirical and the theoretical branches of sociology. The Impasses of Micro- Sociological Theorising With the middle and late period of Parsons' oeuvre marked by an under- emphasis of both micro and macro actors, the various interpretative socio- logies that mushroomed from the 1960s onwards have almost entirely focused on the former. This disregard of macro actors has had grave consequences for the further development of sociological theory as such. There are several explanations for this surprising neglect by theorists whose avowed purpose had been to redress Parsons' overly systemic analysis and to 'bring back people' into sociological studies. One obvious reason is the excessive fear of reification that haunts herme- neutically and ethnomethodologically oriented sociologists. For them, any</page><page sequence="5">THE POVERTY OF SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY 679 reference to organisations of larger collectivities as having goals, taking decisions, implementing policies, etc., smacks of anthropomorphism, of endowing collectivities with characteristics proper only to individual human actors. Another reason that partly explains the reluctance of interpretative socio- logists to deal with macro actors is their populistic predilection for 'lay persons', 'ordinary' members of society, 'mundane' encounters. As a result they ignore not only collective actors but also what, for convenience, one may call mega actors - i.e. individual actors in control of considerable resources, whose decisions stretch widely in space and time. In other words, micro sociologists tend to forget that actors, because of their very unequal access to the economic, political and cultural means of production, contribute un- equally to the construction of social reality. Attempting, however, to explain the symbolic construction of social wholes by exclusive reference to 'lay persons' or 'ordinary' members is like trying to account for the construction of a complex edifice by reference only to bricklayers, completely ignoring the contribution of architects, managers, foremen, accountants, lawyers, etc. (Mouzelis 1991a: 67). A third reason for the neglect of macro actors in interpretative sociology is the all-pervasive association of agency with the micro and institutional structures with the macro level of analysis. This association makes itself felt particularly strongly in respect of face-to-face interactions which, as a matter of course, are invariably considered as micro phenomena, as the building blocks out of which macro-institutional orders are constructed. Whether one looks at the writings of Garfinkel, Cicourel, Goffman or their numerous disciples, one always comes up against the ubiquitous idea that to study face-to-face interaction is to study micro-phenomena; and given this, the problem becomes one of linking face-to-face encounters on the micro level with institutional structures on the macro level.4 But linking face-to-face interaction with the micro level becomes absurd when one considers that face-to-face interactions are not the privilege of 'ordinary' members of society but may occur between 'non-ordinary' ones as well. To give an obvious example: the face-to-face encounter between Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin at Yalta in 1945 led to crucial decisions which, among other things, shaped the postwar map of Europe and pro- foundly affected the lives of millions of people. In what sense can this interaction between these three men be seen as a micro event? Another important point that must be stressed here is that the identi- fication of interaction with micro, and of institutions with macro, leads to an underemphasis of social hierarchies , of the fact that institutionalised positions/ roles and actors are often related not only horizontally but also vertically. So, for instance, social actors being part of a multiplicity of hierarchically organised wholes (corporations, trade unions, political parties, etc.) deal routinely with other actors hierarchically both subordinate and superordinate.</page><page sequence="6">680 NICOS MOUZELIS (The same can be said, of course, when the focus is not on actors and interactions but on hierarchically organised positions.) In view of the above, one cannot consider the passage from the micro to the meso and macro levels of analysis without seriously taking into account how modern societies are hierarchically organised, and particularly how micro actors are hierarchically related (through formal organisations or otherwise) to meso and macro actors. Micro sociology ignores all of this, insisting that actors and face-to-face interactions belong to the micro, and institutional structures to the macro level. This absurd but strongly rooted misconception precludes any study of how micro, meso and macro actors relate to each other within specific hierarchically-organised institutional contexts. It is not at all surprising, therefore, that the present debate on the links between micro and macro sociology, as well as the older, related debate on methodological indivi- dualism versus holism, have led precisely nowhere. Not only do neither of these debates theorise the concept of social hierarchies, but they also both leave it out of account altogether as though it did not exist. Trying, however, to investigate how micro actors and encounters relate to the constitution, reproduction and transformation of large collectivities, without taking into serious account the hierarchical aspects of social wholes, is like trying to swim in a pool that has been drained of water. The above point can be made more concrete by a brief examination of some recent attempts at bridge-building between micro and macro levels of analysis. Randall Collins (1981), for instance, taking into consideration the current emphasis on intersubjectivity, argues that the basic unit of analysis in sociology is not the individual but the face-to-face micro encounter. What, in fact, can provide micro foundations of large-scale social phenomena is not methodological individualism but 'methodological situationalism' - an approach that focuses on micro events or encounters, on individuals inter- acting within specific micro situations. Macro phenomena for Collins 'are made up of aggregations and repetitions of many similar micro-events' (1981b: 988), and what we usually call social structure is 'nothing more than large numbers of micro-encounters repeated (or sometimes changing) over time and actors' space' (1987: 195). Now once one realises that a single face-to-face encounter can be a macro event (in the sense that it can have an impact stretching very widely in time/space), then the notion that we can move from micro to macro through aggregative means is seen to be not always valid. Very often macro events relate to micro ones via a logic of subsumption rather than aggregation. This is so particularly when we focus on hierarchically organised configuration al rather than aggregative wholes.5 If Collins tries to constitute macro phenomena exclusively via aggregative procedures, Knorr-Cetina (1981, 1988) constitutes them via a logic of</page><page sequence="7">THE POVERTY OF SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY 681 representation: macro phenomena are nothing more than 'summary repre- sentations' - such representations being created by lay persons or theorists who try to make sense of micro events entailing interacting individuals in myriad micro situations. For instance, references to such macro phenomena as the state or the world market, or to such macro events as wars, are merely second-order theoretical constructs, i.e. they exist only in the minds of lay persons or theorists as rough summaries of a multitude of micro realities. Again, what is misleading in the above ethnomethodologically-based attempt at providing linkages between micro and macro sociology is the idea that all face-to-face encounters are always micro events. Given that such encounters are the building blocks of all social reality, macro phenomena are denied existence as first-order constructs, and are admitted only as 'repre- sentations' that ordinary people or theorists construct. This nominalist view of macro phenomena can be easily refuted by pointing out that face-to-face encounters are not necessarily micro, that they can constitute macro events in their own right. To conclude: in so far as micro sociologists keep ignoring social hierarchies linking micro, meso, and macro actors, and view macro phenomena as mere additions or representations of micro events, they do not provide micro foundations at all, but simply a false, reductive picture of the social world. It must at last be realised that no amount of theorising, or rather philosophising, about the ontology of the subject and the nature of inter- action can help to bridge the micro-macro gap as long as human interaction continues to be conceptualised in a hierarchical vacuum. The micro-macro issue can be solved properly only by taking seriously into account the hierarchical and onion-like system-within-system nature of all complex, differentiated social wholes. The Micro-Macro and the Agency Structure Issues: Other Attempts at Synthesis In the previous section I have examined some of the reasons why interpretatively oriented sociologies, in trying to deal with the problems created by the oversystemic character of Parsonian theory, have failed to provide effective bridges between micro and macro sociology. In this section I shall refer to some other well known attempts to tackle the action-system and/or the micro-macro issues, attempts that derive from quite different theoretical traditions: to Giddens' structuration theory, Habermas' theory of communicative action, rational-choice theory as well as neo-functionalist efforts to restructure Parsons' theory. Since I have dealt with most of these approaches elsewhere (Mouzelis 1991a) and due to space limitations, I would simply state rather than demonstrate their problematic character as far as the macro-micro and agency/ structure problems are concerned.</page><page sequence="8">682 NICOS MOUZELIS Starting with Giddens, I would like, in the first place, to point out that Giddens, unlike most theoretically oriented social theorists refused to jump into the Marxist/Althusserian bandwagon in the 60s and 70s and in the Foucault-Derridean one in the 80s. Although sympathetic to both traditions, he tried to translate a variety of insights derived from these and other theoretical traditions into a sociologically relevant vocabulary. In that sense (despite his preference for labelling his theory social rather than sociological) he can rightly be seen as the major heir of Parsons' mantle. On the other hand, Giddens' structuration theory, as an attempt, among other things, to bring closer together interpretative and structural sociologies, presents serious shortcomings. In so far as it is based on the duality of structure notion, it is unable to account for cases where actors do not merely use structures (i.e. for Giddens' rules and resources) in a taken-for-granted fashion - but rather adopt a strategic distance from them in order to under- stand them or assess the chances of their maintenance/transformation. In such cases one needs a concept of subject /object dualism rather than duality, for it is only on the basis of such a concept that one can explain how and why actors do not merely reproduce but also can radically transform rules and resources. Moreover, Giddens, while rejecting the conventional distinction between agency and structure, is obliged to bring it in by the back door by proposing the distinction between institutional analysis and analysis in terms of strategic conduct (1984: 289). Given this, it is not surprising that his rejection of functionalist explana- tions is merely rhetorical - in the sense that he simply avoids functionalist terminology while retaining the logic of non-teleological, functionalist ex- planations (Giddens 1982, ch. 2). Finally, Giddens' attempt to replace the micro-macro distinction with the social-system integration one (1984: 64-68) leads him erroneously to identify face-to-face interactions with actions whose consequences do not stretch widely in time/space (Mouzelis 1991a: 31-34). As far as Habermas' theory of communicative rationality is concerned, his rather wholesale adoption of Parsons' oversystemic AGIL scheme leads him to an underemphasis of collective actors; and this in turn seriously under- mines his ambitious attempt to integrate systemic and life- world approaches. For instance, when Habermas talks about the colonisation of the life-world by the system in modern societies (by the penetration of systemic, steering media into the spheres of kinship and public-opinion formation, spheres where it is communicative rather than instrumental rationality that should be dominant) he never shows how this process of 'technicization' or colonisation takes place. Like Parsons, he rarely asks zu/Åo-questions. Apart from vague references to 'new social movements', we are left completely in the dark as to the groups or interests that resist, and those that promote this process. Habermas goes hardly at all into questions of how macro actors control the major means of economic, political and cultural production, and how they contribute to the colonising process. As a result, his work provides brilliant</page><page sequence="9">THE POVERTY OF SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY 683 descriptions but no explanations of macro-societal transformation. Thus the colonisation process, entailing the penetration of the life-world by the system, is as opaque as Parsons' notion of 'core values' controlling everything via institutionalisation and internalisation (Mouzelis 1991a: 187-189). Coming now to theorists who try to revive Parsonian functionalism by introducing concepts referring to collective actors, class struggles, etc. (Alexander 1985; Alexander and Colomy 1990). As in Habermas' case, such efforts have not been very successful. Neo-functionalists have tried to inject a voluntaristic, collective action dimension into Parsonian functionalism and evolutionism - but in so far as they accept rather than radically change Parsons' AGIL schema, the articu- lation between the analysis of institutional structures and collective actors remains ad hoc. For instance, Colomy (1985) tries to link processes of uneven differentiation with the struggle of strategic groups to bring about or resist institutional differentiation. But the exact linkages between institutional incompatibilities and collective struggles remains unspecified. Finally, rational choice theory as, among other things, an attempt to bridge the micro-macro gap by providing the micro foundations of macro pheno- mena, faces the following dilemma: in so far as its mainly logico-deductive theorising refuses to take into account the various socio-historical contexts within which rationality takes its specific forms, its statements (as all trans-historical, universalistic statements) tend to be either wrong or trivial. On the other hand, when rational choice theory takes institutional context seriously into account, it loses its distinctive profile and its logico-deductive elegance (Elster 1986; Mouzelis 1991a: 146-158; 1993). PART TWO In the preceding sections some of the reasons were examined why socio- logical theory has not succeeded in overcoming the major weaknesses of the Parsonian paradigm and creating more effective linkages between micro and macro approaches, nor between approaches primarily emphasising agency and those emphasising institutional structures. This failure has created a void within sociological theory proper, and part of the space has been filled by a marked preoccupation with philosophical issues and theoretical developments in disciplines like linguistics and psychoanalysis. This is particularly true of theoretical approaches influenced by post- structuralist/post-modernist orientations to the social sciences. Here the reaction to sociological theory is rather radical, in that it rejects not only such distinctions as agency/structure or micro/macro, but equally all conventional boundaries between social-science disciplines and sub-disciplines. To use evolutionary terminology again, if the emergence of sociological theory as a specialised sub-discipline indicates a process of differentiation on the level of</page><page sequence="10">684 NICOS MOUZELIS social knowledge, the new trends in theory point to a process of dedifferen- tiation (Lash 1990), to a deliberate attempt to weaken or abolish the, established boundaries between philosophy, linguistics, psychoanalysis and the various social-science disciplines and subdisciplines. In this section I will focus on the specific forms that the postmodern critique of conventional sociological theory takes - paying particular attention to the implications of such a critique for the micro-macro and agency- structure issues. Broadly speaking, postmodernism opposes conventional theory on three fronts. It is against foundationalism, against the notion of the centered subject and against the notion of representation. Anti-Foundationalism Postmodern writers reject all and any theoretical effort at finding universal criteria that could provide unshakeable foundations for a theory of the social. They consider any attempt at epistemological grounding, any effort to establish first principles as Utopian - and they consider as equally Utopian any theory that tries to formulate general laws or general propositions that might help to explain society or social development holistically. They argue that, given the fragile, chaotic, transient and discontinuous character of the social, any holistic theory imposes an order and a systemness on the social world that, in fact, exists only in the confused minds of social scientists (Lyotard 1974). If we now try to look critically at the anti-foundationalist thesis, we can start by agreeing with post-modernists that the interminable efforts of social scientists to elaborate some first principles which would provide incontro- vertible foundations for the social sciences, have not been very fruitful. One can also agree that not only the search for evolutionary 'laws' but equally any attempt at the construction of universal transhistorical generalisations will never be successful because - in as far as universal generalisations fail to take seriously into account the historical and cultural contexts of social pheno- mena - they are doomed to be either wrong or trivial. Even so, all the above need not necessarily lead to a root-and-branch rejection of all holistic approaches. For we should make a distinction between substantive generalisations and generalisations that are predominantly methodological y in the sense that their aim is less to tell us things we do not know about the social than to provide us with conceptual tools for asking interesting questions and preparing the ground for the empirical investigation of the social world. Keeping this distinction in mind, there is nothing wrong with building up holistic conceptual frameworks, with the help of which one can put questions about the construction, reproduction or transformation of social wholes in their entirety. To give an example from my own research: in my study of modern Greek</page><page sequence="11">THE POVERTY OF SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY 685 society (1978, 1986) I have tried to examine the way in which economic, political and social changes in late nineteenth-century Greece related to each other as well as to more global transformations on the international scale. I think that this is as legitimate a problem as a more restricted investigation that might focus, say, on the disciplinary practices of nineteenth-century Greek hospitals or prisons. Now, if examination of the first problem is indeed as legitimate and as useful as the second, then the methodological construction of a holistic framework which - without providing ready-made answers -helps me investigate global transformations in a theoretically interesting and, at the same time, empirically open-ended manner, is a perfectly acceptable and worthwhile exercise. Of course, there are some holistic methodologies (such as certain versions of Marxism) that automatically lead to closed substantive theories; and as such they do result in authoritarian dogma. But not all holistic conceptual frameworks are of this type. For instance, the flexible and extremely perceptive manner in which sociologically-oriented historians like Braudel, or historically-oriented social scientists like Barrington Moore, have used holistic conceptual tools has helped them produce theories that throw a great deal of light on the constitution and transformation of capitalist societies. Why should we totally reject such theories? And if we do, what is there to put in their place? Postmodernists have nothing to offer instead, and as long as this remains the case, their crude anti-holism is at best mere rhetorical posturing and at worst a serious obstacle to the painstaking task of studying the hierarchical aspects of social life, and of showing how micro encounters and games are systematically linked to meso and macro ones (and vice versa). De-Centering the Subject A second bÃªte noire of postmodernism is the tendency of conventional social theory to view the subject as the foundation of all analysis, or to explain social phenomena in terms of the projects and strategies of individual and collective actors. Contrary to various phenomenological approaches, post- modernism puts at the centre of analysis not the individual subject, but social practices that are, in a manner of speaking, disconnected from the actors who have generated them. This reflects the view that practices do not have any one specific creator, be it a class, an elite or an interest group (Foucault 1977, 1980). In other terms, for post-modernism, social arrangements have no overall author or ultimate goal. The social consists of systems of differences, and in that sense it lacks an overall coherence; it lacks a centre or a unifying will that could endow it with guidelines and overall objectives. So, if modern culture gave us the 'death of God', postmodernism gives us the 'death of Man', or rather the 'death of the subject' as this is conceived by phenomenology and the Kantian philosophy of consciousness.</page><page sequence="12">686 NICOS MOUZELIS Looking critically now at the de-centering of the subject notion, one can, of course, agree that actors' practices may have unintended consequences, and that social phenomena are often constructed in a non-conscious manner - i.e. in a manner which does not allow us to identify individual or collective constructors - all this is perfectly acceptable. Equally acceptable is the argu- ment that people's identities are, at least in part, the unintended result of a variety of practices operating in different social spheres. But all this should not make us ignore the non-passive, 'conscious' dimension of both individual and social development. Foucault, towards the end of his life, realised the one-sidedness of his conception of individual subjectivities as the passive product of micro technologies of power. In consequence, in the last two volumes of his History of Sexuality , he began to speak not only of 'practices of subjugation', but also of 'practices of freedom' -by which he meant intra-active practices of self-communication and self- construction (Bernauer and Rasmussen 1988). Unfortunately, Foucault did not extend this late emphasis on the relative autonomy of the subject to the level of collective action. Social practices have continued for him to be presented in a de-centered , 'subjectless' manner. In that respect, therefore, and despite Foucault's categoric denials, his thought is very close to the functionalist type of thinking to be found in Parsons' and Althusser's work. Because, in as far as actors cease to be viewed as the, at least, partial creators of their social world, there is no way of explaining social continuity or change other than by teleological references to social needs or hidden codes. As a result, by the notion of the de-centered subject, Foucault simply reintroduces by the back door the self-same teleologically-oriented explanations that he was so keen to throw out in the first place. Moreover, given the peripheralization of agency, Foucault has no ways of showing how practices of coercion/subjugation and/or practices of freedom vary in their complex articulation from one institutional situation to another. The absence of any concept of agency that might suggest wAo-questions, or questions about how economic, political, or cultural technologies are differ- entially controlled, means that there is no way of assessing the relative weight of practices (be they practices of freedom or unfreedom); or the way in which practices on the micro level (e.g. on that of a specific mental hospital) relate to practices on the macro level (e.g. policies on mental hospitals as imple- mented by the government); or the way in which struggles between interest groups can intentionally or unintentionally affect the articulation of practices on any specific level of analysis. To repeat once more, the only way to show how discourses articulate and form hierarchically structured wholes , or the only way to show how and why certain discourses are more powerful than others, is to put at the centre of analysis individual and collective actors. When one fails to do this, the social world is reduced to a non-hierarchical, flat place and as such it can neither be described nor explained properly.</page><page sequence="13">THE POVERTY OF SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY 687 The Rejection of the Notion of Representation and Empirical Reference Postmodernism rejects not only holistic theories, but is equally opposed to the notions of representation and empirical reference. It scorns the idea that social theory could or should, directly or indirectly, represent a social reality existing 'out there', a reality that is constituted and continues in time separately from, or irrespective of, theory. One way of understanding the background of this position is to recall Saussure's idea of the arbitrariness of the sign. Saussure argued that in order to comprehend a word, the relation between the word as physical sound (i.e. as signifier) and the word as concept (i.e. as signified) is less important than the relationship between the signifier and other signifiers within the context of specific linguistic rules. With Saussure, therefore, the focus moved from the empirical referent and the signified to the links existing between a signifier and other signifiers, and with the linguistic rules that regulate their differences. Derrida (1976), as is well known, took this process further still, and his emphasis on the signifier, or rather on the differences between signifiers, is so overwhelming that the signified and its empirical referent become peripheral or disappear altogether. Following this kind of logic, social reality consists of endless chains of signifiers, each specific signifier drawing its meaning from its synchronic and diachronic differences vis-Ã -vis other signifiers. This leads to the postmodern idea of society as language, as text, or rather a network of texts, whose only referents are other texts. In such a situation the meaning of each signifier or text is inherently unstable, since any solid anchorage to an empirical reality hors-texte becomes impossible. Starting from such a basis, social theorists influenced by Derrida's approach, like Laclau (1985, 1990) and Baudrillard (1970, 1972, 1981a, 1981b) have set out to 'deconstruct' any theory that either has holistic pretensions, or tries to describe and explain in 'representative' fashion the empirical reference we call social reality, and which sociologists naively consider to be 'out there', so to speak. For postmodernists there is nothing 'out there' for a social theory to describe or explain. There is no dualism or any kind of distance between theory and 'empirical reality' - since, in the first place, any social pheno- menon is a symbolic construction, that is to say a theoretical construction. Conventional social thought is the dupe of essentialism, of a naÃ¯ve faith in the material, extra-theoretical existence of social phenomena; in actual fact, both micro and macro phenomena are nothing more than symbolic constructions derived from the fact that social players, while trying to interact, incessantly build up theories about the others and about themselves. Looking now critically at the postmodernists' attack on 'representation', here too their analysis - although it does contain interesting elements - is so exaggerated as to be unacceptable. Their attack on the essentialism and</page><page sequence="14">688 NICOS MOUZELIS empiricism as found in certain versions of conventional social science is conducive to a relativism so extreme that it hinders rather than helps empirical research. The idea that social phenomena are symbolic con- structions (an idea not, of course, invented by postmodernism), and that in consequence there is nothing 'out there' for a sociological theory to reflect or represent, does not necessarily lead to relativism, or to the abolition of all distinctions between theory and its empirical referent. Even if there is no 'material' reference to help us decide the correctness of a theory, there is a reference of a symbolic type, which can be as empirical and determinate as any material reference. To be more specific: if one assumes that at the base of social phenomena are theories generated by lay persons in their attempt to communicate with each other, then sociological theories are simply second-order theoretical constructs - they are theories about theories (Giddens 1984:284, 374). This formulation leads neither to relativism nor to the postmodern nihilistic rejection of any idea of empirical reference. In the same way that con- ventional social scientists try to test their theories with reference to a 'material reality' out there, so a non-essentialist approach should try to corroborate empirically second-order theories by reference to first-order ones. The vocabulary has changed, but the basic logic is, and should remain, the same. Such a position is perfectly compatible with both the welcome critique of essentialism of postmodern social thinking, as well as with its equally welcome anti-empiricism. What it is important to stress here, however, is that neither anti-essentialism nor anti-empiricism need lead to relativism, and to the crude position adopted by some postmodernists that, since there are no foundations and nothing 'out there' for a theory to represent, any theoretical construct is as true as any other. De-Differentiation All the above suggest a fundamental contradiction in postmodernism: between its proclaimed anti-foundationalism and the foundationalist, dogmatic manner in which its proponents attack rival theories. In particular, if one looks carefully at the position of postmodernism vis-Ã -vis holistic theories, vis-Ã -vis the problem of representation, and vis-Ã -vis the notion of the subject, in all three cases its criticisms are so extreme that, in the end, they undermine the positive elements that are undeniably contained in their approach. In fact, what seems to be the Achilles heel of postmodern social theory is its lack of any attempt at signposting , any attempt at differentiating, at specifying under what conditions their generalisations hold true and under what conditions they do not. Such a discriminating, non-totalising attitude is in fact incongruent with the postmodern mood which, as I have said already, in contrast to modernism,</page><page sequence="15">THE POVERTY OF SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY 689 emphasises intellectual de-differentiation - that is, the abolition of the con- ventional boundaries within the social sciences, as well as between them and philosophy, literature, psychoanalysis and so on (Lash 1990). On this point too, postmodern social theory jumps from one extreme to another. It merely exchanges the undesirable situation of lack of com- munication between the social sciences, for the equally undesirable one, where the internal logic of each discipline is completely ignored. To be specific, there is little satisfaction with the present status quo, where the boundaries between economics, political science, sociology and anthropology have become solid blinkers preventing interdisciplinary studies of social phenomena. But such compartmentalisation will not be transcended by the facile and mindless abolition of the existing division of labour between disciplines. It can be overcome only by a painstaking process of theoretical labour, which must aim at building bridges between the various specialis- ations. Such a strategy does not abolish social-science boundaries: it simply aims at transforming them from impregnable fortresses to transmission belts facilitating interdisciplinary research. In fact, what is badly needed today are more systematic efforts towards the creation of a theoretical discourse that would be able to translate the language of one discipline into that of another. Such an interdisciplinary language would not only facilitate communication among the social-science disciplines, it would also make it possible to effectively incorporate into the social sciences insights achieved in philosophy, psychoanalysis or semiotics. Postmodernism, by completely side-stepping this difficult but necessary theoretical task, simply proposes the free and indiscriminate mixture of concepts and ideas derived from philosophy, literature, sociology, psycho- analysis, semiotics and elsewhere. This rejection of boundaries, in com- bination with the neglect of micro, meso and macro levels of analysis and of social hierarchies leads, quite predictably, to a hotch-potch that is neither good philosophy nor good literature, nor yet good sociology, psychoanalysis or semiotics. And it is precisely this free-for-all strategy of de-differentiation, and the abolition of distinctions and boundaries, that has led to the present incredible situation where anything goes, and where complex macro- phenomena are reductively explained in terms of signs, texts, the un- conscious, or what have you. As far as I am concerned, such crude exercises constitute a relapse to pre-Durkheimian attempts to explain social pheno- mena in terms of instincts, race, climate or geography. The only difference is that today postmodernists draw their reductive explanations from psycho- analysis and linguistics rather than from biology and geography. In these circumstances, it is not surprising that postmodern theorising is marked by a relativism which tries to persuade us that any theoretical construction, however bizarre or crude, is just as true or false as any other. It is also not surprising that postmodernist theory tends to adopt a style where the lack of depth and of substantive analysis is concealed beneath a</page><page sequence="16">690 NICOS MOUZELIS quasi-poetical language glorying in the obscure, the ambivalent, in plays on words and similar gimmicks. To conclude: the postmodern critique of conventional social theory has destroyed a number of myths and has, to some extent, forced social scientists into reconsidering some of their basic presuppositions. On the other hand, the postmodernist emphasis on theoretical de-differentiation, and on the more relativistic and nihilistic aspects of modern culture, unavoidably leads to a theoretical impasse that hinders rather than facilitates the advance of social knowledge. Conclusion I have argued in this essay that the postwar emergence of sociological theory as a separate sub-discipline has been an unavoidable as well as desirable effect of the growing division of labour within sociology. Early postwar sociological theory, as shaped by the writings of Parsons and his numerous disciples, did not manifest the unity of theory and empirical research that had been a characteristic of classical sociology. On the other hand, neither did it erect insurmountable barriers between theory and research, since its major aim was the elaboration of conceptual tools that were to facilitate, and prepared the ground for, the empirical investigation of substantive problem areas. This close connection between theory and research can be seen in the considerable volume of empirical investigations that were inspired by Parsonian functionalism. Parsonian theory, however, in its endeavour to provide an overall con- ceptual framework for the study of cultural, social and personality systems, overemphasised 'systemness' at the expense of agency on both the micro and macro levels of analysis. This fundamental flaw was partly overcome on the micro level of analysis by the spectacular development of the various interpretative sociologies. These, however, by identifying action/interaction with the micro level of analysis, and institutional structures with the macro level, were unable to link micro and macro approaches effectively, and to deal satisfactorily with the Parsonian underemphasis of macro actors. This lop- sidedness - which led to a systematic neglect of social hierarchies and to an ever widening rift between micro and macro sociology - was not corrected by relevant theoretical developments outside interpretative micro sociology, such as structuration theory, the theory of communicative action, or rational- choice analysis. The persistent failure to link micro with macro, and action with insti- tutional structure in post-Parsonian sociological theory has made it lose momentum, the main energies of theoretically-minded sociologists now being turned to epistemological issues, to debates in disciplines like linguistics, semiotics or psychoanalysis. This shift in focus, from sociological-theoretical to philosophical, linguistic/psychoanalytic issues has weakened the ties</page><page sequence="17">THE POVERTY OF SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY 691 between theory and empirical research. The underdevelopment or stagnation of sociological theory proper meant that it was not possible to effectively translate insights drawn from philosophy, or from theoretical developments in neighbouring disciplines, into conceptual tools that would facilitate rather than hinder empirical research on the constitution, reproduction and trans- formation of social systems, particularly societal ones. This, finally, led to a situation where the inherent paradigmatic pluralism of sociology has degenerated into an anarchical cacophony, a total lack of communication between warring theoretical schools; it has also led to a postmodernist abolition of such fundamental distinctions as micro/macro, agency /system, representing/represented, etc. This, in combination with the abolition of boundaries between disciplines and sub-disciplines, has led to a free-for-all situation where anything goes, and where the analysis of societies by means of various reductive explanations has regressed to pre-Durkheimian standards. As a conclusion, although this is a paper focusing on diagnosis rather than remedies,6 I would like to end by suggesting that one way out of the present malaise is to put back into the centre of our theoretical preoccupations some of the intellectual craftsmanship that the first generation of postwar socio- logical theorists developed. This would help especially with the urgent task of solving rather than ignoring or defining out of existence the agency/ institutional structure and the micro/macro issues - issues which Parsonian sociology raised but failed to resolve. What would facilitate this task is: an attitude which would - contra modernism - oppose any attempt to orient sociological theory towards foundationalist projects (such as the endless search for epistemological/ontological groundings or the construction of universal generalisations/laws); and, on the other hand, an attitude which would - contra postmodernism - respect the autonomous logic of sociological theory and the establishment on that basis of bridges with related disciplines and sub-disciplines. This, as I have already argued, does not mean that sociological theory should turn its back on philosophy, linguistics or semiotics. It simply means that it should relate with them from a position of autonomy rather than heteronomy and self-effacement. In other terms my plea is not for any particular philosophy of science or view of the social; rather what I am advocating is that whether one is interested in neo-realist epistemologies, rhetorical tropes, regimes of truth and what not, as socio- logists we should always strive to translate all the above into a set of conceptual tools which could show both how such tools relate to already established conceptual frameworks as well as to ongoing research agendas. Finally, in so far as sociological theory's main task, to repeat, is the elaboration of conceptual tools which can solve theoretical puzzles and facilitate empirical work - I think that, at the present moment, in addition to grand theoretical schemes Ã  la Parsons or Giddens, a more modest and limited 'Mertonian' approach can also be of great use. By the latter, I do not</page><page sequence="18">692 NICOS MOUZELIS so much have in mind Merton's 'middle-range' theories or his rather positivistic views of the social sciences; I mean more his elaboration of a small numbÃ¨r of inter-related concepts which dispel confusions and/or raise interesting questions on a specific problem area.7 Although I do not have the space to develop this crucial point, as recent outstanding examples of this type of 'tactical' rather than 'strategic' research oriented approach to theory, I would like to mention the work of Bourdieu on education and of Michael Mann on the historical development of power networks. In their empirical investigations, both sociologists have used a small number of interrelated conceptual tools which - without providing philosophical foundations or a fully worked out map of the social - have illuminated in novel ways key areas of social life. Notes 1. This paper is based on my Sociological Theory: What Went Wrong?, to be published by Routledge in 1994. 2. Whether or not one accepts the irreversibility of this trend (and this is a problem which goes beyond the scope of this paper) what is really objectionable is not the intellectual division of labour per se; it is rather the lack of communication, the non-existence of conceptual bridges between disciplines and subdisciplines or between theory and empirical research. 3. This does not mean, of course, that Parsons, or those influenced by him, never refer to macro actors in their empirical writings. It simply means that when they do so it is in spite of, not because of, their theoretical framework. 4. For a recent example of this position see the debates between Rawls (1987, 1988) and Fuchs (1988, 1989). For a critique of their positions see Mouzelis (1991b). 5. According to Piaget (1950: 210) there are two types of social whole. The one is formed from the aggregation of discrete interactions. The other 'no longer represents the algebraic sum of these interactions but a whole structure analogous to the psychological or physical gestalÅ¥ (my translation). See also Kitchener (1985). 6. For a focus on remedies see my forthcoming book Sociological Theory: What Went Wrong?, Part Two; and Mouzelis (1990, 1991a). 7. For instance, in his Social Theory and Social Structure , Merton offered us a small number of interrelated concepts (dysfunctions, latent functions, un- intended consequences, the distinction between motivational and functional analysis) which clearly allows one to distinguish legitimate and illegitimate (i.e. teleological) forms of functionalism. He also showed concretely how these concepts can be used in empirical research. Despite the innumerable attacks against functionalism, the debate has hardly moved beyond what he has established decades ago. To give an example, critics of functionalism reject the concept of functionalist requirements or needs as being inherently teleological and replace it by the more fashionable notion of 'conditions of existence' (Cutler et al. 1977). They argue that one should investigate not the functional requirements of a social institution but its conditions of existence. However once one rejects teleological func- tionalism, i.e. once one accepts the points made by Merton (1963) that it is methodologically illegitimate to transform functional requirements into causes,</page><page sequence="19">THE POVERTY OF SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY 693 functional requirements and conditions of existence are strictly interchangeable terms. It is not, therefore, surprising that even aprÃ¨s la lutte functionalism is alive and well (see Alexander 1985). References Alexander, J. et al. (eds.) 1987. The Micro-Macro Link.
