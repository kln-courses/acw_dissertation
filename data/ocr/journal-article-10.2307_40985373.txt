<plain_text><page sequence="1">Aesthetic Tension: The Text-Image Relationship in Heinrich Hoffmann's Struwwelpeter Ben Parrot University of Wisconsin-Madison 1. Introduction: The Inception and Development of Struwwelpeter In the Christmas season of 1844, the well-known Frankfurt physician Dr. Heinrich Hoffmann was anxious to purchase a suitable picture book as a present for his three-year-old son Carl. Disappointed by all of the books he could find, Hoffmann ultimately decided to create his own. Upon the urging of friends who had seen his work, Hoffmann published his book nearly a year later in October 1845.1 His work, at the time entitled "Lustige Geschichten und drollige Bilder," enjoyed instant success. Numerous new editions appeared rapidly; and while several of these new versions were expanded or revised, most were left unaltered. In response to the public's affection for the book's notorious antihero, its title was later changed to "Struwwelpeter." The text was translated into numerous languages, and the work became an international classic of the children's book canon. Hoffmann's Struwwelpeter2 remains be- loved today throughout the entire world as the most famous German children's book, even though the work is also often decried as overly violent and thus unsuitable for children.3 As I will show, the relationship between text and im- age in Hoffmann's work is a central factor in this polarized reception. Although subsequent editions of the book were expanded, all changes took place under the direction of Hoffmann himself. The current form of the book - the stories included, their sequence, and the form of the pictures - cor- responds to the second version of Struwwelpeter, which appeared for the first time in its entirety in 1847.4 On the first page of the book, a brief introduction promises many Christmas presents to well-behaved children - a historical ref- erence to the book's own origin as a Christmas gift. On the facing page, in stark contrast to these obedient children, stands the world-renowned Struwwelpeter with wild, unkempt hair and ungroomed fingernails. He is the archetype of all naughty children, many examples of whom are found in the following stories. With one exception,5 all of these stories depict the actions of children who violate the rules imposed upon them. These rules are occasionally stated explicitly in the text by an adult authority figure, but more often are simply Monatshefte, Vol. 102, No. 3, 2010 326 0026-9271/2010/0003/326 © 2010 by The Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System</page><page sequence="2">The Text-Image Relationship in H. Hoffmann's Struwwelpeter 327 implied as the accepted or recommended norms for safe, appropriate child behavior. All of the children are punished for their misdeeds, either directly by an adult authority figure or more frequently by the immediate 'natural' consequences of their own actions. The didactic lessons of the various stories essentially demand civil and safe behavior: to be pleasant and well-mannered, not to play with matches, not to suck one's thumb, and so on. In addition, "Die Geschichte von den schwarzen Buben" treats a far greater social problem: the mistreatment of outsiders. At the heart of each of the stories, then, is a behav- ioral lesson to be learned by the young reader. The reception of these lessons, as I will show, is dependent upon the reader's understanding of the text-image dynamic in Hoffmann's book. 2. Funny or Frightening? Two Interpretations of Struwwelpeter^ Text-Image Relationship The divergent reactions to Hoffmann's work among adult readers and literary critics differ primarily in their assessment of its appropriateness for young readers - which is moreover determined by adult perceptions of how children will themselves react to the book. Adult critics of the book who argue that the graphic images and horrific texts will frighten young readers will thus find Hoffmann's book to be fully unsuitable for children, while those who claim that children will be amused by the comical depictions of over-the-top stories will endorse it. To be sure, adults have played a central role in the success of Der Struwwelpeter, as any work of children's literature must appeal not only to children, but also to their parents, in order to enjoy popularity on the mar- ket. Likewise, it is adult critics of the book who have been most influential in establishing its notoriety. Although adults are thus responsible for the split re- ception of Hoffmann's book, the central point of the debate concerning Hoff- mann's work nevertheless remains its appropriateness for children. Hence, any analysis of Der Struwwelpeter that seeks to account for its ambivalent reception - including the following analysis - should maintain the primary perspective of Hoffmann's targeted young readership. As mentioned above, the reactions to Hoffmann's book fall primarily within two opposing camps, and the division is driven largely by different conceptions of the text-image relationship. The first argues that image and text reinforce each other by their literal depictions of naughty children who are punished in some way or another due to their own bad behavior - as de- termined by the accepted norms for appropriate child behavior. Proponents of this view typically criticize the book as unsuitable or even dangerous for children due to its graphic depictions of violent punishments. As a result of Konrad's disobedience, for example, the pitiable boy loses both of his thumbs, at which point the dripping blood is accentuated visually in the accompanying illustration (16).6 According to this view, image and text work in tandem to</page><page sequence="3">328 Ben Parrot manipulate the child reader's reactions by allegedly scaring him or her into accepting the moralistic lessons of the text. The heart of the work, then, can be termed 'education through agitation.' While few literary critics interpret Hoffmann's work so monolithically, scholars such as Eva-Maria Metcalf and Barbara Smith Chalou have acknowledged that the pictures in Struwwelpeter are likely terrifying for very young children - keeping in mind that Hoff- mann's original target readership was three- to six-year-olds - who are not yet mentally mature enough to realize that the stories and pictures are not exactly true to life.7 While this specific point is beyond debate, many adults in the public at large have sweepingly adopted the 'education through agitation' view and roundly attack Struwwelpeter as an antiquated tool for frightening children into obedience.8 Two of the more prominent representatives of this view are Sarita Vendetta9 and Bob Staake,10 American artists who have pro- vided their own new illustrations for Struwwelpeter. Their adaptations incor- porate terrifying elements and are generally in line with the 'education through agitation' approach. In contrast to the 'education through agitation' position, another view argues that the pictures in Struwwelpeter actually undermine the gravity of the violent stories: While the text describes terrible, tragic scenarios in a mor- alizing tone, the drawings present these same events in an utterly implau- sible, exaggerated way. On the final day before his death from starvation, for instance, Kaspar appears as a veritable stick figure (17). Bettina Hürlimann refers to such depictions with the term "symbolkräftige Überwirklichkeit."11 Rather than depicting reality in a true-to-life fashion, Struwwelpeter contains a series of fabulous, overstated, perhaps even absurd illustrations; and through them, Hürlimann continues, the child reader's sense of distress is substantially mitigated. The caricature-like exaggeration of the drawings shifts the overall effect of the book so that it comes across more as entertaining and preposter- ous than intimidating and didactic.12 One might term this the 'comedy through tragedy' approach. It is significant that each of these perspectives on Hoffmann's work func- tions on two different levels of interpretation. In both instances, an analysis of the relationship between the text and images (and the degree to which they conform to or diverge from each other) leads to a more general interpretation of the work's overall effect upon the child reader. Ultimately, this results in either an acceptance or a rejection of the entire work. Clearly, then, one's un- derstanding of the text-image relationship in Struwwelpeter is seminal in one's reception of the work as a whole. As it turns out, though, neither perspective can adequately account for the polarized reception of Struwwelpeter worldwide. Taken together, the two separate viewpoints could offer a more complete picture of the book's overall effect: The 'comedy through tragedy' approach could explain the international success of Struwwelpeter in spite of its gruesome stories, while the 'education</page><page sequence="4">The Text-Image Relationship in H. Hoffmann's Struwwelpeter 329 through agitation' approach would account for its simultaneous international criticism. Still, this polarity remains too simplistic in providing an interpre- tation of the work as a whole; it is only a synthesis of both approaches that enables an even more powerful analysis which proves equitable to the more complicated relationship between text and image in Hoffmann's book. 3. The Dialectical Position: A Synthesis of Two Opposing Viewpoints The coexistence of two highly divergent positions suggests a third approach: one that synthesizes the assumptions and conclusions of the first two. This new perspective acknowledges a certain conflict between the highly stylized illustrations and the verbal text of the grisly plots (just as the 'comedy through tragedy' interpretation emphasizes) as well as a gruesome and disturbing se- riousness in these same images (as the 'education through agitation' school of thought claims). While the images can and do function to enhance the im- pact of the moralizing stories, it is the occasional conflict between the two that reveals the deeper layers of the text-image dynamic in Hoffmann's work. The third point of view argues that this conflict, when analyzed with respect to the congruence which also exists between the rhymes and the drawings, yields a dialectic which both illustrates the dynamic interaction between the texts and the pictures and exposes the significance of the work as a union of text and image. From the antithesis of a moralizing, fear-instilling text and a series of exaggerated illustrations, a synthesis of conflicting reactions emerges - a syn- thesis of indignation and delight, of fear and laughter. This dialectic accommo- dates, as it were, two opposing inclinations of readers of all ages: On the one hand, one is shocked and disgusted by the terrifying Struwwelpeter stories; but on the other hand, one also often finds humor or delight - perhaps in spite of one's own better judgment - in the laughably depicted punishment scenarios. The success of the book is likely rooted in this very tension: It is significant that five different editions were released in the first year of publication and that twenty more came out over the following decade,13 and that the book contin- ues to sell very well today, in spite of its notoriety. The very fact that one can criticize the work and simultaneously enjoy it provides strong support for the dialectical analysis, since such an ambivalent interpretation would essentially complement and account for the polarized response of the readers themselves. One proponent of such a dialectical position - albeit only partially based on the relationship of images and texts - is Dieter Petzold, who argues that the ambivalent effect of Struwwelpeter leads to a psychically paradoxical reception on the part of child and adult reader alike, as he or she identifies with both trans- gressors and penalizing authorities. All of the children's wrongdoings are de- picted without explaining why the disobedient children fail to abide by the rules imposed upon them. The text does not pose this question, concludes Petzold,</page><page sequence="5">330 Ben Parrot because its young readers already know the answer: Mischief is fun. The reader thus identifies with the misfortunate antiheroes, insofar as their actions represent a wish common to many a child: liberation from the onus of societal norms. Precisely therein lies Hoffmann's trap for the reader: If one identi- fies with the transgressors, then one must accept their punishment for oneself as the unavoidable consequence - natural or social - of such misdeeds. The comical illustrations, moreover, seduce the reader to identify with the authori- ties doling out the punishment, even though one also already identifies with those being punished. This surprising paradox, argues Petzold, occurs on the level of the unconscious, a realm in which even contradictory reactions are simultaneously possible.14 Petzold's model serves as a useful framework within which to analyze Hoffmann's book as a reflection of the conflicting innate tendencies of humans to assert their defiant willfulness as individuals while simultaneously uphold- ing the rules of society. Jack Zipes provides a similar analysis in which he makes biographical reference to the author of Struwwelpeter himself, whose strict father raised him to become a respectable citizen and thereby fulfill his obligation to society at large.15 Small wonder, then, that Hoffmann later made his father's principles his own, as he himself wanted to raise his children - even in their earliest years - to become upstanding citizens. According to his own account of the book's origins in the Christmas season of 1844, he was trying to buy his son a picture book, "wie es für einen solchen kleinen Welt- bürger sich schicken mochte."16 Zipes argues that Hoffmann's work contains an ambivalence between two proclivities - namely, between the recognition of the necessity to obey societal norms and the active (if unconscious) pleasure in imaginative, defiant willfulness. Precisely because of this polarity, Hoff- mann's creation has become a world classic, since this internal conflict reso- nates in the mind of every reader - young and old alike.17 The following arguments provide an illustration of how these ideas man- ifest themselves in the text-image interactions of Hoffmann's work. While Petzold supports his claims with a few references to the text, he fails to un- dertake a thorough analysis of the interactions which are at play in the book. I will argue - and illustrate with specific examples - that it is precisely the dialectical interplay of text and image in which the conflicting tendencies both of Struwwelpeter as a whole and of the reader's psychological response to the depicted scenarios are staged and played out. The following analysis of the text-image relationship in Hoffmann's work will also attempt to reconcile the ambivalent reception of the book worldwide. 4. The Text-Image Dialectic in Two Struwwelpeter Stories Of Hoffmann's entire canon, two stories in particular are easily the most con- troversial: "Die Geschichte vom Daumenlutscher" and "Die gar traurige Ge-</page><page sequence="6">The Text-Image Relationship in H. Hoffmann's Struwwelpeter 331 schichte mit dem Feuerzeug." Because the children in these two tales suffer the most severe physical torment, the two stories have unleashed the harshest criticisms against the book - and consequently have also become the most famous. Not surprisingly, both stories serve as striking examples of the text- image dialectic in Hoffmann's work as a whole. In the first illustration of "Die Geschichte vom Daumenlutscher," the young boy faces the viewer with his thumbs conspicuously extended, while his mother - who is only seen from the rear - stands beside him, brandishing her index finger to emphasize her threat. While the author permits Konrad's mother to express her warning in her own voice (in contrast to Paulinchen's parents, who are already absent at the beginning of her tragic tale; see below), it is certainly significant that she nevertheless remains faceless. As the viewer never sees her face, the rule seems to be of anonymous origins - a circum- stance typical for many of the Struwwelpeter stories. For the most part, the rules are already in place at the beginning of each rhyme, without ever being justified or even articulated explicitly. The author thus depicts a distanced, anonymous lawgiver, rather than a nurturing, sympathetic mother. One of the most striking features of this story's illustrations is the bi- zarre series of faces which appear in the background. In the first scene when Heinrich Hoffmann, Der Struwwelpeter, oder Lustige Geschichten und drollige Bilder für Kinder von 3-6 Jahren. Frankfurt am Main: Rütten &amp; Löning, c.1910, 16</page><page sequence="7">332 Ben Parrot the mother is still at home, there are two fixed, observing faces embedded in the doorframe. Their presence is difficult to explain, for neither of them bears an intelligible expression which could be interpreted unambiguously. Perhaps they would simply suggest that Konrad is not altogether unsupervised even when his mother is out of the house: This topos of God's omnipresence and omniscience was not at all infrequent in the literature of Hoffmann's era, which was largely marked by Christian influences.18 As soon as the mother leaves, however, a new and more interesting face appears above on the double archway. When Konrad begins to suck his thumb, the face seems stern and threatening, as if it were condemning him - an ominous precursor of the gory judgment to come. This judgment arrives in the third illustration, which serves as the linch- pin of the entire story. This picture - quite possibly the most famous one in the entire book aside from that of Struwwelpeter himself - depicts the tailor met- ing out his judgment as he instantly leaps into the room and cuts off Konrad's thumbs with his disproportionately large scissors. The parallel text frighten- ingly describes Konrad's agony: Weh! jetzt geht es klipp und klapp mit der Scher die Daumen ab, mit der großen, scharfen Scher! Hei! da schreit der Konrad sehr. (16) The cautiously sympathetic tone of this passage for the suffering boy is fur- ther enhanced by the indirect description of this cruel scene. The tailor is not mentioned as an agent in the boy's mutilation, as the text opts instead for an impersonal description of the action. This circumlocution with its disjointed syntax indirectly underscores the sheer brutality of this scene by impersonally describing a very personal, very graphic act of violence; the attempt to down- play the cruelty simultaneously serves to recognize it. The cuteness of the verse and the soothing effect of the meter no doubt soften the impact of the atrocity represented; this is true not only for this instance, but also for other shocking passages. Nevertheless, the scene itself could certainly be characterized as terrifying and unsuitable for children. It is the exaggerated and comical depiction that induces even young read- ers to laugh without necessarily being unsettled or frightened. The tailor's motley, gaudy attire contradicts the gravity of the drastic sentence he ex- ecutes, and Konrad's highly stylized position with flailing arms and raised legs causes him to appear as if he were dancing. The position of the tailor is amplified further still as he literally leaps into the room with coattails flying, fixated on the target of his shears, heedless of his top hat as it falls behind him. The tool of punishment itself - the gigantic pair of scissors - is nearly as tall as Konrad, yet most ridiculous of all is that Konrad's blood begins to drip even before the first thumb has been cut off. As Könneker remarks,</page><page sequence="8">The Text-Image Relationship in H. Hoffmann 's Struwwelpeter 333 the text does not mention the blood at all; it simply appears, prematurely, in the picture.19 One could characterize this story, then, more as a comic strip than a seri- ous attempt at educating through agitating; yet the other illustrations show that the situation is more complicated. In the final scene, as the dejected, thumb- less boy stands weeping alone, the all-seeing face in the threshold above re- turns and is seen to be smiling sinisterly. The menacing shape of the eyebrows would suggest happiness at the boy's suffering - that is, the face delights not in Konrad's alleged redemption for society as a boy who has been taught a les- son, but rather in his mutilation. We thus have a very explicit moral embodied in an over-the-top tragicomical scenario, with sinister undertones potentially lurking in the background. "Die Geschichte vom Daumenlutscher" is quite likely the most contentious story in the entire work; it was even omitted alto- gether from the earliest American editions, as it was found to be too violent.20 In spite of this - or perhaps precisely because of this - it stands all the more at the very center of the Struwwelpeter book. Through its central position as the fifth of the nine full-fledged stories, as well as through its controversial plot, "Die Geschichte vom Daumenlutscher" has become the crux of the Struwwel- peter canon. Konrad's tale is at once notorious and beloved, the quintessence of the split reception of Hoffmann's work. The pitiable Paulinchen embodies a dialectic similar to that of Konrad and moreover enjoys the unique status as the sole female protagonist in any of the Struwwelpeter stories. Paulinchen's tale is preceded in the book by "Die Geschichte vom bösen Friederich," which for the most part takes place out- doors. In contrast to this, her narrative occurs exclusively within the confines of the home; her death is, so to speak, a solely domestic affair. Paulinchen's parents are already absent at the start of the story, "als sie nun durch das Zim- mer sprang / mit leichtem Mut und Sing und Sang" (6). Uncontrolled move- ment or activity is judged negatively elsewhere in the book and consequently punished (in the instances of Zappel-Philipp and Hanns Guck-in-die-Luft, for example); therefore, Hoffmann is hereby unmistakably characterizing Pau- linchen herself as reckless. Her decision to play with the matches is repre- sented as rash, for she undervalues their true function and implicit danger when she takes them to be pretty playthings. Two visual elements addition- ally contribute to Paulinchen's negative characterization: Her attire is much more fancily decorated than was customary at the time, and she also ignores her doll, a powerful symbol of appropriate feminine behavior.21 In the first picture, the girl is still holding the doll in her hand - albeit loosely and care- lessly - although she has already focused her attention away from her doll to the matchbox. At this point she drops it so that the toy remains visible in the background, while Paulinchen herself turns away from it, fixated upon the flar- ing fire. In the final two illustrations, the doll is nowhere to be seen. Paulinchen is thus portrayed negatively and eventually sentenced to death when - and</page><page sequence="9">334 Ben Parrot because - she neglects the demands of respectable feminine behavior custom- ary at that time. As the only female protagonist, Paulinchen bears a double responsibility: Not only must she always refrain from doing something forbid- den, but she must also conduct herself in a fashion befitting a well-mannered young girl. Paulinchen, however, is not completely alone in her house, although her parents are presently not at home: The two cats Minz and Maunz assume the role of authority figures in the parents' absence as they attempt to warn the poor girl against the danger of the matches.22 Unfortunately she fails to heed their admonitions and as a result of her actions, bursts into flames until only a small pile of ashes lies on the floor - next to her shoes, which astonishingly remain completely untouched by the fire. Paulinchen is the only character who is mourned by anyone, as detailed in the final stanza that accompanies the illustration: Und Minz und Maunz, die kleinen, die sitzen da und weinen: 'Miau! Mio! Miau! Mio! wo sind die armen Eltern? wo?' Und ihre Tränen fließen wie's Bächlein auf den Wiesen.

Frankfurt am Main: Rütten &amp; Löning, c. 1910, 7</page><page sequence="10">The Text-Image Relationship in H. Hoffmann 's Struwwelpeter 3 35 The text by itself presents a lamentable tale of self-destruction, yet due to the accompanying images the text acquires an ironic undertone that complicates the seemingly unequivocal message of the text. The reader is at first led by the text to identify with the girl as it meticulously describes her delight in the matches in a positive tone - a tone that may lead young readers to share the fictional delight unreservedly in their imagination, while adult readers will be able to foresee its ominous consequences, their identification likely split between Paulinchen's delight and their own anticipatory dismay: Das Hölzchen brennt gar hell und licht, das flackert lustig, knistert laut, grad wie ihr's auf dem Bilde schaut. Paulinchen aber freut sich sehr und sprang im Zimmer hin und her. (6) The author thus instructs the reader directly to inspect the picture more closely in order to see just how much Paulinchen takes pleasure in the burn- ing match. As soon as one assumes her perspective and begins to identify with the transgressor and her misdeeds, however, the author's trap has been sprung. As Petzold has concluded, the reader is thus forced to apply the poor girl's punishment to him- or herself, thereby ensuring the internalization of the intended lesson.23 The illustrations, however, work precisely against this moralizing lesson as their sequence presents an increasingly comical depiction of the poor girl's truly pitiable situation. The first three drawings fit relatively well with the text, without as it were offering a form of visual resistance against it. But the fourth picture changes everything, for suddenly the images contradict the ex- pectations raised by the text in the reader in a surprising manner. As Könneker has pointed out, the final sentence reads as if it were meant as hyperbole; one would scarcely expect a genuine river of tears. Yet this is precisely what the drawing portrays: The cats sit around the ashes weeping bitterly, as their tears form a stream encircling the deceased girl's pristine shoes.24 This utterly literal representation of the text complicates the overall interpretation, for the final picture destroys the seriousness of the young girl's death precisely by creating a faithful pictorial equivalent of the exaggerated text. The conflict between text and image develops, in other words, out of a 'hyper-fulfillment' of the text - that is, because the images defer too exactly and unexpectedly to the text in an illustration of the impossible. This conflict arises precisely because the anticipated divergence of text and image does not take place. The posture of the cats, which becomes increasingly anthropomorphic throughout the sequence of illustrations, also displays a 'conflict of agreement' as a way of further ironizing the story. Minz and Maunz are placed fully sym- metrically in all four pictures. In the first, they each sit with one raised paw and threateningly open mouths. After Paulinchen lights the match in the second</page><page sequence="11">336 Ben Parrot illustration, they lift both forepaws up and open their mouths even wider in order to intensify the severity of their warning, which is twice made explicit in the text: "Und Minz und Maunz, die Katzen, / erheben ihre Tatzen. / Sie drohen mit den Pfoten" (6). In the third drawing they sit fully upright, as no ac- tual cat is able to do; and in the final image, the anthropomorphization process is complete as the bereaved cats, equipped with handkerchiefs and adorned in bands of mourning, weep a genuine river of tears. The visual depiction of the cats thus consistently corresponds to the text quite literally. Even though the text itself becomes more and more outrageous, no difference in the degree of exaggeration develops between it and the illustrations. In order to meet the demands of the poem, the cats are drawn more and more as humans, which in the end confounds all expectations of irony. The ultimate effect of this 'conflict of agreement' is to make the story's plot at least partially ironic. The fact that Paulinchen's pink shoes remain com- pletely unsinged exaggerates the situation even further, for it belittles the grav- ity of her death. The message of the text is not entirely called into question or restricted; rather, the drawings give it an ironic tone. The story's moralizing character may not be altogether dismissed, though, since the first three images serve to characterize Paulinchen rather negatively. The text-image dialectic can thus be read as a disapproval of her actions mitigated by the fact that her death by flame is somewhat elided behind its ironic portrayal, thereby affecting the reader less dreadfully. It is necessary to acknowledge this di- alectic to arrive at a complete analysis of the representation and impact of Paulinchen's death. 5. Conclusion In addition to these two stories, a dialectical focus on the text-image interac- tion uncovers similar 'conflicts of agreement' in further contributions to the Struwwelpeter collection of tales. To mention just a few brief examples, the 'conflict of agreement' occurs in several instances, particularly when the text depicts animals as victorious figures over the naughty children. The dog that bites Friederich wins the boy's dinner as a reward: "Der Hund an Friedrichs Tischchen saß / wo er den großen Kuchen aß." (5) Much like Paulinchen's cats, the dog is fully anthropomorphized as he sits in a chair at the dinner table with a bib tied around his neck, which is clearly not what one would expect in the real world. A similar logic is at work in the visual representation of the fish that mock the drenched Hanns Guck-in-die-Luft: "Doch die Fischlein alle drei, [...]/ lachen, daß man's hören tut." (23) In the picture, they swim with wide-open, laughing mouths and even with expressive eyes, as if they were human onlookers. The 'conflict of agreement' is even more conspicuous in the case of Kaspar, who loses weight with astonishing speed: "Am vierten Tage endlich gar / der Kaspar wie ein Fädchen war." (17) Undoubtedly, even young</page><page sequence="12">The Text-Image Relationship in H. Hoffmann's Struwwelpeter 337 readers would normally interpret this statement as an extreme exaggeration, yet in the picture Kaspar appears quite clearly as an actual stick figure.25 Such 'conflicts of agreement,' therefore, can be shown to complicate individual stories within the overall work by partially conflating the relation- ships of consistency and conflict between text and image. The former is often found where the latter would be expected. This phenomenon underscores the dialectical relation of the book's two primary modes of signification, which offer a certain level of antithesis that can and indeed must be synthesized into a fuller interpretation. An analysis that uncovers the specifics of the text-image dialectic on the 'local' level of individual stories thus also serves to provide a more satisfactory interpretation of the entire work and its reception. It is evident, then, that the text-image relationship in Heinrich Hoff- mann's Struwwelpeter has its own unique dynamic. In this picture book, we find neither simple, understated illustrations of the text nor a disjointed juxta- position of text and image, but rather a lively dialogue between both. Some- times they support each other, while at other times they are in stark contrast to one another. As I have shown, these processes occasionally happen at the same time in 'conflicts of agreement' as the images subvert the text precisely by supporting it in exaggerated literalness. Thus the text-image dialectic is also a dialectic of support and subversion. Both processes contribute to the effect of the work as a whole; and only by this dialectical relationship can the ambivalent reputation of the work be explained, as such an analysis clarifies how it is possible to be at once thrilled and appalled by the book. Identification and alienation, fascination and repugnance - all of these are simultaneously possible responses to the world-famous Struwwelpeter, a work that explores and exploits the complex interplay of text and image. 1 Heinrich Hoffmann, Lebenserinnerungen (Frankfurt am Main: Insel, 1985), 138-41. 2 All references to the text are to the following version: Heinrich Hoffmann, Der Struw- welpeter, oder lustige Geschichten und drollige Bilder für Kinder von 3 bis 6 Jahren (Bindlach: Gondrom, 1998). All further references to Struwwelpeter will appear parenthetically in the text. 3 Support of Hoffmann's book as a moral-instilling instruction manual in a contemporary English-speaking context comes from its inclusion in William Bennett's 1993 best-selling an- thology The Book of Virtues, a collection of poems, stories, and folk tales intended to resurrect the moral education of American children. Bennett includes the translated "The Story of Augus- tus, Who Would Not Have Any Soup" in his section on self-discipline, adding the brief inscrip- tion "In which we see the inevitable result of not eating enough of the right stuff."

Conversely, evidence of the notoriety of Struwwelpeter comes from the so- called "junk opera" Shockheaded Peter, a play with cabaret-style musical adaptations of each Struwwelpeter story. Created in 1998 by the British group The Tiger Lillies, the show later toured throughout the United States and completed a stay in New York City in May of 2005. The critically-acclaimed show offers a harsh critique of books such as Hoffmann's in which, as Jack Zipes describes it in his book chapter on the play, "adults want to save the young from them- selves by destroying their curiosity and adventurous spirits."

Another disapproving nod to Hoffmann's book - this time with a vastly larger audience - can be found in a 2006 episode of the popular American television comedy series The Office. In this episode, which takes place on Take Your Daughter to Work Day, one employee tries to entertain his co-workers' children by reading from the English translation of "Die Geschichte vom Daumenlutscher," much to the dismay of both the children and his boss, who responds by saying: "What the hell are you reading to them?

Given that animals serve as admonitory or retributive figures in several of the other stories, the fate of the hunter corresponds to that of the children in the other stories; therefore, the hunter does not remain entirely beyond the thematic of the work as a whole. 6 Interestingly, there was actually more blood present in the drawings of the book's origi- nal manuscript, the one which served as a Christmas present for Hoffmann's son. Although Hoffmann does not explain the change in his correspondence, Wiedmann speculates that the manuscript was altered in order to make the picture book less frightening.

According to her publisher's introduction, the artist's desire was to illustrate a book which "celebrated the demise of children" and whose goal was "terrorizing children, and imaginatively delighting in it." Adam Parfey, Publisher's Note, Sarita Vendetta (Illus.), Struwwelpeter: Fearful Stories and Vile Pictures to Instruct Good Little Folks (Los Angeles: Feral House, 1999) n.p. Vendetta's illustrations are purposefully horrific and by no means are intended for children. Her Struwwelpeter appears nearly inhuman - disfigured, blemished, more ogre than boy - and her depiction of the "Daumenlutscher" story features an anguished, thumbless, yet very life-like toddler crying in a corner, his wounds gushing with blood. Clearly, her images enhance even further the terrorizing effects which the 'education through agitation' position sees in Hoffmann's work. 10 Published in 2006, Bob Staake's Struwwelpeter and Other Disturbing Yet Cautionary Tales contains digitally produced illustrations of Hoffmann's stories. In contrast to Vendetta's disturbing images, which bear no similarities to Hoffmann's original pictures, Staake's illustra- tions often mimic the designs and positioning of many of Hoffmann's drawings, yet do so in a more cartoonish style. His Struwwelpeter, for example, boasts bushy green hair and flaunts trou- sers with a conspicuously open zipper and a rat tucked inside, while the scissor-wielding tailor is unmistakably clown-like in appearance with bright red shocks of hair, orange skin, and a long carrot-like protuberance for a nose. Although Staake's illustrations differ starkly from those of Vendetta, his original motivation for the project appears to have been the same as hers: In an on- line interview, Staake explains that Hoffmann's book was well-known in his German- American family and describes it as "something Hitler could have written on mescaline," claiming further that "this was the German way of child-rearing; scare the crap out of your kids and let 'em know that if they don't eat all their peas, some weird looking clown will burst out from behind a curtain and slice their nose off with an ax."

Interestingly, however, they do not appear to have the same effect in Staake's work, as the rest of his illustra- tions are already so goofily cartoonish. In the first illustration for "The Story of Cruel Frederick," for example, Staake depicts a little feline soul ascending heavenward after Frederick kills the poor kitten and vividly portrays the shock and dismay in the eyes of a pitiable fly whose wings Frederick tears off. After such images, the final picture of the anthropomorphized dog enjoying Frederick's dinner at the table hardly has the same power as it does in Hoffmann's version, since it does not run counter to the style of the previous illustrations. While a more thorough compari- son of the two versions would certainly be in order, it suffices here to point out that the overall effect upon the reader is entirely different between the versions as a result of the difference in illustration style.</page></plain_text>
