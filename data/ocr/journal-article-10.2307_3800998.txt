<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Waterfowl Art of Maynard Reece. By Maynard Reece. Harry N. Abrams Inc., New York, N.Y. 1985. 179pp. $49.50 (cloth). Included are 113 num- bered pieces of artwork, of which 62 are oil paint- ings, 31 watercolors, 12 pencil drawings, and 8 stone lithographs (one colored). This compendium of old and new wildlife art is yet another effort by wildlife artists to capitalize on a receptive reproductions (print) market (and who can fault them?). The book is approximately 30 x 28 cm (12 x 111/4 inches), and like others of its kind is hinged on the short side to accommodate the plates. The boards are bound in tan cloth with an impressed title in gold across the front cover and along the spine. The paste-down and free end-sheets are white. The pages are of heavier stock than in most art books illustrating colored plates. In physical makeup the book is excellent (printed and bound in Japan). In particular, the color rendition is superb, down to the detail of brush strokes; even the texture of the canvas is evident where the base pigment was scratched to cut the overlaid color. The Contents lists, after the Introduction, sections on habitat; the seasons; waterfowl; swans; geese; ducks: surface-feeders; ducks: divers; and an Epilogue. These are followed by an Index of Waterfowl/Catalogue of Plates, which repeats the numbered plates in black and white miniature photographs arranged in alpha- betical order according to waterfowl common names. This may not please everyone, but I liked it. To open this book and find an introduction by Roger Tory Peterson came as no surprise. He has launched more than a few such efforts. Although the introduction is skillfully constructed, it provides very 762</page><page sequence="2">J. Wildl.

To say of the paintings that, "The detail became less important than the fall of light and shade ...," is to me very puzzling, since I agree 110% on the lack of detail in important back- ground but find his subjects often overburdened with detail, including the separation of barbs on the pri- maries, all in full focus. In addition, there is a limited use of reflected light and shade on the waterfowl depicted. When Reece wishes to create contrast between background and subject he also conjures up his own meteorological and atmospheric conditions. It is dif- ficult to see how a very dark leaden sky could reflect brilliant light on a distant shore and bright yellow vegetation in the immediate and near foreground (pl. 6, 29, and 92). When poetic (or artistic) license is overdone, the resulting art slides from exciting painting to pretty pictures. There are numerous cases where habitat and birds are not in consort. Habitats lack credible detail and would not, in my opinion, stand as good landscape painting (pl. 34, 69, and 98) if the ducks were eliminated. There are a few ex- ceptions, as in plates 72 and 96. I was left with the distinct impression that the skies and water, the bread- and-butter of waterfowl art, were not convincing; therefore, the well-painted ducks appeared to be pasted on rather than painted into the scene (pl. 10, 29, 31, 35, and 51). Tree bark in most paintings lacks the texture to make trees real. Wing specula are sometimes overpainted (pl. 69). I dread assessing the text-it should have been written by a skilled writer (e.g., John Madson) to give it style and greater intellectual muscle. There is very little that is new or exciting, and the colloquial treat- ment adds nothing. Throughout he uses the personal pronoun you in attempting to put the reader in touch with his descriptive narrative. For example (p. 94): "Flights of ducks jump from the ponds and streak off through the first rays of light; you can hear geese honking above you, ahead of you and even behind you. Sensing that you have arrived in a feeding area, you look more closely at the ground A little of the "you" treatment might wash, but it goes on and on; finally (p. 105) the reader learns that you is autobiographical. "Wood duck drakes have colorful plumage" (p. 120); "You have to see Goldeneyes to identify them" (p. 154); "They (diving ducks) seem to enjoy com- panionship ..." (p. 27), and Canada goose goslings "... cannot fly until they have been well instructed in the art of flying" (p. 84). These are a few of the less profound, anthropomorphic or peculiar state- ments in a very anemic text. Perhaps the most pe- culiar are 2 references to waterfowl sending "scouts" to reconnoiter for weather conditions or for food: "If a sudden blizzard makes them slide back south for a week, they [ducks] will send scouts ahead to check the weather before traveling north again" (p. 39); and "White-fronted geese send out scouts in the late afternoon to select a feeding site for the next morning ..." (p. 98). I thought that the above old hunters' notions were discarded along with the belief that swallows hibernated in the mud of ponds. One wonders why the Snow goose morphs are re- corded (correctly) as 1 species, whereas the Tundra swan is still referred to as a Whistling swan. This artist is a very good waterfowl portrait paint- er, and that is the reason why he has been successful in waterfowl stamp competition. If he had developed as much skill with backgrounds as he has with por- traiture, the results would be outstanding. He keeps referring to marsh vegetation as "weeds"-so no wonder it is difficult to identify plants from most of the paintings; therefore, marsh vegetation qualifies as nondescript "weeds." He is a better master of color in watercolor than in oil. I thought his stone lithographs were excellent (pl. 50). He is, perhaps, best as a painter of geese although the white parts of Canada geese are often too white. Some of his pencil drawings are very good-I liked plates 51, 66, and 82. Two decorative china plates on which waterfowl were illustrated are well done, as are several paintings that appear to be unsuccessful entries in waterfowl stamp competition (pl. 89, 97, 99, 100, and 103). I feel that much of the weakness in this book rests with the editors, in the main for apparently not seek- ing help in reviewing the text. Reece's skillful por- traiture is often lost or out of place in drab or listless background, sky or water. I would not have used the mallard painting as a dust jacket illustration (with the hen mallard with its swan-like neck). Plate 51 of Canada geese would have been a better choice. If you are interested in waterfowl art, this book is a mixed bag and is not a good investment, but not a bad one either.-Robert A. McCabe, Dep. Wildl. Ecol., Univ.
