London and New Haven: Yale University Press, 1995, xvi + 368 pp. UK£ 3250(Hb); UK£ 12.00(Pb) International Journal for Philosophy of Religion 41: 184-186, 1997. In this volume collecting his Gifford Lectures on Natural Theology, Jaroslav Pelikan examines the influential synthesis of Greek philosopy and Christian orthodoxy realized in the polemical and dogmatic theologies of the Cappadocian Church Fathers - Gregory of Nazianzus, Gregory of Nyssa, and Basil of Caesarea - and in the teachings of Macrina the Younger, sister to Basil and Nyssen. The New Testament, as Pelikan reminds us, 'happens to have been written in Greek', and, like Origen before them, the Cappadocians struggled to interpret and systematize a revealed truth which, by virtue of its means of conveyance in 'the language of Classical and Hellenistic philosophy and science', had arrived carrying a great deal of theoretical baggage. Terms central to the vocabulary of Christian theology - logos, for instance, hypostasis, ousia, pneuma, arche, apatheia, apocatastasis, even theos - were established technical terms in various Greek systems of natural philosophy and metaphysics when, in the 4th century AD, Basil and the two Gregorys undertook to fix the meanings of these terms in the context of scriptural exegesis and the authoritative elaboration of Christian doctrine. Pelikan argues that Cappadocian thought is of continuing importance not only because its substance became orthodoxy, but also because Cappadocian strategy in negotiating the mutual accommodation of Greek philosophy and Christian belief became the standard working methodology of rationalist theologians until the time of the Enlightenment. Subsequently, that venerable strategy, along with the particulars of the Greco-Christian orthodoxy it generated, came under increasing critical scrutiny, raising anew ancient questions concerning whether and to what extent Christianity may make legitimate use of a natural theology rooted in the secular rational- ism of the Greek schools. Pelikan insists, and rightly, that it is impossible to take a 'responsible' position on such questions without first investigating the Cappadocians' original and nuanced solution to the problem of Hellenic influence. In this engrossing study, Pelikan undertakes just that task, providing an in-depth, parallel exposition of Cappadocian natural theology: first, as a framework of philosophical and theological presuppositions within which to deploy Christian apologetics; and, second, as the superstructure of doctri- nal orthodoxy. The book is divided into two halves, each devoted to an ordered treatment of topics in Cappadocian natural theology under one of its two aspects. The order of topics within each half of the book emphasizes</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 185 the systematic unity of Cappadocian thought - this systematicity being one deliberate product of their theological labors - and the order of topics is the same in both parts, allowing the reader to compare the polemical treat- ment of each issue with its resolution in orthodox Cappadocian dogmatics. This comparison also serves to illustrate what Pelikan terms 'the meta- morphosis of natural theology' in Cappadocian thought - the transforma- tion of critical speculation into constructive dogmatic. The Cappadocians learned the apologetic uses of natural theology from the Greeks, who had critiqued the anthropomorphic polytheism of Hellenic myth and practice by measuring popular ideas of the divine against 'the logic of theism' devel- oped in the Greek schools. Using what Gregory of Nyssa called 'the univer- sal confession about the nature of the divine' - that god is demonstrably perfect in being and goodness - the Cappadocians argued against polythe- ism by turning secular philosophy back upon secular culture and belief. The atheistic opponent, by contrast, was confronted with the manifestations of divine providence in the order and working of the cosmos, for, as Basil the Great said, it is 'by the sight of visible and empirical realities' that the unbe- lieving mind may be 'led, as by a hand, to the contemplation of invisible realities'. Against Christian heretics, the enemies within, Cappadocian strategy was more complex. When the occasion demanded it, the Cappadocians used the Hellenic logic of theism to argue the patent falsity of a given heresy on the grounds that it asserted, in Nyssen's phrase, something 'impossible by the nature of things'. However, the Cappadocians were equally willing to accuse philosophically sophisticated heretics of abandoning genuine Christian teaching in favor of the false glamour of an alien understanding, and of 'using philosophical inquiry', in the words of Gregory of Nazianzus, 'to destroy the credibility of the Spirit'. Pelikan makes clear, however, that the Cappadocians' dual assault on heresy was backed up by a double defense of orthodoxy - on the twin bases of conformity to natural reason and fidelity to Holy Scripture and Christian tradition. The difficulty of simultaneously fortifying orthodoxy on both fronts accounts for the variety and ferocity of theological controversy in the 4th century, which in turn explains the determination of the Church Fathers to construct a stable and authoritative doctrine. Pelikan stresses that the Cappadocian commitment to negative or apophatic theology played a crucial role in mediating their successful syn- thesis of philosophical speculation and authentic Christian teaching. By denying that God's nature was in any way knowable, save as a transcendent and compelling ineffability, the Cappadocians were able to protect some of the peculiar dogmas of the faith - notably those associated with trinitarian- ism and orthodox Christology - from excessive and destructive philosoph-</page><page sequence="3">186 BOOK REVIEWS ical meddling. Natural theology, they argued, affirms God's perfect transcendence, and in so doing, forbids speculation regarding the divine nature; only 'the foes of truth', Gregory of Nyssa admonished, 'rush in upon the ineffable'. Cappadocian theology, by constrast, conformed to what Pelikan indentifies as 'the universal rule of apophasis\ to wit, 'that the intention of all language about God was to describe not the essence of God, but the conditions under which God could be thought of as existing'. Apophatic theology and its 'lexicon of transcendence' allowed the Cappadocians to integrate the paradoxical elements of Christian belief into an elaborate rationalist dogmatic; Pelikan maps the intimate structure of that dogmatic in chapters richly embroidered with scholarly and theological detail. This is fascinating material, both as intellectual history and as philo- sophical theology - though readers not familiar with the intricacies of doc- trinal controvery in the infant Church may find it necessary to do background research along the way. Pelikan's scrupulous exposition of the subtleties of Cappadocian natural theology is inevitably dense, but the text is embellished throughout with the eloquent, arresting words of the Cappadocians themselves. In Christianity and Classical Culture, the four Cappadocians emerge, ultimately, not only as brilliant champions of Christian orthodoxy, but also as ardent heroes in the more ancient and uni- versal struggle to achieve, in a phrase borrowed from Gregory of Nyssa, 'some sort of transformation of human nature into something more divine'.
