<plain_text><page sequence="1">Photodynamic Notes, 1X. By Pliny Earle Chase, LL.D. (Read before the American PhilosophicaZ Society, April 18, 1884.) 411. -,Ethereal Oscillation. Some readers of the Photodynamic Notes have found a difficulty in ap- plying the laws of pendulum oscillation to the undulations of the luminifer- ous aether. It is well to guard against the conception of material pendu- lums, hung in or across the solar system, but it is also well to remember that the modern theories of molecular motion explain the rigidity of steel, and of all other solids, by the rapidity of motion, in ultimate discrete par- ticles. If this view is correct, all changes in molecular movement are probably transmitted in and througlh the same elastic medium as the un- dulations of light, and all oscillations are in some way dependent on aethe- real oscillations. 412. Illustrations of Nodal Tendency. The well-known experiments of placing bits of paper on vibrating strings, sprinkling sand on Chladni plates, depositing fine powders in transparent musical tubes, and eliciting musical notes from glass vessels which are partly filled witlh water, illustrate the tendency of all vibrations to drive material particles towards musical nodes. These nodes are sub- ject to the same laws of inertia which determine centres of oscillation in ordinary pendulums. The nodal tendency is greatest where the relative elasticity and the consequent undulatory velocity are greatest. As we know of no other medium in which the ratio of elasticity to density is so great as in the luminiferous aether, we can reasonably look in no other direction for such striking evidences of rlhythmic influence as are to be found in cosmical and molecular arrangements. 413. AEthereal Rotation. The supposed properties of the luminiferous tether are so similar, in many respects, to those of ordinary gases, that we may suppose it to act and react on all grosser forms and aggregations of matter. The rotations and revolutions of suns, planets and satellites are not only in lharmony</page><page sequence="2">1884.] 591 [Chase. withl aethercal undulations, but they are also, as we may reasonably pre- sume, produced by them. If cosmical rotation is dependent, in any way, upon methereal waves, the reaction of cosmical inertia should produce a tendency to aethereal rotation. 414. Extent of Rotating Influence. It is not unreasonable to suppose that the tendency to aethereal rotation at stellar centres, may be felt at a distance which is at least as great as the modulus of light. That distance in our system is very nearly equivalent to seventy-four times Neptune's mean radius vector. Although the rigidity in a rotating aetlhereal splhere may seeni to be of a very different character from the rigidity of metallic rods and cosmiiical globes, it must evidently be ac- companied by similar tendencies towards gravitating and oscillatory centres. 415. Kinetic Postulates. All modern researches which have been guided by the theory of uni- versal kinetic correlation seem to justify the following postulates: 1. An all-pervading, elastic aethereal medium, the particles of which are subject to gravitating attraction. 2. Consequent cyclic, rhythmic and harmonic tendencies of various kinds. 3. Probable frequency of simple forms of harmony, which are governed by centres of oscillation. 4. Mutual and equal action and reaction between centripetal gravitation and centrifugal radiation. 5. Radiating as well as projectile velocities, which are measured by the sum of cyclical resistances. 6. Correlation and mutual convertibility of light, heat, electricity, gravi- tation, etc. 7. Tendency of harmonic approximations to become numerically exact, as demonstrated by Laplace in discussing the motions and orbital periods of Jupiter's satellites. 416. Importance of Reciprocals. In some text-books on arithmetic, a few lines are given to the explanation of reciprocals, and the statement is sometimes added, that the reciprocals of an arithmetical progression constitute a harmonic progression. Few, except those who devote themselves to a thorough scientific study of music, ever get any further knowledge of a subject which is full of interest, and wllich is likely to become of great importance in the future annals of scientific research. In his pamphlet on " Electrical Units of Measure- ment," Sir William Thomson enlarges upon the want of a unit of con- ductivity to represent "the reciprocal of the resistances." He says: "It is the conductivity that you want to measure, but the idea is too puzzling; and yet, for some cases, the conductivity system is immensely superior in accuracy and convenience to that by adding resistances in series."

Electricity is the form of force which is now, for many practical reasons, commanding general attention ; but its need of a more satisfactory and sys- tematic study of reciprocal and harmonic activities is no greater than we can find in many other fields of physical research. Ohm's law brings all electrical phenomena so directly within the realm of resistance that Max- well was inclined to regard electro-dynamics as more fundamental than thermo dynamics. A full consideration of the subject would require a knowledge of mathematical principles which are somewhat intricate. There are many facts, however, which are so simple and intelligible that they may be easily learned, and a knowledge of them may awaken an in- terest which will facilitate investigation in every possible field. 418. Spheral Music. We have all heard of the "music of the spheres ;" how many of us understand the literal truth of the stateinent: "There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st, But in his motion like an angel sings." The music of the spheres, as well as the music of the human voice, or of stringed or brazen instruments, is due to elasticity, which makes suc- cessive vibrations follow regular laws, so as to produce rhythmical and pleasing results. The beats of pendulums are governed by some of these harmonic laws and may be represented by harmonic formulas. The lumi- niferous tether, which is supposed to pervade all planetary and insterstel- lar spaces, and which Newton suggested as the possible storehouse of gravitation, should, on account of its enormous elasticity, furnish endless illustrations of faultless rhythm. 419. Con.frmation of the Hypothesis. We find, in accordance with the foregoing note, that the resistance of the sun to the interstellar vibrations of light produces a series of twenty- seven musical nodes, within the region in which solar attraction predomi- nates over the attraction of the stars. Nine of the nodes are between Mercury and the Sun; nine are at points which account for the positions of the eight primary planets and of the asteroidal belt; and nine are be- tween Neptune and the nearest of the fixed stars. The middle node of the middle nine, or the fourteenth node of the twenty-seven, is in the as- teroidal belt. These facts, which have been already given in previous notes, are repeated in this connection as indicative of the probability that the aethereal rotation extends much further than was intimated in Note 414, and as giving the most stupendous evidence which has ever been pub- lished of the nodal tendencies to which reference is made in Note 411.</page><page sequence="4">1884.] 593 [Chase. 420. Revelation. The foundation of all knowledge is revelation, which is always self-evi- dent and infallible. The inspiration of the Almighty giveth understand- ing. All that we have and all that we are come from Him. In the interpre- tations of revelationi, we are left in some measure to ourselves. While the self-evidence is given to us, we combine, in various ways, premises which we accept on account of their self-evidence or supposed self-evidence; in that combination we are liable to mistakes and fallacies of judgment. All truth is God's, all error is man's. They therefore make a fatal mistake who would set up the decisions of fallible judgment against the revelations which are offered for the acceptance of their own faith, or those which have been clearly apprehended through the faith of others, in truths which have been made self-evident to them. 421. Fallacy of Agnosticism. We have no right to question the assertion of any individual that he does not know God. Neither has any one a right to say that God is un- knowable. Receptivity, power, and knowledge, are the three funda- mental axioms of all science and of all truth. So far as either of them is finite it is dependent upon something superior to itself. The agnostic, who recognizes a Supreme Power and who fails also to recognize a Supreme Receptivity and a Supreme Wisdom, has but a partial view. If in his teachings he implies, in any way, that human receptivity or human wis- dom can be superior to any other receptivity or wisdom, he is guilty of arrogance and cannot shield himself under any assumption of humility. The only power of which we have any practical knowledge, is that of will; and will itself is always directed by purpose. So far as man, through the exercise of his purpose, his will and his intelligence, controls the powers of nature, he is imitating the Supreme control. Although it is true that we cannot "find out the Almighty unto perfection," and although it is also true that we should avoid any narrow anthropomorph- ism, there is no doubt that the purpose, the will, and the wisdom of man differ from those of the Almighty, not in kind, but only in degree, and that in these respects man has been created in the image of his Maker. 422. The Oxygen Unit. Marignac (Ann. de Chim. et de Phys., March, 1884), in his late re-exami- nation of some of the atomic weights, conisiders that Prout's law is only approximate, and that, since the numbers which express tho atomic weights only represent ratios, there is no reason for taking the hydrogen unit in preference to 16 or 100; but the choice of 16 is justified by its practical advantage. It allows us to represent the atomic weights of the greatest number of elements, and especially of those which are most important, by the most simple possible integers and with the least difference from the rigorous results of experiment. The fact that the atomic weights exhibit</page><page sequence="5">Chase.] 594 [April 18, more exact ratios to tlle oxygen than to the hydrogen unit, appears to have been first pointed out in No. 138 of the foregoing notes. 423. UniversaZ Rotation. The hypothesis that every material particle is endowed with rotation, by which it represents a definite amount of living force, has often been broached. Its probability is strengthened by the magnetic theories* of Arago, Ampe're, Barlow, Lecount, Challis, Babbage, Herschel, Christie, Maxwell, Imray, Forbes and others; by mny own investigations confirma- tory of the hypothesis that " there can be no weight without some degree of momentum ;"t by the connection of magnetism with rotation in a magnetic field through Laplace's principle of periodicity (note 333); and by the evidences wllich are furnished, by notes 413 and 419, of interstellar aethereal rotation, producing nodes wlich are determined by stellar inoduli of light. According to tllis hypothesis no material particle can be wholly divested of energy, and no particle can ever acquire energy enough to free it from the equilibrating tendencies which spring from the law of equal action and reaction. 424. Nascent Nebular Rotation. The beginning of the transfer of rotation from oethereal particles to cos- mical masses, is illustrated by the equivalence of ratios between masses and rupturing distances, in the two ruling globes of the solar system. Taking Bessel's estimate of the mass-ratio of Sun to Jupiter (1047.879), the vector-radii of the two bodies, when in static equilibrium with regard to their common centre of gravity, should be in the same ratio. The pro- jectile energy, which changed the static into an oscillatory dynamic equi- librium, has produced a secular eccentricity, according to Stockwell, of .0608274, the secular perihelion being, therefore, .9391726 of Jupiter's mean radius vector. Dividing the static ratio of vector radii, 1047.879, by .9391726, we get 1115.7469 X Sun's semi-diameter for Jupiter's mean radius vector. Dividing this value by 5.202798, we get 214.4513 for Earth's mean radius vector, which represents a mean solar apparent semi-diameter of 961 ".8254. The British Nautical Almanac estimate is 961".83. 425. Nascent Resistance. Laplace's principle of periodicity, and incipient "subsidence," according to Herschel's modification of the nebular hypothesis, are both exemplified in the equation: (1 - e) g5t5 vg0 ?'O in which e Jupiter's secular eccentricity; go, g5 = gravitating accelera- tion at the equatorial surface of Sun and Jupiter, respectively; t6 = time * Cited in Proc.

The incipient subsidence of Jupiter, as indicated by the factor (1 - e) g5, co6perates with solar attraction in the formation of a belt of maximum condensation. Accordingly, the second planetary mass, in regard to the simplicity of harmonic relations, is Earth, which occupies the centre of the dense belt. Its distance from the Sun and its mass may be found by means of the equation ~/ (1 - e) g5 r, = (pr * P g3 3 The mean radius vector is designated by p, Jupiter and Earth being in- dicated by subscript s and 3 respectively.

The formation of a belt of maximum condensation, by the action and re- action of subsidence and rotation between the two principal masses of the system, establishes the conditions which are requisite for nodal harmonies of various kinds. One of the simplest harmonic series is r etc. The cen- tre of linear oscillation adds its influence to the natural rhythmic tenden- cies of the second of these nodes. Both the moment of rotary inertia of a thin spherical shell and the nodes of aggregating collision in condensing nebu]ae* also introduce the factor 2, and the moment of a rotating ssthereal or other homogeneous sphere introduces the factor W. Moments of inertia vary as distances of projection against uniform resistance ; we may, ac- cordingly, look for the frequent recurrence of the factors 2 and i, ia the harmonic rupturing nodes of condensing and rotating nebulae, especially in the neighborlhood of the most important centres of condensation. *Proc. Am. Phil. Soc., xvil, 99.</page><page sequence="7">Chase.] 596 (April 18, 428. The Sun-Earth Balance. The situation of Earth's orbit, between the orbit of Jupiter and the Sun, introduces tendencies to condensation and rotation of the character referred to in the foregoing note. The action and reaction of aethereal waves, between the principal centres of attraction and of condensation, have produced an amount of gravitation, at the earth's equatorial surface, whlich is sufficient to give a circular orbital velocity of v'gr = 4.90743 miles per second. The linear oscillation of the Earth around the Sun, as well as the centre of rotary inertia for a superficial film of condensation or of luminous undulation in the orbit of Mars, multiplies this energy by 2; the rotary aethereal oscillation of a sphere wllich has its limit in the asteroidal belt also multiplies the energy by i. Accordingly, if the Earth's orbit was always circular, its velocity of revolution, as thus determined, would be X - x 4.90743 _ 18.40286 miles per second. There are 31558149 seconds in a year, thvrefore the Sun's distance should be, if Earth's orbit were always circular, 18.40286 X 31558149 * 2 r = 92430800 miles. This is probably correct within less than 1 of one per cent. (See Note 434.) 429. Accuracy of flarmonic Method. The above method of estimating the Sun's distance is the shortest which has ever been published. I believe that it is also the most accurate if proper allowance is made for orbital eccentricity, for the following rea- sons: 1. If the hypothesis of an all pervading luminiferous aether is true, all its cyclical movements must be rhythmic, or harmonic, the various forms of rhythmn being governed by various centres of oscillation. 2. The simplest kinds of oscillatory motion, in cosmical bodies, are linear and spherical. 3. Laplace showed, in discussing the motions of Jupiter's satellites, that whenever there are tendencies to simple numerical relations, in planetary arrangements, all the forces of the system combine to make those tenden- cies exact. 4. The Sun is tlle principal centre of attraction, and the Earth is the principal centre of condensation in the solar system. 430. Rhythmic Weight of the Sun. The Sun can be weighed by its musical rhytllm with a corresponding facility. Orbital velocities vary inversely as the square root of the dis- tance from the centre of gravity. Any two attracting bodies bear the same ratio to each other as the distances at which they would communi- cate equal orbital velocities, to particles which revolve about the centre of gravity of the attracting bodies. Hence we have: Earth's Radius Vector. Earth's Radius. 92430800 X ( X 3)2: 3962.8 328002: 1.</page><page sequence="8">1884.] 597 [Chase. In other words the Sun would weigh 328002 times as much as the Earth, if Earth's orbit were always circular.* The remarkable accordances among the various harmonic estimates which are deduced from the corre- lations of mechanical, electrical, chemical, luminous and other forces, in- dicate an amount of probable error which is much smaller than those of ordi- nary astronomical estimates. 431. Lunar AIas8. F&amp;r-t E8timate. Ferrel (Methods and Results, p. 20) gives 7989 metres as the height of the homogeneous atmosphere. The equilibrium of atmospheric elasticity, between the mutual interactions of Earth and Moon (Notes 8, 316), gives the following proportion: (20000000 -.- ): 7989:: r3 : .0012549r3:: (z2 X 80.74) : 1 432. Lunar Mass. Second Estimate. The estimates of the height of a homogeneous atmosphere differ for different latitudes and for slight variations in the elements of the calcula- tion. It may, therefore, be more satisfactory to deduce the Moon's mass from the simple principles of oscillation. From Notes 8, 162, 246, we find: t g 12 32.08776 _ t g ( )= 5280 X (43082.04)2 112 1142874 miles for the length of Earth's theoretical pendulum. From this equation we deduce the ratio of Earth's mass (in8) to Moon's mass (ai), by the propor- tion p3: a m: : ,. 92524100 : 1142874:: 80.957 : 1 433. Earth's Secular Eccentricity. The harmonic relations of the Earth and Moon are still further shown by the evidences of original terrestrial projection before the Moon sepa- rated from the Earth. If we designate Earth's secular perihelion radius vector by p'3' we have the proportion, g. rO (?% + a) : (g8 t,)2 M8 : : P8 : P'8. In other words, the orbital vis viva of original solar projection, for the combined masses of Earth and Moon, is represented by the mean radius vector, while the limitingf oscillatory vis viva of the Earth alone is repre- sented by the radius vector of secular perihelion. Substituting in the above proportion the harmonic values which we have already found, we have 269.7662 X 81.957 : 261.81942 X 80.957 : : 1 :.930462 this gives, for Earth's secular eccentricity, .069538. Stockwell's estimate of this eccentricity for the value of Earth's mass which we have deduced from its harmonic oscillation is .06901.

Correctio. for Secular Eccentricity. In Note 428, Sun's distance was estimated upon the hypothesis that Eartli's orbit was circular. The mean distance, however, may be con- sidered as having been established at the time of original rupturing pro- jection, or, in other wordls, at secular perihelion. The circumference of an ellipse is 2 X a I - e2 e 2.3 e24-12.32 e6, etc.) 22 2242 2.426 Substituting the theoretical value e = .06954, this becomes 2 X a X 99879. The corresponding value of Earth's mean radius vector is 92430800 * .99879 - 92542790, which differs by less than I of one per cent, from the value which was deduced in Note 426, from the incipient subsidence of Jupiter. The corresponding value of m. m3 is 329196. 435. TIin Planet8. Action and reaction, in a system which is fundamentally dependent upon two largely preponderating bodies, may naturally lead to a grouping in pairs. Laplace's modification of the nebular hypothesis, which supposes that the first ruptures are in the form of rings or belts, and Herschel's hy- pothesis of subsidence until the acquired velocity becomes rupturing, also favor the simultaneous formation of companion perihelion and aphelion planets. Accordingly, we find two supra-asteroidal groups, Neptune- Uranus, Jupiter-Saturn, and two infra-asteroidal, Mars-Mercury, Earth- Venus. The grouping in the belt of greatest condensation indicates a double tendency; Earth-Venus representing influences which appear to have orignated in the Sun, while Mars-Mercury seem to be more specially referable to activities at the centre of condensation, than to those at the centre of nucleation. 436. Mass Relation of Jupiter and Saturn. The discovery, by Prof. Stephen Alexander, that the masses of Jupiter and Saturn are nearly in the inverse ratio of the squares of their mean vector-radii, was the first step towards a demonstration of the fundamental principles of harmonic astronomy. This ratio represents the moments of aethereal or nebular rotary inertia for the two planets, respectively. The closeness of the approximation is shown by the proportion 5.2027982 9.538522:: 104.879 3522.3. Hall's estimate of Sun by Saturn is 3482; Bessel's 3501.6; Lever- rier's 3512. The greatest difference between either of these estimates and Alexander's approximation is only about 11 per cent, the least difference is less than i of one per cent. I know of no other mass-approximations which rest upon purely rhythmical laws, except my own.</page><page sequence="10">1884.] 599 [Chase. 437. Mass- Relation of Earth and Venus. The simplicity of the harmonic mass-relations between Sun and Earth, as well as between Jupiter and Saturn, increases the likelihood of similar relations, which are equally simple, between Earth and Venus; but the wide range of discrepancy among the estimates of different astronomers makes it somewhat difficult to ascertain what rhythmic influence has prevailed. Stockwell's estimate of Venus's mass is about .945 of Earth's mass; Hill's is only .831 ; Leverrier's mean of two estimates, .872. The value which would give Earth and Venus equal orbital momenta is .85049. We may, therefore, claim a great probability for the proportion, mO: m3 ::(329196 .85049 = 387066): 1. 438. Mass-Relation of Neptune and Uranus. In the exterior twin planet belt, we find a harmonic mass relation which is no less striking than those that have already been given. It is es- pecially interesting, as pointing to an early stage of nebular condensation, as well as to a blending of external and internal influences which accounts for retrograde satellite rotation and revolution. The gravitating accelera- tions, which are due to the actions and reactions between two cosmical masses, are proportioned to the respective masses. The vis viva of gravi- tating subsidence is, therefore, proportioned to the cube of the masses. We find, accordingly, that m83: M f3 l P8 p7' In this proportion p8. represents the locus of incipient subsidence, or secular aphelion of Neptune, while pT represents the mean radius vector of Uranus. The values, which satisfy this proportion are very exact, as will be seen by the following comparison: Harmonic. Newoomb. Sun Neptune 19372.86 19380 ? 70 Sun Uranus 22603.33 22600 - 100 439.

It was shown in Note 428 that Earth's mass may be harmonically de- duced from Sun's mass through its limiting value of circular orbital ve- locity. Neptune's mass may be deduced from Earth's through the cor- responding limit of orbital time. We have, accordingly, m8: M3 ta:t: 16.98: 1. In this proportion ta = 27r z t; = a sidereal day. 441. Earth's Oblateness. The importance of Earth's position, at the centre of the belt of greatest condensation, is further shown by the fact that its centrifugal force of daily rotation, by which it is harmonically connected with Neptune, has also determined its oblateness. For we find that (ta t,)2 = 288.4. Listing's estimate (See Note 249) is 288.5. 442. Linkage of Earth and Uranus. Another interesting connection between the dense belt and the outer twin-planet belt, is shown by the proportion, 365.2565: 338.2183:: pst p6. In this proportion, 338.2183 is the distance, measured in Earth's semi- diameters, at which a satellite particle would revolve in a solar year; )6t is the secular aplhelion distance of Uranus, while 06 iS its mean distance. This relation is also interesting because the aphelion of the 33.25 year me- teoric belt is in the orbit of Uranus, and because a ray of light would tra- verse the same meteoric orbit in the time of one solar rotation. The pro- portion gives, for the secular aphelion of Uranus, 1.07994. Stockwell's estimate is 1.07797. 443. Another Linkage of Earth and Jupiter. In notes 425 and 426, the gravitating accelerations of Earth and Jupiter were shown to be harmonically related to each other, as well as to the gravitating acceleration of the Sun. The moon furnishes another har- monic link, which is shown by the equation 60.2778 X 5.202798 X 1047.879 = 328629. In this equation 60.2778 is von Littrow's estimate of Moon's mean dis- tance in equatorial semidiameters of the Earth; 5.202798 is Jupiter's mean distance, in Earth's mean vector radii; 1047.879 is the quotient of Sun's mass by Jupiter's mass; 328629 is, within less than T of one per cent, the harmonic quotient of Sun's mass by Earth's mass. 444. Thte Meteoric Thleory of WVorld Building. Proctor (North American Review, May, 1884) criticises the theory of Olbers, which has been lately advocated by Herbert Spencer, and consid- ers that the asteroidal belt has been formed by meteoric influence, in con- nection witlh the attraction of Jupiter, rather than by the explosion of any primnitive planet. In many of the foregoing notes there has been evidence</page><page sequence="12">1884.] 601 [Chase. of influences which may be regarded as meteoric. Indeed, Herschel's subsidence-theory recognizes the continual activity of such influences, provided we consider every particle which is falling towards the sun as meteoric. If we still further regard the luminiferous tether as material, we may consider ourselves as living in a condensing and rotating nebula. 445. Linkage of Sun, Earth, Jupiter and Saturn. The influence of simple primitive subsidence, which was so strikingly exemplified in the mass-ratios of Neptune and Uranus (Note 438), is no less evident in the four important cosmical bodies which represent, re- spectively, the chief centre of nucleation (Sun), the chief centre of con- densation (Earth), the primitive nebular centre (Jupiter), and the centre of inertia of the primitive planetary system (Saturn). This influence is shown by the equation Sun X Earth X Saturn = Jupiter'. Substituting in this equation the harmonic ratio of Sun to Earth (329196) and Bessel's estimate of Sun -.- Saturn (3501.6), we get for Sun . Jupi- ter 1048.5. 446. Saturn's Secular Eccentricity. The mutual actions and reactions, among the four cosmical masses which were introduced into the foregoing note, are still further shown by the connection of the orbital periods of Earth and Jupiter with the secular eccentricity of Saturn. Tllis connection is shown by the proportion 4332.5848: 365.2565 1 :.0843045. Stockwell's estimate of Saturn's secular eccentricity is .0843289. This diflers by less than I1 of one per cent from the harmoniic estimate. 447. Primitive PhyUlotactic Relations. The centre of a nebula which is bounded at opposite extremities of its diameter by the secular aphelia, or loci of incipient subsidence, of Nep- tune and Uranus, according to Stockwell's estimate, is 4.8952. This differs by less than ; of one per cent from Jupiter's secular perihelion, or locus of incipient nebular rupture. The mass of Neptune is approximately 3 of Earth's harmonic mas3. Uranus is almost precisely 6 of the Uranus- Neptune belt. Saturn is almost precisely 3T of the Jupiter-Saturn belt. The~ numbers ~, 2 X 1, 2 and J- are all phyllotactic.

Soc., xxi, 266) in discussing the gaps and clusters of the Asteroidal belt, says: "In three portions of the ring tlle clustering tendency is distinctly evident. These are from 2.35 to 2.46, from 2.55 to 2.80, and from 3.05 to 3.22; containing forty-three, ninety- six and forty asteroids, respectively. We have thus an obvious resem- blance to the rings of Saturn; tlle partial breaks or chasms in the zone corresponding to the well known intervals in the system of secondary rings." He accounts for the gaps by the periodic harmonic perturbations of Jupiter, but he gives no explanation of the clustering tendency. If we take 6, 1, and - of Jupiter's mean distance, we have 2.401, 2.601, 3.252. The numbers 2 x 3, 3, and A are all phyllotactic. The first of the clusters, 6 , seems to indicate a harmonic connection with the primi- tive rupture of the Uranus-Neptune belt which was pointed out in the foregoing note. 449. Constant of Aberration. Magnus Nyr6n has published, in the Memoirs of the St. Petersburg Academy, a valuable paper on the determination of thle constant of aber- ration. A summary of his results is given by A. M. W. Downing, in The Observatory, vi, 365. The value which has long been accepted by astronomers is 20".445. Struve discussed the possible sources of error, some years after the publication of hlis memoir, and adopted the value 20".463. Ny]6en deduces, from three different sets of observations at Pulkowa, 20"'.492 -4- 0".006, which Downing thinks "must be an ex- tremely accurate value of this important constant, and will probably have to be considered final until it can be corrected by an equally accurate and extensive series of determinations made in the southern hemisphere. Such a determination is, at the present time, a desideratum in astronomy." 450. Succession of Harmonic Mass Influences. According to the foregoing notes, the first harmonic influence in the determination of relative planetary masses seems to have been that of simple subsidence, represented by the cubes of masses. Next was the simple product of mass by distance, representing the beginning of the change from static to rotary equilibrium. Then came the product of mass bv the square of the distance, representing nebular rotary inertia. This was followed by the quotient of mass by the square root of distance, rep- resenting simple orbital momentum. These relations seem so natural and so important that it may be well to give the calculations in detail, for future reference, and also to extend those calculations to the most import- ant linkages which have been indicated among the different planetary and satellite belts. 451. Simple Suibsidence. There are three planetary illustrations of the determination of mass by simple stubsidence: 1.

The equations represent various obvious radial and tangential actions and reactions. Equation (1), when applied at the Sun's surface, which is the point of greatest gravitating acceleration in the solar system, gives g t = VA. This satisfies Ohm's: law, as applied to solar rotation in a mag- netic field, Fourier's theorem, Laplace's principle of periodicity, and the projectile velocity which balances athereal resistance at Sun's surface. rfhe actions and reactions of centripetal gravitation and centrifugal radia- tion are thus co6rdinated in such ways as to give simple forms of expression for all kinetic correlations. Equations (4) and (r5) represent similar tan- gential tendencies to belt formation by the vis viva of primitive tangential motion, both at the outer limits of the solar system and at the outer limits of tlle belt of greatest condensation. Equation (2) represents a harmonic relation of tangential velocities, at the chief nucleal centre and at the chief centre of condensation. This equation satisfies Laplace's demon- stration of the tendency to exactness in simple numerical relations. It also satisfies various tendencies of subsidence as well as of linear and of rotary inertia. Equation (9) gives harmonic tangential velocities to the two interior companion masses, in the belt of greatest condensation. Equations (6), (7) and (8) represent radial and belt-rupturing tendencies of simple subsidence. In the mutual interactions of gravitating subsi- dence the sums of the gravitating accelerations, along mutually connect- mg2 ing lines, vary as the respective masses; therefore 2, or the vis viva of subsidence, varies as m3. Equation (3) represents harmonic interactions between the centre of primitive subsidence (M8) and the chief centre of condensation (m.,). The importance of these interactions is still further exemplified by the fact that (t,, -- ta)2 = Earth's oblateness according to Listing's estimate (Note 440). Thiis accordance seems calculated to tlhrow great doubt upon Delaunay's hypothesis of retardation by the "tidal brake. " 462. Deduced Values.

The outer portion of the Neptune-Uranus belt is harmonically connected with the belt of greatest condensation, as we have seen (Note 440), by an important mass-relation. One linkage of the inner portion of the same belt was given in Note 442; another is found in the proportion ta: tp :: (p3 + 2po)2 : p72. 1: 366.2565 : : (1.00233155)2 : (19.18244)2 Leverrier's estimate of p4 is 19.18264, which differs from the harmonic estimate by less than 4 of Sun's semi-diameter. This harmony introduces: (1) The rupturing tendencies of nebular subsidence through Jr; (2) The interstellar parabolic influences which have determined the harmonic po- sitions of the eight primary planets and of the asteroidal belt (Note 46); (3) The conversion of parabolic into elliptical influence, with foci at the centres of Earth and Sun; (4) The variation of the times of nebular rota- tion inversely as the square of radius. These relations, taken in connec- tion with equation A, Note 460, furnish conclusive evidence in support of Herschel's ' subsidence theory. " 464. Earth's Dependence on Luminous Undulation. The influence of luminous undulation in determining Earth's orbital period is quite as remarkable as its influence upon the time of solar rota- tion. The latter represents the maximum energy, while terrestrial revolu- tion represents the mean energy of luminous undulation, in accordance with the general principle that, when a disturbance consists of terms in- volving sines or cosines of angles which vary with the time, the maximum energy is twice the mean energy. According to Stockwell, the secular centre of the belt of greatest condensation is at 1.01693944039 which is an arithmetical mean between Earth's mean radius vector and its mean aphelion. Earth, like Jupiter, shows the energy of amthereal projection as well as the mean energy of luminous undulation. We find, accordingly, g3 X 1 year - 1.0338788v.. This gives vA = 185501.5 miles. 465.

The varied harmonies which have been pointed out between the Nep- tune-Uranus belt and the dense belt, may riaturally lead us to seek for some additional evidence of luminous influence at the outer limit of the solar system. Such evidence is furnished by the proportion: Pa :P, Py 3- In this proportion pa Neptune's secular aphelion + Earth's mean aphelion; p = = Neptune's secular aphelion; p) - centre of belt of greatest condensation. Substituting Stockwell's apsidal elements and the harmonic value of P., the proportion gives v. = 185492 miles. The ex- treme range of discrepancy in the three estimates (Notes 464-6) is less than TyT of one per cent, or less than ten miles per second. 467. fairmonic Estimate of the Constant of Aberration. Earth's mean orbital velocity is 1296000" * 31558149 = 0".041067; VA 185497.2 miles, if we take the mean of the three foregoing estimates. To find the coustant of aberration we have the proportion: 185497.2: 92542800 1 sec.: 498.89 see. 0".041067 X 498.89 20".488. The close accordance of this value with Nyr6n's estimate (Note 449), furnishes satisfactory confirmation both of the accuracy of Stockwell's cal- culations and of the precision of the harmonic estimate. 468. " V." The foregoing results abundantly show that the principle of harmonic motion is of "immense use not only in ordinary kinetics, but in the theories of sound, light, heat, etc." * Analogy, the law of parsimony, the theories of kinetic correlation, and the various principles enumerated in Note 461, all point to the value of V A, which is given in the foregoing note, as equivalent to the ratio " V" between the electrostatic and electro- magnetic units of electricity, electric current, magnetic potential, electric displacement, surface density, magnetic force, and strength of current at a point. The corresponding resistance in the field of rotation is 29.853 Ohm's. This agrees very closely with Foucault's estinmate, 29.836 Ohm's. Weber's estimate t was 31.074; Thomson's t 28.2; Maxwell's t 28.8; Michelson's ? 29.982.

An additional linkage of Sun, Earth, Jupiter and Neptunie is shown by the proportion: L : f)3.2 : P8.2' In this proportion P2 P82 represent secular perihelion of Earth and Neptune, respectively. Substituting Stockwell's value of P3.2 gives P8.2 29.685p3. Stockwell's estimate is 29.73p8. 469. Another Linkage of Jupiter and Earth. Let va- vis viva of circular orbital revolution which Jupiter, when at mean aphelion, would be able to give to a particle at the centre of the solar system = m52 P a; V3 = molecular vis viva which Earth would be able to communicate to the same particle = (m32 . p) ; VA = Ve- locity of light; V3 = circular orbital velocity of a particle at the chief centre of condensation in the solar system (Earth). Then we find va: v3:: VX : V3. Substituting the harmonic values of Earth's mass and of the constant of aberration, with Stockwell's estimate Pa *3 = 5.427351, we find vA v3 = 10067.61 ; M5 - 3 = 313.61; mO-M5 = 1049.69, which differs by less than A of one per cent from the value which was deduced in Note 462. This relation shows that, when nebular subsidence and luminous undulation had established incipient orbital motion around the Sun at Jupiter's mean aphelion, the actions and reactions among nucleal centres established the molecular motion, at the chief centre of density, which resulted in Earth's orbital oscillation. The first indication of the importance of the factor 9 appears to have been given by me (Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc. xii, 394). Maxwell subsequently adopted it (P. Mag., June and Sept., 1877, pp. 453, 209) without leaving any record of the source fromn whiclh he derived it, or of the reasons upon which it was based;, In all of my investigations my first inquiry is, what obvious radial or tangential velocity, momentum, or vis viva is there, which would be likely to operate in producing or maintaining such exactness of cyclical harmony as is necessary for the stability of the system. The first trial usually gives some clue which suggests the next. These alternations, between Baconian observation and the "scientific use of the imagination," have been rewarded by frequent confirmations of predictions which I lhad haz- arded and recorded weeks, montlhs, or years, before they could be sus- tained by any known data. 470.

For the influence of p3 + upon the orbital locus of Uranus, see Note 463. 471. Sun's Equatorial Acceleration. The luminous projection of Jupiter and of the centre of the dense belt, as well as the other evidences of apsidal influence upon planetary harmornies, show that molecular vi8 viva has slightly modified the simple undulatory vis viva of the luminiferous wther. The amount of the solar equatorial acceleration is not precisely known, because no Sun-spots have been ob- served very near the solar equator; it cannot, however, differ much from Earth's mean secular eccentricity. We may, therefore, regard this as another evidence of the harmonic importance of "subsidence"'' to the belt of greatest density.</page></plain_text>
