<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW OF SOCIAL ECONOMY Natural Images in Economics: A Review Essay Warren J. Samuels, Jouni Paavola Michigan State University Abstract An extended review of Philip Mirowski's edited collection, Natural Images in Economic Thought. Examines the roles of metaphors; the relationships between metaphors of the "natural" and the "social"; the significance of metaphoric reasoning for economics, with regard to questions of meaning, ontology and epistemology; the discursive, or rhetorical, nature of economic theory; and significant historical and interpretive issues pertinent to economic thought. Keywords: nature, naturalism, metaphor, postmodernism, rhetoric Economics began its course as a self-conscious discipline in the eighteenth century and its history, to some extent at least, reflects its origins. The discipline commenced with the perception of the (political) economy qua economy, as something apart from the rest of society. The economy was also conceptualized as in part the product of the superimposition of the natural order of the universe in the moral realm, in part the domain of natural economic laws, in part a product of human social construction, and, inter alia, in part an abstract conceptual moral order transcendent unto itself (see Myers 1983). At least party for this reason, natural metaphors have been both ubiquitous and diversely comprehended in the discipline throughout its history. Adam Smith, for example, arguably displayed numerous meanings of nature (Puro 1992) and had his analytical feet planted in several paradigms: supernaturalism, naturalism, and secular empiri? cism. Naturalism itself?and the eighteenth century was newly the age of naturalism?took different forms. The state of nature could refer to some primitive situation to which civilization was favorably contrasted, or it could signify the natural in opposition to the artificially contrived. Review of Social Economy Vol LIV No. 3 Fall 1996 ISSN 0034-6764 ? 1996 The Association for Social Economics</page><page sequence="2">REVIEW OF SOCIAL ECONOMY For some, nature was in juxtaposition to humankind; for others, humankind was part of the natural order of things. For some writers, naturalism was simply the prevailing mode of discourse, whereas for others it constituted an ontological schema, a definition of reality itself. Economics has never escaped the human tendency to posit an order transcendent to human action. The neoclassical mainstream has consti? tuted the economy as a set of pure markets issuing forth a set of prereconciled and unique determinate optimal equilibrium solutions. Marxism has constituted the economy as driven by certain laws of motion and internal contradiction. Both have given effect to the idea of a transcendent pure economy dominating the proximate and even perverse domain of human action. This tendency has been driven by supernaturalism, naturalism, and ideological construction and manip? ulation of an idealized system, and these in turn driven by the individual and collective needs of psychic balm, social control and power play. The perceptions of "natural," "social," and "artificial" have always been selective, projective and political. Nothing could be more "natural" than one's own social arrangements and to consider their conceptual idealization as constituting the natural order of things. People living under feudalism, post-feudal pre-capitalism, mercantil? ism, capitalism, mixed economies, latifundia systems, socialism, and so on, have accepted their social arrangements as more or less "natural." People are socialized from childhood to accept the situation in which they are born, internalizing that in which they have been inculcated and treating it as "natural." These processes of socialization and naturaliza? tion have been facilitated by politics operating, inter alia, in and through more or less deliberatively manufactured public opinion and selectively reinforcing elements of those arrangements. Into this mixture of nondeliberative idealization and deliberative manipulation also have entered two other interacting ingredients: the idea of unintended consequences emphasizing the lack of predictable deliber? ative control, and a growing policy consciousness undermining the social construction of a reality open for revision. However, all these "natural" tendencies have had to coexist with and operate within the perceptions of the "natural." In the eighteenth century, when economics commenced as a discipline (as well as today), considerations of meaning and of truth were tied up with varying metaphysical, epistemological, ideological, commonsensical, instru? mental, and, inter alia, experiential tenets. Experimental sciences that 342</page><page sequence="3">NATURAL IMAGES IN ECONOMICS arose from the seedbed of naturalism have not wholly escaped from these tenets. Economics, among the social sciences, was profoundly and perhaps inextricably influenced by them, though in ways both subtle and as yet largely unexplored. One of the deepest and most provocative research programs in the history of economic thought in this area has been that of Philip Mirowski. In a series of publications, especially Mirowski (1989), he has explored the origins of the neoclassical paradigm in borrowings from the nineteenth-century physics, a physics now largely passe. In the volume presently under review (Mirowski 1992; all page references not otherwise attributed are to this volume), Mirowski has brought his intellect and power of persuasion to produce, as the result of a September 1991 conference at the University of Notre Dame, a collection of penetrating and suggestive essays. Also present is Mirowski's trenchant wit, which produced the subtitle, after Tenny? son's "Nature, red in tooth and claw" (In Memoriam, 18-50, lvi.4) and other examples (pp. 456,458,464,465, and 470). As will be seen, the collection is wide ranging, variegated and not readily summarized or evaluated. It contains valuable materials and analyses pertinent to the role and putative status of borrowed figures of speech in economics and in the history of economics itself. Moreover, each essay in the volume contributes in an important manner to an overall analysis of metaphor. Section I of this review surveys the contents of the volume, emphasizing major substantive and metaphor-related themes, making a few evaluative comments. Section II presents certain overall conclu? sions distilled from the volume and arguably helpful to historians of economic thought. Section III presents some concluding comments. The reader should be aware that the authors are by no means experts in several of the substantive areas dealt with in the contributions. This review article, it should also be clear, concentrates on Mirowski's project?the use of metaphor?and not the history of economic thought per se. I. REVIEW OF THE ARGUMENTS The twenty essays of Natural Images are presented in five sections. The first section sets the course of studying natural and other metaphors in economics for the volume. The next three sections examine some of the 343</page><page sequence="4">REVIEW OF SOCIAL ECONOMY metaphors economics has borrowed from physical and biological sciences and how economics in turn has provided useful metaphors for other sciences (most notably for biological sciences). The last section examines the social construction and the politics of the natural and metaphors in general. The most interesting and poignant issues of each section will be addressed below in this order, article by article. The Natural and the Social The introductory section contains two essays on metaphors in econom? ics. The first, Mirowski's "Doing What Comes Naturally," presents the use of metaphors (of nature) as something we engage in naturally and from which we cannot escape. For him, we work out, not discover, the meaning of "natural" and "social," and economics is a prime locus of this working out, in the form of particular images of the natural in the constitution of economic theories and the discipline of economics as a whole. Mirowski identifies four metanarratives that depict the relations of the natural and the social operative in economics and in the history of economic thought. First, the natural and the social may be perceived as identical in one or other respect. Second, the natural and the social can be understood to be disjunct but individually law-like in some respects. Third, the natural can be conceived of as objectively stable while the social patterned on it is perceived to be unstable. Fourth and finally, the natural and the social can both be understood as unstable, jointly constructed and mutually supportive. Mirowski considers that the concept of metaphor has facilitated the working together of the representatives of the four metanarratives in this volume, and that the volume has been able to give them more equal voice than has been customary in the history of economic thought. Mirowski identifies himself as the representative of the fourth metanarrative along with Donna Haraway, Bruno Latour, Friedrich Nietzche and Michel Foucault. When reflecting upon the various conceptions of the relations of the natural and the social embodied in these metanarratives, he observes that they all contain valuable dimensions. In his important constructivist synthesis of these meta? narratives he observes that Using Natural metaphors in theories of Society fosters reassuring and graphically concrete images of order, situating humanity squarely at 344</page><page sequence="5">NATURAL IMAGES IN ECONOMICS home in "its" universe, while the parallel projection of social concepts onto Nature render what might otherwise be an unintelligible alien world comprehensible and accessible to human desires and purposes.1 The identity resides in the process, and not in any especially stable character of Nature or Society. (P. 14) In Chapter 2, Arjo Klamer and Thomas C. Leonard affirm the ubiquity and necessity of metaphors in economics and in all science. They argue that metaphors have a heuristic and cognitive, and not merely a decorative, function. According to them, metaphors channel imagination in charting the unknown and are heavily context depend? ent: metaphors are more than pieces of language, they are a "process of thought" (p. 30, quoting Donald Schon). Still, according to the authors, not all metaphors are indispensable. Klamer and Leonard identify, in addition to decorative or poetic metaphors, three other types: pedagogical, which illuminate and clarify; heuristic, which facilitate understanding and new ideas; and constitutive, which frame discourse or demarcate paradigms at the most fundamental level. Their discussion of heuristic metaphors underlines both the importance of analysis and argument by analogy and the implication that models?so prevalent in economics?are but useful fictions, a mode of discourse, and not compatible with the positivist account of truth (pp. 36, 43). The authors also observe that mainstream economics has difficulties in accepting this view due to its mechanistic constitutive metaphor, because to conceive of economics as a discursive practice based on a handful of metaphors would be subversive for such a worldview because it threatens to emphasize rhetorical tools at the expense of fact and logic, a mechanistic world's mean of inquiry. (P 43) 1 The argument is evocative of Shackle (1967: 286, 288): "All we can seek is consistency, coherence, order. The question for the scientist is what thought-scheme will best provide him with a sense of that order and coherence, a sense of some permanence, repetitiveness and universality in the structure or texture of the scheme of things, a sense of even that one-ness and simplicity which, if he can assure himself of its presence, will carry consistency and order to their highest expression. Religion, science and art have all of them this aim in common. The difference between them lies in the different emphases in their modes of search_The chief service rendered by a theory is the setting of minds at rest." 345</page><page sequence="6">REVIEW OF SOCIAL ECONOMY Physical Metaphors and Mathematical Formalization Part II contains four essays, only three of which actually deal with mathematics. In his penetrating essay, I. Bernard Cohen deconstructs the meaning of "Newtonian" for the history of economics and economic thought. He also identifies several vague and unspecified values associated with Newton from a specific meaning of Newtonian science and philosophy, which together amount to a particular social construction of "Newtonian." For Cohen himself, "Newtonian" means the combination of rational mechanics (the Principia) and experimental methods (the Opticks). This means that "Newtonian" rational mechanics does not include considerations of energy and its conservation, virtual displacement or virtual velocities, variational principles, and all the other additions to the subject made by such post-Newtonian figures as Euler, Lagrange, Laplace, Hamilton, Jacobi, and Poincare. (P. 56) Cohen's thesis is that this later Newtonian science did not and could not have served social science by providing a useful model for direct emulation or useful analogies, equations, laws or concepts (pp. 56, 75). Still, a Newtonian paradigm, not hitherto identified by social scientists, has served them, by way of example and metaphor. To make his point, Cohen identifies four levels of discourse: metaphorical, which assigns the name or the quality of something to something else; analogical, which denotes similarity of a function, relations or property; homology, which expresses similarity in form or structure, and; identity, which establishes actual sameness (p. 57).2 Cohen illustrates these distinctions by reviewing organismic theories of society, general social theory, and the work of Henry C. Carey and Leon Walras. On the basis of his analysis, Cohen suggests that Newtonian mechanics has benefited social science because it 1 emphasized the experimental, experiental and empirical, 2 promoted the use of organizing principles akin to gravitation, and 3 introduced a technique focusing on the differences between posited and observed systems (pp. 75-79). 2 Mirowski's pun presented in the subtitle might be considered to be a play on words which nears becoming a figure of speech. 346</page><page sequence="7">NATURAL IMAGES IN ECONOMICS Examples of the second and third kind of borrowings abound in economics (utility, social welfare, Malthus's theory of population, and the idea of perfect competition) while examples of the first kind are more difficult to come by. Cohen also identifies several difficulties that arose in attempts to borrow from Newtonian science. Among these problems were the use of incorrect science (pp. 64-65); imperfect replication because of creative transformation and inevitable distortion (pp. 65-68); useless or inappropriate science (pp. 69-75), which could, however, be of use to social science (p. 74); and applying analysis to problems that "do not permit analytical solution" (p. 74). While Cohen importantly remarks that misinterpretation and other error can lead to fruitful advances in social thought or science (p. 69), he does not consider the evaluative process which produces the judgment of "fruitful." Chapter 4, the first that treats mathematics, is by Ivor Grattan Guinness and is titled "From Virtual Velocities to Economic Action: The Very Slow Arrivals of Linear Programming and Locational Equilibrium." The author examines what he portrays as a century of mixed opportunities, identifying an early French mathematical concern with the development and application of calculus; twin nongenial professional interests: engineering and pure theory; false starts and near misses; and the importance of non-events and non-transfer to econom? ics. Grattan-Guinness stresses how one theory gains meaning within another and how incompetent transfer of theories from one science to another does not preclude fruitful results. However, Roy Weintraub's comment on Grattan-Guinness's conference paper suggests that the story may be more complicated. (The comment is available at Weintraub's home page on the World Wide Web through the Depart? ment of Economics at Duke University.) Randall Bausor, in chapter 5, contrasts the reception of the mathe? matics of qualitative dynamics in economics to that in fluid mechanics. He argues that these techniques have been resisted by mainstream neoclassicism because of the different empirical and evidentiary founda? tions of economics and fluid mechanics, and their distinct cultural and metaphorical backgrounds. Chaos theory in particular has been alien to deterministic mainstream economics, among whose cultural and met? aphorical filters are preconceptions of stability, the coherence of market system order and laissez-faire platitudes, and hence repugnance at anything that suggests instability (pp. 122-124). This contrasts starkly 347</page><page sequence="8">REVIEW OF SOCIAL ECONOMY with chaos theory's implications of extreme sensitivity to initial condi? tions, instability of systems, emphasis on structure of flow rather than on a single path, and the necessity to find solutions in the face of over? whelming complexity (pp. 113-114). Bausor offers three major lessons as to the importance of (mathemat? ical) metaphors in economics. First, mathematics influences its users' definitions of reality by making some metaphoric representations of it more accessible than others. Second, user preconceptions influence the attractiveness of certain mathematics and therefore of certain repre? sentations of reality. Third, beliefs generated by using certain mathe? matical (and other) metaphors influence what are taken to be observations, therefore governing future beliefs and what is considered as true, thus generating a path-dependent evolution of understanding. Thus mathematics has been a vehicle for transferring metaphorical definitions of reality from mathematics and physical sciences to economics. It also thereby both comprises metaphorical process between various sciences and partly constitutes the subject of econom? ics. Chapter 6, by Theodore M. Porter, is a masterpiece on rival ideas of quantification. Porter identifies the different roles ascribed to quantifi? cation in general, and mathematics and statistics in particular. The major roles, according to him, are constituting knowledge per se (rare) and serving as a check on both verbal deduction and its overextension as the Ricardian vice (common). Porter's account is wide-ranging and laden with more or less well-known points on the roles of quantifica? tion. He points to William Whewell's emphasis on mathematics to counter, not reinforce, classical theory and policy; to mathematics on the side of historieism, not the deductive Austrians; to the inter penetration of economics and engineering, and of economics and thermodynamics; to the availability of nineteenth-century engineering oriented alternatives to standard mathematical economics; to the nonuse of mathematics and even of marginalism by Jevons, Edgeworth, and Marshall in much of their work; to the sociological role of mathematics in professionalizing economics (as well as physics and mathematics itself) as more important than its heuristic use; and so on. Porter's summary of Fleeming Jenkins's treatment of the wages fund theory is must reading (pp. 137-138). Apropos of Mirowski's theme concerning the nonreceptivity of mathematical economics to physicists, Porter says that 348</page><page sequence="9">NATURAL IMAGES IN ECONOMICS It is, I think, wrong to suggest, as Mirowski has, that marginalists were bumblers and that the physicists detected logical flaws to which the economists remained oblivious. The nub of the matter is that the physicists and engineers discussed here were unable to see the point of purely theoretical economics. With very few exceptions, physicists and engineers took measurement to be more central than mathematical deductions to their discipline. (P. 154) As to the social construction of economics in the image of physics as it was constituted in the late nineteenth century, Porter concludes that While neoclassical economists may have derived much of their mathe? matical theory using analogies with physics, they were very far from accepting the prevailing standards of physics as a practice. (P. 157) The ethos of neoclassical economic theory ... seems alien to that of physics, even if much of its mathematics did come from statics and thermodynamics. (P. 158) In a discussion of Herbert Mehrten's interpretation of David Hilbert's axiomatic formulation of mathematics, Porter makes a fundamentally important argument: Mathematics does not describe a world, but posits one. It is a language of symbols that refers to nothing but itself. (P. 159) The same applies to all mathematical as well as to other kinds of economics: general equilibrium theory, for example, is fictional, saying nothing about the actual economy; it is but a conceptual and logical exercise. Saying so does not negate the mathematical nor any other program; all modes of doing economics, including mathematical and literary, ultimately tell stories and do not necessarily say anything conclusive about the economy. But the choice of mathematics, as the choice of any metaphor or symbolic system, counts: Mathematics is never neutral, never simply a technically superior way of accomplishing what practitioners of the social and the natural disciplines are already doing. Its triumph in economics was associated with a vast change in the practices of that field. Alternative uses of mathematics and quantification have sharply variant implications. (P. 160) 349</page><page sequence="10">REVIEW OF SOCIAL ECONOMY Among those variable implications is our definition of what the economy is all about and the manner in which it can be expressed. Thus Porter concludes that The scientific idea is often taken, not least by economists, as mono? lithic. ... The history of modern economics shows, as strikingly as any field, that this is a misconception. Imitating natural science is anything but an unproblematic endeavor. (Pp. 161-162) Uneasy Boundaries between Man and Machine Part III contains three essays, the first of which, by Timothy Alborn, explores the use of metaphors in Victorian times. Language both framed and conditioned the Victorian debates; it served as a means of expressing, grounding, and legitimizing sentiments and policy positions. Ambivalent and contradictory lessons were drawn from developments in industrial? ization, banking, and consumerism, for example, and were expressed in terms of metaphors, each having varying meanings and usages. In these debates natural was opposed to unnatural and, occasionally, to the mechanical. Alborn focuses on the metaphorical arguments of joint-stock and private bankers. The metaphors of the natural, machine, and circulation were used to establish and repudiate government protection of private interests of the bankers, each party seeking to enlist government support on their behalf. Metaphoric language was used to perceive, express and conduct "real," and not only semantic, conflicts of interests. Does anything better epitomize the politics ' metaphor than the discourse about which banking system is more "natural"? Chapter 8, by Michael White, examines the mechanical analogies of physiological psychology used by Richard Jennings and their sub? sequent modification by William Stanley Jevons. Important for White are the evolution of conflicts between naturalistic and scientific determinism and between determinism and free will. According to White, Jevons's solution, which fundamentally reconceptualized the domain of political economy, "was to arbitrarily label the laws of action as voluntary" (p. 224). White also notes that the adoption of particular metaphors transmits and creates "for a political economy a series of analytical problems" (p. 223) of specificity of meaning and of applica? tion. The hallmarks of a metaphor and its use are therefore selectivity and, consequently, problematicity. 350</page><page sequence="11">NATURAL IMAGES IN ECONOMICS Chapter 9, by Sharon Kingsland, explores the cross-fertilization of evolutionary biology, ecology, population demography, and economics. According to her, facilitated by the mathematization and scientization of all of these fields, images and procedures deemed useful in controlling nature, especially the concept of "energy," readily moved from one discipline to another. Kingsland's special focus is on the work of A. J. Lotka (1880-1949) in demography and physical biology. According to her, Lotka's work in the latter field was modeled directly on physical chemistry but also used economic ideas and influenced some economists as well, such as Henry Schultz and Herbert A. Simon. Organic Metaphors and their Stimuli Part IV contains seven chapters. The first, Chapter 10 by Paul Christensen, is entitled "Fire, Motion and Productivity: The Proto energetics of Nature and Economy in Francois Quesnay." Christensen, contrary to Joseph Schumpeter and Ronald Meek, argues that Ques? nay's economics was not self-contained but a reflection of both his mechanistic physiological model of the circulation of the blood and his "physical, chemical, physiological and 'ecological' theory of the production and circulation of materials in nature;" a theory of matter "combined with a theory of immanent design" (p. 250). According to Christensen, both Quesnay's doctrine of the sole productivity of agricultural labor and the Tableau economique are derived from the foregoing ingredients. Chapter 11, by Michael Hutter, provides an overview of the meanings of organism in general philosophy, philosophy of language, and social sciences, and examines the metaphor of organism in the works of Adam Muller, Friedrich List, Wilhelm Roscher, Karl Knies, Paul von Lilienfeld, Albert Schaffte, Carl Menger,3 Othmar Spann, Werner Sombart, and Walter Eucken. Hutter is interested in the 3 Discussing Menger's use of the metaphor?which, because Menger rejects certain organismic analysis, Hutter refers to as "a daring act of theoretical imperialism"?in the cases of money, language, and state (law), Hutter writes that "In the case of money, the institution can be represented by a material commodity. No signs, symbols, or other forms of communication seem necessary for the explanation" (p. 305). We consider that here Hutter fails to recognize that money is but a system of signs and symbols, not depending of the material vehicle or signifier such as pieces of paper or metal, shells or squirrel skins used to convey its meaning. 351</page><page sequence="12">REVIEW OF SOCIAL ECONOMY apparent failure of biological/organic images in economies, asking whether "Is it a feature within the biological paradigm, or is it a problem of transferring?" (p. 289). Hutter notes that the "suspected contribution of organic images to national socialist ideology" (p. 289) might have decreased interest in organic metaphors. However, he seemingly does not recognize the ostensibly greater determinacy of mechanistic analogies and their (paradoxical) compatibility with notions of individual responsibility. Hutter observes the continued presence of organicism in institutional economics and?paradoxically, in the light of his methodological individualism?in Hayek's concep? tion of spontaneous order. Hutter expects that developments in social and communications systems theory may revive organismic metaphors in social sciences. Chapter 12, by Margaret Schabas, examines Darwinian themes in John Stuart Mill and Alfred Marshall. She rejects the argument that Darwin influenced Mill, Marshall and other early neoclassical econo? mists. According to Schabas, Darwin emphasized the superiority of natural selection over man, in contrast with Mill's emphasis on man's control over nature. In neoclassical economics, economic order is within the domain of the artificial and is entirely man-made. Darwin, Schabas argues, was not influential in economic thought until much later. One wishes that Schabas had here done the same for "Darwinian" that Cohen did for "Newtonian," and also considered and examined historical and institutional economics. In Chapter 13, Camille Limoges and Claude Menard examine the biological metaphors present in Alfred Marshall's Principles of Eco? nomics. Their focus is on organization and division of labor in Book IV. They acknowledge the spectrum of different interpretations of the presence and role of biological analogies in Marshall's economics, and claim both that Marshall was carefully selective in his choice and deployment of biological analogies and that their use was fundamental, however eclipsed by his own (in Book V, for example) and later mechanistic analysis of markets. Limoges and Menard's analysis implies that mechanistic and biological/organicist (and possibly other) heuristic metaphors widely coexist, a phenomenon to be expected if one accepts that cognitive processes are metaphorical (see our remarks on Klamer and Leonard above). In the following Chapter (14), Neil Niman argues that economics and especially the theory of the firm could benefit from the use of 352</page><page sequence="13">NATURAL IMAGES IN ECONOMICS biological analogies. He identifies two special applications for them; namely, providing assistance in identifying, describing and classifying economic agents and events, and providing "new insights into what can be done to resolve some of the difficulties in [economists'] own synthesis" (p. 361). Niman also discusses the steps of identification, translation and modification that are necessary to import metaphoric conceptions from biological disciplines and theories. In Chapter 15, Alexander Rosenberg presents an opposite view of the applicability of biological and evolutionary analogies to economics, either "to vindicate received theory or to underwrite new theory against a reasonable standard of predictive success," (p. 384) in both biological and social sciences. In his opinion To some economists, evolutionary theory looks like a tempting cure for what ails their subject. To others, it looks like part of a powerful defense of the status quo in economic theory. I think that Darwinian theory is a remarkably inappropriate model, metaphor, inspiration, or theoretical framework for economic theory. The theory of natural selection shares few of its strengths and most of its weaknesses with neoclassical theory, and provides no help in any attempt to frame more powerful alternatives to that theory. (P. 384) Our respect for Rosenberg notwithstanding, we find this objectionable. He may be correct in emphasizing the limits of natural selection as a metaphor. However, his negative view partly originates from his narrow conception of what a metaphor is and how a borrowed metaphor may benefit a line of thought. Evolution theory may be a useful source of metaphors for economics once one drops the controversial require? ment of predictive power and paradigmatic conceptions incompatible with evolutionary ideas, such as the concept of an equilibrating market system. For example, institutional economics builds on the metaphor of cumulative causation and open-ended, non-teleological change. Even Chicago-School law and economics has used its own version of an evolutionary metaphor, according to which the evolution of institutions such as property maximizes welfare. However one could criticize this view from other viewpoints, it is an example of the use of an evolutionary concept within economics, albeit a use in which an ambiguous and tautological measure of "welfare-maximizing" is substituted for an equally ambiguous and tautological measure of "the 353</page><page sequence="14">REVIEW OF SOCIAL ECONOMY fittest." The evolutionary approach is more powerful than this use permits. Rosenberg acknowledges the well-recognized influence of Adam Smith and Thomas Robert Malthus on Charles Darwin, and claims that "the terms of trade [a metaphor?] are always in the direction from economics to biology" (p. 385). Rosenberg ends with a remark that places himself and his conceptions of the heuristic role of the metaphor and the problems of their literal transfer in a perspective that is best characterized by Mirowski's first metanarrative on the natural and the social: The role of metaphors in science is not well understood. Indeed, the role of metaphors is still controversial in its home ground in language. It should be no surprise that when we metaphorically or otherwise extend literary metaphor to scientific practice, matters become quickly obscure. Darwin's notion of blind variation and natural selection has been one of the most tempting of metaphors in the social sciences. Whether it has been a source of fruitful stimulation is debatable. Whether the theories cut to its pattern have been well confirmed or not seems to me to be the only interesting question for scientists in these disciplines to actually concern themselves with. All the rest is ad hominem argument or the genetic fallacy. (Pp. 406-407) Rosenberg's arguments are followed by a quite different approach to evolutionary theory by Geoffrey Hodgson. In Chapter 16 he examines the evolutionary metaphor used by Friedrich Hayek. Hodgson critiques Hayek's work with regard to intentionality, purposefulness and choice, hence the problem of coming to grips with the balancing of deliberative and nondeliberative decision making. Hodgson himself rejects sole reliance on both methodological individualism and methodological collectivism as "the extremes of both individualistic indeterminacy and determinism" (p. 411). He also rejects the erection of disciplinary tastes (that actors' goal and belief formation lies outside of economics) into scientific canons and the failure to take the limits of such exclusion into account in theory and policy analysis. Also present in Hodgson's analysis are Hayek's neglect of Darwin? ian natural selection, his critique of Social Darwinism, and his failure to pay enough attention to selection mechanisms. Hodgson specifically examines whether rules or individuals are or can be taken to be analogous to genes, by differentiating between ontogenic (development 354</page><page sequence="15">NATURAL IMAGES IN ECONOMICS of a particular organism) and phylogenic (evolution of a population of organisms) change. Writes Hodgson: Our attitudes and beliefs often change dramatically during the course of our lives. Yet even if particular individuals were wrongly regarded as invariant and akin to the [unchanging] genes, then the population of individuals would change through time. As selection takes place, the overall set of individual preference functions will change. These, in turn, would have to be explained. (P. 412) Hodgson shows the more or less unique, if not deviant, nature of Hayekian evolutionary theory, which he suggests ironically "does not support the kind of political and policy conclusions that Hayek wished to sustain" (p. 409). Hodgson also laments the methodological indi? vidualism of Hayek which Hodgson says led him astray from the rich possibilities of his evolutionary analysis. Present in Hodgson's analysis is also Hayek's combination of anti-constructivism and constructivism, laden with increasing recognition of and emphasis on the latter. On the basis of Samuels's study of Hayek's theory of spontaneous order, he finds that Hodgson correctly assesses its inconclusive probative value. In Hayek's analysis, both nondeliberative and deliberative but even? tually deliberative, and both nonconstructivist and constructivist but eventually constructivist, elements coexist. Hayek's preferred ideologi? cal and policy messages coexist with his more positive analysis but increasingly, as his thought matured, the positive outweighed the normative, with the recognition of the deliberative and constructivist elements. Negotiating over Nature Part V contains four essays, the first, Chapter 17 by Mirowski, entitled "The Realms of the Natural." Mirowski argues for and presents evidence of the existence and importance of the quest for a sense of order. This quest leads people to adopt and to create images that impose order, whether or not what the images lead us to understand is "really out there"?this is the psychic balm function of science, art and religion, according to Shackle. Mirowski stresses the process of constructing conceptions of order and points to the dominant reliance on descriptions of the social in terms of the natural?what most if not all of the preceding authors have 355</page><page sequence="16">REVIEW OF SOCIAL ECONOMY treated in one way or the other. However, he goes forward from the position presented above and remarks that constructions of the Natural are themselves Social, and by twisting an idea of Mary Douglas notes that anthropomorphic ideas of mastery and control induce a bias in cultures to project their own social categories onto their explanations of the external world; but in an infinite regress, subsequent reification of notions of order prompts others in the same culture to appropriate those preceding Natural concepts and re-project them back into models and images of society. (P. 453) Mirowski's next main argument, paralleling that of Bruno Latour (e.g. 1993), is that the Natural and the Social have been and still are continuously negotiated. He holds that this takes place especially when the taken-for-granted categories are questioned by catastrophic acci? dents, disasters or the occurrence of otherwise unusual phenomena, for example. Mirowski substantiates his argument by examining, compar? ing and interpreting the social significance of animal trials and the investigation of the explosion of space shuttle Challenger. He claims that their social purpose is not to bring the scientific [or legal] method to bear on the problem, but rather to reconfigure the threatened boundaries of the Social and the Natural by relegating the offending phenomenon to its correct category. (P. 468) This is because people do not want to be told that risk and danger can be mathematically formalized, packaged, and sold like some sort of dog food, and that they had unwittingly though voluntarily bought into this commodity and therefore had to suffer the consequences of their purchase. The role of the juridical inquiry in a crisis is rather to determine which calamitous transgressions were Natural and which were Social, to reduce the complexity of the transgression to an anthropomorphically comprehen? sible phenomenon, the better to mete out blame and punishment accordingly. (P. 476) Another example of the foregoing "process of sorting out the natural and the social" is the seeking of political and other, perhaps natural, actors to blame for unemployment, recession or other phenomena. Other factors, such as political and economic interests intrude and 356</page><page sequence="17">NATURAL IMAGES IN ECONOMICS channel this process, and this is why "nature" and "natural" have been strongly ideological metaphors, suitable for use in conflicts and power play that are partially fought in the fields of language, as was demonstrated by Alborn in Chapter 7. Chapter 18, by James P. Henderson, discusses "The Place of Economics in the Hierarchy of the Sciences: Section F from Whewell to Edgeworth." Henderson focuses on the concepts of science and scientific procedure, such as induction versus deduction, quantification and statistics, mathematization and predictive power as a test. These were deployed and debated in the Section F of the British Association for the Advancement of Science and the Royal Economic Society. In Chapter 19, James Bernard Murphy examines "The kinds of Order in Society." Murphy presents a deep, subtle and sophisticated analysis of social order4 in the light of Aristotle's progressive trichotomy of nature, custom and stipulation. Murphy holds that the elements of the Aristotelian trichotomy are "fundamental concepts of order in the sense that all other concepts of order can be shown to be derivative" (p. 539). These derivatives include organism and mechanism, which for Murphy are variations of the same theme: "they attempt to explain structure as if it were deliberately designed for its function" (p. 541). Aristotle's trichotomy expresses or is a metaphor for an ontological structure, a particular definition of reality which can be structured also in other ways. Murphy explores these alternative conceptions of order in the works of, for example, Immanuel Kant, Adam Smith, Max Weber, Steven Jay Gould, E. O. Wilson, Claude Levi-Strauss, and Mary Douglas. He observes a persistent tendency to understand the elements of the trichotomy as interdefinable, with the effect of collapsing the customary to the natural, with some stipulation of each in terms of the other. Murphy underlines the progressive hierarchy within the trichot? omy and the implications it has for social sciences: the natural, the customary and the stipulation are all constitutive of our socially constructed reality. Here Murphy comes close to the views forwarded by Latour (19-93). Murphy distinguishes between two forms of naturalism. The first 4 Curiously, Murphy makes no mention of Joseph Spengler's essay, "The Problem of Order in Economic Affairs" (1948; see also Samuels 1996). Spengler's essay covers some of the same ground but approaches and structures the concept of order differently. 357</page><page sequence="18">REVIEW OF SOCIAL ECONOMY denotes causal determination by nature and the other posits formal analogy with nature. Murphy concludes that "Analogies should lead to the search for causes rather than serve as a substitute for genuine causal explanation, because arguments from analogy to nature are not empirically falsifiable, while arguments from natural causation are" (p. 550). The point is both well taken and subject to critique. While figures of speech can have a heuristic function, they can indeed also stultify and foreclose analysis. Another question, however, is the extent to which arguments from natural causation really are falsifiable, if we are to accept Randall Bausor's argument according to which what we already (metaphorically) know is what we observe, and thus come to believe as true. The final chapter of the volume is by David Chioni Moore, on "Feminist Accounting Theory as a Critique of What's 'Natural' in Economics." According to Moore, in his speech to the American Accounting Association, Rudiger Dornbusch asserted that "the only thing factual that economists talked about was accounting information?everything past that was mere theory." Moore recounts how well the audience knew how wrong Dornbusch was; that "every accounting number ever produced has been, to say the least, highly contestable. What Dornbusch revealed," according to Moore, "in his off-the-cuff remark was that accounting had achieved, at least in the eyes of some major economists, the ultimate goal of the rhetorician's art: to be perceived as not rhetoric at all, but as the facts, the real, the truth or the natural" (p. 583). Moore's approach is to offer "a feminist critique of the naturalness of accounting" (p. 584), predicated upon a view according to which accountants produce not truth but texts; texts that do not so much reflect reality as construct particular versions of complex realities; versions constructed according to historical genres, or conventions; accounting conventions neither absolute nor universal but that vary across epochs and cultures; conventions that each embody (in both their in- and their exclusions) the various social, economic, and political interests of the specific race, gender, and class group that produce the accounts in the first place. And accounting is irremediably that way. (P. 584) Moore's feminist critique of accounting subscribes, among other things, to views according to which "women have been under-, mis-, and nonrepresented throughout the modern Western history of purport 358</page><page sequence="19">NATURAL IMAGES IN ECONOMICS edly objective accounting" (p. 586); there is a tension between the realist feminism which wants to set the record straight, to present the correct or natural image of women, and the constructivist feminism according to which accounting rather constructs than depicts reality (p. 589); reconstruction is needed of how and where value is created within firms, to give fuller credit to women's economic work and to counter "natural-category privileges that accounting accords to ... individuals and firms" (p. 592); the barriers to entry and advancement for women in the accounting profession have influenced accounting procedures and the resulting definitions of reality; and so on. In Moore's view, existing accounting systems, both business and national income accounting, reflect capitalism's and masculine indi? vidualist points of view. He calls for a reformulation of our conceptions of the economy and a reconstruction of accounting and economics. Like other feminist writers, Moore appreciates the importance of self reflexive argumentation. Not surprisingly, albeit unusually, Moore presents in the concluding section a critique of his own work. One of its limitations, according to Moore, is that it is constructed and should not be given ontological primacy, however important it may be. For Moore, "there is no 'natural' way to answer these questions" (p. 592), because "The natural, if it exists at all, is surely not available in this endless network" (p. 602). II. THE RESULTING ANALYSIS This section outlines the general observations and conclusions which emerge from the collection as a result of our review, somewhat avoiding restatement of points that have already been presented. It is not assumed that every reader?or, for that matter, every contributor? would reach the same conclusions. By the same token, even the summaries presented in the preceding section are matters of inter? pretation. The volume amply demonstrates that metaphors and other figures of speech are ubiquitous in the discourse of economists. Such familiar economic concepts as "competition," "invisible hand," "equilibrium," "markets," "scissors of demand and supply," "prisoner's dilemma," and "games" all make the point clear. Human use of metaphors is fecund: we have employed numerous metaphors and given each multiple meanings and definitions. For example, Samuels, in his research on 359</page><page sequence="20">REVIEW OF SOCIAL ECONOMY probably the most famous economic metaphor, the Invisible Hand, has found over three dozen identifications of the invisible hand and over a dozen different functions it is supposed to perform. Perhaps the most important metaphorical dimension of the contem? porary mainstream economics is?ironically?its mathematics. The mathematics employed by economists was developed in the physical sciences and adopted by economists in part because they believed that mathematics represents the pure fundamentals of the economy directly and in part because mathematics was considered to accord economics something of the scientific status of physics or mathematics itself. However, mathematics, no less than economics, was and is a language, both socially constructed and metaphoric. For economists, mathematics has been the principal vehicle for defining economic reality, as several of the contributors indicate. No longer is there any uncritical presump? tion that the mathematics mirrors either physical or social reality: it is a tool-box of particular metaphors serving the purposes of all met? aphors. In general, metaphors perform various intellectual and other func? tions, among which they 1 provide definitions of reality and thus help to construct it; 2 organize ideas and thoughts, ultimately constituting theories and/or disciplines in particular ways; 3 as heuristic devices, facilitate the search for ideas and hypotheses; 4 decorate, illustrate, and provide pedagogical support; 5 help to establish, transfer, and transform meaning; 6 serve ideological functions in power-play and conflicts over, for example, meaning; and 7 provide order, consolation and psychic balm. Particular metaphors serve these functions more or less simultaneously; they provide, inter alia, as Joan Robinson (1962, Chapter 1) insisted, both ideological tools and scientific hypotheses. To the extent "nature" is indeed as inaccessible as Moore asserts or, to put it in another way, to the extent that cognitive processes are inescapably metaphoric, as Klamer and Leonard argue, we are bound to use some metaphors. This underlines the problematicity and selectivity of the choice and use of metaphors. The questions become, Which metaphors to choose?, that is, In which way the metaphors we choose (whether nondeliberatively or deliberately) to adopt or borrow 360</page><page sequence="21">NATURAL IMAGES IN ECONOMICS define the reality?, On what aspects of the reality the metaphors focus our attention and what they exclude from it?, and What kind of courses of action they prompt when used, for example, in policy analysis or proposals? Suffice it to say that some metaphoric expressions implying the "naturalness" of a phenomenon, such as in the phrase "natural rate of unemployment," are strongly political and ideological devices (for the politics of nature, see Soper 1995). The volume also presents evidence that metaphors circulate from one discipline to another, perhaps later returning to the discipline of their origin in a modified form.5 This phenomenon points to the argument of Michel Fo?cault (1972), according to which discursive formations define the statements, concepts, and strategies available for subjects within a discourse, and that the rules or deep structures constituting the discourses are relatively stable. His own work (Fou cault 1970) demonstrates how certain conceptions of divine, natural and human order dominated human sciences across disciplinary borders, to the extent that one can speak of disciplines in the eras Foucault studied. On the basis of the contributions, modern Western science has quite sparingly recycled its central constitutive and heuristic metaphors, thus establishing relatively uniform ontological, epistemological, and meth? odological foundations across disciplines. This has also meant that particular paths have been followed in Western science at the expense of other possible ones. The mechanism through which this has been effectuated is that to speak "scientifically" or to be listened to in one's scientific community requires that one obeys the rules of its discourse. These rules thus have both a sociological role in constituting the community of discourse and ontological, epistemological and meth? odological roles in channeling and structuring its inquiries in particular ways and establishing certain criteria for its members to take the results of the inquiries of its members as "true" (see Shapin 1994 on early experimentalists). Metaphors are vital for this process in that they embody, crystallize, transfer, and modify these discursive rules. The circulation of metaphors may have promoted a certain degree of uniformity within the disciplines of their circulation, because the more 5 This phenomenon is touched on by several contributors. It is not a new idea but quite widely employed. One author (Edwards 1996) argues, for example, that computer terminology and the terminology of cognitive sciences were shaped by Cold War social and cultural contexts and that these were in turn transformed by the former. 361</page><page sequence="22">REVIEW OF SOCIAL ECONOMY fundamental metaphors partly reconstitute the target domain to which they are transferred. Moreover, not just the target domains, but also the metaphors themselves are transformed in the process of circulation. A redefinition or a rereading of a metaphor can also occur within a target domain during the course of time, thus changing its meaning. A metaphor thus has a history created by these transformations and rereadings, and it is amenable to support different and perhaps contradictory themes and theories, with possibly different and contra? dictory implications between its uses. There seems to be no reason to believe that either the narrative of "degradation" or the narrative of "perfection" could guide the selection or reading of a metaphor. Meanings of metaphors evolve to an extent arbitrarily, and both the readings imposing gradual "pollution" of meaning or gradual achievement of truth or perfection (a common vice in Whig history of thought) are equally meaningless; newly borrowed or reread metaphors may stimulate and expand understanding in some directions while limiting and contracting it in others. Ultimately, there is no "real" test for the fruitfulness of one metaphor over another (however, the commonplace observation is that new images seemingly rejuvenate thinking, which may imply that more metaphors are better than fewer). That histories of meanings are often interpreted through the narrative of perfection just demonstrates the human tendency to impose extra-human order upon humanly constructed phenomena. Metaphors are indeed created, borrowed, read, and reread by humans; in short, they are socially constructed. Especially for this reason, the choice of a metaphor matters: a metaphor is, in part, a definition of reality and, transforms, besides our ideas about the social and the natural, the material nature and society around us when we act upon our metaphoric beliefs. This also reveals the importance of scientific preconceptions and/or paradigmatic beliefs: they channel and direct the choice and readings of metaphors in particular ways, and bring ideology to bear on the meaning and the referent of the metaphors. Metaphors are part and product of a complex and kaleidoscopic process in which scientific theories and disciplines, the metaphors of the Social and the Natural as referents of other metaphors (whatever their essential properties are), can be seen to form an overdetermined system. In the process of change within this system, the formation of knowledge, the creation and transformation of metaphors and ideology, 362</page><page sequence="23">NATURAL IMAGES IN ECONOMICS among other factors, are intertwined and inseparable. Fundamentally important are not the substantive meanings the metaphors gain in any particular moment, but the process in which their meanings are worked out. Perhaps the deepest metaphorical formulation in economics is that of the economy as a given, self-subsistent, transcendent and ergodic process which generates unique determinate optimum equilibrium allocative results on the basis of pre-reeonciled prices. This conception gives short shrift to both human choice and the structural variables operating in generating that choice. It also enables ex post legitimation of problematic ex ante developments, especially including those that are a function of power and power play. And it, along with both naturalism per se and the pure mathematical presentations of the market, and because of its resort to claims of ontological accuracy, provides an appealing and persuading justification for laissez-faire sentiments (a point made by Porter, p. 1241, and Alborn, p. 176 and passim, among others). The deployment of natural and other metaphors has taken place in a continual struggle to work out the putative boundaries of the "natural" economy and the domain of government. This has resulted in the modern situation of the juxtaposition of two views, that of the "pure" market and that of markets as a function of institutions, including law and subject to legal change. Even here, however, as McCloskey has insisted, the term market is itself a metaphor?and so is "law." Alas, we are inevitably caught up in our language?which is, after all, one key point generated by the Natural Images collection. III. CONCLUDING COMMENTS In economics and in other social sciences the meanings conveyed by metaphors are instrumental in the social construction of important (discursive, structural, and material) dimensions of economy, polity and society. Also, our identities as subjects or persons are tied up with and worked out through them. Metaphors are an aspect of not only the social construction of reality but of conflict, social control, power play, and psychic balm. At the bottom are the questions of the type and structure of society humankind wishes to create for itself and how to get there from where it presently is. Careful attention to and deconstruction of the metaphorical and other aspects of the language of scholars, 363</page><page sequence="24">REVIEW OF SOCIAL ECONOMY politicians and clergy, the professionals of metaphors and thus of the social construction of reality, is therefore needed. One of the tasks of the history of economic thought as an intellectual discipline is to examine, penetrate, and deconstruct the stories told by different schools of economists. This is an important task. As Roy Weintraub (forthcoming) says, "To take the rhetoric of economics seriously is to be willing to think about language, and its deployment in economic argument, in a serious fashion. But it is also to problematize notions of evidence, facts, theory, conclusion, model, test, and the whole panoply of economists' public and respectable modes of discourse." From this viewpoint, the presently reviewed volume clearly is a contribution to the development of the rhetorical and deconstructive turn in economics and in the history of economic thought. Michel Foucault's conception of deep structures of discourse and the work of other constructivist and linguistically oriented scholars in philosophy and in history of science/thought can guide the realization of this rhetorical and deconstructive turn. However, believers in Mirowski's first three metanarratives are not likely to accept that what they believe is not "truth" but only another story, perhaps only another metaphor. The trouble is exacerbated when the historian of economic thought is also a critic of the object of study (Mirowski is, of course, a critic of neoclassical economics; but he has also written critically of institutional economics). Every scholar should be conscious of and learn to live with the tension between the idea that their beliefs and findings are in some sense meaningful, true and even useful, and the idea that they are, at the same time, telling stories, often largely in terms of metaphors, and persuading us to accept them as meaningful, true and/or useful, whatever these terms mean in any particular situation. Numerous topics remain to be explored in this area in a more detailed, deliberate and elaborate manner than could have been attained in this volume. Among these are 1 the significance of two further distinctions present in the discourse of economics and other social sciences: that between natural and artificial (or unnatural), including but not limited to the economy as a "natural" phenomenon transcendent to man; and that between natural, sometimes discursively equated with social, and individual, as in discussions about unemployment ("the natural rate of unemployment" concept); 364</page><page sequence="25">NATURAL IMAGES IN ECONOMICS 2 the philosophical and discursive deconstruction of natural and other images with regard to ontology and epistemology; and 3 the relations between constitutive and heuristic metaphors, and between their constitutive and heuristic functions, including the propensity of the constitutive functions to overwhelm the heuristic ones. The theme that the economy is too complex, heterogeneous and kaleidoscopic?as well as giving rise to phenomena capable of variable and subjective evaluation?to be adequately dealt with by any one or even few metaphors, is nicely portrayed by the Toles political cartoon (The New Republic, January 8 and 15, 1996, p. 11). The cartoon pictures Santa Claus sitting at his workbench talking to an elf. An announcer on television is reporting that Consumers have dramatically cut back their borrowing which could slow the economy, but which might be a healthy development after their earlier borrowing, which boosted the economy but added concerns of low saving and overstimulation, but could result in sluggish sales leading into the all-important Christmas sales period ... In response, Santa says to the elf: "It used to be a lot easier to know if they've been bad or good." The obvious question arises: What is the economy at the macro level, really? And for what is Santa Claus a metaphor, or is he not a metaphor? REFERENCES Edwards, Paul (1996) The Closed World: Computers and the Politics of Cold World America, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.
