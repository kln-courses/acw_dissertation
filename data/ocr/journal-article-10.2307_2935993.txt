<plain_text><page sequence="1">APOLLO'S FIRST LOVE: PINDAR, PYTH. 9.26 ff. LEONARD WOODBURY Uttiversity College, Toronto The Ninth Pythian is the most romantic of Pindar's odes. Though composed for Telesicrates, the winner of the hoplite-race at Delphi in 474, it concerns his city, Cyrene, which, as we learn elsewherc (Pyth. 5.24), possessed a "sweet garden of Aphrodite" (yAVKV'V KrrO7TV AOpo- StTa&amp;) and is here (74) called Telesicrates' "land of fair women (KaAACyvIvatKt 7Ta-pa). Four myths tell stories of love and marriage and it is said in praise of the victor (98-IoO) that young women who were spectators of his victory prayed silently that they might have such a husband or son. The luxuriance of the imagery of vegetation, and in particular the occurrenlce of the plucked flower (37 and iiO), have been seen to be especially appropriate, not only to the fertile land of Libya, but also to the erotic theme of the ode.I So insistenlt is the theme of marriage that it has seemed to many that it must have an application to the victor himself, apart from the obvious implication that he is praised for his beauty and attractiveness.2 For this purpose the first and longest of the myths, which tells of Apollo's love for the nymph Cyrene and the birth of Aristaeus (5-70), has proved most suggestive. But here everything depends upon the initerpretation of the scene, the most memorable passage in the ode, in which Apollo seeks the advice of Cheiron concerning his love for Cyreine. He is still enrolled as a pupil in the Centaur's school for I R. W. B. Burton, Pindar's Pythian Odes (Oxford I962) 44. I am grateful to two former pupils, Dr. Emmet Robbins and Mr. DonaldJ. Mastronarde, who have made me aware of the frequency of imagery of this kind and of other kinds in the ode. 2 It is worth noticin-g that iro'rus, which is used of Telesicrates (99), had already been used at a climactic point of the myth of Cyrene (5I).</page><page sequence="2">562 LEONARD WOODBURY [I972 heroes, where Achilles, Asclepius, and Jason were also reared in the Greek excellences, and the authority of the wise Cheiron, and of his answer, is unquestionable, if we could only divine its meaning. Much depends upon our reading of his words, as may be seen from the strange interpretations put upon them by eminent Pindarists. For cautionary purposes it is sufficient to mention, after Gildersleeve,3 the views of three scholars of the last century, Friedrich Mezger, Ludolph Dissen, and August Boeckh. The first thought that Telesicrates is urged to hasten his marriage, the second that he was guilty of the rape of a Theban girl, and the third that he is cautioned (in Gildersleeve's dry paraphrase) "against the anticipation of the lawful joys of marriage." More recent critics have recognised a moral that persuasion be pre- ferred to violence in love, in case Telesicrates or his friends had need of such advice, or a concern to distinguish marriage from sex in the loves of gods for mortal women, as if there existed for these purposes courting-customs, established churches, or registry-offices.4 The book of the wise sayings of Cheiron, the 'Y7TOO KaL XEpwcovos, must have presented a pattern unfamiliar to the education of the Greek nobility, if it contained matter of this kind.S After a rapid account of Cyrene's abduction by Apollo from Pelion to Libya and of her lineal descent from Earth and Ocean, the myth paints an enchanting picture of the girl's scorn for womanly occupa- tions and her indefatigable hunting of wild beasts.6 Apollo first sees her engaged in single combat with a terrific lion and at once summons Cheiron from his cave with words of wonder for her fearlessness and two questions concerning her origins. There follows the critical passage, another double question: 3 B. L. Gildersleeve, Pindar: The Olympian and Pythian Odes (New York i885) 337-3 8. 4 See, e.g., R. P. Winnington-Ingram, "Pindar's Ninth Pythian Ode" BICS i6 (I969) 9-I5, especially Io-II; R. W. B. Burton, Pindar's Pyth. Odes 40; L. Illig, Zur Form der pindarischen Erziihlung (Berlin I932) 44-45. The proprieties are a common preoccupation of commentators: Illig 37 supposes that Cheiron advises that Apollo and Cyrene should come indoors and Winnington-Ingram ii, that Cyrene should receive " a proper establishment". 5 On the ' Y7TO O7Kat XEpwovos, see R. Merkelbach and M. L. West, Fragmenta Hesiodea (Oxford I967) fr. 283-85; W. Jaeger, Paideia2 i (Oxford I945) 25; J. Schwartz, Pseudo- Hesiodeia (Leiden I960) 228-44. 6 Cyrene bears a certain resemblance to Apollo's sister, Artemis: cf.

He speaks ,apev 'S,9 by virtue of his prophetic wisdom, and his brow is gentle, ayava . . .pvJt, unmarked by any frown.Io He laughs, but the particular quality of his laughter is likely to elude us because of the textual uncertainty. xALapov (yEAacororau ) is the reading of our MSS, but XAapov is given by the scholia. The metre requires a dissyllable, so that XAtapov must be an interpretation of the unfamiliar XAapov. This derivation is in fact offered by one of the scholiasts (2.226 Drachmann), who show even greater doubts about the true reading. They are able to suggest, in addition to XAtapov, an unknown XAt8&amp;v (or XAr8o&amp;v). From the first they derive the sense "warm" and so "gentle and pleasant" (7rponryvr Kai' rEprrva), from the second a notion of quantity (XAt&amp;ov yap AE'yovout ro VA 0osg. ... oV'rCtS ovV c7tvoAvz yEAacora&amp;). Both interpretations seem mere guesses, without adequate support. Hesychius glosses XAapov with five unsuitable meanings (pvwrapov, AE7-rTO'V, rpvXaAEov, 4xpov and EAatqpoKs I(coOv), but also withKOXAae. This last is identified by LSJ with KaiXA-e, a "pebble," which seems to be an onomatopoeic formation, " the plasher," from KaXAMcLw. If we 7On the contracted form lpa, seeJ. D. Denniston, The Greek Particles 2 (Oxford I954) 284. This reading is preferable to putting a question mark after 7 'a, with Gildersleeve, or using the disjunctive 7' 'a, with Hermann. The first seems too artificial and the second misconceives the relation between Apollo's questions, as if he wished to distin- guish between sex and marriage. 8 U. von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Pindaros (Berlin I922) 267-68, is concerned with Pindar's relation with his source for the story of Cyrene, the Hesiodic Ehoiai. It has been inferred that Apollo's first question, conceming her origins, is an undigested survival from that source, in which it was answered by Cheiron: see 0. Schroeder, Pindars Pythien (Leipzig and Berlin I922) 8o; L. Illig, Ztir Form d.pind. Erz. 3 5; R. W. B. Burton, Pindar's Pyth. Odes 39-40. It is certain that Pindar has already included Cyrene's genealogy in his narrative (13-I8), but his poetic purpose in separating the question from its answer remains unexplained. Perhaps the first question is merely to establish that this is Apollo's first sight of Cyrene. 9 So Medea is A177ra . .. .a,uEv's- 7rais at Pyth. 4. Io-II. I0 A. S. F. Gow argues in CR 58 (I944) 3 8-39 for a wider meaning of oOpv's., to include "eye " and "lid" as well as "'brow".</page><page sequence="4">564 LEONARD WOODBURY [927I could believe that this sense came from a gloss onI our passage, it would be possible to suppose that some one found an onomatopoeic sense in XAapov and glossed the rare word with the "plasher." Such a sense perhaps, is found in connection with laughter in the familiar Aeschylean (Pronm. Viuict. 90-9I) rovi-tw)v TE KV/LaTWV aV?qpt/0LoV y'Aaurta. But this is only another guess. Of modern conjectures the best is Schroeder's XAoapov, though parallels are lacking. Schroeder himself acknowledges the difficulty of interpreting colour-words in extended senses and is willing to con- template such diverse meanings as "mocking" or "faint" laughter. The conjecture provides us with a possible word but no secure sense. On the other hand, the scholiasts, in spite of their uncertainties about the text, show some considerable feeling for the sense that is required. They offer KEXaAaoruE'Vov, and, in connection with another interpreta- tion, speak of a 8taXvorts, which is contrasted with a frown. Indeed, the verb XaAacw is used of the remission of anger and with the dative signifies "to be indulgent to. It may well be that XAapo'v existed as an alternative for XaAapo'v and is what Pindar wrote." In that case Cheiron's smile would be "cheery" or the like, the opposite of a frown, and would signify approval and indulgence. A cheery smile that banishes anger and reproach and promises indulgence to Apollo is in fact a more appropriate attitude for the Centaur to take in response to Apollo's questions and agrees well with the expression of gentleniess that he wears on his brow. The notion that there is an edge of rebuke or irony in the Centaur's response, which is widely held, cannot be supported by the description of his expression, so far as we can determine it. It rests instead on a common interpretation of Apollo's questions and Cheiron's answer.I2 II See LSJ s.v. xaAa'c I.2 and 8 for the two relevant senses of the verb. After this paper had been submitted for publication I was glad to read in CP 67 (October I972) 288-9i, E. D. Francis' "'Chiron's Laughter' (Pyth. 9.38)," in which he argues with greater fulness the proposal that *XAapos. be explained as an adjective formed from the root of XaAaorac. He compares the pattern of UrKEAE-/UKA-q-, Sacqa-/ua-, Oava-/0v6-, KTA. I2 For the most recent and candid statement of the view, see R. P. Winnington- Ingram in BICS I6 (I969) io. He writes: "Is it right to do what? To go straight out on to the hillside and rape the girl. This is the clear suggestion of XE'Pa od 7TpOUEVEyKEWV; and when Apollo says KEFpaLL 1,ALa8E'a rot'av, he is thinking of his own pleasure only. That is the question. . . " Winnington-Ingram offers no argument in support of "the</page><page sequence="5">Vol. I03] APOLLO S FIRST LOVE 565 That interpretation, in turn, needs only to be plainly stated to be shown to be absurd. It holds, in its most explicit form, that the god asks permission to rape the girl. But in fact there is nothing in Apollo's language that proposes or implies the use of violence. It is true that, much earlier, at the beginning of the myth (6), the violent verb apvrao' was used of Apollo, but that occurred in a description of Cyrene's forcible abduction from the vales of Pelion to the rich land of Libya; it has nothing to say about sexual assault. It would indeed be grotesque for Apollo to make an enquiry about holiness, of the kind that all Greeks made to him at Delphi, with regard to his own commission of so brutal an act.'3 Nor does the interpretation receive any support from the gnomic passage which follows immediately after Cheiron's speech (66-69): WoKELa 8 El7TEtO0EVWV )87 0EWYV 7tpc4LS o8ol TE PpaXEZaL. KElVO KE a pap StaLcLaLEw OaAdaLp 8E JlyEv Ev 7roAvXpv'acu Alfv'as!. The subject is a traditional view of the divine omnipotence, which hardly needs illustration after Cheiron's eloquent statement on omniscience. Because the gods hold in their hands the "ends" ('rA7, clear suggestion" of Pindar's language. Cf. also L. Illig, Zuir Form d. pind. Erz. 36: "In der Wendung XEpa7TpOUEVEYKEFV kommt mit jener sinnlichen Anschaulichkeit, die der ganzen Darstellungen V. 26-37 eigen ist, die Gewaltsamkeit einer solchen Vereinigung ebenso zum Ausdruck wie in der entsprechenden Wendung bei Homer, II.

But Agamemnon says simply that he has never slept with Briseis: cf. the parallel passage at 9. I 3 3: ,U7To7E rt1S E&amp;vV1s EIrtL7'- /JyEVaL L ,utyr-vaL. That is the only assurance that might satisfy Achilles. It must be significant also that the "touch" (e'Oaots) of Zeus by which Io conceived Epaphus, so far from implying violence, could be imagined by Aeschylus (SUpp1. 40-48, 3Is) as a breath (6 E'. tr7rvolaS). Similarly, touch is non-violent, though erotic, in two occur- rences in Pyth. 9 itself (ii and I20). C. A. P. Ruck and W. H. Matheson, Pindar: Selected Odes (Ann Arbor, Michigan i968) 2II believe that Apollo and Cheiron are "bantering about the relative virtues of rape and seduction" and find that this exchange " provides a light tone". I3 Both Apollo's question (oria, 36) and Cheiron's answer (ova 0EtktLO'v, 42) are made in terms of holiness. What this implies for the union of the god and the nymph is set forth in Cheiron's prophecy of her destiny and is symbolised in the Jparav als&amp;i (I2) that Aphrodite sheds over the pair.

Their influence on man is swift, as in the occurrence of love, the achievement of excellence, or even in the delivery of their children.I7 In a famous simile of the Iliad their swiftness of movement is likened, by a rare comparison, to that of thought itself.I8 It is therefore in no way remarkable that they are said to be swift also in love.I9 Nowhere in this theme is there a necessary suggestion of violence 20 and there is no more implied in our passage of the Ninth Pythian than in its echo at the end of the ode (I I4) in the 'Kv5TaTov yyacov of the daughters of Danaus or in the marriage of Alexidamus to the daughter of the Libyan Antaeus. The theme of speed, which recurs throughout the poem,2' is not only romantically but also theologically just. To attribute to Pindar the situation as conceived by current interpre- tations is to confuse his easy relationship with traditional religion with the quite different attitudes of the sophistic enlightenment. If it could be shown that Pindar viewed such matters with the eyes of Euripides,22 it would be possible to speak of Cheiron's reply to what has been called "Apollo's somewhat fast proposition."23 As it is, it is quite I4 Cf.

The main structure is clear enough: there is first a chiastic connection between concealment and openness (Kpv-r7at' anid a&amp;uav&amp;dv ...), secondly another between wisdom and aidds (orooas and at8Eovr'), and lastly parallel enldings on the origins of love (KAa8EsE... uooqs IletOovs tEpav tAo-ra'rcov and a&amp;Etas UrvXEtv -ro Trp6rov EUvacsL). The image is no more difficult to make visual: Peitho is the holder of the keys (KA,o03Xos) of the shrine of the holy loves. Eros perfornms a similar function in a parallel passage of Euripides (Hipp. 540; cf Aristoph. Eccl. 976). Peitho must therefore be the attendant of Aphrodite, who is familiar in lyric verse and in fine art24 and embodies the attraction of love.25 Although her function here has been regularly mis- understood, it is readily explained, if attention is given to the structure of the passage. Cheiron is concerned with the beginlnings of love26 24 Cf. Sappho fr. 96.26-29; 200 L-P; Ibycus fr. 7: 288 PMG; Pind. Pyth. 4.2I9 and fr. I22.2 Snell; Aesch. Stippl. 1034-42.

In that connection Peitho, who is love's motive power, is more appropriate than Eros himself, who serves in the Euripidean version. The identity of Peitho is established by the closely-woven context of the Centaur's wise saying; there is no need of external references.27 Peitho is said also to be wise, or skilful, in the use of her keys and this virtue is symmetrically matched in the passage by the aid6s shown by gods and men alike about openly beginning love-making. The aidos of gods and men, one infers, is part of the cro'a of Peitho. The attraction exercised by love could never succeed in moving a young lover to begin if he had not the protection of aid6s.zS The keys used by Peitho must be kept hidden and openness both in word and in deed avoided in a first love. There aidds is the rule and the fact.29 Aidos is a special virtue of the youthful in Homer and in archaic literature.30 In the Odyssey, for example, it takes the form of respect for elders in the case of Telemachus and of modest circumspection with men in the case of Nausicaa. Whereas Telemachus is inhibited from approaching Nestor and asking him questions, Nausicaa cannot bring 27 As (e.g.) by L. Illig, Zur Form d. pind. Erz. 37: "Der Sinn dieser implizite gegebenen Antwort ist klar: Apollon wird und kann nicht seiner Begierde sogleich hier im Tal vor der H6hle des Chiron folgen;" or by R. P. Winnington-Ingram in BICS i6 (I969) io-i I: "But peitho implies its opposite, which is bia (or ananke); and violence has already been suggested, first by apiraa' (6) and now by the XE`pa 70rpoEVEyKEtv of the god's question (36). Apollo must woo Cyrene, not rape her." Winnington-Ingram thinks (I2-I3) of a connection with Aeschylus' Danaid trilogy. 28 Cheiron's wisdom thus offers a commentary on the image of sparav a8co (I2) shed by Aphrodite on Apollo and Cyrene. 29 It is satisfactory to notice that the scholiasts (2.227 Drachmann), who are slighted by modern interpreters of the passage, were on the right lines on this point: 4E'7TE aiaXvv- otLLEOa 7rEpt -rovrcowv AE'yEWV Kat KpJ7TTw(tS rai6-ra EvEpyEtrat, Kat av at8ov1bEvos /IE EpOris.

I53 ff., where we find many of the same elements used in an erotic context, though for the purpose of seduction. There is mention (I68) of a KAt8L Kpv7Tr- of Hera's chamber, of persuasion, love, and at'8s9 (208-2I0, where this last is, however, of a different kind), of the need for privacy and the fear of v4EYLEats (330-40). 30 See the general study of C.

Finally, Euripides' Hippolytus, in a famous speech (Hipp. 73 ff.), speaks of a pure meadow, ungrazed and unmown, which is tended by a gardener, who is Aid6s, for the sake of those in whom sophrosyne is inborn. Both of these traditional forms of aid6s, respect for age and shyness about sex, are likely to be felt by Pindar's Apollo, but it is the latter that is in question here and is the subject of Cheiron's instruction. In offering advice to the god on this subject the Centaur recognises the traditional place of aid6s in good breeding.35 His general point made, Cheiron next turnls to its application to Apollo: Ka' yap aEs, Tiov ov OE(Jov VEv8EL OLyEW ETpa7cTE ,eLAtxos- opya 7Tapba/LEv TOV- Tov Ao'yov.

The verb -a'poa)u and the lnouln -pTapacts, as used by Pindar, are not distinctly subjective (lying) nor objective (false statement). As often in archaic verse, such a distinction is not to be pressed. But it is undeniable that what Cheiron asserts here is the god's omlniscience and it is implied that what he denies is his ignorance, not his untruth- fulness. He discovers a discrepancy between the god's questions and his omniscience, and he understands the cause. Apollo, he says, has been under the psychological influence (E'Wpa-rE) of a EAtXoS- opya.37 Two recent interpretations reveal current understalnding of the phrase. Mr R. W. B. Burton takes it to refer to Apollo's passionate mood, or impulse, or feeling, whereas Professor R. P. Winllington- Ingram prefers "pleasant humour." 38 Passion or playfulness has induced Apollo to belie his own omniscience. Cheiron's attitude is then one of worldly connivance or light-hearted humour (possibly mixed with deprecation). But neither, as has been seen, catches the tone of Pindar or of the passage; the wise saying of Cheiron, just interpreted, becomes irrelevant; 39 and the phrase itself does not easily yield the required mlieaning, as will appear. atpy is "temper," "disposition," "feelings," "impulses." 40 To judge by the closest parallel, Isthml. 2.3 5-36 (opyav . . . yAVKEtav), this entity is objectively rather than subjectively viewed, for there Xeno- crates is praised, not for his inner pleasures or content, but for the pleasure that he gave to others.4' On this analogy ELAtXOS oapy&amp; should not be expected to signify the experience of one's own passion. 37On ('Epa7rE, cf., e.g., II. 6.6I; I0.45; Od. 3.I47; I9.479; Anacreon fr. 30: 375 PMG; Theognis 379; Pind. Isthm. 3.I0. 38 See R. W. B. Burton, Pindar's Pyth. Odes 4I; R. P. Winnington-Ingram in BICS i6 (I969) I0. Other versions, though differing in form, show the same division: "some genial humor" (Lattimore); " the honey-sweetness of your mood" (Bowra); " a merry mood" (Farnell); "thy pleasant mood" (Sandys); "quelque souriante fantaisie" Croiset); "un doux caprice" (Meautis); "un aimable caprice" (Puech); "come in- genium" (Boeckh); "eine freundliche Stimmung" (Illig); "eine zartliche Wallung" (Werner); " verliebte Laune " (Welcker); " thy soft desire " (Myers); " the blandishments of lust" (Ruck and Matheson). 39 But Cheiron's KacL yap or' (42) explicitly makes the passage an application of the piece of wisdom that precedes. 40 See W.

I.30: Xapts 8' aL7TEp c7cravracLEvXEt i-d 1LLELAtXa Ovaro-s. It is Xapts, joy and pleasure, who makes all things uEItAtXa for mortal men.43 There is nothing in the word's usage to signify clearly a passionate experience. "Pleasant mood," on the other hand, is ambiguous. If it signifies a mood that gives pleasure to others, it is an acceptable parallel to opyacv ... yAVKEtav. But it seems to be intended to bear a different sense, which may be rephrased as "a mood of pleasantry:"44 Cheiron is thought to detect a joke. The requirements of the context aside, this meaning does not fit tkE1AtXXos, which denotes gentle and soothing pleasures, not humorous or ironic diversions. The word is too simple to bear the complex sense desired. In the first sense "pleasant mood," or better "pleasant disposition," is acceptable, but, if an attempt at humour is excluded, we still have not discovered what is so described. I suggest that the uEItA?Xos o3pya is the aid6s that was the burden of Cheiron's piece of wisdom.45 Nothing could be more soothingly and agreeably pleasing to others than actions that show a consciousness of shame in their presence and respect for their judgments. In fact the phrase a'oZ kEAutXA occurs both in Homer and in Hesiod,46 the combination of ideas is found in a 42 W. Schmid, Geschichte der griechischen Literatur i.i (Munich I929) 602 and note Io seeks to find an erotic sense in juELALXos in Pyth. 9.43. His suggestion is favourably received by R. W. B. Burton, Pindar's Pyth. Odes 4I. 43 For the association of Xapts with al&amp;Os, cf. Pind. 01. 6.76; 7.89; Hom.H.Cer. 2I4-2I5; Theognis I33I. Also with 17EHC': Pind. fr. I23.I4 Snell3; Hes. Op. 73; Ibycus fr. 7: 288 PMG. 44 According to L. Illig, Zur Form d. pind. Erz. 37-38, 43, Cheiron does not take Apollo's apparently brutal questions seriously. Pindar's purpose, on this view, is not to describe psychology but to dismiss an embarrassing incident in his source, the Hesiodic Ehoiai. 45 Once again a scholiast (2.227 Drachmann) is found to offer corroboration: q' al&amp;bs ETrot7uE aUE rov 1tavtv rwvv0dvOaEaL. 46 Od. 8.I72 and Hes. Theog. 92. The phrase is clearly part of the literary tradition, but the relation between the two passages is disputed. In favour of the priority of the Odyssey, see C. E. von Erffa, AIJQZ 45-47; F. Solmsen in TAPA 85 (I954) I0-I3, and G. P. Edwards, The Language of Hesiod (Oxford I97I) I68-69; in favour of that of the Theogony, see U. von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Die Ilias und Homer2 (Berlin I920) 477-78, and M. L.

He does not laugh at Apollo's joke, nor dismiss his question as lacking in seriousness, nor urge restraint upon a rufflanly pupil.49 He explains to Apollo what is happening to him, showing delight in the god's deference and modesty during the first flush of passion and an amused sense of his own predicament as teacher of an omniscient divinity.50 The god's aid6s, which is the right and natural accompaniment of first love, has diverted him from his own omniscience.5' Cheiron's explanation, like his manner of giving it, shows him to be benign, understanding, tactful, and wise. His pupil's ,uEtA Xos dpyd has made him ,uLEA?Xov.52 His laughter, whatever its precise nature, must have been moved by the same spirit.53 The picture of the god as a young and modest pupil of a wise teacher is refreshingly unselfconscious in its candid anthropomorphism. Apollo, though the god of prophecy, behaves with the circumspection 47 Od. 3.96 and 4.326: k8E' it /t' at8o'uEvos LEtAlauEo 8' EAEat`pwv; Hes. Theog. 80-93: the Muses send to flaaLAi,Es at'oZot the gift of speech, so that ETrEa /iELALXa flow from their mouths. Peitho', which is closely connected with aid6s in Cheiron's speech in Pyth. 9, is a yA(aaUrjs 4Zs- /ELALEy/La at Aesch. Eumn. 886. 48 Sp1y by itself may signify either a desirable or an undesirable quality and from the date of Aeschylus' Oresteia is frequently found in the sense, "anger." It may be opposed to at'Mcs, as in Eur. fr. 746 N2: alA&amp;s, yap opyiss rAdLov' (xK,bEAEL /porovs. In Pyth. 9.43, therefore, uELALXos bears the weight of the phrase. This contextual coloration is in Pindar's manner: see Pyth. I.89: EvZav0E 8' E'v cpya; 4.I4I: 0qLuuaaajE'vovs 'pycs; Isthm. 5.34: puEyaAr-ropEs opyat; as well as Isthm. 2.35-36. 49 On the attitudes attributed to Apollo, Cheiron, and Pindar by the commentators, see L. Illig, Ztir Form d. pind. Erz. 3 8 ff. and R. W. B. Burton, Pindar's Pyth. Odes 40. 50 B. L. Gildersleeve, Pindar 342. Gildersleeve, however, under the influence of XAtapo'v (38), speaks of "the half-smile of the great teacher." Cf. Pyth. 3.I if., 45 f., 63 ff.: 4.I02 ff. St In addition to other constraints, aid6s is often said to inhibit speech: see pp. 568 above and Theognis II79-80, Aesch. Choeph. 665-66, fr. 225.I2 Mette. It may over- ride judgment, as in II. I0.234-39. 52. That the expected effect of E'irEa jELALXa is to produce a like response is shown negatively by II.

In principle, it is credible that language prompted by a EL'AXosX o&amp;pya' consists of c'zrEa FLdALXa; in fact, Cheiron uses of it the verb 7rapc OajuEv, which is regularly used of winning, as well as false, speech. See II. I2.249; Od. 2.I89, I6.287, I9.6; Hes. Theog. go; Parm. B I.I5 VS. 53 The smile that Athena bestows on Odysseus at Od. I3.287 is a similar recognition of affinity, but in trickery rather than in respect for age and wisdom.</page><page sequence="13">Vol. I03] APOLLO S FIRST LOVE 573 of a well-bred youth who falls in love for the first time. The candour of his passion identifies him as a male and a god, but in his deference to his teacher and to the code of manners in which he has been reared, he is the counterpart of Nausicaa herself. Whereas her aid6s prevented her, no matter what her feelings, from speaking to her father of marriage, he was impelled by the same motive, in spite of the heat of passion, to ask the wise Centaur whether the satisfaction of his desires was right and proper. The full humanity of the god, I conceive, was as important to Pindar, and to traditional belief, as his august knowledge and power, but it was an adornment rather than an embarrassment for him to be moved by aid6s. Apollo's omniscience could not be refractory to Cheiron's tutelage, for the wisdom of the mentor of heroes was the same as the knowledge of the god. By the time of Pindar's death the main intellectual movements in Greece were eroding the base upon which such beliefs and attitudes were built. In particular, the radical distinction between nomos and physis was to destroy for many, in addition to other things, the pos- sibility of contemplating the naturalness of aidds either in gods or in men.54 The resulting turmoil in thought and society is reflected on the one hand in the attack on aidds as part of the old education in Aristophanes' Clouds and on the other in Euripides' merciless on- slaughts on anthropomorphism. From that time Greek poetry lost the capacity that it had for so long possessed of encompassing all things, both human and divine, in a single, freshly visual imagination. Our appreciation of Pindar's achievement in the Ninth Pythian is enhanced by awareness of an innocence that was soon to be lost forever. 54On the decline of aidos from the fourth century, see G. Murray, Rise of the Greek Epic3 89-92. The attempt by conservatives like Plato and Isocrates to revive it is pointed out by W. Jaeger, Paideia2 3.122, 226 with 340 note 8S.</page></plain_text>
