SPECIAL RESEARCH FORUM CALL FOR PAPERS: BUILDING EFFECTIVE NETWORKS The Academy of Management Journal is pleased to announce a call for papers for the Special Re- search Forum on Building Effective Networks. The guest editors are Anne S. Tsui (Hong Kong Univer- sity of Science and Technology), Joseph Ga- laskiewicz (University of Arizona), Henrich R. Greve (Norwegian School of Management, BI), and Wenpin Tsai (Pennsylvania State University). The deadline for submissions is March 15, 2003. Overview The theme for the 2002 Academy of Management annual meeting is "building effective networks." This theme-examining and understanding the what, why, and how of building effective net- works-has been a topic of strong scholarly interest among both organizational sociologists and psy- chologists. Yet changes in the past few decades have made networks strategically more important and pervasive today than they have ever been be- fore. Consider the advent of the Internet (one of the world's biggest networks), quantum advances in other means and modes of telecommunication, and continued globalization of the world economy. It is now possible to form networks that link phenome- nal numbers of people, organizations, and systems in disparate corners of the world at an alarming rate and speed. People from far corners of the world now regularly work together in virtual teams on various types of projects, often across firm bound- aries. The ability to be part of an influential net- work has often been cited as a source of competi- tive advantage for people and organizations alike. In recent years, network theory, network analy- sis, and social capital theory have gained increased attention in organizational research and practice. Social capital theory has focused on the costs and benefits that networks produce at the individual, group, and organizational levels. From a gender perspective, the existence of "old boy networks" has been used to account for the predominance of men at the senior levels of most organizational hierarchies. From an ethnic perspective, the finan- cial and professional achievements attained by many Chinese outside of their homelands have been attributed, in part at least, to the existence of the Chinese diaspora. From the cross-national standpoint, the Japanese keiretsus and Korean chaebols have been credited as contributing to the economic miracles attained by both Japan and Ko- rea over the past several decades. More recently, however, both keiretsus and chaebols have come under closer scrutiny and have been faulted as sources of weaknesses in both economies, suggest- ing the potential downsides of intense networks. In their quest to thrive, or even survive, in an intensely competitive global economy, nations, firms, and individuals have engaged in building effective networks. Nations have joined together to form economic unions and/or regional trading blocs. These include the European Union (EU), the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the Asia-Pacific Economic Council (APEC). Companies have been entering into all forms of international cooperative agreements with each other in record numbers. Furthermore, such strate- gic networks are no longer confined to firms in similar or related industries, but are increasingly formed across sectors that hitherto appeared to be unrelated. To facilitate this trend toward global networks, new organizational forms and structures have been proposed. These include the boundary- less organizations propounded by Jack Welch at General Electric and the "pizza chart organization" advocated at Eastman Chemical. Individuals have found that collaborative skills and networking abil- ities are highly prized by organizations seeking to become or remain world class. Rosabeth Kanter, for example, has called for the development of cosmo- politans who are rich in the "three Cs": concepts, competencies, and connections. Ikujiro Nonaka and others have argued for the need to foster knowledge activists who are capable of spanning organizational boundaries to facilitate the absorp- tion, transfer, and exchange of technology. Organi- zational learning and knowledge creation are in- creasingly viewed in social terms. For example, John Seely Brown's book, The Social Life of Infor- mation, is based on the network concept. Today, there appears to be no means of escaping the spread and implications of networks of different types and forms as they are so closely interwoven into every aspect of daily existence. Research Topics and Questions This special research forum aims to stimulate research that results in a comprehensive and thor- ough understanding of the nature of networks- 471</page><page sequence="6">Academy of Management Journal why they exist, the dynamics associated with their formation and perpetuation, and the implications of networks for individuals, groups, firms, and na- tions. We invite papers that address networks, used in the broadest context of the term, and their im- plications for management in general. The list be- low is a small sampling of the topics that might be addressed: * How can network concepts be used as a diagnos- tic tool and/or a means for implementing organi- zational change? * How do networks relate to social capital, and what is the relationship between networks-based social capital and outcomes for an individual or a firm? * What are the positive and negative elements as- sociated with different types and forms of net- works? * How do networks affect an organization's ability to generate new knowledge and/or facilitate the transfer of knowledge among its members? * What is the impact of digital networks on organ- izational functioning and behavior? * What types of organizational structures facilitate the development and implementation of effec- tive networks? * Do the formation of networks and their dynamics differ across countries? For example, how do guanxi (connections) in Confucian societies dif- fer from networking in the West? * What factors can contribute to the successful formation and smooth functioning of global net- works? * What conditions allow networks of peoples from different cultural backgrounds to function effec- tively? * How do networks at a firm level affect outcomes at unit or individual levels, and how do net- works at an individual level affect outcomes at unit or firm levels? * How can networks and associations formed for nonbusiness purposes, such as religious wor- ship, recreation, fellowship, and so forth foster the development of business networks or influ- ence business decision making? Although we embrace a broad definition of net- works in this research forum and welcome studies with creative ideas and methodologies, we are in- terested in organizational and managerial implica- tions of new network concepts and applications. Papers that discuss network analytical techniques without offering significant theoretical contribu- tions or that focus on model specifications of neu- ral networks are outside the domain of this research forum.

STYLE GUIDE FOR AUTHORS This "Style Guide for Authors" covers the for- mat and language to use when preparing manu- scripts for the Academy of Management Journal (AMJ). A different document, "Information for Contributors" (front of each issue or http://aom. pace.edu/amj/submission.html) describes desir- able content. Manuscript Submission and Length Submit manuscripts electronically to the editor at amjtlee@u.washington.edu. Follow the "Instructions for Electronic Submission" (http://aom.pace.edu/ amj/electronic.html). Full articles should not ordinarily exceed 40 manuscript pages, including references, appen- dixes, tables, and figures. Research notes should not ordinarily exceed 25 pages. Manuscript Format AMJ is not printed directly from your file. Ac- cepted manuscripts are copy-edited and retyped. You can help this process go smoothly by following these steps: Type and spacing. Use at least 12-point type. Double-space references, endnotes, appendixes, ta- bles, and figures. Double-space everything except quotes more than seven lines long. Indent these as a block. Use wide margins of an inch or more. Don't vary type size-stick with 12-point. Never underline; use italic (for occasional emphasis; names of books and periodicals; certain statistics; and as illustrated under "Citations" and "References," below). Do not use bold type (except for vectors). Saving. When you save your file, use the option "Embed true-type fonts" (pull down "tools," go to "general options"). Put in hard page breaks be- tween parts of the manuscript, as described in "Back Pages," below. Front Pages Your title page is page 1. Please number it. Address. Under the title of your work, list au- thors' names, affiliations, and complete addresses and contact numbers. Example: AN EXCETTJ.ENT STUDY A. MANAGEMENT SCHOLAR Famous University Special Department Building and/or Street City, State, Zip Code Tel: (000) 000-0000 Fax: (000) 000-0000 e-mail: scholar@fam.edu The details of your address will not appear in AMJ, but we need them to keep in touch with you. Keep the editor's office informed about job changes and long absences. Acknowledgment. If you wish to acknowledge financial support or other assistance, add a note (double-spaced) at the bottom of page 1. Abstract. Your abstract and the title of the work go on page 2. Your abstract should be about 75 words long. Back Pages Group any endnotes, references, appendixes, ta- bles, and figures at the end of your manuscript. Continue your page numbering. Put hard page breaks between these parts. For instance, the refer- ences should begin on a new page, and every table should begin on a new page. Headings and Sections AMJ uses only three levels of headings. Main headings designate your major sections, three or four main headings should be enough in most cases. Center your main headings and type them in all capitals. Example: METHODS Second-level headings follow. Type these flush with the left margin, beginning only major words with capitals. Examples: Data and Sample Indent third-level headings. Begin the first word with a capital, end the heading with a period, and continue with your text. Example: Manager sample. Respondents consisted of a random sample of 300 managers... First sample: Bank managers. Respondents consist- ed... 473</page><page sequence="8">Academy of Management Journal The headings indicate a hierarchy of sections. Sections with main headings precede those with second-level headings, which precede those with third-level headings. Do not skip a step and launch directly into a section with a second-level heading. When you divide a section, use two' or more subsections. For instance, a main section needs at least two second-level sections (or none). Second- level sections should be at least a page long. Hypotheses Begin each hypothesis on its own indented line. Fully and separately state each hypothesis you tested separately. Give it a distinct number or num- ber-letter label. Example: Hypothesis la. Concise writing has a positive relation- ship to publication. Hypothesis lb. Following AMJ's "Style Guide for Au- thors" has a positive relationship to publication. Special Words Technical terms. Help your work to be accessible to AMJ's wide-ranging readership. Define key tech- nical terms, both conceptual and analytical ones. A technical term is a word that is not in a general-use dictionary with the meaning you (or even you and other published scholars) ascribe to it. Quotes can replace defining for technical terms that are not key to your work. Abbreviations. Avoid using abbreviations for the names of concepts. Use ordinary words for variable names-not code names or other abbreviations. Use the same name for a variable throughout your text, tables, figures, and appendixes. Endnotes Do not use footnotes-use endnotes. Please use these sparingly, and keep them short. Double-space endnotes in 12-point type so that they will be easy to copy edit and typeset. The printer will shrink them. Math Do not "talk in math" in regular text. Use words. For instance, "We surveyed 100 employees," not "We surveyed n = 100 employees" and "We used chi-squares to evaluate coefficients," not "We used X2S." You can report statistical results using symbols in parentheses. And, unlike the rest of your manu- script, results in parens and equations should be formatted as thoroughly as possible. Use italic as customary-for p, r, b, F, z, and so forth. Use bold italic for vectors; use Greek letters and other needed symbols. Display and number only equations you mention again in your work. Sexist and Biased Language Avoid language that might be interpreted as den- igrating to ethnic or other groups. Be particularly careful in dealing with gender, where long-estab- lished customs, such as the use of "he" as a generic pronoun ("a manager . . he"), can imply gender- based discrimination. Using plural pronouns- changing "the manager... he" to "managers... they"-usually helps. Active Voice and First Person Put sentences in the active voice ("I did it"; "They did it") instead of the passive voice ("It was done") to make it easy for readers to see who did what. Use the first person ("I" or "we") to describe what you yourself did: Two items were found to lack factor validity by Earley (1989). [Passive] Earley (1989) found that two items lacked factor validity. [Active] The author developed three new items. [third person] I developed three new items. [first person] Anthropomorphism Avoid describing inanimate entities (models, theories, firms, and so forth) as acting in ways only humans can act. Tables and Figures Useful tables and figures do not duplicate the text; they supplement and clarify it. Because tables and figures are more expensive to prepare for pub- lication than text, please carefully consider what each adds to your work. For each table or figure, center "TABLE" or "FIG- URE" with a number (1, 2, etc.) at the top of the page. Put the title under this, also centered at the top. Number tables and figures consecutively (one se- ries for tables, one for figures). Group your tables and figures at the end of the manuscript as de- scribed under "Back Pages" above. Indicate the po- sition of each in the text as follows: 474 April</page><page sequence="9">Volume 45, Number 2 Insert Table 2 about here Each table or figure must have a sentence in your text that introduces it. Tables Look at tables in published AMJs that report the type of analysis you are reporting. Imitate them. But use more than one page if you need to. Do not squeeze material onto one page. Our basic table principle is that each table should report one type of analysis (which is identified in the title) and each vertical column and horizontal row should contain only one type of data. Label what you are presenting across the top or down the side-not in the body. For variable names, use ordinary words, not abbreviations, and avoid parentheses. Report only two decimal places for statistics. In correlation matrixes, the correlations should fill the lower-left corner of the table. For general footnotes to tables, use superscript small letters. Significance levels can be summarized in a let- tered footnote ("aAll values greater than ...."). Or use this format, with every level on a separate line: tp&lt; .10 * p&lt;.05 ** p&lt; .01 *** p&lt; .001 Figures Figures (unlike tables) have graphics. Our printer scans in figures directly from your manuscript. So make sure your figures will print out crisp and clear. Avoid "stacking"-write all words horizontally, not vertically. Use the same variable names you use in the text. Do not abbreviate. Look at figures in published AMJs for format ideas. Citations Citations are your in-text identifications of other research. Minimize self-citations that would reveal your manuscript's authorship. Doing this is impor- tant for protecting the double-blind review process. To cite, enclose authors' names and the year of a work in parentheses. Example: Several studies (Adams, 1974; Brown &amp; Hales, 1975, 1980; Collins, 1976a, 1976b) support this conclusion. Order citations alphabetically. Two or more works by one author (or by an identical group of authors) published in the same year should have "a," "b," etc., added after the year. If a work has no human author(s), cite the peri- odical it is in as the author: (Wall Street Journal, 1990) or cite the "corporate author" that produced it: "... forecasts of increasing service jobs in the U.S. Industrial Outlook (U.S. Department of Com- merce, 1992)... To cite a direct quotation, give pages after the year, separated from it by a colon. Example: Adams has said that writing a book is "a long and arduous task" (1974: 3). Also cite page numbers when you paraphrase or summarize others' specific arguments or findings. If a work has two authors, give both names every time you cite it. For three through six authors, give all names the first time, then use "et al." Examples: Few field studies use random assignment (Foster, Whittington, Tucker, Horner, Hubbard, &amp; Grimm, 2000). (first citation) ... even when random assignment is not possible (Foster et al., 2000). (subsequent citation) For seven or more authors, use "et al." even for the first citation. (But the matching reference should give all the authors.) References References are your entries in the alphabetical list at the end of your article or research note. This list includes only work you have cited. Alphabetize references by the last name of a sole author, a first author, or an editor, or by the name of a corporate author (for instance, U.S. Census Bureau) or periodical (such as the Wall Street Journal) if there is no human author or editor. Order works by an identical author by year of publication, listing the earliest first. If the years of publication are also the same, differen- tiate entries by adding small letters ("a," "b," etc.) after the years. Repeat author's name for each entry. Book entries follow this form: Authors' or Ed- itors' Last Names, Initials. Year. Title of book.
