<plain_text><page sequence="1">Robin Ridington THE INNER EYE OF and SHAMANISM AND Tonia Ridington TOTEMISM Levi-Strauss has shown us that totemism is not an institution but a way of thought. For this if for nothing else we should be eternally grateful. But knowing the dialectical structure of totemic thought alone is incomplete without a knowledge of its meaning. Totemic symbols are not merely syllogistic but refer to a systematic con- ceptualization of natural, psychic, and cultural reality that in mythically oriented traditions can best be called a cosmic struc- ture (a term I have borrowed from a paper by Susan Reid on the meaning of Kwakiutl ceremonialism).1 Mythical cosmologies are not the attempts of savages to explain in fantasy where empirical knowledge of reality is absent, but are rather the opposite-statements in allegorical form about knowl- edge of the interrelations between what we would call natural (ob- jective), psychic (psychological), and cultural (learned adaptational) aspects of reality. Myth and science are polar opposites, not be- cause one is wrong and the other right, but because myth portrays Our only role has been to put the words of this essay together. To the extent that they fall short of representing the way things are we accept responsibility and ask for your patience. The ideas we have attempted to communicate belong to every- one. In particular we have learned with and from David Jongeward, Susan Reid, and Sandra Slind, members of a seminar on myth at the University of British Columbia. The Beaver Indians and their shaman, Charlie Yahey, are, of course, our real teachers. We have been learning from them since 1964. The works of Mircea Eliade have also been immensely important in preparing the path. 1 Susan Reid, "A Methodological Inquiry into the Nature of Kwakiutl Cere- monialism" (unpublished manuscript, Department of Anthropology, University of British Columbia, 1969). 49</page><page sequence="2">Inner Eye of Shamanism and Totemism reality as it is experienced while science postulates a reality that is thought to exist but can never be experienced. Myth unveils what is known to be true, while science experiments to build realities that are thought not to be untrue. Myths through their symbols allow men to enter directly and experientially into the realm of meaningful reality, and totemism is a form of symbolic communication that categorically associates human experience with its objects. Totemic symbols are good to experience as well as good to think. That they are sometimes, but not always, good to eat is simply to say that there are other experiences than eating. The eagle is not only a symbol of high as opposed to low; it is also a bird. The Hidatsa who go eagle hunting, to refer to an example of totemic classification used by Levi-Strauss,2 undergo an ex- perience of great power. The eagles that they lure from the sky and capture by hand are more than convenient abstractions. They, and through them the hunter, are participants in the cosmic struc- ture of meaningful experience. There is more meaning to eagle hunting than its formal intellectual structure. Mythic and totemic systems reveal to men a cosmic structure that synthesizes and organizes their individual and collective ex- periences. They do not "give meaning" to life but rather disclose the meaning that is its intrinsic property. The cosmic structure most often if not universally associated with myth and totem can be loosely described as shamanic. The essential axes of this structure are the four cardinal points and a central vertical axis passing through their point of intersection that connects the three worlds of sky, earth, and underworld. The structure is that of a mandala whose center leads to a break in space and time3 that generates upper and lower supernatural worlds. They exist in a dimension apprehended through inner experience. The North-South and East- West axes encompass the manifest world of ordinary reality (see Carlos Castaneda for discussion of ordinary and nonordinary reality)4 and their point of intersection is the entrance to the super- natural upper and underworlds. The central vertical axis that connects the three worlds is variously symbolized as the world pole, the tree of life, the sacred mountain, the central house pole, Jacob's ladder, and even the church steeple.5 2 Claude Levi-Strauss, The Savage Mind (Chicago, 1966), p. 50. 3 See Mircea Eliade, The Sacred and the Profane (New York, 1957), and Shaman- ism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy, Bollingen Series, no. 76 (New York, 1964). 4 Carlos Castaneda, The Teachings of Don Juan (Berkeley, Calif., 1968). 5 For a detailed description of shamanic cosmology, see Eliade, Shamanism, chap. 8. 50</page><page sequence="3">History of Religions Shamanism is usually described as a magical flight into a super- natural realm. But what do we really mean when we speak of supernatural realms? Surely we do not still believe that savages imagine nonexistent worlds because of their poor understanding of physical reality. The real meaning of the supernatural must be symbolic and the shamanic flight an inner journey into a realm of experience for which the symbols stand. The three worlds of a shamanic cosmology are not geographical places but internal states of being represented by a geometric analogy. The shaman does not really fly up or down, but inside to the meaning of things. Shamanism is a magical flight into a hidden, internal, experiential dimension in which time, space, and distance as we know them, as well as the distinction between subject and object, merge into a unity. In fact, shamanism so defined is a universal human experi- ence even though it tends to be institutionalized only in small- scale "savage" societies. As L6vi-Strauss has brilliantly shown, the geometrical axes of shamanic cosmology can be used as the basis of endless elegant structural oppositions, mediations, and syntheses. The point I wish to illustrate is that the mental structure of totemism is simply a framework for the cosmic structure of shamanism. Totemism is an intellectual abstraction of one element from the universe of sham- anic meaning. I do not mean to attempt an exhaustive cross- cultural exercise in scientific validation of this point (although Eliade's monumental book on shamanism has laid much of the groundwork), but would rather illustrate it with a single example from my own field experience among a shamanic and totemic people, the Beaver Indians of northeastern British Columbia. BEAVER COSMIC STRUCTURE6 The Beaver myth of creation begins with the creator God, Yagesatz (that which is motionless in heaven), who draws a cross upon the primeval waters. It is this cross that fixes the middle earth and determines its qualities. Horizontally the cross defines the cardinal points or quarters of the earth: East, South, West, and North. Vertically its center is to become the link between the upper and underworlds. (Fig. 1 is a Beaver drawing of their cosmos, showing the cross and the roads leading into the supernatural realms at its center. Fig. 2 is the authors' conceptualization of 6 Based on Beaver myths, stories, shamanic texts, and unpublished field notes compiled betweeen 1964 and 1968. 51</page><page sequence="4">Inner Eye of Shamanism and Totemism FIG. 1.-Design on Beaver shaman's drum showing the world of the four quarters and the two inner supernatural worlds. the qualities symbolically associated with the four quarters. The following discussion explicates the symbolism of these structural diagrams.) Each direction is defined by a color, a time of day, a season, a sex, and a quality. The East is red, dawn, spring, birth, male, and benevolent. The South is yellow, noon, summer, infancy, female, and benevolent. The West is red, dusk, fall, female, and dangerous. The North is white, night, winter, male, and dangerous. The se- quence of the directions embodies the sequence of the day, of the seasons which make up the year, and the stages of life which make up the youth of man. The East is the place where the sun comes out "from behind the mountains," bringing the beginning of day- the dawn, which is red in color. It is the time of day of the begin- 52</page><page sequence="5">History of Religions NORTH dangerous male winter ,o WEST EAST dangerous birth and female rebirth menstrual good blood male fall \ / animal and \ / 0 /f childbirth blood O~~ ~~~~~~~~~\ ^ ^ / "spring O0D good female summer SOUTH FIG. 2.-Some Beaver totemic associations ning of warmth. By noon the sun has moved in an arc southward, and at its zenith it marks the South. It is bright yellow and warm. The West is the place where the sun "goes behind the mountains" at dusk, burning red. It is the beginning of the cold time of day. The North is the place where the moon is at its zenith in the night, when the sun has disappeared from earthly view. The white moon is the shadow or soul of the sun. The night is the time of cold when the shadows or souls of dead people roam the earth and can see. Thus the cross that Yagesati drew on the waters set in motion the succession of the days. At the same time it set in motion the succession of the seasons. The East is the bringer of spring, of the beginning of warmth, of the resurrection of the plants and the animals; for the place where the sun comes out from behind the mountains is also the place through which Yagesatz sends down the souls of animals (moose, caribou, deer, and so on) which are born in the spring. The East wind which 53</page><page sequence="6">Inner Eye of Shamanism and Totemism blows in the spring melts the ice and snow. It is brought back by the ducks and geese when they return from the South in spring. The South is the height of warmth which nourishes the plants, and hence the animals, and makes them grow. The South wind is warm, and when it blows in winter it suddenly gets warm, and the ice and snow disappear for a day or two. The West is the beginning of cold which kills the plants. The place where the sun "goes behind the mountains" is also the place through which the souls of animals which have been killed go back to heaven. The West and fall is the time and place of death. The West wind brings thunder and light- ning, tumult and downpours. It is brought by Thunderbird to destroy Snake. Fall is also the mating season for the animals. The North is the time of cold, when white snow and ice cover the dead leaves of fall. It is dangerous on the physical plane because the cold itself is killing and it is the hardest season in which to stay alive. The North wind is fierce and cold and brought by the under- world icebreaker monster. The Beavers see the succession of the four seasons associated with the four quarters as "two years," the cold half made up of fall and winter and the warm half made up of spring and summer. The warm half is benevolent, made of a long day and a short night; the cold half is dangerous, made of a long night and a short day. Each half is made up of a male and a female season, which implies a union and an issue which keeps the cycle turning round. The male and female seasons of the two halves are also of unequal lengths: the cold half has a short female part (fall) and a long male part (winter), male outweighs female; the warm half has a short male part (spring) and a long female part (summer), female out- weighs male, and so needs the opposite half of the year as a coun- terbalance. Each half also contains the other. The warm season has night; the cold season day. The red of fall, of death, of men- strual blood, recalls the opposite red of birth and childbirth. The white of the moon recalls the yellow of the full-bodied sun. During the cold season of fall and winter the sun comes from behind the mountains (or rises) and goes behind the mountains (or sets) close together toward the South, the benevolent warm place. During the warm season the sun rises and sets farther apart; more toward the North, the cold, dangerous zone. Each day from the summer solstice until the winter solstice the sun rises and sets along the periphery of the world one "chicken step" closer to the South. Each day from the winter solstice until the summer solstice the sun rises and sets, along the periphery of the world, one chicken step farther 54</page><page sequence="7">History of Religions North. The sunrise and the sunset move up and down the eastern and western quarters, reminding one that each season is tending toward the next. All this Yagesatz set in motion when he drew the cross on the waters. It symbolizes the dimensions within which Beaver experience takes place. At the same time the four quarters set in motion the sequence of stages of human development. The East symbolizes human birth, since the soul of the unborn child comes through the mountains at the same place as the sun and the souls of animals. The red of the East is also the blood of childbirth, and of killed animals, which is distinguished from the blood of menstruation. Although it is woman who gives birth, the East is male because the generative impulse is seen as male. Men as hunters give animals new life when they kill them. The South, the noontime, the summer of childhood, the Beavers identify with the period when the child is nursing, from birth until the birth of the next child when he is about two or three. On the human plane the warmth of the South is the warmth of the pro- tecting mother, whose milk makes the child grow as the sun nourishes plants and animals. It is a period when the mother, a female, is important and benevolent. In Freudian terms, this would be the oral stage. Then, as the child continues on in the cycle of life, his perception of his mother changes. She ceases to be the warm and nutrient female when she weans the child. This is the fall or sunset of the child's youth when the mother is seen as harmful and even killing. It is the season of the child's life when he first becomes aware of the power of sex and, being unready for it, sees it as a destructive force. During the rutting season the moose reinforce this image, for they go crazy and charge humans. The most negative aspects of a woman's sexuality come to the forefront. The red of the West is not only the sunset, but menstrual blood which kills. Indeed the mountains of the West, through which the sun goes down, are the body of a giant woman ("finish-people-between-the-legs") who, in the beginning of the world, used to lure people between her legs as she lay supine upon the ground. People would think they were walking in a valley between two long mountain ridges until they came to the juncture of the mountain ridges in the cave of her vagina and realized that they were trapped. Usakindji, the culture hero, killed the giant woman by throwing a huge rock into her vagina, and the West wind, which had lived in her womb, leaped up into the sky where it is today. But still the place of the West 55</page><page sequence="8">Inner Eye of Shamanism and Totemism and this stage of a child's life remain dangerous and female. In Freudian terms this is a special sort of Oedipal stage. After the initial shock of realization that the summer season of childhood is transformed into the horror of the nightfall stage, the child passes into the night, northern, winter stage of his life. As the fallen leaves of autumn are covered with snow, so the upheaval of the autumn of the child's life is submerged by the wisdom of the white-haired men. This is the time when the sages teach the child the myths of Yagesatz and Usakindji, and so prepare him to at- tempt a vision quest. It is a dangerous period because it is the period of the recovery from the symbolic death of fall, and the cure is not always easy. It is dangerous too because psychic forces mobilized in the child are like the North wind, severe, chilling, and even killing. To a certain extent it corresponds to the latency stage in Freud's outline of youth. As the winter season of the year passes, and spring returns, so does the winter of a child's youth pass. He has gone full circle. For life is not a straight line but a circle, an all-encompassing circle through which the child has passed and through which he will pass again and again, each day, each season, with each wife and each of his children. For each sunrise symbolizes all at once the rebirth of the sun, of the day, of warmth, of human and plant and animal life, of spring; as noontime recalls warmth and growth, early child- hood and summer; as sunset stands for death, menstruation, fire, destructive sex, and fall; and as night recalls the North, the cold, the difficult and dangerous. Each day each person relives the cycle of life. But after a child has passed through the four quarters of his life once, his direction is toward the center. The center of the axis which Yagesatz drew upon the water is the point where all the specific attributes of the four directions meet. The male and female, warm and cold, benevolent and harmful oppositions of the North-South, East-West axes are joined into one whole at the center. By having passed through the cycle of the four directions, the child is prepared to enter the center which is more than the coming together of all the earthly qualities, for these qualities themselves come down from the upper world and up from the underworld through this point. From this point they radiate out upon the surface of the earth, each to its appointed place. The center is the focal point of another axis as well, which fixes the cross on the earth. This is the axis which goes from the upper world through the center of the earth to the underworld. This is the axis of transcendence which is attained through the 56</page><page sequence="9">History of Religions vision quest and which constitutes the real rebirth of man. When Yagesatz drew the cross upon the water he also fixed the upright pole and hence the structure of the whole cosmos which is sym- bolized by the number seven. The seven is made up of the four directions; East, South, West, and North; the center; the zenith in heaven; and the nadir in the underworld. THE VISION QUEST The central experience to which Beaver symbols relate is found in the vision quest. Between weaning and puberty both boys and girls seek supernatural power from animal friends. This power is referred to as ma yine, literally, "its song," after the songs that are the cries of giant prototypical animals represented in myth. In the myths, the giant animals talk and live in camps like men. They are hunters and their prey are humans until a culture hero, the first shaman, transforms them into their present form. The cries and powers of these giant animals are the source of the super- natural power sought in the vision quest. In their vision quests, children actually live for a time apart from the world of men. They become, in effect, practicing etholo- gists, able to understand the behaviour and communications of animals and accepted by the animals because of their understand- ing and lack of fear. At the time of his vision quests, the Beaver's understanding is that of a child, immediate and participatory. It is a stage of developing independence, or rather, of transferring dependence from parents to animal protectors and thus identifying himself with the objects of his livelihood. It is a learning experience more than an initiation since he does not yet fully know the sym- bolic significance of his separation. Power can only be acquired between weaning and puberty, a time in which organic ties with the mother have been severed and sexual ties with a wife have not yet begun. The vision quest represents a developmental stage between the families of orientation and procreation. During this stage he symbolically moves from the western to the northern phase of his maturation. Manifestly the vision quest takes place on the horizontal plane, the real world formed by the intersection of the North-South and East-West axes. The animals are real animals that exist in the "ordinary" dimensions of space and time. But experience also takes place on another inner axis and dimension, that of meaning. This dimension is cosmically symbolized as the point of inter- section of the two horizontal axes, the center of the mandala, the 57</page><page sequence="10">Inner Eye of Shamanism and Totemism "axis mundi" or break in space that is a point of entry into the empyrean upper sky world and the lower subterranean under- world. This dimension and its worlds is the inner realm in which experience encounters meaning. It is the dimension of mythic time and cosmic space that is the beginning and the end of experience. Initiation for the Beaver comes when he is ready to accept full understanding of the meaning of his vision quest. When he has become an adult, taken on the responsibilities of parenthood, and shown that animals will give themselves to him in order that he may in turn give them to his fellowmen, the Beaver is ready for initiation. It is his progression from North to East and his com- pletion of the first cycle of his life. His initiation is a rebirth or a reentry into the domain of his birth. As he is himself reborn, he is now able to give others life as a hunter, provider, and parent. Initiation comes through the experience of dreaming, and in his dream he sees himself going through his vision quest but in the perspective of knowledge of its cosmic significance. In these dreams he experiences, for the first time, the meaning of what happened to him as a child in terms of a shamanic cosmic structure. He has entered the center of the mandala and seen that the child, who was and is himself, became a god, an animal, a mythical super- natural being. The dreams reveal that his life in the bush was actually an entry into the dimension of mythic time and cosmic space. His communication with animals on this world took him into the internal world in which the myths of creation still exist and the giant animals that are the "boss" of the species are still alive. Spatially the inner dimension of meaning is symbolized by the upper and lower worlds inhabited, respectively, by the giant forms of the game animals and birds, and the other, underworld animals. In anthropological terms, these dreamings constitute his totemic initiation and his entry into a shamanic cosmology. The myths in which giant animals had powers over humans exist not in the distant past, but in the experience of every Beaver Indian. The upper and underworlds to which they were sent by the culture hero, the first man to acquire power, are not geographical places but states of being that may be experienced. Although the childhood experience of living with animals makes a person the recipient of their powers, complete knowledge of its meaning and uses comes only when he has completed a full life cycle; from receiving life from his parents to giving life to his children. Through the dreaming, an inner flight to the center of the childhood experience, the center of the mandala, the point of 58</page><page sequence="11">History of Religions entry into the upper and lower cosmic realms, the initiate learns the taboos of his power and is instructed about the collection of a medicine bundle. These taboos that must be observed by others in his presence and his medicine bundle that hangs above where he sleeps are the external symbols of his internal transformation or initiation. The dreaming flight that is the completion of a child's vision quest and his entry into a system of totemic symbolization is also the prototypical shamanic experience. This is not to say that every Beaver is a shaman, for they distinguish between the initiatory dreaming as an expected encounter with the world of myth, and the shamanic flight of a man who has "died," been initiated not by animals but by a society of shamans in heaven, and returned to earth. BEAVER SHAMANISM There are two levels of power symbolized by two kinds of songs. The vision quest animal power is ma-yine, the gift of an animal to a man. Shamans' songs are ahata-yine, "god songs," the gifts of the creative power itself. To know the powers of animals one must join one's life to theirs, but to know the powers of creation one must die and be re-created. Ma-yine are the songs of animals that stand for their essential qualities in the mythic dimension. Ahata- yine are songs given to men who have died and been re-created through their experience of the power of creation. Men with animal power sleep facing East because they know that to kill an animal is to give it new life and be given life by it; but shamans with ahata-yine sleep facing West because they have died and learned the road to heaven. Men with md-yine dream to bring the shadows of animals from heaven to earth, while shamans dream to guide the shadows of men along the path to heaven. In both cases men dream to the places they have experienced and along the paths they have been initiated into. Just as every animal species and natural property has a "boss" that exists in cosmic space and the mythic time out of time, the human species, too, has its boss which is the androgynous creative force behind all things. The totemism of the Beaver vision quest is a journey into the inner realm of meaning within experience; an encounter with the boss of an animal species. Its logical extension is the shamanic experience; through death and rebirth, an encoun- ter with the boss of the human species, Yagesatz. It is not that their 59</page><page sequence="12">Inner Eye of Shamanism and Totemism creator god is anthropomorphic, but that they see creation totemi- cally as the beginning and end of all human experience. Few people become shamans, and it is a calling that comes upon a man rather than being sought. Although md-yine power is possessed by every normal adult, it is a guarded secret used to defend oneself and friends from enemies and to provide them with food and fortune, and ahata-yine, although known by only a few dreamers, are sung publically for the benefit of all people. Md-yine power may be used both for good and evil depending on the qualities of its possessor. A bad man may use his power selfishly but his misuse of it will always harm himself more than his victim. If a person uses his power to kill another, he sends the victim directly to heaven but takes upon himself all the burdens that weighed down that person's shadow. The selfish use of power is totemically associated with misfortune, while the sharing of power brings the things that men desire. Good human qualities are best symbolized by the conjunction of events that bring men fortune, while bad human qualities symbolize what to us would be inexplicable bad luck. Their totemism seizes upon more than the intellectual symbols available in the world of nature. It also asso- ciates destructive and constructive human states with natural states that destroy and enhance the lives of men. Again, Beaver shamanism is an extension of their system of totemism. While ma-yine is covert and potentially destructive in the hands of bad men, ahata-yine is public and only capable of human benefit. The true shaman who has experienced the road to heaven and brought back the songs of creation can only use his powers to bring men closer to knowledge of themselves and their environment. Ahata-yine are the basis of public ceremonials usually presided over by the shaman. Unlike ma-yine which can only be sung by their recipients in times of personal crisis, the songs brought back by a shaman are public property and are sung and remembered after his death. The Beavers dance to ahata-yine, going clockwise, or as they say, "like the sun" around a fire. The songs and dances symbolize the cycle of creation, transformation and re-creation through which men, animals, and indeed all things pass. Beaver ceremonials are "dancing to heaven." Through the dances and songs, the experience of the shaman is transmitted to his people, and during the ceremonials he often speaks of his dreams and prophesies. Every Beaver Indian has, through his vision quest, entered into the inner dimension of mythical meaning, but only the shaman 60</page><page sequence="13">History of Religions has followed this path to its beginning and end. Ordinary men must know that to take the lives of animals is to give them another form of life (hence their sleeping to the East), but it is the shaman alone who knows, through his own experience, the meaning of human life and death. His sharing of this knowledge is the basis of Beaver ceremonial life, a form of ritual that unites the life cycles of animals with those of men. Thus, the totemic experience that is entered into in the vision quest is completed in the death and return of the shaman. The mythic time and cosmic space that every adult Beaver knows is but the beginning of the road to heaven that has been explored by the shaman in whose footsteps he hopes to follow. Every Beaver has transcended objective reality to grasp, through the symbols of his culture, its subjective meaning, but the shaman has followed this axis mundi, the center of the mandala, to its furthest extreme. Hence his flight is symbolized by the highest-flying bird, the swan, who in flight makes the sign of the cross and who is the only bird capable of flying to heaven and re- turning alive. We shall end this brief discussion of Beaver belief with the identification of shaman with swan, and by pointing out that the swan is the beginning of their mythic symbolization, for the myth of the culture hero that is the prototype of both the vision quest and shamanic flights tells the story of a boy named Swan who becomes the first man to discover the road to heaven. * * * To summarize a paper that has taken much for granted and has led the reader onto a path only poorly understood by the writers is a difficult task. In terms of anthropological theory we have argued that the symbols of totemic thought are also, and more signifi- cantly, those of shamanic cosmology. But in terms of a more general human experience, we have tried to show that the Beaver way of knowledge is simply one culture's symbolization of a dimension of meaning that is open to all men. Although our culture has forgotten its myths and has replaced them with scientific truths that are outside of experience, the enquiry of anthropology into a realm of meaning understood by mythic peoples may help us rediscover an inner reality that has probably never been wholly lost. Just as the Beaver initiation gives symbolic meaning to the naive experiences of childhood, an excursion into their minds may lead us back and forward into the mental states of our individual childhood and cultural old age. 61</page></plain_text>
