This is an excellent and valuable work, which will repay all who read it through. The author's command of the English tongue is not a little remarkable; the knowledge which he brings to his undertaking is wide and full, whilst his loyalty to other workers and his graciousness in controversy are beyond praise. His thesis is not likely to be entirely accepted by all his readers without some hesitation and demur. He attacks, for instance, Darwin's doctrine of sexual selection with much force and reason, especially on the ground that it is absurdly anthropomorphic to attribute to the hen an ~sthetic judgment. She is too low in the animal scale to be able to discriminate between rival shows; and, at any rate, the gesture and song, the colour and form developed in the cock are often ugly and inharmonious. To this an objector might reply, first, that there can be no dispute in matters of taste; it is the hen and not the man that has to be charmed. And then, that Darwin must be taken to have meant, what Darwinians certainly mean, that the hen's choice in these matters is hedonic--as, indeed, is our owu-and that the display of the male bird diffuses through her organism a thrill of pleasure and kindles in particular the erotic emotion which influences her in choosing a mate. The author justly points out (p. 5) that art can no longer be deduced from general philosophical and metaphysical principles, but must be studied by the methods of inductive psychology as a human activity. His endeavour is to prove (p. 302) that the art impulse is an outcome of the tendency of every feeling-state to exteriorise itself, the [ 92 ]</page><page sequence="2">1902.) MAN. [No. 68. effect of such a manifestation being to heighten pleasure and to relieve pain. The artist finds that he can gain such enhancement or relief not merely by giving expression to his feelings, but also by arousing a like feeling in others. Hence comes his desire to transmit his moods to an external audience and to endow his artistic products with permanence. This perpetuation can be explained (p. 303) only by reference to the enhancing and relieving effects which man has experienced as the result of emotional transmission. The author lays much stress on the primordial importance of rhythmi in movement and in music (p. 87) and of those regular recurrences of lines and figures in formative arts that may be called rhythm in material (p. 91); but he derives them all from utilitarian sources (p. 258). As soon as the expression is fixed in rhythmical form, its contagious power is incalculably increased. By its incessant and regular return, rhythm arrests the a3sthetic attention and facilitates the transmission of feeling (pp. 276, 89). Beauty, a combination of grace and harmony, is interpreted as an object of human longing and a source of human enjoyment (p. 5) ; yet utilitarian production can develop grace and form (p. 275). Hence the assumption is not permissible that any work or performance which can be proved to serve a utilitarian purpose must on that accouilt be rejected as a genuine work of ait (p. 7). The dances, the poems, the formative arts of savages have a general usefulness, but they possess unquestionable a3sthetic value also (p. 12). Nevertheless, as regards a dance performance, it is impossible to decide whether its effect on the spectators is the result of the movements themselves, as originating an imitative impuilse, or is caused by the rhythm which regulates them (p. 90). Imitation has a fundamental importance for the development of human culture (p. 74). The wasthetic activities can be understood and explained only by reference to this universal tendency to imitate (p. 75). Play and art have much in common, (p. 29). By considering artistic activity as a kind of play we can account for its attractiveness even whenl no " surplus of vigour " can be shown to exist (p. 27). The aim of play is attained when excessive eniergy is discharged; the function of art, on the contrary, outlasts the act of production, and the play impulse can account for neither beauty nor rhythm. Equally inadequate are the explanations of art as " a self-exhibiting impulse " and as " the instinct to attract by pleasing" (p. 29). Though it may be true that without a public no art would ever have appeared (p. 25), yet the genuine artist does not make it his sole object to please (pp. 24, 25). The simplest forms of art, such as a lyrical dance or a lyrical song, are direct out- bursts of emotional pressure, which if unrelieved would prove dangerous to the system (p. 144). Pleasure nurtures itself by expression, pain is increased as inhibition spreads (p. 41). Art production fulfils with great efficacy a relieving aud cathartic mission (p. 70). The most deep-seated motive of all human activity is to enhance pleasure or to relieve pain, by the expression of over-mastering feeling. It is the fundamental hypothesis of the present work that art is better able than any other kind of mental function to serve and satisfy these requirements (p. 73) ; to give complete and effective relief from emotional pressure (p. 105). On such matters as these the opinion of the artist himself is of little importance (p. 114), for to those who teach or learn an executive art it must unavoidably seem to be chiefly a power and a skill (p. 135). The element of technical perfection is, indeed, the indispensable condition for achieving an embodied feeling (p. 139). The true artist is compelled to seek in esthetic production compensation for the deficiencies of life, and the sense of liberation that follows the attainment of artistic form, relieves his overwhelming and inharmonious excitement (p. 113). The true artist is thle man who has found means to enhance his feelings of pleasure, or to relieve those of pain, and who seeks to arouse kindred feelings in others, in an ever-widening sphere, beyond [ 93</page><page sequence="3">1902.] MAN. [No. 68. the limitations of time and space (pp. 302, 90, 84). Hence he is constrained to seek a response to his emotion from a real, or from a fictitious, public (p. 99). In artistic solitude, as in poetic soliloquy, the ego becomes a substitute for an external audience: the creator exists also as his own spectator (p. 100). Any artistic representation of nature serves the purpose of perpetuating a feeling- state (p. 123). The artist's primary impulse is emotional, and aims at making a particular mood independent of the accidental and individual conditions under which it arose, so as to impress ou spectators this concentrated and isolated view (p. 125). Professor Hirn's chapters on Historical Art, Erotic Art, Art and Magic, are of especial interest. In pictorial as well as in dramatic art the purely commemorative purpose belongs, probably, to the later stages of culture (p. 174). Tribal, like individual mrtemorv, is dependent for its development on favouirable external influences that stimulate the attention (p. 178). Bygone events are preserved in history and art chiefly for their effect in enhancing national pride. Of pride, history has been born. The great monuments are all records of glory. It is this emotional element that makes history an art (p. 181). The aim of religious instruction has been to convey with the utmost distinctness a thought-content; and this has influenced artistic representations of life and nature though when it first began to do so, there are no means of ascertaining (pp. 183, 184). Sexual selection is one cause, but it is not the only cause, of erotic art (p. 242). The strong emotional tension that accompanies pairing demands some methocd of relief by sound or movement; and those manifestations will revive, by association, the pleasur- able feelings with which they have been connected (p. 243). All forms of art have their unity in the essential unity of all feeling (p. 139). The chief non-Desthetic factors that have favoured the development of art are the utilitarian motives to give information; to propitiate (that is, to flatter the senses by a display of beauty) ; to stimulate (that is, to heighten vital energy); and to work magic (p. 301 ). Such, then, in brief, and mainly in Professor Hirn's own words, are his persuasive doctrines of the origins of art. In considering the value of an explanation it is useful to compare it with an alternative. The human organism, reacting upon its environment by movements of approach towards the beneficial or of aggression against the injurious, finds that the advantage gained, increased good or lessened evil, is associated with action, and a pleasurable sense of power is originated. The love of power thus becomes a fundamental impulse; not strengtb nor skill, but their exercise ; power over one's limbs and organs; over one's words and modes of speech; over the elements of music and the synmbols of thought; over material, the pliant osier, the plastic clay, the rigid stone, the luminous pigment ; and over other living creatures, in strife, in games, in intellect, in art. The child who plays in solitude is a despot to her dolls, is a martinet to his tin soldiers " make believe " is always imperious. An artist is one who has by natuire, or who seeks to acquire by practice, a special power over his limbs or organs, and over material, and this power he cultivates tllat he may be able to influence other men, to excite in them the same emotion that moves himself. His autotely is ever merging into socialism. His art impulse is the love of power to reproduce his own feelings in others, but a part of his anticipated reward is an enchancement of his own emotion and not a catharsis. It is the inventor, whether in art, physics, or mathematics, who after prolonged gestation and the final pangs of birth, experiences a cathartic joy when his conception, in a concrete form, is at last born into the world. But this is an intellectual rather than an emotional relief, it is the thought-strain that suddenly comes to an end. lf there are men, whether potters, painters, or poets, who make things without a love of dominion, first over material, and then over the human heart, they are workmen and not artists.

If there are men who, like misers, fill their studio with hidden manuscripts and sculpture, then it is sweet to them to hold these means of influence in secret possession. The musician whose audience is inattentive to him loses all interest in his own performance. But he is roused to an ecstasy of delight when his hearers are entranced, when his baton not only sways the orchestra but rules the assembly. The common aim of him and them is to redouble and not to discharge emotion; to fill the cup of their longing. And if, as a result, their attention is diverted from painful thoughts or feelings, certainly that is " a relief," but the word is ambiguous, and in this case has a non-cathartic meaning. Mr. Stout shows* that the pleasures of sense, after satiety has passed away, give rise to a craving for renewed stimulation. If these pleasures are interrupted before satiety is reached, a tension is experienced, " an unsatisfied conation." Is Professor Hirn's cathartic effect, after all, the same thing as Mr. Stout's attainment of satiety ? HY. COLLEY MARCH.</page></plain_text>
