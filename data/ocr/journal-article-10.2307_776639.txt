<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Late Braque at the Phillips and Some Comments on the Braque Centennial The past year, 1982, was the one-hundredth anniversary of the birth of Georges Braque (1882-1963), one of history's finest paint- ers. The Braque celebrations, like the man himself, have been relatively modest. Nonetheless, there have been three illu- minating exhibits to mark the occasion. In June, the Centre Georges Pompidou mounted two simultaneous exhibits: one, Braque, oeuvres des Georges Braque, with detailed catalogue by Nadine Pouillon and Isabelle Monod-Fontaine, provided an overview through works from French pub- lic collections; the other, Georges Braque, les Papiers Colles, was created jointly by the Musee National d'Art Moderne and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. This, under the respective curatorship of Monod-Fontaine and E.A. Carmean, Jr., explored the artist's creation of collage, which introduced the final Synthetic Cubist phase of his collaboration with Picasso between 1912 and 1914. Finally, Robert Cafritz of The Phillips Collection has composed the beautiful and much needed Georges Braque: The Late Paintings, which includes works from the Paris retro- spective as well as works from the Phillips' own and numerous other public and private collections from around the world. Braque received about every honor his country could bestow, including the only one-man exhibition ever given to a living artist by the Louvre. Despite his achieve- ments, persistently confused critical per- spectives have clouded his place in the history of modern art, particularly in the United States. This, as John Russell has pointed out, is in large measure owing to The Museum of Modern Art's stake in the reputations of Braque's colleagues, Matisse and Picasso. 1 Braque was introduced to the newly named Fauve movement in the fall of 1905. He spent the following summer in Antwerp as a novitiate "wild beast," and that au- tumn, at Derain's suggestion, he made his first trip to L'Estaque, already immortal- ized by Cezanne. In early June of 1907, he saw the exhibit of Cezanne's watercolors at Bernheim Jeune in Paris. With these in mind, he went south with Emile-Othon Friesz to La Ciotat, where he painted his last Fauve pictures. In October 1907, he saw something new in the late works of Cezanne in the great posthumous retrospective at the Salon d'Automne: reductive color and rectilinear structure. Guillaume Apollinaire noted that Braque left Paris shortly after the opening of the salon for the South of France.2 He returned to L'Estaque, where he painted a series of landscapes in homage to the Aix master.3 He de-emphasized color, empha- sized construction, and took the first steps along an unwavering path that resulted in his exhibition of the first Cubist paintings in the Independents in May 1908.4 MR. Fig. 1 Georges Braque standing before The Billiard Table. The confusion about Braque's achieve- ments begins here. He was the last and most youthful adherent to, and the first defector from, Fauvism. Thus, his artistic beginnings were in the shadow of Matisse and company. Then came Picasso. Braque and Picasso met in December of 1907. According to tradition, Braque ini- tially had misgivings about Picasso's work but overcame them and, under the influence of the Demoiselles d'Avignon, made an about-face in his own work and became the Spaniard's disciple. William Rubin has done much to correct this erroneous per- ception,5 but more needs to be done. Suf- fice it to say, however, that Braque never in his life made a dramatic shift in his style. His development was one of contin- uous growth punctuated by periodic inno- vations inspired by his own poetic vision. Further, he was never a follower of Picas- so's. If anything, at least between 1908 and 1914, the reverse is true. Rubin has correctly shown that Picasso, not Braque, altered course in 1908, shifting from his striated, Africanesque works of the winter of 1907-08 to a more geometric, Cezann- esque mode of representation by the fol- lowing autumn. Such a switch in direction is inconceivable without Braque's example. Braque, through his absorption and devel- opment of Cezanne, was certainly the in- novator in early Cubism, and he maintained the role of innovator throughout his part- nership with Picasso. In the summer of 1908 at L'Estaque, Braque created those houses and musical instruments that, when exhibited at Kahn- weiler's in the autumn, led Vauxcelles to use the word "cube" in association with modern painting for the first time.6 Charles Morice, in Mercure de France, acknowl- edged Braque as the "leader of the auda- cious" and used the word "cubism," con- firming the currency of the term and the effect of Braque's new style.7 That sum- mer, Picasso, in Horta del Ebro, moved into line with the style Braque had devel- oped twelve months earlier. Braque con- tinued to integrate form and space through interpenetrating facet planes in his quest for what he called "tactile" space. The hatch-mark structural passages of his 1908 works evolved into those divisionist marks that became fundamental to the Analytic Cubist vocabulary. In the autumn of 1909, the acquaintance between Braque and Picasso matured. They became, as Braque said, "roped together like mountain climbers," but in terms of Cubism's major innovations, Braque con- tinued to hammer in most of the pitons. In the winter of 1909-10, it was he who intro- duced trompe l'oeil images of nails and fragments of words into their ever more abstract and disjunctive compositions.8 In early 1910, he introduced the oval-shaped canvas to the repertoire of Cubist formal devices. These innovations supplied the grammar for the High Analytic vocabulary of Braque's and Picasso's Cubism during 1911. During the late summer of 1912, once again Braque supplied the point of departure for the final phase of the collabo- ration. With his discoveries of the artistic potential of faux bois and faux marbre house-painting techniques and normally extraneous materials such as sand, grit, and finally imitation wood-grain paper, he created the means by which Synthetic Cubism could be realized.9 Although Braque guided the course of Cubism, the eclectic and inventive Picasso was quick to seize and embellish each of his friend's inventions, frequently achiev- ing the partnership's most magnificent creations. That Braque's role in the associ- ation has so long been undervalued is as much owing to the differences in their per- sonalities as to their respective public visi- bility. Theirs was an attraction of opposites in which each gained from the other. From Braque, Picasso got stability and direction Spring 1983 83</page><page sequence="2">at a time when he was uncertain of his course. From Picasso, Braque received the inspiration and competition of a natural talent with a breadth of creativity that ex- ceeded his own. This chemistry created a revolution. Picasso once compared Braque to Wilbur Wright. In terms of that analogy, it must be said that Braque was the inventor of the Cubist airplane, even though Picasso was occasionally its more brilliant pilot. Their collaboration ended with the be- ginning of World War I. Braque was com- missioned and sent to the front, received a serious head wound in 1915, and did not resume painting until 1917. He never did completely regain the physical strength for which he was renowned as a young man. The tools forged during the Cubist years, however, gave Braque the means by which his art would continuously evolve. He began to exhibit again in 1919. Those works, painted during the previous two years, are characterized by layered planes and the reintroduction of one of Braque's strongest native gifts: that of a colorist. They may be considered the last of his Synthetic Cubist works. The 1920s and 1930s brought success. Braque's art became more expansive and sumptuous, if less dramatically innovative than it had been before the war. At the same time, following the lead of his spiri- tual ancestor, Cezanne, Braque became more solitary. After 1929 he spent an in- creasing amount of time in the country house he had built at Varengeville in Nor- mandy, near where he had grown up. By the end of the 1930s-with the excep- tion of a relatively small number of figure compositions such as the Canephorae, his illustrations for Hesiod's Theogenie, and his Artist and Model Series-Braque began to fix his attention on those subjects that had always most motivated him: landscape and still life. During his last two and one-half decades, the period that The Phillips' exhi- bition examines in Georges Braque: The Late Paintings, these subjects preoccupy him. This magnificent exhibition is the first in America to examine the paintings of these years exclusively.'0 Beautifully se- lected, it shows Braque to have been the consummate painter's painter. In the catalogue, Herschel Chipp correct- ly relates Braque to the great French tradi- tion of intensely intimate still-life painting, comparing him aptly with both Chardin and Cezanne. 11 Chipp also rightly observes that the reawakened interest in landscape in Braque's last years reveals stylistic con- cerns somewhat different from the post- Cubist still lifes and interiors.12 In his last twenty-three years, Braque reexamined his two earliest inspirations: the expressive touch and glowing color of his Fauve months and the structure and narrative of the Cubist years. In so doing, as this exhibit reveals, he created paintings that John Rus- sell has called "some of the most beautiful .. ... fi r, e ol,-- :.Mu p.

These fifty master- pieces, the culmination of a lifetime's de- liberation, are a transition from acute ob- servation to mystical metamorphosis, pro- ducing personal poetry through manipula- tion of form and substance. Sadly, as in his early years, Braque's late achievements, at least in America, were obscured by contemporaneous events. His only major exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art took place in 1949, about the same time Pollock produced his first drip paintings. In the exuberant years fol- lowing World War II, American criticism became almost chauvinistic in extolling the primacy of American abstract art. Com- pared with the successive waves of Abstract Expressionism, Post-Painterly Abstraction, Color Field, Pop Art, and Minimalism, 84 Art Journal</page><page sequence="3">Braque's intimate subjects, complex poet- ics, and masterful techniques seemed to the powers-that-be rather passe. Moreover, as anyone at The Museum of Modem Art would have told you, the death of Matisse left only one great European master: Picas- so, of course. The Phillips' exhibit, however, demon- strates what Braque's admirers have long known: that he is the equal of anyone on two counts-the eloquent amalgamation of design and subject and the subtle orches- tration of color. On a third, the sheer mas- tery of the materials and means of painting, he stands alone. In his last two and one-half decades, Braque became more and more concerned with his own mortality. Between 1937 and 1943, drawing once again on the example of Cezanne, he painted a series of still lifes containing images of human skulls and crucifixes, thereby establishing the vanitas theme that underlay the rest of his oeuvre. Most of his late paintings are in series and explore three types of subject matter: interiors, landscapes, and symbolic images of birds. Often these subjects are combined in the same work. All reflect objects, places, and concerns of great significance to the artist. The still lifes are transforma- tions of intimate household items from the homes in Paris and Varengeville occupied by himself and his wife, Marcelle. The monumental Studios, anticipated in the Artist and Model paintings, employ the iconography of the workplace, using im- ages not only of objects but also of ideas. The Billiard Tables represent recreation, and, specifically, a game that involves time, space, geometry, and movement and is a paradigm for Cubist aesthetics. At the same time, it is a game that has infinite variations but that, like life itself, must end. The Birds are spiritual symbols that also represent movement in time and space and must, too, represent the transience of life. Braque's synthesis of experience and emotion, the way he imbued ordinary ob- jects and places with monumental dignity, and his overlapping of themes both finite and eternal through creative metamorphosis provide the most moving aspects of his art. Three works from the Phillips exhibit, The Small Billiard Table of 1945, Studio VI of 1950-51, and The Weeding Machine, 1960-63, will serve to reveal the interaction of theme and subject, the complexity and the beauty of Braque's creativity during his late years. The Small Billiard Table (Fig. 2) was done the year after the occu- pation ended, a year in which Braque's health failed badly enough to keep him from working for several months. It is one of the smallest of the Billiard Table series developed between 1944 and 1949, but is one of the most illuminating. It is a more complex development from a similar com- position of the previous year (also in The Late Paintings, P1. 13).

Georges Braque. foreground and background with continu- ations and intersections of the outlines of objects and architecture creating a rectilin- ear compositional grid. He annihilates tra- ditional perspective, creating a shifting view that rotates around the "T" junction of the hanging light fixture. The crossbar of this fixture indicates two of the paint- ing's most provocative iconographic ele- ments. At the upper left, it points to an anthropomorphic configuration composed of human garments and a playful reference to human frailty. Throughout his life, Braque's subjects were drawn from things or places with which he was familiar, yet, as Chipp points out, there was never a billiard table in Braque's home. The gar- ments-a coat hung over a chair, a hat, and a checkered scarf hung from the wall -create a metaphoric metamorphosis of a human figure, metaphor being a device Braque had often used before.'1 The letters compose the word "Ivresse" (drunken- ness), and judging from the style of their printing, they undoubtedly derive from those notices on the walls of French cafes citing the laws concerning "L'Ivresse Publique." This locates one source of Braque's series: the billiard area so often seen in French bars and cafes, so profound- ly expressed in Van Gogh's Night Cafr. Just such public places had inspired many of Braque's own and other's Cubist images before World War I. He may also be mak- ing an amusing comment on the somewhat inebriated character of the composition. The other end of the light fixture both indicates and obscures another illusive creation. The curving lines arching up from the bottom of the canvas to both right and left serve two functions. Formally, they give visual access to both halves of the picture, providing lyrical movement to counteract the static geometry of the com- position. Simultaneously, they create the transparent image of a plume-tailed, pi- geon-headed bird, whose body and feet are cut off by the lower edge of the canvas. The location of the head, beak, and eye is determined by the lower end of the lamp. This avian apparition plays an important role in Braque's work. The fact that this image, which first appeared in his Hesiod illustrations of 1929, recurs here as World War II ended is probably inspired by the bird's tradition as a symbol of peace. The bird also served Braque as a less macabre memento mori than the skulls he used pre- viously. White-outlined birds are in the background of his Large Billiard Table, 1949 (see Fig. 1), and he used a single bird to illustrate Rene Char's Le Soleil des Eaux in 1949. The bird is an enigmatic inhabitant of his eight monumental Studios of 1949- 55 and becomes the central figure in his Bird and Nest and Birds in Flight paintings of the 1950s, including his ceiling painting for the Louvre's Salle Henri II done in 1952-53. There are also birds in the skies of many of his late landscapes and marines. Whereas the Billiard Tables represent places and activities of recreation, the Stu- dios represent work and, for Braque, life itself. In the Studio paintings he also uses subject matter that had long served him well. Studio VI (Fig. 3) includes a bird, a fish, an archaistic sculpted head, and the word "cahier," referring both to Braque's intimate notebooks and to Christian Zervos' journal, Cahiers d'Art, which had often published material on Braque. The painting is a compendium of Braque's collected and utilized objects: jars, jugs, lamps, palettes, paints, and brushes. It is an alle- gorical self-portrait, and, significantly, in the hourglass just above the word "cahier," the sands are running. The late landscapes parallel the other series in thematic concerns but differ in style. All done during his ever-longer stays Spring 1983 85</page><page sequence="4">at Varengeville, these works represent an old man's reconsiderations of his youthful work. They reflect a life-long contempla- tion and fascination with nature that in- spired both his Fauve and early Cubist paintings and now represent life gone full cycle. These stormy images of the Norman coast and countryside, the scenes of his boyhood, are profoundly direct responses to the rural world. The Weeding Machine (Fig. 4) of 1960-63 is painted in an ex- pressive manner that recalls Braque's Fauve work. One of his last paintings, it is remi- niscent of another famous late picture, Van Gogh's Crows over the Wheatfields, upon which Vincent was working when he killed himself. The Phillips Collection has provided a painting lesson for anyone interested in seeing how fine fine art can be. As a color- ist, Braque is shown in full round. No artist, with the possible exceptions of Goya and Rembrandt, has been better in using the palette's darker ranges. Black domi- nates the late paintings and is used not only to establish a contemplative mode of me- mento mori but also to set the tonal key of Braque's orchestrations. Dark greens, mauves, and earthy reds create the melody, with occasional flourishes and crescendos of vivid pinks, yellows, and oranges used as counterpoint. This musical analogy is particularly apt in speaking of Braque, himself a musician, who loved Bach and Mozart and often used musical terms as part of his compositions. Braque's color is the complement to that of Matisse's. In Matisse, we "see" the jazzy sounds of reeds and brasses; in Braque, the color is that of the woodwinds, low horns, and strings, with intermittent clashes of the timpani and cymbals. Braque had few peers as a colorist; as a craftsman, he had none. He repeatedly made the impossible look easy, breaking every accepted rule for the handling of a painted surface with results that seem as natural as breathing. Starting literally from the ground up, he prepared his support with a stiffly brushed viscous gesso applied with the care of a pastry chef icing a cake. While the gesso was still wet, Braque would mask areas of the ground and, pos- sibly with the aid of a tea strainer, sprinkle thin films of sand over the exposed areas, thus differentiating his composition not only by shape but also by surface. The texture of the paint itself is also richly variegated. Often switching from transpar- ent glazes to crusty impastos at a stroke, Braque controlled these surprising leaps through subtle transitions of hue and tone. He often used what could be called "anti- drawing," vigorously painting the broad shapes of his design and leaving thin webs of bare white ground to serve as outline. In an age of graffiti and pasted plate-shard figuration, Braque's lyrical masterpieces should be required viewing for every seri- ous art student. Although Braque made drawings, prints, and sculpture, he was never the equal of either Matisse or Picasso in all these medi- ums nor of a number of specialists in each. As a painter, however, he ranks with the best of history. Picasso is supposed to have said, "I am the greatest artist of the twenti- eth century but Braque is the greatest paint- er." The statement may be apocryphal, but if Picasso didn't say it, he should have.
