By C. E. M. JOAD. IT is not easy to define free will; it is probably impossible to define it satisfactorily. Nor do I think that it is possible to assert its existence with any confidence: at any rate it is not my intention to do so in this paper, for, although I feel a strong pre- possession in favour of the belief that I do in fact possess it, it does not seem to me that there is any satisfactory logical proof either that I do or that I do not; or, more correctly, since the existence of free will can be both asserted and denied with every appearance of logical finality, the prudent course seems to be neither to assert nor to deny. What can be done, however, is to indicate certain conditions which must clearly be satisfied in order that free will may be possible, and this is the object of the present paper. With regard to some of these conditions most people would, I imagine, agree that their absence precludes the possibility of free will; with regard to others it is not, I think, generally recognized, especially by supporters of so-called Vitalist theories, to what extent the various forms in which these theories are commonly formulated do in fact exclude the conditions which I hold to be necessary. I propose, therefore, to devote the bulk of this paper to a consideration of these forms of Vitalism, and to indicate the respects in which they seem to me to fail to provide for the possibility of free will, while believing that they most certainly do provide for it. In the first place, however, I must briefly glance at the so-called Materialist theories against which Vitalism is most appropriately to be regarded as a reaction, since the failure 0</page><page sequence="2">122 C. E. M. JOAD. of these theories to provide for the freedom of the human spirit, was the main cause of the reaction. I. The materialistic theories prevalent at the close of the last century had a scientific backing in physics, biology, astronomly and geology. Their cumulative effect was to belittle the import- ance of life in general and of human life in particular. Just as Copernicus abolished the primacy of man's planet within the Universe, so Darwin abolished man's primacy within his planet. The world, as the followers of Darwin and Lamarck defined it, was something fundamentally hostile, or at least indifferent to the life that had manifested itself by a mere accident within it. Life appeared to them as an alien passenger travelling across a fundamentally hostile environment, which would one day-when, for instance, the heat of the sun had sufficiently diminished -finish its pointless journey with as little noise and significance as had attended its beginning. The greater the advances made in scientific knowledge, the more relatively unimportant did the status of life appear. Astronomy indefinitely extended space, geology time, and in the vast immensities of astronomic space and geologic time life appeared as a tiny glow, which, in the absence of any directive or controlling purpose whose business might be conceived to be to keep it alight, would, at no very distant date, flicker out. For the rest, the Universe functioned mechanically like the works of a gigantic clock. Somebody or something at some time unknown had wound the clock up and set it going; hence- forward it worked and would continue to work automatically through the mere interaction of its parts. Life, presumably, was one of these parts, and was therefore determined by the others. At any rate, any modifications in so-called vital organisms were either purely chance affairs or were the result of previous modifi-</page><page sequence="3">THE PROBLEM OF FREE WILL. 123 cations in their material surroundings to which the vital organisms either automatically adapted themselves or perished. Causa- tion, that is to say, proceeded always from the material to the vital. The materialist biology had its counterpart in the Parallelist psychology. Material changes in the body were supposed to be accompanied inevitably by corresponding changes in the brain, or-since from this point of view we may use the two terms interchangeably-in the mind. There is, in fact, complete parallelism between mind and body, so that, even if we do not assume an actual causal relationship, it is nevertheless true that all psychological phenomena are, as it were, the reflections of physiological modifications whose occurrence alone renders them possible. This at least is what the theory asserts in its milder forms. Bolder thinkers, however, did not hesitate to deny the existence of mind as a unique entity altogether regarding it merely as a rarefied form of bodily tissue. Mind is then either the sum of the neural correlates which constitute the brain, or a highly attenuated material substance surrounding the brain like the halo round the head of a saint. In either event its only function is to register cerebral occurrences, which are themselves dependent on physiological changes, which are in their turn dependent on changes in external material phenomena. Thus in every sphere the material determines and conditions the mental; the law of cause and effect operates universally and operates from the material to the mental. With increased knowledge of biology and physiology it would become possible to account for and to predict every mental occurrence, however remote, however complicated, and we arrive at a point of view such as that of Tyndall, for whom science would ultimately be able to describe and predict all events both mental and material as forming part of " the purely natural and inevitable march of evolution from the atoms of the primaeval nebula to the pro- ceedings of the British Association for the advancement of science." o 2</page><page sequence="4">124 C. E. M. JOAD. It is almost superfluous to point out that such a conception of the Universe and of the position of life within it provides no place for free will. Mind for it is in no sense creative; psychology is not distinct from physiology; ethics is a pious illogicality. How can mind be free when it is merely the register of the body ? How can the body be free when it is at the mercy of external material forces ? In order that the will may function inde- pendently it is necessary that ethics should be a possibility; in order that ethics may be a possibility it is necessary that we should be able to choose this and to reject that. Ethics is a structure based on the twin pillars of praise and blame: but there is no point in blaming a man for what he cannot help. I conclude, therefore, that when the Vitalists charged scientific materialism with the imprisonment of the human spirit within the chains of circumstance, their charge was a valid one. It remains to be seen to what extent their own theories in the forms in which they are normally expressed can be vindicated from the same charge. II. The reaction against materialism is itself largely scientific in origin. It arises, on its scientific side, from a feeling of dis- satisfaction with the exceedingly vague thing that a modern materialism must be. Matter is no longer the simple entity that it was for Tyndall and Huxley. It has become just as mysterious as mind, and it is much less familiar. There is no longer a clear, definite, tangible, homogeneous something upon which the common sense of the materialist can base his irrefragable convictions. For matter we have to substitute something like the changing relationships between unreal point-events which are in relative motion, and the tendency to explain phenomena in terms of causation by spirit rather than by matter is a nattural expression of one's preference for working with the simple rather than with the complex.</page><page sequence="5">THE PROBLEM OF FREE WILL. 125 However that may be, the tendency to regard phenomena both mental and material as the expression, objectification, representation, call it what you will, of some all-pervasive Force or Spirit now rivals in popularity the old materialistic hypothesis of some thirty years ago. At first sight such a re-orientation of attitude would seem to be all in favour of the freedom of the will. If a creative spirit perpetually functioning is the cause of the Universe being what it is and becoming what it becomes, it is only natural to regard the free human will as its most obvious expression. But further examination reveals difficulties, and it is these which we must now examine. All the leading Vitalist systems possess, in addition to their hostility to mechanism, one common feature: they postulate one thing and one thing only in the Universe as real, and from this thing derive by various methods the complicated manifold of mind, body and apparently inorganic matter which we know by means of the senses. For Bergson this reality is a continuous flow or change. It is a pure becoming without marks or features of any kind, the distinctions and individuations we discern in it being due to the discriminating, selecting and cutting-up operations of our in- tellects. To this ceaseless flux we ourselves belong and, by the faculty of Intuition, we can at times realize the pulse of duration wnithin us, and our participation in the stream of life. It would not be correct to say that our consciousnesses are expressions of the elan vital; they are the elan vital; and since this is envisaged as a free and creative impulsion, we too are free and creative making our own lives as we live them. Beyond the elan vital there is nothing. For Schopenhauer reality is a non-logical principle called the Will. The Will is conceived as a sort of effort, a wanting or striving of any and every kind. The Will manifests itself in various representations; one of these representations is human</page><page sequence="6">126 C. E. M. JOAD. consciousness, another is the collection of apparently inorganic objects which we call matter. The relationship between the Will and its representations is the same as that between Kant's noumiienon and phenomena. The representations of the Will are temporary and inessential and are ultimately re-absorbed in it. A somewhat similar system has recently been propounded by M. Geley of the International Metapsychical Institute, Paris. M. Geley's interests are chiefly biological, and his object the discomfiture of the mechanists. M. Geley seeks for a directive, controlling, vital principle as the driving force behind evolution which he declares to be incapable of explanation on mechanist lines, and ultimately finds it in Schopenhauer's Will, to which he gives the somewhat forbidding title of " a dynamo-psychism." Representations of the dynamo-psychism in individuals are temporary and are re-absorbed into the psychism at death; they are absorbed, however, in such a way that each vital monad which constitutes an individual self retains the characteristics acquired by it during a conscious life time, and carries these with it into its next temporary representation as an individual. M. Geley locates the essential seat of the dynamo-psychism in the individual in the unconscious. All these systems make much of their vindication of the free- dom of the individual will; and as, in this respect, they are roughly identical, it will be convenient in what follows to treat them together. In the first place attention should be drawn to the considerable looseness of expression which Vitalist writers adopt when they refer to the relationship between their vital principle and the individual self. The nature of this relationship is of great importance, yet it is very variously described. Sometimes the individual self is an expression of the vital principle, sometimes it is a representation of it, sometimes a modification, sometimes an objectification; when language of this type is used, a difference</page><page sequence="7">THE PROBLEM OF FREE WILL. 127 in point of reality between the principle and its individualiza- tions is clearly implied. Sometimes, however, the self is, as it is for Bergson, literally a part of the all-pervasive principle, equally real with it and falsely conceived as distinct from it. The various types of relationship suggested can, I think, be reduced to two, which it will be convenient to consider separately. (1) The individual may be considered to be not distinct from the vital principle, but identical with it; or (2) he may be considered to be a specialized portion of it, temporarily cut off from the main body, so to speak, but ultimately re-absorbed into it. Both of these relationships are, to my mind, untenable, and both of them preclude the possibility of free will. (1) Schopenhauer considers that the whole Will is present in each of its representations. It is omnipresent and all-per- vasive. Not only is it wholly present in each one of us, but it is wholly affirmed in each act of ours. For this reason Schopen- hauer's view that the use of the Will against itself by the ascetic who seeks to cut off the Will to Live at its source, really con- stitutes a victory over the Will, is inconsistent with his premises, since, so long as one individual remains who is subservient to the Will to Live and pursues the ordinary sensual life, the whole Will is completely expressed in each of his desires and mani- fested in each of his acts. But, if this is the case, it is clear that conflict between desires is impossible. If the whole Will is present in any one of our desires, it clearly cannot be present in any other until the first one has waned or passed away. There is thus no competition between desires; there is only a succession of desires. Further, if it is the whole of Reality that animates each act and desire of ours, it is clearly impossible that our desires and actions should be other than they are: in fact they are not ours at all, but only representations of an all-pervasive reality.</page><page sequence="8">128 C. E. M. JOAD. But if there is no conflict between desires, but merely succes- sion of desires, it is clear that any exhortation to the effect that we should suppress one desire in the interests of another, or of what is rational, is beside the point. (Schopenhauer apparently overlooks this when he tells us that we ought to turn the WVill in its fourth representation against the Will to Live which is the second representation of the Will). Suppression of desire is not on this view an act of the individual's will, i.e., of an entity which is other than desire; it is simply the supersession of one desire or manifestation of the Will by another; while, if our desires are not ours but are simply representations of the omni- present Will, it is absurd to blame us for having them or to expect us to control them. There is indeed no means by which we could control or oppose them except by means of some further nmanifestation of the Will; yet even if we suppose that Reality could control or act against itself, how can a perfectly homo- geneous unity act in contrary ways at the same moment? Plato showed, I think conclusively, that it cannot, in his proof, that the soul is not an undifferentiated unity but possesses three parts. I conclude, therefore, that even if we could admit the possibility of a relationship of this type, it rules out free will. It appears in fact to be open to precisely the same form of objection as the conception of free will favoured by orthodox theologians. If the Universe is the creation of an omnipotent, omniscient and benevolent Deity, every act of every one of His creatures proceeds ultimately from Him. He cannot then be absolved from the responsibility for any human action, His responsibility, and consequently human irresponsibility, being clearly implied by any or all of the follow- ing considerations:- (a) If He is the sole creative force in the Universe all life derives from Him. His, therefore, is the motive power which is manifested in every act of every living creature, if only because</page><page sequence="9">THE PROBLEM OF FREE WILL. 129 there is no other source from which this motive power can be derived. (b) Even if we were to admit the possibility that pain and evil, error and inconsistency are due to human sinfulness and imperfection and not to divine onmipotence, we are compelled to inquire for the origin of human sinfulness and imperfection. Now, if there is literally only one thing in the Universe, the seeds of these qualities must clearly have been implanted by that one thing. But if the seeds of potential sinfulness in the initial amoeba came from God, and if the chain of evolutionary causation between the amoeba and man be assumed to be complete, it is clear that He cannot escape the responsibility for the Ilford murder. (c) If God is really omniscient there can be nothing which He does not know; therefore He knows the future. His know- ledge cannot err: therefore the future must occur exactly as His knowledge pictures it: therefore the future is determined: therefore the apparent freedom of our will to determine it, within limits as we please, is an illusion. (2) Most Vitalists would, however, disavow the notion that the whole of the vital principle with which they identify reality is affirmed in each individual act. They prefer to speak of the individual as an expression of the vital principle, in some way divorced, though only temporarily, from the main stream. Or the individual is a specialized aspect or individualization of the main stream: or he is described as a spiritual " monad," of such a kind that the collection of such monads in itself constitutes the whole of spiritual reality, that is to say the whole of reality. The circumstance that the relationship so envisaged is one which has never been clearly thought out, renders its formulation in precise terms impracticable. A careful examination of the ideas which writers of this type wish us to entertain will,</page><page sequence="10">130 C. E. M. JOAD. however, serve to illustrate not only the varying conceptions which they have in mind, but the difficulties that attend them. It is clear in the first place that the spiritual or vital monad, which is the individual self, must be either separate from the main stream or not separate from it. (a) If it is not separate from it, it is part of it. Whatever occurs in the individual self occurs therefore in the main stream; motions of the self are determined by the main stream and its activities are imposed by it. The self is in fact like a bubble in a river: the bubble has no life of its own apart from the river, and cannot be supposed to generate any activity in or from itself. Free will, therefore, in the sense of an individual will which can be other than and possibly opposed to that of the vital principle which constitutes the whole of Reality, does not exist. This position is in fact only a confused statement of that already considered in (1) above. (b) If it is separate from it, we must suppose that something has intervened to separate it. It may be objected here that I am using a crude spatialized metaphor which is inapplicable to the operations of a spiritual Force. My answer is that we are compelled to think of the matter in this way, since we can think of it in no other. We cannot help thinking of the Force as a material something, although we know that it is nothing of the sort, and we cannot avoid using spatial, and therefore obviously misleading, metaphors to describe it. Let us waive, however, for the present the notion of an interrupting or intervening some- thing, and consider first another metaphor under which the relationship between reality and individual expressions of it is described. The real is said to divide itself up and to objectify itself in a number of individual monads. This is the language used by Schopenhauer and also by M. Geley. Now it may be admitted that if the relationship here suggested were</page><page sequence="11">THE PROBLEM OF FREE WILL. 131 tenable, free will in the individual might be preserved. But is it tenable ? The representations or objectifications in which the real manifests itself are either equally real with it or less real than it. If they are equally real with it, they must be of the same nature as it. In what sense then are they described as ephemeral, inessential and temporary? And what of the body and brain which both M. Geley and Schopenhauer regard as less real than that monad of the Will or of the dynamo-psychism, which is objectified in the individual ? In what sense are these, which also presumably spring from the vital principle, at once equally real with it and at the same time less real, in the sense of being less important, than the mind or unconscious, or than that faculty whatever it may be, with which we are to identify the direct expression of the vital principle ? If on the other hand we are to regard either (i) the mind or the unconscious, or (ii) the body and brain, as in some sense less real than the vital principle of which they are regarded as tem- porary representations, we are confronted with a difficulty equally great. We are in fact asked to conceive of the vital principle which is reality objectifying itself in something which is less real than itself, although, since it constitutes the whole of reality, nothing less real than itself can ex hypothesi exist. The individual, it must be remembered, is partial, finite and temporary, and, on this assumption, in some sense less real than the principle which animates him. Yet we may well ask, how it is possible that the real and eternal should be able not only to enter into connexion with but to be the inmost cause of the being of that which is unreal and temporary. Or, to put the question as briefly as possible, we may ask how reality can ever become less real than itself. (c) There remains to be considered in this connexion the view to which we referred above that the individual self is</page><page sequence="12">132 C. E. M. JOAD. constituted by some interruption of the vital force or principle. The vital force, that is to say, is now thought of not as distri- buting itself through different channels as the result of some principle of dispersal contained within itself, but as being dispersed unwillingliy through the intervention of some external agency, which opposes the main stream and diverts it into different channels. This conception again might provide a loophole for free will, if the conception were tenable. But a moment's reflection shows that it is not. B3ergson holds that matter is the result of an intervention or interruption of this kind. The creative impulse of endless duration which is the elan vital does not proceed without inter- ruption. At a certain point the flow is interrupted and, like the recoil of a spring, turns back upon itself. This reverse movement is matter. Everything is still ceaseless change and flow, but matter is a flow in the direction opposite to that of the vital surge itself. The conception is illustrated by the simile of the jet of a fountain which is life and the drops which fall back which are matter, and of the ascending rocket and the stick which falls to the ground. But there can be no interruption without there being some- thing to interrupt. What then is this something ? It cannot be the flow itself, because this could only interrupt itself in virtue of some stoppage within itself, and such a stoppage would be the interruption which it seeks to explain; nor can it be matter, since matter proceeds from the interruption and is not there- fore the interruption which causes matter. We are driven then to suppose that the real must contain the seeds of difference within itself; that instead of being pure, featureless, becoming it is ab initio qualified and articulated. A precisely similar difficulty attends the view that the self is constituted by a portion of the vital principle localized and individualized as the result of an</page><page sequence="13">THE PROBLEM OF FREE WILL. 133 intervention or interruption of the vital principle. But, if this difficulty is a valid one, we must give up the notion that reality is a homogeneous unity; we must in fact abandon the view that there is only one thing in the Universe. (3) This indeed is the conclusion which is borne in upon us from whatever angle we approach the subject. Not only can we not explain the free will of individuals, if we assume that the vital principle is both the One and the All, but we cannot account for the fact of there being individuals whose free will has to be explained. Take, for instance, the account of the emergence of the Self given by M. Geley, whose view here follows very closely upon that of Schopenhauer. According to this view the Self is formed by the grouping together on principles of affinity of a number of monads, which are individual portions of the dynamo- psychism, into a temporary unit. As soon as such a group is formed, one of the monads apparently assumes a directive or controlling position, and it is. this central monad which con- stitutes the real controlling Self. But either the vital principle is a homogeneous unity or it is not. If it is, you cannot derive from it the principle of difference which the conception of groups of individual monads involves. For development or division into individual monads involves the assumption that the potentiality for such development is contained in the universal principle ab initio. There is thus an initial modification or qualification of the real. In Professor Whitehead's phrase, the real must be conceived of as being qualified by " a patience for " development and division, and not only for development and division but for just that development and division which the conception of central as opposed to subordinate monads and of monads originally connected by affinities involves. But a real which contains within itself the seeds of division and difference, and of division along certain lines and not others, and differences of a certain sort and not others, is not a unity but</page><page sequence="14">134 C. E. M. JOAD. a plurality. Given a plurality, I am prepared to grant that the problem of free will assumes a very different complexion: given a unity it seems to me insoluble, if only because the problem of how a unity can develope the differences which individuality implies is insoluble. (4) Let us assume, however, that starting from a reality which is one vital principle, we have solved the problem of differentia- tion into individuals, and are faced with a world of beings who are constituted by groups of spiritual monads embodying special- ized expressions of the vital principle, among which a central monad is directive. And let us with M. Geley and Schopenhauer locate the seat of individuality in the central monad, or, if this alternative be preferred, in the particular arrangement or con- formation of the group. Are we any nearer a solution of the free will problem ? It is clear that the motive power of the individual's thoughts and actions must be derived from the energy and flow of the vital principle animating the central monad which is his Self. It is further clear that his general characteristics will follow directly from the nature of the central monad or from the peculiarities of the grouping of the subordinate monads. But in this event does not the difficulty of self-determinism immediately confront us ? A man, says Aristotle, does good actions (A) because he is a good man (a). He becomes a good man (a) through doing good actions (B). He did good actions (B) because he was the sort of good man (b) who would do that kind of good actions. He became a good man (b) through doing good actions (C), and so on indefinitely until we are enabled to trace the whole of a man's subsequent desires and activities back to his initial disposition, or to the initial potentialities for such and such a disposition which he contained within himself at birth. But what is this disposition, or rather, what are these poten- tialities for such and such a disposition on the basis of the</page><page sequence="15">THE PROBLEM OF FREE WILL. 135 view we have been considering ? A peculiar grouping of monads, or certain defining characteristics of a central monad. Thus a man's activities are initially determined throughout. They are determined in two ways. (i) By the special individuation of the vital principle in the central monad, and the resulting characteristics of that monad. These characteristics determine the future development of the individual and the nature of his reactions to environment and circumstance. If everything we think and do is ultimately derivable from a natal disposition, and if this natal disposition is itself a certain determination of the vital principle, then the vital principle must throughout be held responsible for the characteristics and resultant actions of that individuation of itself which constitutes the Self. If, in short, A is an expression and nothing but an expression of B, then everything that happens in A can only so happen as a result of something that has first happened in B. If something were to happen in A which had not its corresponding and pre- determining counterpart in B, this something could only happen in virtue of the fact that A was not wholly an expression of B but was, in fact, something other than such an expression. But this is precisely what no Vitalist theory which holds that the vital principle constitutes the whole of reality can allow. (ii) By the continuous operation of the vital principle within him, which is conceived of as supplying the motive force of every action, and the nisus of every desire. If we ask why A performed action B, we may answer that it was because A was impelled to do B; and if we ask, again why A was impelled to do B, we must answer again because A's was the sort of self that had impulses of that particular kind. A's actions in fact are determined by his impulses, and his impulses by his Self. Now there is no particular objection to this sort of analysis from the free-willist point of view, provided that the Self be conceived of as a free</page><page sequence="16">136 C. E. M. JOAD. and independent agent. Self-determinism in this event is simply another name for free will. But when the Self is simply a localized portion of a vital principle, it is clear that this deter- mining factor can reside nowhere but in the vital principle, or, more accurately, in that special conformation of itself effected by itself which constitutes the Self. The location of the citadel of the Self in the unconscious does not improve matters. M. Geley holds, as stated above, that the essential portion of the Self is of the very essence of the uncon- scious " and brings the individual into touch with that which is divine in the universe," by which, I take it, he means the vital principle itself. This part of the unconscious, presumably to be identified with the central monad, is unaffected by bodily dis- solution and the dispersal of the group of subordinate monads whose coming together constitutes the whole individual. A succession of consciousnesses invests this permanent uncon- scious thereby creating a succession of individuals, much as a number of beads are strung together on a cord. But the unconscious does not remain unaffected by these " incarnations " in successive temporary consciousnesses. The conscious acqui- sitions of one life are stored in the unconscious and appear as the innate gifts of the next. Thus the good luck of life the second is the unconscious wisdom of the man who has been consciously wise in life the first; the faculties and intellectual aptitudes of life the second are the unconscious version of the conscious knowledge of life the first. The unconscious so qualified determines for M. Geley all the activities of the conscious. Like the unconscious of the psycho-analysts it is responsible alike for the nature, the strength and the appearance of the desires which appear in the conscious, and like the unconscious of the psycho- analysts it divests the conscious of responsibility. That such a theory does destroy the notion of conscious responsibility may be easily seen. It is clear in the first place</page><page sequence="17">THE PROBLEM OF FREE WILL. 137 that, if the source of all our desires is to be located in the uncon- scious, we are not responsible for the fact of desire. It might still be held, however, that we are responsible either (a) for its direction or character, or (b) for its strength. As regards (a) the direction or character of a desire will depend upon the extent to which it is, to adopt the language of the psycho-analysts, distorted or sublimated by the censor or some equivalent psycho- logical fiction on its way from the unconscious to the conscious. This sublimation or distortion may be very marked, so that an unconscious desire to elope with the housemaid may appear in the conscious as a sudden distaste for fish for breakfast; but as the operations of the censor are normally held to be outside consciousness, it is clear that we are not responsible for the shape into which this faculty moulds our primitive desires. As regards (b) it is clear that the strongest desire which we have at any moment will determine our actions. Such a desire can only be inhibited in virtue of a stronger desire to suppress it. It is not, in the last resort, reason or moral sense that makes us stay at home and read for an examination instead of going to the cinema, wvhich, as we put it, is what we want to do, but a desire to pass the examination, or, as Aristotle would say, a desire for the good of the whole which is stronger than the desire to go to the cinema. Now if both these desires have their main- spring in the unconscious, it is clear that we are no more respon- sible for their strength than for their appearance. If it be objected that we diminish or inhibit the cinema desire not by another desire, but by a controlling or suppressing act of Will, it may be pointed out- (i) That if you do not know what is going on in your uncon- scious, it is clear that you cannot control it. (ii) That according to these theories, the unconscious itself is, as we have tried to show, an expression of the vital principle, which is therefore realizing itself in all the desires it projects into consciousness. (iii) That p</page><page sequence="18">138 C. E. M. JOAD. even if we could suppress these desires by will, we could only do so in virtue of some force within us which must itself be necessarily derived from the vital principle. Even, therefore, if we assume that the vital principle could be in some way turned against itself, it is clear that the responsibility for the conflict between warring impulses and for the ultimate victory of one over the other belongs not to us but to the vital principle. It seems to me that the above conclusions follow from any theory of Vitalism which asserts that there is only one real thing or one form of reality in the Universe. They follow because (1) A reality of this type being conceived of as a unity cannot from within itself evolve the principle of difference which is a condition of its manifestation in indi- viduals. (2) If there is nothing except this principle in the Universe, the occurrence of difference or division cannot be accounted for from without, e.g., by a clash between the vital principle and some external obstruction. (3) Even if we assume an objectification of the vital principle in individuals, no satisfactory account can be given either (a) of the relationship between the principle and the individuals, or (b) of how the individual is to avoid being determined both generally and in each individual action by the vital principle. I do not think, however, that these conclusions follow if a funda- nmental plurality or even duality be admitted. III. In order, therefore, that this paper may not be impugned on the ground of mere destructiveness, I propose to indicate very briefly one set of conditions which seems to me to be such that, if the conditions could be satisfied within the framework of the Vitalist hypothesis, their operation would preserve at least a certain measure of free will for the individual.</page><page sequence="19">THE PROBLEM OF FREE WILL. 139 The most important of these conditions is a fundamental dualism. This seems to me to be necessary, both in order that the objectification of the vital principle in a number of individual units should be possible, and in order that the individuals so constituted should be gifted with the power of independent action, independent, that is to say, of the vital principle. I postulate a vital principle because on this point the argu- ments of Bergson and M. Geley against the mechanist view of evolution seem to me conclusive. But, in order that the vital principle may individualize itself, it appears to be necessary that something other than itself should interrupt or withstand it, thereby constituting an obstacle which it must overcome. I conceive, therefore, of this vital principle appearing in a Uni- verse of chaos and deadness and matter (matter being defined according to the latest fashion in physics), which existed anterior to it. I conceive of it as endeavouring to instil into this world the principle of life and consciousness by imposing order on chaos and infusing vitality into matter. In order to accomplish this purpose it requires tools or weapons but has none save those it can make for itself. Now the only material of which these weapons can be constructed is matter, since nothing save matter and the vital principle exist in the Universe. The vital principle accordingly objectifies itself in matter, dashing itself against it much as a river does against a breakwater, and, in so doing, dispersing itself into innumerable fragments. These fragments are the vital units which we call individuals. But matter, unable to resist the humiliation of being used by the vital principle as a weapon against itself, is, nevertheless, able to impede the full realization of the purpose of the principle. The vital principle uses matter for its weapon, but it does so at a price. And the price it has to pay is that the matter that it employs is enabled to insulate the current of the vital principle</page><page sequence="20">140 THE PROBLEM OF FREE WILL. that animates it so that the insulated portion of the vital prin- ciple becomes as it were its own master. Matter in fact acts as a barrier between the vital principle and the individualized portion of it; the principle gets through, but the portion that does get through is cut off from the main stream and is enabled to function independently. The use of a simile may serve to illustrate this conception. Let us suppose that a river meets an obstacle in its course which diverts a portion of the main river into a side stream. The flow and current of the side stream will be derived from the main river, will in fact be the flow and current of the main river, but its direction will be different, and will be different as the result of the interposition of the material obstacle which has diverted it. Its course will in fact now be dictated by its own reaction to the conformation of its banks, that is, by its reaction to its environment. Similarly the in- dividual, though animated by the vital principle, is enabled to pursue his own course owing to the interposition of matter. It is impossible to pursue this conception here, but I should like in conclusion to apologize both for the paradox of deriving free will from matter, and for the inordinate anthropomorphism of my language.</page></plain_text>
