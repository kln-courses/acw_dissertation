<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Scientific Materialism, by Mario Bunge. Dordrecht, Holland: D. Reidel Publishing Company, 1981. Pp. xiv, 212. Materialism, Bunge tells us, is at present undeveloped, uninteresting and inefficient. As a body o√≠ belief (rather than rigorous philosophy), it is mostly obsolete and irrelevant and many of its defenders are vulgar and crass. Bunge in fact has little to say about existing schools of mate- rialism, for the real question, as he sees it, is whether anything can be done to rescue materialism from its sorry plight - to revitalize and update it. Something can. Although Bunge thinks very little of materialism's vulgar and crass defenders, he is enthusiastic about the importance of materialism itself. He describes it as "the ontology of science and tech- nology" (p. xiii) and the driving force behind a number of scientific breakthroughs, which include atomic and nuclear physics, the study of the origin of life, and recent advances in paleoanthropology and histo- riography. To fulfill its role, however, materialism must be brought into the twentieth century so that vague beliefs can be transformed into stated hypotheses through the medium of logic, mathematics and sci- ence. Most materialist philosophers have expressed themselves in ordi- nary language which is "incurably fuzzy and poor" (p. 17), and hence their propositions have been sloppy and inexact. Bunge therefore con- ducts much of his argument in this volume through mathematical for- mulae: those (like this reviewer) who don't really feel at home speaking the "rich" languages of maths and logic be warned! Bunge calls his version of materialism scientific because it is, he argues, inspired by and tested through the advance of science. It is not mechanical materialism, which would deny any qualitative differences between organisms and non-living things. It is not dialectical material- ism since dialectics (of which more later) is "fuzzy and remote from sci- ence" (p. 41), nor is it historical materialism since, says Bunge, this theory boils down to economic determinism and has to postulate an immaterial superstructure . Contrary to all these, Bunge's materialism is an emergent materialism, which avoids reductionism by stressing that all systems possess properties which are absent from the elements from which they are composed. To quote: Should anyone distrust emergence she should think of this. It is estimated that the going market price of the elementary components of the human body - i.e., carbon, nitrogen, 485</page><page sequence="2">486 SCIENCE 8c SOCIETY calcium, iron, etc. - is about one dollar. On the other hand the market price of the biomolecules (DNA, RNA, proteins, etc.) of our body is about six million dollars. It has been said that this is the price of information; I would say that it is the price of emergent structure (p. 27). There is much in this argument which should, I think, appeal to Marx- ist philosophers. The dematerialization thesis (usually argued on the basis of contemporary physics) is vigorously rebutted and Bunge's insistence that science has no use for a radical inde ter minism seems correct. Chapter 6 on "Mind Evolving" stresses the importance of evo- lutionary psychology and the need to tackle both the discontinuities and the continuity of the evolutionary process, while Chapter 8 contains a lively demolition of Popper's somewhat unworldly World 3 - a verita- ble monster of traditional metaphysics postulated by the self-styled slayer of objective idealism! Yet Bunge's insistence that scientific materialism is emergent and not dialectical will puzzle many Marxist readers. Bunge concedes that dialectical materialism is "the most encompassing, popular and influen- tial philosophy today" (p. 31), but he charges it with dogmatism and inexactness! True, the quantity-quality thesis does make good sense and may even be true, but, in general, dialectics suffers from "impreci- sion, superficiality, unwarranted claims of universality, and disregard for counterexamples" (p. 63). At best, "dialectical ontology has a plausi- ble kernel surrounded by a mystical fog" (p. 41). Three problems in particular arise with Bange's critique. The first is that Bunge formu- lates dialectics in terms some of which are quite unacceptable to any serious-minded dialectical materialist. To speak of dialectics in terms of "antithings" and "antiproperties" (pp. 43-44) does indeed make the phi- losophy sound as metaphysical and obscurantist as Bunge suggests. But which classical practitioner of dialectics ever employed terms such as these? Second problem: Bunge's use of anthropomorphic language. Bunge argues that two hydrogen atoms should be thought of as cooperating rather than opposing one another in forming a hydrogen molecule, but while this tells us something about Bunge's political anxi- eties (dialectics, he says, "renders people obsessed with conflict," p. 63), as a philosophical commentary on the natural sciences it is surely sus- pect and eccentric. Thirdly, Bunge's rejection of the universality of dia- lectics poses problems for his own version of materialism. Every entity, Bunge argues, is "dynamicist": it is "changeable - to be is to become" (p. 30). On the other hand, dialectical theory overlooks the fact that some entities are not contradictory: according to contemporary physics electronics and photons have no inner contradictions (p. 48). How then is it supposed that such entities are intrinsically changeable? If it is impermissibly universalist to think that they are, then what of Bunge's</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 487 own dynamicist principle intended to cover all entities without excep- tion? Rejecting dialectics must, it seems to me, pose problems for a con- sistent materialism. Bunge also gets himself into difficulties on this score through opposition to reflection theory and his fictionalist view (as he calls it) of logical constructs (p. 60), while his analysis of society is dangerously vulnerable. Every social process, he argues, involves inter- action between the biological, the cultural and the political. There is "no prime mover," not even in the admittedly complex sense of a "determinant in the last instance." So what? Bunge asserts (rightly, I think) that cultural items should not themselves be seen as "material things" (p. 134) for they have no existence detached from their crea- tors. But if the principle of mere interaction is substituted for that of primacy (albeit within a framework of multi-causality), then why not contend that sometimes thinkers create their ideas and sometimes ideas create the thinkers? Unless material or economic production is particu- larly important, then dualism surely follows, and a materialist theory of society falls apart. In short, this book, as lively and challenging as it is, demonstrates once again the problem of trying to construct a viable philosophical materialism without dialectics.
