Religious tradition ascribes authorship of the Pentateuch?the first five books of the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament?to Moses, but scholars agree that it is in fact a composite work consisting of texts by several different authors, woven together around 400 B.CE. by a master editor known as the Redactor, or R. The oldest of these texts, running through Genesis, Exodus, and Numbers, was written by the author whom scholars callJ, probably in the tenth century B.CE. HAROLD BLOOM Introduction In Jerusalem, nearly three thousand years ago, an unknown author composed a work that has formed the spiritual consciousness of much of the world ever since. We possess only a fragmentary text of that work, embedded within what we call Genesis, Exodus, and Numbers, three of the divisions of Torah, or the Five Books of Moses. Since we cannot know the circumstances under which the work was composed, or for what pur poses, ultimately we must rely upon our experience as readers to justify our surmises as to what it is that we are reading. Scholarship, however deeply grounded, can reach no agreement upon the dating of what I am calling the Book of J, or upon its surviving dimensions, or even upon whether it ever had an independent existence at all. For reasons that I will expound, I am assuming that J lived at or nearby the court of Solomon's son and successor, King Rehoboam of Judah, under whom his father's kingdom fell apart soon after the death of Solomon in 922 B.CE. My further assumption is that J was not a professional scribe but rather an immensely sophisticated, highly placed member of the Solomonic elite, enlightened and ironic. But my primary surmise is that J was a woman, and that she wrote for her contempo raries as a woman, in friendly competition with her only strong rival among those contemporaries, the male author of the court history narrative in 2 Samuel. Since I am aware that my vision of J will be condemned as a fancy or a fiction, I will begin by pointing out that all our accounts of the Bible are scholarly fictions or religious fantasies, and generally serve rather tendentious purposes. In proposing that J was a woman, at least I will not be furthering the interests of any religious or ideological group. Rather, I will be attempting to account, through my years of reading experience, for my increasing sense of the astonishing differences between J and every other biblical writer. THE TOWER OF BABEL: TRANSLATING J Commentary by Harold Bloom Translated by David Rosenberg One of our many difficulties in reading J as J is the lasting literary power of the King James Bible, or Authorized Version (1611). That Bible, never to be surpassed in English, revises many previous transla tors, but two great writers in particular, the martyred William Tyndale and Miles Coverdale. The style first developed by Tyndale, and amplified by Coverdale, has become biblical style in English, and has had an effect upon writing in English second only to that of Shakespeare. Tyndale, the pioneer in translating directly from the Hebrew Bible into English, translated the Pentateuch with a homely power (1530), and Coverdale, who knew little Hebrew, maintained the base of Tyndale's rough elo quence while adding his own extraordinary flair for English prose rhythm (1535). The Geneva Bible (1560), put together by English Cal vinist exiles, stands out among many subsequent revisions of Tyndale and Coverdale because it was the text used by Shakespeare, with fre quent effect throughout his work. The King James Version can be con sidered essentially a correction, as the Geneva Bible was, of Tyndale Coverdale, and most of its literary strength can be traced back to those pioneers. I am not much impressed by any of the subsequent Christian or secular translations of the Hebrew Bible into English, because they lack the plain power of Tyndale and the lyrical force of Coverdale. JewishvBible translation pragmatically began with the Septuagint, the Greek version of the Hebrew Bible prepared in the third century B.CE. for the great Alexandrian Jewish community. The Septuagint (from the Latin for "the Seventy" translators who were supposed to have finished the work in seventy-two days on the island of Pharos) was considered sacred by the Jews until the Christians adopted it as their official text for what they called the Old Testament. Jewish vernacular versions since the Septuagint include the ancient Aramaic Targum Onkelos and Aramaic Pseudo-Jonathan, the Arabic version of Saadia Gaon in the tenth century CE., and the modern American versions of the Jewish Publica tion Society (1917,1985). Unfortunately, the American Jewish versions, despite their scholarly accuracy, compare poorly with the King James Bible in literary value. In particular, all flavor of J has vanished in those versions, whereas much of J's strength (though little enough of her indi viduality) can still be felt in the text founded upon the Tyndale-Coverdale base. The primary virtue I find in David Rosenberg's translation of what we have ventured to call the Book of J is that he has preserved the Yahwist's ironic tone and stance, while remembering throughout how individual her irony is. I want to illustrate this by contrasting four versions of the Tower of Babel, Genesis 11:1-9. In order I give Tyndale, King James, E. A. Speiser's Anchor Genesis, which I prefer to the Ameri can Jewish Version, and finally Rosenberg. And all the world was of one tonge and one language. And as theg came from the east, theg founde a plague in the lande ofSgnear, and there theg dwelled And theg 8ogd one to a nothen Come on, let us make brgcke and burne it wgth fgre. So brgcke was there stone and slgme was there morter. And theg sagd: Come on, let us buglde us a cgte and a toure, that the toppe mag reach unto heaven. And let us make us a name, for peraventure we shall be skatered abrode over all the erth. And the LORde came down to see the cgte and the toure which the children of Adam had buylded And the LORde sayd: See, the people is one and have one tonge amonge them all And thy s have theg begon to do, andwyll not leave of from all that theg have purposed to do. Come on, let us descende and myngell their tonge even there, that one understonde not what a nother sayetfu Thus the LORde skatered them from thence uppon all the erth. And theg left of to buglde the cgte. Wherfore the name of it is called Babeu\ because that the LORde there confounded the tonge of all the world. And because that the LORde from thence, skatered them abroad uppon all the erth. * And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech. And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter. And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech. So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city. Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there con found the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth. The whole world had the same language and the same words. As men migrated from the east, theg came upon a valley in the land of Shinar and settled there. Theg said to one another, "Come, let us mold bricks and burn them hard "Brick served them for stone, and bitumen for mortar. Then theg said, "Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower with its top in the skg, to make a name for ourselves; else we shall be scattered all over the world" Yahweh came down to look at the city and the tower that the earthlings had built And Yahweh said, "If this is how theg have started to act, while theg are one people with a single language for all, then nothing that theg mag presume to do will be out of their reach. Let me, then, go down and confound their speech there, so that theg shall not understand one another's talk." Yahweh dispersed them from there over the whole earth, and theg stopped building the citg. That is whg it was named Babel, since Yahweh confounded the speech of the whole world, as he dispersed them from there over the whole world * Now listen: all the earth uses one tongue, one and the same words. Watch: they journey from the east, arrive at a valley in the land of Sumer, settle there. 44 We can bring ourselves together,'' they said,44 like stone on stone, use brick for stone: bake it until hard." For mortar they heated bitumen. 44 If we bring ourselves together," they said,44 we can build a city and tower, its top touching the sky?to arrive at fame. Without a name we're unbound, scattered over the face of the earth." Yahweh came down to watch the city and tower the sons of man were bound to build. "They are one people, with the same tongue," said Yahweh. "They con ceive this between them, and it leads up until no boundary exists to what they will touch. Between us, let's descend, baffle their tongue until each is scatterbrain to his friend." From there Yahweh scattered them over the whole face of earth; the city there came unbound. That is why they named the place Bavel: their tongues were baffled there by Yahweh. Scattered by Yahweh from there, they arrived at the ends of the earth. Tyndale ruggedly catches J's fundamental wordplay between balai, "confused" and Babel or Babylon, and his fine word ''confounded'' is PAGE 28 THE AMERICAN POETRY REVIEW</page><page sequence="3">retained in King James and by Speiser. Rosenberg's "baffle their tongue" plays on baled and Babel, so that Babylon becomes a universe of bafflement. This reinforces Rosenberg's care in repeating the subtle J's play upon "bound," "boundary," "unbound." J's Yahweh curses the snake with a crucial setting of boundaries. 44 Since you did this, you are bound apart from flocks, from any creature of the field, bound to the ground, crawling by your smooth belly: dirt you shall taste from first day to last. I make you enemy to woman, enmity bound between your seed and hers." This belongs to the same complex as Yahweh's warning to Moses: 4 4 The people will be a boundary, warn them to watch themselves, approach but not climb up, not touch the mountain. For those who overstep boundaries, death touches them, steps over their graves." J plays incessantly, in these passages and elsewhere, upon the Hebrew stem Vr, which means "to restrain or bind, as by a magical spell." In J, Vr is not quite a curse but does constitute an antithesis to the Blessing of Yahweh, in which time loses its boundaries. My penultimate section in this book, "The Blessing: Exiles, Boundaries, Jealousies," deals in part with this complex. Rosenberg's version of Babel seems to me admirable at bringing into American English the Yahwist's ironic playfulness with binding and unbinding, boundaries and the unbounded. The men of what will be called Babel, after it is scattered or unbound, converge on the site in order to make a common purpose and name, implicitly against Yahweh. To become men with a name, so that one's renown is not scattered, is to be like the Nephilim, those "giants in the earth" who were the children of the mismatches of the Elohim and earthly women (Gen. 6:4). Bringing or binding themselves together in alliance, the men of Babel compare themselves to building stones, hard-baked bricks of resentment against oblivion. To be nameless is to be unbound and scat tered, and Yahweh descends to brifcg about just that when he comes down "to watch the city and tower the sons of man were bound to build." They are "bound to build, ' ' covenanted to one another yet also overdeter mined by their ambitions. Hence Yahweh's grimly deliberate irony. 44They are one people, with the same tongue. They conceive this between them, and it leads up until no boundary exists to what they will touch. Between us, let's descend, baffle their tongue until each is scatterbrain to his friend." But we hear also a dramatic irony, intended not by Yahweh but by J. Yahweh's "between us" must be addressed to the Elohim, or angels, his own creatures, not his friends or fellow building stones. Impish to a high degree, Yahweh overthrows by mischief, the baffling or confusion of lan guages. The scatterbrains indeed will be scattered, will become men without a name, because they would reach beyond Yahweh's boundaries, as though they were commensurate with the incommensurate. Scattered, their city unbound, stone falling away from stone, "they arrived at the ends of the earth." All the world has become Babylon, permanently baffled. The play of J's language emerges in Rosenberg's version as it does not in Tyndale, King James, or Speiser. That verbal play tends to give our dramatic sympathies to the builders of Babel even as we appre hend the fierce irony of J's Yahweh. As always, what we are likeliest to miss in J when we read her previous translators is given back to us by Rosenberg. * * * A summit of J's art, the Tower of Babel can best be introduced by its legitimate modern heir, Kafka's "The Great Wall of China." Kafka writes of a scholar who maintained that the Great Wall alone would provide for the first time in the history of mankind a secure foundation for a new Tower of Babel. First the wall, therefore, and then the tower. . .. Human nature, essentially changeable, unstable as the dust, can endure no restraint; if it binds itself it soon begins to tear madly at its bonds, until it rends everything asunder, the wall, the bonds, and its very self. Kafka thus finds in the impulse to build the tower the same force that will destroy the tower. Is that J's judgment also? The question of J's tone, her stance, is again at the center of the problem of interpretation. All of mankind, united by one language, seeks to keep its name from being scattered, through the building of a tower touching the sky. The purpose is fame rather than rebellion against Yahweh, though to seek fame is necessarily to rebel against Yahweh. All rush to be like the giants in the land and to achieve renown. Yahweh, though he presumably has a perfectly good view of what is going on, descends to enjoy one of his on the-ground inspections. His reaction is akin to his judgment that Adam and Eve must be expelled from Eden lest they devour the fruit of the Tree of Life. A united humankind seems not much to Yahweh's taste. 44 They are one people, with the same tongue," said Yahweh.4 4They conceive this between them, and it leads up until no boundary exists to what they will touch. Between us, let's descend, baffle their tongue until each is scatterbrain to his friend." Whether Yahweh is speaking to his angels or, more characteristically, to himself, he reveals again that he is, in J, an antithetical imp or sublime mischief-maker, in no way morally or spiritually superior to the builders of Babel, except insofar as his own tongue certainly is not baffled. Man kind builds the tower, but Yahweh invents Babel or bafflement, the con fusion of tongues. We seek fame, and Yahweh scatters us, that every name be scattered also, except his own. Babylon or babbling is where Yahweh wishes us to live, except insofar as we become children of Abraham, once Abram has become Abraham. J mothered Kafka but interprets the parable of Babel rather more darkly even than he does. She sees also that we can endure no restraint, but she does not find in us the force that overthrows the tower even as the same force built it. Her tower is no Great Wall of China, unstable dust aspiring to be a stable foundation for a tower that might jacket heaven. Her tower is a broken tower to begin with, since that which rises against Yahweh must be broken by Yahweh. Incommensurateness is, as always, her rhetoric and her theme alike. We are godlike or theomorphic, or can be, but we cannot be Yahweh, even if we are David. Yahweh is irony, and not just the spirit of irony. Perhaps he is th? irony of mere maleness, when seen from ?Ts marvelous perspective. We are children always, and so we build the Tower of Babel. ?Ts Yahweh is a child also, a powerful and uncanny male child, and he throws down what we build up. He blesses or he scatters; we are scattered unless, like Abram, we hear and answer a call. EDEN Commentary by Harold Bloom Translated by David Rosenberg 4 "It is no good the man be alone," said Yahweh. "I will make a partner to stand beside him." So Yahweh shaped out of the soil all the crea tures of the field and birds of the air, bringing them to the man to see how he would call them. Whatever the man called became the living creature's name. Soon all wild animals had names the man gave them, all birds of the air and creatures of the field, but the man did not find his partner among them. Now Yahweh put the man into a deep sleep; when he fell asleep, he took a rib, closed the flesh of his side again. Starting with the part taken out of the man, Yahweh shaped the rib into woman, returned her to the side of the man. "This one is bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh," said the man. "Woman I call her, out of man she was parted." So a man parts from his mother and father, clings to his wife: they were one flesh. And look: they are naked, man and woman, untouched by shame, not knowing it. 5 Now the snake was smoother-tongued than any wild creature that Yahweh made. "Did the God really mean," he said to the woman, "you can't eat from any tree of the garden?" "But the fruit of the trees we may," said the woman to the snake. "Just the tree in the middle of the garden, the God said. You can't eat from it, you can't touch?without death touching you." "Death will not touch you," said the snake to the woman. "The God knows on the day you eat from it your eyes will fall open like gods, knowing good and bad." Now the woman sees how good the tree looks, to eat from, how lovely to the eyes, lively to the mind. To its fruit she reached; ate, gave to her man, there with her, and he ate. And the eyes of both fall open, grasp knowledge of their naked skin. They wound together fig leaves, made coverings for themselves. 6 Now they hear Yahweh's voice among the evening breezes, walking in the garden; they hide from the face of Yahweh, the man and his woman, among trees of the garden. "Where are you?" Yahweh called to the man. I-?-1 NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 1990 PAGE 29</page><page sequence="4">"I heard your voice in the garden/' he answered. "I trembled, I knew I was smooth-skinned, I hid." "Who told you naked is what you are?" he asked. "Did you touch the tree I desired you not eat?" "The woman you gave to stand beside me?she gave me fruit of the tree, I ate." 7 "What is this you have done?" said Yahweh to the woman. "The smooth-tongued snake gave me, I ate." "Since you did this," said Yahweh to the snake, "you are bound apart from flocks, from any creature of the field, bound to the ground, crawling by your smooth belly: dirt you shall taste from first day to last. I make you enemy to woman, enmity bound between your seed and hers. As you strike his heel, he shall strike your head." 8 To the woman he said: "Pain increasing, groans that spread into groans: having children will be labor. To your man's body your belly will rise, for he will be eager above you." To the man he said: "You bent to your woman's voice, eager to eat?from the tree of which you knew my desire: * You will not eat from it.' Now: bitter be the soil to your taste; in labor you will bend to eat from it, each day you live. "Thorns and thistles will bloom before you; you will grasp the bitter herbs the field gives you. "As you sow the sweat of your face so you will reap your bread, till you return to earth?from it you were taken. Dust you are, to dust you return." 9 The man named his wife Hava: she would have all who live, smooth the way, mother. Now Yahweh made clothes from skins of the wild animals for the man and woman, dressed them. Before death is introduced again, J plays out the lovely fable of the creation of woman, a highly original fable since, as I remarked earlier, we have no other extant account of the creation of woman from the ancient Middle East. The ironies of J's fable encompass Yahweh and Adam, but not at all the still nameless first woman. Misogyny in the West is a long and dismal history of weak misreading of the comic J, who exalts women throughout her work, and never more than in this deliri ously wry story of creation. The lack of a sense of humor in believers and exegetes always has been and remains the largest barrier to the under standing of J. How does one read the creation of woman? Yahweh reflects that it is not good for man to be alone, and resolves to make a partner to stand beside his creature. So Yahweh shaped out of the soil all the creatures of the field and birds of the air, bringing them to the man to see how he would call them. Whatever the man called became the living creature's name. Soon all wild animals had names the man gave them, all birds of the air and creatures of the field, but the man did not find his partner among them. "Helpmate," our now discredited term for a wife (or a husband), comes directly from the King James version of a partner to stand beside one: "I will make him an help meet for him" (Gen. 2:18). That is an eloquent mistranslation of J, whose Hebrew means "equal to him" or "alongside him," where the "help," far from being subservient or auxiliary, translates a word later used for Yahweh's relationship to us. J's Yahweh seeks a correspondent being for Adam, as earlier Yahweh imparted to Adam a correspondent breeze. Is it Yahweh's joke, or ?Ts, that the quest for that being begins with shaping out of the clay all the animals and birds? The quest is for naming, and part of the joke is that Adam does not name his woman other than as woman when at last he receives her as fit partner. When we consider Adam's task of naming, we often do not remember that what is being named is precisely what is not fit to mend Adam's solitude. J's insight is Nietzschean long before Nietzsche: that which we find words for is that which we cannot hold in our heart. Yahweh, presumably confounded, resorts to what Keats calls Adam's dream, a dream from which we wake to find it true. The deep sleep, tardemah, into which Yahweh puts Adam is J's profound metaphor for the mystery of love, or of what Freud reductively called "object choice." Adam's heavy sleep is not natural, its function being anesthetic, and J slyly hints that man's love for woman is essentially narcissistic, related to the greater mystery of birth. In some sense, what Adam experiences is the only male instance of giving birth. Adam's rib is shaped or built by Yahweh, in one of J's curious wordplays, since the word for "rib" is a structural term inevitably employed in the account of any building operation. But we should stand back here and contrast Yahweh as the artificer of the woman with Yahweh as the much more childlike and haphazard creator of the man. It is not just that J has given six times the space to woman's creation as to man's; it is the difference between making a mud pie and building a much more elaborate and fairer structure. The man provides (involuntarily) the substance with which Yahweh begins this second and greater creation. But that means the woman is created from a living being, and not from clay. Presumably she is animate, and Yahweh need not inspirit her nostrils. Surely J's ironic point is that the second time around, Yahweh has learned better how the job ought to be done. I do not interpret Yahweh's actio? in bringing the woman to Adam as that of an attendant at a wedding, or even of a father giving away the bride. J is not in the business, as we will see many times, of endorsing marriage as such, let alone of considering Yahweh the establisher and sanctifier of marriage. J's wryness does not cease at any moment in this sequence. No one has hinted so shrewdly at the limits of sexual love: that it unites in act but not in essence. Parting is played off against clinging, which is revealed as inadequate to overcome parting. We part from mother and father, rather as the woman was parted from Adam. Clinging cannot make us one flesh, and no man since Adam can say, "Bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh." Adam and his woman were one flesh, but we only cling, at best. We are asked to look again at Adam and the woman, because we are moving to the smoothness or slyness of the serpent, a smoothness that is his equivalent of their shameless nakedness. J's remarkable pun here is quite famous, but not always very acutely interpreted. And look: they are naked [smooth], man and woman, untouched by shame, not knowing. Now the snake was smoother- tongued than any wild creature that Yahweh made. The Hebrew 'arom is "naked": 'arum is "shrewd, subtle, sly." "Smooth" is the best American vernacular equivalent for the pun, as in "a smooth customer." The man and the woman do not know slyness; the serpent knows nothing else. Our problem, as J's readers, is to disentangle her story of the serpent in Eden from the scandalous prominence it has achieved in Christian theology and in Western imaginative literature. It is an enormous challenge to recover J at this point in particular. How did the charming serpent of J ever become Satan? The answer seems to go back at least to the first century before the common era, to certain apocalyptic Jewish heretical writings, including the Testament of Adam, the Life of Adam and Eve, and the curiously misti tied Apocalypse of Moses. Behind them is a lost life or apocalypse of Adam, where presumably the Devil and J's serpent first merged, where J's story of disobedience was transmuted to one of lust, and where the tree of the knowledge of good and bad vanished into just any tree at all that could be associated with the serpent who is Satan. Normative rabbis and their Gnostic opponents alike misread J's original story until the opposing readings were subsumed by Saint Augustine's Christian allegorizings. J thinks of the man and the woman as disobedient children, and of the serpent as a smooth imp. Lust is an obsession of dualists, who see soul and body as caught in a wrestling match, but J, as I have shown, was no dualist and so was not much concerned with lust. That returns us to Eden, and to J's smooth play upon nakedness and slyness. The nakedness of the man and the woman is their childlike astuteness, even as the slyness of the serpent is its nakedness, its quality of being wholly natural, as much at home in Eden as they are. The child's nakedness is virtually identical with the serpent's astuteness, and neither is attached to shame or excessive self-consciousness. Our given endowment, for J, has in it no original shame or original guilt. Solomonic culture, we can infer, was neither a shame culture, like the Homeric, nor a guilt culture, like the Christian. Adam and his still nameless wife have the vitalistic splendor of David, the complete human being, Yahweh's favorite, and such heroic intensity begins unshadowed by guilt or shame. If the serpent's subtle awareness is its nakedness, then like the human nakedness, such slyness is the serpent's mode of freedom. The serpent is in Eden because it belongs there; its presence, speech, and discernment do not astonish the woman, and so we are not to think of it as magical or PAGE 30 THE AMERICAN POETRY REVIEW</page><page sequence="5">mythological. It is Yahweh's creature, his subtlest, and perhaps we can say now it is Yahweh's most ironical creature. We have no reason to believe the serpent malevolent. J introduces it by remarking upon its leading quality, not upon its intentions, about which she tells us absolutely nothing. The serpent's quest widens conscious ness, through the knowing of good from bad, a discernment Yahweh had capriciously granted to the angels, according to J's contemporary, the author of 2 Samuel. J does not tell us why Yahweh chose not to make the same equivocal gift to the man and the woman, or why the serpent acquired some portion of angelic knowledge. Since the basis for J's style is always ellipsis, we need a close reading to determine what has been left out in such a way as to imply its absence. What is implied here is at once the startling likeness between the Elohim, or angels, and Adam, and the absolute unlikeness between Yahweh and Adam that Yahweh arbitrarily insists upon maintaining. The basis of irony for J is always the clash of incommensurates, a clash that begins in the illusion of commensurate ness. That ancient red herring, anthropomorphism, again threatens to divert us from the center of J's imagination: the theomorphic or divine elements in women and in men. J's irony is subtly balanced yet favors the still nameless woman over Adam, Yahweh, and the serpent. Since normative commentary, particularly Christian exegesis, has made the woman the culprit, this point deserves considerable emphasis. Her reply to the serpent curiously modifies Yahweh's admonition by adding "you can't touch." The taboo of touch is entirely her own and is less a mistake than an ironic revision, exposing how childlike her consciousness can be. "You are not to eat it, indeed you can't even touch it," we say to a child, and we enhance the child's sense of deprivation and powerlessness. The contrast between such a sense and Yahweh's impending punishment vastly augments the sympathetic pathos of the first woman. Is the serpent a liar? No, though he tells a half-truth when he insists, "Death will not touch you." Still, he has no sense of temporality, only of immediacy, and he is not aware that his truth is but partial. Nor does he address himself to the woman alone. J's Hebrew implies that Adam is present, hears what the woman hears, and does not resist her act of handing him the fruit. She is the active child, the more curious or imaginative, while Adam's role is that of the child who imitates. We have, then, two children and a natural creature with some preternatural knowledge, the serpent. J has given us no candidates for culpability, except perhaps Yahweh, already portrayed as a bungler in his original creation of candidates fit for Adam. Setting the tree of knowing good and bad as prohibition and temptation is a parallel blunder, the act of a father all too incommensurate with his children, as his subsequent reactions also indicate. What is it to know good and bad? Again the normative mis reading has reduced this issue to the knowledge or consciousness of sexuality, but J has too healthy a view of human sexuality for such a reduction to be relevant or interesting. Good and bad is no less than everything, freedom and limits of freedom, self-knowledge, angehe, almost godlike. When you know yourself, you know your own nakedness, but the consequent shame has no sexual overtones, difficult as norma tive tradition has made this to acknowledge. To open one's eyes is to see everything, all at once, and so to see oneself as others might see one, as an object. But who is there to see the man and the woman except for their maker, Yahweh? They have ceased to be children, at least in their own judgment, and have acquired the slyness of the serpent, even as the serpent metaphorically acquires their nakedness in Yahweh's terrible judgment upon him. What do we, or J, make of Yahweh's judgment upon us? If like a mother he dresses us far more adequately than we can dress ourselves, still we must note what J subtly passes over in silence: the first killing is done by Yahweh in order to clothe us (Gen. 3:21). The choice is Yahweh's, not ours. Though the intimacy of the scene is remarkable, this mode of presentation is inevitable for J. We are witnessing not the Fall of Man and Woman, disobedience followed by a death sentence with a kind of indefinite reprieve, but a family romance transformed into a family tragedy. What is involved is not Fall but a wounding estrangement, an expulsion from home, from a garden where Yahweh, who is both mother and father, likes to walk about while enjoying the cool breezes of the evening. DAVID ROSENBERG A Poet's Prose When I began this work, the first certainty to learn was that J would not use a phrase, not a single word, without playing upon it, sometimes in the same sentence, sometimes in the next. Every word was a fresh one, because the nature of the play, shading from light to grave, was unpredictable. A translation requires that every English word also be chosen with an ear to its tone and weight?and with a healthy skepti cism toward simplification. This poet of narrative makes every sentence of description or dialogue sound as if nothing had been described or said before. In Hebrew J's sentences, like Unes of verse, are strung together in stanzas rather than paragraphs. Since the conventional biblical chapter divisions are arbitrary, made by later editors, I gave J a chapter sequence that more naturally follows the breaks in her narrative. Whether she or her editors are responsible for discontinuities, we can only imagine. More than translation, a reconstruction of the Book of J should risk sensitivity to the original narrative voice. While piecing together chapters and fragments of authoritative J, I imagined the structural density of the original Hebrew, which echoes clearly in many parts of the existing text. I've hoped to restore a measure of its rhythmic gravity. Jewish tradition provided the figure of Moses as leader-writer. Along with David and Solomon, who are author-figures for other biblical books, he embodies the kind of hero we don't have in Western history: a national leader who is also a great poet. In postbiblical Jewish culture, bereft of a nation (until our time), the model of a leader-figure in itself was difficult to imagine, especially one who is a potent artist. Yet in this century we have seen great poets of the Hebrew language, and a lament by Bialik, a mythic story by Agnon, or a sonnet-psalm by Leah Goldberg is comprehensible beside the biblical canon. And that is how the voice of J crystallized for me: it was not until I read the modern Hebrew poets that I could imagine the biblical authors as living men and women. J's stories are told or retold in scenes: as if the author were there when they were happening, as if she were a witness. This poet was not concerned with a conventional storyteller's pose, the marshaling of points of view, but with the stance of the poet: the witness who pares away a needless virtuosity of conventions observed. The intense drama makes the action resonant with poetry: we hear the poet present as she weighs each word and sounds it against the others. The play of word with?and within?word produces a basic poetics of diction and rhyme. It is a diction based on Hebrew phrasing that can only be translated into English if it is recreated. The King James transla tion embodies the standard for English diction but substitutes much of J's ironic stance?the way she shades meaning?with a less modulated grandeur. Later translations, especially recent ones, give up both grandeur and irony in one fell swoop of reduction. Likewise, the rhyme in J is shaded, an off-rhyming in Hebrew, primarily assonance and consonance. To parallel it in English requires an ear for ironic repetitions as well, since a greater range of variations on word roots is possible in Hebrew. Repetitive devices and a sophisticated sense of parallelism characterize J's writing. In his biblical scholarship, Martin Buber dug deep into the use of what he called "word-motifs": "The repetition need not be merely of the word itself but also of the word root; in fact, the very difference of words can often intensify the dynamic action of the repetition. I call it 'dynamic' because between combinations of sounds related to one another in this manner a kind of movement takes place: if one imagines the entire text deployed before him, one can sense waves moving back and forth between the words." At a certain point, describing my work to a poet-colleague, I was asked how old I thought the J writer at the time of writing. I was stunned by the question?or rather, by my not having faced it. I had focused on the major taboo nonreligious readers would have to overcome: to imagine the writer as a human being in the first place. So I confronted her age, found her with enough experience of life and history to be just over forty, with a still vital appetite for life. I realized I was only identifying myself, yet the imaginative health in restoring authorship can nourish a tradi tion limping with taboos.
