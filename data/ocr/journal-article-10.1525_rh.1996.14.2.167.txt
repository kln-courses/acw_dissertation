LAÑE BRUNER  Toward a Poststructural Rhetorical Critical  Praxis: Foucault, Limit Work, and Jenninger's  Kristallnacht Address  Abstract: This essay indicates how the implicit normative  firamework in the texts of Michel Foucault can lead to a poststructural  rhetorical pnixis that is neither relativistic ñor unrealistically utopian.  In relation lo tt»e Enlightenment project broadly conceived, Foucaulf s  woik in this área shows b)oth siniilarities to aiwi differences Érom Kant  and Habermas. Some normative standards are precluded within  Foucault's system, but others are implied and can l&gt;e articulated.  There is a concept of limit work in Foucault, and the essay concludes  by explairüng this concept and applying it to Philipp Jeiminger's  Kristallnacht address.  I would like to produce some effects of truth which might l&gt;e used for  a possible battle, to lie waged by those who wish to wage it, in forms  yet to be found and in organizations yet to be defined.  —Michel Foucault^  his essay is primarily coneerned with waging a battle, a  batt le w h o s e theater has been de f ined by  poststructuralism in general and the work of Michel  Foucault in particular.^ It is a battle against a form of  power that neeessarily resides within diseursive systems, and a  ^Foucault Live: ¡nterviews, 1966-1984. ed.

By clarifying the similarities  and differences between Foucault, Kant, and Habermas in relation  to the Enlightenment "project" broadly conceived, by explicating  the various aspects of Foucault's intellectual trajectory that have  precluded the articulation of certain forms of normative standards  (yet imply others), by detailing how various concepts in Foucault's  texts clarify his notion of limit work, and by applying the notion of  limit work to Philipp Jenninger's fateful Kristallnacht address, I  shall provide a perspective from which rhetorical critics can wage  the "possible battle" for which Foucault himself suggested his  work as a préparation.  First, the explication of Foucault's normative framework and  its potential ramifications for rhetorical criticism is called for  primarily because of the lingering confusión concerrüng the norms  implicit in Foucault's texts and the relative lack of attention to limit  work on the part of rhetorical critics. As diseussed in detall below,  limit work refers to the analysis of the ways in which our identities  are constrained in order to provide the possibility for reflexively  transforming them.* Second, a good deal of work remains to be  various "positions": Michel Foucault, Discipline and Punish (New York: Vintage  Books, 1979); idem, The Archaeology of Knowledge (New York: Pantheon Books,  1972); idem, The Order of Things (New York: Vintage Books, 1970); The FoucauU  Reader, ed. Paul Rabinow (New York: Pantheon Books, 1984); Michel Foucault:  Beyond Structuralism and Hermeneutics, ed. H. L. Dreyfus and P. Rabinow, 2nd ed.  (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1983); and The Cambridge Companion to  Foucault, ed. Gary Gutting (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994).  'Dreyfus and Rabinow, Michel Foucault, p. 212, from the essay 'The Subject  and Power." By the notion of the "violence of identity construction," I refer to the  fact that the articulation of anything requires the suppression of différence, and that  Identity as Concept, or as the Same, requires a bracketing procedure that neeessarily  entails exclusionary practices.  •"For an excellent discussion of the various details of limit work and its  relationshíp to Foucault's scholarship, see Jon Simons, Foucault and the Political  (New York: Routledge, 1995).  </page> <page sequence="3"> Foucault, Limit Work, and Jenninger 169  done in explicating the distinctions between Habermasian and  Foucauldian norms and their ramifications for rhetorical criticism.  For example, in his influential book Norms of Rhetorical Culture,  Thomas Farrell argües that the norms which guide "rhetorical  culture" are predominantly Habermasian, inasmuch as they are  centered around rational audiences and artful rhetors.^ 1 am  arguing that, at the very least, such norms must be eomplemented  by the Foucauldian norms suggested in this essay. Third, while  numerous theoretieal essays on Foucault have been published in  journals concerned with rhetorical crit icism, few critical  applications have appeared that focus speeifically, even implicitly,  on linüt work.^  While the several theoretieal essays that have appeared under  the general rubric of "critical rhetoric" have attempted to outline the  'Thomas Farrell, Norms of Rhetorical Culture (New Haven, CT: Yale University  Press, 1993). For example, Farrell claims that "character in public must constantly  be re-formed and performed through the rhetorical cholees we make in engaging  respor^ible others. [These] responsible others are comp)etent precisely b&gt;ecause they  are able to recognize and enact the relational goods of civic friendship, practical  reason, and hope" (pp. 80-81).  *The following is a complete list of recent theoretieal articles related in one way  or another to Foucault and rhetoric: Carolyn J.

In "Critical Rhetoric:  Theory and Praxis," Raymie McKerrow argües that "Foucault is not  seeking a particular normatíve structure. . . ."^ Additíonally, Naney  Fraser has made a strong argument (later taken up by Habermas)  which concludes that "Foucault's work is normatívely confused."*  In response to statements such as these, Kent Ono and John Sloop  point out that McKerrow's "critíque of freedom," an outgrowth of  his understanding of Foucault, "has the potential to lead to a  shedding of every vestíge of commitment. . . [and] eomnüts a critíe  to a self-critícism from which the critíe could not escape long enough  to provide direction."' Ono and Sloop go on to argüe that "the eritic  is not only committed to a telos by necessity, but that the eritic  should take hold of the threads of that telos . . . and comrrüt to a  purpose ."

While the essay  makes a valuable at tempt to clarify the fact that there is an  emancipatory impulse behind poststructural criticism, its insistence  on a telos of a "non-oppressive language" is, as the following  arguments will reveal, clearly unFoucauldian. Furthermore, this  essay does not speeifically art icúlate a connection between  poststructural norms derived from Foucault's unique perspective on  enlightenment and rhetorical criticism as a practice.

"'^ What  follows, then, is an explicatíon of the ways in which Foucault's texts  do indeed imply a normatíve structure that serves as a framework  for a particular kind of rhetorical criticism that avoids both  relatívism and utopianism, one that focuses on a perpetual critíque  of the necessary limits imposed in the constructíon of identítíes.  Even to begin to artículate anything in today's poststructural  economy of meaning is to assume a great risk, for the artíeulatíon  of anything requires the suppression of différence, and for  contemporary critícal theory "the fundamental concern of theory  has been différence."''' In fact, Foucault has argued that thinkers  must refuse anything that presents itself in the form of simplistíc or  authori tar ian alternatives, which he labels remnants of the  "blackmail" of the Enlightenment. '* But I contend that this  statement can be, and has been, read to mean that we can no longer  assert anything, and such radical conclusions are part and parcel of  the reason why Foucault's valué for social critíque has been sorely  misunders tood or overlooked. Debates among those most  interested in identity politics exemplify the pressing need for a  clarification of the normat ive s t andards that elucídate the  dist inet ion between the suppress ion of différence and the  artíeulatíon of an effectíve poststructural "positíon." For example,  contemporary feminist scholars continué to struggle over the  relatíve valué Foucault's perspectíve holds for identity politícs in  general and feminist identíty politics in partícular.'^ Most of the  debates, I would argüe, are between feminist scholars such as Jana  Sawicki and Judith Butler who recognize the importance of  Foucault's theories for resistíng female subjectívities, and other  feminist scholars such as Isaac Balbus and Lois McNay who  '^"The Humanistic Turn," p. 155.

All of the evidenee points to the fact that Foucault's later work  was moving in a direction that would articúlate the normative  s t andards that guided his own work, and a pos ts t ruc tura l  rhetorical critical practice, like any critical practíce, requires just  such an artíeulatíon. Unfortunately, Foucault died before these  normative s tandards were adequately outlined. Still, while  Foucault was very suspicious of totalizing speech, especially  polenúcal politícal speech, this attítude did not preclude him from  intimating a normative basis for social critique. According to  David Ingram, Foucault's turn to "hermeneutie genealogy" in his  later texts was aetually a "belated attempt to provide a normative  justification for his theory," so that by 1983, Foucault had come to  see his own work as a continuation of the Enlightenment ethos he  had formerly repudiated. '^ In light, then, of the dangers of  totalizing political speech on the one hand and the perceived lack  of clarity in Foucault's 'project" on the other, I will now review  Foucault's relationshíp to the Enlightenment, broadly conceived. I  hope to confirm Christopher Norris' claim that Foucault came to  recognize that "his work made sense only from a critical  viewpoint informed by certain distinctively 'enlightenment' valúes  and presuppositions."'*  "For example, see Jana Sawicki, Disciplining Foucault (New York: Routledge,  1991); Judith Butler, Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversión of Identity (New  York: Routledge, 1990); Isaac Balbus, "Disciplining Women: Michel Foucault and  the Power of Feminist Discourse," Praxis International 5 (January, 1986): 466-83; and  Lois McNay, FoucauU and Feminism (Boston: Northeastern University Press, 1992).

Berlinische Monatsschrift; it was entitled "Was Ist  Aufklarung?" ("What Is Enlightenment?")." In that article, Kant  foeused on the notion of matxmty. BasicaUy, Kant argued that the  proeess which characterized the Enlightenment was one that  released humankind from immaturity, with immaturity defined as  "a certain state of our will that makes us aecept someone else's  authority to lead us in áreas where the use of reason is called for."^"  In the classical age, language sought to be as transparent as  possible, and knowledge, without being able to intégrate the  proeess of representation itself, was completely dependent upon  it.^' With Kant, the modern age began, and it was the gradual  breakdown of the Platonic identity equation between language and  world that inaugurated the age.^^ With the disruption of the  metaphysies of an objective coordinat ion of things and  representations, the notion of self-refleetion took over, and  suddenly "man" emerged as the controller of his own destiny  through language. As representation became opaque, "the analytic  of finitude," as Foucault defines it, began.^^ But the results  obtained from the analytic of human finitude are viewed quite  differently by Kant and Foucault.^*  For Kant, the recogrution of human finitude was in fact the  begirutíng of a new possibility for truly transcendent knowledge.

As Foucault points out, in Kant, "the limits of knowledge  provide a positíve foundatíon for the possibility of knowing."^^ For  Foucault, however, the notíon of a transcendental subject whose  transcendence is based upon finitude is symptomatíe of what he  calis "the anthropological sleep."^^ With the emerging recognitíon  of the limits of representatíon, which Foucault claims was the result  of late eighteenth-cenhary thought, the notíon of "man" as a unitary,  sovereign subject likevwse emerged. Subsequently, this construct of  "man" as the center of all things resulted in an anthropomorphic,  humanist, or subject-centered philosophy that failed to appreciate  fully the insight of humank ind ' s radically cont ingent and  historically deternüned situatíon.^^  Ultímately, then, Kant saw the recognitíon of human finitude as  an opporturúty for the discovery of a stable, transcendent human  nature, whereas Foucault saw the opportunity for reeognizing the  impossibility of tíanscendentals generally. For Foucault, there are  no tíanscendentals, only existentíals. Furthermore, Foucault clearly  wanted to distance himself from Kant's humanism, which he saw as  being impossibly intertwined with the modern ideology of the  infinite progressive power of ratíonality. According to Blair and  Cooper, "Foucault began with the assumptíon of neither a unitary,  sovereign subject in discourse ñor a totalizing social determinism.  He suspended both such possibilitíes and began his analysis with  the central focus of discourse, in order to build a theory of the  unique place of the subject in a diseursive event."^* As shown  below, the ubiquity of power in all communicatíve practices (contra  Habermas) in some form or another, along with humankind's  historieal finitude, precludes any total victory for fully conscious  rationality. Additionally, for Foucault, the idea of a single rational  ^The Order of Things, p. 317.  ^*lbid., p. 340. In effect, with the discovery of the limits of representation, the  notion of "man" emerged, and the resultant "subject-centered" philosophies failed  to take account of the best insights of the recognitíon of historicity.

Foucault  brackets out humanism (as the ideology of rationality) and the  notíon of the tíanscendent subject from the Kantian Enlightenment,  and offers in its place the notion of a "philosophical ethos," or a  "permanent critique of our historieal era."^^  Interestingly, Foucault refers to his "philosophical ethos" as a  "Umit attitude" and dissociates his own attitude about limits from  Kant's.^" Whereas Kant wanted to recognize the limits of  knowledge in order to give up on futile attempts at transgressing  them, Foucault's limit attitude seeks to recognize limits in all their  conventionality and arbitíariness in order to achieve the "possibility  of going beyond them."^' As Jon Simons points out, "Although  Foucault is highly critical of Kant's analytic of finitude, he learns an  important lesson from Kant's reflection on the conditions of  possibility of scientific knowledge. Human beings can be indebted  to constraints that are also enabling limits or conditions of  possibility. Rather than striving to transcend all limits, the critícal  questíon becomes which limits to knowledge and life should be  resisted or constructed."^^ According to Foucault, ". . criticism is  no longer going to be practíced in search for formal structures with  universal valué, but rather as a historieal investigation into the  events that have led us to constitute ourselves as subjects of what we  are doing, thinking, saying."•'•' And, in a move that parallels  Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics, while for Foucault there will  never be a point when we have "complete and definitíve knowledge  of what may constítute our historieal limits"^ or when we wdll ever  reach "mature adulthood," he nonetheless accedes that a critical  interrogatíon, a critícal ontology of ourselves, can be "meaningful."•^^  ^'Rabinow, The FoucauU Reader. p. 42.  30lbid., p. 45.  3'Ibid., pp. 45-50.  ^^FoucauU and the Political. p. 14.  •'•'Rabinow, The FoucauU Reader, p 46  3^lbid., p. 47,  35lbid., p. 49.  </page> <page sequence="10"> 176 RHETORICA  The relatívely vague and eonfusing marmer in which Foucault  artíeulated his view that "a critícal ontology of ourselves could be  meaningful" suggests the need for an additíonal comparison of the  Enlightenment thought of Habermas and Foucault. Given that  Foucault rejeets the (ratíonal) hvunanistíc and branscendental aspects  of Kant's Enlightenment "project," and yet states that we are to  recognize the limits of our finitude in order possibly to go beyond  them, it is imperatíve to come to terms v^th where that "beyond" is  in order to clarify Foucaulf s normative principies.^ Fvirthermore,  given the propensity of many contemporary scholars of rhetoric to  focus on consensual norms of communicative reason (and to  minimize or ignore the limits imposed by all "consensual"  procédures), such a clarification of poststructural norms is especially  needed.^^ On the one hand, as I shall endeavor to show, part of  Habermas ' problem with Foucault stems from the lat ter 's  "eryptonormativism," the seeming confusión of juridical and  disciplinary norms, and the rejection of "communicat ive  rationality."^ Nonetheless, these are primarily misunderstandings  that can be clarified through cióse analysis of Foucault's later  interviews. On the other hand, there is no resolving the différence  between Habermas' notíon of a power-free communicatíve situatíon  and Foucault's notíon of the ubiqmty of power in all conununicatíve  practíces. Ultímately, Habermas' critíque serves to illuminate several  aspects of the implicit normatíve framework in Foucault's texts.  First, Habermas correctly identif ies wha t he terms a  "cryptonormatívism" in Foucault's texts.^' Habermas, following  •'^ Again, at this point it might seem thoroughly at odds with Foucault's texts to  argüe that he has normative principies. Nonetheless, as the remainder of this  section hopes to show, the notion of critique itself appears inconceivable apart from  emancipatory interests.  '^For an excellent example, see Fraser, "Foucault on Modern Power," esp. pp.  272-87.  '*Even in his influential essay "The Subject and Power" (see Dreyfus and  Rabinow, Michel Foucault. pp. 208-26), Foucault only begins to differentiate between  productive power and domination, frequently using the term "power" to indícate  domination. This will h&gt;e diseussed more fully in section IV. For discussions of the  differences between the term "rational" and "reasonable," see C. Perelman and L.

Only with the introductíon of normatíve notíons of some  kind could Foucault begin to answer this questíon."*" Habermas  remarks that, despi te Foucault 's lack of overt, prescriptive  language, any discussion of "carceral" society implicitly critíques  it. Why discuss the limitíng aspects of conditions of possibility  unless there is the possibility to go beyond them? Second,  Habermas critiques Foucault's representation of human subjects as  mere exponents of impersonal diseursive forces who exhibit little,  if any, critical autonomy or creativity.*' For example, Habermas  argües that Foucault is too dismissive of the potential of juridical  norms to minimize or provide a corrective for unjust disciplinary  norms.*^ David Ingram summarizes Habermas' critique by stating  that "the normative reciprocity constitutive of a critical subject is  simply absent."*^  I contend that these assertions are both tíue and false. They  are true especially for Foucault's earlier period, when he was  struggling to bracket out human ageney in order to get at aspects  of diseursive formations that are beyond the direct control of the  will. They are false in the sense that, as was stated earlier, Foucault  recognized the validity of these critiques and, in fact, was working  towards elucidating his normative base when he died.** What is of  primary importance here is to recognize that Foucault's bracketing  of human ageney in his earlier texts does not lead to the inevitable  conclusión that Foucault denied human ageney. On the contrary,  as Foucault's work developed over time, it became increasingly  clear that the primary function of his versión of the analytic of  finitude was to provide a more mature means of thinking about the  •'^Haliermas, The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity, p. 284.

Furthermore, Foucault's "critical ontology of ourselves" is not  directed towards "normative reciprocity." As Annemiek Richters  indicates, it is Habermas who is interested in a so-ealled "discourse  ethics" based upon a "rational reconstruction of the universal  conditions for reason," whereas Foucault is interested in an "ethics  of transgression" based upon an analysis of how normalization  processes are connected with procedural rationality itself.*' That  is, Foucault is less interested in de te rmin ing the ra t ional  justification for norms than in de te rmin ing the dangers of  normalization and rational justification in general. In other words,  Foucault was more interested in the p rob lemat iza t ion of  normalization processes as a norm than in the articulation of  content-specific, ahistorieal norms.  Despite these differences, there are in fact many similarities  between Foucault and Habermas. First, both men eventually came  to regard power as a permanent feature of society.*^ Second, there  are many similari t ies between Habe rmas ' taxonomies and  Foucault's later interviews that distinguish between various levéis  of power.*^ Both men ultímately came not only to distinguish  power from domina t ion , but to affirm emancipa t ion from  domination as a goal of enlightenment. Finally, both Habermas  and Foucault aecept the notion that strategic inducements are  necessary for initiating and sustaining dialogue.** But this by no  means insures a happy unión between the two. Quite the contrary.  Just as Foucault found it necessary to sepárate himself from Kant's  transcendental humanism, he also found it necessary to sepárate  himself from what he considered to be Habermas' idealism.  As is weil known, Habermas is weil aware of the metaphysical  deficiencies of the Kantian tíanscendental subject, but nonetheless  believes that the emancipatory intentions of humanism can be  redeemed through communicative ratíonality.*' For Habermas  ••'"Modemity-Postmodernity Controversies: Habermas and Foucault," Theory.

Furthermore,  according to Habermas, this "readiness" implies "a commitment to  reach an impartíal consensus on disputed knowledge claims and  moral beliefs, a consensus that can be guaranteed only if each  interlocutor has equal opportunitíes to speak, free from extemal  and internal constraints... ."^^  For Foucault , a society free from external and internal  constraints is a utopian fictíon. Whereas Habermas argües for a  non-adversarial dialogue based on mutual respect in an "ideal  communicative situation," Foucault argües for a continuous  agonistic struggle against procédures of conduet governance that  refuse to be available to a critical, genealogical limit work—that is,  against the processes of overidentification (overidentification  referring to an attitude toward Self or Other of an individual who  refuses to engage in the problematization, or reflective analysis, of  that identity). As diseussed below, the ramifications of these  distinctions for rhetorical criticism are profound. As Ingram points  out, the expansión of communicative networks, of discourse  communities, neeessarily entails "the establishment of juridical  institutions whose emancipatory effects are highly ambiguous" in  the sense that, while they produce knowledge (and henee  pleasure), at the same time they "constíain and otherwise limit the  field of communicative interaction."^' Foucault states that  "[ejxchange and communicatíon are positíve forces at play within  complex but restrictíve systems; it is probable that they cannot  opérate independentíy of these."^^ Barbara Biesecker, following  Gayatri Spivak, clarifies this notion of the productive role of  relations of power by pointing out that the French word pouvoir  cannot simply be translated into the English word "power." In  fact, pouvoir also indicates "capacity" or a sense of "can-do"-ness.  According to Biesecker, "On this reading of Foucault, power ñames  not only the imposition of a limit that constrains human thought  '"Ingram, "Foucault and Habermas," p. 225, paraphrased from Habermas, The  Philosophical Discourse of Modernity. pp. 294-95.  5'lngram, "Foucault and Habermas," p. 227.  ^^The Archaeology of Knowledge. p. 225.  </page> <page sequence="14"> 180 RHETORICA  and action but a being-able that is made possible by a grid of  intelligibility."" In sum, power relations both empower and  constrain, so the task is not to "free" ourselves firom constraint, but  to illuminate constraints in order to transform them reflexively.  So while Habermas believes that Foucault underestimates the  emancipatory power of a critical subject who seeks the legitimation  of authority (which arguably is the telos oí Foucault's limit work),  Foucault argües that the ubiquity of power, especially in the form  of the limits imposed by the conditions of possibility in any given  diseursive situation, makes it impossible for the critical subject  fully to overeóme power's distorting effects in a fully rational way.  Yet power relations contain within themselves p roduc t ive  capacities. While the legitimacy of dominating forces has always  been at the heart of the Enl ightenment broadly conceived,  Habermas' aversión to reeognizing the articulation/constraint  equat ion keeps him from reeogniz ing that even the most  "legitimate" authority is enmeshed in both human finitude and the  dividing practices endemie to the processes of Identification, and  therefore can only be relatively, and temporarily, legitimate.^*  There is evidenee to suggest that Foucault's later thoughts  coneerning the subject as an active agent of power relations  aetually built upon Habermas' theory of corrununicative action in a  way that accounts for the i n su rmoun tab le historici ty of  communicative processes. In other words, Foucault's recognition  of the temporal dimensión of conditions of possibility that are  beyond the immediate reach of human will helpfully augments  Habermas' notion of a fully rational "ideal" speech situation. For  example , Ingram points out that Foucaul t ' s later turn to  hermeneutie genealogy showed how strategic action (power as  dominat ion) and communicat ive action (power as dialogic  empowerment) mutually condition one another, and how indeed  the former requires the latter. Furthermore, Foucault clearly  demonstra ted that there are no power-free communicat ive  ' '"Michel Foucault and the Question of Rhetoric," Philosophy and Rhetoric 25  (Winter, 1992): 356.

To summarize, then, Foucault distinguishes his own notion of  the Enlightenment "project" from both Kant and Habermas, and  the distinctions begin to bring into relief an implicit normative  framework. At the heart of this normat ive framework,  paradoxically, is a cali for the perpetual analysis of normalization  processes. Foucault rejeets the notion of the transcendental subject  who somehow can stand outside of history and calis instead for a  historically situated analysis of the limits that constrain ageney.  Thus, Foucault rejeets what he considers to be the idealistic,  utopian visión of a power-free communicative proeess: there is no  way that the human subject, enmeshed as s/he is in finitude, can  escape the d is tor t ing effects of power . However , these  qualifications do not result in a thoroughgoing rejection of social  critique. Far from it. What finally emerges is a normatively  grounded critical genealogy which, I shall argüe, is the basis for a  poststructural rhetorical critical praxis.  FOUCAULT'S AVOIDANCE OF EXPLICIT NORMATIVE STANDARDS  It is indeed paradoxical to claim that there are implicit norms in  the texts of a thinker who believed in an ethic of permanent  resistance to normalization.^* But Foucault was simply engaged in  ' 'Ingram, "Foucault and Habermas," pp. 236-37. See also Foucault, Discipline  and Puuish, pp. 26-27. While a complete discussion of Foucault 's notion of  genealogy is beyond the scope of this paper, Foucault defines the term as follows:  " . . genealogy . . . is a form of history which can account for the constitution of  knowledges, discourses, domains of objeets (formation of subject matters), etc.,  without having to make reference to a subject which is either transcendental in  relation to the field of events or runs in its empty sameness throughout the course  of history."

Whereas norms are  generally associated with constraints and conformity (e.g., the  processes of normalization), and more generally with the means by  which attitudes and behaviors are governed in social interaetíon, the  norms implicit in Foucault are "anti-norms" (in the sense that they  are associated with a permanent critique of normalizing and  subjeetifying processes) whose goal, according to Foucault, is to  determine "[how] the growth of capabilities can be disconnected  from the intensificatíon of power relations."^^ Nonetheless, because  Foucault's "norms" are difficult to ascertain, the relevanee of  Foucault's critical genealogy for rhetorical criticism generally has  gone unnoticed. Therefore, an explanation of the reasons for  Foucault's evasión of explicit normative standards will help to  clarify the relationshíp between critícal genealogy as linüt work and  its unrealized potentíal as a poststructural rhetorical critícal practice.  Foremost among the reasons for misunderstandings over  Foucault's normatíve framework is the nature of the trajectory of  his texts over the course of his lifetíme. The necessary bracketíng  of ageney in his earlier texts resulted in the general impression that  Foucault denied ageney altogether.^* Additíonally, he refuses (on  principie) to artículate explieitly the first principies that guide his  own critíque. But these are by no means meant to be critícisms of  Foucault. On the contrary, I believe that it was the very nature of  his project—to determine those aspects of human discourse which  both constítute the eonditíons of possibility for human subjeetívity  and créate linüts that are, in many ways, beyond human ageney—  which led to these ideatíonal occlusions.  In order to unders tand why Foucault 's terminology was  sometimes confused, one must understand that his work was  constantíy moving into new áreas and that he was never afraid to  rethink a positíon. In later interviews, Foucault argued that he had  investígated three genealogical domains: "a historieal ontology of  ourselves in relations to truth through which we constítute ourselves  as subjects . . . , [another] in which we constitute ourselves as  "Rabinow, The FoucauU Reader. p. 48.  '^For example, see Sawicki, Disciplining FoucauU. p. 103, and the discussion on  how many feminist researchers find in Foucault "a wholesale rejection of  subjeetívity and ageney."  </page> <page sequence="17"> Foucault, Limit Work, and Jeiuünger 183  subjects actíng on others . . . , [and a third] in which we constítute  ourselves as moral agents."^' According to Foucault, his various  texts foeused on different domains. Stíll, a constant preoccupation  for Foucault throughout almost all of his writíngs is his insistence  that subjeetívity is cor\strueted by diseursive forces that are largely  beyond human ageney. As Gary Gutting points out," . . . in the early  Foucault... there is no real attempt to avoid this bleakly detemünist  outlook."*" These early texts foeused primarily on the first  genealogical domain: the constructíon of knowledge by which we  constítute ourselves as subjects.  Later, in his middle period, Foucault began to focus on power  and knowledge differentials that initíally seemed to be more  amenable to the notior« of practical ageney and will, but in these  texts there was stíll a strong deterministíc flavor that fell primarily  into the second genealogical domain: how subjects act (rather  nündlessly) on one another. It was only in Foucault's very late  writíngs that the third genealogical domain began to be explored,  and only then did notíons of human ageney begin to take shape,  primarily in the form of his notion of eare for the self.*'  Unfortunately, due in part to Foucault's own earlier arguments, the  versión of ageney that emerged was seemingly reducible to  "anarchistíe struggles"*^ and a permanent critique that frequenüy  devolved into what seemed to be merely reactíve micropraetíces.*'  Stíll, it seems clear that Foucault became increasingly aware of his  own participation in the movement of humankind toward the  maturity of questíorüng illegitímate authoritíes, and the trajectory  of his texts led more and more to the notíon of linüt work as a  means for proactive human ageney.  Regardless, the notion of a proactive work on limits and a  normatíve basis for such a critique, for reasons other than the  trajectory of his scholarship, remains difficult to detect. For  example, Foucault's arguments do seem to preclude the possibility  "Rabinow, The FoucauU Reader. p. 351.  «"Norris, -What Is Enlightenmentr, p. 160.  *'See especially his later interviews, the second and third volumes to The  History of Sexuality, and various statements fo be found in The Final Foucatdt. ed.

[that would] consist of taking the forms of  resistance against different forms of power as a startíng po i n t . . . to  lócate their positíon, find out their point of applicatíon and their  methods used." Foucaul t called these forms of res is tance  "anarehistic s truggles," a term that seems to resonate wi th  normatíve relatívism.*^  While the ult ímate political efficaey (and usefulness for  rhetorical criticism) of Foucault's theories will be diseussed in  detall in the final section of this essay, some contemporary critical  theorists have argued against Foucault's strategy of resistance as  being purely reactive rather than proactive, incapable of actively  working for human emancipation.** Christopher Norris argües  that Foucault "found himself in the awkward position of one who  sought to maintain a strongly oppositíonal or counter-hegemonic  stance, yet whose outlook of extreme epistemological and ethical  skeptícism left him at the last with no ground on which to stand in  advaneing these dissident claims."*^ Later, in the same article,  Norris argües that the above-mentioned conundrum led to  Foucault 's recognition that his " truth valúes of enlightened  thought—of reason in its jointly epistemo-critical and ethico- politícal modes—[could] not be abandoned without at the same  tíme renouncing any claim to promote or artículate the interests of  justíce, autonomy, and human emancipatíon."**  But Foucault's later interviews reveal many clues as to why he  rarely engaged in explieitly blatant artículatíons of his "normatíve"  stance. First, Foucault associated politics with polemics and  par t i sanship , and felt that the violent closure of polemical  statement precluded dialogue.*^ Second, Foucault, as suggested  **Ingram, "Foucault and Habermas," p. 249.  ^'Dreyfus and Rabinow, Michel FoucauU, pp. 210-11.  **Jana Sawicki, "Foucault, Feminism and Questions of Identity," in Gutting,  The Cambridge Companion to Foucault, p. 294, is an example.

As far as  Foucault was concerned, there "was no external position of  certainty, no universal understanding . . . beyond history and  society."^° In other words, Foucault's hermeneutie genealogy  recognized that a critical practice that seeks to analyze limits, but  considers itself absolutely free of limits, remains ensnared in a  naive idealism. That is, a critical praxis that seeks to reflect on  limits in no way is meant to presuppose that critics themselves are  not also constrained by various diseursive and nondiscursive  forces. Furthermore, for Foucault, criticism is not a matter of  simply subst i tu t ing new subjectívities for oíd ones, but of  d isplacement rather than replacement , a mat ter of  problematization, not position taking.^' To take a strong positíon  would simply be to replace an oíd overidentífication with a new  one, whereas to analyze limits is to questíon positíons themselves,  to problematize and displace them, and to work perpetually at  tíansforming them.  This conviction to problematize perpetually and displace  "strong" positions led one commentator, Paul Rabinow, to assert  that "our task is to cast aside . . . utopian schemes, the search for first  principies, and to ask instead how power aetually operates in our  society."^^ But is not such a statement its own first principie?  Whether we can simply do away with metaphysies is stíll very much  in question, and the equation of first principies with utopian  schemes is an oversimplificatíon. For example, is it not clear that for  Foucault conceptual unities are neeessarily dangerous and yet  necessary as the eonditíons of possibility for knowledge?^^ Is it not  equally clear that there are specific relatíonships between power and  knowledge, sometímes in negatíve and sometímes in positíve forms,  that can be revealed through an analysis of discourse and practíces?

Foucault's concern with the violence of position-taking, the  bracketing of ageney in his early texts, his early formulations of  limit work as "anarehistic struggles" that were fundamentally  reactive, his aversión to normal iza t ion processes , and his  reluctance to state his own "first principies" explieitly have all  contíibuted to considerable confusión. But regardless of Foucault's  delibérate evasión of explicit normative justifications for his critical  genealogy, one could say that he enacted his first principies  through his various texts. Additionally, his work resulted in a  fairly successful effort to develop a new approach to the study of  discourse, and henee of human subjeetívity, through the bracketíng  out of ageney in order to arrive at the otherwise transparent  eonditíons of possibility that only the distancing effects of a certain  brand of discourse analysis (archaeology/genealogy) could  achieve. Additíonally, by the tíme Foucault turned to the third  genealogical domain of ethics (and more impor t an t ly for  traditional rhetorical critics, human ageney in general), he had  come to recognize that limiting critique to local "anarehistic"  micropractices alone might result in a failure to recognize the more  generalizable aspects of illegitimate authority. He recognized, in  other words, that limiting critique to partial and local inquiries  alone might allow us to be determined by more general structures,  which, if not addressed through proactive limit work, might  continué to determine our conditions of possibility.'^*  Despite Foucault's efforts to move beyond what he termed  "commentary," or "the re-apprehension through the manifest  meaning of any discourse of another meaning at once secondary  and primary, that is, more hidden but also more fundamental,"  this is clearly the very proeess he engaged in with his critical  genealogy.^^ For Foucault's genealogical analyses led him to the  notion of dechiffrement ("deciphering"), which "amounts to an  understanding of social practices as having an intelligibility  radically different from that available to the actors who, according  to the hermeneut ie account, find the pract ices [variously]  '^•'Rabinow, The FoucauU Reader, p. 47.  ^'Dreyfus and Rabinow, Michel FoucauU. p. xxiii; see also Godzich, The Culture  of Literacy, pp. 152-53.  </page> <page sequence="21"> Foucault, Limit Work, and Jenrünger 187  meaningful."^* Ultimately, Foucault's critical genealogv is  designed for the analysis of limits on human subjeetívity that  othervñse go uimotíced, yet it recognizes the impossibility of  transcendent, ahistorieal, content-specific norms (since critics  themselves are enmeshed in human finitude). While there are a  number of reasons for Foucault's not explieitly pointing out the  normatíve basis of his crítíeal enterprise, his "positíonless" positíon  is reminiscent of the femiliar adage in communicatíon studies that  "one cannot not communicate." The refusal lo commimicate, of  course, commurtícates the very refusal. So it is with Foucault's  critícal genealogy. While Foucault argües for a perpetual critíque  of processes of normalization, that in itself is a norm, and a norm of  considerable import for a poststructural rhetorical critícal practíce.  FOUCAULT'S NORMATIVE FRAMEWORK AS POSTSTRUCTURAL  RHETORICAL CnmcAL PRAXIS: JENNINGER'S KRISTALLNACHT  ADDRESS  Any theoretically sound, poststructural critical rhetoric needs  to be coneerned with the health of commimitíes, the interests of  justice, autonomy, and human emancipatíon in an age when  sophistíc insights into the paradoxes of language have resurfaced  arKi the dangers of artíeulatíon are more pronounced than ever.^  On the one hímd, notíons of legitimacy can no longer be isolated to  the local conunurüty (for what should happen when communitíes  collide?); and yet, on the other hand, concems for the "tyrarmy" of  globally enforced prescriptive and proscriptive normative  standards immune from self-reflexive analysis are well founded.  The question that remains is how to ascertain the uniquely  Foucauldian norms implied by his distínct notíon of enlightened  maturity and their impUcatíons for rhetorical critídsm.

In the end, 1  argüe that such limit work provides a necessary and valuable  corrective to the Habermasian norms that currently domínate  many rhetorical critics ' not ions of civic responsibi l i ty ,  communication ethics, and discourse ethics.  The preceding analysis has, I hope, clarified the various  reasons why Foucauldian norms are so difficult to specify.  Foremost among those reasons is the simple fact that Foucault's  principal norm is the requirement that critics engage in a perpetual  crit ique of normalizat ion processes. It would have been a  performative contradiction, not to mention antithetical to a  sophisticated hermeneutie genealogy, to state content-specific,  ahistorieal prescriptive or proscriptíve norms explieitly. Therefore  the normatíve framework in Foucault's texts concerns itself with a  form of critícal procedure, not with a list of utopian principies by  which interlocutors "must" or "should" abide.  In its most "mature" form, Foucault's normatíve framework  for critical practice takes the form of a "limit a t t i tude" that  constítutes "an ethic of permanent resistance, in which constant  activism is required in order to prevent enabling limits from  congealing into constraining limitations. "^* Such an attitude  toward the limits that constitute the conditions of possibility  within a given diseursive formation, an attitude frequently referred  to as an "ethics of transgression," stands in stark contrast to a  Habermasian "discourse ethics." Following Richters' analysis,  Habermas' discourse ethics assumes that norms are "susceptible to  rational justification" and that the ideal speech situation "can be  considered a 'metanorm' . . . a condition for argumentation free of  domination."^^ But such a "metanorm" ignores the necessity of  dividing practices which provide discourse communities with their  unique capacities. On the other hand, Foucault 's "ethics of  transgression" is not designed to oppose limits or neutralize  differences, but to illuminate limits in order to make subjects aware  of the nature of differences so as to subject those limits to reflexive  analysis. Basically, Foucault's "metanormative framework" might  be read as follows: Human capacities are enabled by dividing  ^*Simons, Foucault and Ihe Political, p. 22  '^'Richters, "Modernity-Postmodernity Controversies," pp. 624-26.  </page> <page sequence="23"> Foucault, Limit Work, and Jeruiinger 189  practices that constitute limits for the conditions of possibility  within any given field of knowledge, but, for the most part, those  linüts are transparent and unavailable for critical reflection (since  problematization tends to be antíthetícal to actíon). Therefore, it is  impor tan t to engage in a perpe tua l critical hermeneut ie  genealogical practice that seeks to reveal these limits, not to  overeóme them (which is impossible), so that new modes of  subjeetívity can be promoted. Herein lies a proactíve linüt work  that can serve as a mature questíorüng of authority. At all costs,  ossified positíon-taking must be avoided due to the fact that we, as  critícs, are also enmeshed in human finitude. Furthermore, we, as  critíes, do not want to be engaged in processes of overidentíficatíon  and normalization so much as in the critical analysis of the  necessary limits involved in identifieation and normalization  processes. According to Foucault,  Le travail d'un intellectuel n'est pas de modeler la volonté politique  des autres; il est, par les analyses qu'il fait dans les domaines qui sont  les siens, de réinlerroger les évidences et les postuláis, de sécouer les  habitudes, les manieres de faire et de penser, de dissiper les  familiarités admises, de reprendre la mesure des regles et des  institutions et, á partir de cette reproblématisation (oü il joue son  métier spécifique d'intellectuel), de particijjer á la formation d'une  volonté politique (oü il a son role de citoyen á jouer).^  (The work of an intellectual is not to shape the political will of others;  it is through the analyses he does in his own domains, to reinterrogate  the obvious facts and jx)stulates, to shake customs, ways of doing and  thinking, to dissipate admitted familiarities, to re-examine rules and  institutions and, from this reproblematization [where he plies his  specific trade of intellectualism] to particípate in the formation of the  public will [where he has his role of citizen to play].)*'  Foucault stated that he wanted to produce some of the effects of  truth in order for a possible battle to be fought by orgarüzatíons yet  to be defined. Rhetorical critics are in a unique position to  imdertake that sbiiggle through the development of a poststructural  rhetorical critical praxis that focuses not only on "normative  ^Le soud de la vérité," Magazine littéraire 207 (Mai, 1984): 18-23.  *'Translation by Professor Barbara Wamick.  </page> <page sequence="24"> 190 RHETORICA  reciprocity" but on a "critícal ontology of ourselves" as well. But  what would such a critícal praxis look like? Such a practíce must  undoubtedly focus on dividing practíces themselves, a task to which  Foucault's "archaeological" analysis of diseursive formatíons is well  suited.*^ While a complete explicatíon of Foucault's archaeology is  beyond the scope of this essay, what follows is a brief introductíon  to the salient aspects of a poststructural rhetorical critícal practíce  designed to analyze Urrüts.*^  Limits are best revealed through the analysis of what cannot be  said, or what does not count as true or valuable in a given situatíon.  Therefore an excellent site for the exploratíon of limits is in speech  that fails dramatícally. In contradistínctíon to the "touehstone" or  "masterpiece" perspectíve of traditíonal rhetorical critícs, which  holds that rhetorical principies are best discovered in "great  speeches," the analysis of limits is best accomplished in situatíons  where critícs can isolate dramatíe, negatíve responses to discourse.  The task, then, is to analyze patterns of negatíve responses in order  to determine an outline of dividing practices relevant to particular  kinds of situatíons. Such an analysis, from another perspectíve,  could also analyze, according to Foucault's archaeological method,  the discourse that deterirünes what does in fact count as true wathin  a given diseursive community. That is, what counts as a pertínent  object of study? Who is qualified to speak and by what means?  What are the relevant concepts that must be mastered by those  authorized to speak? And what are the means of strategieally  negotíatíng between members within a diseursive community and  between communitíes? Such negatíve and positíve limit analyses  would reveal, at least in part, the normalizatíon processes at work  within any given diseursive community or "generic" situation in  order to allow for a historically situated analysis of the conditions of  ^^bviously a full treatment of this subject would carry us beyond the limits of  the present inquiry; see Foucault's Archaeology of Knowledge.

An example will help to clarify the productive valué of a  critical practice based upon limit work. By comparing Thomas  Farrell's rhetorical analysis of a speech given by Philipp  Jenninger commemorating the fiftieth "anrüversary" of the anti- Jewish pogrom known as the Kristallnacht with my own analysis  of the speech following Foucauldian norms, the benefits of a  Foucauldian critique can be revealed.** My point, of course, is  not to discredit Farrell's interesting analysis, but to indícate how  his dismissal of poststructuralism leads to a critical analysis that  fails to account for aspects of the address that can only be  captured through limit work.*^  On the morrüng of November 10,1988, in the Plenary Room of  the Germán Bundestag, President Philipp Jenninger gave his  commemorative address to the Germán parliament and visiting  dignitaries. In that speech Jeiuünger attempted to explain why the  Germán people were originally drawn toward National Socialism  and stressed the need for the Germán people to face up to their  Nazi past.** While the speech seems to characterize fairly the  relationshíp between the Germán people and Adolph Hitler,  partieulariy at the time of Hitler's most dramatic political  suecesses, reaction to the speech was universally négative.  **Farreirs analysis of the Jeiminger speech can be found in his book Norms of  Rhetorical Culture, pp. 308-21.

Their analysis of diseursive  practices in the field of speech communication fulfills the requirements of a  poststructural rhetorical critical practice by analyzing normalizing diseursive,  transgressing limits in order to reveal them, and utilizing findings in order  proactively to promote new forms of subjeetívity within the field.  **For an extended discussion of the audience and occasion, see Girnth,  Europaische Hochschulschriften, pp. 2-4.  </page> <page sequence="26"> 192 R H E T O R I C A  Aeeused of tactlessness and lack of historieal understanding, if not  outright sympathy with Hitier himself, Jenninger was foreed to  resign his office the following day, leading many to the renewed  realization that aspects of Germany's Nazi past still could not be  publicly diseussed.*^ Farrell's Aristotelian/Habermasian analysis  concludes that Jenninger ' s speech was "monumen ta l l y  inappropr ia te , " yet was " invent ional" in the sense that it  "prompt[ed] us to rethink the generational bounds of moral  responsibility."** A Foucauldian analysis would lead in another  direction. Rather than simply labeling the speech itself as  inappropr ia te , the eritic would be led to specula te about  characteristics of the audience that rendered it incapable of  contemplating the ideas conveyed by Jenninger.  While space does not permit a complete translation of the text,  suffice it to say that the speech, while oftentimes brutal (e.g.,  offering detailed accounts of Nazi atrocities) and frequently  coming across more as a history lesson than a commemorative  address, in no way appears to be deliberately misleading or  intended to justify Hitler. True to his introduction, Jenninger  attempted to explain both the events that led to Germany 's  National Socialist era as well as Jewish persecution in order to  purge Germany of its collective, and perhaps debilitating, guilt.  Toward the end of the speech Jenninger declared, "Meine Damen  und Herrén, die Erinnerung wachzuhalten und die Vergangenheit  als Teil unserer Identitát als Deutsche anzunehmen—dies allein  verheifit uns Álterin wde den Jüngeren Befreiung von der Last der  Geschichte." ("Ladies and Gentlemen, keeping our memory alive  and accepting the past as a part of our Germán identity—this alone  promises both the older generat ion as well as the younger  generation liberation from the burden of history.") But reactions to  the speech indícate that Jenninger's cali to "aecept the past" was, at  least in this situation, itself unacceptable. Only minutes into the  address members of the audience began heckling Jenninger, and  *''For two articles that concisely summarize the relationshíp between politics  and history in Germany, see Stephen Brockmann, "The Politics of Germán History,"  History and Theory 29 (1990): 179-89; and Theodore S.

Given the fact that Jenninger's address, while perhaps not  artful, seems to be a fairly straightforward account of Germán  history during the Nazi era, why were responses so négative?  According to Farrell's account, the speech failed because " . . . these  events, in their very enormity, are too cióse to their audience to  permit space for reflection. ." Furthermore, Farrell argües that  Jenninger engaged in an inappropriate, irorüc style: "My concern  is that [Jenninger's speech] may have abandoned a more direct,  reflective address prematurely, without ever having given it a fair  chance. In Jenninger's discourse, and probably without his intent,  the members of his Germán audience ha[d] been made characters  in a performative symbolic act, rather than witnesses to, and  judges of, their own role in history." Here we see the way in which  Farrell's norms color his criticism, especially with the dual foci of  intention and judgment. Farrell's argument is that rhetoric is  ethical and audiences are rational. He states that "the movement  of rhetoric is from a practical capacity to a techne with ethical  significance to a theoretically comprehended practice capable of  producing collaborative 'goods' for a responsible civic life." By  reducing public influence to a "practical capaci ty" and a  "comprehended practice," Farrell limits rhetorical criticism to an  analysis of the ways in which centered subjects intentionally use  rhetoric towards ethical ends. Such a normative framework makes  the general truthfulness of Jeniünger's speech, eoupled with the  uniformly négative responses to it, difficult to explain exeept in  terms of lack of art on the part of the speaker in failing to recognize  the requirements of the occasion (broadly conceived), and the  failure of Jenninger to give an even "more direct" style a "fair  chance" to allow the audience to judge for themselves. While  Farrell himself recognizes that the speech was fundamentally  straightforward and truthful, as well as the fact that the speech  "was too cióse to the audience" to allow space for reflection, his  normative framework does not provide sufficient means for  ^'Girnth, Europaische Hochschulschriften, p. 4.  </page> <page sequence="28"> 194 RHETORICA  exploring the extra-intentional reasons for the failure.^"  The norms and procédures related to a pos t s t ruc tu ra l  rhetorical critical practice would suggest that this speech is a  frvdtful site for the analysis of limits because of the strong négative  reactions provoked by it. Furthermore, rather than seeking to  understand what the speaker "did wrong," such an analysis would  seek to understand how Germán overidentifications are revealed  by the négative reactions to the speech. Ideally, the eritic would  interview the members of parliament who walked out during the  speech and analyze négative reports of the speech in Germán  newspapers, looking for patterns of responses that do not seem to  correspond to the content of the speech itself. In this case, for  example, Beriin Free Democratic Party (FDP) deputy Wolfgang  Leuder said that Jenninger had "laid the foundation for a false  understanding of history by the Germans."^' The Kijlner Stadt- Anzeiger reported that "Jenninger tried to deliver a lesson in  Germán history between 1933 and 1945 in a misleading and  inadequate manner. It could even give rise to the impression that  he had tried to explain and excuse Hitler and show understanding  for many Germans' négative attitude toward the Jews."^^ FDP  Chairman Otto Graf Lambsdorff said that "over long passages,  Jenninger gave the impression that he was trying to justify, or  partly justify, the worst events in Germán history."^^ Even in this  brief sample, patterns emerge: Jenninger intended to mislead the  Germán people and justify or excuse Hitler. But clearly, at least for  many non-Germans reading the speech, this was not the case.  Jenninger may have been relatively artless in the way in which he  a t tempted to explain Germany ' s fascination and general  satisfaction with Hitler, but the accounts provided in the speech  were in no way a justification for Hifler or National Socialism, ñor  was Jenninger's historieal narrative misleading.

Arguably, an  apology to the Jewish community statíng that the Germán people  were themselves "misled" or "tricked" by Hitler would have been  considered "true."'^ Furthermore, Jenninger, as President, was  granted the status of apologist, but not the status of judge or  psychotherapist.

In many ways, such a conclusión resonates with  Farrell's notion of the inventional capacity of the "failure" of  rhetoric. It is not so much that Farrell and Habermas are in  disagreement with Foucault in matters related to the health of  communities; it is rather a matter of coming to terms with the  variety of ways in which rhetoric truly irüluenees the formation of  personal and social identity. There is little doubt that rhetors can  adapt artfully to rhetorical situations and that audiences, given the  chance, can frequently make wise and just decisions. But it is also  the case that rhetors and audiences are neeessarily entangled in  limits that frequently go unreeogiüzed.  A poststíuctural rhetorical criticism complements traditional  forms of critique by seeking to reveal the processes of  normalization and identity construction within diseursive  communities, to illuminate otherwise transparent limits by  analyzing négative responses to speech and action, and to discover  what counts as "truth" in any given situation. It furthermore seeks  to utilize those findings proactively to créate new forms of  subjectivity that are less violent and more productive. Rhetoricians  should realize that the construction of identity is not neeessarily, or  even predominantly, rational and is violent to the extent that it  exeludes différence. Valorizing différence at all costs undermines  the very possibility of truth, freedom, and community, while  overfocusing on intentional centered subjects and rational  audiences underestimates the importance (and inevitability) of  limits in the construction of identities. Therefore, rhetorical critics  should combine limit work in a fruitful way with traditional  approaehes in order to engage in a practíce that avoids both the  utopian expectatíon of power-free communication and various  forms of postmodern relativism which fail to recognize the  necessity of identítíes for the proeess of communicatíon.^*  '*For helpful comments at various points in the development of Ihe essay, I  would like to thank Barbara Wamick, Ernst Behler, John Stewart, and the editor and  anonymous reviewers of Rhetorica.  </page> </plain_text>
