WILLETT The University of Chicago INTRODUCTORY The Book of Genesis is the record of Hebrew ancestral traditions. It gives some account of the patriarchs, the men who were regarded as the progenitors of the nation, and prefaces this recital with the Hebrew stories of primitive times. It thus forms an introduction to the authentic history of Israel, beginning with the occupation of Canaan. It falls naturally into two sections-the stories of origins (chaps. I-II) and the stories of the patriarchs (chaps. I2-50). The Hebrews were no exception to the rule that early nations, for the most part, possessed some traditions of the past purporting to describe the origin of the world and the beginnings of human life. The earliest questions with which childhood is concerned are those relating to its environment and the phenomena of nature. Simi- larly, the child-races sought explanation of the beginnings of the world and human affairs, and the traditions which took form under this impulse became the accepted cosmogonies of later generations. Among the stories of creation and primitive times preserved by the various nations,' those of the Babylonians show a marked resemblance to the Hebrew narra- tives.2 Their chief difference lies in the elaborate polytheism of the former, as contrasted with the simple and lofty monotheism of the latter. That the form of the stories among the two peoples is so similar as to prove close relationship is not doubted by any who examine them. But the biblical accounts are marked by a dignity and moral earnestness wholly lacking in the other stories. That the Babylonian tradition is the older of the two appears evident, both from the antiquity of that civilization I Lenormant, The Beginnings of History. 2 Records of the Past, New Series, Vol. I, pp. i22f.; Lenormant, op. cit; Kent, Narratives of the Beginnings of Hebrew History, Appendices III-V; Driver, Genesis, pp. 26-30; Dillmann, Genesis, Vol. I, pp. 33 f.; Kirkpatrick, The Divine Library of the Old Testament, pp. 47 f.; Gunkel, Schopfung und Chaos, pp. i6 f.; G.

The evidence favors the view that Hebrew prophetism took the accounts of early times, either brought from Babylonia at the period of the migration or found on Canaanite soil as the result of eastern influence in the land, and, having purified them of their polytheism, employed them as vehicles of religious instruction. Clearly, little could be done by the spiritual teachers of Israel to impress the oneness, universality, and ethical perfection of Jeho- vah so long as the narratives of primitive times, so fascinating to an imagi- native people, were being rehearsed in every household in their poly- theistic form. The need of the hour was a cosmogony fitted to accompany the moral and spiritual messages of the men of God. That these narratives are historical it is neither possible nor necessary to affirm. The early belief that they were authentic records of creation and the early life of the race has yielded gradually to a more just con- ception of their character and purpose as scientific evidence has accumu- lated. The fact that we have not merely one account of creation, but two (Gen. I:I-2:4a and 2:4b-25), and that they are differentiated by such features as the two divine names, wholly contrasted orders of events in the creative process, and a totally different conception of the nature of Deity and his relation to creation, reveals the fact that our record in Gene- sis is composite, the union of at least two strands of tradition not easily reconcilable with each other. Further, the attempt to harmonize the first account of creation with the facts of geology and astronomy, once regarded as not only possible but convincing, has lost its apologetic value as the phe- nomena of nature are better understood; while no successful attempt has ever been made to harmonize the second account with the facts of science. The same results follow the close study of the remaining narratives in Gen., chaps. I-Ii. The value of the Hebrew stories of primitive times lies, not in their historical authenticity and scientific exactness, but in the service which they rendered to the religious life of an age easily seduced to the lower levels of polytheism and superstition. The exalted truths concerning God and humanity of which these traditions became the vehicle formed under prophetic ministry a part of that unique asset which is the glory of the Hebrew race. Facing such pictures of the origin of human life, it was impossible to escape their elevating influence as compared with other race traditions. Their value lay, not in the facts they purported to give, but in the truths they taught. 46</page><page sequence="3">EXPOSITORY STUDIES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 47 GOD THE CREATOR: GEN. I: 1-253 I. CRITICAL QUESTIONS The narrative of creation in I: -12: 4a is followed in our record by another, of strikingly different nature, in 2 :4b-25.4 The first is taken from the source known as the late priestly account, usually designated P. The second belongs to the early Judean prophetic source, J. The former is marked by a precise and formal order of events, with recurring formulae, such as, "And God said," "And it was so," "And God saw that it was good," "And there was evening and there was morning," in constant con- trast with the free and flowing narrative of the second story. In the first account there is a somewhat logical order of progress in the creation: light, expanse, land, vegetation, luminaries, swarmers of the waters, birds, ani- mals, man; in the second the order is very different and far less natural, viz.: man, Eden, trees, beasts, birds, woman. Again the conception of Deity in the first story is reserved and majestic; in the second, anthropo- morphic and intimate; while the divine names are Elohim ("God") and Jehovah ("Lord"), respectively. The similarity of the biblical creation stories to those preserved in Babylonian records has been mentioned. Of these the creation epic, recorded on seven tablets discovered in I875 by George Smith in the remains of the library of Ashurbanipal, is the most complete, and that portion of it which recounts the creation by Marduk bears unmistakable marks of relationship to our first story, while the Sumero-Babylonian story more closely resembles the second biblical account. The difficulties involved in the supposition that Gen. T:I-2:4a is a literal and correct representation of the events of creation disappear when its source, pictorial character, and purely religious purpose are considered. Those difficulties--such as the recent date assumed for creation as con- trasted with the known antiquity of human and animal life; the impossi- bility of reconciling the order of events in the creative process with the facts known to science; the appearance of light on the first day, while the heavenly bodies were not created till the fourth; and the provision of vegetable food alone, whereas flesh-eating animals existed long previous to man-appear only so long as the narratives are made to bear the burden of scientific accuracy. When, however, their true character is perceived, the task of the reconciler of Genesis and geology is deprived of significance and value at the same moment that it is discovered to be impossible. 3 International Sunday-School Lesson for January 6, I9o6. 4 Driver, Introduction to the Literature of the Old Testament, 6th ed., pp. 5 f.; Car- penter, The Oxford Hexateuch, Vol. I, pp. 76 f.</page><page sequence="4">THE BIBLICAL WORLD II. EXPOSITION The creation story of Gen. I:I -2:4a divides the process into seven stages, culminating in the sabbath of rest. To one living under a law which strongly emphasized the observance of the seventh day as a sabbath, creation would naturally fall into the framework of a weekof creative power, ending with the sacred day of rest. To each day of this week a given section of the entire process is assigned, and the climax is reached in the sabbath, which for this reason, according to the prophetic version of the decalogue (Ex. 20:8-II), became the day of rest and worship. The first two verses present the conditions previous to the first creative act, which is recorded in vs. 3. The whole might be rendered: "In the beginning, when God created .... the earth being waste, etc.,.... then God said." In the Babylonian story the creation of the world by Marduk was preceded by the conquest of Tiamat ("chaos"). Over the formless void the divine spirit brooded with the promise of coming life. With vs. 3 the regular recurring words of introduction, progress, and completion of each day's work first appear. "Let there be" is the potent word which brings the successive features of the universe into being; "And God saw that it was good" marks the perfection of each step; "And the evening," etc., gives the formal note of conclusion. The days are not to be understood as indefinite periods of geologic time, but in the ordinary sense familiar to the writer and his readers. The parallelism of the two groups of days, I-3 and 4-6, has often been pointed out. On the first day the light is created, and on the fourth the light-bearers are formed; on the second day the expanse of firmament, the bowl-shaped solid vault which covers the earth, is made to divide the upper waters (of heaven) from the lower, and on the fifth the creatures of the waters and of the sky are created; on the third day the dry land is collected and vegetation appears, and on the sixth the creatures of the earth are brought into being and man is formed. III. SERMON OUTLINE Over against the polytheistic and grotesque beliefs of other races regarding the beginnings of the world, our narrative embodies the sublime truth that whenever this event occurred, however long it may have conti- tinued and by whatever method it may have been accomplished, it was God who was the Creator. Over against the materialistic theories of our own day, with their denial of divine being or activity, the same great truth needs insistent emphasis: God was the Creator. 48</page><page sequence="5">EXPOSITORY STUDIES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 49 To the books of science we go to learn the method of creation; to the inspired narrative we must go to learn the cause behind all method. If the slow processes of the evolutionary explanation of creation are the ones to which science leads the student, he does not thereby exclude God from the process. He merely learns that evolution is the divine way of working. The familiar words of Cardinal Baronius are worthy of remembrance: "The Bible is not given to teach how the heavens go, but how to go to heaven. MAN MADE IN THE IMAGE OF GOD: GEN. 1:26-2:35 I. CRITICAL QUESTIONS The words, "These are the generations of the heavens and the earth, when they were created" (Gen. 2:4a) constitute the formula employed by the priestly writer to introduce (or as here to close) one of the sections into which his work is divided. They properly belong to the narrative of I:I-2:4a, and are used in nine other cases in the book of Genesis by the same writer. The two narratives of creation (Gen. I: 1-2:4a and 2:4b-25) present divergent accounts of the creation of man. In the first he is the climax of the creative process; in the second he is the first to appear. In the first man and woman are created together; in the second the woman is formed only after the man discovers that among all the beasts of the earth there is not a help meet for him. In the first the creation of man is an act of the divine word; in the second, of active manipulation. In the first account the majesty and power of God are prominent; in the second the anthro- pomorphisln is bold and impressive. II. EXPOSITION The plural used in the expression, "Let us make man," does not imply conference with angels, still less any doctrine of the Trinity. It denotes the impressiveness and solemnity of a creative act which brought the entire process to its culmination, and resulted in the bestowment of the possibilities of likeness to God upon man. It is appropriate that before this final act of creation God should speak of its importance. The earth requires the master-hand of man to bring forth the noblest results, and to repress the tendencies to decay and ruin. Animals also need his humane and kindly lordship over them. For the revealing of the "sons of God," men through whom the divine purpose can be realized, the whole creation groans and travails in pain (Rom. 8:19-22). s International Sunday-School Lesson for January 13, 1907.</page><page sequence="6">THE BIBLICAL WORLD Our writer conceives the earliest estate of man and the beasts as one of friendly intimacy and kindness. No life was taken for food. Fruits and herbs were sufficient. The host of heaven and earth includes all the individual features of the creative process. The later sections of the Hebrew law laid strong emphasis upon the keeping of the sabbath. Few crimes were regarded as more reprehensible than deliberate violations of the sabbath rules. It is the teaching of Ezekiel that because of neglected sabbaths the punishment of exile fell upon the people (Ezek., chap. 20). The author here naturally emphasizes the importance of the day. God selected it, he insists, from all the days as sacred to rest. Therefore man also should rest on the seventh day (Ex. 20:8-11). III. SERMON OUTLINE Man's likeness to God is potential rather than actual. He was created with possibilities undeveloped, but immeasurable in importance. Our record affirms that God created man in his own image. It would be even truer to say with Jesus that God is making man in his image. The process is slow but certain wherever the co-operation of the human will can be secured. The mastery of regenerate humanity over the earth and all its creatures is the dream whose realization prophets and apostles hailed. The Hebrews sought the sanction of their sabbath by insisting that God rested on that day from all his work, and that out of kindness to one's servant he should allow him rest on the sabbath day, in remembrance of his own bondage in Egypt (Deut. 5:12-I6). The Christian, recog- nizing the unwritten law that there must be a day of rest, selects the Lord's Day, not by divine command, but through the impulse of gratitude and reverence. The sabbath was a day of rest; the Lord's Day is more-a time of spiritual culture. The one was based on the law of an earthly commandment; the other, on the power of an unbroken life. The one was for the Hebrew race in the probationary state of its history; the other is for every age and all mankind. MAN'S SIN AND GOD'S PROMISE: GEN. 3 : -6, 14, i56 I. CRITICAL QUESTIONS This narrative is a portion of the section 2:4b-3:24, which contains the second account of creation and the story of the first sin. It belongs to the Judean prophetic document, usually known as J. 6 International Sunday-School Lesson for January 20, I907. 50</page><page sequence="7">EXPOSITORY STUDIES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT The picture presented is to be understood less as a record of primitive events of human experience than as the attempt to account for moral conditions as they existed in the writer's day, and as they have ever existed. The scene is the garden in Eden (2:8; 3:23), which was apparently an ideal rather than a known region; for while two of its rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates (2:14), are easily located, the other two correspond to nothing in the geography of the Orient. The writer's location of the primitive home of man is in the East, but his standpoint is Palestine, not Babylonia (e. g., the fig tree [3:7] native to Syria, but not found in Babylonia). While the sources of this story of the first sin are not so clearly traceable as those of the creation narratives, its relations with Babylonian ideas are discernible. In that region the garden lay. On a Babylonian cylinder in the British Museum there is represented a fruit tree, with two figures seated near, stretching out their hands toward it, while a serpent coils behind one of them. The connection of this scene with the Hebrew narrative of the first sin appears probable. The serpent of the story is not the Satan of the later portions of the Old Testament (Job I:6; Zech. 3:i; I Chron. 2I:I); still less of the New. It is one of the creatures of the earth, though more subtle and clever-literally "smooth," "naked"-than the rest. It serves the pur- pose of representing evil suggestion as coming from without, while recoil- ing from the thought that it emanates from God, and unprepared as yet to accept the explanation of satanic agency which developed on Jewish soil under the growing influence of dualism. II. EXPOSITION The doctrine of the fall of man, with its insistence upon a primitive state of intellectual and moral excellence, is Miltonic rather than bib- lical. The Bible and the study of the moral life reveal the fact that char- acter is the result of growth under spiritual laws and leadership, from crudeness and inexperience, through the discipline of temptation and conflict with evil, to wisdom and virtue. The serpent has always been invested with unusual powers by super- stitious races. By such it is believed to possess a mysterious and uncanny sort of cunning and subtlety enjoyed by no other creature. The conversation between the woman and the serpent is supposed to have begun earlier. The first words here recorded mark the beginnings of the temptation. Nothing could be truer to human experience than this representation of temptation and its effect upon the will untrained to 5I</page><page sequence="8">THE BIBLICAL WORLD resistance. Temptation is the appeal which positive evil or the lesser good makes to the human soul. Sin is the consent of the will to the allure- ment thus presented. Virtue is the rejection of the evil and the deliberate choice of the good. The threat of death may well represent the writer's view that sin was the cause of mortality. If enlarged to the conception of moral degen- eration and death when persisted in, this statement is profoundly true. Physical death was of course present in the world long before the appear- ance of man. The curse pronounced upon the serpent is not only the vindication of the divine judgment upon evil, but is an attempt to explain the nature and habits of the reptile. A Jewish tradition asserts that previously the serpent had a different body with limbs, and walked as the other creatures. The enmity between the woman and the serpent symbolizes the age- long conflict between evil and good represented respectively by the descend- ants of the woman and the serpent. This passage (3:15) is often called the Protevangelium, or first good tidings. It is, of course, possible to read into it the New Testament doctrine of the redemptive work of Christ. This, however, is not in the text, which expresses merely the idea of a continued struggle between the opposing forces, with loss and suffering to each. It is the function of other portions of Holy Scripture to declare the certainty of the triumph of righteousness. III. SUGGESTED TEACHINGS The Bible ever insists on the freedom of the will to choose the good and reject the evil. No other doctrine is consistent with a moral universe. No other view meets the facts of experience. The rise of doubt is the open door to temptation. In the case of Jesus it was, "If thou be the Son of God." With the woman it was, "Hath God said?" It is ever the nature of temptation to suggest the attainment of knowl- edge through unlawful experience. No appeal to youth is more subtle than this. "Your eyes shall be opened" was the seductive promise. But its fulfilment is ever hollow and disappointing. Knowledge is indeed gained, but it is knowledge which brings only humiliation and regret. "Their eyes were opened and they knew --that they were naked." In every struggle with evil there is the chance of victory. The issue is not certain, else would there be no need of effort. The odds are great, and the promise of wounds and strokes sure. But it is the assurance of the Christ that he is in the conflict by the side of every man who fights the 52</page><page sequence="9">EXPOSITORY STUDIES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 53 good battle, who fights his best and draws not back. The conflict is not ours alone, but God's. THE STORY OF CAIN AND ABEL: GEN. 4:3-I57 I. CRITICAL QUESTIONS The narrative of which this study is a part is taken from the Judean prophetic document known as J. It presents a picture of primitive life with its occupations, religious customs, and even sins, as the Hebrews of a later age conceived it. That the picture as presented is true to the facts of the earliest period cannot be affirmed. The features of the narrative are those of a somewhat advanced, not of the earliest, age. Life has passed out of the mere nomad type, and is marked by the settled occupations of farmer and shepherd. Sacrifice has advanced several stages beyond its earliest form. Society is sufficiently organized to have developed the clan spirit with its law of blood-revenge (vs. 14), and perhaps also the tribal mark or sign (4:16). The value of the story lies, not in the trustworthiness of the incidents which it embodies, but in its interpretation of the causes which lead to such wrecks of character as that represented in the figure of Cain. The story is true to human experience even though it is not fact. The first section of vs. 8 is incomplete. It reads literally, "Cain said to Abel his brother .... ", leaving out the thing said. Several versions -the Samaritan, Septuagint, Peshito, etc.,-supply, "let us go into the field," which has probably dropped out of the Hebrew. II. EXPOSITION The origin of sacrifice is not known with certainty, but it appears to have grown out of the primitive custom of a festival meal at which the deity was an unseen guest, receiving as his share the most highly esteemed portions of the food, viz., the fat and the blood. In the evolution of the ritual the meal gave place to a formal fire-offering with propitiatory sig- nificance. This is the character of the sacrifices presented by Cain and Abel. Each man brought appropriately the fruit of his labors. There is no hint, as has been conjectured, that only animal sacrifices were acceptable. The cause of the rejection of Cain's offering lay in his spirit and temper, not in the nature of his gift. His evil mood was aggravated by the knowl- edge that his offering was not acceptable. The divine word to him is full of gentle rebuke and suggestion of amendment. If he brings his gift with thankfulness and joy, as does 7 International Sunday-School Lesson for January 27,I907.</page><page sequence="10">THE BIBLICAL WORLD Abel, why should he not have a light heart and a cheerful face ? If not, it is because his evil nature lies like a wild beast by the way, ready to spring upon him as he goes out. That sinful desire is plotting for mastery, but he ought to be strong enough to resist and overcome it. The sin of Cain is an advance over that of Adam and Eve, who acknowledged their transgression, but shifted the blame. Cain denies all knowledge or concern. As in the case of Adam, the ground is cursed on account of the sinner. The barrenness of some parts of Palestine could be thus explained by the writer. There is no note of true penitence or sorrow in Cain's words (vss. I3, I4). He is merely alarmed concerning the consequences of his crime. It is clear that the writer holds the view of the localization of each god in his own territory-a very prevalent Old Testament doctrine. Cain, in going out from the land where he has dwelt, is no longer in the sight of Jehovah. It is also assumed, perhaps unconsciously, that the earth is already peopled (e. g., Cain's fear of vengeance from the clan of the murdered man, and his marriage). The sign granted Cain is not merely a promise of protection, but is a token, perhaps a tribal badge. III. SUGGESTED TEACHINGS The only offering with which God can be pleased is that of the heart and will. External gifts may express this, but they can never take its place. Any offering intended as a substitute for righteousness and love, such as sacrifice with the Hebrews, or money today, is worthless. God wants the life, not merely its products. Blood tells. The sin of Adam bears fruit in the perverted nature of Cain. The law of heredity is a blessing to the good and a terror to the evil. Sin is gravitation. Its tendency is to pull a man ever farther down. First with Cain it was an evil temper, then resentment and jealousy, then malice and murder, then brutal indifference to his crime. Sin is the worst of its own punishments. No consequences that follow evil-doing are comparable to the state of pride and impenitence which is itself the essence of sin. Hell is the condition of a life consenting to remain in sin. The mercy of God is greater than the evil of man's life. If there is original sin, still more is there original grace. The divine love anticipates all human need and provides the pathway of return to virtue. The con- sequences of sin cannot be evaded, but through penitence and suffering 54</page><page sequence="11">EXPOSITORY STUDIES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 55 the highway of holiness may be regained. "There's a wideness in God's mercy like the wideness of the sea." NOAH SAVED IN THE ARK: GEN. 8: I--68 I. CRITICAL QUESTIONS The narrative is composite, the result of combining the Judean pro- phetic account, J, with that of the late priestly writer. Even casual reading will discover the variations betwen the two.9 These include (i) the use of the names Jehovah and Elohim respectively; (2) the selection of one pair of unclean and seven pairs of clean animals for preservation according to J, but one pair of all kinds alike in P; (3) the duration of the flood as sixty-one days in J, while the priestly writer makes it a year; (4) in J the deluge is attributed to rain alone, while P speaks of the breaking-up of the subterranean fountains as well as the opening of the upper flood gates; (5) the J account is marked by highly anthropomorphic features (e. g., "Jehovah shut him in," 7:I6; "Jehovah smelled the sweet odor," 8:21), as contrasted with the dignity and reserve of the other narrative. The story of the deluge, although incapable of being related to any historical event of universal extent, and indeed rendered impossible by physical conditions, undoubtedly preserves traditions of local floods such as have given rise to similar accounts among other peoples. Indeed, the number and variety of these flood stories among the various nations show that disasters from inundations were not uncommon, and that they were among the most impressive of human experiences.'? Especially close is the resemblance between the Babylonian flood story and this of Genesis.," Both include the construction of a ship, the preservation of human and animal life by this means, the seven-days' storm, the sending-forth of a dove and a raven, and the sacrifice after departure from the ship. In comparing the two the same difference in tone andreligious significance noted in the creation stories is observed. The polytheistic features have been removed in the biblical account. The narrative is made to serve an ethical and spiritual purpose. II. EXPOSITION The tragedy of all but universal destruction is described in simple but impressive words. Most vivid is the scene as described in the Baby- 8 International Sunday-School Lesson for February 3, I907. o The two strands of the story are discussed in the introductions and commentaries, e.g. Driver, Introduction, 6, p. I4; Genesis, pp. 85 f.; Kent, Beginnings of Hebrew History, p. 63; in the last-named work they are printed in parallel form. Io Lenormant, The Beginnings of History, pp. 382-488.

Ishtar groaned like a woman in travail. The sweet- voiced mistress of the gods wailed." Only the little company in the ark is saved for the future. This is the "remnant" of which the prophets so often spoke, the righteous nucleus which is ever the hope of the kingdom of God. Ararat is a region north of Lake Van, a part of Armenia of modern times. The peak which now bears the name is very lofty and perpetually snow-covered. The construction of the ark is too indefinitely described to afford satis- factory explanation of the opening through which the birds were liberated (see the commentaries on 6: I6 and the description of the ship in the Baby- lonian story). The subsidence of the waters, differing in duration in the two accounts, is revealed in the J narrative by sending out the birds, first a raven, which remained on the wing until the waters sank; then, since the raven did not return, a dove, sent three times over, after which Noah knew that the land was dry and so removed the covering of the ark. The narrative is completed by the departure of all the living things from the ark at the divine command, the sacrifice of Noah (J), and the covenant ratified with the sign of the bow in the cloud (P). m. SUGGESTED TEACHINGS So fatal is human pride and selfishness to the divine purpose for the world that it seemed to the teachers of Israel that the destruction of the race was not too high a price to pay for a fresh start, after the failure of the first experiment. Noah illustrates the type of righteousness that fearlessly champions the cause of truth in a generation of scoffers and apostates. Such men are the holy seed, the mediators of better times. They save not only their own lives, but those about them. It has taken the world centuries to learn, under Christian instruction, that God does not use sudden and catastrophic forces to effect the discipline of human life. There are still, to be sure, such interpretations of disaster and destruction as the manifestations of God's wrath upon sinners. Earthquake and flame are thus interpreted by unreflecting minds. But far deeper and truer is the revelation of the Father given by our Lord. The divine admonitions are silent and continuous. The message of God is not in the storm, the earthquake, and the fire, but in the still small voice.</page></plain_text>
