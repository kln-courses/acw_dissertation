<plain_text><page sequence="1">Time out of Mind: Musical Patterning and Retrospective Coherence in Alexander Aitken's Gallipoli to the Somme Sarah Shieff The first draft of this account was written from memory, aided by a few maps, in Dunedin, New Zealand, between April and September 1917. It was bald and unchaptered... Author's Note, Gallipoli to the Sommex Survivors of traumatic experience seem compelled in one of two directions: either towards silence or towards an urge to bear witness. Both strategies have their dangers: if silence risks repudiating history, an impulse to testify risks the cold shoulder or the uncomprehending stare. To become assimilable, therefore - as commemoration, as testimony, as liberation - trauma narratives need to be more than ťbald and unchaptered': they need to find a form. Alexander Aitken, a talented amateur violinist as well as a mathematical savant, often turned to music as a way of shaping his overwhelming and inescapable memories of active service. I would like to consider the implications of that choice - specifically, the ways in which Aiken uses music to structure his narrative and the emotional landscape of his experience, and what thinking through music might add to our map of the horror to which his memoir bears witness. Aitken had a violin by his side for all eleven months of his active service. This incongruous piece of contraband accrues all manner of significance in the text, for Aitken himself, and for 124</page><page sequence="2">Time out of Mind the many people who help him look after it. What does playing music mean for him? What can those sensitive ears tell us about the experience of trench warfare? If survivors of trauma typically struggle to find a conscious register in which to articulate the memories that haunt them, what might thinking through music enable for someone who, like Aitken, is simply unable to forget? An exceptional memory Aitken's astonishing feats of mental calculation and memory are well-documented.2 As a sixth former at Otago Boys' High School he learned by heart whole books of Paradise Lost and the Aeneid - the latter, in Latin: although mathematics became his professional concern, the schoolboy passions that earned him the nick-name 'Swotty' Aitken were classical languages, literature, music and athletics.3 He was also good at instant recall: he could recite back fifteen-digit numbers after a single hearing, without effort or hesitation.4 Aitken was highly attuned to the system of his own mental skills. He was aware that his own memory functioned best when he was gripped by the material he was being asked to assimilate, and could discern rich conceptual patterns within it. For example, he believed that musical memory could be developed to a more remarkable degree than any other, because music offers just such conceptual richness: we have a metre and a rhythm, a tune, or more than one, the harmony, the instrumental colour, a particular emotion or sequence of emotion, a meaning, however difficult to express in other terms, in the executant an auditory, a rhythmic and a muscular and functional memory; and secondarily in my case, a visual image of the page which comes to the rescue when all the rest 125</page><page sequence="3">Journal of New Zealand Uterature flag; perhaps also a human interest in the composer, with whom one may identify oneself for the time that the composition is being heard or performed; and an aesthetic interest in the form of the piece.5 In the early 1930s, John Sutherland and Boris Semeonoff of the Psychology Department of Edinburgh University designed a series of experimental tasks to assess Aitken's powers of recall and retention.6 Aitken turned to auditory and rhythmic patterns when reflecting on his ability to remember unimaginably long strings of numbers, such as the first ninety-six digits of 1/97* expressed as a recurring decimal. Writing to Sutherland at the time, Aitken 'elucidates' his mnemic process by barring the number into highly-patterned groups as though it were music, and annotating a stress on every second digit as though they were even quavers in 4/ 4 time. He notâtes a pause at the end of each sequence, and accents the terminal digit as though it had the rhythmic value of the last crotchet beat in a bar. He observes that the bars are of unequal time-length, and that the phrases themselves 'are of varied length, as in music, or in breath-groups in singing': 7 •0 |Í0309 2 |783JÓ5Í54 ( ¡391 7 |Í2J773Í 9 |í8762886397938¡ 4 | 432 9 [8969Õ7216 4 1 9484536082474 2 1 26804 1 237 1 | i 3400206 I 83367 | Aitken also reached for a musical analogy in a BBC radio interview in 1954, during which an interviewer gave him a five- digit sequence of pi from 'somewhere in the middle' of the thousand-digit sequence Aitken had committed to memory. He reels off the next fifty digits 'staccato fashion', and explains that he learned the numbers by adopting a certain rhythm. He demonstrates that rhythm by tapping on a desk, five taps per second, with half a second between each group of five, and then compares memorizing numbers to learning music.8 Those who 126</page><page sequence="4">Time out of Mind witnessed such public demonstrations often remarked on the state of 'semi-trance' in which they were performed.9 These examples bring memory, musical shaping and trance states into explicit and suggestive juxtaposition. How might thinking through music help isolate or ward off traumatic memories? How might a familiar cognitive map - in this case, music - help a rememberer frame or contextualise an otherwise unfamiliar and fundamentally unassimilable experience? Music is only one of several patterning devices in Aitken's memoir - devices that function as leitmotifs, selected to give his account retrospective coherence. These range from the sublime to the relatively quotidian. Alex Calder has identified instances when Aitken structures his memory via an awareness of mathematical patterns, and by irony, both of which are associated with patterning.10 Often, an irony inheres in the post facto recognition of a pattern that has failed - usually a tragedy, or a military stupidity - demonstrating what Paul Fussell, quoting Thomas Hardy, calls 'the abridgment of hope'.11 In a different mode, Aitken's memory fixes on astronomy as perpetual and trustworthy. He uses the stars to orient himself in the Northern Hemisphere, and teaches his men to fix the celestial North Pole by reference to the Great Bear, insisting that 'the Germans were to the north of us, and we to the south of them' - a lesson that later saved the lives of several men in another company.12 Aitken also patterns by ellipsis, or apophasis. Such diversions, Kate McLoughlin suggests, work like a sculptor's mould or the artist's depiction of negative space, '[representing] war, as it were, in relief.13 For example, Aitken refuses to describe the groans of the dying on the road in front of Flers, preferring to leave it to 'the sensitive imagination', having discovered that 'horror, truthfully described, weakens to the merely clinical'. Neither will he describe 'accurately or in detail' the new British system of bayonet fighting, because to do so is to 'indict civilization'.14 Elsewhere, he swats away the 'conventional poetry of war', especially by non-combatants such as Tennyson and 127</page><page sequence="5">Journal of New Zealand Uterature Chesterton,15 preferring to focus on details reminding us that the war took place not on some remote plain of combat, but in people's back gardens. Often a hedge-row or fence is all that stands between the bucolic and the infernal as his company steps through yet another gap in yet another a hedge, and down into the trenches.16 Such images exemplify what Aitken elsewhere describes as the slender, random margin separating life and casual death (p. 28). But perhaps the most persistent and multi- dimensional of these retrospective patterns is music. Aitken came to the violin comparatively late. His sister Mary recalled that their father, a hardworking Dunedin grocer, managed somehow to provide the small sum necessary to give Alec one term's tuition with an almost blind fiddler, who guided Alec's fingers by touch, but couldn't see what he was doing with the instrument - and that was all the tuition he ever had for the violin - he learnt by listening to and watching other players, and by reading books such as Leopold Auer's Howl Teach the Violin}1 From all accounts, this lack of formal tuition didn't hold him back. Eric Fenby, Frederick Delius's amanuensis, described Aitken as the most accomplished amateur violinist he had known.18 Aiken was the leader of the Edinburgh University Musical Society orchestra,19 and he was a regular member of a piano quartet in Edinburgh.20 His friend and colleague David Kendall recalled that 'he once told my wife that for 75 per cent of the time he was thinking of music'. Kendall wryly adds that ťhe must have employed the other 25 per cent to very great purpose'.21 128</page><page sequence="6">Time out of Mind Travels of a violin Aitken acquired his wartime instrument on a troop ship en route to Egypt in August 1915, when a friend won it in a raffle and handed it on: '[m]ediocre in tone and cheap, it was wonderful to have in such a place' (p. 4). Although it was contrary to regulations, he 'was determined in spite of this to smuggle it along as far as [he] could' (p. 4). Embarking for Gallipoli, it was inconspicuously transferred from hand to hand among members of his section in one of the rear platoons. Later, climbing Chailak Dere, he 'more than once [. . .] felt like throwing [it] away down the stream-bed, but members of the section took turns with me in carrying it up the slope' (p. 23). At the head of the dere they dug shallow slots among the roots of ilex bushes, where Aitken slept with his fiddle-case beside him. Learning that they were to make a further climb of a quarter of a mile to the trenches further up Chunuk Bair, he left the violin in the care of an Australian stretcher-bearer. Returning to retrieve it weeks later, he found the Australian's dug-out empty - he speculates illness or injury - but the instrument itself safe. In the build-up to the December evacuation, Aitken was assigned for a week to the Auckland Battalion. In the evenings, they held muted concerts in the largest dug-out close to an Auckland trench known as Grafton Road: 'My E-string had gone, but a resourceful Aucklander unravelled the strands of a short length of six-ply field telephone wire, and these substitutes served until I bought proper strings in Cairo next April' (p. 35). During the withdrawal itself, Aitken left the violin in the care of Major W. W. Alderman's batman, Chadwick. He regretted its loss as inevitable, but back on Lemnos Chadwick came looking for him, violin case in hand: 'The Major [. . .] had been kind. "Shove it in with my stuff', he had said, "some fellows get attached to these things"; and thus it had been among the last personal belongings to come away from Anzac' (p. 42). 129</page><page sequence="7">Journal of New Zealand Uterature In France Aitken took the violin with him into the support trenches in the Armentières salient and again slept with it by his side, but soon recognised that '[playing] it in the open was inviting trouble, and to play it in the confined space of the dug- out was impossible' (p. 71), so he left it in the care of one of the sisters at their billet at the Hospice Mahieu. Later, in Abbeville, the newly-minted Second Lieutenant Aitken spent his £25 uniform allowance on a new set of strings and a bow, bought from an old musical instrument dealer in a spirit of what he calls 'irrational optimism' (p. 120). Then the acceleration to the Somme begins. He leaves the violin in the care of his own batman Scott, and records, 'for envoi', the list of names he had written in indelible ink on the bai2e lining of the case: 8/2524, Indian Ocean , Aden , Sue% Cairo (Zeitoun), Alexandria, Sarpi (Lemnos j, An^ac, Mudros East, Moascar, Suei i Canal, Feny, Ismailia, Port Said, Marseille, Morbecque, Steenbecque, Estaires, Armentières, Wardrecques, Citernes, Airaines, Tirancourt, Coisy, Fricourt (pp. 132-133). Again he imagines it lost, and injury ended his active service on 27 Sept 1916. Against all odds, however, the violin returns to him some eighteen months later. He devotes his epilogue to its subsequent history: It had been picked up, had trundled round with the Company field kitchens, and must at various times have been near Messines and Ypres. Cuthbert Parr, going on leave to London in 1918, had it packed for me by Hawkes &amp; Co., the music firm, and forwarded to Dunedin. In 1952 Mr. H. P. Kidson, former Rector of the Otago Boys High School, visiting me in Edinburgh, took it back to New Zealand, and presented it on my behalf to the school on 3rd August 1953, the ninetieth anniversary 130</page><page sequence="8">Time out of Mind of the foundation. It now reposes in a glass case in the front hall, with a suitably brief inscription (p. 177). If, as Tim O'Brien suggests, personal as much as military necessity determines the contents of an infantryman's kit, what might it mean to have a violin amongst the things he carried?22 Setting off from on what will be a thirteen-and-a-half mile march across cobblestones from Hazebrouck to Estaires, Aitken put his pack on the quartermaster's scales: Web equipment, 120 rounds of ammunition, valise with clothing and greatcoat inside, waterproof sheet and blanket, rifle and bayonet, steel shrapnel helmet, two gas helmets, filled water-botde, entrenching tool and handle, haversack with rations; contraband additions, nominally not allowed but so far connived at: some books and the violin and case. Total weight, 74 lb., statutory weight, 62 lb (p. 63). Carrying something extra under those conditions simply had to be worth it, for the people around him as much as for himself. Before they had even left Egypt, Aitken says, the violin had become virtually a platoon mascot (p. 4) - that is, something around which a group identity coheres, and which embodies the virtues that the group might wish to find in itself. The behaviour of those who look after the violin suggests a considerable emotional investment in its meanings. It stands for civilized, peacetime pursuits; playing the violin builds communities who take a shared pleasure in music, and who respect the effort of acquiring that skill. Caring for the instrument dramatises at a very personal level faith in war aims that must at times have felt remote: they are, after all, fighting to protect vulnerable things. And, as Aitken observed during the evacuation from Gallipoli, these values transcend entrenched structures of class and rank. My students also like to point out that the violin is somewhat feminine in shape. Although musicians themselves tend not to 131</page><page sequence="9">journal of New Zealand Uterature think of their instruments in such explicitly anthropomorphic terms, the image of Aitken tucking down to sleep beside his violin does conjure a touchingly displaced domesticity. For all parties involved with its care, then, the violin seems to stand for the inverse of 'abridged hope'. Their present actions with regard to the instrument express their faith in a future in which cherishing such an object, and what it stands for, is not remotely incongruous. If the violin has its own history as a marker of Aitken's 'irrational optimism', his memories of his own playing, and his awareness of music in the world around him, pull that redemptive arc in rather more complex directions. Aitken obviously enjoyed playing for others: he tells us that Dvorak's 'Humoresque' was requested so often that it became something of a signature tune (p. 4). He plays when music helps enhance a sense of community: there may have been no room for the sweep of the bow-arm in that freezing Auckland dug-out, and 'the Humoresque , or anything like it, was out of key with Gallipoli; but Christmas was near, and carols with muted obbligati were softly intoned. In its time The First Noweli will have been sung in strange places; this dug-out under Chunuk Bair must have been one of the strangest' (p. 35). He plays as a gift for others. On his last evening as a non-commissioned officer, the Sergeants' Mess of the 10th Otago Company bought two ducks, and paid a French mademoiselle to prepare a five-course dinner in his honour: 'wonderful it seemed, and voice and violin suitably responded' (p. 118). A few days later, they say goodbye to the beloved nuns of Hospice Mahieu in Armentières: 'on request, and in a token of farewell, the violin for the last time in the Hospice played the ever-popular Humoresque1 (p. 112). All this is very much in the spirit of community and demonstrates faith in what music might represent in a world beyond war. But the narrative is also patterned by occasions on which Aitken plays by and for himself. Playing the violin 132</page><page sequence="10">Time out of Mind provides a degree of psychic insulation from some of the more trying aspects of life in barracks: without making too much of it, playing is a way of quiedy setting himself apart. In Zeitoun camp, for example, he prefers to stay behind and practice in an almost empty hut, while everyone else makes a bee-line for the flesh- pots of Cairo. Later, in Estaires, he finds himself court-martialled on a trivial charge. Aitken and his sergeant were responsible for a group of German POWs. While Aitken was laying out his equipment on an upper floor of their billet, a disused flour mill, the sergeant had wandered fifty yards up the road ťin quest of local beauty and elegance' (p. 64). With both backs turned, a prisoner escaped and was quickly recaptured, but Aitken and the sergeant found themselves under arrest until such time as the matter could be referred to the Orderly Room and quietly dismissed. Thanks to the violin, being confined to barracks becomes more like being sentenced to days in a conservatorium practice studio. For that period, Aitken and his guard, a former school chum, were able to enjoy some distance from the routines of military life: 'Thus, while the rest were at drill or route- marching, we rested our feet, and he provided audience for much violin practice, including Bach's Chaconne ' (p. 64). As if to underscore the gap he wants to register between himself and the cruder realities of army life, he next describes a little item he and his guard unearthed while exploring the mill: [we found], scribbled on loose sheets, in local dialect and with many faults of grammar, a crude ballad - one might render it The Belle of Estaires - a small drama in rhyme founded on the coming of the English soldiery, and by no means prudish. If I recall, as I seem to do, that one refrain was something like Mainte jeune demoiselle I Tortera un bébé , I need say no more by way of description. I lost these sheets; linguistically they might have had some interest, for, [. . .] this region where French and Flemish meet is the Teutonic strand against which the farthest 133</page><page sequence="11">Journal of New Zealand Uterature waves of the Latin tongue, in early centuries, lapped to a bilingual standstill (p. 64). The larger pattern of the narrative similarly shows an oscillation between the lyrical and the obscene, often in explicitly musical terms. Over three paragraphs, Aitken moves from grenade training at Terdeghem, to watching a petrol-shower incendiary bomb descending on ripening crops near Nieppe, and back to the Hospice Mahieu, where he discovered the violin in such good condition that he could almost believe one of the Sisters had been keeping it in tune (p. 86). The story of the violin, and Aitken's memory of playing - the armature it provides - counterbalance an experience that must have mostly felt irrational, violent, pointless, and tragic. Beyond that, Aitken is also acutely aware of music in his aural environment. He offers transcriptions of the chant of the Lake Timsah boatmen (p. 52), and a Lemnian children's song (p. 14), which he speculates is of relatively recent Italian origin. One quiet evening on Lemnos he hears the monks of an enclosed order intoning at 12.00, far within, a chant in the Phrygian or some other ancient mode, too indistinct for me to memorize or to write down on the stave. Pitch was given from time to time by a bare fifth or octave sounded on some instrument like a viola; the feeling was Byzantine, and something very like it is to be found in the second of Gustav Hoist's Four Songs for Voice and Violin , not then composed (p. 12). This monastic singing typifies a more general atmosphere of 'dedicated retreat from the world' (p. 13) that Aitken detects in the islands of the northern Aegean - an apotropaic retreat that we can also hear in his own memories: 'I dwell on such slight recollections, which have little intrinsic interest, as if reluctant to 134</page><page sequence="12">Time out of Mind pack up and leave for Gallipoli, which indeed I have temporarily forgotten' (p. 14). If Aitken often turns to music when he wants to suggest positive patterns to do with peace, community and optimism, he also thinks through music in a rather less literal way. Thinking about musical patterns - specifically, music as structured time - is also a way of registering autonomy and individuality in the face of the grinding stasis and depersonalization of trench warfare. I suggested before that Aitken's narration tends to oscillate between the lyrical and the infernal. One of the key demonic aspects of trench warfare, especially as the war ground into its third year, was its feeling of interminability, registered in the phrase 'a war of attrition', which, Aitken notes, came into vogue around the time of the Somme offensives in July 1916 (p. 89). He also notes that the word, and the theory, were the by-product, the cover and an attempt towards the palliation of the enormous losses sustained in these great 'pushes', which for the gain of ten miles of advance might mean the loss of 200,000 men. Much of this was not attrition at all, but the arbitrary throwing away of lives (pp. 89-90). Where might the imagination find its tropes for the experience of being mired, bogged down in one futile action after another? The soldiers themselves found a musical expression of those feelings of stuckness in the improvised marching song: 'We're here because we're here', sung to the tune of 'Aulde Lang Syne', combines the illusion of forward momentum while simultaneously registering a resigned futility.23 Aitken finds an apt emblem for the sensation of stopped time in Arementières, where a clock in a bombed square near the hospice points permanendy to eleven thirty (p. 67). The sensation of being mired is rather more literal in the trenches themselves, where 135</page><page sequence="13">Journal of New Zealand Uterature 'stale, foul-smelling water from the winter rains stagnated in the floor of the trenches under the rotting duck-boards' (p. 73). Aitken's recourse to music at moments of especial stuckness - entombed in a coffin-slot on Gallipoli; playing Bach under house arrest in Estaires - offers a kind of imaginative resistance to that stymied sense of purpose, that feeling that time has stopped. To play is to give a shape to time, when there is so little sense, otherwise, of a beginning or a middle - let alone an end. Playing gives the musician the sense of forward momentum, and a felt sense of personhood. You can see this on the faces of absorbed musicians everywhere: that combination of concentration, pleasure, transport - an inward state that might best be described as time out of mind. But on the Somme, the stopping of time is only an illusion. Zero hour will be announced; they mil go over the top. As Aitken waits in his trench before what will be a resoundingly successful assault on a German communication trench known as Goose Alley, he calculates the rate of progress his platoon will need to maintain in order to reach their objective, some seven hundred yards distant. They must walk behind a moving barrage at the rate of exacdy fifty yards per minute - that is, he says, at exacdy half ordinary marching pace. Aitken's scrupulous metrical sense invites the reader to imagine normal marching tempo - 'Colonel Bogey', say, or ťThe Radetsky March', or 'The Stars and Stripes Forever', all of which barrel along at about 120 beats per minute - and then walk, counting, as he does in his twenty-three minutes in no man's land, nought abc , 1 abc , 2 abc ' taking one full pace every second. The reality may be unprecedented and all- but-incommunicable, but Aitken's calm and efficient language nonetheless manages to evoke a startlingly precise physical memory. Interestingly, as the crescendo to the Somme builds, Aitken's explicidy musical allusions drop away, and his aural environment is dominated instead by an awareness of the noise of trench warfare. The day after this successful raid, Aitken lies wounded, 136</page><page sequence="14">Time out of Mind curled like a hedgehog in his shell-hole. His mathematical self is aware of aural patterns - but this time as sound, not music. Amidst the uproar, he hears a regularity in a certain type of explosion, calculates that an approaching pair of howitzer shells will bear down on his shell-hole in about ten minutes, and determines to crawl to the relative safety of a low bank beside a narrow country road. From there, he hears two successive bursts straddling the road: 'I could not raise my head to look, but judged that the later one must have landed very close to the shell-hole I had first occupied' (p. 172). Unlike his friend Frank Tucker, who was haunted by Shakespeare and Beethoven in similar circumstances, Aitken thinks of himself as wholly mathematical, coolly aware that solving this intellectual problem will save his life. Music and traumatic memory Music therapists who specialise in the treatment of trauma tell us that music can be a powerful resource for finding a form within which to begin to adjust to the fragmentation and chaos of extreme experiences - experiences in which existence itself may have been threatened. Music also offers a space for the traumatic experience itself to begin to find form, or 'come into form'.24 One final example illustrates Aitken's recourse to music as a way of finding form in fragmentation and chaos. The memoir is also patterned by his scrupulous memorializing of people he knew - name, place and date of death - on every second or third page. These names toll like passing bells, or, perhaps more apdy given Aitken's love of Bach, like the relendess repetitions of the ostinato bass line found in a chaconne or passacaglia.25 Again and again, Aitken turned to Bach for the certainties and consoling forms he needed to insulate him from his appalling memory. Eric Fenby wrote to him in 1951: 137</page><page sequence="15">Journal of New Zealand Uterature I thank God you have your Bach. No composer could possibly appeal to and satisfy your whole complicated nature as he. Other musicians for an hour may be, but Bach always. Nor do I associate you with any other composer. Watching you playing Bach during that delightful evening in your music-room, I felt so long as you play Bach daily, so long will you keep going. As to your war experiences [...] Bach can only help you to dim the memories of such horror.26 The music of Bach could also be said to provide a model for Aitken's restraint and economy of language, and for the memoir's larger structures. Every Anzac Day, Aitken's violin is taken out and displayed on stage at Otago Boys' High,27 honouring his intention that the instrument should be 'a reminder to all who see it, of the service and sacrifice of New Zealanders in the First World War' (p. 177). Even more than the physical object, however, it is Aitken's account that bears witness to that sacrifice. The familiar paradigms of trauma studies suggest that traumatic memories tend to be intractable and inaccessible. Aitken did suffer from terrible depressions, and his war experience haunted him all his life. But to suggest that his war memories were in some way inassimilable is to grossly misrepresent his achievement. If, as Kate McLoughlin suggests, war writing is simultaneously impossible and necessary, and if war resists representation even as it demands it,28 Aitken's narrative shows what writing can achieve in the face of the unimaginable. 138</page><page sequence="16">Time out of Mind Notes 1 Alexander Aitken, Gallipoli to the Somme: Recollections of a New Zealand Infantryman (London: Oxford University Press, 1963).
