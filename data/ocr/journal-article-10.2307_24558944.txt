<plain_text><page sequence="1">iary of an Elisionist Ellsworth Kelly's Tablet 1948-1973 by Carter RatclifF D In 1973, Ellsworth Kelly moved from downtown Manhattan to Spencertown, in upstate New York. From this new beginning came the impetus to deal with an old habit. For more than two decades, the artist had been making quick sketches on scraps of paper scav enged from a variety of sources: scratch pads, newspapers, magazines, flyers and brochures, and things that come in the mail—not only envelopes but gallery announcements and even letters from friends. Settled in his new studio, Kelly realized that he didn't want to throw out this accu mulation. Nor did he want to leave it in an unsorted heap. Over the decades, it had become his diary of visual ideas. Feeling the need for order—or neatness—he had an assis tant mount these bits and pieces on sheets of matboard. Each sheet is the same size—15-1/2x21 in.—yet no uniform format prevails. A few of these creamy white sur faces bear seven or eight sketches; some have just two. On average, there are three to five: enough to command the surface without seeming to overcrowd it. By titling the entire array Tablet 1948—1973, Kelly converted hundreds of fragments into a single work. In May, 188 of the mat board sheets went on view at the Drawing Center in New York. Curated by Yves-Alain Bois, the exhibition (through July 24) has been given permanent form in the full-color reproductions of a limited-edition book. Hung close together in sets of two, one above the other, the pages of Tablet stretch in a double line across every wall of the Drawing Center's ample gallery. Not far along, I felt lost. Or, sensing the absence of any sequential logic, I felt I ought to feel lost—ought to feel the disorientation that, according to a familiar scenario, precedes a new under standing of a challenging body of work. But it was diffi cult to claim confusion when every step brought me face to face with a flurry of Kelly's familiar shapes: his squares, rectangles, and rhomboids; his skewed curves and elegant ly eccentric angles; his leaf-shapes and notched forms and vaguely anthropomorphic Xs. Of course there was much more to be seen. Though he is often mistaken for a geo metrician—an abstractionist who takes a few shapes ready made from Euclid—Kelly is among the most inventive artists of his era. Not feeling lost in the plenitude of Tablet, I jumped to the conclusion that I was being offered the pleasures of familiarity. This was only partly true.

Though he isn't averse to pencil, Kelly usually sketch es in ink, producing a line of remarkable authority. I don't mean that his marks are aggressive, and they certainly aren't expressive in any ordinary sense. The strength of his line is in its formal certainty. Nearly always, shapes appear with the least possible degree of fuss—not that Kelly never revises. Here and there a second thought gives a rectangle a slightly different proportion or shifts the speed of a sweeping curve. Usually, though, he tends to redraw rather than revise. In the upper left-hand corner of sheet #34, a corner torn from a yellow legal pad bears a precise sketch of a two-toned triangle. Just to the right is another triangle, this one formed when Kelly snipped off the corner of a mag azine page. The juxtaposition of gray field and black mar gin gives this triangle a pattern of two tones as well. To the far right is a third triangle, this one readymade: solid black ink on the yellowed background of an advertising layout. The rough quality of the paper and the printing identifies this as a neatly clipped piece of newsprint, as do the minute serrations that run along its upper edge. The inti book form, Tablet is more like a diary, as I've suggested, or a dossier of partially sorted evidence in the Case of the Articulated Emptiness. For there is a puzzle in Kelly's art, which he poses with each of his shapes, whatever its size. Why do these blank expanses look so complete, so thor oughly realized? How is it that they seem realized not just as forms but also as presences, almost as actual personages? Any answer to these questions has to begin with a fresh look at the particularity of Kelly's shapes. The Minimalists used squares. So did the artists of de Stijl and the Bauhaus. For them, the square was a stepping-stone to the univer sal. For Kelly, it is an occasion to deploy a color so distinc tive, so precisely adjusted to the size of a certain square surface, that it becomes recognizably his. Because I am so impatient with the universalizing impulses of the mod ernist tradition, I am tempted to say that Kelly's purpose is to defeat the generality—the dreary impersonality—of the square. And impersonality doesn't have a chance in the vicinity of his curves and other irregular forms. These are his the way the shape of his skull and the tone of his voice are his. Time and again, Tablet shows the emergence of the par ticular, sometimes in the quick flicker of lines in ink. Or a readymade form becomes his the moment he claims it. Of Why do these blank expanses look so complete, so thoroughly realized? How is it that they seem realized not just as forms but also as presences, almost as actual personages? macy of Tablet encourages a fixation on detail. I found myself examining erasures as carefully as lines left undis turbed. Stains began to look as interesting as washes of color laid on with deliberation. But Kelly's characteristic shapes remain the focus of attention, no matter how beguiling a crease or rip in a scrap of paper might be. It is remarkable how little this artist's forms suffer from miniaturization. Even the smallest ones keep their scale, which is big. At first, this seemed to be an effect of mem ory: having seen these forms as full-size canvases and wall sculptures, I was endowing them with a scale they don't possess on their own. Or so I thought, yet this was a mis take, at least in some instances. Many of the triangles, poly gons, and other Kellyesque shapes in Tablet are fully achieved, not tentative first steps from small to big, from sketch to finished work. The refined authority of Kelly's forms is present at the outset, in his most casual scrib blings. He never has to struggle for it. Spread across the gallery walls, Tablet absorbed me the way a long shelf of books might, with its pattern of simi larities and differences, its connections and disjunctions. In course these appropriations are never complete and in some cases can only be ironic. Sheet #103 includes a reproduction of Vermeer's The Little Street, a picture inex tricably connected to the artist who made it. All Kelly can claim is an interest in the triangles and rectangles of Vermeer's architecture—an interest elaborated by the sketches in casual orbit around The Little Street. All the images in sheet #65 were clipped from newspapers: pho tographs of sailboats, the arches of the Brooklyn Bridge, cables of the Golden Gate Bridge, and more. Again, Kelly's interest is clear. These are geometric forms made particu lar by point of view and the contingencies of use—wind, for example, relieves sails of their simple triangularity. In the lower left-hand corner of sheet #34, a flattened Sno-cone holder counts as yet another Kellyesque trian gle. This one is isosceles, with its short edge curved. And, if you can ignore the snowman and a few typographical distractions, another field-and-border pattern appears. In much art, the particular is the product of proliferating detail. The need to overlook the snowman on the Sno cone reminds us that Kelly arrives at particularity by way 32 July-August 2002</page><page sequence="4">Tablet #34. ink and printed paper (39.4x53.3 cm), 1950s or '60s.

Whatever preserves its individual ity—color, proportions, subtlety of outline—gives the form its reason for being a part of Kelly's universe. When he draws on a scrap of printed matter, Kelly hardly ever aligns a shape with patterns or images already in place. Rather, he situates his form in a way that takes all the local configurations into account. So when he pencils a rectangle onto a rectangle of newsprint, as in sheet #92, he doesn't center it. Rather, he offsets it to acknowledge— however obliquely—the background pattern of columns and borders. This asymmetrical placement sets up certain tensions, which Kelly both accentuates and resolves with a taut curve reaching from the top to the bottom edge of the penciled rectangle. Sheet #27 displays seven ovoid forms on five pieces of paper, one of them a portion of a letter written by hand. The correspondent's words are widely spaced. In enclosing them with a dark line, Kelly tried to give each word as much elbow room as the words give each other. This wasn't always possible. On the right, the words push Kelly's line to the edge of the paper. At every point, he has taken into is the contingency of his forms, and thus of their mean ings. Kelly makes art by reflecting on what he sees, then reflecting on his reflections, and so on. The point is to draw the audience into the process, in the hope that each one of us will respond with conscious individuality to whatever is individual, particular, contingent in a Kellyesque form. The realm of the contingent is everyday life, and the virtue of Tablet is to show Kelly's sensibility interacting with it—making his particular of sense of bits and pieces of the mundane. Of course, the mundane can also be cruel. Sheet #7 includes a large scrap cut from what appears to be a Sunday newspaper supplement photograph from the late 1960s or early '70s. Against a backdrop of lush green, an American soldier advances, rifle in hand, on a captured member of the Vietcong. Kelly's overlay of squar ish shapes makes no acknowledgement of this scene or its horror. Thus it would be easy to argue that his art is the work of an aesthete with no sense of responsibility to any thing but the cultivation of his sensibility. Those who condemn Kelly as an aesthete are wrong, yet their mistake is a useful reminder of the obvious: he is Impersonality doesn't have a chance in the vicinity of Kelly's curves and other irregular forms.These are his the way the shape of his skull and the tone of his voice are his. account not only the flow of the handwritten words but their relation to the surface on which they appear. Thus he responded to a situation on terms set by the situation itself. The result was one of his distinctive forms. But just a moment, you might say. At home on any suf ficiently spacious wall in any gallery, Kelly's big, mono chrome pieces are hardly site-specific. That's true, yet each brings with it a sense of site, a memory of a place of ori gin. For Kelly's quietly monumental works of art begin with glances at ordinary things. Some of his photographs show how this happens—how, for example, a stucco wall in perspective becomes a rhomboid-shaped painting. To see these forms fully is to sense, however tenuously, their places of origin. Tablet presents both forms and origins together. Massive but not monumental, Tablet reiterates at length the point that Kelly's other works, especially his ink draw ings and photographs, have long been trying to make: his subject is not geometry and certainly not any of the absolutes that geometric form has so often been made to symbolize. Nor is his subject the flicker of perception that leaves its traces in even his most austere works. His subject not politically engaged, at least not directly. He does noth ing to defend our best—which is to say, our most rapidly eroding—values. Instead, he elaborates them, as if he lived in a future that had made those values secure. For Kelly is a Utopian, American-style, who projects an ideal world not by promulgating absolutes—that way lies fascism—but by inflecting the ordinary with his most generous percep tions, impulses, and feelings, on the assumption that all of us can join him, even at his most subtle. That way lies democracy. Carter Ratcliff, a contributing editor to Art On Paper, is a poet and art critic living in New York.
