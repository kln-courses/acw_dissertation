<plain_text><page sequence="1">OBSERVATIONS ON THE TEXT OF OLYMPIODORUS ON PLATO'S GORGIAS BY HAROLD TARRANT The translation of a substantial work of Greek or Latin entails the kind of detailed reading which is likely to suggest, or even demand, changes to the received text which have not been thought necessary by those only editing. While working on a translation of Olympio- dorus5 commentary on the Gorgias recendy1), it not only became ob- vious to me that L.G. Westerink's careful edition of the text2), itself far superior to that of Norvin3), and able to benefit from a variety of other emendations proposed by reviewers of this earlier edition4), is not beyond improvement, but also that some possible improve- ments would have suggested themselves to any competent translator in due course. The received text was not originally in good shape, not so much because the text of M (Marcianus Graecus 196 Z), the only authoritative manuscript, had been handed down by a particu- larly incompetent succession of scribes, but rather because the text 1) Olympiodorus, Commentary on Plato's Gorgias, translated with full notes by Ro- bin Jackson, Kimon Lycos, and Harold Tarrant, Philosophia Antiqua (Leiden 1998). 2) Olympiodorus, In Platonis Gorgiam Commentaria, ed. L.G. Westerink (Leipzig 1970). 3) Olympiodorus, In Platonis Gorgiam Commentaria, ed. W. Norvin (Leipzig 1936). 4) Notably those of R. Beutler in Gnomon 14 (1938), 318-22, and P. Maas in ByzZ 37 (1937), 181-4. His edition seems not to take into account the textual obser- vations by CA. Behr, Citations of Porphyry's Against Aristides preserved in Olympiodorus, AJPh 89 (1968), 186-99, but this is scarcely critical, since it seems that only one emendation proposed there had not been previously supported, and this one, the addition of ?? e?pe? so as to read f?s?? d? &lt;?? e?pe?&gt; ? f???s?f?? ???????? at 32.2, p. 164.5W, is clearly erroneous. The effect of the emendation is to credit an analogy, based on Republic IV, between three types of rhetoric and three types of medicine, to Porphyry rather than to Olympiodorus' teacher Ammonius; but Ammonius, mentioned only ten times altogether, is twice more mentioned in med- ical contexts (40.5 and 42.6), and once more in relation to Republic IV (42.2). In fact Republic IV is so crucial to Olympiodorus' concept of constitutional well-being (p???- t??? e?da?????a) on which his whole reading of the Gorgias depends, that any ratio- nal guess would postulate a special interest in this book on Ammonius' part. ?

I shall therefore run through the emendations to the text of Wes- terink that form the basis for our translation, some firmly based, and others more hopeful, some already suggested by Westerink in his ap- paratus or by another scholar; and go through various cases where M appears to give a wrong reading of the kind which is more like- ly to have occurred as a result of the recorder's mishearing than the copyist's misreading?for one assumes that the editor should try to capture the words of the lecture in preference to those of the re- corder. But I begin with a rather different issue which involves a matter of principle, and might involve transposition, and follow this with a second suggested transposition. 1. Did the Sturer slip up? Olympiodorus has usually received a hostile press. It frequently seems that he makes errors of the kind that a philosophic author would not be expected to have made, and one has to force oneself to recall the greater fallibility of the modern academics within the class-room (even when well prepared) than within their private study. In the case of authors who quietly record their own thoughts there is no great gulf between their intentions and what they actu- ally write, and hence there is no need for the editor to choose be- tween the tasks of reconstructing the original text and reconstructing what was intended. In the case of a written record of a lecture there may be this further editorial problem: in addition to any difference between restoring the recorder's record and between restoring what was said, one may also have to distinguish between what was intend- ed to be said, and what was actually said in the class-room. In this context I should like to consider a possible transposition: 19.11. ?? d?ta, ? ???e, ???a ad??at??6)? epe?d? e?pe? ? ????? ?t? [??7)] ?a?ep?? ?st? t? ?????a? se, ?

Now the comments are not directed very specifically at 473b8-l 1, for Polus had here (b8-9) just claimed that Socrates' most recent the- ory was more difficult to refute than an earlier one: cBut this is still more difficult to refute than that was, Socrates.' In fact one is reminded more of Polus' remark 'It is difficult to refute you, Socra- tes' at 470c4?a remark which Olympiodorus had explained as an ironical substitute for 'It is easy ....' (In Grg. 18.6). This seems to have been a favourite point, since Socrates' amplification of Polus' literal rather than intended meaning again features at 20.1. The scholia on the Gorgias, clearly related to the activities of Olympiodorus' school10), also comment on the irony of Polus at 470c4 and 473b8-9, and on Socrates' deliberately taking Polus in the wrong sense at 473b 10. We may imagine then that our lecturer was keen to make his point, as soon as Socrates says 'Impossible'. There is a further point. It is difficult to see how Socrates could be said to be saying 'It is difficult,...' at 473b 1, when the Greek says ?? d?ta, ? ???e, ???' ad??at??. Here Plato is contradicting Polus, but Olympiodorus has him agreeing with him. It should now be noticed that the discussion of 47 3b 10 occurs at the wrong point in the text, before one on 473a3 (19.12), and, more worryingly, before one on the very remark of Polus at 473b8 to which Socrates is giving his clever answer (19.13). This is a very strange order, and one has to ask whether Olympiodorus' eye had not fallen prematurely on 472d6, where Socrates says something similar ('And I say it's impossible'), though in a completely different context. A comment on 472d6 would be in the right place, so that it seems entirely plausible that Olympiodorus had prepared his mate- rial for 473b 10, but erroneously delivered it in relation to similar wording at 472d6! 8) 470c4: on Polus' irony see on 18.3. 9) 'No Polus, it's impossible' (473b 10): because Polus had said It is difficult to refute you', Socrates says 'It is difficult, because it is impossible'. For Polus ironi- cally said 'difficult' instead of 'easy'. However, Socrates reverses the meaning and says 'Refutation is difficult, because it is impossible'. 10) These have been usefully edited by M. Carbonara Naddei, Gli Scoli Grea al Gorgia di Platone, testo, traduzione e note (Bologna 1976).</page><page sequence="4">26 HAROLD TARRANT Should an editor then restore the discussion at In Grg. to what is indisputably its right place in the text, between the present 19.13 and 19.14? Or should we leave it at 19.11 on the grounds that the lec- turer probably did deliver his comment at that point? We certainly cannot restore all the lemmata to their natural order, for the lectur- er occasionally notes that he is going to go back and make a point that had been missed11), and this is clearly of interest to us in that it is testimony to the classroom situation; and again 19.15 seems at first sight to be out of place, as the lemma is taken from 472dl-2, but in this case the remarks are clearly supposed to comment gen- erally upon the whole passage between 472d and 473bll, so that their presence at the end of lecture 19 is again a genuine reflection of class-room tactics. In the case of 19.11, however, I believe that it would be best to restore it to its proper place in the running com- mentary, but for one thing: the fact that the remark is not entirely in place, because of the comparative just used by Polus and the ?? d?ta of Socrates' response. 2. Another transposition: Before proceeding to simpler emendations, I should like to propose a further transposition. At 20.2 one reads as follows: ??ta ? ????? t?? S????t??? ??e?????a? ?????????? t??? p?????? a?- ???p??? e?? ?a?t???a? ?a?e?, ?a??? ?e p???? de? ?a? ?p?de??t???? s???????es?a? ?a? ?? ?p? t?? ?????, ?e??? t????? ????? pa?ad?d??ta? ?a? ?p?da? ????sta? d????e?a? ?ate???sa? ???? ta p??? ?a? e?pe?? a?- t??? ???ete ?t???a? ?? de??????12). ???e? t????? ?

The first t????? introduces a matter that the previous sentences can- not in fact explain, and the second does not appear to be giving a consequence of the need to charm the passions. What have these 11)12.11, 13.10, 41.10, 48.10. 12) The quotation is from Euripides Orestes 258. 13) Then, when Socrates wants to be refuted, Polus calls the many to witness, acting wrongly. For we should construct demonstrative arguments and not [argue] by appeal to the mob. So divine sayings and powerful charms are handed down,</page><page sequence="5">OLYMPIODORUS ON PLATO'S GORGIAS 27 divine spells got to do with demonstrative arguments, or with So- crates' lack of experience of public affairs?

It contains the term ????????e?a, and hence has been brought to mind by ???????tt? at 473d3, and the antidote to these 'bogeyman' tactics are there the charms of the ?pfd??. There is no doubt that 20.3 has begun with an allusion to the Phaedo (with its reference to the frightening of children), and hence there should be no doubt that the reference to calming charms follows nat- urally at this point. things which are able to put our passions to sleep and to say to us 'Remain undis- turbed in your bed'. So Socrates says ? am not one of the statesmen/?that is, one of the run-of-the-mill kind?'for example I was laughed at some time ago over the counting of the votes'. 14) Westerink prints a?t??, but the point of Olympiodorus' comment is that Polus is trying to stir up the fearful litde child in Socrates. In these circumstances Socrates needs to carefully calm these childish feelings (fear of death etc.) by saying things which will counter them. He must be released from the effect that Polus' words might naturally have. The term e???t?? remains difficult to translate, with two possible ideas behind it: that Socrates is disengaging himself from the discus- sion, and more importantly that he is releasing himself from the effect of childish feelings. I read f??e?? for f???, with the scholion. 15) cf. In Grg. 5.3, 26.10, 39.8, 41.6.</page><page sequence="6">28 HAROLD TARRANT 3.

In the first case it is highly unlikely that the lec- turer said anything different, for ?? s?? would sound almost identi- cal to e? ??, and I should restore the former at proem 8. In the sec- ond case it is likely that the eta and upsilon would have sounded extremely close at this time, so that the difference is really a matter of a single consonant. 3.2: d?af??e? t????? e?pe???a pe??a? ?t? ? ??? e?pe???a ?a? ?p? p??- ?e?? ???eta?, ? d? pe??a ?p? t?? ?at? ????? te???t??, (?. 25.2-4) Here a better contrast with p???e?? is achieved by reading the neuter te?????? rather than te???t??.

The answer that Socrates wants is a noun (orator), not an adjective (admirable). Hence it is best to restore ??t??a from the Platonic text (448e7). This is strongly suggested also by 2.8 (p. 20.7): ?st?? est?. 3.10: ?a? ? ????? t? ?d???? ?a??? t? d? d??a??? ?a??? ????e?, ?? f?s?? ? ???t?? ?? t?

More extensive emendations to 16.3 are discussed by the author in Restoring Olympiodorus' Sylbgistic, Ancient Philosophy 17 (1997), 411-24. 17) See M. Sicherl, Ein neuplatonischer Hymnus unter den Gedichten Gregors von Nazumz, in: Gonimos, Neoplatonic and Byzantine Studies presented to L.G. Westerink (BufTalo 1988), who prefers the candidature of Ps-Dionysius to that of Proclus. Olympiodorus seems unaware of, or indifferent to, or reluctant to reveal, the hymn's true authorship. 18) In Asclepius, who argues intelligibly, it is clear that para is to be distinguished from memory by being more 'individual', while experience is more 'universal' than memory, and likewise than para. The 'individual' nature of para is confirmed by David, In Isag. 43.23-25 (cf. 47.18).</page><page sequence="7">OLYMPIODORUS ON PLATO'S GORGIAS 29 When the passage discusses types of striking confusion, then recorders and scribes too are likely to be confused, particularly if their background knowledge is insufficient. Although the text of the Phaedrus at 260a-b is (to us at least) of some help, Olympiodorus is too free in his use of it to make certain reconstruction possible. The original talks of the possibility of calling what is in fact an ass a horse, and claiming that it is very good at the tasks which a horse is used for. The commentator is claiming that Plato talks of one who says 'The horse proves itself a horse (is evident as a horse) when it has the tasks which are (in reality) those of the ass, and vice-versa.' Regardless of the exact meaning, it seems that ?a? ? ???? ?pp?? ???a ??e? is meant to stand for ?a? ? ???? fa??eta? ???? ?pe?

It is true that Olympiodorus is discussing an oath 'By Hera', who is associated with pure rational soul, and swearing by a particular di- vinity can easily be seen as an attempt to seek to please it, but (i) Olympiodorus is here trying to explain away the anthropomorphic divinities, a task which would have been undermined by any sugges- tion that what Hera stood for could be won over by our oaths, and (ii) cutting out the irrational passions has already introduced the notion of the separation of rational psychical life from the irrational; Olympiodorus is more likely to be amplifying this point than intro- ducing a new one.

(?. 63.15-16) Olympiodorus is answering the problem that Plato refuses to regard as an orator any who is involved with injustice, but nobody denies the title of 'doctor' to one who transgresses his oath and administers destructive drugs. The answer appears to be that there is a higher good than that which the doctor aims at, but nothing higher than that which the orator is supposed to aim at. The pre- sent text might seem to deny vigorously that the doctor is concerned with the soul. It would be more satisfactory if the doctor were seen as occasionally overlooking the good of the body in the interests of a higher good. It seems that Olympiodorus knows Galen's work That the Faculties of the Soul follow the Mixtures of the Body (49.6, p. 261.11- 12), although he does not agree that this has to be the case. Still, he can scarcely have thought that doctors either always do ignore the soul, or that this ought to be the case, particularly when one bears in mind that Platonists not fortunate enough to occupy a 'chair' in late antiquity might naturally have turned to medicine for an in- come20). Furthermore, it does not help his case that doctors should have no concern for the whole?all that is needed is agreement that qua doctors their professed concern (and that of their oath) is with the body.

There are some twenty other uses of ?? p??t?? in Olympio- dorus, eight in the Aristotelian commentaries, one in In Ale, seven more in In Grg., and four in In Phd. In the Aristotelian works only In Mete. 285.3 follows the phrase with d?, though In Cat. 50.29, 58.32, and 106.5 have it follow d? and In Mete. 157.4 has it follow ???a.

(1.14, and 5.6 three times), while it once follows ?a? ??? (21.8). It can thus be said that Olympiodorus' favourite use of the phrase is when saying T, but not necessarily Q\ This confirms the emendation. 12.1: When Polus said 'Tell me, Socrates, what is rhetoric?', [So- crates] supplemented one question with another (462b6), and said that it is not a craft.

I believe this to be unnecessary, since the fuller account at 11.13 is given in the course of discussing this very pas- sage. Here at 12.1, however, additional brevity is to be expected, since this is recapitulation of a passage already dealt with in the pre- vious lecture. Strictly speaking, lecture 12 begins at 462bll. 12.10: ?????? d? ?st?? ? ??t????? ??de??? t?? ?a???, a?s??? ??? ?st?? (?. 75.26-27) Here the received text, whether or not the first sentence here is placed in inverted commas and related to Socrates' words at 463a2- 4, agrees very poorly with Olympiodorus' own conviction that there can be a higher rhetoric (1.13 etc.), and just as poorly with his own preceding account of Socrates' acceptance that Gorgias' rhetoric might be something rather different. What is needed here is ?????? d? ?st? t?? ??t?????, though one hesitates to affirm that this is quite what Olympiodorus said.

It is Proclus' theory that absolute evil does not exist as evil must partake of good in order to have any existence (In Prm. 835.14-19), and Olympiodorus does try to convince us that it is only our own inadequate knowledge which leads us to assume that there is injus- tice in the world (17.2, 19.3). But an unequivocal denial of the real- ity of evil is still unexpected. In order to be arriving at this conclu- sion Olympiodorus must be assuming the truth of an unstated pre- mise: that anything in existence must either be an end or a means, so that evil, being neither, does not exist. The whole passage is in fact about means and ends, and has nothing to do with existence and non-existence. It is therefore preferable to read what is the natural concluson to the argument: ?ste ??d?&lt;te???&gt; ?st? t? ?a???. That this should be the conclusion is virtually guaranteed by the fact that the argument began as a justification of the statement (p. 94.6-7): t? d? ?a??? ??d? e?e?? t?? ??d? ?? ??e?a. 17.1: t? ???; s? t????t?? e? ???? ?e?e?e?? ???e??; (?. 95.24-25) The discussion concerns the tactic of suggesting that one's oppo- nent in discussion is in fact no different from others. One requires the Greek to be saying 'Are you as good as you want others to be?'

(?. 99.3-5) Mastering statues is a curious notion, and unrelated to the proce- dures of mastering thirst which follow. The statues theme would seem to require an aorist participle and an imperative, as the thirst theme does. Fortunately we have Epictetus' relevant text (Man. 47). He is advising the pupil not to make an open display of his hardiness by embracing snow-covered statues as Diogenes of Sinope is said to have done (D.L. 6.23), but to toughen himself up away from the public eye. It is by no means obvious that ??at?sa? t??? a?d????ta? could mean 'controlling the impulse to embrace statues'. Perhaps, therefore, one should postulate a lacuna, and tentatively read ?s??- sa? &lt;?? pe??????a?e&gt; t??? a?d????ta?, which would relate closely to the text of Epictetus. 18.3: ? ????? ?at e????e?a? f?s?? ?t? ?????? ?st?? ??t?? ?at? s?? ?a? ??? e?da???? t?s??t?? a????e??, (?. 105.1-2)</page><page sequence="11">OLYMPIODORUS ON PLATO'S GORGIAS 33 What Polus is ironically22) emphasizing in Plato's text (47led) is the broad agreement that Archelaus is blessed.

There are five reasons for assuming a lacuna here: (i) Olympiodorus' text refers only to laws here, dropping pursuits; (ii) it would be charac- teristic of Olympiodorus to want to give some reason why Plato often refers to laws and pursuits as if they were related but distinct concepts; (iii) Olympiodorus fails to show how laws and pursuits can be both aesthetically and practically 'fine'; (iv) p??e? ta ?a???ata is an odd expression for doing mathematics; (v) it seems odd to say (rough- ly): 'the soul does mathematics, for these benefit the soul\ 21.5: Hence committing injustice is harmful, what is harmful is worse, and therefore injustice is bad too. (p. 118.2-3) It seems clear that the argument requires 'bad' for 'worse', hence read ?a??? rather than ??????, which is presumably a copyist's error. 24.3: Those who do not go wrong at all are gods, ... (p. 131.5-6) Here Westerink has emended the MS reading ?e??? in favour of ?e??. Though this is in agreement with the marginal note, it cannot easily be reconciled with the partitive genitive t?? a????p?? at 131.1, and ignores the fact that Olympiodorus was saying there 'of humans, some go wrong, while others do not.' The emendation must there- fore be rejected. 27.8: t? d? ???? ????a ?????e? ?p? t?? ?a?a???, ? ??? ???a? t??.

(?. 151.12-13) This is a puzzling text about what is itself a disputed point of Pla- to's text. If we follow Dodds at 49Id then we should probably read ?&lt;t?&gt; 't?? t?' a?t? t?? ???e?? or ?&lt;t?&gt; 't??'? t??t? ??t? t?? ???e??. However if Olympiodorus is really explaining something as ???e?? then we need something which could have been thought to have been a verb of saying. Hence we could read ?&lt;t?&gt; 't? ?'? t??t? a?t? t?? ???e??. Olympiodorus would be finding an unusual use of the verb ???, and interpreting the question as 'What did he say?'. I hope to say more about the text at 49 Id, and the readings of the scholiast and Olympiodorus, elsewhere. 30.11: ... he is declaring his view: 'So that I shall be inconsistent24), I say that 'pleasant' and 'good' are the same thing.' (p. 158.11-12) This follows the reading of the original hand, ????. I do not un- derstand Westerink's preference for the corrector's ?????: 'So that I shall be inconsistent by saying that 'pleasant' and 'good' are the same thing.5 Olympiodorus' ta?t?? ???? ?d? ?a? a?a??? is simply rewording Plato's t? a?t? f??? e??a?. 30.11 : e?? ta?ta ?e f??e??, f?s??, ? S???ate?, ??a ?? ???????s? ta?- t?? ?d? ?a? a?a??? (?. 158.13-15) As Westerink punctuates, Callicles would be trying to say: 'You are bringing me to this in order that I shall not agree that pleasure and the good are the same', making the verb 'agree' inappropriate, and the purpose clause of 495a5 either dependent on 494e9 or unre- lated to the rest of 495a5-6. Neither would be tolerable. There must be stronger punctuation after the implication that Socrates is doing the leading, which can be explained as a way of indicating that Cal- licles is now under pressure to agree with Socrates. And an indepen- dent clause must be found in ta?t?? ?d? ?a? a?a???, which once again seems to relate to 495a6: t? a?t? f??? e??a?. Perhaps read: e?? ta?ta ?e f??e??, f?s??, ? S???ate?? '??a ?? ???????s?, ta?t?? ?d? f??? ?a? a?a???, f??? is not, however, necessary. Olympiodorus would then be interpreting Callicles as saying in this case: 'So that my ac- 24) Burnet reads ?? ???????????e???, but Olympiodorus knew only ?? ?????????e??? and ???????????e???.

This passage, which concerns Euclid's common notions 1 and 2, is far from easy. 'You will make the same things equal' sounds non- sense. Preferable therefore is: ta &lt;t? a?tf ?sa&gt; a?t? ?sa. Two sepa- rate additions of 10 and 5 will both equal 15: they will also be equal to each other. 35.1: ?p?t?tt??t??

(p. 179.23-24) The Greek has ?t? t?? d??a??? ep?st???? ????? ???e? e??a? ? ??t??. It makes no sense to include ????? here. Olympiodorus is com- menting on 508b-c where Plato has no corresponding term. The text has been corrupted from t?? d??a??? ????? three lines below. 37.1: de? ??? ?a? d??as?a? ** ?????ta e??a? ? ?????t?? f????. (?. 189. 19-20) ?a? ? would seem to be enough to fill Westerink's lacuna: 'Hence one must (i) have power, and (ii) either be a ruler or the friend of a ruler.' d????e?a was used absolutely at p. 189.18. 37.1: Westerink's apparatus suggests ? for ? at p. 190.1, giving the sense: 'And he should either possess [the craft] himself, ..., or ... he should learn it from one who does.' Knowing oneselfand being an assistant able to take instructions are regularly distinguished in this commentary, often with reference to the doctor and the apothecary (1.13, 2.4, 32.3-4, 42.1). 38.4: ??e?? d? oi ??????? ?a? ??a?t????e? ?a? t???????e?a ?? ?et? ????? ?ataf????sa?te? ?a? p???a?te? ?a???,... (?. 196.4-6) Olympiodorus is explaining how that which possesses and uses reason (like rhetoric) should be held accountable for its unreasoning conduct, so that humans are accountable but not animals. It may therefore be desirable to read ?? ?et? ????? &lt;?????&gt; ?ataf??- ??sa?te? or ?? ?et? ????? ?a?? f????sa?te?. 39.1: At ?. 197.29 there seems to be no reason to read the subjunc- tive ?p????s???e? rather than ?p????s???e? here in view of the reg- ular confusion of omega and omicron in this text. 42.2: ? s??t?de???. ?tt???te??? t? s??t?de???, epe?d? ta s???a, ? ?st? ta ?e??? s??ata ?a? d???ata, e???ta?.

It seems preferable to adopt Westerink's suggested ??, de? de e?ta??a ?a?- ???e?? ..., given in the apparatus. 49.3: It is perhaps better at p. 259.22 to read ?? tf ?eta?? t?p? ?at- ????ta? with Beutler (implying no motion through the middle realm) rather than ?at?????ta?, which is retained by Westerink. The possi- ble directions at the crossroads of the underworld would more logi- cally be up, down, and level, rather than up, down, and a litde bit down.

The term ?p????s?? would, if correct, embrace the twin concepts of reversion and consciousness (of right and wrong) in any case. Though the term is not found elsewhere in Olympiodorus, nor in Ammonius, Elias, David, or Damascius, it occurs often in Philo- ponus and once in Stephanus for cognition which uses lower, sense- based observation to lead us towards an understanding of higher non-sensible reality, in these cases of the divine25). Simplicius at another point uses the term for cognition of the principles which have no other principles before them26). 25) Philop. Opif 18.22, 27.9, 58.26, 132.28, 274.14, 295.15; Simpl. In Phys.

However, this is principally because of the very high initial rate of mistakes involving the failure to distin- guish between omega and omicron. This problem seems to have been rectified very early, so that it seems that the lecturer was mak- ing some distinction between these sounds, even though it required experience to interpret this correcdy. Problems over the proximity of iota, epsilon-iota, and eta remain, and probably indicate the virtual disappearance of any distinction between these sounds within the 28) There is also the possibility that one should read t? for tf twice at 13.1 (p. 77.10 Westerink).</page><page sequence="18">40 HAROLD TARRANT school.
