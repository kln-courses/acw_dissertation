      <p>Taking a different look at the biological world seems to be A. K. Dewdney's intent in <italic>Hungry Hollow: The Story of a Natural Place</italic>, an episodic tale that combines elements of fiction with nonfictional scientific information. According to the author, Hungry Hollow is a natural place that is representative of any natural area in the deciduous forest zone of eastern North America. Dewdney structures his story around the inhabitants of this area; they include everything from an atom, to a bacterium, to a raccoon, to a human being. In each chapter, the reader not only learns a great deal about the biology of these organisms, but also is brought down to their level via Dewdney's fictionalized account of their existence, for which he employs the techniques of anthropomorphism and fable.</p>
      <p>Although the reader experiences a different look at nature through the eyes of several characters, it is the experience of “Dianne sapiens” that is most compelling and that reflects the theme of the book. Having lost her job teaching biology at a university, Dianne returns to her home, which is situated near Hungry Hollow, and begins to look at her world differently: “Although she does not realize it yet, her life has been opening up, and when she walks the Hollow, it is like a new world. She pays attention…. As she disengages her self-image from the world of academe, she reviews the ideas she once accepted without a thought and finds them wanting” (p. 19).</p>
      <p>In using the term “wanting,” Dianne conveys the inability of biological terminology to capture the aesthetic and almost spiritual side of living things and systems. In fact, Dianne's struggle reflects the age-old conflict between sight and blindness: those with sight are often the most blinded to the truth of what is occurring around them. Dewdney again expresses this theme through Dianne's thoughts as she stares into Hungry Creek: “She wants to see it as clearly as she sees the plants and insects around her. What microscopes have revealed they have also made abstract and unreal” (p. 49).</p>
      <p>Dianne is eventually able to “see” other worlds by shrinking in a fashion similar to Alice in Wonderland. In chapter 7, Dewdney sets up the first 5 of his 10 worlds, each of which is one-tenth the size of the previous. World One is measured in decimeters, World Six in micrometers, and World Ten at the level of individual atoms. Dianne herself is able to “experience” five of these worlds, eventually ending up 17 micrometers tall, able to interact with bacteria.</p>
      <p>Although this discussion is intriguing, Dewdney could have spent a bit more time in each of the worlds, using Dianne as a medium through which to translate and explore the life forms found there. Instead, he mentions these worlds only a few more times in the text, choosing rather to explore the biology of the organisms in the hollow. Although all of the organisms discussed in the chapters certainly fit into one of Dewdney's worlds, the connection is not explicitly made and expanded on as in chapter 7, which leads to my only complaint with the book—its lack of a central focal point. Certainly, the main characters, Dianne and Lotor the raccoon, provide some focus, but they do not appear in all of the chapters. Each chapter introduces the reader to a new organism and a new mini-plot, which gives the book a disjointed feel. The fact that all of these episodes occur in Hungry Hollow itself does provide some sort of unifying theme, but the detailed explanations and scientific information in each new episode often has the effect of obscuring a continuous narrative.</p>
      <p>Despite this slight criticism, it is still fascinating for the reader to share in the experiences and thoughts of the numerous characters, including Rana the frog, Virginia the possum, and an unnamed snapping turtle. The animals, organisms, and plants in the book operate simultaneously at fictional, literal, and symbolic levels. Dewdney's main intent is to discuss the natural history and biology of the organisms that inhabit the fictional Hungry Hollow. However, the hollow and the living things within it also take on symbolic meaning. For instance, the fact that a snapping turtle's back literally supports a variety of organisms is described in great detail, but Dewdney is also interested in the turtle's symbolic role as a supporter of all life, a role also found in Native American creation stories (chapter 10). Similarly, the hackberry tree (chapters 4 and 5) is not just a literal tree, but the figurative “Tree of Life,” whose branches “portray the relationships among living things” starting with the trunk, representing life, and extending into the five main branches, representing the five kingdoms.</p>
      <p>However, although this symbolic and spiritualized look at living things seems celebratory, there is a sense that all is not well in Hungry Hollow. It seems to be a thriving place, but in fact, as a “microcosm of Earth,” the hollow has problems that are typical of all ecosystems. The “Congress of the Birds” (chapter 6) hints at humans' role in environmental degradation. Anthropomorphizing the birds (as he does for several of the animal characters in the book), Dewdney uses them as a mouthpiece for his anger at the destruction of natural things. Humans are on trial at this congress, and the charges are “genocide and the destruction of natural property,” as made by the downy woodpecker whose habitat was destroyed by the development encroaching on Hungry Hollow. The red-tailed hawk, stuttering because chemicals have damaged his nervous system, also charges humans with genocide. The birds' caustic discussion of humanity concludes with a disturbing story of two boys killing a turtle out of spite. This congress is a good example of Dewdney's mission to prompt the reader to look at things in a different perspective, through someone or something else's eyes. For instance, one can't help but feel the rebuke in the mourning dove's speech:
<disp-quote>
            <p>The air [in the city] smells like smoke and oil, there is great noise at all times, and the humans, because they have nothing real to do, are unhappy. They wish to avoid pain at all costs and so do not exert themselves over anything. Their knowledge declines with every generation, and their ignorance is rampant. They think they are free, but they are the greatest slaves that ever were. Pleasure is their master. They imagine that so long as the impulse originates in them, it expresses their freedom. What irony. What supreme irony! (p. 46)</p>
         </disp-quote>
Thinking that they are reading an entertaining story about a different place, how surprised readers will be when forced to examine that inner place of conscience, choice, and culpability! Like other natural areas on Earth, Hungry Hollow faces the threat of bulldozers and new housing developments. Luckily, however, it narrowly escapes this fate when Dianne discovers Native American remains, thus making it a protected natural place—for the time being.</p>
      <p>Like the narrative itself, Hungry Hollow the place can be appreciated at multiple levels—literal, symbolic, spiritual, microscopic, and cosmic. Dewdney takes the reader right into the midst of it all, portraying living things and their interactions with numerous details. He urges the reader to cease taking these living things for granted or categorizing them as mere scientific facts—the real challenge is to step back from the microscope and appreciate nature from different, and often surprising, perspectives.</p>
