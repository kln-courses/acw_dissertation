<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ol 109 THE PAINTINGS IN THE PALACE OF ASFRASIAB (SAMARKAND) At the turn of the century, when V.L. Vjatkin undertook the first inve- stigations into the ruins of Samarkand ' the past of this city already belonged to a legend which writers, travellers and poets had played a part in shaping. And, although the scinstillating cupolas and the colored bricks of her mosques and madrasas attested the opulence of islamic Samarkand, the previous period - known somewhat by way of literary sources - was bereft of adeguate documentation. Thus, the laudable efforts of Vjatkin, but above all the systematic exca- vations which got under way following the Second World War, still ongoing, have gone a long way towards bridging this gap 2 . As a matter of fact, that which at one time was known as 'the fortress of Afrasiab', but which turned out to be a very extensive and ancient city, has been unearthed on the hill north of Samarkand 3. 1 V.L.

Moreover V.L. Vjatkin writes that the term appears in the written sources only from the end of the 17th century. V.A. Livšic thinks it possible that the name of the city derives from the Tajik «ParsTãb» (Sogdian:Parsvãb) «Above the black river», i.e. the Síãhãb or Sïâb; the latter, actualy, is the name given to the canal running on the northern side of the town.</page><page sequence="2">110 Chiara Silvi Antonini [2} . Afrasiab appears roughly as a triangular-shaped town, surrounded on the northern side by a man-made canal, the Siab, within four sets of walls marking of the subsequent period of building to be found in the area. The phase to be dealt with, in this short paper, is the medieval one, i.e. the period to which belong the wall paintings of room 1 of the royal palace, situated within the third set of walls (excavation 23). Said walls differ marke- dly from the others in that, being built sout;h of the second set, they run only a short distance parallel to it, ending in a circle, on both sides of a supposed door entrance. While not expatiating in the intricate question of dating of the walls 4, we shall stick to the theory posited by L.I. Al'baum 5 according to which the new rulers of Samarkand, in the 7th century, were to have built their residences and the Palace in the center of the city, which existed previously, and have then surrounded them by walls. In 1963 a wall embellished with paintings was unearthed, but it was not until 1965 that a decision was made to begin systematic excavations in the area, especially in the rooms of the extensive palace complex. Two of the palace chambers which were uncovered revealed important frescoes on the walls, i.e. rooms 1 and 9. Room 1, with which we shall be concerned, is a large square room, 11 meters lenghtwise, whose walls are built of pachsa blocks, preserved to the height of 2.7 m. on the west and north sides, 2.5 m. on the south and a height ranging from 1 to 2 m. on the east side. At the base of the wall, is a clay bench which runs around all four walls with a short projection at the center of the western wall. Specialists have long been acquainted with the paintings in room 1 of Afrasiab, for L.I.Al'baum devoted an entire volume to it 6 and because the paintings figure rather often in western publications dealing with Central Asian paintings 7. It may be worthwhile, however, to review briefly the subjects of the scenes depicted, for the purpose of attempting a more complete reading. On the western wall, situated opposite the room's door entrance, there is the scene called «of the ambassadors», which comprises 42 figures painted on two superimposed registers. On the lower one, the first two figures to the left are shown seated, but they are so poorly preserved to dismiss any positive iden- tification. There follow three personages wearing preciously adorned kaftans, 4 M.K.

They are earring gifts in their hands: a necklace and rosary, a roll of fabric and jewelry. At this juncture, there is a large gap in the wall due to the excavation of a well, performed in the tenth century. Beyond the gap are two figures dressed in a kaftan of a single color, i.e. respectively light yellow and red, with double lapels of decorate cloth. They are earring weapons in their belts and handkerchiefs wowen of precious material. Their hair is long and black, covering the shoulders and reaching down as far as the belt. The manner of dress and hairstyle show the figures to be members of the ruler of Samar- kand's suite. These two figures end the decoration of the first wall segment on the southern side. To the right of the above images, is the depiction of another retinue which runs leftward and is made up of five figures whose peculiar headdress reveals their provenance as being either China or East Turkestan. They also bears gifts in their hands. The next group is composed of six intersecting figures which show how the author 'changed his mind'. Three of them, unfinished, judging by the clo- thery and headpieces seem to belong to the previous embassy and are moving leftward, the others are clad in the same manner as the members of the royal suite and project upwards in a cross-wise trajectory. There are two other members of the local nobility and, afterwards, three different embassies com- posed respectively of 1, 3 and 2 persons dressed differently. The second register is taken up by the notables of Samarkand wearing kaftans, equipped with swords and having long black hair ending in thin tresses. They are seated, legs crossed, on carpets; at several points the figures are opposite one another; however, most of them are shown backs turned. The sequence ends with two standing and two kneeling figures. On the far left and the far right of the wall, there are two extremely interesting pictorial sequences. The first is yet composed by two personages belonging to the ruler's suite, standing upright in the space between the lower and the upper register. One of the two, missing the whole upper part of the body, is clad in a white kaftan and is holding in one hand a short sword and in the other a polo stick, whereas a long sword hangs from his belt behind. Abside from the peculiar object identified as a polo stick (which should in actuality come as no surprise since the game is known to have been played in Central Asia and is documented in representational arts as far as the T'ang period Chi- na), this figure is of the utmost importance because on the garments is a long inscription which has been used to support the identification of the entire scene. There are actually two inscriptions: one consists of two horizontal lines in Bactrian cursive, the other of sixteen vertical lines in Sogdian cursive. The</page><page sequence="4">112 Chiara Silvi Antonini [4] translation of the latter, performed by Livšic and published by Al'baum, reads as follows: «When the ruler Varxuman of the Unas dinasty approaches (the ambassador), (the ambassador) opens his mouth: I am the dapirpat of Caganian v (called) Pukar-zate. From the lord of Caganian Turantaš here in Samarkand, before the king as a sign of obeisance I bow down and remain here in a respectful attitude before the king. And thou (o king) entertain no suspicion in my regard. Of the gods of Samarkand and also of the writing of Samarkand I am fully apprised, and I shall cause no harm to the ruler of Samarkand and dwell, o king, in full properity. And the king Varxuman (of the) Unas (dynasty) granted his leave. And (then) the dapirpat of Cac opened his mouth» 8. Thereafter we shall return to the meaning of this inscription but, for the time being, let it suffice to underscore the eccentric position of the figure on which it appears. At the end of the wall, on the northern side, there is a picture which, although obliterated towards the top, covers both registers. Eleven vertical poles driven into the ground are depicted and there are held by a horizontal device to which the poles are fastened together. Out of the middle pole there seem to protude outward two ribbons of red material. At the base of the picture there are five circles in which 'devilish' masks are depicted, that is male faces characteryzed by large ball-shaped eyes as well as large mouths from the sides of which extend two fangs, whereas the noses and eyebrows merge to form the trunk and the leafy branches of a wonderful tree. Nearby there are three clubs, two of which have a rectangular end whereas the third, of a round shape, contains a lion's mask. It is our opinion that Al'bum's interpretation of this composition, as a set of power's symbols, is correct. Al'baum underlines also that plumed poles appear in other points among the paintings in room 1, that is, on the same western wall in the upper register beside the lacuna (there are nine poles in this case, of which only the lower part is preserved), as well as in the hands of two of the important personages riding on horseback in the procession of the southern wall. 8 I translated literally the russian text from the Al'baum's book (op. cit. p. 21). Let me quote now the english translation by R.N. Frye: The Significance of Greek and Yiushan Archaeology in the History of Central Asia , JAH, 1, 1967, pp. 33-44 «When the emissary of the Okhan? king (A)barkhuman, came, he opened his mouth (spoke), so, «I (am) the Chagani scribe, son of Bukar, from the Chagani ruler Tutanshah (?) here (and) to Samarkand in the presence of the king together with respect have come. Then (before) the king full of respect I shall (continue to) be present. And do not have any doubts (?) regarding me and the Samarkand gods. Then, at the same time, I am well informed about Samarkand writing, and also of the king's power (?). I have... well-wishing (at the same time) the Okhan king (A)barkhuman thus he opened his mouth the Chagani scribe».</page><page sequence="5">[5} The Paintings in the Palace of Afrasiab ( Samarkand) 113 Thus, the poles should be seen as banners held by or placed next to the major figures, the circles as shields, in which the masks would appear to take on an apotropaic role, the clubs as ruling staffs. The entire scene may well contain both military and civil import, and the choice made by the painter to represent nine or eleven poles, five shields and three clubs may likewise not be a matter of mere chance but rather relate to the numer of districts, provinces, cities or armies under the ruler's jurisdiction. The southern wall is embellished with an entirely different type of pro- cession, whose meaning also differs from that mentioned above. Once again the- re are superimposed registers, but the upper segment has deteriorated to such an extent that all attempts aiming at reconstruction have but pointed to the likelihood that the central part once showed marching horses. The lower re- gister, beginning with the eastern side, shows a pavilion with four standing figures. Of these figures, as also of the pavilion, only the lower area is preserved, which attests to the preciousness of the attire. From right to left, the procession approaches the figures, the former beginning with an elephant decked out luxuriously. The upper area has not been preserved, but Al'baum felt it contain- ed the portrayal of a canopy, under which was to have been a princess. At the end of the elephant's back, several unobliterated lines have led the scholar to believe there may have been a maid-servant. These are followed by three horsewomen, then two camels straddled by male figures wearing plain-color kaftans, with embroidered hems, jewelry, weapons and a white ribbon holding back the hair on the forehead. In one hand they bear, as though it were a sceptre, a short club ending in what appears to be a crocodile with an egg (?) in its jaws. The following sequence is particularly noteworthy. The first figure is a male personage dressed the way as the previous two horsemen. He has a mouth-covering (padhãm) and is moving to the left ahead of a richly-draped horse of whome he seems to be in charge. Above are four white birds followed by a youth also wearing a padhãm. The figure of the youth is incomplete although he would appear to be in a kneeling position. As for the white long- necked, thin-legged animals, they have been interpreted differently. V.A. Siskin believed them to be swans, V.A. Livšic read words on their bodies meaning 'foot', 'ducks' and 'four ducks to the king Vargoman (of the Unas dynasty)'. It was the feeling of Al'baum that these were ostriches. The question, admittedly, is not one of vital importance. I feel it is the case to again drawn attention to the fact that the animals are led by high-ranging personages wearing a mask above the mouth. For this reason I mantain that Siskin is cor- rect in stating the animals were linked to some formal cult 9. 9 V.A. Siškin, op. cit., p. 16.</page><page sequence="6">114 Chiara Silvi Antonini [6} The following figure, displaying a richly decorated kaftan and riding a yellow horse, has been termed by Al'baum «the head of the embassy» 10. His position of pre-eminence is due primarily to size, which is roughly twice that of the other figures in the procession; his rich attire, leopard-skin bow case and horse with ribbons at the hocks, are all designed to further underscore this figure's importance. V.A. Siskin, observing that the preserved part of the figure reached the height of two meters, infers that the horseman must have extended up the wall to the height of four meters and that, consequently, the depiction must have been of either a ruler or some prince of the ruling dynasty n. There follow two other horsemen wearing embroidered kaftans. Only one of these is sufficiently well preserved to allow a reconstruction of the figure's position, i.e. a side view with back turned, the bow case on the left side and plumed pole grasped in the right hand. Behind them there were likely three other horsemen, but all that is left is the blue snout of a horse and the red leg of another one. The northern wall is in a very poor shape. Only the lower part is preser- ved. On the east side of the wall a hunting scene is shown in which horsemen armed with spears and arrows are pitted against leopards which they are in process of fending off. Upon examining the extant fragments, it may be noted that the first rider is of a larger size than the other, but that all are wearing kaftans and riding boots, a black headpiece with two ribbons moving behind and that at their side they are carrying quivers and spear-sheaths. The last horse in the picture comes to a halt on the banks of a river, crowded by other personages; the first, in a squating position, is shown adju- sting a rectangular-shaped object (a bundle of cloth? or a shield?), whereas the second is putting on a ridingboot and a thrid is about to enter the water. In the water, there are two red boats, the first of which, poorly preserved, is occupied by men, while the second bears a group of maidens, the boat's bow being shap- ed like an animal. The ten female figure inside the vessel are divided in two groups on each side of the central figure, depicted in a standing position and appearing to be the main character of the scene; to the right of the latter are four figures and on her left, five others holding stringed musical instruments and a oar of the boat. The water on which the boat sails is strewn with lotus flower, plant-like forms and a great number of animals. The eastern wall is divided into two parts by the entrance-door, and it is the most poorly preserved of all walls. On the southern side is a painting of an aquatic scene. The water is represented by series of blue swirls and there are 10 L.I. Al'baum, op. cit., p. 48. 11 V.A. Siškin, op. cit., p. 18.</page><page sequence="7">[7} The Paintings in the Palace of Afrasiab ( Samarkand) 115 five figures. The first one is shown in a kneeling position, whereas the second looks as though he is allowing himself to be dragged into the wawes while being attached to the tail of an animal. These are followed by three children who, depicted in a cupid-like pose, are shooting arrows from tautlydrawn bows. Various animals may be distinguished in the water: fishes, a tortoise, and some ducks. The next scene begins with three birds in flight, of which only a few outlines are preserverd; they have been identified as starks. A seated figure follows, presumably female because a child is held in the lap; on the child's torso is some writing in Sogdian. Above the birds, are the legs of an animal and the feet of a man. On the northern part of the wall one encounters the figure of a man seated on a plinth, shown rolling a ball toward a youth kneeling in front of him. To the side is a rider staddling a black horse moving to the left. As stated previously, the Afriasiab paintings were studied by Al'baum. In a brief article, belonging to a miscellaneous collection devoted to Central Asia, printed in 1971 12, there is a description of the southern wall as well as of a sec- tion of the western one. Concerning the latter, Al'baum writes: «... it may be concluded that the paintings on the wall represent the embassy coming from Caganian... The embassy is bringing the ruler of Samarkand a princess along with precious gifts» 13. Further on, with regard to overall view of said paintings, Al'baum goes on to state: «... it may be assumed that the palace paintings depict the proclamation of Vargoman as regent (ikhshid) of Sogdiana» 14 . Subsequently, in the book published at the time when all the walls in the room had been fully excavated 15 , the Soviet scholar suggests as an interpretation of the Afrasiab paintings the reminescence of an actual historical occurence, i.e. the arrival in Samarkand of several embassies from a number of countries bearing gifts for the ruler Vargoman. The author has further delved into both the political and military situation of West Turkestan during the mid 7th century and the relations between the khanate of the Western Turks and the lords of the various regions, in particular that of Sogdiana. In the interim, the works of Smirnova 16 have been published, which tend to corroborate the idea that it was indeed Vargoman who was honored with being proclaimed regent of Sogdiana after having been merely lord (afshin) of Samarkand. Nevertheless 12 L.I. Al'baum, Novye Rospisi Afrasiaba , in 'Strany i národy Vostoka', Moskow, 1971, pp. 83-89. 13 ìbidem . n. 86. 7J__ 14 ìbidem, d. 89. 7 r -, 15 L.I.

The latter is spoken of by the author as a princess who was also being brought by the ambassadors as a gift to the ruler. It is also pointed out that the gesture performed by one of the maidens alludes to «nuptial talk» 17 . The author never explicitly states his conclusions, thus leaving one with the impression that the scholar s interests were directed rather towards Wealia, i.e. towards the eventuality of detecting the several ethnic groups represented and pointing out the role of pre-emince the city of Samar- kand played at that time as the hub of caravan routes crossing through Central Asia on the way to China. Indeed, this highlights the city's commercial, diplo- matic and also cultural role, if it is true, as it doubtless is, that the Sogdian school was one of the leading schools of painting of the day, its influence extendings outward as far as the extreme border of the Taklamakan desert. In recent years, a different interpretation has been suggested by the Soviet scholars A.M. Belenickij and B.I. Maršak 18 regarding the scene depicted on the western wall; looking to the latest findings in Pjandzikent as a point of depar- ture, these scholars conjecture that the missing figure is not the ruler on his throne but rather the female divinity whose cult enjoyed a broad following in the Sogdian area. The female divinity referred to is held to be the same one depicted in the northern chapel of Temple II in Pjandzikent, accompained by donors. The frequency with which this image recours in Pjandzikent and elsewhere would appear to substantiate Marsak's claim whereby the figure is posited as a city goddess, warranter of the ideology of the polis , of its laws and existing social order. Thus, Belenickij and Maršak point out that the inscription containing the Caganian ambassador's speach mentions the fact that the ruler Vargoman «ap- proaches him»: therefore Vargoman is not seated on the throne and the fo- reigners has come to reassure the sovereign of the willingness of the governing authorities of the nearby regions to respect the gods and the culture of Samar- kand. Indeed, the embassy has come bringing gifts to the god and not bringing harm to the city. Finally, the authors refer to an account provided by V.A. Livšic regarding the interpretation for the writing on the neck and forehead of two figures on the western wall identified as Caganian ambassadors. One may read, albeit somewhat doubtfully, on the first, the name 'Vargoman' and on the 17 L.I. Al'baum, op. cit., Taškent, 1975, p. 73. 18 A.M. Belenickij and B.I.

From this it would appear that the ruler himself was among those offering gifts to the god. Lastly, the scenes depicted on the other walls should be considered independent one from another and in no way related to the main scene. Thus, on the southern wall a marriage is said to be portrayed, but since the figures in the procession are moving in a direction opposite the ambassadors, the two events appear to be unrelated. The northern and eastern walls are said to show scenes of life from other countries. As for the two theories discussed so far, it is basically the opinion of the present writer that Al'baum is correct in maintaining that the ruler may be viewed as the centerpiece to the scene. It is my felling that, in effect, the theme of the scenes portrayed at Afrasiab could be that of ambassadors bringing gifts to the ruler. Nevertheless, in my opinion, the underlying motivations behind this event requires greater in-depth analysis. As regard the theory of Belenickij and Maršak, there is little room for doubt that at the present state of research, the supposition concerning the presence of a 'Sogdian goddess' in a place as important as Afrasiab now deserves serious attention, for recent excavations in Pjandzikent have shown that the cult of the goddess was widespread in the area and is also substantiated by a similar scenario in Bactriana and Margiana 19. There are, however, several objections which have to be raised to this theory. The first one is that it accounts for only one of the scenes in the room, which compels the authors to view the others as unrelated to the 'story' itself. Moreover, it appears oddly enough that there were no links among the scenes depicted in the same room. The fact becomes even odder if, indeed, one is dealing not with just a dwelling, but with an actual palace. A second objection concerns the way the Sogdian inscription has been interpreted. For indeed, even though the inscription reads: «When the ruler... approaches the ambassador...» there is no reason to assume this refers precisely to the time the ceremony portrayed on the wall was being held. As a matter of fact, upon closer analysis there is good reason to believe that the inscription - even if it were made at the same time as the paintings - might well be contextually different, i.e. that it was the work not of the painter, but of others, in an attempt to facilitate the reading of the pictorial cycle by relating one stage of the event. This idea gains plausibility if one con- siders that the anonimous annotator places his gloss in the margin, on an unde- rrated surface, i.e. the white kaftan of the Sogdian dignitary. If the inscription 19 G.

Consequently, even if we admit the possibility that there had actually been a conversation between Vargoman and the ambassador of Caganian, nothing prevents us from believing this occur- rence may have transpired prior to or following the time when the gifts had been delivered. Equally dubious, to my way of thinking, is the would be identification of figure 4 on the western wall as that of Vargoman. In fact, aside from the uncer- tainty surrounding the reading of the name and the absence of a crown or other feature distinctive of royalty, it is difficult to understand why the king Vargo- man had been represented in the company of the Caganian ambassadors. Also to be taken into consideration is the fact that, on the upper register of the same wall, the local dignitaries are shown seated on carpets, in the act of conversing among themselves or engaging in some other activities unrelated to delivering gifts or cultic rites. Finally, although it is well known that in Pjandžikent an oft-recurring image is that of a divinity seated on the throne and that in Sog- diana the temple was used also for non-religious ceremonies, it is also known that in the Afrasiab palace there is a room (no. 9), where the pictures of two di- vinities are portrayed which would provide strong proof that, if anything, this room should rightfully be considered the temple of the royal complex. By way of general premise, the present writer is aware that the first major problem, facing those attempting to decode the above paintings, is the disap- pearance of the figure occupying the middle area of the western wall: a figure that was to have been the central focus of the account related by the pictures. We have also to keep in mind, that this problem is an unsolvable one, because the character is lost for ever. Nevertheless it may be not completely useless to suggest my own reading of this pictorial sequence. In my opinion the paintings in room 1 of Afrasiab were intended to represent an enthronement scene held in cojuction with the New Year Festival, and all the scenes depicted on the four walls were designed to illustrate this very ceremony. I shall thus attempt to justify the reasons warranting a similar interpretation. The first reason for this, is because, in all likelihood, the event described did indeed occur in Samarkand during the rule of Vargoman and that the happening was of such import as to be deemed worthy of recording. Hence, the afshin of Samarkand, with the approval of the Turk khanate with whom, inci- dentally, the Sogdians were on close terms, had become the ikhshid of Sogdiana. At that time, then, was a normal occurrence for ambassadors from far and near to be bringing the ruler precious gifts. But what could possibly have been the</page><page sequence="11">[11] The Paintings in the Palace of Afrasiab ( Samarkand) 119 pretext' accounting for such a large-scale gathering? There are two plausibles explanations: marriage or royal accession. The path which has led me to opt for the second explanation began with the analysis of a segment of the southern wall on which male figures are shown with mouths covered and animals at their sides, respectively a horse and four ducks (?). As noted previously, Al'baum dilates on the identity of these marve- lous white animals - while glissing over the horse entirely - concluding that it must be a depiction of ostriches, because they, or rather their eggs, are often mentioned in the list of gifts brought to the ruler of the Celestial Empire by the ambassadors from various countries. Thus, these were gifts for the ruler of Samarkand. But why did these gifts require the presence of such peculiar personages as those represented on the southern wall? They can in no way be viewed as servants, as Al'baum does, for their attire is in keeping with the two figures riding the camels ahead of them and above all because they are wearing the padhãm. Thus, their presence is hardly a matter of chance, but rather is quite meaningful. For this reason it is important to grasp the role they play in the whole of the paintings, as it must again be stressed that considering them merely as bearers of offerings is an oversemplified interpretation. It seems proper to initiate the search for the iconographie matrix of this pictures in Persia, where similar figures appear in various contexts in the fra- mework of Sasanian figurative art with which the artists of Afrasiab were well acquainted, as may be deduced, for example, by the intricate decoration of attire, an effect obtained by repeatidly tracing pearl-like circles within which are inscribed the figures of winged horses, rams, peacocks and senmurv. Our search, however, will extend as far as Central Asia, for the purpose of under- lying the meaning of the iconographie image and finding out just how the transfer came about and what original meanings are retained, or what new ones taken on, with the spread of the Sasanian influence throughout those territories which came under its cultural sway. A spot check of the major studies devoted to Sasanian toreutics 20 allows us to single out several silver plates representing figures whose mouth are covered 20 Ja.I.

In Central Asia this type of iconography may be found, aside from Afrasiab, in a scene portrayed on the well-known Merv vase, on two ossuaries respectively from Mulla Kurgan and the district of Kaška Darya. Probably also in the paintings from Küh-i Hwãga and on two sculptures from Toprak-Kala. Male figures with a mouth-covering may be found in four types of scenes: 1) Banquet scenes. I shall cite two plates from this group which have often appeared in print 21 , with the ruler seated or half lying down on a couch with a heap of cushions at one end. The ruler is holding in one hand a cup and in the other a flower (?) and is surrounded by musicians and servants. The first of the two plates, currently preserved in the Hermitage Museum, shows, on the ruler's right-hand side, a man dressed in a long kaftan, with boots, padhãm and hands crossed over the chest. An identical figure also appears in the lower part of the scene earring out an operation described as the filtering of wine from what is likely to be a sack made of vegetable fibre, into an amphora. The other plate, on display at the British Museum, shows, to the left of the ruler, a female figure seated on a couch while standing to the right is a figure wearing a katfan and boots, arms crossed over the chest and mouth-covering. The band reach the top of the head extending to the back of the neck in two broad ribbons. The other two figures completing the scene are a lute and a horn (?) players. To the- se two plates I would like to odd a third, which figures in a display catalogue for an exibition held at the University of Michigan 22, where the royal banquet scene is representative, by large, of the customary iconography, aside from the fact that the figures to the king's left, otherwise completely similar to the others, are wearing a moustache and beard but no padhãm. 2) Funeral scenes. A magnificent example serving to illustrate this group is the ossuary unearthed in Mulla Kurgan 23 dating back to the 6th or 7th century. It is a funeral urn on the side of which are depicted three arcs. Beneath the arcs, in the middle, is a fire altar off to the sides of which are two priests with mouth-covering, kneeling at the altar.

The upper corner is taken up by solar and lunar symbols. The ossuary in Kaška Darya 24 is also higly interesting. It portrays an intricate scene divided into two registers. Mo- ving toward the right, on the upper register a male figure is seated with legs crossed, dressed in a double-lapel kaftan, holding against the thigh on his right hand, an object which may be a club-like sceptre. To this figure's right, there is another one shown kneeling toward him. Between these two, is a nude putto behind a ribbon whose outer edge appears to be held by the main characters. On the lefthand side are three more male figures, one of whom, in the middle, is seated upon a carpet holding in his hand two unidentifiable objects. Off to his sides are a harp and a lute player, shown kneeling and facing him. The lower register shows two rams back to back, a priest with padhãm and a horse approaching a four sided altar. Between the two scenes is an incense burner. As for the Merv vase, held to be an ossuary in scholarly literature, there is an unbroken string of figures depicted at a banquet, a scene of lamentation and a hunting scene. Under the handle, is a man with a mouth-covering and, behind him, a bird with long tail feather 25 . 3) Coronation scenes. As for this group, noteworthy is the fact that few extant examples are to be found among Sasanian toreutics 26 . Among surviving models, the only one showing a figure with which we shall be directly concer- ned is the silver plate from Qazvin. The figure (or rather figures, portrayed on the plate, for the right side - now missing - likely showed a figure identical to the one on the left side) is seen standing beside the throne on which the king is seated, arms crossed and mouth covered with padhãm. If the search for analogous forms of representational art is extended to other regions, two more sites may be included in this group: the palace com- plex located in Ghãga Sãhr and the Toprak-Kala palace. It is known that in the hall of the former there is the depiction of a proces- sion moving toward the king and the queen on their thrones. Along the nor- thern corridor of the court is the portrayal of a figure generally said to be a 'flutist', on account of the object which appears to be protruding out of the 24 N.I.

An in-depht analysis of this figure though has recently induced Dr Harper 28 to identify the object as a padhãm. This theory, in my opinion, is highly credible, for the band extends downward as far as the nape and the two loose ends, faintly visible behind the figure's neck and shoulders, were likely part of it. A similar scenario is encountered in Toprak-Kala. In the royal palace of the khwarezmian city in the 'Victory' room, the high-relief figures, embelli- shing the wall niches, have been construed by Tolstov as characters engaged in a scene of royal investiture, i.e. the king and queen flanked by two divinities. In the adjacent chamber, called the 'Warriors' room', two high-relief figures 29 have been preserved with an object over their mouth, on which ground they are held by Rapoport to be pipers, but by Grenet as «des guardes ou des serviteurs portant le padâm et executant le geste d'humilité requis en presence des souve- rains». F. Grenet goes on to contest there are religious connotations linked to this scene, reiterating «qu'on a affaire... à une composition évoquant la majesté royale» 30 . 4) Scenes portraying a priest before a fire altar. The Mulla Kurgan ossua- ry, as well as several Sasanian seals may be again included in the present group, even though they are in many cases faintly legible and therefore are not always reliable as revealing the presence of the padhãm. A case in point is in Gignoux's statement 31 concerning a «femme de profil à droite tenant un objet de culte (?) devant un autel du feu à flammes» 31 ; there is no mention made of the 'sign' over the mouth which, according to me, would appear to be the tell-tale band. The same scene (albeit this time one of a clearly legible male figure) may be found on the seal of the Marshall collection on display in the Peshawar Mu- seum 32 . From the above it may be concluded that the Afrasiab figures are priests about to perform a sacrifice and that the mouth-covering is to be construed as a homage vis-a-vis the ruler (e.g. the Qazvin plate) or as a ritual they are to presi- de over (e.g. Kaška Darya ossuary). 27 D.

It may also be added that there is no standardization among the five examples generally used as a basis for analysis. Hence, it appears unlikely the craftsman adhered to any pre-established iconographie pattern. Given that the question related to the enthronement scenes - that is, those concerning the type of throne used or the identity of the ruler - do not fall within the scope of the present paper, we shall not take them into consideration. Several of the plates, however, aside from the one with the king on the throne, bear depictions of other scenes of lesser importance but nonetheless closely associated with the main scene. Two examples may be cited in this regard: a plate from Střelka and the one preserved in the British Museum. The latter has been published by M. Carter, who has detected in the four figures portrayed in the central medallion an investiture scene of a vassal performed by the ruler (upper register) and two «members of the royal house somehow involved in the scene above yet not partecipating directly in it» 33. Around the edge of the plate, a banquet is shown with the ruler half-lying on a couch piled with layers of cushions. The ruler is holding a cup and a flower and is surrounded by five persons seated around him along with musicians and servants. The conclusion reached by Carter is that the scene deals with «aspects of a royal Sasanian New Year celebration, showing the apotheosized monarch installing an official of government and a drinking ceremony of the ruler in the midst of his court» 34 . The Střelka plate shows the ruler seated on his throne, hands resting on a sword standing upright between the outspread legs: gathe- red around the throne are four figures facing the king, arms crossed over the chest. Separating the upper and lower scene is a straight line. The lower part shows a hunting scene wherein the ruler on horseback is about to shoot an arrow from his bow at a ram attempting to escape. Thus, on the one hand, we find the investiture-banquet connection, on the other, that of the incoronation-hunt. Indeed, also the banquet scene may be connected with the hunt; that is what we can see in a plate belonging to the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, where the representational motif, altough merely symbolic, by way of three wild boars' heads, is reminiscent of the king's «successful hunt» which was to have occurred at an earlier time 35 . This recur- ring scenario again appears on the Merv vase which, in the above-mentioned 33 M. Carter, Royal Festal Themes in Sasanian Silverwork and their Central Asian Parallels , Acta Iranica, vol. I, Teheran-Lieee, 1974, dd. 171-201, specifically D. 178. 34 Ibidem , p. 188. 35 R. Ghirhman, Persian Art.

According to this American scholar, the various scenes depicted on the vase are in no way related to the funeral customs of Central Asian peoples but rather they are re- presentation of different moments of a New Year celebration. At this juncture the following question naturally arises: what kind of cere- mony was the one performed during the ruler's coronation, what were the ac- companying rites and meanings vis-a-vis the kings subjects? In a volume by R.S. Ellwood 36 devoted to royal coronation the world over, the reader is told that in Egypt this act took place at the outset of one of the three seasons and that in Japan, the Emperor, for the purpose of sealing his accession to the throne, ordered the celebration of harvest festivals (Djo-sai). In actuality, for many peoples of late antiquity, coronation is something of an palingenetical occurence, i.e. a string of rites performed so as to conjure up the timeless cycle of the death and rebirth of living things. G. Gnoli maintains that, in Iran, New Year celebration is «modellata sull'akltu babilonese di Nisãn, con la stessa esal- tazione della regalità dispensata e protetta dagli dei supremi» 37 . This concept has been reiterate by Ellwood; in fact, it fits with political expendiencies not only of powerful dynasties such as those in Babylon or Persia, but also the heads of lesser societies, nonetheless requiring the image of establishing order out of chaos, as a principle of rebirth in the plant kingdom, i.e. as no less than the source of all goodness. Said festivals envisaged, on the one hand, purification or liberation ceremonies (washing, anointings, war rituals) and on the other, the affirmation of the ruler's authority, i.e. the proskynesis , the regalia , the triumphant procession, the banquet and sacred marriage. Returning to the Iranian world, A. Christensen states that the ruler's coronation was performed during the first feast of Nowrõz following the accession to the throne 38. Let us now focus attention on the festive proceeding of Nowrõz. al-Blrünl expatiates on New Year festivals; his account begins by quoting a philosopher of the Hashwiyya school who relates that on the day Solomon, son of David, was restored to his Kingdom and «regained his former majesty, the princes came before him and the birds were busy in his service. Then the Persians said: Naurõz ãmadh, i.e. the new day has come» 39. So it is that the kingly power is related to Nowrõz. al-Bïrûnl then dilates on the 36 R.S.

If indeed under the Achaemenids the New Year Festival was the Mithrakãnã, which correspond to the Autumn equinox, then, during Sasanian times the Nowrõz was added to it, on occasion of spring equinox. Thus the Nowrõz held a more specific connotation regarding the renewal of plant life and this rebirth, in mythological terms, was linked to the exploits of Yima, the first king, who slays the dragon Azi Dãhãhã, thereby freeing the river waters, ending the drought and creating fertility. This fertility applies both to nature and man, for the hero weds the women freed from the clutches of the dragon. This account, handed down by Rivayãt Parsi, goes on to relate how, following the victory, the Hero-King takes his place upon the throne, surrounded by priests and no- blemen, crowning himself with the ruler's diadem, thereby being acknow- ledged as king. There are infortunatly no surviving literary works to provide scholars with detailed account of this festive occurrence. As stated by Widengren: «there are nevertheless great many allusions to it in literature and folklore, besides the exactly equivalent Indian festival as it can easily be recontructed from Rig Veda... We know further that the king's enthronement and his fight against the evil powers took place on New Year's day» 40 . The data handed down by way of the oral tradition concerning enthrone- ment festivals (which, as noted, were held in conjunction with Nowrõz) go hand in hand with findings yielded by monuments of art. Turning now to Persian works of art, we shall commence in Persepolis. A long ago as 1957, R. Ghirshman wrote: «Persépolis était une idée de Darius de créer non pas une capitale dans le sens politique que nous donnons à ce terme, mais une capitale réservée aux cérémonies de la plus grande fête religieuse, celle du Now Rouz ou Jour de l'An, qui était en meme temps une fête nationale et imperiale» 41.The same theory concerning Persepolis as: «the embodiment in stone of the whole New Year ritual system... an Achaemenian dream of the 40 G.

Pope, K. Erdman and M. Boyce 43. Moreover, there is little point in stressing the fact that one of the sequences depicted on the parapets of the stairway of the apadãna in Persepolis is indeed a procession of donors of different ethnic origins represented by the Achaemenian empire. Rupestrian reliefs show actual investiture or enthronement scenes. On oc- casion, as in Naqsh-i Bahram, there is merely the outline of the king with a few dignitaries gathered around. Elsewhere, the enthronement scene may be connected to other episodes engraved in various points of the wall selected to immortalyze the event. This is true in the case of Bishapur VI, where the ruler, seated on the throne (Shapur II?), is surrounded by double row of gift-bearer spread out over two registers, frozen in the act of triumphant celebration 44. Likewise, in the Tang-i Sawlak reliefs, the investiture ceremony is carried on in conjunction with an enthronement scene showing two rows of donors. Next to these are scenes of horsemen on a lion hunt, and about to slay and ennemy 45 . The enthronement-hunt connection, previously noted on the Střelka plate, may be best appreciated in Taq-i Bustãn. In this locality, in fact, high-relief engravings in two scenes have been found in the Great Grotto: the coronation of the ruler by Ahuramazda and Anahita, whereas, on the lower register, the ruler and his horse are in cataphract, wearing heavy riding armour. Various theories have been advanced as to the identity of the ruler (varying from Peroz to Khusro) and subsequently with respect to the dating of the sculptures, which ranges from the end of the 5th to the end of the 6th century A.D. 46 . The walls on the sides of the Grotto portray a royal hunt. The event, in all its royal grandeur is 'related' throughout its several stages: to the righ is the ruler exiting the palace, escorted by servants, while on the bottom, a double row of musicians are shown performing; next is the ruler shooting an arrow at a herd 42 C.

The scenario shown on the opposite wall is entirely different: here the ruler is depicted in a boat while crossing a pond with dense vegetation in which a herd of wild boar is vainly seeking refuge. Beside the king there are oarsmen and musicians; next are maidens in a boat who are playing various instruments or raising their hands as though dancing. To the sides are again servants earring game on mighty elephants 47 . It appears that the study of the ancient monuments bears out the close relationship between New Year Feast and Royalty, as well as that between Coronation and Royal Hunt. It should also be stressed that the affinity between kingship and hunting is such a firmly-engraned pattern in the Persian artistic tradition, that it becomes, par excellence, a motif taken up in the Sasanian heritage, or, at any rate, one which remained alive for a very long time. It becomes a standard iconographie pattern adhered to far depicting scenes having the same meaning, throughout various regions and later time periods. Hunting scenes can be seen depicted on 6th-7th century cloths brought to light in Egypt or Byzantium, or inside medallions embellishing 10th- 11th cent, isla- mic fabrics 48. In this case, the main focus, if not one of actual investiture, will be concerned with horsemen or huntsmen on foot, standing around the tree of life. Moreover, the latter may be linked to the ruler who, according to the Sasanian outlook on kingship, is the corner-stone of the kingdom, the giver of life to this subjects by virtue of the powers granted him at divine behest. Also worthy of note is the ivory casket on display in the cathedral of Troyes. It stands as a late artefact attesting to the far-reaching spread of this theme in the western territories of Byzantine art. As is known, two figures on the cover are shown riding on horseback, moving away from an architectural structure - perhaps the city walls. Out from the door in the wall comes a woman holding a crown. On the long sides of the ivory casket are two hunting scenes. In the first one, the craftsman has - with great artistic acumen - depicted, underneath the cumbersome lock, a lion being struck down by two arrows shot from the bow of a horseman on the left, whereas on the right another equestrian figure, simmetrically aligned with the latter, is proceeding 47 S.

The other hunt is being led by an armed soldier striking with his spear a large wild-boar while a pack of hounds is pitted against the dying animal. Prominent scholars, voicing a range of differing opinion, have concerned themselves with the Troy es casket 49 . The issue has been the central focus of a detailed study by G. de Francovich, who concludes that the cover to the casket bears the portrayal of an adventus Augusti «... ad una città del suo regno, che trionfalmente lo accoglie» 50, and that the two horsemen, both those on the lid and those on the sides showing the hunting scene, are in actuality one and the same basileus. We are thus dealing with a celebration held in honor of the Emperor, ending in a royal hunt. The theme is doubtless one of Sasanian derivation in view of the ruler-hunt connection as well as of the recurring figure of the ruler serving to highlight subsequent moments of the narrated event. If the hunting motif may be said to enjoy such artistic longevity, the same holds time for New Year Festivals. Its observance in the provinces of Sogdiana and Chorasmia, is documented as far back as al-Blrünl 51 , along with other historians both Arabic and Persian, and poets such as Ferdowsi, instrumental in holding down the above tradition. In a brief excursus , Christensen 52 deals with the written tradition concerning Nowrõz, drawing on accounts provided by 16th, 17th and 18th century European travellers. One Dubeux, known to have written a book on Persia in the 15th century, state that Nowrõz «est célébré en memoire de l'élévation d'Ali au Califat» 53. At the time of this festival the heads of various cities and provinces under the caliphate's rule, brought gifts and placed them before the king on the throne. Festive happening held simultaneously with Nowrõz, included sporting events, games, promenades, horseback riding, outings on the banks of rivers or lakes. The gifts consisted basically of tributes brought by overlords from the various regions to the king, who, as in the case of Persepolis during the reign of Darius, kept the tributes in the royal treasury from which they were then given out to the dihqãn and the 49 I quote only the best known: R.

During Nowrõz, which in Sasanian time was carried on throughout the entire month of fravardîn, the ruler recei- ved and allotted gifts, whereas his subjects were involved in recreational activi- ties or performing religious rites. Sweets, for instance, were to be eaten at sun- rise and ablutions or at least mutual sprinklings were to be performed in water in the festive ritual, reminiscent, as stated earlier, of the festival very origins. Turning once again our attention to the paintings which decorate the walls of room 1 of Afrasiab, noteworthy is the fact that on the lower register of the western wall are gift-bearers, while on the upper register are the lords of Samarkand seated on carpets. The latter scene is very poorly preserved thereby virtually jeopardizing all attempts at deciphering their actions. In my opinion, one may safely venture to say they are involved in a banquet, since they are shown in the same attitude and position as the figures depicted in the banquet scenes in Pjandžikent or Balalyk Tepe. On the southern wall is a nuptial portrayal or rather a procession moving towards a building (the entrance of the palace?) where four notables appear in waiting. The procession is comprised of an elephant ridden by the prin- cess/spouse (?), her ladies in waiting, two high-ranking dignitaries from the kingdom, two priests with animals to be sacrified, the ruler/spouse (?). Peculiar signs enabling scholars to guess a specific meaning from the scene are, in my opinion, the sceptre shaped like an aquatic animal (crocodile?) with an egg in its mouth, and the presence of a priest leading a horse which - as in the case of the Kaška Darya ossuary - may well be intended as a royal sacrifice. On the northern wall is a scene of a leopard hunt. Is it to be looked upon as a royal hunt? This likelihood should not be ruled out. As noted previously, the size of the first horseman is larger than that of the others. Opposite the former is the leopard, facing away with front paws raised as the beast is about to be struck down by a spear; on the ground beside the horse, lies another leopard in the throes of death. This is the pattern followed by the craftsmen who depicted the royal hunting scenes on Sasanian silver plates. In the above sequence the would-be ruler is not wearing a crown and is pitted against a leopard rather than a lion, deer or boar which are usually so admirably portra- yed in Sasanian toreutics. There may, however, be variations to the Persian silverware pattern. Thus, with regard to the headdress, on the occasion the horseman is crownless or, as indeed stated 54, the ruler may have worn a head- piece different from the crown while on the hunt; really, he may have used even 54 R.N.

In the Afrasiab painting the upper part of the horseman's bodies is obliterated and the reconstruction prov- ided by Al'baum, it is felt, is essentially based on the sole figure (no. 4) whose outlines are clearly visible. This figure is wearing a black head-piece with two loose ribbons extending down to the nape of the neck. Also in the case of the leopard, although rather seldom appearing in hunting scenes, at least three examples may be given: the Klimova plate in the Hermitage Museum 55 , a bowl unearthed in Cilek, published by B.I. Maršak 56, currently on display in the Museum of Samarkand, and finally a plate kept in the Tenri Sankoukan Museum in Nara, studied by Katsumi Tanabe 57. In this regard, the latter points out that tiger and leopard hunting was a customary practice in the eastern regions, to such an extent that it is depicted on a Kusãna ivory plaque from Takht-i Sangin (Tadjikistan) as well as on paintings in Varakhsha and Afrasiab. The last horseman stops on the banks of a river. Just below this are squa- ring figures shown in more or less discernible activities. Two boats are seen in the water: one with men in it and the other with female musicians off to the sides of a female figure in the middle, dressed in a long-sleeved cloak extending over the hands. Here the reading becomes more difficult. On the one hand this scene is reminiscent of the walls of the Great Grotto in Taq-i Bustãn, wherein the female musicians time and again seem to fit in naturally with the ruler's hunting retime, on the other hand there is a cluster of maidens which may be taken as a troup of musicians and dancers headed towards the palace to enhance festive spirits. Water imagery once more shows up on the eastern wall, peopled with var- ious characters either anthropomorphic or animal-like. Games are in progress, in this instance played in the water, likewise, on the northern segment of the same wall, games are being played on dry land; off to the far north is a horse- shaped figure which appears to be the connecting link vis-a-vis the hunting scene taking place beside the latter sequence, on the northern wall. By way of conclusions, it is hoped that sufficient evidence has been marshalled in corroboration of the claim posited several pages back, i.e. that the Afrasiab paintings were designed to portray the time when the ruler Var- goman, in becoming ikhshid of Sogdiana, is raised, by way of investiture, to this new position in the context of a solemn festive occurence: Nowrõz. 55 P.O.

Before the viewer are the gift- bearers, the hunt, the hierogamia and, perhaps, the sacrificial offering and the royal banquet. Then, there is a ludicrous frame: the games, as the water, are all features which remain somewhat sketchy, in the light of chronicles and canoni- cal books; nonetheless, they are clearly intended to highlight not the reasons for which the festival was being held, but rather the various distinct ways it was actually carried on. Finally, as previously stated, the missing wall sections leave room for any number of interpretations, which, for this very reason, must be considered as working hypotheses. The present paper is thus an attempt at providing an overall reading for the entire pictorial sequence of the room which has been the focus of attention restoring the vision of a unified artistic wholeness which, in my opinion, was indeed a key element from earliest times.
