Rather than oppositions, between past and present, high and low, male and female, content and structure, there is a continuum, or a telescoping of meaning in the extremely compact symbolism of Potu Raju, Mariyamman, the samT, and the Vedic sacrificial post. As the book's title indicates, these "post stories" have for their center of gravity the Hindu goddess, whose mythology and ritual, independent of those of the great gods Visnu and Siva, have united, for millennia, all of the "dualities" of the Hindu tradition, from the schematization of the Vedic sacrificial ground to present- day fire walking and hook swinging. DAVID GORDON WHITE University of Virginia The Vedic Origins of Karma: Cosmos as Man in Ancient Indian Myth and Ritual. By HERMAN W. TULL. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1989. Pp. x+181. Tull previews as follows his thesis on the continuities and transitions in the doctrine of karma: "The nature of that activity [i.e., the actions of a lifetime of ritual performance], which had been contained in the closed world of the ritual, now [in the Upanisads] determines the conditions of the sacrificer's afterlife within the larger cosmos. This [upanisadic] interpretation of the karma doctrine differs from the doctrine's apparent meaning in later texts, which propose that an individual attains to a specific state in the afterlife, or is reborn, according to the moral quality of all sorts of actions performed prior to death" (p. 2). This claim presupposes that there is a close connection between the Brahmanas (texts of ritual reflection and practice) and the Upanisads (later texts with a more apparent speculative, perhaps philosophical bent)-two sets of texts which had previously been treated as quite divergent in spirit and significance. Tull's thesis and its presupposition are important ideas deserving serious attention, and his work is an able exploration of how the general connection between the Brahmanas and Upanisads works itself out in the specific case of karma. Tull is certainly not the first to argue that the Upanisads are to be read in the light of the Brahmanas: this view is largely taken for granted by scholars today, and Tull readily acknowledges his many predecessors on this topic. Regarding the application to the instance of karma, Tull is more original, and we can be grateful for his contribution. But it is important to distinguish precisely where his originality is, and what contribution he makes. Though he breaks new 87</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews ground, he does not offer us a definitive summation of what the Brahmanas and Upanisads have to say about karma; a broadly based study would be required for this, while he focuses almost entirely on the Satapatha Brdhmana and the Brhaddranyaka Upanisad. Nor can this book be a conclusive identifi- cation of "where karma began," or even a proof that karma has distinctly Vedic roots; here too, a much broader reading of the Upanisads, Brahmanas, and related Vedic and non-Vedic sources would be required to show that the demon- strated continuities are uniquely rooted in the texts and milieu examined. Tull's work offers us something else, less comprehensive and indologically conclusive, but nevertheless of great value to students of theology and religion: an inquiry into how karma developed as a doctrine, that is, into how a particular community went about developing and expressing its response to a vexed question-the human destiny after death-in a way that was faithful to its sources, expressed in available words, images, and concepts, while also sensitive to the demands of a new situation. The book succeeds in this way, as a thoughtful reflection on how a doctrine of karma seems to have developed in certain early Upanisadic texts on the basis of a ritual paradigm already developed and practiced in the Brahmanas. Each of the three major chapters sets forth another aspect of the Brahmanic and Upanisadic responses to the possibilities and problems of creativity, con- struction, and death. Chapter 2 considers the ideology "that the cosmos arose from the sacrifice of a primordial anthropomorphic being," as illustrated in the myth of the dismemberment of the purusa; it examines also the brahmanic modification of the implied requirement that the sacrificer should die in the complete act of sacrifice. Tull observes that the myth of Prajapati, the creator who produces the cosmos out of himself, serves as the vehicle for a modification of certain elements of "the established Vedic mythology of the cosmic man," a shift "from a disjunctive to a conjunctive model of creation" (p. 4). Chapter 3 considers the construction of the fire altar (in the agnicayana rite) as the developed enactment of this conjunctive model: "based on the paradigm of Prajapati's creative activity, building the altar seeks to re-create the anthro- pomorphic cosmos that signifies a state of wholeness and immortality," and so "to reunify man's material being with the essential aspect of existence and thereby to regain the original state of wholeness" (p. 100). Chapter 4 then describes the transition from the enclosed world of ritual karma and its carefully circumscribed values to the broader cosmic schema of karma in which the deceased sacrificer is actually transferred to the heavenly world. He concludes: "In the case of the Upanisadic karma doctrine the essential struc- tures that must be attended to in the Vedic substrata are the Brahmanic notions of the ritual process that leads the sacrificer, during the course of the ritual performance, to the attainment of specific otherworldly realms, for the correla- tions that are established in the ritual world-albeit on a symbolic level- eventually lead the sacrificer, upon death, to the attainment of an afterlife existence in the real cosmos. The distinctions between these two forms of attainment-the symbolic attainments of the ritual world and the actual at- tainments brought about by the individual's death-may represent the primary 88</page><page sequence="3">History of Religions distinction between the Upanisadic karma doctrine and the Brahmanic princi- ples that precede it" (p. 120). Tull's work is thus a developed case study in the sources and development of the origins of a doctrine. It is particularly interesting because it produces for an Indian set of texts the kind of reflective analysis and tracing of development that has more frequently been done regarding biblical and early Christian materials, and is carried out in a way that theologians should find accessible. I will mention here by way of example three ways in which Tull's work opens up rich possibilities for comparative reflection. First, we are afforded a glimpse into a construction of self and a view of the afterlife which are legitimately "theological" (my word, not Tull's), while yet proceeding without (at least early on) the doctrine of a substantial soul. Second, Tull's work introduces us to a distinctively Indian ritual paradigm of knowledge and action, which here pro- vides an adequate basis for an understanding of the afterlife. Third, his correct differentiation of a ritual theory of karma from broader ethical doctrines of karma-which become prominent later-enables us to speculate on how this Upanisadic karma doctrine helps create the possibility for the ethical accounts and, in general, how descriptions of ethical practices develop from ritual ones. If it is correct to say that this theological and comparative thrust is the book's greatest contribution, I may be excused for wishing that Tull had told us a bit more about doctrine, and how he distinguishes the composition of a doctrine from the various speculations, practices, analogies, and teachings which are only gradually recomposed into formally presented and defensible doctrines. The "Vedic doctrine of karma" may turn out to be only a "pre- doctrine," or an incipient, incomplete doctrine or, perhaps, a series of doctrines which supersede one another. Such clarifications, even briefly stated, would have framed and enhanced the specific example he traces, and made it easier for us to locate this Upanisadic rendering of karma in relation to later orthodox reformulations of it, especially in the obliquely developed positions we find in the Uttara Mlmamsa (the Vedanta).

This volume, dedicated to Wach's students, will ensure that new generations of students of religion will continue to learn from Wach's seminal ideas.
