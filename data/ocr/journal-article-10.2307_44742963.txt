Chandler Civil Aeromedicai Institute Federal Aviation Administration ABSTRACT The use of injury criteria as a basis for the acceptance of seats and restraint systems designed to possess some capacity for crash injury protection has been common for several years in military aircraft and automotive systems, but has only recently been considered for civil aircraft systems. This paper will present the background for the concept of "injury criteria" as distinct from "voluntary human tolerance," and will explain methods used in developing certain criteria which are most likely to be useful in evaluating civil aircraft seat and restraint system performance. Finally, techniques for using the measurements in testing will be summarized, and guidance will be provided to the system designer which may assist in meeting the goals established by the criteria. INTRODUCTION The problem of protecting a human occupant of an aircraft seat from impact injury was first addressed in a systematic manner during the development of ejection seats for military fighter aircraft during World War II. Geertz, an engineer working for the Heinkel aircraft company, accomplished an analytical and experimental study of ejection seat injury mechanisms while working towards an advanced degree under Dr. Ruff (1)*. The conclusions of that work were later summarized by Ruff (2), and formed the basis for much subsequent postwar research. Of particular interest was the tolerance curve, reproduced as Figure 1, which indicated that the allowable acceleration for vertically upward loading (Gz), as experienced in an ejection seat, was dependent on the duration of the acceleration. For longer durations, inadequate blood circulation becomes the limiting factor, and for somewhat shorter durations the body was considered to be critical from the viewpoint of static structural loads. However, for the shorter durations typical of impact or crash conditions, the dynamic response of the body became important. In 1959, Eiband (3) summarized the results of the wartime and early post war research, and followed Ruff's format to present the data. These presentations, called "Eiband curves", are often represented as the limits of human tolerance to impact even today. For example, the current U.S. Army Crash Survival Design Guide (4) proposes a slightly modified version of the Geertz/Ruff /Eiband curve as the design goal for energy absorbing seats to be used in modern military helicopters. The original purpose of these curves was to provide the designer of military aircraft ejection seat systems with a description of a tolerable acceleration environment which could form a design goal for those systems. The concept of "tolerance" is important in such a design, due to the fact that if the ejection seat produced an acceleration environment which was intolerable, i.e., would cause injury, the pilot might hesitate to use the ejection seat, and take his chances in riding down the disabled aircraft to a crash. That would defeat the purpose of providing the ejection seat in the first place. Similar plots can be developed for other impact directions, and have recently been developed for simple lap belt restraint and lap belt and single diagonal shoulder belt restraint (5,6). Since these plots combine the results of numerous tests with different test parameters (seat and restraint design, human and animal surrogate subjects, impact pulse shapes, etc.), it is not possible to distinguish the effect of these parameters on the outcome of the tests. Yet it is generally acknowledged that these parameters can have a significant effect on the results. Moreover, since these curves are "whole body tolerance curves" it is difficult to define specific injury mechanisms which may be involved, and therefore it is thus even more difficult to take corrective action to reduce the injury. Those curves which were based solely on tests ^Numbers in parenthesis designate references at the end of the paper. 6.611 0096-736X/86/9406-061 1 $02.50 Copyright 1986 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">involving volunteer human subjects are even further limited, since those data are constrained to situations which avoid serious injury to the subjects, and thus cannot predict a suitable serious injury threshold for the non-voluntary crash environment. These problems were well recognized, and led to the development of mathematically defined injury criteria. INJURY CRITERIA Spinal Column Injury - One of the earliest developments in injury prediction was based, not on biomedical research, but on a problem in ballistics. In 1954 Kornhauser, while attempting to understand the action of a fuse mechanism during acceleration, studied a simple spring-mass model of the system and developed a "sensitivity curve" for actuation of the fuse which was dependent on elongation of the spring (7). The similarity of the Kornhauser "sensitivity curve," shown in Figure 2, to the tolerance curve for spinal impact is obvious. For short duration impacts, accelerations can be very high without exceeding the limit curve, but are less for increased impact duration or velocity. In 1957 Latham, concerned over spinal fracture in ejection seat operations, proposed that a similar spring-mass model be used as a tool for understanding the dynamic response of the spine (modeled as the spring) under varying conditions of vertical acceleration (8). Finally, in 1966, Stech and Payne developed a spring-mass model for ejection seat testing (9). The constants used in their model were based on biomechanical properties of the human body, and they suggested an injury index which was essentially a measure of the maximum compression of the spring in the model, which again represented the spinal column. This injury measure has become known as the "Dynamic Response Index", or DRI. It has been used by the Department of Defense as a criterion for the performance of ejection seats (10) and has been combined with acceleration limits in other directions for evaluating the performance of ejection capsules during ground impact as well as during separation from the aircraft (11). The DRI represented a significant advancement over the tolerance curves of Geertz/Ruff/Eiband for evaluating ejection seat performance because it was not limited to the idealized trapezoidal shaped impact pulse. Special computers were even developed which calculated the magnitude of the DRI from an impact pulse shape which was described by adjusting the position of a series of potentiometers to correspond to the acceleration- time history of the impact pulse (12). Moreover, Brinkley was able to correlate the DRI prediction with the frequency of spinal injuries observed in ejections (13). Unfortunately, the DRI has limitations which are difficult to accommodate in more general applications. Foremost among these is that the body is assumed to be held upright by a properly designed restraint system and that the acceleration used as input to the model must represent the overall acceleration of the seat. These limitations are accommodated in the military applications by careful design approval of the restraint system and by the universal use of a tairly rigid seat pan which enables a single acceleration measurement to be useful as input to the DRI model. Attempts to use acceleration measurements in the pelvis of the dummy used in tests of civil aircraft seats as input to a DRI computation has led to unrealistic results (14). Head Iniurv Criteria - At about the same time, a somewhat different approach was being taken in the study of head injury. Lissner studied the short duration (to 6 ms) impact of cadaver heads against a rigid surface and described the head acceleration required to produce linear skull fracture (15). This curve was later extended to longer pulse durations through the use of animal and human volunteer test data. Patrick et al. provided a tolerance curve of these data in the form of effective acceleration vs. pulse duration in 1965 (16), shown in Figure 3. This curve has become known as the "Wayne State Tolerance Curve," WSTC, and forms the basis for most head injury criteria today. The similarity of the shape of this curve to those previously described is evident. In 1961 Gadd observed that if these injury threshold curves were plotted on logarithmic scales an approximate straight line fit could be demonstrated (17). Moreover, he observed that an impact pulse could be evaluated for injury potential, i.e. exceeding the tolerance curve, by integrating the acceleration over the entire impact duration using a power weighting factor derived from the slope of the line. After publication of the WSTC, he found that the slope of the line representing that curve was approximately -2.5, and that a limit of 1000 for the integration would represent the threshold of injuries which were dangerous to life (18). This computation became known as the Gadd Severity Index, GSI, and was expressed by the equation: I f I 2.5 GSI = I a(t) dt &lt;1000 ^ 0 A significant critical analysis of this approach was done by Versace (19). While he felt that it would be better to have a measure of the response of the brain to head impact, he nevertheless suggested that an improved index number, based on existing data, could be obtained by calculating an effective acceleration multiplied by the time duration. This approach had a number of advantages. It was less sensitive to long duration, low level accelerations and could accommodate two or more sequential head impacts. In 1972, this approach was adopted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, NHTSA, as a means of evaluating head impacts in 6.612</page><page sequence="3">851847 automobile crash tests (20). This became known as the Head Injury CriterionÂ» HIC, and is represented by the equation: ' - f I i" HIC = tt.-V I a (t) dt &lt;1000 L V', J where ''a1' is the resultant acceleration of the center of mass of the head and tÄ¼and tÄ¼ are any two points in time during the crash. The regulation has varied several times in regard to defining the interval during which the HÄªC is to be calculated. At the time of this report, NHTSA has proposed limiting the computation of the HIC to when "during the crash of the vehicle there is evidence of head contact with any part of the vehicle other than the belt system" (21). Of course, more sophisticated models have been developed to evaluate head injury, including several spring-mass concepts (22,23,24), finite element techniques (25,26,27), and the effects of angular acceleration (28,29) and lateral and superior-inferior impacts (30,31). Other Iniurv Criteria - It is obvious from the above that research pertaining to measures of crash injury has progressed far beyond the simple curves of Geertz, Ruff, and Eiband. Although the examples presented so far have addressed lumbar spinal column and head injury, great progress has al so been made in defining injury limits for other segments of the body. Although portions of that work will be mentioned later, a complete summary of all injury criteria research is far beyond the scope of this paper. In any event, two excellent general summaries have recently been completed. The Human Injury Criteria Task Force of the Society of Automotive Engineers, SAE, has recently upgraded the SAE Information Report on impact injury (32), and a literature review pertaining to impact injury in the head, spine, thorax, abdomen, pelvis and lower extremities has been completed as part of a larger NHTSA study directed towards improved anthropomorphic dummies (33). While both of these efforts were aimed primarily at automotive occupant injuries, the information they contain is equally applicable to aircraft occupants, since injury sensitivity is a characteristic of the occupant, not the vehicle. INJURY CRITERIA IN THE GASP RECOMMENDATIONS In 1983, the General Aviation Safety Panel, GASP, under the leadership of John Alcott, formed a working group to recommend improvements in cra8hworthine8s for general aviation aircraft (34,35). It was apparent early in the deliberations of that group that dynamic evaluation of seat and restraint system performance was essential if significant improvements were to be made. This approach offered the opportunity to not only include injury criteria as part of the basis on which the adequacy of the seat/restraint system was judged, but also posed several problems in selecting criteria which were effective but yet practical within the resources likely to be available for such tests. While the precedents established by automotive and military aviation requirements were useful, adaptations had to be made. Judgements were also required as to the critical injuries which were likely to be of concern when the improved seat and restraint systems were placed into service. For example, while past accident investigation studies were of considerable interest, it was recognized that many of the injuries which were evident in those studies were caused by the lack of use of proper upper torso restraint systems, a condition which would not prevail if the GASP recommendations were effective. Findings from outside the aviation community were useful. Automotive experience indicated that torso injury, primarily rib fractures, could be expected with upper torso restraint belts, a condition also likely if torso restraint belts were commonly used in aircraft. However, the blunt chest trauma observed in automobile injuries as a result of contact with the steering wheel were not likely to occur in aircraft occupants with torso restraint because the aircraft control column cannot be rigidly fixed without destroying its function. It was also known that upper torso restraint systems were unlikely to completely prevent head contact with the vehicle interior in severe crashes. This injury potential is evaluated in automobiles by a system crash test of the entire automobile, an approach not suitable for general aviation aircraft because of the difficulty in precisely controlling an aircraft crash as well as the expense of such a procedure. From military experience it was known that if deaths were prevented by effective upper torso restraint, non-fatal injuries to the spinal column were likely to become more frequently observed. These concepts led to the development of injury criteria for the GASP recommendations. CHEST CRITERIA - Considerable research has been accomplished to define injury criteria for chest impacts from relatively flat impact surfaces, such as would reasonably represent automotive steering wheels/ columns or the automobile door in lateral impact. These conditions were considered to be of less significance to the general aviation occupant with upper torso restraint than would be the response due to belt loading. Tests with cadavers and animals have fairly consistently shown that cadavers receive more severe chest injuries than living subjects under similar crash conditions when belts were used, making direct comparisons difficult. Patrick, comparing injuries observed in crashes with measurements made on anthropomorphic dummies in similar controlled tests, concluded that belt load at the upper end of the shoulder belt was found to be 6.613</page><page sequence="4">"the most sensitive parameter to thoracic injury" (36). Foret-Bruno et al. provided useful information relating belt loads to injuries in automobile occupants (37). The fact that these data were obtained on living humans, not surrogates, makes these results especially important. The data for this study came from accident investigations of certain Peugeot and Renault automobiles which were equipped with an energy absorbing belt system in which successive ribbons of fabric tear as the belt force increases, thus giving an indication of the maximum force generated in the belt during the crash. This force was then correlated with the chest injuries received by the 92 occupants which formed the basis for the study. Among the data which were presented were the estimated shoulder belt torces for a 50th percentile probability of injuries which were determined to be severe but not life threatening injury, equivalent to AIS 3 (38). The data showed an expected variation according to the age of the occupant. Although the data in that report were presented in the form of ranges of threshold injury belt load for various age groups, it was found that the data when plotted appeared to conform to the smooth curve shown in Figure 4. A belt load of 1750 lbs was chosen as the injury criterion for the GASP recommendations. This would appear to correspond to a 50th percentile AIS 3 injury probability for an occupant about 37 years old. This is in consonance with the argument presented in the study that the load be as high as possible in order to improve protection should the crash environment be more severe than anticipated. The suitability of this recommendation was further confirmed by review of data collected at the Civil Aeromedicai Institute (CAMI) in evaluating the performance of a military style dual shoulder belt, non-energy absorbing upper torso restraint system which has provided good crash protection with minimal chest injury (39). Although the test data were obtained with a 95th percentile dummy, when corrected for the weight of the 50th percentile dummy and 42 f/s impact velocity referenced in the GASP recommendations, the data indicated a maximum 1600 lb total load would be likely in the upper torso restraint system. Because the increased body contact area provided by dual shoulder straps should result in less injury than a single diagonal belt, it was concluded that a 2000 lb load (1000 lb per shoulder belt) would be an adequate criterion for dual belt upper torso restraint systems evaluated under the GASP recommendations. HEAD INJURY CRITERION - The Head Injury Criterion, (HIC), has proved to be a practical and effective basis for evaluating head impacts in automobile tests, and the computation is easily accomplished in most test facilities likely to be used for the GASP recommended test procedure. The HIC is considered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration "to be the best currently available head injury indicator" (21). Although there is frequent interest in increasing the magnitude of the HIC limit from 1000 to 1500 or more, this interest is usually associated with the buildup of HIC values during relatively long duration, non-contact head motion which takes place in a crash prior to head contact with the interior. The HIC was chosen as the head injury indicator for the GASP recommendations, and the maximum duration of the HIC computation interval was limited to 50 ms in order to preclude the problems of long duration HIC buildup. This limitation was based on the guidance by Patrick in the presentation of the WSTC that, for times greater than 50 ms, a constant acceleration limit was justified (16). The more recent NHTSA proposal to limit the computation interval to that period of time when there is evidence of head contact with any part of the vehicle other than the belt system would certainly be an adequate limitation as well, and may be easier to implement. In developing seat/restraint systems for general aviation aircraft it is usually not practical to require that testing be done in conjunction with a section of fuselage cabin. Such a section may not have been developed at the time of the seat/restraint tests, or the seat/restraint systems may be intended for a variety of installations with different interiors. Because of this, it is not possible to present a system test of seat, restraint and interior which would be applicable in all cases. However, tests done in support of the GASP recommendations indicated that head contact with an aircraft interior was still possible, even though the contact velocity may have been significantly reduced by the action of the upper torso restraint system (34). To accommodate all these concerns, and yet still provide a means of evaluating the injury potential of head contact with the aircraft interior, the GASP recommended that a supplementary test procedure be used. In essence, this procedure would require that high speed motion picture film of the seat/restraint system tests be reviewed to determine if head contact with the aircraft interior would have occurred. This can be done by viewing the film against an overlay plan representing the interior of the aircraft. If contact would occur, measurements could be made from the film to determine the direction, magnitude and contact point of the velocity of projected head impact. These data would then be used to plan and conduct a supplementary test using a simple head form which was impacted against structure representative of the aircraft interior at the area of head contact. Acceleration would be measured on the headform, and used to calculate a HIC value which should not exceed 1000. Precedent for such a procedure has been developed by the SAE (40), and similar techniques have been used for evaluating head protection around school bus passenger seats (41). SPINAL INJURY CRITERION - Selection of a criterion for spinal injury was based on a desire 6.614</page><page sequence="5">851847 to recommend a measurement which would not restrict design innovation but which would assess the loads introduced into the spinal column either through the seat or through any downward component of upper torso restraint load which might unavoidably be present in a specific design. Conventional measures , such as accelerations or the DRI, do not consider the effect of restraint loading. Measures of restraint loads and direction would not consider loads transmitted through the seat pan. The most useful measurement would be one that directly reflected the stress in the spinal column, such as the force between the lumbar column and the pelvis. In a previous study attempts had been made at CAMI to develop such a measurement (42). Dummies were modified to incorporate a load cell between the rubber cylinder which simulated the spinal column and the dummy pelvis. These dummies were used in the final phase of an extensive cooperative program among the U.S. Army, the U.S. Navy and GAMI for the purpose of investigating design criteria for energy absorbing seats. The results of the load cell measurements showed considerable scatter, and it was thought at the time that the dummy had deteriorated from long use and was thus causing the scatter ., The dummy was refurbished, and used in another program at CAMI which investigated the performance of an energy absorbing seat with a rigid seat bucket. Data were measured which enabled computation of the DRI, and comparison of that computation with the load cell measurements was good, as shown in Figure 5. Of particular interest was the finding that seat orientations which used the seat back to restrain occupant movement, such as predominantly rearward facing seats, would result in a lower spinal column loading. The two lowest data points in Figure 5 resulted from this condition. This finding is in agreement with accident experience, which seems to indicate that occupants of rearward facing seats seem to have less tendency to lower spinal column injury as long as the seats are structurally adequate. And, since the friction loading of the seat back to the dummy was not controlled in the earlier tests, this may help to explain the variability of the data in those tests. For the recommendations of the GASP, a load limit of 1500 lbs was chosen. This would correspond to a DRI of about 19, as shown in Figure 5. Data for the military population indicate that the probability of detectable spinal injury at DRI = 18 is about 5 percent, and is about 20 percent at a DRI = 22. Thus a DRI of 19 would indicate an anticipated detectable spinal injury probability of about 9 percent. Computer simulations of the combined vertical test recommended by the GASP indicated that this load limitation could be accomplished with an effective energy absorbing stroke distance of slightly less than one inch for the average male occupant. However, if the seat were occupied by a large male (95 percentile), the stroke distance could approach 3 inches. While lower values of this load limitation may be beneficial to smaller occupants, they could increase the stroke distance for larger occupants such that the chance of "bottoming" the seat against the floor would increase their injury. It was concluded that the 1500 lb limitation was an effective compromise. The term "pelvic force" was used to describe this limitation in the GASP recommendations in order to avoid the temptation of comparing the measurement, which might be more logically called "lumbar spinal load," with the load capability of human lumbar vertebrae. Such a comparison would be meaningless because the biofidelity of the dummy is not equivalent to the human in the spinal direction. SUBMARINING AND ROLL OUT OF THE RESTRAINT SYSTEM - The potential for submarining under the seat belt of a restraint system has been recognized for several years, and was acknowledged by the GASP. Unfortunately, it is not readily quantified by measurements made on the recommended dummy, although several experimental prototype dummies can provide that indication. However, review of film coverage, and examination of loads measured in seat belt webbing (if accomplished during the test) can indicate the presence of submarining. Likewise, the tendency to roll out of the upper torso restraint system, a problem with some installations of single diagonal upper torso restraints, must be evaluated by observation of the film coverage of the tests. Both of these criteria are contained in the GASP recommendations. It was intended that these limitations apply only during the period of the test when the belts were carrying loads from the initial impact. In other words, the free rebound which takes place after the initial cycle of belt loading can result in gross dummy motion which cannot readily be controlled, and this motion should not be considered in this analysis. ANTHROPOMORPHIC DUMMIES FOR DYNAMIC TESTING The recommendations of the GASP include the use of a "Part 572" anthropomorphic dummy. This dummy has been prescribed for automobile testing since 1973 (43), and has demonstrated its utility in countless tests. However, for the purpose of the GASP recommendations, it will be necessary to modify the dummy to allow for insertion of a load cell capable of measuring axial loads transmitted between the dummy pelvis and rubber lumbar cylinder. For research purposes at CAMI, a load cell was selected which would measure bending moments and shear loads as well as axial loads (44). The axial length of this load cell was longer than the spacer block which it replaced in the dummy. Thus, it was necessary to bore a hole in the dummy pelvis to provide space for the load cell so that the dummy seated height could be maintained. The base of the load cell was then 6.615</page><page sequence="6">supported by a specially machined "can11 which fitted inside the hole in the pelvis and included a flange at the top to fasten to the top of the dummy pelvis. The top of the load cell was attached to the lumbar cylinder through the use of an adaptor plate which simply matched the bolt patterns in the load cell and the lumbar cylinder. This installation is shown in Figure 6. It is not necessary to use an identical installation for the GASP procedure. Any axial load cell which is insensitive to bending and shear loads, which is relatively stiff compared to the lumbar cylinder, and which can be installed between the dummy pelvis and lumbar cylinder while maintaining the dummy seated height should suffice. Several other dummies are currently available or are under development which may be suitable for use in the GASP procedure. Of particular interest would be the "Hybrid III" test dummy which is being proposed as an alternative to the Part 572 dummy and ultimately as its replacement (45). The Hybrid III dummy has improved biofidelity over the Part 572 dummy, and is capable of significantly more injury measurements - 31 vs. 8 for the Part 572 dummy - in its anticipated automobile test application. Unfortunately, it does not provide for the pelvic load measurement, and would require modification for use in the recommended GASP tests. It would also require recalibration against a known standard such as the DRI in order to define a pelvic load limitation equivalent to the 1500 lbs specified for the Part 572 dummy. It must also be noted that the Hybrid III dummy has nearly a 2 inch lower seated height than the Part 572 dummy, due to the Hybrid III dummy's slumped posture design intended to simulate the "relaxed slouch" of the average seated automobile occupant. This may not adequately represent the posture of a general aviation crewmember flying an aircraft in anticipation of a crash. Major redesign of the lower torso of the Hybrid III dummy is likely to be required for realistic representation of an aircrew member. Other dummies such as those being developed by the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy are not sufficiently defined to evaluate their potential application. CONCLUSION The recommendations of the General Aviation Safety Panel have, for the first time, included crash injury measures as a design goal for seat and restraint system performance in civil aircraft. These injury criteria, while limited in scope and quantity, address the major anticipated injuries. Other criteria which may be more applicable to specific installations can be found in the references included in this report, but are not considered necessary for universal application at this time. The active nature of research in the field of crash injury will undoubtedly provide a greater insight into injury mechanisms and methods for evaluating crash injury protection in the future. As these advances take place, it is hoped that the recommendations will be appropriately modified to reflect the state of the art. In attempting to achieve the goals set by these criteria, the designer should be aware of certain influences they will have on the design. For example, achieving the 1500 lb pelvic load limit may require the use of energy absorbing or load limiting concepts in the seat. This means that the seat would move downwards (stroke) during the test impact, and adequate clearance must be provided. However, the test is conducted with a 50th percentile anthropomorphic dummy, so that the downward seat motion will represent only that occupant weight. Heavier occupants would cause the seat to move through a greater distance, and the design should allow such motion without bottoming which could increase the chance of injury. In addition, if a load limiting seat concept is being developed, the designer is likely to have difficulty in predicting thÃ¨ performance of the load limiting seat components if there are other components which display highly elastic performance which are in series with the load limiting components. Thus, fabric, net or rubber seat pans, thick elastic foam comfort cushions on the seat, and seat adjustment mechanisms which do not provide a direct load path between the seat pan and the floor track are likely to cause problems. The designer should also be aware that armrests can result in artificially low pelvic load measurements as the dummy's arms contact them during the test, but they should not be considered as part of the load limiting mechanism unless the designer can assure that they will be used in that manner during an actual crash. Also, the designer should attempt to assure that any load limiting concept will perform at the intended level even if the seat is deformed by crash forces. Finally, the designer should note that the shoulder belt load limits are based on a test with a 50th percentile occupant, and that those loads will be greater if a heavier occupant is involved in a crash, and the structure should be capable of accommodating the higher loads. 6.616</page><page sequence="7">851847 REFERENCES 1.
