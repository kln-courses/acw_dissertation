L52,00. Conceived as a project entwining the "two cultures" of the humanities and the natural sciences, "fille der combination". Literaturforschung und Wissenschaftsgeschichte is a collection of resourceful readings assimilating scientific and literary texts and prac- tices. Its goals are to historicize science, evoke the scientific in literature, and find liter- ary influences in the laboratory. It accomplishes these goals with emphases on the per- vasive literary tools utilized in all forms of writing, on the "textual" generally, and on the nature of "letters"-the alphabet versus numbers, as Sigrid Weigel discusses in reference to the kabala and genetic code. Such goals are not to be underestimated, and indeed, the fine essays fall into four categories where they succeed in demon- strating 1) the exchanges between the "human" and natural sciences: "Passagen und Interferenzen"; 2) scientific ideas in literature: "Wissen im Prozess der Literatur"; 3) the relationships between "Poetologie und Epistemologie"; and 4) the implications of the writing process inherent even in the most "scientific" of discussions: "Inschrift- lichkeit des Wissens." As the editors note in the foreword, they seek systematic cross- referential exchanges among the fields rather than simple linear influences. Hence the book studies "einerseits de[n] impact der Kultur auf die Wissenschaft (die ja keines- wegs blo13 von der Rationalitit ihres eigenen Szientismus angetrieben wird) sowie andererseits das Eindringen von Figuren und Deutungsmustern der Wissenschaften in die verschiedenen Felder der Kultur" (13). The collection is a noteworthy contribution to the paradigm of the "world as text." Yet, it is worth mentioning in contrast the recent appearance of many works in science and literature proposing an interdisciplinary per-</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 557 spective that describes the world as nonlinear, nondeterministic complexity, as ordered and "creative" chaos, or as fractal patterns. Still, fille der combination reveals multiple impulses, even with its overall in- sistence on "texts," "writing," and the "alphabet." These various directions are repre- sented by two of the major figures in interdisciplinary work on science and literature: Hans-JTrg Rheinberger, the director of the Max-Planck-Institut fiir Wissenschaftsge- schichte in Berlin, and N. Katherine Hayles, professor of literature at UCLA. Hayles is discussed below. Rheinberger's focus on the epistemology of experiments is repre- sentative of the "cultural approach" in its leaning on Derrida. Other examples include Birgit Griesecke's marvelous essay on the possibly unifying notion of "Versuch" as both essay and experiment. She begins with the query as to whether one can find actual coherence "auf transdisziplinarem Terrain" (267). Griesecke's skepticism about how the two "cultures" "sail right on by each other"- she provocatively refers to "cultures" as an ethnographic issue as well-is well placed; yet her answer is Wittgenstein's grammar. Goethe she rejects (one mustn't always begin with Goethe, after all), yet her reason is because his "Versuch als Vermittler von Objekt und Subjekt" is "fest im Bereich der Naturwissenschaften verankert" (276)-does that mean automatic elimi- nation? Bernhard Dotzler, in turn, dedicates his entire essay "Epik der Wissenschaft: Goethe" to Goethe's Farbenlehre, though with similar results: Goethe is wrong about science, the contents are incorrect, but his treatise does demonstrate a "Literarizithit der Wissenschaften" and "Wissenschaftlichkeit im epistemologischen Literaturverstind- nis" (230). These two essays, along with Karlheinz Barck's "Literatur/Denken: Uber einige Relationen zwischen Literatur und Wissenschaft," are masterful analyses of the literary aspects of science and the cultural-historical developments of science such that we can see, as Barck puts it, "Literatur als Wissensform," and "Fiktion als Kunst- griff der Erfindung" (297, 298). Similarly, Helmut Mtiller-Sievers studies strategies of reading as forms of the "Entwicklung des wissenschaftlichen Blicks"; Robert Matthias Erdbeer describes the development of a "Deskriptionspoetik" in Humboldt's Kosmos; and Christoph Hoffmann claims that Gottfried Benn establishes a medical process of writing based not on patients but, of course, on texts. This is Benn's "kompilatorisches Prinzip," or a path towards literature: "In Benns medizinischen Schriften, den mediok- ren genauso wie den preisbewehrten, nimmt Gedrucktes und Geschriebenes ganz und gar den Platz des Forschungsgegenstands ein" (338). In sum, this is a study of "texts" and "textuality." In terms of essays that seek the scientific in the literary or, better, that seek more general interactions amongst the disciplines, one can turn to the first two sections of the book. Hayles' essay on "computing the human" continues her work of de-centering the anthropomorphic view that human beings are unique. She does this by suggesting that human beings and "intelligent machines" share the ability to "act" by responding to their environment and by developing that response without teleological intention, a result which implies that consciousness is merely an epiphenomenon. Other essays in the first section draw clear connections between cultural or literary concepts and technological innovations, such as Laura Otis's noteworthy analysis of technical net- works-like the telegraph-as the model for the nervous system, and vice versa, but also other significant studies on the postal service, biological codes, and the sound- proof laboratory. Strongly focusing on the scientific models are Wolf Kittler's essay, which like Otis's describes distributed networks as well as the "kinetische Gastheorie</page><page sequence="3">558 Monatshefte, Vol. 99, No. 4, 2007 in Robert Musils Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften," and Michel Chaouli's piece, which fruitfully examines Friedrich Schlegel's aphorisms that replicate the path from "the organic to the chemical." If the gist of the overall collection is "science as text" or "knowledge as code," Chaouli undermines the "two-cultures" dichotomy more pow- erfully with his insistence on replacing the "zwei unvers5hnliche Alternativen" with a model of cross-infection. Instead of isolating the so-called "organic" from the me- chanical-mathematical, Chaouli sees Schlegel's work as a "chemische Konzeption der Natur," that is not teleological, but rather that "erweitert auch die Grenzen der Natur" (113) into art. Chaouli's "chemical" creativity and art, Kittler's distributed networks, Otis's communications systems, and Hayles's human-machine interface participate in the move towards understanding nonlinear theories of complexity that promise so much in 21st-century thought. This collection itself thus provides a provocative interface between postmodern paradigms and complexity theory, and it should be of interest to any reader seeking interdisciplinary models of texts and world.
