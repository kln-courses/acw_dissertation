<plain_text><page sequence="1">Melville J. Herskovits and the arts of ancient Dahomey SUZANNE PRESTON BLIER From the seventeenth through the late nineteenth century, the Dahomey kings of what is now Benin Republic (fig. 1) aggressively expanded their hegemony, coming to dominate a large area between Yoruba and Asante.1 Dahomey's powerful military organization, elaborate religious rites, vibrant court, and wealth of art treasures impressed European visitors, many of whom provided vivid descriptions of what they saw (fig. 2).2 Following the overthrow of the kingdom by the French in 1894, the body of literature on Dahomey (Fon) culture continued to grow, and today we have a wealth of studies by later visitors as well ? anthropologists, historians, religious scholars, and administrators. In many respects, one of the best known of these later writers is the American scholar Melville J. Herskovits. Herskovits, traveling to Dahomey in 1931, was the first major figure in American anthropology to do research in Africa. A former student of Franz Boas, Herskovits, like his mentor, viewed art as an important aspect of culture. His prior research experience in Surinam in 1928 and 1929 already attests to this view, for art was a central focus of the Surinam study (1930). For an anthropologist interested in art, Dahomey in 1931 was a rich research setting. Abomey, the traditional home of Fon kings, still maintained its royal artisan guilds, specializing then, as in the past, primarily in metal arts and textiles. Herskovits's two volume work on Dahomey (Dahomey: An Ancient West African Kingdom, New York, 1938) reflected his deep interest in the arts, and large segments of this study are concerned with them and with the Dahomey religious and political institutions that are closely associated with these traditions.3 Herskovits's impact on the field of African art has extended far beyond the parameters of Dahomey art scholarship, however. He founded and chaired the influential African Studies Program at Northwestern University (the first of its kind in the United States), and many of this country's best-known African anthropologists were trained under his guidance. Not only did he stress the importance of fieldwork, something which even art historians now accept as the sine qua non of viable scholarship in the field, but he also encouraged his students to look at art as an essential component of culture. It is not surprising, therefore, that many of his students?including William Bascom, Justine Cordwell, Daniel Crowley, Warren d'Azevedo, James Fernandez, Paul Gebauer, John Messenger, Alan Merriam, and Simon Ottenberg? have gone on to make major contributions to African art scholarship. In addition, two of this country's most important senior African art historians?Roy Sieber and Robert F. Thompson ? although not formally students of Herskovits, share many of his same research interests and orientations. This year (1988) marks both the fiftieth anniversary of Melville Herskovits's well-known and influential study Dahomey and the twenty-fifth anniversary of his death 1. The original draft of this essay was presented on a panel titled Re-evaluating Our Predecessors: Ethnographic Art Historians Look Back, organized by Janet Berlo for the College Art Association annual meetings in 1985. Field research was undertaken on two separate occasions in Abomey, the capital of the Dahomey kingdom. The first trip, in the summer of 1984, was supported by a grant from the Institute of African Studies and the Council for Research in the Humanities at Columbia University. A more lengthy trip in 1986 1987 was supported by a Fulbright-Hays Senior Research Fellowship and a Social Science Research Council Fellowship. In the course of writing this article, I analyzed Herskovits's unpublished Dahomey field notebooks, which were then on loan to the National Museum of African Art in Washington, D.C., and are now at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York City. Unpublished diary extracts from the Herskovits field research period in Dahomey have also been analyzed, along with other materials from the Herskovits archives in the library of Northwestern University. I thank Jean Herskovits, Robert Morris, Hans Panofsky, and Roy Sieber for their help in locating and studying these materials. This paper also has benefited by the close reading and critical comments of Simon Ottenberg, as well as Edna Bay and Patrick Manning (historians of Dahomey culture); conversations with Ivan Karp and James Fernandez also were of importance. An in-depth analysis of Herskovits's field methodologies is in preparation. 2. Eighteenth-century travelers to the Dahomey capital at Abomey such as Norris (1789) and Dalzel (1793) have left written accounts of the courts of Kings Kpengla and Agonglo. The nineteenth century visitors Forbes (1851), Burton (1864), and Skertchly (1874) in turn wrote extensive descriptions of the courts of Kings Guezo and Glele. 3. It is not without significance, in this light, that two of the nine selected writings by Herskovits that are republished by George Simpson in his book (Simpson 1973) deal with Dahomey art. These are Melville and Frances Herskovits's "The Art of Dahomey: Brass casting and Appliqu? Cloths" and "The Art of Dahomey: Wood Carving," both reprinted from the American Magazine of Art (1934, vol. 27, no. 2, 3). Herskovits also wrote two general works on African art: The Background of African Art (1945) and "Art and Value," in Aspects of Primitive Art, by Robert Redfield, M. J. Herskovits, and G. F. Ekholm (1959). A large section of Man and His Works (New York 1947) also is concerned with art.</page><page sequence="2">126 RES 16 AUTUMN 88 Figure 1. Map showing Dahomey and nearby kingdoms. (1963). Dahomey, still remarkable today for its breadth and quantity of data, attests both to the breadth of research of Melville Herskovits and to the richness of Dahomey culture itself, and as such it has served as a model for many later anthropological works on Africa. While Herskovits has been the subject of several recent studies (particularly with respect to his contributions on Afro-American culture and the concept of cultural relativism),4 remarkably little has been written about Herskovits's Dahomey research findings or his perspectives on Dahomey art. The few published comments by scholars who followed Herskovits in looking at various aspects of Dahomey culture are at once positive and critical.5 For example, Paul Mercier writes favorably (1954: 211) of Herskovits's clarification of the mass of earlier data, as collected and published by Le H?risse (1911). At the same time, however, Mercier suggests (p. 211, n. 3; p. 227, n. 2) both that Herskovits's shrine analyses and estimates are "less factual" than those of C. Merlo (1940) and that Bernard Maupoil's observations (1943) on the soul are "on the whole more accurate" than those which Herskovits provides. Mercier also suggests (p. 227, n. 2, n. 4) that several of his own findings contradict those of Herskovits's earlier investigations. Another scholar who notes occasional contradictions between his own and Herskovits's findings is Bernard Maupoil, who was in Dahomey roughly at the same time as Herskovits.6 In addition, Maupoil is critical of Herskovits's main source of information. He writes in this light (1943: 65, n. 1) that "if one knows that the principal informant of Herskovits aspired to resuscitate, clandestinely and for his own profit, the royal cult of Toxosu . . . one understands the interest that he had in attesting to the decadence [of the cult of Mawu]." A similar criticism with respect to Herskovits's primary research source is leveled by Maurice Ahanhanzo Glele (1974: 25), who writes that "the work of Herskovits . . . contains good elements but must be studied with a lot of critical spirit, in regard to his principal informant, the professional [guide] Rene Aho." On balance, similar statements regarding the use of a single informant could be (and indeed have been) made with respect to a number of earlier anthropological writers. Indeed, the criticisms that have been raised in print about Herskovits's Dahomey research are remarkably few, considering not only this scholar's renown and the vast amount of research that has been done since his study, but also the amount of material that Herskovits published and the length of time that has passed since it appeared. A work of the importance of Herskovits's Dahomey merits a thorough critical examination. The present essay is not that reassessment, however, for it is concerned solely with Herskovits's writings on Dahomey art. Nonetheless, to the extent that art is a central means of societal expression, the issues raised also may have relevance for other aspects of Herskovits's Dahomey research.7 Discussion here is 4. See Walter Jackson (1986) and the biographical overview of Herskovits by Joseph H. Greenberg (1971). See also G. Simpson (1973). 5. A review of Dahomey by H. A. Wieschoff that appeared in American Anthropologist in 1939 is very favorable. 6. Maupoil's criticisms include Herskovits's remarks on the function of the Ayido Hwedo court in the palace (p. 75, n. 1), his discussion of homosexuality (p. 162, n. 1), and his overview of human sacrifice for the deity Mawu (p. 370, n. 2). Edna Bay has pointed out (personal communication, December 15, 1986) that Herskovits's work came under criticism by Maupoil early on. Herskovits notes in Dahomey (1938 I: p. 70, n. 1) that Maupoil questioned his findings concerning the Dahomey census. 7.

King Agonglo (1789-1797) at the palace (published in Archibald Dalzel, The History of Dahomey: An Inland Kingdom of Africa, London, 1793, opp. p. vii). structured around three key questions in Herskovits's analysis of Dahomey art. They are (1) the relative place of history in Herskovits's art overview, (2) the issue of Dahomey political hierarchy and its impact on art, and (3) the question of Dahomey cultural homogeneity. Herskovits's use of history in Dahomey art analysis To Herskovits, history was essential to the understanding of culture.8 In the preface to Dahomey (1938 I: vi) he states that "care has been taken to draw on all possible sources to give a time perspective to the data gathered in the field. . . ." With this in mind, Herskovits quotes extensively from the reports of previous travelers to Abomey, particularly the nineteenth-century writers Skertchly and Burton. The two-volume Dahomey is very much enriched by these numerous citations. But how viable is Herskovits's historical analysis? Several problems can be seen with regard to it. For one, Herskovits approaches these earlier sources in a way that is distinctly ahistorical: he nearly always uses examples of nineteenth-century royal art or pageantry as if they were parallel and complementary to art traditions Herskovits himself was observing in the 1930s, when there was no longer a king on the throne in Abomey. In this he seems to have viewed Dahomey culture and art as essentially static, and saw very little change as having taken place either in the course of the kingdom or as a result of the French removal of the king at the turn of the century.9 Marcus (1986)?have led the way to a closer reading of the writings of earlier anthropologists and a fuller exploration of the intellectual climate in which they were written. Melville J. Herskovits, as a central figure in American anthropology, is of considerable importance in terms of anthropological scholarship in the 1930s. This essay thus may also be of significance with respect to Herskovits's general research and writing during this period. 8. Simon Ottenberg notes similarly in a personal communication of February 5, 1987, that when I was at Northwestern, history was still a very important part of the anthropological picture, especially Afro-American-African connections. But Herskovits was not trained as an historian and did not press his students to get such training. There was mainly colonial African history at that time, which he suspected. Ottenberg goes on to add that "Boas had a strong historical interest, but it was in tracing aspects of culture through diffusion to a large extent, a major preoccupation of American anthropology at that time (1930's)." 9. Herskovits writes in Man and His Works (1947: 20) that "culture is dynamic; ... the only completely static cultures are dead ones."</page><page sequence="4">128 RES 16 AUTUMN 88 \ *? u 1 Ja ? * * ^^K HI 1 i* ^ Figure 3.

Reproduced with permission of Northwestern University Press. Thus he notes that (1938 II: 372) "the artists who work in [the metal and appliqu? traditions] . . . make the same products as in the days of Dahomean autonomy . . . [and] the accepted patterns ... of many generations are still living patterns."10 At the same time, Herskovits also emphasizes the importance of artistic change and is very concerned with refuting the standard view of the period, which assumed that African arts are by nature static. In his words (1938 II: 337-338): A generalisation concerning primitive art that has had wide vogue holds that the art of primitive folk is more fixed and less subject to change than the arts of literate people. No better exception to this position could be offered than in the case of Dahomean applique designs. Yet the changes Herskovits refers to in the appliqu? works are variations in imagery (a lion versus a leopard, for example) and composition, rather than changes in the nature of the appliqu? form itself. This fact is important, for the tableau-form appliqu?s that Herskovits illustrates and discusses in Dahomey (fig. 3) are a relatively late (nineteenth-century) development. According to the families who made these works, the prototypes of these appliqu?s were originally espionage maps, which gave them a very different function and form from the later ones.11 The situation with Dahomey metal sculptures is even more striking. Herskovits illustrates a number of cire perdue castings (fig. 4) and discusses them as traditional Figure 4. Dahomey brass figure of a hunter, h. 7V* in. Collected by M. and F. Herskovits in 1933.

According to Simon Ottenberg (personal communication, February 5, 1987), Herskovits's insistence on the continuity of discrete art forms may be based in part on his emphasis on cultural relativism. 11.

The emphasis he places on these brass castings is somewhat problematic, however, since this technique dates to around the time of the conquest and is identified primarily as a tourist art tradition.12 The pre-conquest Dahomey metal sculptures, by and large, were not cast but instead were carved of wood and covered with hammered sheets of silver or brass (fig. 5). Herskovits appears either to have been unfamiliar with these earlier traditions or to have overlooked the significant differences between these works and those which were being manufactured in Abomey at the time of his visit. Not only is the casting technique new, but in the course of time, materials, scale, subject matter, and creative approach changed dramatically. Whereas nineteenth-century works were made primarily of silver, post-conquest examples generally were made of brass. Descriptions of the nineteenth-century examples in Skertchly, Forbes, and Burton, and extant examples of these works, also suggest that in contrast to the miniature works done in this century, earlier examples frequently were large in size?some were over six feet in height.13 Subject matter also has changed over time. Whereas most of the pre-conquest metal arts represented royal themes (praise names and symbols), later works more frequently showed scenes from everyday and ceremonial life. In addition to these specific shifts, there also have been changes in the larger corpus which resulted in fewer innovations. Traditionally, most of the metal sculptures seem to have been one-of-a-kind examples; in this century, the bulk of the works have a mass-produced quality, showing similar forms and subjects.14 What accounts for the striking differences between the pre-conquest and post-conquest Dahomey arts? Change in the local patronage base was one decisive factor. In the 1930s when Herskovits was in Abomey not only was there no king on the throne, but local governance had been shifted to colonially appointed Canton chiefs, with a corresponding dispersal of power. To fill the patronage vacuum left by the removal of the king there were these Canton heads, as well as a growing number of tourists. Whereas traditionally the metal sculptures and cloth appliqu?s were made primarily for the king and the royal religious 12. Edna Bay cites (1985: 27) a family history of the royal smithing family (the Hontondji) to the effect that the technique of lost wax casting was learned by one of their family members from Europeans living in Ouidah only in the 1890s. Members of the Hontondji family in turn traveled to France in the early years of this century to perfect the casting art. Herskovits for his part notes that there is no evidence for the independent invention of casting at Abomey (1938 II: 354). 13. Herskovits's labeling of the silver and brass casters as "jewelers," that is, makers of essentially miniature and decorative arts, confirms his misinformation concerning the earlier sculptural forms that they made. 14. This Herskovits also noted (1938 II: 358), as he observed (ibid.: 356) that "it is quite possible that in the days of the kingdom the silver-work of these jewelers was more important than their brass figures."</page><page sequence="6">130 RES 16 AUTUMN 88 - '* '''"liili??

Dahomey royal scepters (makpo) of King Behanzin (1889-1894) (published in Adolphe Badin, Jean Baptiste Blanchard au Dahomey: Journal de la Campagne par un Marsouin, Paris, 1895, p. 253). organizations, after the fall of the kingship these works began to be sold much more widely. In the 1930s, as Herskovits himself notes, metal and appliqu? arts could be bought by anyone who could afford them. Herskovits suggests in addition that there was a popular market for the castings in Nigeria (1938 II: 358). This shift in patronage undoubtedly was of considerable importance vis-?-vis the changes manifested in these arts. The shift in materials (from expensive silver to less expensive brass), in scale (from large works to miniature portable items), in subject matter (from royal themes to scenes documenting everyday and ceremonial life), and in creative aims (from one-of-a kind sculptures to mass-produced works) are a reflection of this change in patronage. There are also a number of important types of early artistic forms from Dahomey that Herskovits does not discuss. He mentions the well-known Dahomey iron asen memorials (fig. 6) only in passing, in the context of ceremonies (1938 I: 204, II: 59).15 The famous recades (makpo) (fig. 7) and thrones also are noted only briefly (1938 II: 312; II: 363) as symbols of rank and succession.16 Herskovits also appears not to have known about the great early masterpieces of Dahomey wood carving, for he writes that except for a short passage in Burton, there is little if any evidence of earlier Fon wood carving traditions (1938 II: 367-368).17 This is somewhat surprising since the 15. For an in-depth discussion of asen, see Edna Bay's Assen: Iron Altars of the Fon People of Benin (1985). 16. For an analysis of Dahomey makpo traditions, see Adande 1962. 17. According to Herskovits (1938 II: 367), "nowhere in the earlier writings and rarely in the later works are any descriptions of wood-carvings or any recognition of the place of carved wooden figures in Dahomean culture, to be encountered." The only exception to this statement, he notes, is a quotation from Burton to several "wee wooden goddities." In fact, however, there are numerous references in these early sources to the presence of wooden</page><page sequence="7">Blier: Melville ). Herskovits and the arts of ancient Dahomey 131 famous life-sized wooden king figures that General Dodds brought out of Dahomey at the time of the conquest were published by Waterlot in 1926 (a book that Herskovits cites in his bibliography). Along with the equally important iron warrior sculpture (also overlooked by Herskovits), these works were on display at the Mus?e du Trocadero in Paris (figs. 8, 9). In this collection18 Herskovits could have seen not only these impressive sculptures but also the famous palace doors, the thrones of Glele and Guezo, numerous "recades" (makpo staffs), and hundreds of other Dahomey works collected by the French before or soon after the conquest. Since Herskovits overlooks these arts and fails to note essential differences between the early and later objects, he misses a key distinguishing element of Dahomey artistic production?the extraordinary ?nnovativeness of the pre-conquest Dahomey arts. The nineteenth-century Dahomey art corpus includes an extraordinary number of one-of-a-kind images. Accounts of this period indicate that even over a relatively short period of time, many new forms were invented. In addition to the unique metal warrior figures, in the Fondation Dapper and the Mus?e de l'Homme collections, the life-size wooden king figures, and various hammered silver and brass sculptures in European and American collections (fig. 5), writers of this period describe such unusual works as a six-foot tall silver stork, a silver ostrich with real eggs under each wing, a five foot-high silver tree, a crow, a sheep, a dog, and a monkey climbing a tree, a large wooden horned eagle, a gigantic wooden horse on wheels, a wooden mule, a wooden model of a fort, an iron figure of a man turning a windmill, a full-scale glass coach, two silver ships, and a twenty-foot-long wooden model ship complete with sails.19 The nonroyal bocio sculptures (fig. 10) also show extraordinary ?nnovativeness and diversity. Although it is difficult with these bocio works to get a perspective on changes through time, each is clearly an individualized assemblage of diverse elements. The uniqueness of so many of these Dahomey objects becomes especially striking when we contrast it with the nearby traditions of Yoruba and Benin. There a much greater emphasis on consistency, and continuity is maintained within groups of image types. E. H. Gombrich has noted (1968) that there are parallels between certain kinds of societies and their arts. Some, he suggests, tend toward conservatism and value craftsmanship and refined artistic forms. (Yoruba and Benin might be considered as exemplifying this model.) Others are more dynamic; they emphasize the innovative, even if it means that the work is sometimes less skilled. Dahomey clearly conforms more closely to this latter model. As suggested above, a large number of their art works are distinctively one-of-a-kind, and careful craftsmanship does not always appear to be of Figure 8.

Skertchly, for example, mentions or describes wooden sculptures in Dahomey almost a dozen times in the course of his 1874 account (pp. 189, 191, 204, 254, 260-261, 266, 287, 354, 398, 410) and illustrates two of these works?a wooden elephant fixed to the ridge of a pole (p. 189) and a large figure (p. 353). 18.

This feature of Dahomey art, which is one of its most significant attributes, is entirely overlooked by Herskovits because of the synchronie emphasis in his writing, because of his lack of familiarity with the wealth of arts collected at the time of the conquest, and because his research focused on the late, mass-produced tourist arts that proliferated in Abomey in the 1930s. Princely and popular: class distinctions in Dahomey artistic expression Dahomey society, Herskovits explains (1938 I: 99-101), is highly stratified, comprising several differentiated classes: slaves (made up primarily of war captives), free individuals, and nobles. Herskovits's discussion of class raises a number of questions, because status in Dahomey society rarely was transferred from one generation to the next. This generation's war prisoner might be next generation's court minister, and next generation's farmer might be this generation's prince.20 Dahomey class structure thus is very different from that in either the pre-modern East or West, where class is imbued with a continuity that often gives it castelike features. Furthermore, it may be more accurate to say that Dahomey recognizes one primary division within the society?that between the king and everybody else?rather than having distinct classes. It is equally true, however, to say that the number of Dahomey social divisions was limitless? everyone in the society (including the king) had persons who were his or her superiors and inferiors. The point that Herskovits raises with respect to artists and class (however one wishes to define the term class) nonetheless needs serious consideration. Artists, according to Herskovits (1938 I: 101), are all taken from the middle "free person" class. His emphasis on a sharp division of labor with respect to the arts is central to his concern with showing the similarities between artistic traditions in Africa and Europe (1938 II: 314). The fact is that Dahomey artists often were not from this "class" at all. Many artists were either war prisoners (the political equivalent of slaves) or royalty. Thus, for example, the smith who forged the already mentioned iron warrior figure now in the Mus?e de l'Homme (fig. 9) was a prisoner who was brought to Abomey from a Mahi community to the north. This artist, a smith named Akati Akpele Kendo, was captured near Dassa Zoume in the early nineteenth century.21 His iron warrior figure was commissioned by King Glele for the memorial ceremonies of his father, King Guezo, to honor Guezo's victory over the Mahi people. Like the life-size wooden king figures, this sculpture served as a memorial to the late king. Like Akati, other war prisoners who were skilled in various arts were similarly set up in pre-established artist compounds in and around Abomey. Through these foreign war prisoners, important new imagery, ideas, and styles were introduced into the corpus of Dahomey art. Many other Dahomey artists were of royal blood. The Hontondji family members who created (and still create) the various brass and silver works (figs. 4, 5) share the same lineage as the king, tracing their kinship ties back to the time of the kingdom's founder, Wegbadja.22 So, too, the artist who carved the wooden anthropomorphic king figures in the Mus?e de l'Homme (fig. 8); a man by the name of Sosa Adede Likohe is said to have been the son of the late eighteenth-century king, Agonglo (fig. 2), who ruled between 1789 and 1797. Forbes may be referring to Hontondji and Sosa Adede Likohe when he writes (1851 II: 38) that "lest we should not fully appreciate [the king's] supposed wealth, Hootoojee [Huntondji] and the king's artisan brother were seated in our vicinity to explain the value of the various articles." Sosa Adede, who was also known as Da Atinkpato ("lord" carver), lived in a compound next to the private palace of King Agonglo.23 He received special 20. Frequently, the sons of the reigning king were set up in rural areas outside the capital. Many of their children in turn became farmers. During the reign of King Guezo (1818-1858), class structure in Dahomey became somewhat more rigid as he began naming supportive princes (who had helped in his coup d'?tat against his predecessor Adandozan) to key ministerial positions. This effectively blocked one of the main avenues of traditional status elevation for nonroyals. 21. Interviews with Gunon Akati, July 11, 1984, and July 21, 1986. 22. Edna Bay (n.d. p. 7) points out that the Hontondji family came from Aliada to the Abomey plateau during the reign of Agaja (1708-1740) and in the course of time was encouraged to assume various royal prerogatives. Like Wegbadja, the first Dahomey king, the Hontondji ancestors were originally from Tado, and hence the kings referred to them as "brothers." 23. This information is based on conversations (both on May 8, 1986) with Pascal Sosa Dede (one of this artist's descendants) and Asogbahu Agonglo, an elder who today lives in the Sosa Dede compound. Robert Farris Thompson (1983: 169) was the first scholar to identify this famous nineteenth-century carver. He gives his name as Sosandande Likohin Kankanhau.</page><page sequence="9">Blier: Melville J. Herskovits and the arts of ancient Dahomey 133 permission from the king to build a high, palace-size enclosing wall around his compound so that he could work in privacy. Sosa Dede's descendants still live in this compound. In view of the important place of these royal wood carvers and silversmiths as court artists, it is somewhat surprising to read Herskovits's statement that artists were accorded low status in this culture. Of the wood carver he writes (1938 II: 365) that he "is regarded as a 'man of the bush' and hence of little consequence. ..." Herskovits notes with apparent surprise (1938 II: 364) an incident in which a chief had carved a bocio figure himself (rather than commissioning a work from a professional wood carver).24 In amplifying on the condition of the carver, he notes (1938 II: 365) that the amateur carver, particularly if he be a man of position, must conceal his creative drive if he is to retain the respect of his subordinates. Furthermore?and this is a point stressed by the Dahomeans who discussed the subject?a man who accepts a commission from another is, insofar as he is retained by the one who has given his commission, the employee of the other. And for a man of position to be at the beck and call of anyone who might give him an order for a statuette . . . would entail a loss of dignity for himself, and those of his family, living and dead, associated with him in the collectivity. My evidence, however, suggests that carving (and the Figure 9. Dahomey iron warrior figure dedicated to King Guezo (1818-1858). Artist: Akati Akpele Kendo, 1858-1868. h. 165 cm. Mus?e de l'Homme. Captain Gonssagrives gift, 1894. (Swo.d missing.) accompanying recompense for the work) was not a priori a low-status occupation. Indeed, not only was King Agonglo's son a carver (and a famous one at that), but King Agonglo himself is said to have carved his own throne.25 As with Herskovits's three-part class 24. This Abomey noble (possibly Prince Rene Aho) sought to conceal the fact that he was a carver because persons of his status were not supposed to be artisans. According to Herskovits (1938 II: 364): An instructive example was had in an incident which occurred in the course of this field-work. An attempt was made on one occasion to acquire two remarkably fine gbo in the form of carved human figures from the compound of the chief of an important Abomey collectivity. The chief refused to part with them because of the good fortune they had brought his compound and his family, but offered to have reproductions made. Shortly after, it was learned that this head of the extended family had asked a friend to allow him to take a piece of dried hardwood that happened to lie on his land. When surprise was expressed that a man of his rank should concern himself with the details of getting proper wood for a pair of statuettes which he had ordered made by a carver, it was learned that this chief was himself to carve them. Significantly, however, it was suggested that this fact had best not be revealed. The reasons for this are not clear, but if the carver was Prince Rene Aho, there may have been a political reason to hide his carving abilities. The making of gbo (bo) (in the form of 6oc/'o figurai carvings or in some other form) is prohibited to those who have been enthroned as princes or family heads. 25.

King</page><page sequence="10">134 RES 16 AUTUMN 88 division for Dahomey, the focus here on a marked division of labor in the arts suggests that European models may have influenced Herskovits in his writing about these traditions. The assumption of European models for Dahomey art posed other problems for Herskovits as well, particularly with respect to the issue of the function of art. Most significant is his claim (1938 II: 313-314) to have found, in Dahomey, a tradition of "art for art's sake." He writes (1938 I: 98) that the metal arts "have, as their principal function, the decoration of the houses of men of position." Later he adds (1938 II: 314) that "the brass figures [were] acquired by those who can afford to possess them for the pleasure of seeing these objects of beauty about in their dwellings, [and] furnish a psychological parallel to a painting or a piece of sculpture in western civilization." 26 What Herskovits is referring to here, however, is primarily a late (and tourist-based) feature of Dahomey arts. If traditionally these arts had been identified essentially as secular works and were, as Herskovits suggests (1938 II: 315), intended solely to "enhance the surroundings in which the king moved," they would be quite unique in Africa. During the time of the kingship, these arts seem instead to have had a decidedly nonsecular character. According to several people I interviewed,27 the early metal arts (that is, the precursors of the cire-perdue castings), rather than being purely decorative, played an important role in the royal ancestral association, Nesuhwe. These sculptures, with their frequently strong name imagery, served as memorials for the deceased kings in much the same way that the Benin head and altar figures and the Kuba ndop figures functioned as memorial sculptures.28 An illustration in Skertchly shows a royal temple belonging to Crown Prince Ahanhanzo (Hahansu) (fig. 11) in which a number of these sculptures are found along with various asen. In their public display in the parades of the annual royal memorial ceremonies ("customs"), such works reinforced the power and religious sanctity of the ruler and underscored the viability of the kingship itself. Herskovits's discussion of artistic personality also needs some clarification29 with respect to European models and political issues. Of particular importance in this light is his characterization of the wood carvers as unstable and distinguished by aberrant behavior (1938 II: 364-365). In his words (II: 364) these professional wood-carvers are . . . regarded in a manner corresponding to the stereotype of the artist in European culture. . . . That such a person deviates strongly from the accepted patterns of sanctioned conduct in the highly organized society of Dahomey must be obvious, and . . . this fact makes for an ambivalent attitude toward the art of wood-carving. . . . It seems likely that the aberrant behavior that Herskovits identified with wood carvers may have had a political and economic basis. That this is the case is given credence by his discussion of the hesitancy of carvers to work for the palace. He notes (1938 II: 363) in this light that when the King commanded a [wood-carving] artist to produce something in a week, it did not follow that the command was heeded. Rather it was . . . necessary to Agonglo, "the artist king," however, is credited with an active role in the creation process. The situation with respect to Dahomey kings and art thus seems to be less a case of dilettantism such as was practiced by European and Eastern aristocracy than one in which royalty were actively involved in the creative regeneration and growth of the state, whether on the field of battle, in the bedroom, or in the production of art. 26. Herskovits goes on to note (1938 II: 314) that "in similar fashion the appliqu?d caps worn by the chiefs may be contrasted with the wall-hangings which adorn the homes of chiefs, but which are put to no practical use. . . ." This follows a similar Herskovits assertion (1938 II: 314) that "the useful and non-useful forms of art, then, may be logically conceived as paralleling the forms of pure and applied art in Western European tradition." 27. Da Mivede (interview, December 19, 1985); Da Abadassi (interview, January 13, 1986). 28. It was in this context of royal memorials, in turn, that these sculptures were paraded in the annual royal memorial rites ("customs") described by early European travelers to the Fon court. The incorporation of similar sculptures into the royal assen (memorial sculptures) and djexo fin?ais reflects a related facet of this memorial theme. While Herskovits notes (I: 207) that "figures of all kinds of metal ? gold, silver, and brass?are given to celebrate the installation of newly deified spirits of the ancestors," he did not develop this information into an understanding of the traditional function of these metal objects. 29. Also in need of clarification is Herskovits's view of the economic insignificance of these wood carvings. He notes (I: 77) in this regard that "most of the carving [is] produced outside the economic field. . . ." Fon wood carvings have, in reality, considerable and multiple significance. A number of families? particularly in communities outside of the center of Abomey? possessed examples of these carvings that were intimately bound up with Dahomey religion, healing practices, protective measures, self expression, and so on. Besides, Fon wood carvings appear even today to have a relatively significant place in the local economy. They are purchased in places as far away as Lome (Togo). In the Be market in Lome, I found that three of the six traditional art and herbal merchants were from Abomey and carried primarily Abomey carvings and medicinal products.</page><page sequence="11">Blier: Melville J.

Skertchly, Dahomey As It Is, 1874, London, p. 463). bring the artist to Abomey under arrest and confine him under guard with his wood and tools provided him, until what was required was . . . finished. While Herskovits suggests that this situation illustrates the wood carvers' lack of professionalism and instability, in fact it highlights both the power of the royalty and the potential animosity between the king and those who were obliged to work for him. This view also indicates Herskovits's tendency to accept the royal perspective on such issues. Any number of other factors, such as lack of previous payment, prior commitments, family responsibilities, or agricultural needs, could have been at play.30 The bocio figures that constituted an important part of the wood carvers' production also are of interest in the context of Dahomey politics. Constructed of wood, skulls, iron bits, rope, feathers, gourds, shells, cloth, leaves, and other local materials, these sculptures (figs. 10, 12) reflect the dominant concerns and limited resources associated primarily with the common people of the community. Some in their Janus imagery stand ever vigilant, watching for danger at the crossroads or compound entrances. Others, in the prominent themes of bondage, silencing, aggression, and danger, reflect supernatural powers?powers that can enable even those of humble birth to gain benefits from others of equal or higher status. The bocio sculptures, in their psychological power, roughness, and emphasis on sacrificial materials, contrast with the physical might, finish, and sense of refinement reflected in the royal art forms. Although Herskovits lauds (1953: 118) his mentor Franz Boas for rejecting what he calls a "simplistic [economically determined] explanation of social phenomena . . .," he himself, by overlooking important political factors in Dahomey artistic expression, missed some of their essential features. Associated with the question of Dahomey politics and art is our third issue, that of Dahomey cultural unity. The concept of culture: is there a unified cultural base for Dahomey art? In the course of his career, Herskovits became closely associated with issues and theoretical concerns regarding the definition of culture. The summary and concluding chapter of his Man and His Works (1947) provides an in-depth exposition of his theory of culture, which is also relevant to his thinking on cultural relativism.31 Two points he raises are of particular importance to his interpretation of Dahomey art. These are his statements (1947: 637-639) that (1) culture is variable and (2) culture exhibits regularities that permit its analysis by the methods of science. Of the two, it is primarily the unity of Dahomey culture that is emphasized by Herskovits in his writings on ancient Dahomey.32 In this light he suggested (1938 I: 10) that 30. Herskovits's assertion that Dahomey women do not want to marry wood carvers because of their instability, their lack of conscientiousness, and their nonchalance with respect to productivity (II: 365) thus seems rather biased. 31. See James Fernandez (in press). 32. Ottenberg (personal communication, February 5, 1987) notes that there was also his wish to show that other cultures were systematically organized and not things of shreds and patches.

Dahomey bocio figure (published in Alexandre d'Alb?ca, La France Au Dahomey, Paris, 1895, p. 17). throughout the considerable area that Dahomey kings had brought into their empire the people represent a unit, both culturally and ethnically. . . . There can be no question that minor differences exist today, as they did exist, between the cultures of the various peoples who comprised the Dahomean state. There are differences in speech, but these are of a dialectic character; differences in religious belief, but merely in the names of deities or the emphasis placed on a particular deity; and so for all phases of culture. There is, however, considerable evidence that refutes this idea of Dahomey cultural uniformity. Indeed, while Herskovits suggests (1938 1:11) that in the city-states of Allada, Whydah, and Abomey "Dahomean culture may be observed in its purest form," in reality each of these areas had a different language and predominant culture: Whydah is Hweda and Adja; the people of Aliada are Aizo; and the residents of Abomey are Gedevi-Fon. Although these regions do show similarities, originally they were distinct and independent political and cultural groupings. Furthermore, even within the Abomey plateau, where Herskovits suggests (1938 I: 10) the "true" Dahomey is found, a number of cultures exist simultaneously. Not only are there at least two autochthonous groups represented here (Agblomenu and Gedevi, as Herskovits himself notes [1938 I: 102]), but throughout the period of Fon expansion in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, large numbers of foreigners came to live in various settlements in and around Abomey. Some of these foreigners (the Hausa, for example) came independently and played important roles as traders. Others?Mahi and Yoruba, especially?were brought in as war prisoners. They became in many respects the economic backbone of the kingdom, since the men not sold into slavery served as laborers (working as farmers, smiths, artists, and warriors). As suggested above, because of these foreign individuals, many Dahomey arts show striking iconographie and stylistic parallels with Yoruba and Mahi forms. The women war prisoners, for their part, were often given in marriage to court officials or were employed as palace servants, many of the latter adding to the king's coffers through their spinning and dyeing of cloth. A number of the captured foreign women joined the king's harem. Some became the mothers of the king's children;33 others formed part of the famous female military troops that went to war in the king's name. The mixed and foreign character of Abomey was also actively promoted by the kings in their encouragement of visitors to the court. Thus there were ambassadors from Asante and other states, and a court minister was assigned to look after the welfare of these and other visiting dignitaries. Furthermore, during the annual "customs" rites, high-ranking foreign dignitaries residing in Dahomey, including representatives from the various European trading firms, were required to come to Abomey to attend the festivities. In some years it took several months for the full ceremonies to be completed. In these various ways the kings continually unities. . . . Also, no one was talking much about conflict and aggression in anthropology at the time. There was not even a subfield of political anthropology then. 33. Because no Dahomey king could be the son of a local royal princess, many of the mothers of the Dahomey kings were foreigners.</page><page sequence="13">Blier: Melville J. Herskovits and the arts of ancient Dahomey 137 reinforced the cosmopolitan character and identity of the Abomey capital and court. These diverse foreigners left their mark on Dahomey art and culture. Many brought gifts, the form and imagery of which influenced local models. The Dahomey kings also drew on royal imagery and art forms identified with the rulers of powerful opposing states. The royal thrones seem to have been modeled on Asante prototypes; the Dahomey crown appears based on Yoruba examples; the court robes showed parallels with northern Yoruba traditions; the sandals have Hausa features. Furthermore, the foreign women in the harem were often responsible for introducing new religious beliefs into the court and indeed into the wider area around Abomey. Thus it was King Agaja's wife, Naye Wandjele (an Adja woman), who officially introduced the cults of Lisa, Mawu, Age, and Gu. The new beliefs that she and other royal women introduced in turn promoted the introduction of new art forms and imagery. The distinctive history of Dahomey culture, which emphasized social agglomeration, had a significant impact on its art. Dahomey art, like Dahomey society, is clearly syncretic. While many African cultures have seen a great amount of cultural and artistic integration in the course of dynastic conquests and migrations, what is in some respects unique about Dahomey is the manner in which this society went out of its way to foster the retention of foreign elements in its arts.34 The kings chose not to promote an official style or set of standard forms, but rather to emphasize the different exogenous traditions that they appropriated and wished to be identified with. The process of unifying diverse peoples into a common whole was of course not restricted to Dahomey, but few other kingdoms, empires, and states have adopted such a systematic policy of artistic assimilation. This quality of glorying in the cultural diversity of the state and its allies seems to have led not only to the already mentioned incorporation of an enormous diversity of art forms, but also to what is perhaps one of Dahomey's most important artistic contributions?the art of assemblage. Nearly all Dahomey art forms are works of assemblage, in that they are made up of numerous separate parts, of the same or mixed media, joined together to form a single unit. The Dahomey concern for assemblage crosscuts media, periods, and class, impacting on style, technique, composition, and creative approach. From the wooden anthropomorphic king figures with their separately carved and attached arms (fig. 8), to the palace doors (with their numerous individually carved parts), the silver and brass animals and figures with their multiple hammered parts (fig. 5), the multimedia bocio sculptures with their added power symbols (figs. 10, 12), the earth and wooden armature Legba figures, and the cloth appliqu?s distinguished by their multicolored cut-outs (fig. 3), the dominance of assemblage in the arts of Dahomey is clear. Assemblage is an important element of Dahomey weaving traditions as well. As Herskovits notes (1938 I: 45-46), cloth woven of both raffia and cotton (fig. 13) "constitutes the finest Dahomean weaving, both from the point of view of technical excellence and of design. . . ." This concern for assemblage in the arts, I would suggest, parallels the Dahomey emphasis on cultural diversity. Through assemblage, the variant art traditions and peoples making up the state were both exalted and integrated. Interestingly, Dahomey is one of only two civilizations in Africa (the other being Kongo) that place a primacy on sculptural assemblage. The underlying factors influencing its importance in the art thus are of considerable interest. Herskovits, once more, in part because of his focus on Dahomey cultural uniformity, overlooks this central aspect of its art. Whereas Herskovits emphasizes (1938 I: 29) the "rigidity" of the Dahomey kingdom, its "consciously close organization of society" and its "centralized and absolute rule," the evidence reflected in the arts suggests instead that considerable freedom was allowed and encouraged.35 The value placed on artistic diversity, as expressed both in the extensive incorporation of foreign imagery and forms and in the pervasive emphasis on assemblage, suggests that this underlying factor of dissimilarity and flexibility played an important part in Dahomey forms of societal and artistic expression. Methodology and meaning in Dahomey art Three principal issues have been raised here as regards Herskovits's writing and research on Dahomey art?those of historical accuracy, class differentiation in the arts, and Dahomey cultural diversity. Herskovits's methodological orientations have bearing on each of these issues. Methodology was of critical importance to Herskovits as evidenced in his insistence on grounded fieldwork. To Herskovits (1947: 79), "The field is the 34. One also finds this to a certain extent with the Asante. 35. In both the official and unofficial histories of the kingdom, fluidity and flux appear to have been far more the norm than Herskovits suggests.</page><page sequence="14">138 RES 16 AUTUMN 88 9 ^^GiSSr Figure 13. Dahomey woman in local cloth (published in E. Chaudoin, Trois Mois de Captivit? au Dahomey, Paris, 1891, p. 311). children and on market days in particular the courtyard was a place of great activity. Relatively little information is provided by Herskovits about his selection of those who came to be interviewed by him. His principal interpreter and an important informant, however, was Prince Rene Aho, grandson of the late King Glele. Because Herskovits did not speak Fon, Rene Aho's role in the interview process was undoubtedly considerable. Information on Herskovits's interview techniques is also scanty. In some cases (as he and Frances note in Dahomean Narrative, 1958: 6-7): Our method of recording was to take the text directly on the typewriter as our interpreters translated the narrator's flow of the story, given in Fon. . . . [We] wrote in English. . . . The use of the typewriter brought out laboratory" in which all necessary data relevant to culture can be studied. Given these convictions, his period of residence in Dahomey was remarkably brief: he was in Africa less than five months and was actively involved in the Dahomey research for only about three and a half months.36 From this short research experience (whose duration appears to have been determined primarily by teaching obligations and a lack of available research funds),37 he was able to put together an enormous amount of material. If one adds to the documentation needed for the 710-page, two volume Dahomey, the material utilized in the 490-page Dahomean Narrative, and his numerous additional articles on Fon culture, Herskovits's productivity in the field was indeed remarkable. In his preface to Dahomey, Herskovits credits the richness of Dahomey culture and the significant role played by his wife, Frances, who accompanied him to the field, for the wealth of material he was able to gather in this short period of time. The fact that much had been previously written about Fon culture undoubtedly was also important. Herskovits's primary field method appears to have been an equally decisive factor in his productivity. Like many others of his era, Herskovits's main means of gathering information was through interviews carried out at his residence. As he states (1938 I: Hi): Our house ... of the unusual etage or 2-storied kind, . . . afforded privacy for long discussions with chiefs and commoners and descendants of slaves and with priests and laymen. The well in our courtyard also brought beneath our windows groups of women and 36. See Blier (in press). The field research done by Franz Boas, Melville Herskovits's teacher at Columbia, was also remarkably short. It should be noted, however, that Herskovits stressed to his own students the need for an extended period of fieldwork. Simon Ottenberg adds (personal communication, February 5, 1987) that of course, the pattern of much of American Indian research at the time was summer field trips between teaching, as there were few grants, sometimes repeated over a number of summers. By the time he was training students in field research at Northwestern the pattern of a year or more of field research in Africa had begun to be set by British social anthropologists, and though Herskovits abhorred their anthropological approach, he did not this element. 37. Walter Jackson notes in this light (1986: 106) that Herskovits fought very hard for research funds for "fundamental" field investigations in the late 1920s, but that the principal concerns of funding agencies at the time were with the problems of the contemporary American black. In addition, (ibid.: 110), because of teaching obligations at the time, much of Herskovits's fieldwork had to be done during summers.</page><page sequence="15">Blier: Melville J. Herskovits and the arts of ancient Dahomey 139 interesting reactions. At first, both teller and translator, watching the play of the machine with fascination, spoke on and on; some of the fullest tales were recorded under the influence of the novelty of having what was said taken on the typewriter. Later, when they were accustomed to the sound of the keys, they would on occasion attempt to confound [us] ... by talking rapidly ... to test our typing skill. ... At that time ... or later, when the script was read over, it was discussed with the interpreters. Where myths validating belief were involved, these discussions formed the basis for future conversations. Herskovits's actual field notebooks,38 however, indicate that the bulk of information he and Frances collected was written in what might be called "ethnographer's shorthand," that is, notes and brief comments, rather than as verbatim transcripts. Furthermore, Herskovits's dominant emphasis on interviews at home was carried out at the expense of firsthand observation. He relied heavily on secondary sources when it came to most ceremonies or art-associated activities. In the text of Dahomey, Herskovits makes a point of indicating those ceremonies that he was able to actually witness himself. There appear to have been fewer than a dozen, nearly all of which took place in the month of April, shortly after his arrival. What this means is that the bulk of Herskovits's data on religious ritual derives from secondary information. He states (1938 I: vii) in his preface to Dahomey that "the present work is purely descriptive," but his descriptions were largely based on what others reported to him. And, having witnessed very little of the ritual contexts in which the art was used, one questions whether he would have been able to evaluate adequately the information that his interviewees were giving to him. Herskovits's lack of extensive firsthand ceremonial observation also, I believe, has bearing on his numerous inaccuracies vis ?-vis the ritual objects, for he did not, by and large, see these works in the context of actual shrine settings or ceremonies. This lack of significant contextual data on the art makes one question the depth of knowledge that Herskovits could have had about these works. It is probably for this reason that in his explanation of these traditions he tends to fall back on Western artistic concepts, such as individual inspiration, deviant artistic personalities, and decorative works valued solely for their beauty.39 As noted earlier, however, these conclusions are very problematic. Another methodological problem raised in Herskovits's fieldwork concerns his choice of primary interpreter and informant. As has been noted, Herskovits's principal interpreter was Prince Rene Aho, grandson of the much feared late-nineteenth-century king, Glele.40 Glele's descendants today, as in the time of Herskovits, are considered among the principal pretenders to the throne. Prince Aho appears to have provided Herskovits with a considerable amount of data about Dahomey. As Herskovits states (1938 I: iv), Rene Aho "could draw tellingly on the advantages of his social position to bring us significant information. . . ." Yet there were also problems with Rene Aho's perspective, as Frances Herskovits herself noted in the unpublished diary excerpts:41 "From Rene quite naturally too, we got an over-idealized picture of the bounty of the king in settling a dispute between two villages." Some of the problems derive from the fact that it was Prince Rene Aho who served as the principal intermediary in Abomey. Herskovits notes in the preface to Dahomey (1938 I: iv) that Rene Aho had a decisive part in choosing those who would come to the house to be interviewed. He also helped to determine what ceremonies would be witnessed. In part for this reason, the great majority of the religious events that Herskovits saw were royal. As he notes (I: iv), "practically all branches of the family of Glele were visited. Ceremonies were witnessed at the compounds of most of these chiefs. . . ."42 38. The unpublished field notes of Herskovits are analyzed by the author in "Field Days: Melville J. Herskovits in Dahomey," History in Africa: A Journal of Method (in press). 39. Herskovits seems also to have been concerned with portraying African art in a way that made it in every way comparable with European artistic traditions. See also note 26. 40. Edna Bay offers more information about Rene Aho (personal communication, December 15, 1986): After the Herskovits' departure, Rene Aho became a central authority around Abomey who worked with any number of visiting scholars, dignitaries, filmmakers and the like. He wrote several articles, possibly under Herskovits' or somebody else's inspiration or simply in hopes of being recognized for what he was ? an extremely knowledgeable source on Fon culture. Yes, he was of the royal line and used that to his advantage, but at least by the early seventies when I knew him, he also had legitimate contacts with [temples] of the so-called popular gods and was an excellent contact for getting to know religious leadership in the environs of Abomey. 41. Northwestern University Library, Special Collections, Melville J. Herskovits Archives. Box 163, bundle 4, card no. 125. 42. Edna Bay notes (personal communication, December 15, 1986) that "curiously, many of the royal ceremonies that Herskovits</page><page sequence="16">140 RES 16 AUTUMN 88 Having Rene Aho as Herskovits's principal translator may have presented further difficulties with respect to interviews involving individuals who were not members of the royal family. Herskovits himself alluded (1938 I: 103) to these problems. He notes in this light that on visiting a former slave village not far from Abomey, the manner in which the people scurried to their houses, frightened at the approach of strangers, spoke volumes, as did the behavior of the head-man who, with deep ob?issance and with great timidity, came to pay his respects to those descendants of the royal family who were present. On the other hand, the attitude of the members of the entourage of nobles of the old regime . . . took on an imperiousness . . . that was never manifested in their attitudes toward members of their own class. The intimidating presence of Rene Aho and the memories of the life-death power that the Dahomey kings historically had over the wider population undoubtedly had impact on those who came to be interviewed. Indeed, even though Herskovits indicates that a number of nonroyal persons were contacted by him, since they were interviewed in the presence of Prince Rene Aho (and were translated by him) there is an obvious question as to the reliability of the information obtained. The fact that the site of most of these interviews was Herskovits's home, a two-story structure, also would have been intimidating. Traditionally, two-story structures were reserved exclusively for the king.43 On balance, it should be emphasized that many of these methodological shortcomings also mar the writings of other scholars of the period. Many anthropologists at the time relied on a single well placed "informant," conducted most of the interviews at home, and spent far less time observing ceremonies and everyday life than noting down descriptions of them by others. The prevailing synchronism in Herskovits's writing is also characteristic of many studies of this period. Although he was, at least in theory, more cognizant than some of the importance to a culture of its history, nonetheless Herskovits overlooked considerable evidence of change?artistic change, in particular?in Dahomey. The second issue that was discussed here, Herskovits's failure to include a discussion of class imperatives in relation to art, also partially derives from his methodological orientations. In his emphasis on the unity of Dahomey culture, Herskovits tended to overlook the effect of the larger social factors?such as kingship and shifting stratification?which significantly impacted on the perceptions of different members of the society. This oversight led him to miss key distinctions in the arts; it also led to his uncritical acceptance of Prince Rene Aho as his primary interpreter, source, and intermediary.44 In part because of this decision, his discussion of both the royal and the nonroyal arts suffers from considerable bias and misinformation. Because Herskovits did not seek out adequately either the history of the early Dahomey arts and their traditional functioning or the full contextual setting of these arts at the time of his research, he could not question critically the information that was being supplied to him through his princely informant. Herskovits's preconceptions concerning Dahomey cultural homogeneity, the third issue that was addressed here, also led to the misreading of these arts in a significant way. Like many of his contemporaries, Herskovits saw culture as essentially unified. Internal cultural differences, accordingly, were seen to be far less important than the similarities that the members of this culture embraced. As we have seen, however, in the case of the Dahomey, the kingdom was a composite one made up of a diversity of cultures. Whereas Herskovits emphasized the cultural similarities within the Dahomey kingdom, the evidence? including that provided by the arts?indicates that the differences were equally if not more important. Indeed it is in many respects the great diversity of Dahomey society that gives Dahomey art its distinctive character. It is this diversity that contributes to the art's great ?nnovativeness, its powerfully juxtaposed royal and commoner themes, its dominant concern with foreign adaptations, and its predominant emphasis on assemblage. It is through this diversity that Dahomey art derives both its uniqueness and its great visual strength. described took place at the Behanzins, who were rivals of the Ahos. Thus it is very probable that Herskovits had another contact among the Behanzins." 43. Kings Akaba, Agadja, and Guezo each had palaces of this type. The elaborate atto structures that were built in the course of the yearly royal ceremonies were also two-story units. 44. Simon Ottenberg remarks (personal communication, February 5, 1987) that "it does not surprise me that he accepted the royal perspective so readily. He liked to associate with important people. . . . Perhaps also his association with royalty reflected his wish to show that after all there were important people in Africa as well as in other parts of the world."</page><page sequence="17">Blier: Melville J.
