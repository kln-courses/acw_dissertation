<plain_text><page sequence="1">9 The Human Landscape: Subjective Symbolism in Oscar Bluemner 's Painting Frank Gettings In the collection of Oscar Bluemner material at the Archives of American Art in Washington there are notebooks, painting diaries, and jottings on odd scraps of paper that are a testimony to this artist's persistent search for ideas and information about the aesthetics and the craft of painting. These notes reveal that the motifs that most often people his landscapes, houses and trees, were not only meant as strong visual statements, but were also purposely composed and painted by the artist to represent and communicate intense per- sonal emotions and moods. And, al- though Bluemner's works have been represented in museums and galleries for many years, until quite recently, the relation of the man to his work has re- mained relatively unknown. This year the Hirshhom Museum and Sculpture Garden, in Washington, D. C., held an exhibition of fifty-eight of his paintings, watercolors, and drawings in its collec- tion which has helped bring the achieve- ments of this artist into focus. Oscar Bluemner (1867-1938) emi- grated to America from Germany in 1892.1 He had been trained as an archi- tect, but had also developed, as an avo- cation, an interest in landscape drawing. In America he pursued his profession for almost twenty years with a mixture of success and of economic difficulty, the latter directly due to the crash of 1894 and by the duplicity of an asso- ciate who, in 1902, tried to cheat him out of a commission. And then, in 1911, Bluemner was greatly impressed by an exhibition of C6zanne's watercolors at Alfred Stieglitz' Photo-Secession Gallery in New York. In 1912, he decided to abandon the practice of architecture and to study art in Europe for half a year. There he was drawn to works being cre- ated under the influence of European modermism, and was greatly encouraged in his new career by the favorable re- views two exhibitions of his work re- ceived in Germany. Toward the end of 1912, he returned to New York just in time to be represented in the 1913 Armory Show, to which he contributed five paintings. From the beginning, in his earliest drawings and continuing throughout his life, landscapes were Bluemner's most persistent form of expression. But even his earliest notes reveal that he had an aversion to imitating nature in form and color, feeling that this was too pho- tographic and impersonal: "Sheeler's mistake red Philadelphia hses [houses] = colorphoto." 2 In about 1914 the forms in his paintings became more simplified and bolder. He believed that when he sublimated the photographic and illu- sionary aspects in his work he tended to draw attention to the attitudes or moods of the forms in his painting: "Painting must now proceed from realistic imper- sonal .., to individual expressive, there- fore symbolistic interpretation." 3 Bluemner wanted his motifs and color to express mood with the selfsame in- tensity he had experienced when paint- ing the picture. Nevertheless, pure ab- stract forms did not attract him, because he did not feel they could convey per- sonal moods or emotions-"Picabia and Kandinsky's errors."4 But, while his natural and material landscape motifs remained recognizable, they did suffer a sea-change, becoming somewhat ab- stracted when he simplified line, color, tone, and composition in a process he called "deformation." 5 "I must give to it and them such pictorial form or 'de- formation' ... which exactly corre- sponds to the peculiar sensation I ex- perience .." 6 Whatever the shapes in his landscapes represented in reality was no longer important. His intent was to impose his own "human" expressive pattern on these forms, so that they Frank Gettings is Associate Curator for Prints and Drawings at the Hirshhom Mu- seum and Sculpture Garden in Washington.

It is possible that Bluemner became so involved in his self-sustained, imag- inary world of human moods and spiri- tual values that it became a substitute for the stimuli of the real world. In 1924 he writes, '"The problem is so difficult that the painter ignoring and sacrificing all other pleasures of reading or of music, of society or finance, must find every substitute of them in his constant thought and toil of painting. It is there- foor [sic] that in a painting the whole of the personality is expressed."17 Since Bluemner's paintings contained his moods as described by form and since he identified more and more with those forms, it is not surprising to read the following from 1929; "-To render a scene as if it were a person ... and all such turns ego, landscape painting is semi-self portraiture."'8 Several years later, in 1932, he is more specific: "We see and carry our moods into scenes i.e. colors, then we may carry our lines, gestures, poses, shapes, action, forms, physiognomies into a scene." 9 It seems then a natural extension of Bluemner's architectural training that he should choose to make the house or groups of houses one of the two major forms in his work. He appears to support this choice of motif in the suggestion, written in 1912, that, since architectural structures are the product of man, they could serve to represent a man or groups of men.10 Houses had individuality; they also had clear lines, solid mass, and ver- tical planes. "All forms human by anal- ogie [sic]," he noted.11 And by inference, all forms were capable of expressing human personality. A sheet of sketches from about 1915 illustrates an early attempt to substitute architectural shapes for human forms (fig. 1). Four of the five pencil sketches represent well-known etchings by Rem- brandt. And, although three of these rep- resent crowd scenes, while the fourth is a self-portrait, all have been effectively transliterated into the geometric forms of the alphabet of architecture. Rem- brant's Self-Portrait is now a large, gab- led house; Christ Healing the Sick has become a dominant house surrounded by a cluster of smaller structures; and Descent From the Cross is now a com- position of house and tree. These sketches were probably exercises in an- alysis of the compositions of an old master, yet Bluemner's use of the angu- lar houses suggests a form with which he was most comfortable. Before he left on his European trip in 1912, Bluemner wrote about a deeply subjective experience that foreshadowed his own gradual involvement and identi- fication with the house form he would eventually call ego. In an attempt to save a watercolor that was not turning out well, he intensified the color. He found the resulting image so powerful that, "the things in their color ... make the scene speak for me." He continued, rather emotionally, '" am the sky . . . I am the mountain ... I am a house ... of my own shape and color, erected crude- Fig. 3. Oscar Bluemner, untitled sketch, 1914.

Often, but not always, it was painted a bright vermillion red (for which he earned the nickname "The Vermillion- aire"). He called it the ego and for him it represented man, sometimes with erotic overtones: "hard, red form (male) vs the softer, looser (female)." 13 Ac- tually, any "prominent vertically pre- ponderating [sic] form" 14 could be an ego form as long as it dominated as a mo- tif either in the center or to the side of the composition. Tall chimneys, towers, and silos also qualified, but ships' masts did not. That this form did have erotic sig- nificance for Bluemner is indicated by his occasional reference to it as a "phal- lus" line (fig. 2). Nevertheless the gabled house was his favorite form, while an- other was the rectilinear-walled "slab- sided" house. Several sheets of Bluem- net's notes focus on the characteristics of gabled houses and evaluated some as being better than others. Tall structures were the best, while the "squatty" wide or low house was of little value as far as he was concerned. Gables where the roof ridge was not in the center, producing a lopsided effect, were described by Bluem- ner as "useful characters." And windows in buildings were "eyes" which he used to further his intimation of human attri- butes (fig. 3). Very few of his drawings or paintings depict people-he once wrote that the absence of people would em- phasize the mystery and moods of his paintings 15-but by the twenties he had combined human forms and houses into a monistic whole that was able to ex- press whatever emotion he wished the ego to assume.16 The single house centered in the composition was called central ego and was, of course, the major form in the composition. When placed to the side, though still a major compositional form, these rectilinear structures were often used as a foil for Bluemner's other domi- nant motif, the tree, or as he called it, altera, and which, for him, seemed cast in the role of antagonist. Often colored green, this altera form came to represent the moods and emotions of women, con- trasting with the angular lines of ego. Bluemner researched the shapes of vari- ous kinds of trees and made notes on possible anthropomorphic and emotive qualities that could be used to convey mood. He described the birch as having clusters of leaves like hands and fingers; the acacia or the apple tree brought to mind umbrellas, fingers, and hair- brushes; and the red maple signified to him flames. And, although flowers do not often appear in his work, he felt moved to note the resemblance of dahlia petals to mules' ears.7 Nevertheless,</page><page sequence="6">13 these emotive qualities were so impor- tant to his painting that he felt (fig. 4) "unless a tree actually . . . resembled human forms it must be rendered with sought after resemblance." is Converse- ly, he accumulated, apparently as refer- ence material, illustrations of actors and dancers in various poses, clipped from magazines and newspapers, many of which have been overscored with crayon to show their tree-like affinities. In 1922 he wrote of the anthropomorphised tree, "A tree like a man, gesture lines, a living pulsating thing, limbs, eyes and breasts on trunks, sinews at roots." 19 By the twenties Bluemner had de- fined the roles of the house and the tree in his work, as male and female. Begin- ning with this period, many of his paint- ings and drawings were concerned with moods and emotions shared by men and women. Unfortunately, this was not as evident in his work as he might have thought at the time. In the mid-twenties the words ego and altera appear in his notes associated with his house and tree shapes.20 A sheet marked "Central Ego Motifs" (fig. 5) done in 1925 illustrates the juxtaposition of the forms with their labels surrounded by space. Notations in his painting diaries describing aspects of his compositions begin to include such phrases as "all human lines and planes ... ego and altera" and "a human altera stage scene." The small sketch of a tree and a house done in 1933 (fig. 6) is inscribed "Altera vs Wall" and implies a confrontation between a man and a woman. He wrote, "The ego feeling is in things, our mirror, the altera contem- plation is in space and far things, our polarity."'21 The tree had become an actress playing altera to his ego. A sheet dated 1935 describes the placement of his motifs in the explicit terms of the theatre.2 The house is now called actor and the tree is second actor (fig. 7). In a small note discussing a line of gabled houses, he observes that they look like a "line of singers or actor-danc- ers." 23 The spatial arrangement Bluem- ner calls central port is, of course, based on a theatre stage; "Take a choir of several actors, singers standing in a half circle. Now substitute houses, trees, etc. for the people and red, green and blue." 24 As it appeared in his paintings, the per- imeter of his "stage" was only roughly semi-circular and did not function as a stage as we know it. The houses and trees on the perimeter of the open space or body of water were the real actors. In his notes the artist describes one version that places the ego and the altera forms on opposite sides of the stage, leaving less important gabled houses or trees close to the back wall. He wrote that this was a "space for emotion" that was both intimate and intense.25 Spaces formed by alleys also fas- cinated Bluemner. They are discussed at length in his notes and are the subject of several of his paintings. For him, the curves and angles in the nar- row space of alleys created a sense of mystery and surprise with an intime mood. And, while in most of his com- positions space is enclosed, the alley, as he points out (fig. 8), "leads to an open space or insignificant back- ground." /2 On the other hand, Bluem- ner did not care for "super-human" mountains in his paintings, because they were out of scale with his usual motifs. Occasionally, however, he would use a cliff or rocky wall as one would a backdrop. He notes, "I am not inter- ested in unlyrical rocks or super-human mountain. At a small lyrical scale, human romantic, a cliff or rocky wall enlarges a gable, closes a road space, expands the color of house wall, repeats its slab forms, solidifies the background under a blue sky, is a ver- tical figure symbolizing [the work of] man better than fertile plains, as painting element, but otherwise than a secondary implement, it is a useless neutral thing opposed to human land- Fig. 6.

His opin- ions as to their function are not always clearly stated or consistent, but their sheer volume allows one to sense much of what he meant. In an early painting diary he writes, 'Life is short and with- out a system in everything ... time and energy is sacrificed to all but the real work of painting." 2 Unlike most art- ists, Bluemner created for himself his own personal system that was far more elaborate than any of his contemporaries could have imagined. This system gave him the force and the will to paint pic- tures of his human landscape which, although their real and possibly painful meaning was not then apparent, are ad- mired today for their visual beauty and their strength.
