<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of the American Academy of Religion LXII/3 The Want of Incest in the Human Family Or, Kin and Kind in Christian Thought Marc Shell THE KINSHIP STRUCTURE that defines the boundaries of a par- ticular people is not only one particular characteristic feature of its culture. The usual definition of culture, as "the aggregate of the language, tradition, art, kinship, religion, and so on, of a people" already presupposes the usual definition of a people as "a literal or figural family or tribe";' the kinship structure, with its interrelated earthly and divine elements, is thus an informing element of cul- ture in general, and the principal component of a particular peo- ple's culture is how it distinguishes one people, especially its own, from another people or from all other peoples. But what if a culture takes the universalist position, characteris- tic of not a few peoples, that there is only one human family, or that all humankind are akin? The rhetoric of the universalist position-"All human beings are siblings"-is beguiling. Against the particularist view that some human beings are fellow family members or tribespersons and other human beings are not fellow family members or tribesper- sons, the universalist asserts the apparently philanthropic and comforting view that all human beings are fellow family members (or no human beings are not fellow family members). What could be better? Yet the trade-off for this universalist sentiment is, we shall see, a characteristic psychological disquietude and political instability.

They are so in a way that encourages both the view that "Only my siblings are human, all others are non-human", which I considered in my Children of the Earth, and also the (perva- sive yet often indiscernible) persuasion that any act of sexual inter- course between one human being and another human being-as opposed to any act of sexual intercourse between a human being and an animal, a god, or God-is incestuous. This persuasion, we shall see, merges "figural" with "literal" meanings of such overburdened terms as sibling and incest. Among human beings, of course, incest is generally taboo, a term meaning both "dangerous" or "forbidden" as well as "sacred" or "consecrated."3 Human beings, we are told, both want to com- mit incest, since they are "natural" beings, and do not want to com- mit incest, since they are "political" beings. In this ideology of polar opposition between nature and politics, what we call "cul- ture" amounts to the psychologically agonizing and politically inev- itable process of ensuring that persons will avoid incest by such means as traditions that confer aesthetic significance on exoga- mous marriage and habits that confer religious meaning on celi- bacy. (Or so say psychoanalysis and structural anthropology, both acculturated during the secular wake of nineteenth century reli- gious proselytizing.)4 In the present essay, we will consider how the kinship structure at the determinate center of Christianity and some of its "secular" manifestations is rent throughout by the doctrine of universal sib- linghood and the taboo on incest. The same (Christian) culture that inhibits the practice of incest also represents it as an ineradica- ble ideal. In the first section of this essay, entitled "The Holy Fam- ily," we will consider the basic dogma of God the father's literal incarnation of himself as his own son and the consequent belief in Mary's fourfold relation to God as wife, sister, mother, and daugh- ter. In "Nuns and Friars" we will deliberate how the ideal of uni- versal siblinghood motivates religious and lay orders for which 2Matt. 23:8.

In "The Corinthians" we will elucidate secular and religious communities for which the idea of universal sib- linghood requires the practice of incest. "Carnal Contagion" will account for creeds according to which a person becomes akin to the family of anyone with whom he or she has sexual intercourse. And in "Letter and Spirit" we will heed characteristically Christian distinctions of religious from secular realm and literal from spiri- tual meaning, approaching thus the rhetoric of opposition and identity between physiological and sociological kinship. The incestuous aspect of Christian doctrine and practice is largely unremembered in a contemporary Christendom that often sees itself as secular and generally emphasizes more the political ideal of universal siblinghood ("All human beings are siblings, none are 'others' ") than the political hazard of this universalism's collapse of family with species ("Only my siblings are human beings, all 'others' are animals"). In "The Want of Incest in the Human Family," however, we will consider how certain Christian habits of thought obscure and express a typical want of incest-that is, both a lack of incest and a desire for it. THE HOLY FAMILY Christianity's famous attractiveness to non-Christian peoples- its successfully proselytizing trump card-comes partly from the ease with which its creeds seem to complete (or, teleologically speaking, end) non-Christian particularist creeds that define who is a brother (a member of one's family or nation) and who is an other. For example, Christianity, in deriving its Holy Family (God the father, Mary the mother, and God the son) from the first Jewish family (Abraham, Sarah, and Isaac), presents itself as Judaism's tel- eological completion. And to Judaism's acknowledgement of the merely twofold relationship of Sarah to Abraham (as Abraham's sister, so called by Abraham, as well as his wife)5 Christianity responds christologically with its insistence that Mary is fully 5See Rashi's commentary on the question whether Abraham lied when Abraham said, more than once, that Sarah was his sister. The motif of the sister-wife in the Old Testament, notably in the vaguely incestuous nominative relationship between Abraham and Sarah and between Isaac and Rebecca, occurs at Gen 20:2, 5, 12, 13 and Gen 26:6. The rikkub princi- ple in the logical system of a group of Karaites, the ba'ale ha-rikkub, includes the rule of "nominalism," whereby a stepsister, for example, has the status of a sister if she is called a</page><page sequence="4">628 Journal of the American Academy of Religion affined to God as God's fourfold kin: Mary is his sibling, spouse, parent, and child. (Likewise Mary's fourfold incest more than matches the uncle-niece incest at issue in the Danae story that Roman Christians so much admired.)6 In the Holy Family, either all are kin or none is kin. The usual theological definition of Mary as sponsa christi (spouse of Christ) brings out the fulfilling fourfold incest already implicit in non-Jewish, anthropomorphic incarnations of God. The Church fathers themselves thus remark that the Gospels offer a genealogy of Jesus that includes the incestuous sons of Tamar. They emphasize likewise that the first outsiders to greet the new- born Jesus were magi-priests born of incestuous unions among a nation, the Persians, whom many people supposed to practice incest without guilt.7 And, in this same tradition, the fathers felt comfortable in averring that Mary is the human female parent of God as son (she parented Christ), the spouse of God, the sibling of God (Jesus and she are children of the same Father), and the child of God.8 sister by the Bible. (See Louis M. Epstein:266-67.) For a further consideration of the wife- sister motif in the Bible, see Sanh. 58a-b. Abraham's apparent "lie" is worth considering in a historical perspective that sees the figure of Abram as having been influenced by the Hurrian culture of the Middle East. In the pre-Abramic Hurrian fratriarchy "authority was exercised by the eldest brother and is handed on from brother to brother as something inherited, the inheritance passing to the oldest son of the first brother on the death of the last brother" (de Vaux: 197; cf. Koschaker and Gordan). The fratriarch officially adopted spouses into the family as "sisters," either at the time of marriage or earlier. (See Seters:72-5, and Speiser:15-18.) 6See "The Golden Annunciation" in Shell (1994). 70n the incestuous relationship between Jesus and Mary, see Heuscher (207).

Rahab, a harlot, and Bathsheba, an adulteress, are included among the human ancestors of Jesus, whose mother was an extra-legal kind of harlot (i.e., neither legitimate nor illegiti- mate), since His conception was beyond the ordinary distinction between being in wedlock and being out of wedlock. On the genealogy of Jesus: Santiago (50) and Layard (301-2). For the magus: Rankin (119) and Moulton (204, 249-50). For the Persians: Antisthenes of Athens, as cited in Ranken (120), and Sidler. See Nietzsche's remark that "an ancient belief, especially strong in Persia, holds that a wise magi must be incestuously begotten" (vol. 1, sect. 9:56-57; trans. 60-61). 8Sponsa christi is a technical term used as early as Tertullian. See Jerome's theory of the virgin as the bride of Christ and of "spiritual matrimony" (Jerome, Letter 107, in CSEL 55:298; cf. Dumm:74). For a modern version of the theory, see Pius XII. For an anthropo- logical view of the institution of women marrying gods in Christianity and in other cultures, see Westermarck (1:403-6) and Harding. On the debate between those who held that Jesus was consubstantial with Mary and those who said that he was not, see Shell (1993b:27).</page><page sequence="5">Shell: Want of Incest 629 One partial elaboration of this perfectly incestuous quality of the Holy Family would involve the doctrine of the dormition, or koimesis, which "figures" visually, and thus "literalizes" icono- graphically, God's relationship to Mary of parenthood-if not also his relationship to her of spousehood, childhood and siblinghood. Dormition thus refers to the unique death and corporeal transla- tion to heaven of the Virgin Mary: upon dying, Mary's body is reju- venated, changing gradually from that of the mature mother of God (when Jesus was her infant son) to that of the infant daughter of God (when He becomes her Father).9 In her "second infancy" Mary is depicted like a baby in her grown son's arms, just as if she, the vergine madre, were now literally, in Dante's well known phrase, figlia del tuo figlio.1o There are, of course, vivid literary expressions of Mary's inces- tuously complete affinity to God as His child, spouse, and parent. One example would be Queen Marguerite of Navarre's Mirror of the Sinful Soul (1533), which John Calvin condemned as "spiritually libertine""' and which interested the young Princess Elizabeth Tudor-or her Protestant tutors-enough to translate it into English (1544). In Marguerite's Mirror the woman narrator seeks to replace the natural desire for and fear of incest in her own self-by means of a fulfilled spiritual incest with Christ Jesus. Princess Elizabeth-daughter both of Henry VIII, who was the first head of the Protestant Anglican Church, and of Anne Boleyn, who was actually executed for sibling incest-translates thus the words spoken to God by the sinful narrator: I am sister unto thee, but so naughty a sister, that better it is for me to hide such a name. 9The dormition is discussed specifically in the body of church literature called the Tran- situs Mariae and celebrated in Jerusalem's Abbey of the Dormition. See Lampe, s.v. koimesis, and Warner (88-9). 10See Kristeva (105). Kristeva says that "not only is Mary her son's mother and his daugh- ter [as in dormition], she is also his wife. Thus she passes through all three women's stages in the most restricted of all possible kinship systems." Kristeva omits Mary's fourth role, her role as Jesus's sister, and so Kristeva misses the essential perfection of Christian kinship. 11Marguerite's apparent support of the antinomian and pantheistic "Spiritual Libertines" was attacked by John Calvin in his strident pamphlet Against the ... Libertines [Contre la Secte phantastique et furieuse des libertins qui se nomment spirituels] (1545); Calvin (Opera 7:145-248). For the antinomian beliefs of the Libertins, see Walker (293-94). Calvin's attack on the Libertins offended Marguerite, and he wrote an ambiguously apologetic letter to her on April 28, 1545 (Opera 12:65). On Marguerite and the Libertins, see too Schneider (81-84) and Dagens.</page><page sequence="6">630 Journal of the American Academy of Religion O my father: what paternity! O my brother: what fraternity! O my child: what delight! 0 my husband: what conjunction!12 Lest we miss the extraordinary quality of this incestuous love as both fourfold and spiritual, the narrator asks, "Is there any love that may be compared unto this, but it hath some evil condition?" What is it in the Mirror that turns profane incest-which human beings want or desire in nature but also want or lack in political society-into the sacred incest that expresses and justifies the definitive sublimation at the crux of Christianity? It is that her divine (adopting) Father God-as opposed to her earthly (suppos- edly consanguineous) father Joseph-"handles" the girl. Thus she cries out to God: Thou dost handle my soul (if so I dare say) as a mother, daughter, sister, and wife. For Thou hast broken the kindred of my old father, calling me daughter of adoption. The narrator in the Mirror recognizes that it is only through the grace of God that profane incest can be converted to sacred. Her "sinful soul" looks into herself, as into a mirror, and then, beholding and contemplating what she is, she perceives how, of herself, and of her own strength, she can nothing that is good, or prevails for her salvation, unless it be through the grace of God, whose mother, daughter, sister and wife, by the scriptures, she proves herself to be. By its presentation of a sacred Holy Family that practices a four- fold kinship, Christian culture thus incorporates and transcends (ordinary) physically incestuous relations. The culture raises up such relations-or converts them, as Stendhal suggests in The Cenci-onto an (extraordinary) spiritually incestuous plane.13 On this spiritual plane the incestuous backgrounds of such saints as Albanus, Julian, and Gregory make them all the more holy.'4 12For the poet-lover in this fourfold kinship role, see also such passages as: "O my father, brother, child, and spouse"; "O what a sweet rest it is, of the mother, and the son together"; and "Now then that we are brother and sister together, I care but little for all other men." Quotations are from the facsimile edition of the 1544 manuscript in Shell (1993a). 13The father in Stendahl's Cenci, Francesco Cenci, "taught [his daughter Beatrice] a fright- ful heresy, which I scarcely dare repeat ... that when a father has carnal knowledge of his own daughter, the children born of the union are of necessity saints, and that all the greatest saints whom the Church venerates were born in this manner" (Stendhal:181-2). 14For Saint Albanus, see Rank. For Saint Julian, see Bart and Cook. For the story of Greg- ory, see Hartmann von Aue. On the general motif of saintly incest, see Harney.</page><page sequence="7">Shell: Want of Incest 631 NUNS AND FRIARS The centrality to some earthly Christian kinship relations of the dogma of spiritual incest is suggested by the fact that the kin- ship structures of the Catholic religious orders-as well as several "lay" orders and diverse "heretic" sects and other more-or-less Christian groups-generally imitate or follow from that of the Holy Family. For men and women who are "perfected"15 as sisters and brothers (or adoptive siblings) in Christ, not only are all persons on earth their brothers and sisters-"All ye are brethren"16-but all sexual relations are ipso facto incestuous. All sexual relations are incestuous because all persons are siblings. Accordingly, brothers and sisters in the Franciscan orders institutionalize in their socie- ties' kinship structures not only an androgynous conflation of gen- der roles-where celibate friars take on, in relation to one other, the alternating roles of mother and son (which some people call "homosexual" and others "nonsexual" or "transcendentally sex- ual")-but also an incestuous conflation of kinship roles-where spouse, child, parent, and sibling become one.'7 That is one rea- 15"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your father which is in Heaven is perfect" (Matt 5:48). Some thinkers take Jesus to mean what he says and argue that perfection, which refers to "the austerity of monastic life, monastic discipline," was the only non-degenerative form of life. Thus Archbishop John Hamilton in his Catechism (1552) writes that "matrimonye was degenerat fra the first perfeccion" (OED, "Perfection," sv 4). 16Matt 23:8. Church Fathers who urge Christians to pay heed to Matt 23:8 in such a way as to call all men their "brothers" (in Christ) and to call no-one by the name "father" (on earth) include: Saint Ignatius of Antioch, "The Epistle to the Ephesians," 10.3 (PG 5:653 and Corpus Ignatium:15-38); Clement of Alexandria, 7.14.5 (in GCS 3:61); Justinian, Dia- logue with Tryphon, 96 (PG 6:704); and Tertullian, Apologeticus, 39.8-9. 171t is worth remarking that homosexual and heterosexual relations, ordinarily thought of as different, verge here on one and the same. Although the Catholic orders, for example, affirm a patriarchal God, significant factors mitigate gender hierarchy within the orders. As Christian theology conceives marriage, the marriage union of a man and woman into one body-the corporeal union-the new body is often androgynous or hermaphroditic. Thus marriage to Christ erases or rise above gender differences. The thinking of many orders thus tends towards gender neutrality, at least ideally. This tendency has sources in the New Testament ("There is neither male nor female," says Paul, "for ye are all one in Christ Jesus" [Gal 3:26-28]), as well as in apocryphal works. The "kiss of charity" or "holy kiss"-a kiss given without any restriction as to gender or kinship-suggests the effect in general practice of the doctrinal tendency towards gender neutrality. In some English devotional works, moreover, Jesus is female, or is both a male lover and a female parent taken together. And gender neutrality was a tenet of such physically or spiritually incestuous sects as the Shakers and Perfectionists. For some Franciscan Brothers and Sisters, finally, there was not only an incestuous conflation of kinship roles (in which spouse, child, parent, and sibling become one) but also an androgynous conflation of gender roles (in which Franciscan friars alternately took on the roles of mother and son in relation to each other) (Cousins:20). As the first conflation (of kin) involves "spiritual incest," so the second (of gender) involves</page><page sequence="8">632 Journal of the American Academy of Religion son why, in Roman Christianity, it is incestuous for a nun or friar- for a religious sister or brother-to have sexual intercourse with anyone. There is a vast legal literature citing as incest all sexual rela- tions involving siblings in the sense of friars and nuns.Is And there is also a wide ranging popular literature. Thus we read in the thirteenth century, "Incest, thet is, bituhe sibbe, fleschliche oder gasteliche"; and in the fifteenth century, "Inceste . . . is bitwene sibbe fleshli or gasteli."'19 The Treatise on the Ten Commandments includes the rule that "incestus is he that delith with nonne, with kosyn, or with amaydon, the wich is called defloracio." And in Lydgate's Fall of Princes it is written that "incestus is trespassing with kyn or with blood, Or froward medlyng with hir that is a nunne."20 By the same token it is considered incest for anyone to have sexual relations with a godparent: Chaucer writes that "For right so as he that engendreth a child is his fleshly fader, right so is his godfader his fader espirituel. For which a womman may in no lasse synne assemblen with hire godsib than with hire owene flesshly brother."21 It is not surprising that many of the great Catholic saints were consanguineous loving brother-sister or mother-son couples who become Brothers and sisters in Christ.22 The Catholic orders' imi- tation of the Holy Family's extraordinary transcendence of ordi- nary kinship relations was meant to conjoin and transcend the polar opposites of this incest or chastity. The same conjunction or transcendence was the focus of intense debate during the Reforma- tion. The Protestant Luther, for example, complained of the "inces- "spiritual androgyny" taken together. The realization of incest and androgyny was the heret- ical project of the Brethren of the Free Spirit. On this question generally, see Shell (1988:224, 246-47) and Lemercier (34). There are also, of course, more or less heretical depictions of the divine Son in a homo- sexual relationship with the Father; see, for example, Max Ernst's Pietd, or Revolution by Night (oil on canvas, 1923, Tate Gallery). 18See Council of Rome (A.D. 402), can. 1, 2 (in Hefele, 2:87); Pope Gelasius I (A.D. 494), letter to the bishops of Lucania, c. 20 (in Gratian, causa 27, q. 1, c. 14); Council of Macon (A.D. 585), can. 12 (in Hefele: 3:37); Gratian, causa 30, q. 1, c. 5.10; and Oesterl&amp;. 19For the thirteenth century quotation, Ancrene Riwle 106/21; in Kurath et al., s.v.

The conservative Thomas More, on the other hand, argued that the marriage of (Brother) Martin Luther, an Augustinian eremite, to (Sister) Catherine von Bora was incestuous. Claiming that clerical marriage "defileth the priest more than double or trebel whore- dom," Thomas More wrote of "the frer and the nunne" of Germany: Let not therefore Tyndall (good reder) wyth his gay gloryouse wordes carye you so fast &amp; so far away, but that ye remembre to pull hym bakke by the sleue a lytle, and aske hym whyther his owne hyghe spirytuall doctour mayster Martyne Luther hym selfe, beynge specyally borne agayne &amp; new created of the spyryte, whom god in many places of holy scrypture hath commaunded to kepe his vowe made of chastyte when he then so far contrarye there vnto toke out of relygyon a spouse of Cryste, wedded her hym selfe in reproche of wedloke, called her his wyfe, and made her his harlot, and in doble despyte of maryage and relygyon both, lyueth wyth her openly and lyeth wyth her nyghtly, in shameful inceste and abominable lycherye.23 Luther's brother-sister or friar-nun marriage was a decisive moment in the history of Christian sexuality. It had its imitators across Europe and Great Britain. (Among these would be the mar- riages to religious sisters by John Bale, Bernardino Ochino, Leo Judae [a disciple of Zwingli who married a Beguine in 1523], and Francois Lambert [a Franciscan monk who proposed in 1528 that his monastery might become a school of marriage].24 The discussion of marriage and other sexual relations generally in terms of "a kind of incest"-as Shakespeare puts it in Measure for Measure(3.1.p38)-became part of Renaissance revaluation of sex- ual liaisons.25 (In Shakespeare's play, the novice Isabella-whose name means something like "consecrated to God"-is both the con- sanguineous "sister" to Lucio and the "beloved" of Vincentio. Vincentio, in the guise of a Brother, loves Isabella physically and spiritually as his near-Sister.

Liberty, or libertinism, amounts to universal incest enacted without guilt. This position expresses not so much the explicit views of ortho- dox (that is, non-"heretical") Protestantism and Catholicism as the want. The normative Luther, after all, noting that his unfulfilled desire (want) made him prey for the devil, argued that most all men were imperfect; and so, since men could not be sinlessly celi- bate,28 Luther denounced various forms of spiritual kinship, including those that informed the Catholic orders and Catholic gossipred. "Love needs no laws," said Luther about the diriment impediments to chaste, or non-incestuous, marriages presented by the traditional Christian gossipreds (godchildren and godparents), for example. Thus Luther swept away "those stupid barriers due to spiritual fatherhood, motherhood, brotherhood, sisterhood, and childhood"-or so it seems.29 Still, Martin Luther was confronted with the incestuous conse- quences of the universalist doctrine that "All ye are brethren"-a doctrine that was sometimes taken literally to apply to all people, not merely to religious siblings and godchildren. And so he was pushed towards the assertion that, since no one is really perfectly 26See "'In the presence of my enemies'" (in Shell 1993b:176-80). 271t is worth remarking that, by the same argumentation, one might say that, If all human beings want to kill their siblings, and if we are all siblings, then all human beings want to kill everybody. 28For Luther's critique of religious celibacy, see "An Exhortation to the Knights of the Teu- tonic Order That They Lay Aside False Chastity and Assume the True Chastity of Wedlock" (Works 45:141-58) and "Exhortation to All Clergy Assembled at Augsburg" (Works 34:40- 52). 29Brain:94. Cf. Luther, "The Persons Related by Consanguinity and Affinity Who are For- bidden to Marry According to the Scriptures, Leviticus 18" (Works 45:8) and "The Estate of Marriage" (Works 45:24). Luther did not really sweep away all barriers to marriage; he stressed the distinction between figure and letter, or spirit and body, and thus redefined the incest taboo in terms of a literal, or corporeal, principle.</page><page sequence="11">Shell: Want of Incest 635 chaste, everyone is, in the terminology of "perfection," non-chaste- literally incestuous. This position, with its shades both of Mary's fourfold incestuous extra-legal union with God and also of Sister Catherine's twofold incestuous marriage union with Brother Mar- tin, suggests the limited extent to which Luther retreated from the ideal kinship of Christian perfection. As early as the first century A.D., one idea inhabiting both the sacred "center" and the profane "periphery" of Christian doctrine has been that the ability to commit incest without incurring guilt is a definitive sign of divine grace. So far as I know, the first refer- ence to this notion appears in the New Testament itself. Here the acts of incest committed by the Corinthian sect were not "deed[s] done secretly out of weakness but . . . ideological act[s] done openly with the approval of at least an influential sector of the com- munity" (Collins:253). That Paul felt and feared the Christian attractiveness of the Corinthian's incestuous creed (as a counter- culture from within, say) may help to explain why Paul, calling the Corinthians' rituals "such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife" (1 Cor 5:1), actually required that such Corinthian heretics all be killed. Yet, the Corinthian sect had probably only "taken to heart" Paul's own statement about freedom from the law ("All things are lawful for me") to indicate freedom from such "Old" Testament rules as those concerning incest ("The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover").30 In the medieval and early modern periods, the Corinthians' type of endorsement of guiltless incest informed the creeds of the lay order called the Brethren of the Free Spirit. (These Brethren, some say, had tens of thousands of adherents between the thir- teenth and seventeenth centuries.)31 For the Brethren, the spiritu- ally incestuous relations of the Virgin Mary to God were to be reproduced on earth in an edenic or paradisiacal state of grace. 301 Cor 10:23; and Lev 18:8. For this view of the Corinthians, see also Allo (121) and Conzelmann (97). 31For a general account of the Brethren, see Cohn and Guarnieri. In Italy St. Bernadine of Siena was influenced by the Brethren (Bernard of Siena 1:34, 536; 3:109; 4:544; 6:248). In Germany the Brethren influenced Meister Eckhardt (Tauler) and the polygamist Anabaptists of Munster (Telle 1952:169; and Encyclopedia Britannica., s.v. "Eckhardt"). The Belgian David Joris, a prominent member of a local sect influenced by the Free Spirit, had an effect on Bosch, whose painting "The Garden of Earthly Delights" is sometimes said to depict the Free Spirit's "incestuous orgies" (Fraenger:42).</page><page sequence="12">636 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Their motto was the Pauline rule, ubi spiritus, ubi libertas:32 When the spirit of the Lord is in one, then the law is erased and one is raised above the law. It is important to consider that between the libertinism of the Brethren and the celibacy of the normative religious orders there is a difference only of polar opposition or inversion: A celibate in the normative orders gracefully overcomes sexual desire and loves eve- ryone (the same) as universal siblings; a libertine in the Brethren of the Free Spirit gracefully overcomes sexual desire or conscience and loves everyone (as the same). For both groups, sexual inter- course with a sibling is no worse or better than sexual intercourse with any other person. The religious celibate seeks liberty from physical desire; the libertine seeks liberty from rules that restrict physical intercourse. But for both, in the words of Saint Paul, "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty" (2 Cor 3:17).33 In nineteenth-century America, with its sometimes remarkable fusion of a republican ideology of common property with a Chris- tian ideology of universal brotherhood, the idea of liberty did not lose its incestuous aspect. (A Calvinist tradition adjusted to the New World did, however, foster the institution of the American nuclear family.) For example, John Noyes in Oneida relied on Jesus's saying that "All ye are brethren" when he expounded his Perfectionist Society's system of pantogamy, or universal marriage. Noyes argued that free sex without shame, which is wanting (or lacking) in the ordinary system of marriage, is not only wanted (or desired) by, but actually required within, a holy community where "all things are lawful for me" (as Saint Paul puts it). Noyes also stressed the corresponding view that free sex, including incest, is a sign of the "liberty" that grace confers.34 (Compare the French 32This was the motto of the Libertine Brethren (Telle 1937:297). 33Cf. note 13 above. On the general problem of this "liberty" in relation to "libertinism," see Shell: 1993b 81-84. 34For Paul, see 1 Cor 6:12. For Noyes, see his letter ofJanuary 15, 1837, to David Harrison (quoted in Dixon 2:55-6). Noyes bases his argument for universal physical love, hence incest, on the same premise of universal siblinghood that the monastic orders used when they argue against any physical love as incest. "Love between the children of God," writes Noyes, "is exalted and developed by a motive similar to that which produces ordinary family affection" (Anon.:27). Noyes continues: "The sons and daughters of God, must have even a stronger sense of blood-relationship than ordinary brothers and sisters. They live as chil- dren with their Father forever, and the paramount affection of the household is ... brotherly love. ... A brother may love ten sisters, or a sister ten brothers, according to the customs of the world. The exclusiveness of marriage does not enter the family circle.

At the Oneida Commu- nity [this] is regarded... as perfectly lawful and right."36 Just as in a Christian celibate order all sexual intercourse is prohibited, so in a Christian libertine order all sexual intercourse is prescribed as chaste. It would be a mistake to dismiss Noyes as an irreverent, irrele- vant wacko. The success of the Oneida community and the long- standing tradition of which Noyes was only one part attest otherwise. Heresies, after all, develop from within a religion; often they draw out its ineradicable if discomforting aspects. "Only great minds can bring forth heresies," said Saint Augustine. LETTER AND SPIRIT The Christian celibate and libertine responses to the supposed confrontation between the "natural" requirement to reproduce no matter how and the "political" requirement to limit the ways of reproduction seem extreme to some modern or secularized sensi- bilities. Not surprisingly, then, nineteenth and twentieth century thinkers cultivated a certain forgetfulness (even denial) of ontoge- netic or phylogenetic Christian origins. Instead, they emphasized the properly mysterious (sometimes incarnative) distinction family circle; and ... brotherly love ... takes the place of supremacy which the matrimonial affection occupies in this world." 35Sade argues for incest in his "Francais, encore un effort si vous voulez ftre republicains" (221-22). Already in the fifth century B.C., Plato in his Republic had gone so far as to argue that the people of the ideal republic should think that they are member siblings of one family. (That is the "noble lie" of national kinship that Plato compares with the fiction of common autochthony in Oedipus's Thebes; Plato, Rep. 414c-415d.) And if all people in the polis are essentially siblings, then every act of sexual intercourse with a fellow member of the polis must be incestuous: "With everyone he happens to meet, he will hold that he's meeting a brother, or a sister, or a father, or a mother, or a son, or a daughter, or their descendants or ancestors" (463). Cornford, in a note to his edition of the Republic (161-63), argues that "Plato did not regard the ... connections of brothers and sisters as incestuous." 36Ellis: 187-8. Noyes counters the usual objection to "amative intercourse between near relations"-that " 'breeding in and in' deteriorates offspring"-with his own genetic theories. Cf. Noyes' monograph on eugenics, "An Essay on Scientific Propagation."

This cultural amnesia and its tell-tale distinguishings between literal and figural levels might exemplify how the fear of profane incest and/or the desire for sacred incest goads human beings to produce cultured religions. Protestants and Catholics, wont to argue both for the anthropo- morphic incarnation of God and for universal human siblinghood, want to distinguish between letter and spirit; or they need to make this distinction for the sake of preserving the social order-or the social order as we know it (which requires sexual reproduction of the "natural" human kind that does not destroy generational hier- archies, say). But in the culturally vibrant terminology of kinship it is debatable which kind of kinship is the literal one. After all, the fundamental distinction between "real" kinship and "pseudo"-kin- ship-between literal and figural signification-is the topic of a still- unresolved debate about whether kinship is essentially a matter of biology (however understood) or of sociology. Which is funda- mental in determining "literal" kinship, for example, my likeness to my supposed genitor or my likeness to God, who created me in his image? Which substance is fundamental: the genes I share with my genitor, the love between my adoptive parent and myself, the milk I sucked from my mother, the blood I commingled with my blood brother, the wafer and wine I shared at a communal feast, or the dust from which all things (including myself) are made? Moreover, the literalist view of kinship is itself fictive insofar as we cannot know who are our consanguineous kin. Any particular consanguineous link is always deniable if not always denied. Who can deny that it is possible that her children or parents are not her children or parents? Bastardy, the stuff of fears and hopes, is always possible. Who can know for sure that any given child is a changeling or not? Mothers and fathers can always find grounds to doubt or deny their children, and children can always find grounds to deny their mothers and fathers. By the same token, it is always deniable, if not always denied, that one's lover is not one's consan- guineous kinsperson. The logical reality, that my lover may be my consanguineous kinsperson, merges on the oneirological (dream-like) fiction-the Freudian nightmare or the Christian fulfillment-that my lover is</page><page sequence="15">Shell: Want of Incest 639 my consanguineous kinsperson. The particular family dissolves in the Platonic republic of dreams.37 This disappearance of the literal family is the subject of jokes, but it is itself no joke. For belief in the distinction between literal and figural kinship and also belief in the possibility of ever know- ing enough to tell for sure Who's Who in a literal kinship system are necessary to society if, as psychoanalysts and structural anthro- pologists aver (along with others), obeisance to the taboo on incest is a precondition for the continuation of society-or of society as we know it. It makes as much (or as little) sense in this view-a view of both the inevitable erosion of the distinction between figure and letter and also the impossibility of knowing Who's Who in a "literal" kinship structure-for me to call "sibling" the person my sociologi- cal parent thinks of as his or her "child" as for me to call anyone else "sibling." ("Think of us as of a father"-King Claudius's com- mand to Young Hamlet that he think of Claudius as his father- would actually make Claudius to all intents and purposes Hamlet's biological genitor no less than Old Hamlet is Young Hamlet's father).38 Finally, it is no more (or less) fictive to say that "Only my consanguineous parent's sons are my siblings" than to say with the universalist Christian that "All human beings are siblings."39 CARNAL CONTAGION The Christian collapse of particular ("literal") kinship relations into one ("figural") universalist relation is matched in Christian dogma by the practically influential doctrine of carnal contagion (contagio carnalis). This doctrine, as it presents a distinct soci- opathology of human affinities, delineates an uncontrolled spread 37In his Republic Plato discusses how in dreams everyone sleeps with mother or queen. For him such tyrants as Oedipus and Gyges do what everyone dreams of. See Shell (1978: 21-30, 96-100). 381.2 107-8. For the view that in Hamlet there is no-one either kin or non-kin but thinking makes him so (cf. Hamlet 2.2.256), see Shell (1993b 96-123). 39Matt 23:8. Cf. Gal 3:26-28: "For in ChristJesus you are all sons [or children] of God ... There is neither Jew nor Greek ... for ye are all one in Christ Jesus." Church Fathers who urge Christians to obey the implications of Matt 23:8 in such a way as to call all men their "brothers" and to call no-one by the name "father" include: Ignatius of Antioch, "To the Ephesians," 10.3, PG 5:653; Clement of Alexandria, Stromata, 7.14.5, GCS 3:61; Justinian, Dialogue with Tryphon, 96, PG 6:704; and Tertullian, Apologeticus, 39.8-9.</page><page sequence="16">640 Journal of the American Academy of Religion of particular kinship relations to the point where every human being is close kin or might as well be. According to the "great mystery" of Pauline Christianity, a man "shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh."40 The traditional Church, understanding marital sexual intercourse as the essential (teleological) aspect of extramarital relations, extended this Pauline idea of marital conjunction so as to include the union of fornicator and fornicatrix. "Know ye not," asked Paul, "that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh?"41 Thus all sexual intercourse, whether marital or extramarital, spreads kinship by bringing the relatives of each party into the kindred of the other.42 Rabanus Maurus argued that "if one sleeps with a woman who sleeps with another man who sleeps with another woman who sleeps with me, then ... my flesh is inextricably bound up with the flesh of that first man's."43 Thanks to the doctrine of carnal contagion thus understood, promiscuity, especially when unrecorded, fulfills itself as unwit- ting incest in subsequent generations. It is this essentially univer- sal incest that Christian culture, with its myth of extra-legal fourfold incest, both fears and desires. For Jonas of Orleans, "all illicit carnal relations are incestuous."44 The doctrine of carnal contagion informed not only Catholi- cism but also the political foundations of Protestantism. When the Anglican church was constituted in the 1530s and 1540s, for example, the doctrine of carnal contagion was used to claim that King Henry VIII's marriages to his sister-in-law (Catherine of Ara- gon) and to his mistress's sister (Anne Boleyn) were incestuous. If King Henry's brother, Arthur, had had sexual intercourse with a woman, Catherine of Aragon, then she was the king's kin and his marriage to her was null and void; by the same token, if Henry had slept with a woman, Mary Boleyn, then that woman's sister, Anne, was the queen's sister and there stood between Henry and Anne a diriment impediment to marriage. 40Eph 5:31-32. 411 Cor 6:16. Cf. Gen 2:24. 42On the kinship relationship engendered by sexual intercourse, see Gratian, Decretum (35, q. 5, 10); Orlando Bandinelli (203); Stephen of Tournai (250); Bernardus Balbus (168); and Feije (ch. 14). 43Fowler:12-13. For the Latin term, see Rabanus [Hrabanus] Maurus (14: 900-912). 44Jonas of Orleans, De Institutione Laicailli (PL 106: 183-84).</page><page sequence="17">Shell: Want of Incest 641 The way that the doctrine of carnal contagion allows kinship to spread haphazardly so as eventually to include everyone in the world has its counterpart in the apparent randomness, much joked about in most all cultures, of rules determining whether one can marry a cousin, say, and, if so, to what degree of cousinship. After all, the question whether to draw a border-line between chaste and incestuous sexual relations has two answers: No, in which case one must choose whether to call all sexual intercourse chaste or incestuous; and Yes, in which case one must decide where to draw the line. Where should one draw the line? Jacob's Well (the fourteenth century treatise), which follows the doctrine of carnal contagion in collapsing the distinction between the kinds of kinship conferred by marital and extra-marital unions, makes it the fifth degree.45 Some Christian doctrines claim that cousinship to the seventh degree makes a sexual liaison incestuous,46 in which case most sexual liaisons in small towns would be literally incestuous. But even in the entire world, the hypothesis of human monogenesis- the belief that all men and women are descended in common from a single couple (Adam and Eve, say)-might mean that any and all sexual liaisons would be potentially incestuous and hence, teleo- logically speaking, also actually incestuous. That kinship back to any known or knowable degree-even so far back as the first human beings-makes sexual relationships incestuous was thus a frequent view of the church. In 868 A.D., for example, church officers ruled that "we will not define the number of generations within which the faithful may be joined. No Christian may accept a wife ... if any blood relationship is recorded, known, or held in memory."47 (A word is in order here about how concern with diri- ment or kinship-based impediments to marriage makes for contra- dictory methods of counting numerical degrees48 and for deniable marriage records. More importantly, that concern with impedi- ments also makes for potentially sociopathological dependencies 45"Whan a man hath medlyd wyth a womman, or a womman wyth a man, neyther may be wedded to otheres kyn, into the fyfte degre, ne medle wyth hem; for if thei don, it is incest" (Brandeis, Jaocb's Well, 162/15). 46Julius I specified the seventh remove as the limit of diriment impediment to marriage (Decreta Julii papae decem). 47Worms, can. 32 (in Mansi 15:875). 48Thus Stephan of Tournai notes that "the counting begins with the brothers according to some and with the sons of the brothers according to others" (Summa, 255). Cf. Smith (ch. 2).</page><page sequence="18">642 Journal of the American Academy of Religion on deniable baptismal and marital certification as the means to avoid unwitting brother-sister marriages.49) Every Adam's son, a brother to every other-this, the conflation of species with family, is the pathway from tribal brotherhood to universal otherhood in celibacy or incest. The secular culture of Christendom, both religious and secular, generally resists investigation of its own kinship structure as a hypostatic be-all. And certainly the temptation is great to forget the want of incest logically and ideologically implicit in the interre- lated doctrines of universal siblinghood and the Holy Family-that is, both the lack of incest and the desire for it. Yet we would be passing over in silence a definitive aspect of Judeo-Christian habits of thought if, dreading a routine charge of outlandishness or scurrilousness we were to forgo exoteric investi- gation of politically motivated, incest-avoiding aspects and politi- cally informing family- or nation-defining facets of Christian universalist kinship. Likewise we would be negligent were we to refrain from further consideration of the political implications of how different reli- gious doctrines of kin and kind deal in more or less tolerant ways with the often discomforting existence of families and/or species not one's own.s0 Secular Christendom's powerful want of incest, together with its frequent failure to acknowledge openly its mun- dane retreat from the ideal of universal siblinghood or united nationhood, is too influential to overlook. The want of incest moti- vates an all-too-easy slide from the idealist doctrine that "All human beings are siblings" to the political dogma that "Only my siblings are human beings, all 'others' are animals"-with what end for the life of humankind God only knows. 490n the general literary topos of such marriages, see Shell (1988: 10-15). 500n how variously particularist or universalist kinship creeds (including those of the "Peoples of the Book"-Christianity, Judaism, and Islam) tend towards variously tolerant or intolerant practices towards other peoples, see Shell (1982: 52-53; 1991: 306-316).</page><page sequence="19">Shell: Want of Incest 643 REFERENCES Allo, E.B.
