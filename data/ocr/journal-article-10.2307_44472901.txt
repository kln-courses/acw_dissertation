Schneider Joseph Awad Univ. of California at San Diego Univ. of California at San Diego Rolf H. Eppinger David Dainty U.S. DOT/NHTSA Univ. of California at San Diego Alan M. Nahum Steve Forrest Univ. of California at San Diego MCR Technology ABSTRACT Nineteen sled impact tests were conducted simulating a frontal collision exposure for an unrestrained driver. The deceleration sled buck configuration utilized the passenger compartment of a late model compact passenger vehicle, a rigid driver's seat, and a custom fabricated energy- absorbing steering column and wheel assembly. Sled impact velocities ranged from 24.1 to 42.6 km/hr. The purpose of the study was to investigate the kinematic and kinetic interaction of the driver and the energy -absorbing steering assembly and their relationship to the thoracic/abdominal injuries produced. The similarities and differences between human cadaver and anthropomorphic dummy subjects were quantified. A Hybrid III test subject subject developed (1) similar axial steering column forces to those produced by the cadaver subjects, (2) lower initial peak spinal acceleration than the cadaver subjects, and (3) larger steering wheel rim moments about the pitch axis than when the cadavers upper abdomen contacted the lower wheel rim. Calculations of the effective mass of the test subjects interacting with the column assembly also demonstrated similarity. The averages of the steering rim deformations suggest more rim deformation at the top and less deformation at the bottom for the cadaver relative to the Hybrid III. Maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale injuries sustained in the cadaver exposures ranged from 2 to 5. At the 42.6 km/hr test condition three out of seven cadavers sustained liver injuries. Energy calculations lead to the conclusion the cadaver thorax absorbed a greater proportion of the initial kinetic energy than did the Hybrid III thorax. INTRODUCTION Just over two decades ago, a component test with a body torso form was suggested as a means of introducing reasonable energy- absorbing elements into steering assemblies. [1] Once energy- absorbing steering assemblies became common, it was found [2] "current ene rgy- absorbing steering assemblies annually prevent 1300 fatalities and 23,000 nonfatal injuries requiring hospitalization." In spite of the propitious news about steering assemblies, Malliaris et al. found the steering assembly still accounted for 26.9 % of the total "harm" to restrained and unrestrained occupants. [3] A succession of papers [4,5,6,7] focused on "what to do next" by conducting sled tests with the torso form, the Part 572 dummy, the Hybrid III dummy, and porcine subjects. The present paper focuses on the unrestrained occupant/ steering assembly interaction by using cadavers and the Hybrid III dummy in sled tests . TEST METHODOLOGY The sled buck employed in the study was based on a Chevrolet Citation passenger compartment. Figure 1 illustrates the sled buck and the driver's position. The production steering column assembly was replaced with a generic energy -absorbing design based on the deformation of a steel tape in a roller assembly at the forward end of the column which provided a constant force versus column stroke characteristic shown in Figure 2 (the steel tape was moved about 2.54 cm through the rollers prior to the sled test to insure the mechanism was not stuck) . The standard Citation column and the roller assembly column are shown in Figure 3. The stroking mass, or that mass lying between the occupant chest and the energy absorbing element, of the two designs are within 30 grams of each other. (The total mass of the production column is about 3.49 kg more than the generic design, i. e., the energy-absorbing steering assembly on the sled is matched to the stroking mass of the Citation steering column and not the total mass.) The production steering wheel, Figure 4, was modified to allow incorporation of instrumentation which permitted measurement of axial loads applied to the * The number in brackets refers to references at the end of the paper. 3.1388 0096-736X/88/9603-1 388$02.50 Copyright 1988 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">Figure 1 - Driver's Qampartment Configuration 554(1 " ' 4450 &lt; • 5560 * • _ FORCE « ■ ^ "* (NEWTONS) 2670 « • Ī I .09 cm Thick x 8.26 cm Wide Band PRO •• / R90 ' ' I 2.S4 S. 08 7.62 10.16 Figure 2 - Deflection (cm) Typical Steering Column Foroe/Deflection Characteristics vinder Axial Loading STEERING WEEL 4 HJB PAD, 2.27 kg 00UJW. 3.32 k.

Located between the wheel and column is a five axis transducer which measures (1) orthogonal forces along the column axis and perpendicular to it in a vertical and horizontal direction, and (2) moments applied to the steering wheel about the pitch and yaw axes. The direction and sign convention for the steering transducers are contained in Figure 1. The production instrument panel was removed and occupant knee restraint was controlled by def ormable blocks of semi-rigid polyurethane foam. A rigid seat back and cushion were adjusted longitudinally and vertically to accommodate stature changes of the cadaver subjects. The windshield was replaced following each sled exposure. The sled deceleration pulse utilized was a square wave , e . g., 7.5 G's magnitude and .114 seconds duration for a 24.1 km/hr sled test. All tests simulated a 12 o'clock frontal collision direction. A review of crash test data for the Citation vehicle indicated low levels of horizontal and vertical wheel movement for the velocity range of interest and therefore column intrusion was not simulated. The instrumentation for the cadaver subjects included an array of 15 accelerometers placed around the thorax [8,9] as shown in Figure 5. A triaxial accelerome ter was attached to the spinal column at the 4th thoracic vertebra. The thoracic accelerometer array secured to the Hybrid III included a triaxial accelerometer at the thoracic center of gravity location depicted in Figure 6. [10] Chest deflection was measured directly on the Hybrid III dummy. Points on the dummy subject -- indicated by photographic targets placed around the body and on the buck - - were digitized. An algorithm was developed to determine the difference between the spinal marker and the sternal marker, or the chest deflection.

The film analysis technique was judged not accurate enough to be used for this paper. Future research will focus on determining an acceptable method of measuring chest deflection in the cadaver subj ects . A total of seven Hybrid III and twelve cadaver tests were conducted. The primary test variables are listed in Table 1. Pretest protocol was designed to produce test conditions as similar as practical between the cadaver and Hybrid III tests. The testing conditions were divided into three nominal sled velocities of 24, 34, and 40 km/hr. It should be noted that the early 24 km/hr cadaver subjects (test nos. CI85020, CI85021, and CI85022) were placed lower in the seat than their counterpart Hybrid III tests. A revised seating procedure was used for the later cadaver tests. All curves used in this paper were filtered according to SAE Recommended Practice J211) chest acceleration is Channel Class 180, steering column force is Class 600, steering moment is Class 600, and steering column deflection is Class 180. The particular digital filter is a two pass, zero phase shift, second order Butterworth filter. CADAVER/HYBRID III INTERACTION with STEERING ASSEMBLY An estimate of the "effective mass" of the occupant thorax which interacted with the steering wheel was obtained from an impulse - momentum calculation. The force versus time history of the steering column axial load was integrated and divided by the sled change- in -velocity to yield an effective mass value for the thorax. This was then normalized by the total mass of the subject. These data are listed in Table 2. The normalized effective mass for all subjects was found to be between 0.28 and 0.49 over the range of velocities studied. The location of the steering wheel rim with respect to the chest shown in Figures 7 and 8 is based on photographic analysis of the high speed motion picture films. The rim appeared initially to contact the Hybrid III just below the "sixth" rib and -- because the horizontal steel 6th rib is rigidly attached to all the other ribs -- interacts with a fairly rigid chest structure. In contrast, the rim contacts the cadavers in the vicinity of the 8th through 10th ribs -- the upper abdomen -- and appears initially to load a more localized and softer region than with the Hybrid III. Table 3 summarizes the dynamic steering column stroke for the Hybrid III and the cadavers. The dummy shows slightly greater -- say 1-inch -- column stroke. A word of caution about Table 3 . The maximum allowable column stroke was set at 15.9 cm. Hybrid III tests CI85017 and CI85018 stroked the column all the way, or bottomed it. After the test series had been completed, an experimental problem was discovered which resulted in cadaver tests CI85024 and CI86003 bottoming at about 10.8 cm and cadaver tests CI86001 and CI86002 bottoming 872202 SLED /rot Effective * INITIAL SuDject Mass TEST NO VELOCITY (/fdt/Delta V /Mass (kn/h) (N-sec) Subject) ļ ========= J ========= ; ======== i =========== ; !

Consequently, caution should be used in interpreting Table 3 for the higher test speeds. (The sources of the premature column bottoming have been identified; and a testing protocol developed to prevent its reoccurrence . ) Similarly to Reference 6, the Hybrid III in the 24 and 34km/hr tests recorded its maximum chest compression prior to a significant portion of the steering column stroke. For the 40km/hr tests however, the Hybrid III shows an initial chest compression before the column begins to stroke and -- see Figure 9 -- a rise to a maximum value after the column bottoms . To quantify the amount of steering wheel rim deformation experienced during a test, pre- and post- test measurements were made according to the scheme shown in Figure 10. This figure divides the steering wheel rim into four segments represented by 3, 6, 9, and 12 o'clock positions. The steering wheel was placed on a flat surface both before and after the test and height measurements were taken from the plane of the steering wheel mounting surface to the o'clock position on the wheel rim. The differences between the pre- and post-test numbers are contained in Table 4. The source of the scatter in Table 4 has not been identified. There is no clear difference between cadavers and Hybrid III in pattern of lower rim and upper rim deformations.

Table 4 - Summary of Steering Wheel Rim Deformation (Non-Scaled Cadaver Data) there is more deformation at the 12 o'clock position and less at the 6 o'clock position for the cadavers relative to the Hybrid III. This observance supports the above kinematic observation; namely the s tiff er Hybrid III more fully loads the lower rim causing a pattern of higher deformation at 6 o'clock, while the cadaver more heavily loads the top rim, leading to the higher 12 o'clock deformations. 3.1393</page><page sequence="7">RESPONSE SCALING The cadavers in Table 1 have different masses and dimensions relative to the Hybrid III. The responses of the cadavers should undergo modification following a set of compatible scaling laws prior to comparison with the Hybrid III. One set of model scaling laws has been used by some of the authors in the past. [11,12] To review briefly, A - the scaling constant, s « subscript for the scaled data which is suppose to mimic the Hybrid III, and i - subscript for i-th subject. If mass density (mass/volume) and modulus of elasticity are assumed constant, then the following relationships are true: Velocity Vg -= Mass Ms - A3 Mļ_ Acceleration Ag - A~1/3 A^ Length Lg - A1/3 Time Tg - A1/3 Ti Force Fg = A2/3 Moment Mg - A M^ For example, for test no. CI85020, the value of A would be (165/120) ' . This scaling algorithm does not alter the velocity, but it does modify most other parameters of interest, e. g. , acceleration, time, force, etc. The cadaver responses of Figures 11 through 18 have been scaled according to the above scheme where the standard weight of the scaled model (the Hybrid III) is assumed to be 165 lbs. Figures 11 through 18 are discussed in the next section. HYBRID III BIOFIDELITY The biofidelity of an anthropomorphic test device can be defined as the extent to which the anthropomorphic test device mimics the dynamic response of a living human under a particular test condition. Frequently in impact testing, the assumption is made that a human cadaver will respond similarly to a living human. If true, then the extent to which an anthropomorphic test device's response replicates the response of cadavers is a measure of the dummy's biofidelity. In this study, the Hybrid Ill's biofidelity will be assessed by examining the extent to which it fits within the corridor of several response parameters . For the three test velocities there exist both a Hybrid III dummy and one or more cadaver exposures. Using the scaling approach described above and then calculating cadaver plus and minus one standard deviation (or one sigma) curves, [13] the Hybrid III can be overlaid on the cadaver corridor for each test velocity (not possible in the case of the 34 km/hr test condition in which there was only one cadaver exposure). For example, the crosshatching in Figure 11 is the cadaver corridor for that test condition and is bounded by the plus and minus one standard deviation curves. Figure 11 shows the force transmitted along the column (measured at the location labeled "rim transducer" in Figure 3) versus time for the 24km/hr test. The single line is the average of the Hybrid III while the crosshatched area is the cadaver corridor. The Hybrid III is within the corridor and reasonable given the fact the early 24km/hr sled tests were conducted with the cadaver seated a little low. The Hybrid III is compared against the one cadaver tested at 34km/hr in Figure 12. The two are very similar. The cadaver trace does show a second peak which corresponds to the column prematurely bottoming due to an experimental problem. (The column bottoming previously discussed in the section CADAVER /HYBRI D III INTERACTION with STEERING ASSEMBLY. ) The 40km/hr results are in Figure 13 . The Hybrid III is within the cadaver corridor. Although averaging techniques have been used, the second peak - - which occurs when the column bottoms -- can be clearly seen. The next comparison concerns spinal acceleration (see Figure 6) . The cadavers had a triaxial accelerometer located at the fourth thoracic vertebra (T4) . The Hybrid Ill's accelerometer was mounted at the standard center -of- gravity position. A plane parallel to the floor of the sled buck and passing through the T4 accelerometers of the cadaver would be slightly higher than a similar plane through the center- of- gravity accelerometer ' s of the Hybrid III, i. e., the cadaver's accelerometers are above the Hybrid Ill's. In retrospect, it might have been better to position the cadaver accelerometer cluster at the seventh thoracic vertebra. However, given the variability in (1) cadaver size and weight, (2) cadaver kinematics due to differences in size, and (3) positioning a flaccid cadaver to sit like a rigid dummy, the small difference of 5 to 7 cm in locating the accelerometer cluster along T4 to T7 is probably not important. The resultant chest acceleration of the Hybrid III is compared with the cadaver corridor (chest resultant acceleration) for 24, 34, and 40km/hr in Figures 14, 15, and 16. Relative to cadavers, the Hybrid III produces lower peak spinal acceleration. As shown in Figures 7 and 8 and as previously discussed, the steering wheel rim initially loads all the Hybrid Ill's thorax while the rim initially reacts with the cadavers locally in the region of the 8th through 10th rib. In Figures 14 through 16, the Hybrid III exhibits an initially lower chest acceleration corresponding to a higher effective mass being coupled to the lower rim. Subsequently, the Hybrid III falls within the top of the cadaver corridor (in Figure 14 through 16, this phenomenon roughly begins after the curves pass the 16 G value on the vertical scale) . 3.1394</page><page sequence="8">872202 Figure 11 - Column Force - 24 km/hr Test (Scaled Cadaver Data) Figure 12 - Column Force - 34 krty/hr Test (Scaled Cadaver Data) Figure 13 - Column Force - 40 kiry/hr Test (Scaled Cadaver Data) Figure 14 - Resultant Chest Acceleration 24 km/hr Test (Scaled Cadaver Data) 3.1395</page><page sequence="9">Figure 15 - Resultant Chest Acceleration 34 knyhr Test (Seeded Cadaver Data) Figure 16 - Resultant Chest Acceleration 40 kny/hr Test (Scaled Cadaver Data) Figure 17 - Moment Curves - 24 krtv/hr Test (Scaled Cadaver Data) Figure 18 - Moment Curves - 40 kit/hr Test (Seeded Cadaver Data) 3.1396</page><page sequence="10">The rim transducer (see Figure 3) also measures pitch moment (y-axis) . This channel was missing in some of the early tests preventing as complete a comparison as can be made for the force and acceleration data above. Figure 17 shows the pitch moment for one cadaver and the Hybrid III at 24km/hr. Figure 18 presents the dummy against the cadaver corridor for the 40km/hr condition. The Hybrid III response is slightly higher than the cadavers in this regard. ENERGY- ABSORBING CONSIDERATIONS The human cadaver and the Hybrid III dummy interact with the energy- absorbing steering assembly. There is a certain amount of kinetic energy before the collision and -- assuming the change -of -velocity is used as the measure of velocity [14] -- no kinetic energy after the event. Where does the energy go and how fast does it go ? To determine the answer to this question, we need both column force and column stroke velocity. The steering column displacement was measured against time in all sled tests. The differentiation of the column stroke has special interest with respect to the "rim- to-upper- abdomen" photographic analysis discussed earlier in the section CADAVER /HYBRID III INTERACTION with STEERING ASSEMBLY. If the more rigid lower ribs of the Hybrid III make first contact on the lower rim of the steering wheel, while the lower rim makes first contact with the softer upper abdomen of the cadavers , then the column stroke velocity would be higher for the Hybrid III than for the cadavers for identical collision severity. Figure 19 illustrates the column stroke velocity for a Hybrid III and a cadaver at the 40km/hr condition. Table 5 shows the column stroke velocity for all the sled tests. In each case, the Hybrid III column stroke velocity is higher than the cadaver column stroke velocity at the same sled velocity. This Table gives support to the supposition that the lower rim interacts differently with the lower ribs of the Hybrid III than it does with the upper abdomen of the cadavers . The rate of energy absorption, power, in the steering column energy- absorption unit is P(t)col " F(t)hub * ^ co1 stroke dt where P - power F - force along the column axis Xcol stroke - column stroke and d - differentiation with respect to time, dt 872202 In other words , the column power is calculated by multiplying the axial force by the column stroke velocity. The peak value of column power is recorded in Table 5. Again, the peak column power for the Hybrid III is higher than the cadaver for similar test conditions. Since the Hybrid III and cadaver column force is shown in Figures 11 through 13 to be similar, it follows the Hybrid III peak column power is larger because the Hybrid III column stroke velocity is higher . Having calculated the power which is associated with the absorption of the energy in the steering column energy- absorption unit (which is denoted by column power) , the next step is to calculate the larger power associated with the total motion of the steering column through space .

The column force times the hub velocity gives the total power through the wheel. The peak total power is shown in Table 5. Integration of the column power and the total power give the energy absorbed by the column and the total energy out. For example, in test no. CI85015, the energy absorbed in the column is 132 joules and the total energy absorbed by the sled- column complex is 275 joules. To determine the initial kinetic energy of the thoracic structure, the factor 0.37 -- a roughly average value taken from Table 2 - - is multiplied by one -half the subject mass times the change - in- velocity squared. In Table 5, the subject for CI85015 had an initial kinetic energy of about 806 joules (column called "INITIAL KINETIC ENERGY THORAX" in Table 5). 3.1398</page><page sequence="12">The ratio of energy transferred to the sled-column complex divided by the initial kinetic energy is calculated in the column called "ENERGY TRANSF SLED-COLUMN COMPLEX" in Table 5. For the 24, and 40km/hr tests, the Hybrid III transfers on the average a larger portion of the initial kinetic energy to the sled- column complex than does the cadaver. Expressed another way, the amount of energy absorbed by the subject thorax is the difference in the initial kinetic energy and the energy absorbed by the sled-column complex. For example, in CI85015, roughly 530 joules of the original 806 joules is absorbed by the thorax. The energy absorbed by the thorax divided by the initial kinetic energy gives the fraction of the total initial energy absorbed by the occupant. This fraction is figured in the column called "FRACTION INITIAL KINETIC ENERGY ABSORBED THORAX" in Table 5. For the 24 and 40km/hr tests on the average , a greater proportion of the total initial energy is absorbed by the cadavers than by the Hybrid III. CADAVER INJURY Following each sled run, the cadaver is removed from the sled buck and all the accelerometers are removed from their mounts. The subject is then returned to refrigerator storage. The time lapse between running the test and conducting the necropsy was no longer than three days and usually the following day. The injuries observed are recorded and special note is taken of the relationship of these to any external markings due to the impacting steering assembly. Table 6 summarizes the hard thorax injuries for the twelve cadaver tests. The hard thorax injuries include not only the thoracic contents such as the heart, lungs, and ribs; but also the thoracic spinal column and the abdominal organs contained inside the rib cage such as the liver, kidneys, and spleen. At the 40km/hr test velocity, three of the seven cadavers had liver injury. Additional injury details are gathered in Table 7. Figure 20 shows the the relative occurrence of an injury greater than or equal to a specific AIS level by test severity as measured by initial sled velocity .

One equation for the prediction of thoracic injury is based on a large cadaver data base. [16] Viano [17] observed that the thorax reaches it's maximum deflection limit at about the AIS 3 level at which point the chest bottoms. The Neathery equation is: AIS - 17.4 P/D + 0.0313 Age - 5.15 where P - chest penetration, D - subject chest depth, Age - subject age. Since the measurement of the cadaver chest penetration was not reliable, the average Hybrid III internally measured chest deflection will be used for each sled test condition. To use the Neathery equation, 1.27 cm was added to the chest deflection recorded by the Hybrid III. The 1.27 cm is added to account for skin thickness. The Hybrid III chest depth is about 23.6 cm. The only other variable is Age, for which each cadaver's age was substituted. The predicted results are shown in Table 8. For this limited number of cadaver tests, the Neathery equation predicts high for 24 km/hr but close for 34 and 40km/hr. Does the distribution of injury by body part vary as test severity increases ? To answer this question, Table 9 was constructed from Table 7. Viewed in this way, most of the more significant injuries to the abdomen and the neck occur at the higher speeds while thoracic injuries remain relatively constant. There is a need for future research into these neck and abdominal injury mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS o In these experiments of unrestrained subjects into a steering assembly, the Hybrid III performed in a gross motion sense as the cadavers did. They showed similar "effective" mass based on impulse - momentum considerations. They exhibited similar steering column axis force -versus -time histories. o Localized loading in the sixth rib region of the Hybrid III appeared to couple the steering wheel to a larger thoracic mass than is the case when the wheel contacts the upper abdomen region of the cadaver. The Hybrid III had lower initial peak spinal acceleration. The Hybrid III produced higher pitch moment (on the steering wheel) resulting from the abdomen contacting the lower steering wheel rim. The averages of the steering rim deformations suggested more rim deformation at the top and less deformation at the bottom for the cadaver relative to the Hybrid III . The column stroke velocity was higher for the Hybrid III. 3.1401</page><page sequence="15">o At 40km/hr initial sled velocity, three out of seven of the cadavers had liver injuries. Future research should focus on obtaining additional numbers of cadaver impacts so that the development of an injury index will have a statistically significant basis. o For this experimental setup of the unrestrained occupant impacting the steering assembly, the Hybrid III exhibited a higher peak absorbed column power than did the cadaver. On the average for the 24 and 40km/hr sled tests, the cadaver thorax absorbed a greater proportion of the initial kinetic energy than did the Hybrid III thorax.
