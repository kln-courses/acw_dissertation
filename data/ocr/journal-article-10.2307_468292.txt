<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Clandestine Ox: The Transformations of an African Tale Claude Bremond I. Characteristics of the Type ATALE DIFFUSED throughout West Africa possesses, in its initial episode, the motif of a person entering the body of a living animal (ox, bull, cow, elephant) in order to feed upon it; a theme that in memory of a novel by Marcel Ayme we propose to name The Clandestine Ox. A Bambara version will give a fuller idea of the events which follow this beginning in the canonical intrigue.1 During a famine Hare sneaks into the stomach of a bull belonging to the Spirits, from it cuts chunks of flesh, takes them back home, and feasts on them with his relatives. Intrigued, Hyena's wife comes to borrow fire and obtains at the same time a bit of the meat. Hyena pretends to have a tooth- ache and, seeking out Hare, begs him for a cure. When Hare puts his paw into the mouth of the alleged patient, Hyena bites him and agrees to unlock his jaws only if Hare promises to take him the next morning to the place where he has his food supply. The narrator comments in passing that this violence is superfluous: Hare would have given up his secret willingly. To wait until morning seems too long to Hyena, who cannot fall asleep; since his mother coughs when dawn begins to break, he beats her to make her cough in order to indicate the dawn prematurely. Hare and Hyena finally leave, and both enter the bull's stomach. Hare has carefully warned Hyena that he may satiate himself upon the animal's flesh so long as he does not touch the heart. Hyena takes no notice and slices through the heart, causing the death of the bull and the arrival of the guardian spirits, who are suspi- cious of the cause of the bull's demise and decide to carve up the body. In great danger of being lynched, the two confederates try to hide: at Hare's sugges- tion Hyena takes refuge in the stomach, while Hare himself flees into the gall bladder. The Spirits begin their autopsy and set aside the viscera, throwing away the gall bladder and its contents. Hare frees himself and puts on a show of indignation: while he was peacefully taking his siesta, they thoughtlessly inundated him with ordure. The Spirits apologize to him. Dirtied by gall but clean of suspicion, Hare puts his talents of divination to the service of the inquest: the bull has died from an evil which resides in its stomach. Take that organ, tie it up, strike it! Hyena is beaten to death in his sack of flesh. The grateful Spirits award Hare a portion of the meat. In its current state, our collection of this tale includes ten or twelve ver- sions. Their area of distribution (Wolof, Bambara, Malinke, Mossi, Dogon,</page><page sequence="2">394 NEW LITERARY HISTORY Mbai, Sekyani) covers a wide band, from Senegal in the west to Chad in the east and to Gabon in the south. Besides the invariant motif of the trickster (Spider, Hare, Turtle, Squirrel) who sneaks into the body of an animal to feed upon it, we can distinguish the following themes, which are regularly associated with the tale: (a) the intervention of a second parasite (Hyena, Leopard), a lesser and negative trickster, who obtains from the first, with or against his will, the revelation of his source of food; (b) the opposition between the moderation of the first discoverer, who respects the vital princi- ple of their host, and the frenetic voracity of his accomplice, who commits a lethal excess, when both enter the nourishing body; (c) the contrast between the astuteness of the first discoverer, who devises a way to escape from the cadaver and to turn the situation to his advantage, and the stupidity of his accomplice, who docilely lets himself be led to his ruin. To summarize this newly proposed analysis, we will organize the princi- pal episodes of the intrigue according to the following tree: The Discoverer's Virtues The Accomplice's Flaws Retributions Access of the Moderated use Access of Abusive use Both in Discoverer discoverer to of the animal the accom- of the animal danger in saved; accom- the animal plice to the dead plice lost the animal animal Let us examine in greater detail the possible elaborations of each episode: Access of the discoverer to the animal. The majority of the variants restrict themselves to a laconic prologue: during a time of want the hero (Hare, Spider) sneaks into the ox or cow of a powerful figure (God, Spirit, Chief) through its throat or anus and there cuts off slices (of fat or of red meat) which provide him with food for his family. The use of a magical formula ("white clay and red ochre, open") is only recorded in a single version.2 Other variants give more detailed prologues. Two of them begin with a contest between Hare and Hyena. Having agreed to seek their fortunes in- dependently, the two companions meet again to compare their booty: one returns empty-handed, the other fattened3 or bearing a piece of fat.4 With the variants that substitute an elephant for the ox, the prologue is developed to the point of including an autonomous story: in contrast to the bull, which is only a head of cattle without anthropomorphic status, the elephant is Elephant, a personage of great weight, as stereotyped as is the Hyena or Hare, and one of the most frequent victims of the trickster's pranks. Sometimes tales depict the crafty one thriving on this mountain of flesh. Elsewhere,5 Hare defies Elephant and is swallowed by him, after equipping himself with a well-whetted knife. In the interior he slices through the heart and the liver, and while the colossus collapses, he makes his exit by tearing through the stomach. In still others, the capacities of Elephant's anal opening seem to render the access especially facile: in a Limba tale6 where, paradoxically, he plays the role of a false fool, Elephant</page><page sequence="3">THE CLANDESTINE OX 395 proposes to Spider, who has burned his mortar, that he lend him his anal cavity to grind the rice harvest. During the third grinding, Elephant closes his anus and leaves with the rice, leaving only the straw to Spider. These intellectual and anatomical characteristics explain the substitution of the elephant for the ox in the role of the nourishing animal. The ruse which permits the trickster to sneak into the stomach varies. In the Mbai version7 Squirrel, trapped while stealing Elephant's groundnuts, claims to redeem himself by grooming Elephant, inside as well as outside; he begins with the inside and installs himself there with his equipment: a pot, some embers, and salt. In the three other versions, Hare proposes lessons of chess, or ware, to Elephant. He carefully lets his student win, who belly laughs with his mouth wide open or his anus spread; Hare profits from the other's hilarity to enter one or the other orifice.8 Moderated use of the animal by the first discoverer. The hero proves his craftiness and boldness as explorer of the entrails of an ox or an elephant. He knows how to take a calculated risk. Another attribute frequently signals his positive character: he serves himself with moderation, is content with fat9 or with some pieces of flesh,10 and above all abstains from injuring a vital organ (the heart, or a certain small ball of fat). Furthermore, in four variants" he takes home his booty so that his family profits from it. In so doing, his conduct contrasts with the selfishness of the trickster, who, as a negligent father and hostile husband, is often seen occupied with hiding the lucky find of a magic kettle or some other reserve of food. Access of the accomplice to the animal. Some of our versions say simply that the discoverer invites his accomplice to accompany him, either spontane- ously, or in response to a request by the latter.12 Others stress the "guest's" lack of discretion by including one of the following motifs: In three tales'3 the second personage, puzzled by the prosperity in the first's household, sends his wife to reconnoiter under the pretext of request- ing some embers to relight their fire. In three other tales'4 the second personage, wrongly or rightly doubting that his neighbor will reveal his secret, feigns a toothache; when the neighbor puts a paw into his mouth to treat him, he bites until he obtains a promise to go together the next morning to the source of the food. Finally, in three tales"5 the second personage, unable to wait for the dawn, attempts to hasten the departure through various strategems: he lights a fire that simulates sunrise,'" spreads pepper through the houses to make the old women cough as they do at dawn,'7 beats his own mother that she might cough. 1 These grotesque tricks have an obvious function: to make the second per- sonage a foil, to point up the merits of the first. The accomplice is indiscreet, brutal, incapable of submitting either to the social or the cosmic order. His ultimate excessiveness should not surprise us. Abusive use of the animal. Three tales"9 note only that one of the two con- federates greedily cuts through the heart of the food-animal while the other takes care to respect this vital organ. All the other variants accentuate this opposition by stressing that the first discoverer had properly alerted his</page><page sequence="4">396 NEW LITERARY HISTORY companion: either he had warned him not to touch the heart, while still permitting the meat, the intestines, or the fat,20 or he had warned him that a small ball of fat enclosed the beast's vital principle.21 Escape and exoneration of the first discoverer. Trapped in the dead animal and in danger of being lynched, the two accomplices try to hide themselves in the cadaver. While his confederate chooses a noble viscera, the discoverer is clever enough to make a "modest" choice that assures his salvation. The most frequent method of escape involves hiding in the waste that will be thrown into the brush: the gall bladder'" or the intestines.23 But it can also be the stomach, the large intestine, or the paunch that is given to children to empty or to wash in the river.24 In one of many elaborations on the above theme, the discoverer, desirous of assuring for himself the least glorious but safest hiding place, sometimes feigns to recommend it to his confederate, and to reserve for himself a noble viscera (lung, stomach). He thus leads his partner to think that he is being proposed a fool's bargain and to fall into the trap he thought to avoid: the confederate chases the discoverer from the place that he merely pretended to occupy and lodges there himself, to his ruin.25 Discovery and punishment of the accomplice. Once out of trouble, the discov- erer can be content to proclaim his alibi and to leave the problem of hunting and punishing his accomplice to the food-animal's guardians.2" Most often, he profits from the situation to revenge himself. Acting as diviner, he pin- points the evil in the stomach, the paunch, the lung, the intestines, etc., and counsels them to beat this organ with a stick.27 As compensation for the injury he has suffered or as reward for his diagnosis, he additionally receives a portion of the butchered animal.28 II. Variations of the Type The characteristics of the tale of The Clandestine Ox are now sufficiently detailed. Departing from this general model, we can imagine a series of transitions yielding either individual variants derived from the general model or variants intermediate between this model and others, near or dis- tant. Let us emphasize that these "transformations" ought not to be under- stood as necessarily corresponding to the evolutionary stages of the tale. In certain cases we have reason to think that the forms we are going to examine have issued from the model tale as we have just characterized it. In others, we lack the evidence for any judgment: it can, for example, be difficult to say if a certain transformation represents a historical evolution of the tale, the conservation of an older stage, or a regression which retrieves older forms and combines them with modern elements. We have brought together a diffused collection of narratives at a point in their evolution in time and diffusion in space where a rather large number of compatible variants attests to the realization of a viable model or paradigm. This point of equilibrium and coherence corresponds to what we have named the story of The Clandes- tine Ox. Around this generative nucleus are arrayed in a dusty cloud of</page><page sequence="5">THE CLANDESTINE OX 397 unstable forms the stories, myths, anecdotes which have given birth to it, which have been created by it, which are reborn from it after it has generated them-a galaxy we can only describe and explain by reference to the model tale, taken as a fixed point and as a source ideal at least for all the transforma- tions. Instead of examining one by one every story in this galaxy, we will examine some examples of its most popular transformations: (1) a draining off of the moralizing implications in favor of other meanings; (2) contamina- tions between the model tale and another model type of a different but related theme; and (3) the influence exercised by the model tale's patterns of intrigue and its motifs upon a version of a very different model tale. Draining off of the moral scope. This time we take as an example a Temne story.29 Frog has found the king's magic cow. When he tells it, "Open up," it opens its mouth, and he can seize this opportunity to be swallowed; and the same formula causes him to be spit up again. Inside the cow, Frog cuts off some fat with a small knife and uses it to flavor his meals. His guest Spider demands the source of this fat. Frog discloses his secret and agrees to take him along the next morning. The impatient Spider resorts to the trick of the false sunrise. They finally leave. Frog warns Spider not to touch the cow's heart, because it would die. Spider respects the advice so well that this time the escapade ends without incident. At the moment of parting, Frog tells Spider that he should not expect to repeat their experience the next day. The disappointed Spider decides to ignore this. He returns alone and, forgetting his instructions, slices through the cow's heart. While the king's servants butcher the carcass, Spider, hidden in the entrails, succeeds in escaping. Covered with ordure, he doubles back to the servants, complains that they have soiled him, and obtains in recompense the animal's head. But this is not all: he buries the head by the edge of the road, in swampy land, and calls for help. Some well-intentioned passersby try to help him free his founder- ing cow. The head is left in their hands; Spider accuses them of having, through their brutal awkwardness, caused the death of his cow. A new indemnity: he is awarded three cows in compensation. Moral: thanks to his astuteness, Spider has made a fortune. Clearly this narrative exploits the same range of motifs as The Clandestine Ox, but it orients the intrigue toward a very different lesson. Here the discov- erer is Frog, who in the African folktale does not belong to the category of great tricksters, but rather intervenes, here or there, as an ally. The opposi- tion between Frog, the wise and moderate discoverer, and Spider, the vo- racious and heedless accomplice, is certainly present in the first part (up to the death of the cow), but in a potential state which is only half realized. Frog leaves the scene after pushing Spider to the foreground. From then on the whole question is to find out if Spider, in the awkward position to which his intemperateness has led him, is going to continue to act the fool. Then, not only does he rectify the situation, but turns it to his profit, and, in the process, even finds the way to multiply this profit. The Temne narrative preserves the opposition between moderation and excess, acuity and blunder. But moderation and acuity cease to be two soli-</page><page sequence="6">398 NEW LITERARY HISTORY dary qualities, given or refused together, two aspects of an indivisible wis- dom. Here the initial opposition between the first discoverer-restrained and astute-and an accomplice-unrestrained and stupid-is erased in favor of another, internal to the evolution of a unique hero, at first immoderate and then acute. One learns that the two faces of wisdom do not necessarily dwell together harmoniously. To the contrary: Spider does not possess the modera- tion needed to control his appetite or to desire only the reasonable, but it does not matter. He has the astuteness to master a situation so as to profit from it to the utmost. The lesson of this story, which closes Spider's cycle of adventures with success, is a sort of fluctuat nec mergitur: Spider com- promises himself by his excess, but his intelligence gives him the last word. One might imagine the inverse combination: a hero at first astute, then immoderate, and draw from it a contrary lesson: what good is intelligence if one ruins everything by arrogance brought on by success? Such seems to be the opinion drawn from our story by a Ngambaye variant.30 Having foaled, Antelope-Horse asks Spider's wife to prepare a meal. In recompense, she allows her to enter her stomach and cut a bit of meat. Spider disguises himself as a woman and goes to offer his services to Antelope- Horse. Once in her stomach, he slices through his hostess' heart. She dies. Her relatives assemble. Spider, still in the corpse's stomach, proclaims: "I am the evil which has killed your child. I am coming out to kill you." All flee. Spider climbs out of the body, butchers it, and puts it on to cook with the help of his son. But the latter does not obtain his just portion of the meat. Furious, he goes to his mother, who paints herself white and rises up before Spider as if she were Death coming to find him. It is Spider's turn to flee in terror, while his wife and son carry away the banquet. The Temne narrative signaled its meaning through an apotheosis of two consecutive successes of which one amplifies the other. The Ngambaye ver- sion signals its own meaning through another procedure: the repetition of the same cycle of adventures. The trickster, scarcely out of one bad situation thanks to his genius, hastens to repeat his immoderate actions. This affords the opportunity to any teller who knows his profession to prolong almost indefinitely his recitation by adding other variants drawn from his reper- toire, with no limit other than his own weariness or that of his audience. In this evolution every sort of moral or philosophical gloss on the story gets lost: the paradoxical capacity of producing without stopping the grossest blun- ders and the most sophisticated strategems creates a rather captivating per- sonage, and an intrigue sufficiently rich in gags, variants, and antithetical effects to suffice unto themselves. At the same time that the lesson becomes diluted, the form of the tale breaks down. It loses its proper form, its distribution in episodes which balance off symmetrically, its closure by a clear and definitive sanction. It no longer has an end: the character of the hero is presented as a necklace on which the teller strings alternately, like pearls of contrasting colors, the attributes of inability and superability equally comically surprising, even though they provoke two kinds of quite different laughter. These episodes have no organic sol- idarity: if the thread of the necklace is broken, the pearls which escape from</page><page sequence="7">THE CLANDESTINE OX 399 it are ready for use elsewhere, either as mini-tales, as jokes reduced to a single trick or blunder, as episodes in other tales, or finally as pearls to string into new ensembles. The disintegration of the original story therefore tends to fragment it into a series of floating themes which augment the stock from which every narrator draws. According to his inspiration or to the will of his audience, he cites them in isolation or recombines them in groups of a flimsy stability. Here is what happens to the central motif of The Clandestine Ox in a tale from the Touareg (Air).31 Elephant and Jackal are traveling together. Seek- ing to quench their thirst, they finally discover a pond from which Jackal laps a few mouthfuls. Elephant, to the contrary, drinks the pond dry. They con- tinue their journey. Jackal becomes thirsty again. Elephant has him enter his stomach. Jackal quenches his thirst, and next noticing the fat which plasters his cistern's walls, he begins to carve out slices from it. Elephant vainly protests; Jackal continues until his host dies. Jackal manages to slip out without being seen, but the animals demand an ordeal. Lion commands that Elephant be cut up and that each put his portion to cook: the murderer will be he whose meat remains raw. In fact, Jackal realizes that his portion is not cooking. He covertly substitutes his pot for that of Hyena. Convicted of the murder, Hyena is put to death. It would be misleading to try to articulate this narrative through the an- titheses of moderation/excess and astuteness/stupidity, as we have done up to now. Not that the role of Jackal fails to point out these categories: one might say that Jackal did not see further than the end of his nose in being content with a few laps of water, while Elephant, in making himself an abundant reserve of water, seemed to have acted with more discernment. In the same way, one might consider that Jackal, in the stomach of Elephant, committed excess upon excess. But flaws remain potential to the extent that no sanction is directly tied to them. What is the immediate consequence of Jackal's lack of foresight? He is rewarded for it by the access to the Elephant's fat. What is the immediate consequence of the greed which causes Elephant's death? Instead of remaining trapped in his stomach, Jackal extri- cates and saves himself. Of course, he is next put in danger by the ordeal, and this threat could be understood as the sanction of his greediness. But if nothing invalidates this interpretation, nothing confirms it: it ought to be treated as a potentiality which the narrator has left fallow, and which would be abusive for the commentator to till. The first section of the story is thus revealed to be only a prologue in- tended to introduce the ordeal, an examination which measures Jackal's amoral cleverness against Hyena's foolish candor. This time the opposition is not between a thoughtless Jackal and a discerning Jackal, but between a master con artist and perennial mark. The con does not serve any instructive purpose: it is valuable only for its internal humor; it is its own end. Persistence or rediscovery of etiological meaning. The story which so disin- tegrates is not condemned to degenerate without remedy. Its substance be- comes available for a reemployment which assures the narrative's termina- tion by an etiological conclusion: "And it is since this time that. . . ." The</page><page sequence="8">400 NEW LITERARY HISTORY ineffectual or even humorous character of this final element proves the story's capacity to return to the myth from which it perhaps issued. The trickster, in effect, is above all typified as a power of disorder, as the in- stigator of normative evasions. While the men of today are mediocre, the ancestral animal, much better or much worse, perpetually explores the paths of deviance, through his maladaptations (in his blunders) or through his over- adaptations (in his lucky finds): "Spider, remaining closer to the myth, is at once very intelligent and stupid, full of errors, the slyest and yet the least cautious. ... He brings scandal as well as the unexpected into a society where the individual is defined only by his familial or social status. Incarnat- ing disorder, he introduces movement and life into a universe which, with- out him, would remain congealed."32 The trickster acquires or recovers the stature of a mythical ancestor to whom the world owes its having become, for good or evil, what it is today. It is through him that the discovery and installation of a cosmic order otherwise unjustifiable become understand- able and accepted: his crude whims account for the contingency of things, their "it's like that." The eternal return of the story to the myth: a personage such as Spider, for example, has sufficiently preserved this ambivalence, so characteristic of his homologues, the American Coyote33 or the paleoasiatic Crow,34 to facilitate his eventual reconversion. Let us note, however, without too much effort to explain the fact, that The Clandestine Ox, in the present extent of our corpus, furnishes no example of remythification, although the closely related stories of The Treasure Tree and The Cave of Ali-Baba give rise to very remarkable transformations (or retrans- formations) into myths about the origin of food, with details that clearly show the myth's recovery of the story. This omission is all the more notable because The Clandestine Ox is one of the African tales in which outcroppings of ancient mythical themes or scenarios of initiation rituals disclose them- selves the most readily. Perhaps the symbolic resonances of the story, at least insofar as they maintain their canonical form, are sufficient to maintain its popularity, without any need to specify its import. Without proposing to elucidate the esoteric or unconscious meanings, which in any case vary according to the culture and are susceptible to interpretation at different levels, we offer as a working hypothesis a scheme whose potentialities seem to us very extensive. The adventure of The Clandestine Ox presents at its beginning a situation of famine, rendered all the more abnormal by the fact that a small privileged group possesses food in its most desirable form, meat. The discoverer-hero responds to this inequity according to a mechanism analyzed by Pierre and Elli Maranda35 through inventing modes of access and of consumption that are equally anomalous: he enters his prey to eat it alive. An ideal solution, in one sense, because it assures the eater's protection within the eaten's flanks and guarantees him regular and lasting provisions. But as a solution it is nonviable in the long run: clandestine, it does not provide for the necessity that the discoverer come to terms with his social partners. These partners are, on the one hand, the accomplice, whose envy, voracity, and stupidity will vitiate the discoverer's ingenuity and moderation; and, on the other, the</page><page sequence="9">THE CLANDESTINE OX 401 ox's owner, who remains an enemy insofar as he has not consented in any way to sharing his property. The elimination of the accomplice and the alliance with the one or many owners are the conditions that would have to be realized to legitimate the discoverer's access to the meat. Meanwhile, to be sure, the golden age envisaged for a moment has vanished: the miraculous animal is dead. Henceforth, the ox can be eaten only after it has been killed. Today we feast; tomorrow, famine. The Ox, the Tree, and the Cave. We are now going to compare the motifs and schemes of intrigue of The Clandestine Ox with related narratives or groups of narratives, to determine their relationship. One of the most closely related has been analyzed by Genevieve Calame-Griaule under the title The Treasure Tree. The author summarizes its canonical intrigue in the following way: The African story, in its essential structures, features two heroes. The first (the youngest) after his initial choice of the good road and after passage through many tests, has a conversation with the tree which offers him its goods in succession and concludes by opening its trunk, in which riches and jewels are found (and sometimes preferred food). In contrast, the quest of the second or negative hero has led only toward anti-adornments (or toward anti-food). Upon returning to the village, the two heroes adorn their wives, who compare their jewels, thus provoking the jealousy of the negative hero's wife, who complains to her husband. The latter, thanks to the trick of the feigned toothache, bites the hand of the first hero, who discloses the tree's secret. But the negative hero again will fail because of his greed in wishing to carry off the entire tree on his back. He will be obliged to put it back in its place and to die from his effort.36 From the condensation of The Treasure Tree into an archetype that unites the best variants, we will draw a graphic tree and compare it with the one used to represent The Clandestine Ox: T First Episode Second Episode Discoverer's Virtues Discoverer's Accomplice's Flaws Accomplice's I I Reward I I Punishment Preliminary Preliminary Preliminary Preliminary Virtue Reward False-Virtue False-Reward + + Second Supreme Effective Supreme Virtue Reward Flaw Punishment I I I I Access to Controlled Gift of the Access to Gift of Accomplice the Tree Use of the Jewels and the Tree Jewels and Crushed under Thanks to First Goods Ornaments Despite Ornaments Tree a Modest Arrogance + Choice and Stupidity Intentions of Carrying Away the Tree The relationship between the two schemes, underlined by the equivalence of certain motifs, is not in doubt. Calame-Griaule herself stresses in the</page><page sequence="10">402 NEW LITERARY HISTORY conclusion to her study the importance of comparing the two stories. But the parallel which especially draws her attention is that between The Treasure Tree and the African versions of The Cave of Ali-Baba: "the movement from one theme to the other is easy to understand. On both sides there is a hollow container (tree or cave) enclosing a treasure and two opposed heroes who attempt to steal from it different fortunes, the negative hero being punished either by the tree itself or by the treasure's owners (spirits or thieves)." Against this base, a triangular comparison relating The Clandestine Ox to the two other stories is surely welcome. But Calame-Griaule in following her parallel stresses the divergences: the use of "Open, Sesame" in the instance of The Cave, dialogues and imposed trials in that of The Tree. Yet more explicitly: "the fundamental difference resides in the fact that the tree's prizes are offered by the tree itself to the hero who has earned them, while the cave's treasures are stolen by the positive hero, whose principal virtue con- sists of knowing when to leave, while the other dawdles." One last contrast, rather more hypothetical, concerns the nature of the treasures: "In the Afri- can version, they consist essentially of ornaments (jewels and beautiful clothes) and secondarily of prestigious foods; in the eastern version, gold and minted coins dominate."37 How can The Clandestine Ox be placed within this game of oppositions? First, in contrast to Tree, which offers mostly jewels and ornaments, and to Cave, which contains either gold or minted coins, Ox does not render to its visitors manufactured products, but instead the most natural of goods: a meat which is its own being, its insides, its flesh. Its originality resides in the identification of the contained treasure with the envelope which contains it, just as the originality of Tree resides in the identification of the enclosure containing the treasure with the owner of this enclosure. Perhaps the most banal in this respect, Cave maintains a contrast among the three terms: the treasure is not its own enclosure, the enclosure is not the treasure's owner. One might thus diagram a table of the possible combinations: Treasure and Enclosure Enclosure and Owner Cave r Tree = Ox = The fourth permutation, which corresponds to an archetypal narrative in which treasure, enclosure, and owner would be but a single person, might be considered as realized in the variants in which the domestic bovine is replaced by Elephant or Antelope-Horse, which itself invites the trickster to penetrate into its stomach; but these narratives inevitably feature the inter- vention, after the victim's death, of a substitute for the owner, the group which demands a reckoning. A second criterion relates Ox to Cave and sets it off against Tree. The inclinations of the enclosure's owner are potentially welcoming in Tree (he offers treasure to whoever knows how to please him). But in contrast they are hostile in Ox and Cave, and this particularity tends to eliminate the proba-</page><page sequence="11">THE CLANDESTINE OX 403 tional examination of the first discoverer: no longer a dialogue with the enclosure's master, who is absent, nor with the enclosure itself, which does not have the status of a person able to offer or refuse itself. One can only enter it surreptitiously, therefore always by trickery, and with the risk of being caught redhanded. This opposition dictates, or at least authorizes, a different allotment of the narrative's themes. In The Treasure Tree the preliminaries of the quest are highly developed: above all the discoverer's virtue and reward are stressed. As a consequence, the final episode (the flaw and punishment of his ac- complice) is summarily expedited. Furthermore, the positive hero is re- moved to the background, if he does not leave the scene entirely, as soon as the negative hero begins his conversation with the tree. In Cave, and espe- cially in Ox, the contrary disposition tends to prevail: a few rapid sketches take care of the discoverer's first penetration into the enclosure, eventually thanks to a magical formula. Is there more astuteness than luck in his happy find? One does not know. In any case, his virtue is underlined in two ways: at first, in the moderated use he makes of the meat and of the treasure to which he has access; second, in the cleverness that he displays in getting himself out of trouble when he is compromised by his companion's excess. This shift is especially striking between The Treasure Tree and The Clandes- tine Ox: in the first, the hero modestly opts for the narrow path and cleverly beguiles his partner into choosing the wide path and finds the means of entering into the tree. In the second, the hero modestly selects the ignoble viscera, astutely beguiles his partner to hide himself in a noble organ, and finds the means of leaving the ox. The lesson is the same, but differently located in the chain of events. The situation is more complex in The Cave. As in Tree, the negative hero is alone in the cave when he is captured: the first discoverer did not return with him, or has already left. So only the negative hero can be put to trial. Furth- ermore, the trial separates less clearly the two complementary aspects of virtue: moderation and astuteness. Sometimes the confederate delays un- reasonably his stay in the cave in order to consume or collect its riches, and this rapacity brings about his ruin. It is an immoderate desire, analogous to that of trying to carry a tree away on one's back, or of eating an entire ox, heart and all. Sometimes the confederate is trapped in the cave by forgetting the magical formula: a failure to adapt means to situational ends, comparable to choosing the road which does not lead to the tree, or of hiding in a place without exit from the ox. We must observe that the two sorts of flaw (or of virtue) can be tested through a single trial. The Galland version of The Thousand and One Nights, for example, brings about a synthesis in presenting the greedy Cassim's failure to remember the formula as resulting from the shock of seeing the treasure. "Because his mind was filled with every idea except the one that was most to his benefit, he found, upon reaching the door to open it, that he had forgotten the crucial word and, instead of 'Sesame,' he said, 'Open, Barley' " (365th Night). Some of our African variants arrive at the same end through different means: the accomplice has the discoverer accompany him</page><page sequence="12">404 NEW LITERARY HISTORY into the enclosure, since only the discoverer has the power of entry (because he knows the password, or has the wings necessary for entrance, etc.). When it becomes dangerous to linger, the accomplice refuses to leave and his mentor departs alone. Unable to leave the enclosure, the accomplice is caught in the act upon the owner's return. Immoderation and stupidity thus combine into a single act. The first discoverer of the cave, even if he has acted with moderation (in using discretion, in not delaying), has not yet furnished tangible proof of his astuteness. This lacuna is corrected, in many of our best African variants, through the introduction of a new episode. Captured by the owner, the accomplice tries to gain favor by denouncing the discoverer. But the latter, as soon as he returns home, goes straight to bed and feigns an alibi, namely, that an illness has immobilized him for many days. Having aggravated his guilt with slander, the accomplice is summarily executed. So, just as in The Thousand and One Nights Ali-Baba's prudence, made ineffective by Cassim's stupidity, is backed up with Morgiane's wiles, and this double proof of moderation and cleverness permits the final possession of the treasure, in the same way the most balanced African variants portray the discoverer as still challenged even when he has had the wisdom to leave in time. He must yet maneuver so as to thwart the consequences of his comrade's immoderation, stupidity, and ingratitude. The moment to demonstrate his presence of mind, which permits access to the treasure in The Treasure Tree and exit from the enclosure in The Clandestine Ox, is granted to Cave's positive hero in the form of a kind of "make-up exam" after the episodes in the cave itself. Let us now abstract the multiple borrowings that all variants of these three contiguous stories carry out among themselves. There emerge three ideal configurations that we may term conventionally The Treasure Tree, The Cave of Ali-Baba, and The Clandestine Ox, each with the following distinctive traits: The Treasure Tree The Clandestine Ox The Cave of Ali-Baba Competition between two heroes Positive hero finds the Positive hero finds the ox Positive hero finds the tree cave Trials mastered through Access through the mouth Access thanks to a magical modesty and diplomacy or anus formula Reward in ornaments and Restrained use of flesh Restrained use of gold jewels and fat and silver Negative accomplice re- turns empty-handed Jewels given the positive Under the pretext of seek- hero's wife elicit the jeal- ing embers, the negative ousy of the negative hero's hero's wife obtains meat wife Revelation obtained Revelation obtained Revelation obtained through the faked tooth- through the faked tooth- through the faked tooth- ache ache ache</page><page sequence="13">THE CLANDESTINE OX 405 The Treasure Tree The Clandestine Ox The Cave of Ali-Baba Hasty departure by the Hasty departure by the Hasty departure by the trick of a false sunrise, etc. trick of a false sunrise, etc. trick of a false sunrise, etc. The negative hero is guid- The negative hero and the The negative hero enters ed to the tree positive hero enter into the cave the ox Trials failed due to im- Both in danger due to the The negative hero delays moderation and arrogance negative hero's excess, and is trapped by forget- which kills the ox ting the formula The positive hero saves himself thanks to an astute and modest choice The negative hero remains trapped thanks to an im- modest choice Surprised by the owner, the negative hero de- nounces his comrade The positive hero exoner- ates himself with a faked alibi The negative hero is The negative hero is beat- The negative hero is put crushed under the tree en to death to death Let us emphasize the ideal character of these configurations: each is capa- ble of temporarily attracting into its orbit the imagination of the narrator, himself launched through one or another motif into a common ground which belongs to all three. The final trajectory of the narrative, like that of an astral body, will depend upon the gravitational forces which at any given moment pull upon it, without necessarily determining its future direction. Will it continue upon its course, or will it be captured by a superior power of attraction? A fine example of the borrowings between the theme of The Treasure Tree and The Clandestine Ox is given in a S~noufe narrative:38 Hare finds himself under a baobab tree. The tree opens itself up, Hare enters and cuts out bits of meat and fat which he takes back home. Hyena's wife sees Hare's wife cook- ing. She beats her husband and berates him for depriving her of meat. Hyena asks Hare to disclose his secret, and Hare agrees to take him to the baobab tree. Hyena enters and, ignoring the baobab's advice not to touch its heart, begins to cut right through it. The baobab closes in upon Hyena and swallows him. The general scheme of this story is that of The Treasure Tree according to two of our criteria: the tree is potentially well disposed to offer the riches it contains; the two heroes follow one another into the enclosure in such a way that the negative hero's excess does not endanger the positive hero. But on the other hand, the third criterion is not satisfied: the treasure is not com- posed of jewels, ornaments, or cooked food, but of raw meat. This meat is</page><page sequence="14">406 NEW LITERARY HISTORY the very flesh of Baobab, who has both fat and a heart. Here the influence of The Clandestine Ox's motifs is quite remarkable. The author utilizes the an- thropomorphism of the baobab to attribute to it not just thought, but will and volition within a body of flesh, animated by a heart which is its vital principle: he thus merges Tree and Ox. But he also profits from this an- thropomorphism to make the Baobab itself issue the warning to respect its heart: in this way he fuses the announcement of the danger, such as it is given in Ox by the first discoverer, with the trial characteristic of The Trea- sure Tree. What is the consequence of transgressing the prohibition? When Hyena slices through the Baobab's heart, it closes up and imprisons him. Without doubt, the tree is avenging an affront rather than reacting to a physical wound; but this episode, which evokes the entrapment of the thieves in the raided cadaver, confirms again the attraction of motifs from The Clandestine Ox in this variant of Tree. III. Chance Borrowings from the Type: The Example of Cobra The borrowings which we have just examined are easily explained: they are inevitable given the extreme proximity of the themes. But the power of attraction of The Clandestine Ox can be demonstrated in variants of tales which share no such common themes. It is only a question of an inventive narrator who collates two motifs and brings about the necessary transposi- tions. A group of tales native to the same region as The Clandestine Ox, of which we have ten or twelve variants (Hausa, Limba, Togo, Ashanti, Senoufo, Ngambaye) develop around the following intrigue: in exchange for an im- mediate gratification, the trickster thoughtlessly draws up a contract which places his life as security at his creditor's mercy. When the time comes, he must find some expedient to get out of the bargain. So he utilizes a dupe- either the creditor, whom he does away with or subdues, or a third party whom he gets to pay his debt. For an example, here is the summary of tale number 43: Death offers an ox to whoever will agree to become his victim one year later. Hare alone appears crazy enough to accept. He feasts with his relatives, but is careful to set aside the flanks and hang them in a neighbor- ing tree. The wind starts to blow; the flanks tumble down like ripe fruits, to the great profit of Hyena who happens to be passing by. Glutted, he raises claims over the land which bears the miraculous tree. Hare, after simulating a countersuit, abandons it to him. When Death appears to claim the master of the place, it is Hyena who is destroyed. Aside from the initial motif of the ox's consumption, nothing in this story seems to recall themes from The Clandestine Ox. Let us examine, though, how a Hausa variant39 assimilates various characteristic motifs of our tale by very evident transformations. Cobra offers his bull to whoever is willing to wel- come him into his stomach. Only Spider accepts, kills the bull, and feasts</page><page sequence="15">THE CLANDESTINE OX 407 upon it with his wife. When Cobra comes to collect his debt, Spider has him told that he is not at home. Denounced by Toucan, he is now obliged to swallow Cobra. How can he extricate himself from this affair? Spider dis- guises himself as a prostitute, solicits a chief's son, besmears his own and his lover's anus with honey so thoroughly that Cobra, enticed by the honey, passes from one body into the other. The freed Spider takes his leave, changes his disguise, and returns as a doctor proposing his services to cure the chief's son. He again coats with honey the boy's anus and a goatskin's orifice, joins them one to the other, and when Cobra has passed into the goatskin, he has it tied up and the contents beaten to death. The grateful chief offers horses and cattle. Spider refuses the horses but carries off the cattle. Cobra's initial offer is part of a cycle that we can call "my ox today against your life in a year," under the conditions that it is not envisaged just in this form and that its how be abstracted. The announcement of the terms of repayment ("you will lodge me in your stomach") actuates a shift through which, among many other possible solutions that are exploited elsewhere, the intrigue is attracted to the motifs of The Clandestine Ox. Three poles of attraction conjoin their effects: One, Hare, endangered in the ox's stomach which contains him, evokes the inverse situation of Spider endangered by Cobra whom he contains in his stomach. In the two cases, salvation consists in finding some way to separate the container from the contained: if one is the container, he evacuates the contained into another container; if one is the contained, he evacuates him- self into another container. Two, Hare, endangered through Hyena's greed, hides with him in the ox's stomach they have been eating up; this episode evokes Spider endangered through Cobra's greed in his own stomach. A vengeful action is desirable. In the two cases, the most elegant punishment consists of punishing the guilty party in the very way in which he has committed wrong: to transform the nourishing asylum into a prison and to put him to death 4vithin the prison. Three, Hare joins the healing diviners; he obtains from his dupes the punishment of his abusive accomplice, receiving in recompense, instead of the punishment which he had merited, a portion of that meat which was his goal in the first place. These final episodes of The Clandestine Ox are never configured in the givens of the other tale. But the assimilation of the first elements borrowed from The Clandestine Ox paves the way for other borrow- ings if, of course, the necessary transpositions are made. In the present case, one might observe that the problem posed by Cobra's presence in Spider's stomach can be resolved through an immediate recourse to the ruse of the besmeared goatskin; there is no need of the detour through the chief's son's stomach. The episode of Spider masquerading as a woman is superfluous. But this supplementary link, quite besides its burlesque flavor, serves a very precise function. It places the actors in a manner identical to that of the final scenes of The Clandestine Ox: the enemy imprisoned in the patient's stomach; his relatives wondering about the cause of his malady; finally, the trickster, guilty of the evil he is going to diagnose but absolved of all suspicion,</page><page sequence="16">408 NEW LITERARY HISTORY returns to the scene that he has just left in order to act as a diviner and to draw from the adventure both vengeance and profit. To characterize the creditor as a leech clamped to its victim is rather trite. This portrayal follows the ordinary model of eating: the eater enclosing the eaten (in another Hausa variant of the tale, Cobra simply proposed in the contract that he should come to "bite" Spider if he should fail his obliga- tions: the rest of the story is even more banal). The interest of The Clandestine Ox, the secret of its fascination, derives from its imagery of a perfect sort of nutrition: the eater, just like a tapeworm but unlike a leech, inside the eaten. This novel motif might be formulated as "the hero causes himself to be swallowed by his victim so as to find sustenance within its body." The hope for a return to the womb seems so crude that we need not stress it. It is enough to point out that the story's lesson does not conclude with the pure and simple condemnation of such a regression. Having found the way of reestablishing the primordial mode of alimentation, when everyone around him is dying of hunger, the first discoverer demonstrates his matur- ity in his disciplined use of his infantile privilege. His nutritive source has a threefold advantage: one, it furnishes him a strictly protein diet, comparable to that directly supplied by the maternal belly to the embryo; two, it puts the eater within the eaten, and thus in the shelter of its flanks; and three, it sustains its life while giving its flesh, and so remains available for indefinite nourishment. Many other African narratives attest to the necessity of husbanding the mother's nutritive capacities. In one such tale40 Spider metamorphoses into an abandoned baby so that he might be adopted by his own wife and so be given their reserve of rice. All would have gone well if Spider, an incorrigible glutton, had not obstinately refused to grow. His wife finally consults an oracle, who reveals the fraud to her. Spider breaks the umbilical cord by pulling on it too hard. Even more significantly, a widely diffused story describes the convulsions which overcome the society of animals when they, through the instigation of a trickster, give way to the temptation to eat their mothers. The trickster, who alone has kept his own mother apart from the massacre and who is secretly fed by her, remains fat while his companions waste away. These two narratives and The Clandestine Ox can be apprehended as three variations upon a single theme. In the last story, the adult, considering himself an adult, experiences what would happen to him if he gave way to the desire of eating his mother in the usual mode of alimentation (the eater outside the eaten). In the preceding tale, the adult, longing to be a nursling endowed with an adult appetite, experiences a regression to the time when his mother nourished him as an infant; in The Clandestine Ox, finally, the adult, imagining himself a fetus endowed with an adult appetite, carries the same experience to its extreme. Each time the outcome is the same: his voracity loses everything in demanding too much. A trite and powerful lesson, susceptible to multiple applications and infinite amplifications: one must moderate one's use of mothers or, more generally, all sources of</page><page sequence="17">THE CLANDESTINE OX 409 nourishment--or more generally yet, all resources that are permanent but limited. The Clandestine Ox is one of the African versions of our Goose Who Laid the Golden Eggs. ECOLE DES HAUTES ETUDES EN SCIENCES SOCIALES, CENTRE D'ETUDES TRANSDISCIPLINAIRES, PARIS (Translated by J.
