<plain_text><page sequence="1">VITRUVIAN STUDIES (PLATE 45) THE interpretations that I offer in the following pages are very tentative, though not, I hope, obscure; and I feel myself wide open to further persuasion on any of them. But unless someone worries some of Vitruvius' more difficult passages and reaches conclusions that are fairly clear, however provisional, we shall make little progress at this stage. His actual text is now surpris- ingly well known, and Soubiran and Fensterbusch are pushing their labours on it as far as is humanly possible. It is his architecture that now needs discussion. I begin, however, with a small textual question. I. VITRUVIUS V. Xi. 2 'In palaestra peristylia, quemadmodum supra scriptum est, ita debent esse perfecte distri- buta' (Rose's text).' 'Perfecte' edd., 'Perfecta' GH. C. Ruffel and J. Soubiran, on p. 29 of their 'Recherches sur la tradition manuscrite de Vitruve' in Pallas ix (Toulouse, 196o), suggested that 'perfecta distributa' could be a tautology, one word glossing the other. It does not seem a very obvious gloss to me, and I wonder if the right reading could be 'perpetua', in the common Vitruvian sense of 'continuous'. For this see, e.g., v. i. Io-'ipsae vero columnae in altitudine perpetua sub trabes', or 'the carrying of the columns themselves in unbroken height directly up to the beams', as Morgan translates it. Or take the Greeks with their 'emplecton' wall in II. viii. 7: 'e suis frontibus perpetuam et unam crassitudinem parietum consolidant. Praeterea interponunt singulos crassitudine perpetua utraque parte frontatos, quos diatonous appellant', etc. In v. xi. I Vitruvius has prescribed that the four colonnades around the inside court of the palaestra should form a single continuous ambulatory. In s 2 he is recapitulating: 'As I prescribed above, continuous unbroken peristyles must be laid out inside the palaestra. But outside it three colonnades are to be laid out', etc. II. VITRUVIUS V. i. I 'Graeci in quadrato amplissimis et duplicibus porticibus fora constituunt crebrisque columnis et lapideis aut marmoreis epistyliis adornant et supra ambulationes in contignationibus faciunt.' 'The Greeks lay out their forums in the form of a square surrounded by spacious double colonnades, adorn them with columns set rather closely together, and with entablatures of stone or marble, and construct walks above in the upper storey' (translation by M. H. Morgan). 'The Greeks plan the forum on the square with most ample double colonnades and close-set columns; they ornament them with stone or marble architraves, and above they make promen- ades on the boarded floors' (translation by Frank Granger). In these stoas of Vitruvius' 'Greek Forum', did the lower colonnades have only architraves above them, or full entablatures like those in two-tiered Pergamene Stoas? And what is the meaning of 'contignatio' ? 'Epistylia' in Vitruvius normally refers to the blocks of the architrave-in III. iii. 4 and 5, for I I use the 1867 edition, as being most generally accessible.</page><page sequence="2">180 HUGH PLOMMER instance: '... epistylia propter intervallorum magnitudinem franguntur. In araeostylis autem nec lapideis nec marmoreis epistyliis uti datur, sed inponendae de materia trabes perpetuae.' In the Ionic order (III. v. 8) 'epistyliorum ratio sic est habenda, uti . . . epistylii sit altitudo dimidia crassitudinis imae columnae', and above the frieze the dentil is to be made as high as the middle fascia of the 'epistylium'. Similarly, in Doric, above the 'epistylium' are to be placed the triglyphs and metopes (Iv. iii. 4). It is true that, as we see from IU. v. 13, from Iv. i. 2, and from Iv. iii. 6, Vitruvius has no collective word for 'entablature'. But it is still unthinkable that he should mean 'entablature' by the word 'epistylia' in v. i. I. The point is an important one. Vitruvius seems to have known Greek stoas of two storeys, where the two tiers of columns were separated only by an architrave, as they were inside Doric temples about 500 B.c. The unhappy Pergamene stoas, with their full entablatures, may not have been considered the Hellenistic norm. 'Contignatio' in ii. ix. 6 means a timber framework; of what sort is not specified. But it should be horizontal. For, Vitruvius tells us, the silver fir is not readily bent by a load, 'sed directa permanet in contignatione'-'remains straight in its horizontal framework' would seem the most natural translation. Horizontal planks seem to be meant by the 'tigna' in I. v. 4-'Etiamque contra interiora turrium dividendus est murus intervallis tam magnis quam erunt turres, ut itinera sint interioribus partibus turrium contignata, neque ea ferro fixa.' Morgan thinks that this means that the towers should have only a wooden flooring across their rear, Granger that 'these intervals shall be joined with planks'. 'Tignum' is also used in Iv. ii. I and 2 of the hori- zontal cross-beams supposed to have rested on the architrave-beams ('trabes ... supra colum- nas') in the pre-Doric timber roof, and to be represented in stone Doric by the fronts of the triglyphs. I do not see why such 'tigna' should always have to rest on 'trabes' in this way.2 At this point we have to consider the possibility-remote, I think-that by 'contignationibus' in our passage Vitruvius means the two upper members of an entablature. Then we should need to translate as follows: 'The Greeks adorn their fora with close-set columns and stone or marble architraves, and above these by walks supported on a timber frieze and cornice.' This would be the exact reverse of the Republican Forum at Pompeii, where the architrave was of timber planks, the frieze and cornice of stone. Moreover, waterproofing demands that even in a composite entablature, as in the archaic temple of Artemis Laphria at Calydon, the cornice at any rate should be of stone. Nor is it at all probable that, just because some theorists of Vitruvius' time considered the triglyphs to have originated as the fronts of'tigna', 'contignatio' could ever have enjoyed general use for a stone frieze and cornice considered together. So I find myself forced back on the meaning of 'a horizontal frame or floor of timber joists'; and the argument that Vitruvius cannot mean a whole roof-truss by it is strengthened by the context of v. i. i. For if, with Morgan, we have to think of walks in an upper storey, what upper storey could we envisage by 'contignationes' but a frame or truss of timber? And in what Greek building could one conceivably arrange such walks, presumably well-lit with windows giving on to the agora inside the timber structure of the roof? Hypostyle halls might have their opaia. But for well-lit walks, with galleried timber fronts and dormer windows, one had to wait for Chester and the Hospice de Beaune. Besides, I am morally certain that Vitruvius envisaged an upper storey with stone columns in these Greek stoas. As I read ss I and 2, both Greek and Italian fora were to have two tiers of stone colonnades, much more widely spaced in the Italian. 2 Krohn, in his Preface, assumes that they must always do so in Vitruvius, and uses the instructions to make wooden architraves three 'tigna' thick ('ex tribus tignis bipedalibus compactis trabes') as his chief argument against Vitruvius' basilica at Fano (v. ii. 8).</page><page sequence="3">VITRUVIAN STUDIES 181 Such a structure could surely not be said to have an 'ambulatio in contignationibus', if con- tignatio meant 'roof-truss'. I am nowhere prepared to translate it as 'roof-truss', not even where most tempted-in vI. iii. 2: 'Testudinata (sc. cava aedium) vero ibi fiunt, ubi non sunt impetus magni et in contigna- tionibus supra spatiosae redduntur habitationes.' 'One builds testudinate atria where strains FIG. I. TEMPLE OF APHAIA: DETAIL OF INTERNAL COLONNADE (AFTER FIECHTER) are not great, and one obtains spacious rooms above, on horizontal wooden floors' (viz. between the flat ceiling of the atrium and its hipped roof). It would be desirable to think of the outer walls continuing upwards several feet above the level of the ceiling-joists, as in compluviate atria, giving a good space between ceiling and rafters. In this passage even Granger translates 'furnish roomy apartments in the storey above'. But I think contignatio always means 'floor' or 'ceiling' in Vitruvius; and in vI. iii. 2 the same mem- ber serves as a floor and a ceiling.3 In v. i. I Granger is to be followed. 3 FIG. I shows how a mere architrave between two tiers could be combined with a contignatio, a timber floor, as early as c. 500 B.C.</page><page sequence="4">182 HUGH PLOMMER Before I leave v. i. 1-3, I must remark that even in his 'Italian Forum' Vitruvius follows the pattern of the time-honoured Doric temple interior. In the two tiers of columns, the upper are to be three-quarters the height of those below, partly because the latter will have a heavier load to bear, but 'not less' because in the trunks of conifers (the cypress, pine, and silver fir), as they grow upwards, there is one even taper from the foot to the summit. This comparison of columns and trees, to us, perhaps, obvious, is interesting in Vitruvius. For it seems at first sight to contradict his famous anthropomorphic account (in Iv. i) of the origins of the three orders. If Vitruvius erred because he did not, like Andrae and Puchstein, derive Ionic from the time- honoured 'Sacred-Tree', at least he erred with his eyes open. Meanwhile, I hope that somewhere an archaeologist will discover some Hellenistic stoa of two storeys, a stoa not Pergamene but Vitruvian. III. VITRUVIUS IV. i. 7 'Basi spiram supposuerunt pro calceo, capitulo volutas uti capillarnento concrispatos cincin- nos praependentes dextra ac sinistra conlocaverunt et cymatiis et encarpis pro crinibus dis- positis frontes ornaverunt truncoque toto strias uti stolarum rugas matronali more demiserunt.' This is the famous passage in which Vitruvius assigns an anthropomorphic origin (in this case, the figure of a matron) to the Ionic column.4 I must postpone my defence of his main thesis, with which I agree, to another occasion. Here I shall only try to elucidate the passage. s 6 has just treated the proportions of the Temple of Apollo Panionius, near Ephesus-the oldest self-consciously Doric temple, according to Vitruvius. The Ionian colonists gave it columns six lower diameters in height, because the body of a grown man is six feet high (see my Section IV, below), and columns similarly proportioned would have a 'probata venustas' (a familiar and well-tried beauty) and seem strong enough to carry the load upon them. Vitruvius continues, in s 7, that they wished to build a novel temple to Diana, and 'quaerentes novi generis speciem isdem vestigiis ad muliebrem transtulerunt gracilitatem', making the column's thickness the eighth part of its height. 'Isdem vestigiis' is a significant phrase, and I do not think that Vitruvius' recent translators have appreciated it. He has just remarked that, to create the Doric column, the builders had measured the print ('vestigium') of the male foot and related it to the height of the column. I think that by 'isdem vestigiis' he means that the size and arrangement of the columns' lower faces, where they rested on the stylobate, were virtually the same in Doric and Ionic. Indeed, the normal Ionic of Asia Minor does have columns as massive on plan and as thickly spaced as those of the first Greek Doric. It is in elevation that the orders differed; and Vitruvius proceeds to describe and account for the elevation of Ionic, beginning with the passage that I now consider. Before I attempt to translate it, I need to comment on four of its terms. (i) 'Spiram.' Spira is the Vitruvian for what we should call the Ionic base. II. v. I-3 describe various sorts of spirae. The 'basis' is the lower face of the shaft, where it rests (as in Ionic, here) upon the base, or (as in Doric, in s 6)5 upon the stylobate. (ii) 'Pro calceo.' Calceus is a complete shoe, as opposed to a mere sandal. Some early Ionic bases are not, perhaps, wholly unlike the front of a shoe in profile. (iii) 'Cymatiis.' What are these cymatia? They seem to be normal decoration for the front of 4 FIG. 2, a fairly typical Ionic capital, from Sardis, should remind readers of its various members and their treatment; and PLATE 45a, a good copy of the Temple on the Ilissus, of the whole order, treated somewhat austerely. s 'Qua crassitudine fecerunt basim scapi, tanta sex cum capitulo in altitudinem extulerunt.'</page><page sequence="5">VITRUVIAN STUDIES 183 an Ionic capital. A cymatium, in the singular, forms an ingredient of the Ionic capital in im. v. 7- 'Capituli autem crassitudo sic est facienda, ut ex novem partibus et dimidia tres partes prae- pendeant infra astragalum summi scapi, cymatio, adempto abaco et canali, reliqua sit pars. Proiectura autem cymatii habeat extra abaci quadram oculi magnitudinem.' Morgan's translation gives an admirably clear picture. 'The height of the capital is to be such that, of the nine and a half parts, three parts are below the level of the astragal at the top of the FIG. 2. IONIC CAPITAL, SARDIS (AFTER BUTLER) shaft, and the rest, omitting the abacus and the channel, belongs to its echinus. The projection of the echinus beyond the fillet of the abacus should be equal to the size of the eye.' Rhys Car- penter agrees with this translation,6 and so does D. S. Robertson, on p. 382 of his Glossary (GRA 382, s.v. 'Cymatium'-'A moulding: used by Vitruvius and by many modern writers especially of the 'echinus' of the Ionic Capital'). I have certain misgivings. (i) What portion of the capital does Vitruvius assign to the 'astra- gal'? I presume that the 'three parts' are measured from its lower edge. He cannot, surely, include it in the 'cymatium'. Structurally, too, it is part of the shaft in normal Ionic. (ii) If we 6 'Vitruvius and the Ionic Order' (AJA 1926, 263). 'If the ovolo begins flush with the extreme projection of the astragal (bead and reel), . .. there will be less than two modules left over for the projection of the egg and dart, whose outermost point is fixed [III. v. 7, proiectura cymatii]. The echinus therefore need not exceed two modules in its height.'</page><page sequence="6">184 HUGH PLOMMER take Vitruvius' words carefully, surely 'reliqua sit pars' should mean that, of the 9- parts that make up the height of the whole capital, only one is left to the echinus. But this makes the echinus ridiculously small. Or else we have to believe that having used 'pars' with great precision in the clause immediately preceding it, Vitruvius now uses the same word very loosely, to mean 'the remainder'. This seems intolerable. Combined with the tortured order of the words hereabouts, it makes me suspect a deep-seated corruption-perhaps the omission of some vital words. (iii) What is the 'quadra abaci'? The normal Ionic abacus has no 'square- moulding', or fillet: and on plan it is a square both at the foot and the top. In profile it is all 'cymatium'. But Hermogenean capitals differ here from the norm. Those of Teos, for instance, have a pronounced fillet, a recognizable 'square', and it actually falls a distance of one 'eye' inside the edge of the echinus. So we can see what Vitruvius means, if we believe (as perhaps we should) that he is following Hermogenes.7 I must agree, on balance, that the 'cymatium' of Vitruvius is what we normally call the echinus. The word cymatium is used, as Robertson says (loc. cit.), in the Erechtheum inscriptions both of the ovolo and the cyma reversa. So it could apply to the ovolo of the normal Ionic echinus. Again, if Vitruvius did not mean the echinus by it in m. v. 7, then all mention of the echinus has dropped out of the passage. Finally, it would be natural for him in Iv. i. 7 to talk about the 'cymatia', the two stretches of echinus on the front and rear of the single capital that he is describing. For at the sides it disappeared almost completely under the pulvinus in the capitals designed by his contemporaries. Nor need we be surprised that he used the word 'echinus' of Doric, not of Ionic. In Doric the echinus is much more real and definite. Fortunately, then, I can agree with most scholars that the 'cymatiis' of Iv. i. 7 refer to the Ionic echinus. But it is salutary to see the dangers that we run from Vitruvius' obscurities. (iv) 'Encarpis.' These seem to come from the neuter plural 'encarpa', and are translated by Granger as 'festoons', by Morgan as 'festoons of fruit'. But, unlike the echinus, with which Vitruvius has bracketed them, such festoons are by no means necessary to the design of an Ionic capital. Indeed, I know no ancient instance of it, though certain Renaissance capitals, presumably in an attempt to embody Vitruvius' prescriptions, contain such garlands suspended between the eyes of the two volutes-notably on some wood-work of the seventeenth century in Oxford. I think that the encarpa refer to the palmettes in the angles between the volutes proper and the central portion of the canalis, present in all but a handful of examples, of which the Erechtheum is the most famous. They represent a flower with the fruit just developing inside it-indeed in fourth century and later palmettes, the core is often represented as an incipient seed-pod. Jebb, on Sophocles, OT 25 ("KAU~,lv YK&amp;cp-rro&amp; X0ov65"), says 'Sophocles' KCAUJ iyKcapwosis the shell or case which encloses immature fruit'; and on the palmettes of the capitals of Lysicrates' Monu- ment, as drawn by Stuart and Revett, the petals are just dropping off this well-formed seed-case. See PLATE 45c. I can now attempt to translate the passage. 'Below the foot of the shaft they put a base, to serve as a shoe. On the capital they placed volutes to left and right, hanging over like set curls of hair; and they adorned the fronts of their capitals with moulded echini and palmettes in place of carefully disposed locks of hair. Down the whole shaft they drew vertical flutes like the folds in long gowns, recalling the dress of a married lady.' Vitruvius then summarizes the discovery of the two sorts of column. 'So they borrowed their invention of columns from two different models. One sort of column resembled a man, naked and unadorned; the other the subtlety, the proportions and the ornamental dress of a woman.' 7 For the capitals of Teos, see Antiquities of lonia iv (I88I) pl. 25. The example I show on PLATE 45b I photographed in 1960.</page><page sequence="7">VITRUVIAN STUDIES 185 All this seems to me to make good sense, and to be perfectly applicable to conditions early in the sixth century. Already at that time statues of men were naked, of women draped. Further- more, the columnar statues of women, best known from the famous Hera of Cheramyes,s which might be considered, for all the striae on her dress, too late to have influenced the oldest Ionic column-shafts, are now known to go back to an interesting piece, transitional from the much older Kore of Auxerre. It was found near Athens in September 1967 and is noticed in Archaeo- logical Reports for 1967-8, 6. It appears to lack the striae, but in many ways anticipates the shape and proportions of Hera; and surely it must date from at least 600 B.c. It would have been hard to predict a find such as this. IV. THE PROPORTIONS OF DORIC AND IONIC COLUMNS IN VITRUVIUS I propose to consider three passages at the beginning of Book Iv-in Iv. i. 6, Iv. i. 7, and Iv. i. 8. 'Dimensi sunt virilis pedis vestigium et id retulerunt in altitudinem. Cum invenissent pedem sextam partem esse altitudinis in homine, idem in columnam transtulerunt et qua crassitudine fecerunt basim scapi, tantas sex cum capitulo in altitudinem extulerunt. Ita dorica columna virilis corporis proportionem et firmitatem et venustatem in aedificiis praestare coepit' (iv. i. 6). Morgan translates, substantially agreeing with Granger, 'They measured the imprint of a man's foot and compared this with his height. On finding that, in a man, the foot was one sixth of the height, they applied the same principle to the column and reared the shaft, including the capital, to a height six times its thickness at its base. Thus the Doric column, as used in buildings, began to exhibit the proportions, strength and beauty of the body of a man.' 'Item postea Dianae constituere aedem quaerentes novi generis specie, isdem vestigiis ad muliebrem transtulerunt gracilitatem, et fecerunt primum columnae crassitudinem altitudinis octava parte, ut haberet speciem excelsiorem' (Iv. i. 7). 'Just so afterwards, when they desired to construct a temple to Diana in a new style of beauty, they translated these footprints into terms characteristic of the slenderness of women, and thus first made a column the thickness of which was only one eighth of its height, so that it might have a taller look' (Morgan: Granger understands 'isdem . . . gracilitatem' as 'they changed it to a feminine slenderness with the same measurement by feet', and I should render it 'Using the same bearing-surfaces at the feet of the columns, they translated it to a feminine slenderness'-see above, p. 182). 'Subtilitateque iudiciorum progressi et gracilioribus modulis delectati septem crassitudinis diametros in altitudinem columnae doricae, ionicae novem constituerunt.' 'Advancing in the subtlety of their judgments and preferring slighter modules, they fixed seven measures of the diameter for the height of the Doric column, nine for the Ionic' (Granger: Morgan is a little freer). The meaning of all this is clear, and generally agreed. But does it correspond to the facts? I shall try to show that it is less mistaken than many scholars assume. We know today that Vitruvius' proportions for the first Doric columns are substantially correct-6:I. In the first Athena Pronaia at Delphi they were even a little slimmer (Robertson, GRA 65). In the 'Monopteros' there La Coste-Messeliere restores them as exactly 6:1 (Au Musde de Delphes (Paris, 1936) 43, 51). This is also the proportion of the columns on Thetis' Doric pavilion on the Frangois Vase. The stouter columns of the later sixth century are now 8 See, e.g., J. Charbonneaux, Sculpture grecque archaique (Paris, 1938) 27 and pl. 28: 'Cette figure, d'une dignite' heroique... cette transposition du corps f6minin, pose sur la base ronde comme une colonne', etc.</page><page sequence="8">186 HUGH PLOMMER seen to be a passing fashion, no true guide to the proportions of the first Doric. In the oldest known Doric Temple of Asia Minor, at Assos, the proportions are still over 5:1, close to those of the Parthenon, a good century later.9 Altogether, modern archaeological knowledge seems to vindicate Vitruvius on the first Doric proportions. On Ionic, however, he must be wildly wrong if we are to believe the latest student of its first Greek examples, Dr. G. Gruben, who devoted a hundred pages to the recovery of the Archaic Temple of Didyma in JdI 1963, and seemed to draw confirmation for his chief argument, that its columns were exceedingly tall and slim, from a short appendix in which G. Kaster restores the archaic Oikos of the Naxians on Delos with an inner row of Ionic columns at least I31, lower diameters in height. Now stone Ionic columns like flagpoles, with tiny capitals less than half a lower diameter high (Gruben, op. cit. 179), look at first sight not only un-Vitruvian but very ugly. Also, granted that the Oikos was a fairly small building, they still seem very flimsy supports for the pitched roof which we know, from its primitive marble antefixes (BCH 1921, 234), to have existed, and which I have just suggested in my two summary sections of the Oikos (FIG. 3) the left-hand taken from Kaster, the right-hand my own. The obvious remedy, which would strengthen the colon- nade longitudinally and give it some measured proportions, is to insert an intermediate archi- trave and make two tiers of columns (FIG. 4). If these now seem a little stumpy, because I have observed Kaster's total height (Gruben, 179), I would remind my readers that Kaster took it as an average, from rather battered data, and that one could perhaps add half a lower diameter to it (Gruben, 155); also that these rather widely spaced columns, in their two tiers, might well depart from the normal proportions of an external colonnade.o. But Gruben would restore very slim external colonnades for the Didymaion. In fact, he gives its columns a height ofjust under twelve lower diameters (ibid. 154, fig. 38). How does he achieve this? He has, of course, various column-fragments of various diameters, and has added to their number by interpreting the famous carvings of women in high relief as portions of the bottom drum of a shaft ('Saiulenreliefs'-pp. o6-12 and figs. 8-I3). For on the fragment in Berlin he has detected a concave field and traces of an arris. But otherwise he has only the evidence of alignments from a few supposed foundation-walls under and near the later Naiskos in the centre of the Hellenistic cella (p. 84, fig. I), and the supposition that the circular 'altar' (Wiegand, Didyma, Zeichnung 619 and 634), so badly off the axis of the present temple, was on the axis of its immediate predecessor. See his fourth and fifth figures, on pp. 96-7. He thus creates a build- ing about three-quarters the size of its successor, and gives it a plan of roughly Samian type, dipteral, with no opisthodomos and a square pronaos with two rows, each of four columns, running from front to back. The type of building is plausible, even if its supposed size seems arbitrary and even if the 9 Bacon and Clarke, Assos 145. Akerstr6m and Dinsmoor both date this temple about 540o. But I sometimes wonder if this is not rather too late. The terracotta 'antefix' (Assos 16I--really perhaps, a ridge-tile, for its lower face does not seem to be preserved and it sits rather unhappily as an antefix, as Assos 153 shows) is evidently much older than its direct descendant, the ridge-tile of the second Temple of Aphaia (Furtwaengler, Aegina pl. 48); how much older it is difficult to say. But in addition the capitals are spreading, like those of the earlier sixth century, and the mutules over the metopes, in a highly archaic fashion, are narrower than those over the triglyphs, as shown in Assos 153 and stated on p. 167-seven-eighths of their width on the fronts and only three-fifths on the sides of the temple. (Dinsmoor is quite wrong to suppose on p. 88 of AAG that they are all equal.) Moreover, the hawksbeak on the corona (Assos 155) sweeps backward considerably at the top. The krepis, too, has only two steps, which may be due to Ionic influence, but could also be a sign of early work, like the low krepis of the D6rp- feld Foundation's outer peristyle at Athens (see my article in JHS 1960, 13'). For all these reasons, I should not myself want to put Assos after 550. In some ways it resembles the Temple of Artemis at Corcyra. The Doric Order was perhaps first given its name in Ionia; so that even in Iv. i. 5 Vitruvius would not be wildly wrong. 1o In Vitruvius, of course, the more widely one spaces the columns, the stouter one has to make them (iiim. iii. io).</page><page sequence="9">0 10 20 30 40 50 FEET Feet o 2 1 3 4 5 FIGS. 3 and 4.

But there is one recalcitrant feature, the size of the columns in the pronaos (see FIG. 5a) .II They are much smaller than those of the peristyle. Gruben's fig. I o, facing p. I o8, restores the shaft with the reliefs of women to give a diameter of only 104 m. (I note that fig. 39, which puts these women on an external column, I 3 m. in diameter, is in fact wrong.)'z A 'great number' of fragments of column-shaft so far recovered (the phrase is Wiegand's) give, on calculation, a diameter of I13 m. These are described as 'Frgt. 12' in Gruben, 112, and assigned to the columns down the flanks of the temple. But there are others, his 'Frgt. 13', which he places above the women and assigns to the pronaos, though they are apparently of the wrong material (poros, not marble), and though, not having seen the fragments, he has assumed that Didyma Zeichnung 6oo is erroneous. Moreover, a pronaos with columns so much thinner than those of the peristyle (three-quarters their diameter, to be exact) seems unparalleled in Ionic temples of this type. Either the columns of the pronaos have the normal size, as at Priene or the Smintheum, or they are slightly reduced from the outer columns-about seven-eighths of their diameter, as at Teos (FIG. 5b),I3 a smaller reduction than that recommended by Vitruvius Iv. iv. 2 in a somewhat corrupt passage. He seems to advocate that a wide pronaos should have not only two columns at the front, between its antae, but also two others, aligned with them, in its interior. I think he means both sets of columns to have lower diameters four-fifths of those on the front of the temple. But possibly only the pair wholly inside the pronaos are to be made so small. All will depend upon what he means by 'et hae' and 'in fronte' in s 2 ('et hae altitudinem habeant aeque quam quae sunt in fronte, crassitudines autem earum extenuentur', etc.). In the last of the large Heraea at Samos, presumably laid out near the end of the sixth century, all the columns of the pronaos, both of its fagade and its interior, are drawn by O. Reuther on his large plan (Heratempel von Samos (Berlin, 1957) ZI) as slightly smaller than those of both the outer and inner pteron-say, about six-sevenths of their diameter. My partial plan, FIG. 5C, is a simplification of Reuther's, and tries to indicate those columns of which something substantial remains. Must the reliefs of women come from a column? In highly archaic art, c. 6o00 B.c., women often stood around the pedestals of perirrhanteria (F. Matz, GGK i, fig, 28; O. Broneer in ADelt. I960, pl. 65a: and see still the note in Payne and Young, AMS 12). One could envisage an object of the same general kind at Didyma, different in design because nearly a century later in date. Altogether, it cannot be claimed that Gruben has settled the heights or even the various possible diameters of the columns in his archaic Didymaion. As is well known, those columns of Ionic buildings that are actually preserved in European Greece observed the Vitruvian proportions of 8:1 until well down in the fifth century. So, for instance, those of the Athenian Stoa at Delphi (P. Amandry, Portique des Athgniens (Paris, 1953) pl. 27), the Temple on the Ilissus and its near contemporary (as I believe) the Temple of Athena Nike.'4 However, Amandry has lately made it certain (op. cit. I I and pl. 14) that the oldest of all, the Naxian Column at Delphi, had a height of 9": I, if one counts the cylinder at its foot as a base. Does not this refute Vitruvius? I cannot think so; for he would not have considered it a 1I From Graben Abb. I.

It has to support no entablature or roof, merely a sphinx. So surely it could be thinner than the columns of a peristyle. On the whole, our knowledge of early Ionic proportions con- firms the views of Vitruvius. As I have already remarked (p. 182 above), I must postpone my defence of Vitruvius' anthro- pomorphic theory of the Orders, which most modern scholars dismiss out of hand as quite absurd. But before concluding I should like at least to protest against their careless exposition of it. Typical treatment is accorded it by Professor Peter Collins, who writes as follows on p. 47 of his Changing Ideals in Modern Architecture (Faber, 1965): 'According to Burke, beauty resulted from such qualities as smallness, smoothness and delicacy. He therefore rejected the Vitruvian notion that architectural beauty was related to the proportions of the human body (i.e. that the Doric Order was deliberately based on a man, the Corinthian Order on a maiden, and the Ionic Order on a stout lady whose girth was the average between the two); and although the reasons he gave for rejecting such an obviously irrational tradition were surprisingly obtuse, this did not lessen the revolutionary character of his attack.' He rounds off this section by introducing Sir William Chambers, who, he says, continued Burke's attack on Vitruvius by insisting on the importance in art of the association of ideas. We may well wonder that anyone could ever have thought the girth of a 'stout lady' inter- mediate between that of a grown man and a maiden. Even the ancients were not such fools as that. Moreover, Collins has shown himself altogether too hasty. First of all, he is patently unfair to Burke, who does not even mention Vitruvius by name, let alone the 'stout lady'. Are the proportions, asks Burke, of seven, eight, or even ten heads to the total length 'exactly the same in all handsome men? Or are they at all the proportions found in beautiful women?' He is convinced that 'the patrons of proportion' transferred their artificial 'idea' to nature, rather than borrowing from nature the proportions they used in art-reasoning which, far from being 'obtuse', could surely act as a leitmotif in the more intelligent histories of Greek sculpture as it developed down to, say, Polyclitus.'~ Again, we could not gather from Collins that Vitruvius had other theories besides the anthro- pomorphic for the beauty of columns. But we have seen that in v. i. 3 he invoked the taper of conifers to justify the continuous taper of columns in the fronts of stoas. Moreover, Vitruvius, quite as much as Chambers, insists on the importance of associating ideas. In I. vii and Iv. v the dedications of temples are made to govern their siting, in Iv. viii the heights of their altars and in Iv. i. 6 and 7 their actual orders-Doric for Apollo, Ionic for Diana. Vitruvius thus associates ideas, and in a persuasive manner. Worst of all, of course, in Collins is the comparison of Ionic to a 'stout lady'. Vitruvius likens the Ionic capital to an elaborate coiffure, the numerous flutes on the Ionic shaft to the folds on a matron's robes-'truncoque toto strias uti stolarum rugas matronali more demiserunt'. Ionian matrons were not stout, to judge from the Hera of Cheramyes, who should be the 'matrona' par excellence.16 But she must await a later discussion.

But that she must be Hera is maintained by Lullies and Hirmer (Greek Sculpture (London, 1957) 4I), and made likely by the inscription down her robe.</page><page sequence="13">B.S.A. 65 PLATE 46 (a) (h (c) (d) (e) A LATE MINOAN SHRINE AT KNOSSOS Horns of Consecration from Knossos and sherds from the Stratigraphical Museun</page></plain_text>
