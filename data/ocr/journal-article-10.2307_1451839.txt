<plain_text><page sequence="1">BIBLICAL LITERATURE* Of all Hebrew philologists who indulge in the gentle art of emending the text of the Hebrew Scriptures Dr. Felix Perles is the most reasonable and conservative. There is method in his textual reconstruction and he has pinned down emendation to a fine science. No wonder his first series of Analekten (Munich 1895) has gained considerable renown and is being quoted far and wide. The same fate no doubt awaits also the second series,79 which like its predecessor contains many plausible and sometimes brilliant suggestions. The author modestly admits that much in his earlier work had to be abandoned, and this will hold true also of the present work. With the wheat there always goes some chaff. Nevertheless it is a creditable piece of work, for its good overbalance by far its bad points. The former are so abundant that everybody interested can find them. Some of the latter will be pointed out here cursorily. In some of the chapters, like that dealing with the wrong division of words, it is felt that criticism is overdrawn. There is also an exaggerated tendency to derive words from Accadian and Assyrian-Babylonian roots. Besides, the assumption of glosses goes a little too far: Thus on p. 98 Perles suggests that mD'-r Jer. 16. 16 is a gloss to D'!n, but the preceding D'!: D'm)1n requires o''vr D',nS, and, besides, the verb rDli shows that mD'n- is original; ibid. nimrv cannot be a gloss to nlsn, for, like D'rT= nlmn, it signifies "suits of clothes," Assyrian notwithstanding (as to Jud. 14. 19, where nliSnn stands alone, the text is doubtful, comp. Budde and Moore in their commentaries ad loc.); p. 99 Perles wants to make us believe that Lev. 20. 10 inyi nwN ne m, nivw is a gloss to the preceding wv nvw na 9m, nvw, to explain that by wr, nw a strange woman is meant, not his own wife; but how could one mistake here, when in the Bible 9qm is always used with reference to the wife of an- other? Moreover, the word 5on "complete" (p. 89) is not new, for it is found in the biblical lexica alongside of "wean" (comp., e. g. Gesenius- Buhl and Brown-Driver-Briggs sub verbo); '1w' (p. 33) does not mean hingestreckt, and as to nhrl (p. 34) it might have been nwDl. It should * Continued from Vol. XIX No. 4. 79 Analekten zur Textkritik des Alten Testaments. Neue Folge. Von FELIX PERLES. Leipzig: GUSTAV ENGEL, 1922.

It is a pity that the author omits sometimes discussion and substantiation and gives instead cross-references to periodicals in which some of these emenda- tions and explanations first appeared. Is not the book supposed to supersede the articles? Some mistakes or misprints have crept into the book, as, e. g., p. 50 where "Abirren auf IDrm in b" yields no sense and should probably be "auf inmrn in a;" ibid. Zech. 11. 13 should be 11. 3; p. 51 in the reference to Is. 46. 13 the first N' is omitted; p. 57 middle Prov. 29. 11 should be 29. 21; p. 101 the references to Zech. should read Mal. Dr. Eitan's book,80 a thesis for the Ph. D. degree at Columbia Uni- versity, is a real contribution to biblical lexicography, in spite of some faults to be stated hereafter. As pointed out by Prof. Gottheil in his introductory note, "Dr. Eitan has endeavored to explain some difficult passages in the text of the Old Testament upon a double basis: The first is the inherent probability of a root's meaning from its connection in the text; the second is the derivation of such a meaning from a comparison with similar roots in sister dialects." It is this endeavor to explain the difficulties in the biblical text through a derivation from the cognate languages, chiefly from Arabic, that makes the book very valuable. Others flippantly resort to emendations as the easiest solution, not so Dr. Eitan who rigidly adheres to the masoretic text and tries to explain it as it is. Herein lies the test of good and sound exegesis. Only when all possible means of such explanation are exhausted may a slight departure from the Hebrew text be ventured. This worthy criterion Dr. Eitan is guided by in all his researches into the masoretic text of the Scriptures, which have already yielded some good results and hold out a great promise for the future. As to unfavorable comment on this book, it has a minor fault in that it is partly a rechauffe of former articles in various Jewish and Semitic journals. But this is not so serious, and may easily be pardoned. The chief fault to be found with Dr. Eitan is the inclusion in his book of explanations advanced by Bible critics before him. In justice to the latter these ought to be pointed out here: p. 5 nrw "to be high" is really a conjecture of Eppenstein in REJ., LII, 196, who compares nrr, of Ibn Canab as quoted by Saadia Ibn Danan 80 A Contribution to Biblical Lexicography.

Both these verbs are etymologically identical, and all the theorizing about .LX-,. being a Hebrew loan-word picked up by the Bedouin invaders and not a direct development from .t hardly holds good. Thefact is, as pointed out so often recently, that there is no sharp line of demarcation in meaning between words of this kind, and the one may simply be a dialectic variant of the other (comp. Siegmund Fraenkel, "Zum sporadischen Lautwandel in den semitischen Sprachen," in Beitrdge zur Assyriologie, III, 60 ff.). With reference to in' "be perpetual, exist permanently" it should be remarked that already Perles (Analekten, p. 65 f.) and with him most modern commentators admit with regard to Prov. 12. 12 that we ought to read 1n'N (r. in') instead of n'.</page><page sequence="4">154 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW The etymology oD'W=r "draw the sword and attack" has been advanced by Ehrlich in his commentary on 1 Sam. 15. 2 and also on 1 Kings 20. 12. It should also be pointed out that Eitan overestimates the value of Ethiopic for the identification of Hebrew. Thus up, wp3, and mlpn;r, do not have to be derived from Ethiopic Batata, since Talmudic Aramaic possesses the root up "separate" which in the Pa'el signifies "make small" and in the Ithpa. "quarrel," comp. also Pilp. Dp-p "make small" (Levy, Lexicon, IV, 281, col. 1). Besides, also Arabic aj means "to cut in parts" (similarly j, ji and ,L), hence "make small." In Koh. 3. 18 Eitan reads ;3rI 1nomr orW, construing on as a noun and deriving it from Arabic rt[ "to run about madly," and renders "the stupidity of beasts is to them." But .o^, as may be seen from Arabic lexica (Biberstein-Kazimirsky, Lane, Dozy, etc., s. v.), primarily means "to be in love, to be maddened by amorous desire" and has no reference at all to "stupidity." It might be more advanta- geous to read oN (from Arabic f,o) = cares, worries: ODirI Doin: Hi 01 10n1: D:1 nll 'i "God has not created them but to show that they have the same worries as beasts." In Job 31. 23, where he very well reads t' n,r s i nnn ,' and renders "for the terror of God was mighty upon me, by reason of His majesty I could do nothing," a more forceful rendering would be "for the terror of God overwhelmed me, and before His majesty I was powerless," in agreement with the Septuagint and the Peshitta. Not quite convincing is his explanation iaoW -i, Job. 39. 25 = -n ilp1 ip (from Arabic , "noise, roar"). His notion that the Septuagint and Vulgate bear this'out is unfounded, since these versions simply use here a free translation, as is quite natural in an adverbial phrase. Very ingenious, though hardly correct, is his inter- pretation of Ob. 1. 6 lry (II lmtr) = l', = his hidden things, from Arabic '. The book is written in poor English style and, besides, contains many typographical errors, especially in Greek quotations. The second edition of Gressmann's creditable commentary8i differs from the first (1910) in some respects.

Then the notes on textual criticism have been eliminated from the body of the book and relegated to the back with a separate pagination. Also the Bileam lyrics, which were found after 1 Sam. ch. 15 in the first edition, have been removed to the story of Moses (vol. I, 2), while Isaiah ch. 15 and 16 have been eliminated altogether. On the other hand, the complete text of Hosea has been incorporated in the present edition, and a separate introduction has been written for the Book of Amos. The exposition, too, experienced many changes in all its departments: literary, folkloristic, religious, historical and geographical, with the result that the commentary has grown to voluminous proportions. As might be expected from a pupil of Gunkel, too much space is given to mythical and legendary theories while very little space is allotted to textual criticism. A considerable drawback in the latter is the quotation of the Hebrew text in translitera- tion instead of Hebrew letters. Schmidt's commentary on the Great Prophets82 appeared first in 1914, during the conflagration of the World War, when the author was serving in the army and had no leisure to turn out a finished product. Hence the introduction had to be written by Hermann Gunkei, and hasty work- manship left a number of lacunae to be taken care of in a later edition. The present edition, carefully worked out, lays claim to considerable augmentation and improvement and is a decided advance over its predecessor. Not only does it include more selections from the texts of the Great Prophets, but each selection is also better treated and more becomingly commented upon. The second edition of Haller's commentary on the post-exilic writings of the Hebrew Scriptures,83 like the other works of this series, contains many additions and corrections of an important nature.

The augmentation and improvement extend to almost every page and every paragraph. Kretzmann's commentary on the Bible84 is a Lutheran commentary and tries to establish the Lutheran doctrine from the Bible. As such it serves its purpose, though it does not advance biblical exegesis in the least. A commentary on the Hebrew Scriptures that focuses Jesus as the center of all divine revelation looks threadbare and worn in these modern days. Nor does its considerable bulk cover its hollowness. The arrangement is too monotonous and might have been more attractive. Only a few maps relieve this monotony. The introductions to each book are too summary and shallow. Procksch's bulky commentary on Genesis,8s which has proved to be of great help to the biblical student for more than a decennium, is now going through a second and third edition. While the fundamental structure remains the same, notably the division into supposed sources and the separate treatment of the three main sources (J, E, P), necessary changes have been introduced into almost every page. The most marked change is the transfer of the story of the eastern kings (ch. 14) and the second Dinah version (ch. 34*) to P. More consideration is given also to meter in poetical portions, and more attention is paid to the Septuagint version and its derivatives, probably due to the just strictures of Dahse and his confreres. Under no circumstances will Catholic scholars of the Bible approve of the documentary theory of Higher Criticism, and Devimeux86 counters this radical theory by a hypothesis that the Book of Genesis is a poetical work from beginning to end, consisting of a series of apparently inde- 84 Popular Commentary of the Bible.

In this sense the book, rather than a collection of fragments or sources, appears a perfect whole and exhibits great unity from beginning to end. To prove his theory the author proceeds to render the first eleven chapters into French verse, as literal as possible. But as a matter of fact his verse, except in actually poetical parts, like 4.23f., sounds prosaic, devoid as it is of the principle of parallelism and the powerful swing of imagination. The controversy between the Fundamentalists and the Modernists, according to Dr. Fagnani,87 turns largely upon their opposing views of the first eleven chapters of Genesis: the former believe that they are inspired of God, while the latter consider them to be a collection of myths and primitive folklore, much of it borrowed from Babylonian or other sources. Dr. Fagnani's contribution to this discussion consists in a new translation of the first eleven chapters of Genesis, from a revised Hebrew text and with explanatory notes, with a view of showing their mythical and irrational character and their patent clash with the modern theory of evolution. The translation is literal and emphasizes the anthropomorphic and anthropopathic elements. The new edition of Steuernagel's commentary on Deuteronomy88 follows the same radical trend as its predecessor with its minute sub- division of sources. The only changes noticeable concern minor points of exegesis and lexicon. Owing to economy of space the preface is omitted and extensive disquisitions are curtailed. Unfortunately the book is marred by misprints in the Hebrew quotations, as, e. g., p. 71 end ,'L1mt for ',rot and p. 174 end lrtp for ,'trp. De Wette's Deuteronomistic theory, reenforced by Wellhausen, has been severely shaken of late years through the attacks and onslaughts of Wiener, Moller, Kennett, H6lscher, Horst, and a host of other scholars and critics, some of whom have advanced the composition of 87 The Beginnings of History According to the Jews.

Recently Theodor Oestreicher, in a book entitled Das Deuteronomische Grundgesetz, has endeavored to prove that the cardinal idea underlying the reform of Josiah was not centralization of worship, as claimed by the adherents of the documentary theory, but rather purity of worship, and that the same idea of purity and not centralization of worship underlies also the Book of Deuteronomy. This hypothesis leads him to the conclusion that Deuteronomy is very old and not a product of the seventh century, while the reform of Josiah was executed in the spirit of the ancient law of Deuteronomy. Staerk89 expounds and elaborates this view of Oestreicher, which he considers a death-blow to the source theory of Wellhausen, at the same time refuting H6lscher's claim that Deuteronomy was composed about 500. In its legal ordinances, he asserts, it does not differ much from the Book of Exodus. Budde9o offers a detailed study of the Song of Moses, which he believes to be post-exilic, since it is dependent upon Deutero-Isaiah and Ezekiel in thought and diction. In fact he claims that originally the exile must have been mentioned after verse 25, but this was eliminated when the song was put into the mouth of Moses. The author has no doubt that the Blessing of Moses is much older than the Song, and explains the incongruity of two such poems of the same nature and one near the other by the circumstance that there were two versions current of the Book of Deuteronomy, an earlier one with Moses' Blessing, which is probably the Elohistic counterpart of Jacob's Blessing in J, and a later one with the Song of Moses, and these two were combined at a later date into the present masoretic text, with both farewell poems retained. A similar phenomenon may be seen in the Book of Joshua, where Joshua bids farewell to the Israelites twice, in ch. 23 and again in ch. 24. There is nothing startling in the reconstruction of the song itself. Der Segen Mose'sg9 is a sequel to Das Lied Mose's and constitutes a reconstruction of the very difficult thirty-third chapter of Deuteronomy. 89 Das Problem des Deuteronomiums.

The latter, according to the author, originated in northern Palestine during the reign of Jeroboam II, while the psalm is Deuteronomistic in character. In his reconstruction the'author operates with meter and emendation, the latter derived largely from his predecessors. The reconstruction is not bad, though it is rather rash to claim to have recovered the original Hebrew text. A commentary on the Book of Joshua must concern itself chiefly with the geography and topography of Palestine, but Schulz's commentary92 is more exegetical than geographical and lays greater stress on diction than on names of localities and their identification. Still, leading archaeological authorities are quoted briefly, without discussion, in each case, and an effort is made to identify ancient places with modern Arab sites. The author's attitude to the text of Joshua is critical: though not an adherent of the modern hypothesis he believes in an original book of Joshua, written perhaps or dictated by Joshua himself, and minor additions of later scribes who probably annotated the original; but the book in its present form was produced a long time before David. More- over, the Hebrew text suffered from the vicissitudes of time, as may be seen from the Septuagint which exhibits a better text. In his transla- tion, therefore, the author departs sometimes from the masoretic text, indicating such passages by cursive type, while the later additions are put in brackets. These departures are not always justified, but at least they are not radical and in many cases are limited to transposition of passages and verses from one place to another. A brief introduction deals with the contents of the book and its place in the Canon, its textual condition, time of composition, contemporary history, etc. An air of good old orthodoxy breathes from Breuer's commentary on the Book of Judges,93 and not a waft of modern biblical criticism is admitted into its pages. The standpoint of the author is that of divine 92 Das Buch Josue iibersetzt und erklart von Dr. ALFONS SCHULZ.

Wonderful are the ways of God and wonderful are the ways of biblical heroes and heroines, but our defective human mind cannot comprehend them. Hence we should abstain from useless research into the historical and religious background of the Bible but try to understand the Hebrew text the way it is. And so Dr. Breuer gives us an old-fashioned exposition of the Book of Judges, interspersed here and there with Midrashic interpretations, which may be good for beginners but not for advanced students. Dietrich94 institutes an exhaustive study of the phrase nlr niltr in the Scriptures. First he endeavors to determine its exact meaning, etymologically, grammatically, and exegetically. After a survey of previous hypotheses he arrives at the conclusion that this phrase, apparently meaning "to restore (as formerly)," is composed of the transitive :lv, which had taken the place of a still used n:n, and the noun nl:rW, which, derived from =lt must have sounded originally shabuth, but later, through an interchange with the noun rip' "captiv- ity," was pronounced and interpreted wrongly, as if it meant "to restore the captivity." Then, guided by the eschatological researches of Gunkel and Gressmann, he endeavors to prove that this fixed formula is eschatological and bears reference to the hope of the national restoration of Israel in the future. It is very probable, says the author, that the background of the prophetic-national idea of n:uv :lw must be sought in very ancient foreign eschatology with its theory of the return of mythical processes of antiquity at the end of days. This is in accord with Gunkel's hypothesis that eschatology in Israel is older than prophecy, and altogether the book shows the impress of the ideas of Gunkel, who suggested the theme to the author. The subject is ably treated and well presented. An appendix contains a table of synonyms of the phrase discussed which are employed for the restoration of the people in the Old and New Testaments, in the Apocrypha, and also in rabbinic sources. Duhm's commentary on Isaiah,9s which has been enjoying a world- wide reputation among all scholars of a radical trend, was first published 94 nlmV 1i.

The repeated demand for this book, especially the exhaustion of the third edition during the abnormal years of the World War, attests fully its special worth and good parts. In literary analysis and logical reconstruction of the Hebrew text it still ranks among the foremost efforts of the end of the nineteenth century, though in archeo- logical penetration and sympathetic understanding of the original Hebrew and its peculiar mode of thought it falls below the desired standard. The present edition does not differ considerably from the third, and therefore does not require new comment. Dr. Jefferson's book on the cardinal ideas of Isaiah96 is in the form of lectures or sermons delivered to a Bible class. These lectures are headed "The Social Vision of Isaiah," "A Holy and Reasoning God," "Religion and Morality," "Sin and Retribution," "The Remnant," "The Messiah," "A Warless World," "The Day of the Lord." They are introduced by two lectures on "The Value of the Study of the Hebrew Prophets" and "Why It is Difficult to Read the Prophets." The book closes with an appendix containing questions on the first thirty-nine chapters of the Book of Isaiah for the use of Bible Classes. Sheppard's new translation of the first twelve chapters of Isaiah97 is quite literal and approaches the Hebrew text much more than any of the official English versions in existence. This faithfulness to the Hebrew original manifests itself not alone in verbal renderings but also in the sequence of words and phrases. Nevertheless, here and there the translator adopts a textual emendation (as, e. g., 3. 17 "their shame"), though he does not indicate his reasons for such procedure. It is hardly just that such a work should be issued without notes or remarks of any kind, leaving us in the dark as to the justification of renderings of some difficult passages. The question whether the Ebed Yahweh of Isaiah is an individual or collective designation has agitated critical minds for centuries, and advocates have not been lacking for one interpretation or the other. ben von W.

The epithets of the servant of Yahweh represent primarily the experiences of the -prophet in his struggle for righteousness and humanity, but at the same time they are cast in the frame of an ideal picture existing among the Israelites from time immemorial, the ideal picture of the innocently suffering, just and pious people which appears in the ritual plaintive psalms, the psalms in connection with sin offering. It will be seen that this view of an individual prophet follows closely that of Saadya, who is of opinion that Ebed Yahweh refers to Jeremiah; while in its religious- historical interpretation it verges on the eschatological theory of Gunkel and Gressmann, according to which a belief was current in ancient Israel, as in other Oriental countries, that a mysterious god, Tammuz- Adonis or Tammuz-Moses, suffered and died for man's sins and will one day be resurrected. The author elaborates his theory through an analysis of the respective biblical texts. As a preparation to a commentary on the Book of Isaiah K6hler99 presents a stylistic study of Deutero-Isaiah (ch. 40-55), in which the minutest peculiarities of Hebrew style are discussed in extenso and classified under different headings. The text on which he bases his conclusions is not the masoretic text, but a strictly logical and rhythmic text in harmony with the reconstructions of modern critics, particularly Duhm, on whom he leans heavily. Needless to say, not all his emenda- tions are justified. Thus the omission of the relative nrvn wherever found is probably due to an erroneous notion which favors the paratactic construction in Isaiah. It cannot be due to his metrical theory, since he seems to be reconciled to a non-uniform meter even within one section, and all kinds of metrical schemes recur in his reconstructed text. As to his conclusions with regard to the rhetorical style of Deutero- Isaiah, he finds all kinds of constructions and figures of speech and anything but strict uniformity and a measured scheme. Thus we find both syndetic and asyndetic constructions, and likewise both paratactic and hypotactic sentences, unconnected coordinative and connected subordinative clauses, of equal frequency. The author reaches the conclusion that syntactically the Hebrew of Deutero-Isaiah is in the 98 Der Knecht Jahwis von D. SIGMUND MOWINCKEL. Giessen: ALFRED TOPELMANN, 1921.

Very interesting is the somewhat lengthy discussion of the verbal material and figures of speech of Deutero-Isaiah. Altogether the book should prove of undoubted value to the biblical student. Unfortunately it teems with misprints, which ought to be corrected in a second edition. So many commentaries have been written in recent years on the Book of Isaiah, especially Deutero-Isaiah, that one wonders whether there is room and need for a new commentary. But Levy's commentaryT00 has something to recommend it: it emphasizes the much neglected Jewish side of exegesis. Its justification lies in the fact that, unlike modern commentaries, it makes use of the older rabbinic expositors, whom one often perceives to be quite modern and up-to-date (comp., for instance, Ibn Ezra's reference to Cyrus in 41.2), and even quotes early liturgical texts in support of some explanations. In brief, Levy's commentary, though not quite original, is conservative and sane, very few textual changes being introduced. The author is opposed to the radical critical school and he certainly makes his point when he declares in the preface "that on the question of transferring sections of the text from place to place that school went to unjustifiable extremes, and that such brilliant commentaries as those of Duhm suffer from failure to appreciate the fact that a prophet was also a poet in something besides the form in which he uttered his thoughts. He expressed himself under the influence of strong emotion, and his thought leapt from point to point without regard to cold logical sequence." Hence he steers clear of the radical theories and interpretations, though he mentions them in his argument. Besides the commentary there is a new English transla- tion from the Hebrew text, indicating by means of accents the rhythm of the original. The long introduction, occupying a little less than half of the entire book, deals not only with the ordinary introductory subjects (such as historical background, life and times, composition, etc.) but also largely with the influence of Deutero-Isaiah on Judaism, both ancient and modern. The book contains a moderate bibliography and concludes with a double index.

It leans heavily on Duhm, Marti, Cheyne and Sellin, whose theories and emendations it often adopts, but it has its own merit of clearness and lucidity. Above all it furnishes a beautiful and harmonious French rendering of the Hebrew text. Side by side with modern exposi- tors also the Church Fathers are quoted. Besides an introduction there is a conclusion summarising the results of the commentary. The author considers chapters 56-66 of Isaiah as "an ensemble of prophetical discourses, composed by several authors, for the most part juxtaposed without any marked connection, and which, with the exception perhaps of a short. and very obscure fragment (63, 1-6) and an appendix of an uncertain date (66, 18-24), reflect the troubled situation of Judaism at its very beginning, that is between the return from exile authorized by the edict of Cyrus (538) and the final foundation of the new community at the time of Ezra and Nehemiah (458-445)." Curiously enough, the eleven chapters are divided among six different authors, besides an editor who joined these parts into a whole. There is also a discussion of the literary and religious value of Trito-Isaiah, and, finally, of its practical application in the Church. A serious flaw is the use of trans- literation instead of Hebrew letters. Volz's commentary on the Book of Jeremiah0o2 does not differ much from the standard German commentaries on this biblical book. It must have been modelled after Duhm's commentary, for it resembles it in many points, chiefly in its application of the canons of textual criticism and the advanced methods of religious-historical exegesis. In the first place it operates largely with textual emendation, changing words and phrases at will to suit certain favorite theories and novel notions; in the second it takes account of the various archaeological discoveries for the sake of certain religious and historical deductions. The emendations are not always felicitous and sometimes they even betray a lack of knowledge of Hebrew idiom, as, e. g., 2. 16 irt lrrpl ilp' for jlpyn ipip, or 10. 20 ,yr, irma for "K, ',n. Consequently, the exposition does not always breathe conviction. Also the historical and chrono- logical deductions appear sometimes arbitrary, especially when certain passages and entire chapters are ruled out as non-Jeremianic and as later interpolations. This may be true with reference to words and passages which appear as doublets, but cannot be said of entire chapters 102 Der Prophet Jeremia fibersetzt und erklart von D. PAUL VOLZ.

Needless to say, Volz is an adherent of the modern metrical theory in biblical Hebrew, which goads him to introduce many changes in the Hebrew text for the sake of the meter. Volz divides the book into three sections: ch. 1-25, 26-36, 37-45, and the last chapter (52) closing the entire book; ch. 46-51, containing prophecies about the nations, are considered by him post-Jeremianic and later interpolations, hence he removes them to the end of the book. Another departure from the masoretic sequence is the placing of ch. 26 after 7. 15. But even in the Book of Jeremiah proper he finds many post-Jeremianic elements, which he very cleverly explains as a gradual accretion through contin- uous liturgical use, whereby modifying annotations and explanatory glosses were introduced by readers. This might explain the brevity of the Septuagint version, which contains one eighth less than the masoretic text. This problem has been dealt with by the author in extenso in a previous book entitled Studien zum Text des Jeremia (1920), so that here only the bare results are given. The German translation of the Hebrew text is exact and precise, the poetical parts being in rhyme. An introduc- tion deals with the life and activity of Jeremiah, and problems cognate thereto. Volz takes the standpoint that Jeremiah was not in opposition to Josiah's reform but that he preserved a passive and sceptical attitude with regard to its results. The book has many fine points, but it is encumbered with numerous misprints. The first edition of Professor Longacre's book on Jeremiaho?3 appeared in 1917. The present edition has been revised and enlarged to include a chapter on the teachings of Jeremiah, notes and questions at the end of each chapter, including topics for written treatment, and references to the commentary on Jeremiah in the Cambridge Bible series. The work as a whole is elementary and the bibliography at the end is meager. (The author thinks that "the literature of Jeremiah is not extensive"!). The little volume on Jeremiah the Prophet of HopeI04 restates to the general reader in a flowing and graceful style the oft repeated sad story of the prophet of Anathoth. The story is arranged in six chapters comprising six periods in the life of the prophet, and each chapter has at the end a table of reference, referring the particular event or prophecy 103 A Prophet of the Spirit.

At the end of the book the same references are given in their totality and in consecutive order. Herrmann's commentary on the Book of EzekielIos is an elaboration and amplification of his Ezechielstudien published in 1908. In spite of the modern tendency to ascribe the apparent flaws and incongruities in this difficult book to a multiplicity of documents or sources he insists that the entire book was composed by the prophet Ezekiel himself and explains its incongruities by the fact that the earlier prophecies had been retouched or reedited by Ezekiel when he was an old man. Hence the two different points of view, the primary Ezekiel being highly poetic and prophetic, while the secondary Ezekiel is legalistic and ritualistic. Herrmann separates these two elements in the book, indicating the secondary element by brackets or indentation. The translation aims to be exact rather than esthetic, and for this reason metrical claims are left without consideration. Difficult passages, like the sword prophecy 21.13 ff., are declared to be hopelessly corrupt and left untranslated. The commentary is quite extensive and is two-fold: a historical and critical exposition following the translation, and lexical and grammatical remarks in the form of footnotes. The author is careful to acknowledge his indebtedness to the textual studies of Cornill, Kraetzschmar, Rothstein and Ehrlich. The book is preceded by a brief introduction, including an extensive bibliography. Holscher's analysis of the Book of Ezekiel,xo6 like that of his pre- decessor Herrmann, is based largely on the textual studies of Cornill, Toy, Jahn, and Rothstein, and contains very little that is new, aside from the arrangement. His guiding principle seems to be to excise everything that is too difficult for comprehension and to declare it as hopelessly corrupt. Thus the difficult sword song is cut to pieces and only a few of its innocent phrases are retained. This certainly is a poor solution and one ought to beware of following it. As to the author's reconstruction, he claims to find an old and original Ezekiel, highly poetical and mostly corrupt, and later additions by one or more editors, prosaic and well preserved. He conceives the former as a consummate o05 Ezechiel iibersetzt und erklart von D. JOHANNES HERRMANN (Kommentar zum Alten Testament herausgegeben von Professor D. ERNST SELLIN. Band XI). Leipzig: A.

Chapters 40-48, which Mowinckel styles Deutero-Ezekiel, are ruled out as not belonging to the original Ezekiel. The reconstructed Hebrew text is improperly transliterated into German letters. The Book of Ezekiel emphasizes strongly the ritual requirements of the Jewish people, which is quite natural under the conditions of exile then prevailing and the threatened shock of assimilation; but this does not imply a lessening of purely ethical conceptions in that book as compared with the teachings of the pre-exilic prophets. Dr. Herzog?o7 institutes an inquiry into the ethical views of Ezekiel, by examining both the ritual and ethical prescriptions in detail. He admits that the former are too much accentuated, but he rightly points out that the true cult and ethics are not inimical to one another. Rather does the true cult possess a strong moral implication. In his view Ezekiel is a true prophet, not merely a reformer of the cult or learned scribe. This resuJts from the numerous ethical requirements in his book, which do not fall short of the exalted ethical precepts of the pre-exilic and moreover had a far reaching influence on the post-exilic prophets. The book is an attempt at a true, rather than a one-sided, appreciation of the great exilic prophet, an attempt to understand him within the frame of his own time, his peculiar problems and his personal nature. Sellin's commentary on the Minor Prophets?o8 is a fine and welcome contribution to biblical exegesis. Eschewing some of the radical theories and wild hypotheses of the younger school of German expositors it treads the middle path of sane and constructive criticism, for which Sellin is well known. The attitude is conservative and the tendency is to consider individual books as units of composition and in some cases to advance their age. Thus, according to him, the Book of Hosea is an authentic product, except a few later additions, and was composed during the first half of the eighth century. The Book of Joel, dating from 500, consists of two elements: the prophet Joel and an apocalyptic 107 Die ethischen Anschauungen des Propheten Ezechiel. Von Dr. P. PATRICIUS HERZOG, O.F.M.

The Book of Amos was written in its entirety by Amos, though a later redactor rearranged a few passages in an awkward sequence. Obadiah, on the other hand, despite its smallness, consists of four elements, only vv. 2-10 belonging to the original prophet Obadiah. The Book of Jonah, a unit except the psalm 2.2-10, was composed at the end of the fifth or during the fourth century. Micah contains some exilic or post- exilic, but by no means Maccabean elements, as maintained by some scholars. The alphabetic psalm in the first chapter of Nahum is genuine and an integral part of the book. With Duhm, Sellin places Habakkuk at the beginning of the Greek period, during the time of Alexander the Great. Zephaniah is genuine with the exception of a few glosses. Haggai was compiled immediately after 516, the year of the dedication of the second Temple. So was Zechariah ch. 1-8; while Zechariah ch. 9-14 came into being about 300. The date of Malachi is set at 470 and its unity defended. As to interpretation of the text, Sellin follows the rational method, which embraces emendations. In these he is guided by the exigencies of the meter, which to him is varied and not uniform. Of course, not all his emendations are sound or indispensable. Some of them, as the author tells us in his preface, are derived from a note-book of A. Klostermann, which the author utilized in his work. Altogether there is freshness and originality in every page of the book, as well as thorough treatment and authoritative statements. It is noteworthy that Sellin keeps his far-fetched theories concerning Moses and Shechem out of his commentary on Hosea. The book has many misprints, only a few of which are corrected on the last page. The third edition of Nowack's commentary on the Minor Prophets,1o9 like the second which appeared in 1903, has undergone considerable changes, particularly in the line of textual criticism. Many novel readings have been added, but even more have been discarded. Owing to a desire for economy of space summary statements are preferred to lengthy discussions about the merits and demerits of a reading. The only exceptions to this rule are Duhm, Marti, and Sellin, whose well- known commentaries on the Minor Prophets are always taken into consideration and their critical analyses approved or disapproved. og9 Die Kleinen Propheten iibersetzt und erklart von W.

Many misprints have crept into the text, both Hebrew and German. The Prdparation to various books of the Old Testament, begun by Dr. August Heiligstedt more than fifty years ago, is still a favorite with biblical students in Germany, as may be seen from the subsequent editions. Its value lies in the word-for-word rendering of the Hebrew text and the critical notes appended thereto. The present volume to some of the Minor Prophets"o s s in its second edition and does not differ much from the other volumes in this series. Dr. Crafer's little volume"' is admirable and commendable. It fulfills in every way the prescription of the general editor who states the aim of this series of commentaries to be "to explain the Revised Version for young students, and at the same time to present, in a simple form, the main results of the best scholarship of the day." Besides a concise exposition of Hosea's prophecies there is an ample introduction dealing with various phases of this book. Special features are a map of Asia Minor and a subject index. Hosea 1-3 dealing with the marriage of the prophet has experienced most diverse interpretations. It remained for AllwohnT2 to consider it from the standpoint of Freudian psychoanalysis and its theory of suppressed desires. According to him, Hosea's marriage with a lewd woman is a fact, not fiction, but this immoral union takes place in response to subconscious or suppressed sexual impulses and only finds its justification in serving as an example to the moral union of Yahweh and the people of Israel. In support of his theory the author points out the sexual allusions and erotic expressions found in the Book of Hosea of which this prophet seems to be very fond. Of course, he is careful to state that this immoral act on the part of Hosea does not reflect on his character, since he executed it at the express command of Yahweh.

It appears rather like so much hair-splitting and useless pettifogging. The author's attitude to the Hebrew text is conservative, confining himself to a minimum of emendations. The Hebrew quotations are not free from misprints. Texts for Students are always useful, but not when they follow an extreme and radical trend. The Book of Amos for Students113 is unneces- sarily overloaded with textual emendations, mostly after the Septuagint but also of the conjectural variety. Moreover, difficult and unusual words are omitted altogether, the omission being indicated by dots. Such a departure from the masoretic text is bound to produce confusion in the mind of the student, not to speak of irreverence to the Bible. The text is arranged in stichoi, and textual and grammatical notes accompany it. A vocabulary is found at the end of the book. There are numerous misprints in the Hebrew text. Praetorius' commentary on AmosI14 is strictly metrical. He admits that he had to abandon much of what he wrote heretofore about the Book of Amos, since he was misguided by the theory of uniform meter. Now he reverts to Sievers, according to whom seven-foot lines pre- dominate in the Bible. After a careful canvas he finds in the Book of Amos ninety seven-foot lines, seventy six-foot lines, thirty five-foot lines, twenty two-foot lines, and, in addition, a number of three-foot lines. Under this pliable system the author is not compelled to resort to excision as often as he was used to. Mr. Evans' little volume,"s originally written to serve the purpose of a lecture, is a popular exposition of the Book of Jonah and deals with the following phases of the Book: Authorship and Date, The Contents of the Book, The Literary Form of the Book, Jesus' References to Jonah, Jonah an Allegory, Some Lessons of the Book. Latterly the allegorical character of the Book of Jonah has been preached insistently and unintermittently. But this should not blind us to the fact that there is also another claim, the claim of the book's ,"3 The Book of Amos. Hebrew Text edited with critical and gramma- tical notes by THEODORE H.

No new arguments are advanced: The author operates with the old arguments of Jewish tradition and the Christian Church, winding up with the usual assertion that Jonah foreshadows one greater than Jonah, namely Jesus of Nazareth, and the statement that this book would not have been written but for the fact that its subject matter reaches to the centre and core of the Christian faith! Martin's little book on Jonah"? is a rechauffe of articles published in various periodicals. "The purpose of these studies is to offer to the general reader an interpretation of the Book of Jonah in harmony with the best scholarship of our time," so that there is hardly anything new in them, though the author claims to have made an independent study of the Hebrew text. The book is written from a Christian standpoint. Rabbi Posner's bookletx"8 is a running commentary on the Book of Micah, expository rather than philological. It is a purely Jewish commentary, following Jewish tradition and Jewish exegesis, and is intended for both class and private use. Curiously enough there is no introduction; but instead there are ten appendices dealing with various phases of the Book of Micah, such as the personality of Micah, the contemporary history and international situation, the chronology of the oracles, the artistic forms of expression, linguistic relations to Deuteronomy and Isaiah, quotations from Micah in the Talmud, etc. A separate insert contains the Hebrew text and a vocabulary of words not found in the Pentateuch.

Starting with a detailed exposition of the first five chapters of the Book of Micah, the author deduces that Micah expects a new ruler in Beth-Ophra, a place south of Shechem, formerly the seat of government of Israel, whose ancient ruler, a Judge of Israel, had been murdered treacherously by the people. He then examines chapters 6-9 of the Book of Judges, which since Budde and Moore have been divided into two sources, an Elohistic and Jahvistic. Like Sellin in his Sichem (1922) he follows this clue and finds two independent accounts concerning the fight over Midian, one dealing with the Manassite Gideon and the other with the Abiezerite Jerubbaal. The former tells of the campaign of Gideon and his faithful 300 in the east and their victory over Midian, as well as of the kingdom of Abimelech, the son of Gideon; the latter informs of Jerubbaal's attack on the Baal cult, his victory over Midian, and his ultimate murder by the adherents of Baal, the inhabitants of Beth-Millo, as a revenge for his iconoclasm. In the former the scene is in the north, in the latter in the south, namely Ophra. Finally he identifies this Jerubbaal with the expected ruler of Micah. An ingenious hypothesis, one is tempted to say. But this result is obtained at the cost of very radical emendations and unneces- sary changes in the masoretic text. Indeed, in his violence to the Hebrew text he out-Duhms Duhm. He practically rewrites the Micah text to suit his fancy, and in an inelegant Hebrew at that. In this he follows the radical scholars who are prone to conceive a notion and then endeavor to squeeze it out of the Scriptures by distorting the text. Thus of late we have been treated to many brilliant but unfounded theories about the Bible. It seems that the theory of Maccabean Psalms has had its day and is facing a severe setback now. Thus the outstanding point in Mowinckel's Psalmenstudienl20 is the claim that there is not even one psalm from the Maccabean period in the Psalter and that, on the contrary, most of Leipzig: A.

Following the lead of Gunkel he conceives all the psalms, whether collective or individual, in an ancient and original ritual-liturgical setting, and not in a spiritualised form, as assumed by most modern commentators; and as expressions of ritual acts and practices, not literary-historical documents, there is no reason why they cannot go back to hoary antiquity, when Israel was yet steeped in idolatry and pagan practices. This theory is elaborated very minutely and in overmuch detail in a series of six monographs, each one of which deals with a different phase of the same problem. In the first part of his voluminous work Mowinckel has a long disquisition on the term J]i, in which he endeavors to prove that its real meaning is "magic" (literally "wicked force," derived from ]iS "force") and that the frequent phrase ll ,y"s refers therefore to "magicians and sorcerers," while the terms o'ry, o'm, and o'rr refer to "demons." Accordingly, the individual plaintive psalms are really fervent appeals of the worshippers against baneful magic and magicians, and like the Babylonian psalms formed part of the ritual and liturgical practices performed in the Temple. This hypothesis, admittedly formed after a study of the Babylonian hymns which centre in magic, is an obsession with the author, who extends it to cover also the so-called thanksgiving psalms, wherein the enemies complained of are said to be no other than the magicians. The subject of the second part is the psalms dealing with the throne ascension of Yahweh, to which Mowinckel counts also the group of 15 psalms with the superscription shir ha-ma'aloth. Accord- ing to him, these psalms, which he conceives as ritual-liturgical and not as historical or eschatological, were chanted during the feast of the throne ascension, better known as the "Day of Yahweh," which was celebrated by a great procession personifying the royal entrance of the victorious god and at which probably Yahweh himself was carried up to the Temple in his ark. This feast of the throne ascension was part of a seven day feast which later developed into the triple feast of New Year, Day of Atonement and Tabernacles, and was known also as the feast of harvest; only during the Babylonian period, under the influence of the Babylonian calendar, this feast was shifted to the feast of Passover. This feast, the author thinks, is undoubtedly pre-exilic, as may be proved from 2 Sam. 6 and 1 Kings 8: Mowinckel believes it originated during the time of David. Consequently, the psalms written for this feast are likewise pre-exilic, in spite of Wellhausen, Smend, Buhl, Duhm, and others. Mowinckel is emphatic in his assertion that the throne ascension in the Psalms is not eschatological, as maintained by others, though he</page><page sequence="24">174 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW admits that it formed a basis for eschatology, for the essential features of the one are the same as those of the other: Day of Yahweh, destruction of the world, misery and salvation, day of judgment, the remnant, the new creation, the new covenant, God's universal kingdom, the Messiah, etc. But to Mowinckel eschatology too had its origin in pre-exilic times, and with Sellin he believes that it was native to the Israelites. The third part deals with prophetic psalms, i. e. psalms which have a prophetic form (like 60, 75, 82, and 110, in which God is quoted as speaking), and of these Mowinckel maintains that they are not mere poetical fictions, as is often assumed, but real ritual hymns based on ritual reality. It is well known that each cult consists of two elements: the sacrificial or human (offerings and prayers) and the sacramental or divine (answers to the prayers). Since originally priest and prophet were combined (as in the case of Moses and Samuel) it was natural for the priest to communicate the divine answer to the supplicant, hence these prophetic hymns. The author groups the individual prophetic psalms as follows: (1) Prophecies for the great yearly feast: 132, 89, 81, 95, 50, 82, 75, 87, 85, 14, 12; (2) Prophetic oracles at casual community services: 60, 108, 20, 21; (3) Royal oracles: 2, 110, 72, 45; 4) oracles in private ritual: 91, 12, 62. The fourth part is devoted to the technical terms in the superscriptions of the psalms, which presumably refer to some unknown musical instruments. Mowinckel's remarks about these terms are far from convincing and hardly add anything to the elucidation of this difficult and obscure subject of the Psalter. The fifth part discusses the psalms of benediction and the psalms of malediction, which, according to Mowinckel, were likewise used in the ritual, as an accompaniment to the festive procession to the Temple. The sixth and last part deals with the date and composition of the Psalms. Mowinckel puts no trust in the historical data contained in the superscriptions, which he considers as later additions. Nevertheless he places the bulk of the psalms in pre-exilic times: some of them are Davidic and some post-Davidic, though none were composed by David himself. He takes issue with Gunkel's view that the authors of the psalms were private individuals, the poor and afflicted themselves, who complained to God about their mishaps: according to him the psalms, with the possible exception of the individual thanksgiving hymns, originated in the circle of the Temple personnel, not of the higher order, the priests, but of the lower order, the singers, the Levites, whose function it was to compose such hymns for festive occasions. It will be seen that Mowinckel labors under a load of preconceived Babylonian notions and ideas.</page><page sequence="25">BIBLICAL LITERATURE-REIDER 175 He admits having started with Zimmern's Babylonische Busspsalmen, which exerted a potent influence on him, and in his glowing imagination he fancied to see in the Hebrew Psalter an exact replica of the Babylo- nian penitential psalms. Thus, in explaining the Psalter, he operates with Babylonian tools: the creation myth, the dragon myth, the fight of the gods, the struggle of the nations, and the myth of judgment. It is true that he advances the age of the Psalter considerably, but, as is the case with all the Pan-Babylonians, this is done at the expense of imitation of a Babylonian archetype. His arguments are not convincing, and some of his emendations are impossible. It might be stated paren- thetically that some of his thoughts have been expressed already by Gunkel, Winckler, and Gressmann, especially by Ad. Lods, Ed. Meyer, and Max Weber. Nor is his idea about the Psalms as liturgies altogether new. The work is too much spun out and contains many repetitions. There are a number of misprints both in the German text and the Hebrew quotations. LohrI2I discusses the problem of mixed psalms, i. e. psalms which through their content belong to two or three literary species at the same time. Of such eclectic psalms Gunkel says that they evince an undeveloped individualism and faulty composition. L6hr, on the contrary, believes that their individualism is well developed and their form is in agreement with lyric creations of their period. The variety of the material is sometimes only apparent, in not a few cases it is due to compilation pure and simple. But on the whole these psalms are well planned and thoughtfully executed, and they pursue a definite purpose. To prove this point Lohr analyses a number of such psalms (78, 105, 106; 42, 43, 46, 49, 80, 107, 50, 22, 73) textually and structurally and endeavors to show their essential unity of composition and purpose. Duhm's brilliant and highly ingenious commentary on the Book of PsalmsI22 is now in its second edition. The theory of the Maccabean origin of the entire Psalter is maintained as heretofore and elaborated more conclusively in his trenchant style. Many changes in arrangement and diction have been introduced, not the least being the separation of 121 Psalmenstudien. Von D. Dr. MAX L6HR (Beitrdge zur Wissenschaft vom Alten Testament. Neue Folge.

The combined third and fourth edition of Kittel's commentary on the Book of Psalms123 does not differ much in size from its predecessor. Still the present edition takes cognizance of the literature on the subject that has accrued since 1914 and has a bearing on the translation and exposition of the Hebrew text. Psalms 1-39 appear in a completely new translation, while the other psalms have been corrected and improved metrically. Marginal numbers designate the metrical scheme of each verse. These and other slight improvements, coupled with the conserva- tive attitude of the author with regard to the age of the Psalms, promise as great a success to the new as the previous editions. Dr. Leimbach's translation of and commentary on the Psalms,124 written from the Catholic standpoint for the people at large, has now reached its fourth edition. Nothing new has been added to the book in the present edition, not even a much needed index. The burden of Peters' book,125 like that of Mowinckel's, is that the Psalter constitutes primarily a collection of liturgical hymns for the sacrificial ritual and as such goes back to hoary antiquity. The author believes that Hebrew psalmody, like Babylonian hymnody, was very ancient in origin, probably going back to pre-Israelitic and Canaanite times, and that it is ascribed to David because he organized and sys- tematized it and caused the psalms to be written down. As in the historical-legal documents there are Yahwistic, Elohistic and Deuterono- mistic elements so also in the Psalter there is an early Judean collection of liturgies marked by the use of the divine name Yahweh, an early Elohistic collection from Israelite shrines marked by the divine name Elohim, and a collection corresponding in a way in its origin and 23 Die Psalmen iibersetzt und erklirt von D.

All these collections were combined in pre-exilic days into one Book of Psalms for use in the Temple at Jerusalem, and consisted of the first three books of our present Psalter (1-89). The two latter books (90-150) were collected and added later in post-exilic times. However, early in the third century B.C.E. the five books of Psalms were already in existence in their present form. Consequently, there is not a Maccabean psalm in the Psalter, for the canon of the Psalter was complete before that period. Peters elaborates this point in a lengthy introduction covering almost a quarter of the book. He then offers a new translation of the Psalms, placed side by side with the King James version, together with a brief commentary. This translation is in verse and is quite vigorous and effective. Here and there are noticeable emendations borrowed from German expositors, as, for instance, 2. 11-12 "With trembling kiss His feet," implying ipr rnrmyin 1 nri and explain- ing ni as a dittograph. The commentary, though expository, is deficient in. philological explanations and does not elucidate sufficiently proposed emendations. The explanation of the technical terms in the super- scriptions of the Psalms is old and does not contribute in any way to the solution of this difficult problem. The author follows a peculiar method of transliteration: Yahaweh, lelammedh, etc.; 'ugal (p. 46 f.) is probably a misprint for 'ugab. The aim of Prof. Smith's little book on the religion of the Psalmsz26 is "to bring out the significance of the Psalms as indicative of the religious and moral standards of later Judaism." To him the Psalter is the hymn book of the second temple and contains very little that goes back to pre-exilic times, not to mention the time of David: there is no reason why David should not have composed psalms, but if so they must have been in the polytheistic spirit of his day, and if retained in our Psalter must have been greatly modified to suit the spirit of strict monotheism. The author discusses also immortality and the idea of God in the Psalms, without, however, adding anything new on these subjects. The book is in the form of lectures and is intended for the general reader. A bibliography and indexes are appended.

It is based upon the masoretic Hebrew text, corrected and emended sometimes by conjecture and sometimes by a comparison with the ancient versions; but these corrections and emendations, borrowed mostly from well recognized authorities, such as Bertholet, Buhl, Duhm, Marti and Kittel, are not at all extreme. It is precise and accurate, neither too literal nor paraphrastic, and is couched in measured lines. In an ap- pendix the author discusses the date, the poetry, and the religion of the Psalter. As stated above, he considers the Psalter primarily as the hymnbook of the second temple. He believes in the Maccabean origin of some psalms (notably 44, 74, 79, and 83) and is of opinion that the Psalter was not completed until the Maccabean period or after. But this does not preclude the possibility of Davidic psalms: it is more than likely that David composed some psalms, but with the refinement of the Jewish religion and the development of its ethical concepts these were discontinued as out of date or revised to suit the newer spirit. As to the titles of the psalms, they are fictitious and should not be trusted. In fact, the author omits them from his discussion altogether. It should be noted that textual notes are appended in order to explain some of the departures from the masoretic text. Cooke's metrical version of the Psalms,"28 based upon the familiar English versions and, in addition, upon the well-known commentaries of Perowne, Driver, King, Kirkpatrick, and McFadyen, is a new and complete paraphrase of the Psalms in rhymed metre. Its value is chiefly literary and artistic, not expository and exegetical. In many cases it is difficult to recognize the original Hebrew behind the smoothly flowing quatrains. Yet the general sense is well preserved, and the volume has a raison d'etre as a proper means to memorize the noble ideas and lofty thoughts of the great hymnbook of mankind. Every now and then a new sensation is sprung in the field of biblical criticism, which causes a stir for a while and is raised to the superlative degree of "epoch making," until ripe reflection and mature deliberation lay it to rest. Such a sensation was sprung by Prof. Franz Wutz in his work Die Transkriptionen von der Septuaginta bis zu Hieronymus 128 Israel's Songs and Meditations. New Metrical Paraphrase of the Psalms. W. J. COOKE. Preston: Printed by R. SEED &amp; SONS, 1924. Pp. 210.</page><page sequence="29">BIBLICAL LITERATURE-REIDER 179 (Leipzig 1925), in which he advanced the startling hypothesis that the oldest translators of the Sacred Scriptures did not produce their versions from a Hebrew consonantal text, but rather from a Hebrew text trans- cribed in Greek letters, hence the numerous deficiencies and discrepancies between the original and the versions (for a very able criticism of this view comp. Prof. Max L. Margolis in this Review, XVI, 117-125). The present commentary on the Book of Psalms,129 which is strictly textual and not expository, is based on this doubtful hypothesis, and may be said to stand or fall with it. In this commentary he goes a little further, for he assumes that not only the Greek translators had a transcribed Hebrew text before them, but also that the Masoretes, fixing the Hebrew text for future generations, made use of such a transcribed text together with ancient Hebrew manuscripts. This shows to what lengths one may be led in one's attempt to bolster up an inauspiciously conceived theory. That Wutz is on the wrong track may be seen from some of his emenda- tions which are paraded repeatedly as ingenious and remarkable inven- tions but which on closer inspection prove to be baseless and impossible. Wutz, who emphasizes his opposition to conjectural emendation of the masoretic text, advocates methodical and systematic emendation based on the laws of ancient Hebrew paleography and the most ancient versions, the Septuagint and the Peshitta. But, after all, the test of an emendation ought to be its superiority over the emended text in Hebrew diction and style generally. Singular and unique words, so-called hapax legomena, are admissible, but they should at least fit into the general frame of Hebrew idiom. This is not the case in Wutz's commentary on Psalms, as may be seen from the following examples: 2. 12 he reads :.1 ti3 = nehmt Gesittung an, a conglomerate of Arabic and Syriac, not realizing that the masoretic text may have the same meaning: embrace or get hold of purity, comp. 78. 9 nvp 'oin 'pvr and its parallel in Jer. 46. 6 ntrp 'nlT 1sh (pri "to kiss" must have had an original meaning "to embrace, to grasp, to seize"); 8. 2 he reads ;,IIn I with the help of Arabic L-' "be prominent," which is hardly better than nnr niv of the Syriac version and does not ease the awkward construction with n''"; 29. 2 in what way is l'lrp nnina "in his holy chamber" better than masoretic rinp rnnn,a? 37. 20 D,np np,:, strangely enough, is read tI,rnnt (from Syr. anir) "strut, swagger;" 49. 15 he reads iD?'?. 5rimv (,n)5, riim, the last word being rendered by 129 Die Psalmen textkritisch untersucht.

What is one to think of such Hebrew constructions? Here is another specimen fondly quoted by Wutz as proof of the efficacy of his system of reconstruction: Prov. 17. 12 Onlq ~'D: ' . ' ist, =B'fc , = es befdllt die Sorge den verstdndigen Mann; das Sinnen des Toren liegt in seiner Narrheit; but who with a real insight into Hebrew idiom would approve of such a monstrosity? From these instances it is quite evident that for the most part the author relies on dictionaries and lexica rather than intuitive knowledge and introspective speculation. Wutz claims to reconstruct the Hebrew text of the third pre-Christian century and flatters himself that through his system of reconstruction the original Hebrew text of the Bible may sometime be recovered. However, if the text of the original Hebrew Scriptures did look different from that of the Masoretic Bible, and this is more than doubtful, it certainly did not look the way Wutz endeavors to make it look: a conglomerate of Arabic and Syriac vocables with no fixed rules of syntax. There is one other criticism to be made about Wutz's book: it is unnecessarily voluminous, for the same emendations are discussed three times, in the introduction, in the text, and finally in the index. Why all this repetition? So much for Wutz's efforts at reconstruction. As to exposition, only a very brief outline at the head of each psalm serves to indicate its content and historical background in general terms. Wutz believes in the Davidic authorship of most psalms bearing the name David at their head: the other psalms are later, but none of them go as far down as the Maccabean period, since the trans- cription from Hebrew into Greek, according to him, was already in existence at that time. It should also be mentioned that Wutz makes use of the Mercati fragments containing transliterations from Hebrew into Greek from the second column of Origen's Hexapla, but he does not attach much importance to them, for, according to him, they already represent a later Hebrew text than that of the transliterated text of the Septuagint: the latter seems to differ considerably from the second column of the Hexapla. Altogether, to Wutz the Vatican text of the Septuagint (B), which presumably constitutes the nearest approach to the original Septuagint that we have, is superior to any existing text, be it the masoretic Hebrew, Syriac or Aramaic. Hence, I think unjustly, he pays not the least attention to the Targum, though he cannot rid himself of the Vulgate, which is based on the Targum.</page><page sequence="31">BIBLICAL LITERATURE-REIDER 181 The Essays on the Psalmistst3O were delivered as Public Lectures in Oxford during the winter of 1925-26, and, according to the editor, attracted large audiences. Hugo Gressmann furnished "The Develop- ment of Hebrew Psalmody," in which he argues that Hebrew psalmody is in its origin pre-Davidic, that many psalms are pre-exilic and some also post-exilic, but that there are no Maccabean psalms whatsoever in the Davidic Psalter. However, he assumes an Egyptian and Babylonian influence. An Egyptian influence is also advocated by Dr. Blackman in his essay "The Psalms in the Light of Egyptian Research," while Mr. Driver, after due comparison, will not admit a Babylonian derivation in his essay "The Psalms in the Light of Babylonian Research." In addition, Dr. Theodore H. Robinson discourses interestingly on "The God of the Psalmists" and "The Eschatology of the Psalmists," while H. Wheeler Robinson contributes "The Inner Life of the Psalmists" and "The Social Life of the Psalmists." The editor in his introduction points out the present state of criticism of the Psalter, Higher Criticism giving way to the comparative study of religion, thus leading up to the present essays. He finds comfort in the consideration that through such scientific study "the Christian Church, on the one hand, will the more appreciate the significance of its Jewish origin; and the Jewish Church, on the other hand, may ultimately realize the true goal of its develop- ment and follow in the footsteps of Saul of Tarsus." Wismar's volume of Studies in the Psalter'3' deals with only two psalms of great significance to the Lutheran Church-46, styled "The Church; Her Comfort and Security," and 119, labelled "Faithful Adherence to the Divinely Revealed Word"-and is intended primarily for Lutheran readers. The commentary is devotional rather than scientific. The sixty-eighth Psalm, sometimes designated "the Titan among the Psalms" on account of its vigorous diction and involved phraseology, is probably the most difficult and baffling psalm in the entire Psalter. For many years it has formed the battle ground upon which biblical exegetes 130 The Psalmists.

It has been dated anywhere between the tenth and first century B.C.E., according to the whim and preconceived notion of the particular commentator, who is able to bend the text to his will. Cannon'32 writes a well-proportioned volume on this single psalm, endeavoring to prove that it originated at the celebration held after the erection of the gates of Jerusalem by Nehemiah (circa 445), its author being one of the participants in the festal procession. This new view is corroborated by a number of cogent arguments from the text, wnich at times sound quite convincing. There is this to be said in favor of Cannon's theory that it accounts for every word of the Hebrew text, apart from a few corrections and emendations. This is a decided advance over Duhm, Briggs, et al., who are compelled to eliminate almost a fourth of the Masoretic text in order to clinch their argument. Altogether, Cannon's attitude is conservative like that of Driver, and it is refreshing to state his principle of exegesis: "Interpretations which rest on extensive alterations of text are desperate expedients. The editors who adopt such a system have renounced the explanation of the poem and are explaining something else. It is not to be thought that such a system can ultimately give satisfaction or that an enduring exegesis can be built up on the shifting and insecure basis of subjective criticism . . . It is the duty of an expositor to explain the text as he finds it and not to leave out large portions, and this is the reason why the older commentaries are often found by a student to be much more helpful than their modern successors" (p. 57). His treatment is authori- tative and exhaustive. In a long introduction of 40 pages he reviews all former attempts to explain the psalm, pointing out their failure; then he proceeds to his own exposition and its justification, winding up with a discussion on supposed interpolations and the Latin texts of the psalm. The book is marred by a number of misprints, particularly in quoting the masoretic text. Of reconstructions of the text of the Book of Job there seems to be no end. Every year brings a number of new efforts to recover the sup- posedly original text, with the aid of the ancient versions or by means of conjecture alone, but somehow these reconstructions fail to make a lasting impression and their usefulness is at best problematical and 132 The 68th Psalm.

Dr. Buttenwieser,I33 who, like many of his predecessors, is convinced of the corruption of the masoretic text of Job, has applied himself for a number of years to the remodelling of this difficult text and to the remedying of its apparent discrepancies and seeming inconsistencies. His reconstruction consists chiefly in the rearrangement of chapters 16-37, removing sections, verses, and even parts of verses from one place to another, whereby he gains a more logical connection and a more coherent argumentation. It must be admitted that he handles his material deftly and authoritatively, exhibiting a fine knowl- edge of Hebrew idiom and a thorough mastery of the critical apparatus; moreover, he operates with the existing biblical material, which he only shifts from one place to another, and refrains as much as possible from creating new words and phrases to fill in certain gaps; nay, he is even frank enough to admit sometimes that he cannot solve certain difficult passages and hence omits them from the reconstructed text. For these reasons his reconstruction may be considered as one of the best in recent years, though a certain element of arbitrariness still clings to it and it is very far from the goal of finality. In his introduction Butten- wieser takes the view that the Book of Job is independent of an Assyrian or Egyptian source, that the Job mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel is not the same as in our book, that the prologue is from the same hand as the dialogues, though the happy ending in the epilogue (42, 10, 12-17) is a later addition, that the Elihu speeches, originally consisting of ch. 32-33 only, are interpolated and do not belong to the original Book of Job, that the book was composed during the Persian period, approxi- mately 400 B.C.E. Buttenwieser is of the opinion that the Book of Job is not really a didactic poem, a part of Wisdom literature, but a stirring drama of the human soul, in which the problem of suffering is discussed from various angles, Job believing himself an innocent victim while his friends defend the theory of retributive justice. Emphasis is laid on the fact that Job does not believe in immortality and resurrec- tion, as is oftentimes accepted, that he hopes for vindication in his lifetime, not after his death. Furthermore, Buttenwieser believes that the object of God's revelation is not to condemn Job, as generally accepted, but rather to vindicate him in the eyes of his friends. He bases this belief on the Septuagint version of 38.2: Who is it that seeketh to conceal his design from me, '33 The Book of Job. By MOSES BUTTENWIESER, Ph. D. New York: The MACMILLAN COMPANY, 1922.

Dost thou think I would have revealed myself to thee, Were it not that thou mightst be proven righteous! both of which he adopts in lieu of the masoretic text. His argument that chapters 38-39 are addressed by God to Job's friends (or to Eliphaz as their representative) and only 40 f. is directed to Job is not quite convincing, since it is based on mere conjecture and is not substantiated by any of the ancient versions. It is remarkable that though Butten- wieser is aware that the Septuagint version of Job is free and para- phrastic, and sometimes even corrupt, yet he makes it the chief corner- stone for his reconstruction of the Hebrew text and he proceeds to render its variants into supposed Hebrew idiom. Buttenwieser did well in offering a vocalized Hebrew text, as reconstructed by him, at the end of the book, so that the student may be able to compare it with the masoretic text. The new English translation is quite praise- worthy for its plainness and exactness. It is to be regretted that the Hebrew words quoted in the comments are in transliteration instead of in Hebrew letters. Surely, such a scholarly book is not written for laymen but for theological students who are familiar with the Hebrew alphabet. The book is provided with introductory chapters, compre- hensive notes and synopses, as well as a preface and index. Ball's commentary on the Book of JobI34 is philological: it teems with comparisons from Oriental languages and literatures, including Egyptian and Chinese. But above all it stands under the Sumerian influence, registering nearly 200 Sumerisms in the book. This was to be anticipated from Ball's "Semitic and Sumerian" (Hilprecht Anniversary Volume, 1909) and "Shumer and Shem" (Proceedings of the British Academy, vol. VII, 1915) in which he endeavored to prove the original biliteral forms of Semitic roots. Yet this view is as one-sided as the view of the Arabists who endeavor to find Arabisms in every difficult passage of the Book of Job. The latter has had its day, and now no doubt the former will have to pass muster. Thus exegesis constitutes a swinging of the pendulum to one extreme or the other. Naturally enough, Ball considers 34 The Book of Job. A Revised Text and Version. By C. J. BALL. With preface by C. F. BURNEY. Oxford: At the CLARENDON PRESS, 1922.

It is interesting that Ball assumes a negative attitude towards German commentators of the radical wing, like Duhm and his confreres, yet he employs the same canons of criticism as they, emending and inventing at will, sometimes without any semblance of authority or support.. He even adheres strictly to the newly formed metrical theories and on this basis rules out many essential words and passages. This is apparently in disagreement with Burney's conservative statement in the preface: "Those of us who have worked for many years at the text of the Old Testament may have been responsible for the suggestion of a large number of emendations in corrupt and difficult passages; yet few indeed are the passages in which we can flatter ourselves that we have actually recovered the original, and settled the textual difficulty once and for all." It is difficult to see why Ball spends so much energy on the Septuagint of Job which is notoriously corrupt and exhibits a lamentable lack of knowledge of the Hebrew original. Surely it was not necessary to retranslate into Hebrew every Septuagint variant as if it were of great importance. It is in these retranslations that Ball betrays a lack of knowledge of Hebrew idiom (in spite of Burney's testimony that Ball evinces a "masterly grasp of Hebrew idiom"), as may be seen from 2. 9, 4. 2 etc. The carelessness with which he treats the Septuagint is exemplified in 18. 13 nm 1iizm i"n= 5', for which the Greek has Kare6erat rTd cpata aVrov Oavaros. Ball puts this into Hebrew thus: nl] 1i'L. ~.W, notwithstanding the sug- gestion of Schleusner, s. v., that wpata might stand for =iiz. Very likely, however, G read n?r for lnm, or perhaps even in=. Other reconstructions are not much better: 5. 5 oinrt il for '3= mN i1 is an easy way to escape difficulty, likewise 15. 29 Dlit for =hw; 25. 5 -nny for ny (construed as perf. of nny); 27. 6 oiD ,'= ,1 9 nn,' i "my heart reproacheth me not with a fault," an impossible construction, etc. Another lack of familiarity with Hebrew custom: the author suggests that the number of Job's sons and daughters, 7 + 3 = 10, may be got out of the name m1'K, since ="t' = 1 + 2 = 3, and 1K = 1 + 6 = 7, while = 10, the perfect number, gives the sum of the two; but more in line with Jewish practice of calculation would be the equivalence of = 1, the four letters yielding a total of 10. An ample introduction discusses various phases of the Book of Job, chiefly its relation to the Babylonian Job. According to the author there is no immortality</page><page sequence="36">186 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW implied in Job (19. 25-27). Ball assumes that the Book of Job in its present form, except the Elihu speeches which constitute a later inter- polation, was composed during the Persian period, approximately 500 B.C.E. The new English version is in meter and exhibits few peculiari- ties. It is interesting to note that Ball spells Eyob and Iahvah in the commentary, though using Job in the introduction. The Rev. Devine's book on JobI35 "is not a commentary, but the sympathetic study of an experience, not intended for scholars, but for the general reader." And yet it bears the characteristics of a commen- tary, since each chapter is prefaced by the biblical text pertaining thereto, derived from the Revised Version. True, it is not a word for word commentary but rather a running exposition of the general sense of a phrase or a sentence or a section, as the case might be. Moreover, it emphasizes literary values and adduces analogies from the foremost English authors. An introduction discusses the general problem of pain and retribution and its treatment outside of the Bible. An appendix gives a brief bibliography, and then discusses the age of the Book of Job, Satan, After-Life, the Prologue and Epilogue, the Speeches of Elihu, and the Christian answer to the Book of Job. This is followed by a general index. Like the Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes Thilo's Book of Job136 is translated into rhythmic prose and briefly commented upon from a non-theological standpoint. The masoretic text is adhered to, except in a few cases where vocalic and consonantal changes are introduced. Two very difficult passages (15.29 and 20.23) remain untranslated. In opposition to most modern exegetes Thilo construes the entire Book of Job as a well wrought and logically constructed composition in which there is nothing either defective or redundant, and in an excursus at the end of the book he endeavors to prove that the Elihu speeches as well as chapter 28 in praise of wisdom are integral parts of the poem of Job and are properly set in its artistic frame. There is no gainsaying the fact that Thilo operates with common sense and in this way often obtains better results than some of the biblical pundits with their abstruse analyses. His translation is quite attractive, and his brief notes are sometimes very instructive. 135 The Story of Job. A sympathetic study of the Book of Job in the light of history and literature.

Now this kind of interpretation has become a great favorite with professors of English at colleges and universities, who find it worth their while to reinterpret separate books of the Bible in the same manner as they would a Greek or Latin classic. There is an irresistible charm in such a performance which no true litterateur can withstand. Not alone the soi-disant profanation is alluring, but also the great human dramas which are developed so stirringly in every book. The literary analysis by Prof. John S. Flory'37 covers the two interesting books of Job and Canticles and constitutes an effort to elucidate and simplify the actions and thoughts of those two poems, epic and idyl. And this effort is "an effort to trace a line of thought rather than to discover subtle meanings of words," which precludes any philological discussion. Nevertheless the author takes his standpoint on general principles that the Book of Job goes back to patriarchal times and was composed perhaps in the days of Moses, and similarly that the Song of Songs goes back to the age of King Solomon and was perhaps composed by Solomon himself. The specific grounds for such an assumption are not given. Job is said to be in the form of a drama in five acts, besides the prologue and epilogue. But the term drama is used here in a very primitive and rather loose sense, meaning nothing more than spoken language in the form of a dialogue. Similarly the Song of Songs is construed as the personal experiences of Solomon with the Shulammite maiden. Needless to say, there is no new light thrown on these two books, as the author modestly admits in his introduction. In the Symposium on the Song of Songs'38 Prof. Margolis presents the problem "How the Song of Songs entered the Canon." His view is that it entered the Canon at an early date, when the cleavage between holy and secular was not yet very pronounced. He justly makes the observation that "the three parts of the Canon-the Pentateuch, the Prophets, and the Hagiographa-originated simultaneously and each grew to its present dimensions by a long evolution which consisted in '37 Dramas of the Bible.

Prof. Montgomery pictures the Song of Songs in early and medieval Christian use. Prof. Hyde points out Greek analogies and Prof. Edgerton Hindu analogues to the Song of Songs. The larger contributions are by Prof. Meek, who places the book at a very early date and derives it from the fertility cult so current in the Orient, and Mr. Schoff, who supports Meek's view by an enumeration of the offering lists in the book, from which he concludes that 134 substances are suited to the ancient Tammuz cult, 126 to the cult of the first and 7 to the cult of the second temple. One thing stands out among the divergent views in the symposium: the preponderance of opinion inclines towards placing the Song of Songs at a very early date, in contrast to the late date of the radical critics. Vulliaud,139 whose interest centers in esoteric studies, wishes to restore the mystic and cabbalistic interpretation of the Song of Songs, according to which the lover is God and the beloved the people of Israel or the Synagogue. He traces the development of this mode of interpretation throughout the ages, dwelling particularly on the Talmud, Midrash and Targum, whose allegorical comments are well known. But above everything else the Zohar, of which there is a French transla- tion by Pauly, forms his source of inspiration and the standard of comprehension of the biblical text. Naturally, he eschews philological exposition, claiming that it never leads to a satisfactory solution of the difficulties that present themselves. A good deal of space is taken up with an attack upon the rationalistic school of expositors, especially Renan and Haupt and their immoral insinuations. Altogether the book is more controversial than expository. There is a fresh French translation of the Hebrew text with few explanatory notes on the margin, among them Rashi's old French renderings of Hebrew words. The book is beautifully printed, though mistakes are discernible here and there, especially in Hebrew and German quotations. Dr. Mardrus, the new French translator of The Thousand and One Nights (1902-1905), has undertaken a new literal and complete transla- tion of Semitic texts dealing with the perennial subject of love. The Queen of Sheba headed the list, and now follows the Song of Songs.140 39 PAUL VULLIAUD. Le Cantique des Cantiques d'apras la Tradition Juive. Paris: Les PRESSES UNIVERSITAIRES de FRANCE.

The book is divided into eight poems, arranged in dialogues between the lover and the beloved. The translation is free rather than literal, sometimes departing even from the sequence of the Hebrew text, which leads to the inevitable conclusion that it was made from a version and not from the original Hebrew. However, this is not much of a flaw in a book which aims to be an artistic and literary product before everything else. And an artistic product it is, both for its beautiful make-up and its mellifluous French style which is so well suited to the subject in question. Dr. Thilo follows up his new translation and exposition of the Song of Songs by a new translation and exposition of the Book of Ecclesi- astes.'4' As in the former so also in the latter the translation is neither free nor literal, the main purpose being to get the proper sense in as good a German as possible, while the comment is succinct, subordinated to the end of the translation. The latter is not always justified, as, e. g., in the case of 2. 8 nlmwi nrw, which is rendered "numberless girls" in addition to the preceding nimiyn "eroticism." Nor are authorities quoted for such doubtful renderings. More explicit are the philosophical and exegetical comments at the end of each section of the translation and the general summary of Koheleth's views on life at the end of the book, where the author also airs his conviction of the unity of the Book of Ecclesiastes. The theory of multiplicity of sources in the Book of Ecclesiastes appears to be on the wane. The newer commentators seem to realize that the whole book, in spite of its apparent contradictions, was written by one man who contemplated existence from different angles and mused upon its various phases. The same holds true also of Allgeier's commentary on Koheleth,I42 which insists on unity of authorship and explains the various elements of the book (pessimism, hedonism, fear of God) as different flashes of the same mind. He rightly points to the 141 Der Prediger Salomo. Neu iibersetzt und auf seinen Gedankengang untersucht von Lic. Dr. MARTIN THILO. Bonn: A. MARCUS und E. WEBERS VERLAG, 1923.

The commentary is brief and contains very little that is original. So is the introduction too brief, hardly touching the various problems of the difficult book. The translation is done into poetical lines, following the sense but not according to any meter. Here and there slips are noticea- ble, as, e. g., when "Rashi, Yarhi, Ibn Ezra" are mentioned among Hebrew commentators of Koheleth (p. 17), not realizing that the first two names are those of one and the same person. Kuhn's exposition of the Book of Koheleth'43 does not add much to the existing knowledge of this perplexing book of the Bible. The emenda- tions suggested here and there in difficult passages lack that insight into the Hebrew idiom which is necessary to recommend them to the thoughtful reader. Sometimes they even sound colorless and insipid. The following may serve as a specimen: 12. 11 'y~xn c'yl nlmionDo rnnK yurD irn nliD, rendered "and like nails planted in the planks of ships, which are put there.without one being broken." On the other hand, the author deserves credit for his belief in the unity of authorship in spite of apparent contradictions and seeming discrepancies in the book: the latter he explains in his introduction as logical in a universal and all-embracing mind like that of Koheleth. Koheleth to him is the representative of wisdom, popular and openly-preached wisdom, which finds its counterpart in the exclusive and restricted wisdom of Shulamith in the Song of Songs. One wonders at the many relations the author finds between Koheleth and the New Testament: to him the former is a vestibule to the latter, and in an appendix at the close of the book he points out a number of passages in which both agree. The author appends notes explaining some peculiar readings in the ancient versions of the Book of Ecclesiastes. In an age of uncritical and wild emendations of the biblical text on the basis of the Greek version the caveat of Dr. Bewer'44 is timely and opportune: in advancing emendations of the masoretic text it is not 143 Erkldrung des Buches Koheleth.

The biblical critic and commentator should be made aware that there are many variants within the Septua- gint, and that even such prominent codices as A and B often differ in their readings. The original Septuagint is probably farther from our attainment than the original Hebrew, and hence expositors and exegetes should be careful in eniending the Hebrew through the Greek text. This is a truism, which has been expressed before with reference to other books of the Bible, but Dr. Bewer discusses it with reference to the Book of Ezra, where discrepancies between the Hebrew and the Greek text abound. The author holds that the Hebrew is far superior to the Greek text, and he takes Jahn and Batten to task for their numerous superficial emendations of the Hebrew on the basis of the Greek text. In many of these cases he is able to prove that the underlying Greek is corrupt and presupposes a different reading in consonance with the masoretic text. As to discrepancies in numbers (such as between Ezra ch. 2 and Nehemiah ch. 7), he explains them through a linear numeral system, such as appears on the Elephantine Papyri, which could easily lead to mistakes. He exhibits great ingenuity in disentangling some of these apparent discrepancies, and on the whole shows sound judgment and critical acumen with regard to the ancient versions. He leans greatly on Torrey's Ezra Studies (1910), which first paved the way for a sound estimate of this historical book, but he differs from Torrey in his conclusion that the Greek text of B is not much better than that of A in Ezra and that both must be used with caution. Ditmass45 gives an outline of the history in Ezra and Nehemiah, following the order of the Authorized Version of the Bible except in three instances pointing to incongruities and discrepancies (Ezra ch. 4, 6 to 7, Nehem. 8). This is preceded by a sketch of the historical and political background and followed by an outline of Persian history from Cyrus to Artaxerxes I, as well as a detailed time-chart.

Of course, he claims to have consulted the Hebrew text wherever it yielded superior readings, but very little of it is evident in the commentary, which is altogether expository and not at all philological. Yet it is fairly critical, and helps to elucidate somewhat a difficult text. Since the rediscovery of the Ethiopic Book of Henoch it was con- sidered self-evident that the figure of the Son of Man or the Elect One which appears in some of the parables is a real individuality, namely the so-called Messiah. Dr. Messel 47advances the view that the Son of Man here, as in Daniel, from which it was most likely derived, is a personification of the Jewish people, and accordingly the passages which now speak of a personal Messiah must be looked upon as corrupt, remodelled, or falsely translated. These parables were especially subject to misconstruction and remodelling since the Christian Church very naturally understood the Son of Man in an individual sense. Dr. Messel is able to demonstrate, however, that the genuine texts dealing with the Son of Man contain very few individual features, while their vague terminology suits the Jewish people very well. He believes that these parables came into existence during the time of the Roman procurators.
