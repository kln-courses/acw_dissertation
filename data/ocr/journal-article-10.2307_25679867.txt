<plain_text><page sequence="1">Divine Beauty and the Grotesque in Dante's Paradiso ALISON MILBANK University of Nottingham Since the publication in 1957 of the English translation of Walter Kayser's influential study The Grotesque in Art and Literature, attention to the monstrous, hybrid, and excessive in aesthetics has grown apace. Whereas for Kayser in post war Germany the grotesque was an emblem of alienation, revealing the incom prehensible and demonic forces underlying our seemingly rational world, for many contemporary critics the grotesque has become a broadly positive concep tion.1 For a postmodern sensibility, any transgression of categories, any ques tioning of the neoclassical symmetry of the beautiful can be given a positive valence, and Bakhtin's celebratory presentation of the grotesque body as an image of cosmic and social renewal has had an enormous appeal.2 Feminist and postcolonial critics in particular have found there a language for challenging the abjection of the 'other' while also validating that same monstrosity as excessive and liberatory.3 The grotesque has had a similar appeal to Christian literary critics for whom the monstrous ugliness of the cross is a central and paradoxically positive image. Parallel to secular recuperations runs a line of protestant reflection in which the grotesque offers a redemptive experience through an acceptance of our own fallenness. In James Luther Adams's words, 'it releases us to a state that embraces the evil which always shall have been, to one that accepts the horror which can break out at any moment'.4 This state is one of acceptance of the 'shadow self that is akin to the communal carnival of the dying/living, killing/murdered 1 Wolfgang Kayser, The Grotesque in Art and literature, trans, by Ulrich Weisstein (New York: Columbia Univer sity Press, 1981), p. 188. 2 Mikhail Bakhtin, Rabelais and his World, trans, by Helene Iswolsky (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1984), pp. 303-67. 3 See, for example, Margaret Miles, 'Carnal Abominations: The Female Body as Grotesque', in The Grotesque in Art and Literature: Theological Reflections, ed. by James Luther Adams and Wilson Yates (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1997), pp. 83-112; Christine Ross, 'Redefinitions of Abjection in Contemporary Performance of the Female Body', in Modern Art and the Grotesque, ed. by Frances S.

In my view, both Bakhtin's collapse of antinomies in the grotesque body as well as the quasi-Jungian union of evil and good in Luther Adams actually annul the grotesque effect. How can one have a monstrous contradiction if the poles of sacred and profane or of good and evil are resolved? Contemporary attempts at blasphemous art, such as Andres Serrano's photograph Tiss Christ', only work as producers of meaning if the sacred and profane are in tension. What I hope to demonstrate in my analysis of Dante's Commedia is a way in which the grotesque offers a vision of the mystery of God and reality without losing its own monstrous character. In theological terms, this is a call away from the tragic theology of the late twentieth century to a more patristic and medieval conception of evil as nothing in itself but a lack, a privation of good, and towards a theology of participation in the Divine life. In literary terms, I offer a new reading of Dante's aesthetics that is effected through recourse both to neo-Platonic traditions in Christian theology and to the nineteenth-century writer John Ruskin, whose own reflections on the grotesque were themselves the fruit of his Dante studies. Although Dante's poem is often cited by writers on the grotesque as a key literary example of the mode, there has been little critical attention to the monstrosity of his infernal creations.6 Two recent discussions, by Dorothea Scholl and Ular Ploom, are confined to the Inferno.7 The reason for this neglect in a period of such intense interest in the grotesque is perhaps due to the fact that beauty is more central to Dante's vision than ugliness. From the canzoni of his youthful aesthetic credo Vita JVuova to the epic love poem of the Commedia, Dante traces his conversion from earthly to heavenly beauty by means of the radiance of the lady Beatrice, whose eyes, in neo-Platonic fashion, 'enoble all she looks upon' and whose smile brings silence and reverence.8 Encountered 5 Yates, 'An Introduction to the Grotesque', pp. 20-9. 6 See, for example, Victor Hugo's Preface to Cromwell, ed. by Annie Ubersfeld (Paris: Garnier-Flammarion, 1986), in which Dante is central as exemplar of the grotesque.

Drawn through Paradise by the lure of her eyes and smile, Dante is changed from glory into glory and prepared for the beatific vision of the origin of all beauty, mediated through the spiritual radiance of the Blessed Virgin herself (the most beautiful woman in the world, according to Albert the Great) as hymned by her troubadour St Bernard of Clairvaux.9 The topography of the afterlife in the Commedia is similarly aestheticized as a development from ugliness to beauty, because sin is seen as a deformation of the good, resulting in the spoiling of the divine image, although it is never completely lost.10 Even in Inferno there is an intelligibility to the damned and their circumstances. And Thomas Aquinas argued that Satan himself is not without some good.11 His pride, anger, and avarice may deform his angelic nature to the bestial, but he remains in possession of being, which is good in itself. And through the punishments of the damned, the reader can discern the nature of sin as a perversion of the good, the true, and the beautiful. Bertran de Born, for example, the troubadour who used his rhetorical skills to foment civil war, speaks in Inferno from a head separated from his body, which is held aloft like a lamp by its separated arm.12 The image is disgusting and grotesque in that it monstrously deforms the human shape and integrity while challenging our sense of categorization. A man here is both one person and two parts, both subject and object: 'they were two in one and one in two ? how this can be, He knows who so ordains'.13 'Behold in me the contrapasso\ Bertran declaims, meaning literally 'a step against', which in this case is illustrated by a physical embodiment that has the transgressive and disturbing quality of a nail peeled off, or an eyelid rolled inside out. The grotesque character of his punishment, however, is what enables its intelligibility and allows us to make sense of it. Although Bertran makes his separated head a lantern to light his steps, 'lanterna? 9 Albert the Great, De Laudibus Beatae Marine, quoted by Anne W. Astell in Eating Beauty: The Eucharist and the Spiritual Arts of the Middle Ages (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2006), p. 59. Albert, like other writers, including Bernard, cites the Song of Solomon 4. 7: 'you are altogether beautiful, my love' (New Revised Standard Version). The beauty of Mary is also a constant theme of Bernard's Sermones in Cantica Canticorum. 10 As Thomas Aquinas notes in his commentary on Dionysius, 'Every form, by which a thing has being [esse], is a participation in the divine brilliance. This is why he [Dionysius] adds that "individual things" are "beautiful according to a character of their own," that is, in accord with a proper form. Hence it is clear that the being [esse] of all things is derived from the divine Beauty'; Exposito in Dion. De Div.

Indeed, this adds an element of claritas ? a central feature of beauty in the Middle Ages ? to his portrayal in one and the same moment, as it marks his distance from true form and beauty.14 Thus already we can see that to 'read' a character as grotesque or disgusting is neither to reduce him or her to abjection, nor to pass over and sublime the image. Rather, the contradiction itself is the insight: in Augustinian fashion, the distance from proper form becomes evident and is the point of redemptive realization. A homely analogy would be the presence of excrement on one's doormat. In itself, excrement is not particularly grotesque: it becomes so by being in the wrong place. A marble bust is not grotesque; a severed head is grotesque because it is a perversion of the body's integrity. To register this fact is to witness to the goodness of the human bodily form and to mark as wrong its dispersal. As Dante descends further into the depths of hell, the relatively beautiful forms of Paolo and Francesca, who appear like doves, and the noble Farinata upright in his fiery tomb give way to monstrous deformations and displacements of the body, such as souls inside trees, soothsayers with their heads on backwards, and hideously dropsical bodies of forgers. Satan himself is the epitome of the grotesque in having three heads and the flanks of a hairy beast, and each of his three mouths chomping on a different sinner's body. His is also the most extreme metamorphosis: from gloriously resplendent angelic form to bestial impotence. Yet Dis, too, may be read grotesquely, for, as every commentator points out, his three heads parody the Trinity. Furthermore, as has not perhaps been noticed, his immersion in the ice of Cocytus parodies the immersion of Christ in the waters of Jordan, where his baptism points to an identification and solidarity with the created order. Again, the very distance of Dis from the Divine is the source of the grotesque effect. The shock remains but proceeds from an ethical as well as an aesthetic repulsion. As Scholl notes, the infernal grotesque accords with the moral allegory of the poem.15 In Purgatorio there is still a grotesque quality to the purgation of the lower sins, such as pride, which entails the bearing of a heavy stone that bends the body over in the manner of a stone figure on the corbel bracket in a gothic cathedral, like a literal grotesque. By the time of the soul's arrival in the Earthly Paradise, however, the divine image has been restored as it was in Eden before the Fall. Paradoxically, it is after being purged of lust in the fire that souls become truly beautiful and attractive, and Dante is able to appreciate the loveliness of Matelda, who 'warms [herself] at love's beams'.16 The souls encountered in 14 On claritas see Aquinas, Summa Theologica, ia, q. 39, art. 8, in 11 (1912), p. 147. 15 Scholl, p. 99. 16 'che a' raggi d'amore | ti scaldi'; Purgatorio 28. 43-4, pp. 304-5.</page><page sequence="5">ALISON MILBANK I59 Paradise are thereafter seen as lambent flames of light, swathed in increasing degrees of radiance and of ecstatic movement as Dante ascends to spheres ever closer to the Empyrean. Until Paradiso 31, when Dante is given an anticipation of the resurrection, the bodies of the blessed are not present, and so light in varying degrees of intensity becomes the way to convey an increase of beauty and conformity to the Divine. From this brief sketch it may seem as if Dante is charting a powerful but relatively straightforward journey from the ugliness and fixity of hell, through an acceptance and conversion of one's moral ugliness in Purgatory, to the beauty and radiance of Paradise. This picture is complicated, however, by the grotesque use to which Dante puts his allusions to Ovid's Metamorphoses. Allegorized, Ovid's poem was a popular source of moral exempla for medieval writers, but Dante employs it more literally, making frequent use of its range of violent transmuta tions to delineate the changes and losses of form that the damned undergo in Inferno, such as the thieves in Inferno 25, whose refusal to respect the property of others now leads to them losing their own bodies as they transmute back and forth from snake to human form.17 What is even more surprising is the recur rence of Ovidian metamorphosis in Paradise. In the very first canto the narrator calls on Apollo to 'enter into my breast and breathe there as when you drew Marsyas from the sheath of his limbs',18 referring to the horrendous punishment that the god enacted on his rival music maker in Metamorphoses 6. 385-91. It is one of the most appalling of all the violent changes of the Latin poem: his skin is stripped off the surface of his body, and he is all one wound: blood flows down on every side, the sinews lie bare, his veins throb and quiver with no skin to cover them: you could count the entrails as they palpitate, and the vitals showing clearly in his breast.19 Dante has chosen this analogy carefully. In the same way that the deformation of Bertran's headless trunk makes clear Divine justice, so the flayed body of the satyr both deforms but also reveals the architecture of the human (or satyr) body. The story has long been associated with the history of music. In Ovid's Fasti 6. 697-708, Marsyas's story is part of an explanation for the masked character of flute players. Here Marsyas gains the flute (aulos) that leads to his undoing 17 On medieval allegorization of Ovid see Ernst Curtius, European literature and the Latin Middle Ages, trans, by Willard Trask, Bollingen Series, 36 (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1952), esp. pp. 17-18 and 164-5 on Dante and Ovid.

Her shock and distaste at the grotesque figure she presents cause her to abandon the instrument. The flute is thus contrasted with the lyre of the beautiful Apollo as its antonym, to be associated with the hybrid satyrs, who are half beast, and also with Pan, as a grotesque and indecorous mode of music-making. One tradition has it that Apollo makes Marsyas's skin into a quasi-lyre, thus asserting the supremacy of stringed over wind instruments.20 However, the stress on the palpitating flesh in the Meta morphoses version of the story suggests, rather, that Marsyas himself becomes music, and inaugurates the association between music, expressivity, and suffer ing that is so important during the Renaissance, informing paintings such as Titian's The Flaying of Marsyas of 1570-76. Hence, in inviting Apollo to breathe in him rather than strike him like a lyre, Dante privileges the grotesque flute over the beautiful lyre, or, in other words, he rereads the Marsyas story as one of Apollo lending himself to the body that he slays: 'O divine Power, if you do so lend yourself to me'.21 Apollo must blow out his cheeks grotesquely so that the living, human body of Dante may set forth the vision of heaven that he saw while still in the flesh. The concept of trasumanar ('to go beyond the human') is itself a monstrous conception and requires a grotesque as well as a beautiful expression. John Ruskin, who wrote extensively on grotesque poetics in Modern Painters, speaks of three modes: first, the irrationally playful exercise of the imagination; secondly, the art that arises from the contemplation of terrible and evil things; and thirdly, 'art arising from the confusion of the imagination by the presence of truths which it cannot grasp'.22 It is Ruskin's third category that is most appropriate to Dante's usage in Paradiso. Neither Dante nor his readers can grasp how he was able to rise bodily to the spheres, so the grotesque is the most appropriate mode to describe the experience, as well as separate it from the bodily assumption of the Blessed Virgin, who by grace was prevented from sin and raised to glory. Dante's invocation to Apollo is followed in the same canto by another reference to Ovid's Metamorphoses, to the story of Glaucus in Book xm. 904-59, 19 'Clamanti cutis est summos direpta per artus, | Nec quicquam nisi vulnus erat; cruor undique manat, | Detectique patent nervi, trepidaeque sine ulla | Pelle micant venae; salientia viscera possis | Et perlucentes numerare in pectore fibras', in Ovidius Naso, Metamorphoses, ed. by Rudolfus Ehwald (Leipzig: B.

The instrument Marsyas becomes is made to sound by the wind, so that he becomes a literal 'windbag'. His music thus has a parodic quality. (The supremacy of strings over winds lasts to this day in the American education system, in which students with violins form the orchestra, but the wind players only the marching band.) 21 'O divina virtu, se mi ti presti'; Paradiso, 1. 22, pp. 4-5. 22 John Ruskin, The Works of John Ruskin, ed. by E.

Where the tears of those woodland creatures who mourned Marsyas became a river, here the fisherman becomes enamoured of the sea to such an extent that he enters it as his proper element. Again, there are grotesque features to the story. It is watching the fish on land moving seawards that causes Glaucus to eat the grass they lie on: he believes it to be magical. He thus imitates the bestial in order, paradoxically, to be divinized. Where Marsyas intentionally sought divine power, Glaucus comes upon it by accident, which certainly gives credence to Charles Singleton's claim that this story and the trasumanar experience mark the Pilgrim's sanctification by grace ? the free gift of God rather than something accessible by human effort.23 Glaucus is divinized in the same way that the human person is in Christian conceptions of participation and enjoyment of the beatific vision, but the process has grotesque features, which leave Glaucus with a green beard, sea-blue arms, and a fish's tail. His hybrid appearance makes it difficult for the nymph Scylla to decide whether he is a god or a monster.24 The irony here is that the telos for humanity, according to scholastic theology, is a supernatural one.25 As G. K. Chesterton puts it: man is both 'a creator moving miraculous hands and fingers and a kind of cripple'.26 He is both divine and a monster. Therefore, in a sense, we are all Glaucuses who have a desire in us for the sea that is God, and Dante will develop this marine language in Piccarda's speech in Paradiso 3: 'in His will is our peace. It is that sea to which all moves, both what It creates and what nature makes'.27 The natural imagery for the supernatural reality is the chiasmic pair with the supernatural character of our natural end, and the para doxical nature of this truth makes a grotesque duality an appropriate image, especially since much of our true nature has been lost after the Fall. While employment of metamorphosis might seem appropriate to convey the experience of heaven to a mortal still in the flesh, Dante goes much further than this, associating metamorphosis with God himself. Bizarrely, Ovid's Meta morphoses reappear in the final vision of Paradiso, in which the poet is granted a sight of the Trinitarian nature of God. He discerns three circles, of three colours and one magnitude, one seeming to be reflected by the other (the Father in the 23 Charles Singleton, Dante Studies, n: Journey to Beatrice (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1958), pp. 28-9. 24 Ovid, Metamorphoses, xin. 912-15: 'she could not tell | If he were god or monster, and she gazed | In wonder at his colour and his hair | That clothed his shoulders and streamed down his back, | And thighs that formed a twisting fish's tail', from Ovid, Metamorphoses, trans, by A.

In response to this vision Dante exclaims: 'O Light Eternal, who alone abidest in Thyself, and known to Thyself and knowing, lovest and smilest on Thyself.'28 The smiling here is a reference to Ovid's rendition of the story of the beautiful youth Narcissus, which had been one of the central motifs of the whole Comedy, from narcissistic Dis, fixed for ever gazing at his own monstrous reflection in the bottom of hell, to Dante's opposite mistake in the sphere of the moon, when he takes souls there to be merely reflections.29 Here the analogy is with Narcissus falling in love with his own image: 'Himself he longs for, longs unwittingly, | Praising is praised, desiring is desired | And love he kindles while with love he burns.'30 He addresses his reflection: 'When I smile | You smile' and this fact aids his recognition of the beloved as his own imaged self.31 The smile of Ovid's Narcissus, however, leads him to suffer doubleness, alienation, and lack; the Divine Narcissus is triune not double, and his smile is fructifying, without lack. Ovid's Narcissus is turned into a flower fixed by the water; the Divine Narcissus engenders an ever-growing rose, his love overflowing into creativity. Two different conceptions of beauty are also at work here. The Ovidian Narcissus represents a fixed, self-contained, inaccessible, and unobtainable perfection, whereas the Divine Narcissus is an image of engendering movement, of joy and participation. His smile, as with all the many smiles of the poem, is an emblem of beauty and its communicability, as with the smile of Beatrice cited earlier from the Vita Nuova. It is a disclosure of the Divine that brings about that which it reveals. So the virtues lead the confessed and watered Dante to Beatrice and pray for her to unveil her mouth, so 'that he may discern the second beauty that she conceals': her holy smile (fo santo riso).32 If the eyes engender understand ing, the lips register the joyful response of the desiring will. In the Convivio Dante describes laughter or the smile (the Italian word is ridere) as 'the scintillation of the soul's delight, that is, a gleam showing itself without, no otherwise than it exists within'; and later on he speaks of the eyes of wisdom being her 'demon strations, by the aid of which truth is seen with fullest certainty', and her smiles as 'her persuasions in which the inner light of wisdom is shown forth under a 28 'O luce etterna che sola in te sidi, | sola t'intendi, e da te intelletta | e intendente te ami e arridi!'; Paradiso, 33. 124-6, pp. 378-9. 29 On Dante's use of the Narcissus story see Robert McMahon, 'Ovid's Narcissus in the Commedia\ Pacific Coast Philology, 20.1-2 (1985), 65-9; Kevin Brownlee, 'Dante and Narcissus (Purgatorio xxx, 76-99)', Dante Studies, 96 (1978), 201-06; and R. A. Shoaf, Dante, Chaucer, and the Currency of the Word (Norman, OK: Pilgrim, 1983), pp. 1?99.

But they are paradoxical. In the sphere of Venus, the souls have what Robin Kirk patrick translates as a 'flash of clarity', but it comes from 'Pombra piena di letizia' or shades that are shown to be full of joy by that illumination.34 'Shade' and 'flash' here are opposites, but they act as the veil of the mouth does to the smile in Lady Wisdom in the Convivio. Before Dante has got anywhere near the famous punto of Paradiso 28. 16, when the universe turns itself inside out, and what seemed furthest and slowest of the spheres is shown to be swiftest and closest to God, he has seen how inverted our usual terms have to become to make sense of the paradisal beauty of the blest. Dante may say 'I see well how you do nest yourself in your own light, and that you dart it from your eyes, because it sparkles when you smile' to the shade he later learns to be Justinian, but all he actually sees is the brightening of the radiance.35 A physical gesture can only be a reflective analogy until the vision of the resurrected bodies of the just, when they are described as being 'adorned by the light of Another, and by their own smile'.36 Again, counter-intuitively, the fullest personhood ? Peter Hawkins describes these individual smiles as being like fingerprints ? and highest beatitude is expressed through the body.37 The emphasis on one's own smile also provides further evidence for the smile being linked to the will, and being also responsive to understanding, which is received through the eyes. The so-called 'Gothic smile' appears in church carvings in the thirteenth century in the laughing Madonnas of Germany and France, and is thereafter contagious, until saint smiles at saint across the portal arch throughout northern Europe.38 Hawkins has linked Dante's extensive use of smiling to poetry itself as a communicative art.39 In Paradise, the smile is most often indicative of the ecstatic love and unity of the blessed, and the operation of grace. Dante's last view of Beatrice is from the Rose, whence she smiles at him before turning her gaze back to the Divine fountain. A whole theology of beauty underlines the Gothic smile. As Pseudo Dionysius puts it in The Divine Names: 33 Dante Alighieri, Dante's Convivio, trans, by William Walrond Jackson (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1909), III. viii, p. 155; III. xv, p. 178. 34 Dante Alighieri, The Divine Comedy 3: Paradiso, trans.

So babies learn to smile by being smiled at. I smile at you and you smile back. Hawkins even suggests that the figure of the Divine humanity in the Trinity may be smiling back at Dante.41 But there is something rather odd about the smile of the divine Narcissus in Paradiso 33. Who or what is doing the smiling? Yes, Dante will later discern the human image within the Divine circling, but at present he sees the three circles smiling at one another. How can a ring smile? The image is grotesque, akin to the smile of Lewis Carroll's Cheshire Cat, which remains, hanging disembodied in the air, after the cat himself has disappeared.42 Only here we have actually two or even three smiles. At the sublime point of his great poem, the vision of the highest beauty, Dante gives us an impossible, oddly physicalized image.43 One might seek to argue that this is just a symbol, but Dante is quite careful to distinguish what he sees from similitudes. Here he addresses God directly in the second person singular. So why does Dante begin and end his Paradiso with Ovidian grotesquely? The reason, in my opinion, is that the poet wishes to be faithful to two important theological truths: first, the utter transcendence of God, and the impossibility of comprehending his essence; secondly, the theological importance of the body as a result of the Incarnation. It is, after all, with how the human image might fit with the Divine Being that Dante's vision fails here in the Empyrean. The first truth is central to Christian orthodoxy and has been much discussed by scholastic and mystical theology alike. As early as the sixth century, Pseudo Dionysius the Areopagite in The Divine Names both validated the attempt to attribute names and qualities to God and also pointed out how their articula tion must perforce have a somewhat paradoxical cast: we attribute to God both light and darkness, since he is beyond our understanding of light, being its 40 Pseudo-Dionysius, The Complete Works, trans, by Colm Luibheid with Paul Rorem, Classics of Western Spir ituality (London: SPCK, 1987), pp. 76-7. Thomas Aquinas emphasizes the same features of God's beauty in De Divinis Nominibus, Lectio 5, as discussed in John D.Jones, The Divine Names and Mystical Theology (Milwaukee, WI: Marquette University Press, 1980). In the quotation, Beauty 'bids' is in quotation marks to express the Greek pun on kallos, which means 'beautiful' and kaleo, 'I call', a pun to which Aquinas calls attention. 41 Hawkins, p. 381. The reflexive nature of the smile makes it analogous to the mode of participation as conceived by the neo-Platonic tradition as a series of mirrors, by which we receive light from above and reflect it below. 42 'This time [the Cheshire Cat] vanished quite slowly, beginning with the end of its tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time after the rest of it had gone'; Lewis Carroll, Alices Adventures in Wonder land, ed. by Richard Kelly (Peterborough, ON: Broadview, 2000), p. 101. 43 Earlier, in Paradiso 28. 83-4 (pp. 318-19) and 27. 4-5 (pp. 300-1), he has made the whole universe smile. In the latter, however, the verb sembiava emphasizes the figurative nature of the analogy; in the former, the smile is part of an extended simile about the onset of good weather.</page><page sequence="11">ALISON MILBANK 165 cause.44 So in Paradiso 33's vision of God as light, Dante experiences also an element of incommunicability, since God's light is beyond our capacity to understand here in this life.45 As Ruskin puts it: the fallen human soul, at its best, must be as a diminishing glass, and that a broken one, to the mighty truths of the universe round it; and the wider the scope of its glance, and the vaster the truths into which it obtains an insight, the more fantastic their distortion is likely to be.46 Despite his privileging of the apophatic and the transcendent, however, Dionysius does not decry the physicality of the language scripture applies to God: 'He is put on horses, on chariots, on thrones. Well-laid feasts are laid for him. He is represented as drinking, as inebriated, as someone hung-over' (p. 282). These images are so obviously physical that they do not mislead. Indeed, follow ing Dionysius, Thomas Aquinas privileges a phrase such as 'at the right hand of God' precisely because of its grotesque character, by which it draws attention to its limitation as a description of the ineffable.47 For Dionysius, such language enables 'the one capable of seeing the beauty hidden within these images to find that they are truly mysterious, appropriate to God, and filled with a great theological light' (p. 283). The grotesque character of the smiling circles, there fore, is first, to be noted by the reader as such, and secondly, it is to precipitate him or her by means of the disjunction itself into a deeper apprehension of God in which the truth of the image can be verified. This does not necessarily mean that the grotesque character of the image is surpassed, but that its grotesque character witnesses to a truth beyond our conceptual grasp. There has been a tendency in recent Dante scholarship, most notably in Christian Moevs's brilliant Metaphysics of Dante's 'Comedy \ not only to move Dante's vision in an apophatic direction, but even towards a divinization of the self that nullifies the specificity of the individual subject as he or she becomes one with God, or, as Moevs puts it, 'to experience oneself as one thing, all things, and no thing through the love that moves the sun and the other stars'.48 In my opinion, the grotesque insertions of the transformations of Glaucus, Marsyas, and Narcissus are in the service of a presentation of participation that does indeed go beyond the human but without leaving the body behind, and with the 44 Pseudo-Dionysius, p. 74.

Marsyas, after all, is more physical ? all quivering sensuality ? after his flaying than before; he represents an art that speaks through physical suffering and does not transcend the body completely. Dante, unlike St Paul, who was unsure whether he was in or out of the body in Acts 9. 15, is truly in the body throughout the poem, albeit one 'transhuman ized'. And he emphasizes both the importance of the body as a mode of knowl edge and the increase of blessedness after the general resurrection, making the theologians in the sphere of the sun give a deafening shout of Amen' as they anticipate reunion with their resurrected bodies.49 It is the fact that Dante expe riences Paradise in the body that brings grotesque features into the poem, but with them also a certain dynamism and reality effect. His earthly perspective allows even St Peter himself, in Paradiso 27, to vent his anger on the state of the church on earth by turning red, all the blest blushing with him.50 The presence of Dante's earthly body entails moments of baulked vision, of blindness, in which his understanding and capacity fail, but the awareness of limitation only serves to precipitate a deeper vision. The marker of Dante's grotesque physical ity acts like a bow that draws back only to fling him further forward.51 The grotesque smile, furthermore, acts as an exemplum of analogy itself: that is, the mode by which the created human participates in the divine. Analogy is the awareness of difference ? created from Creator?and the acknowledgement that even the seemingly human form of the smile belongs primarily to God and only by analogy to us.52 Nicholas of Cusa, a century later, argued that the face itself belongs primarily to God, who is 'the absolute form, which is the face of faces'.53 Our contracted face, subject to quantity, to space and time, can see but itself in God. To see God's smile then, is both to acknowledge one's limited perception of the divine countenance, but also to witness to the 'secret and hidden silence' behind the face, of which the smile is both veil and disclosure.54 And not only does Dante have recourse to smiling circles to convey the veiled and disclosed nature of God as Trinity, but he also conflates two quite different modes of representing the Trinity iconographically. In medieval art one finds, on the one hand, sophisticated abstract and enigmatic symbols such as intertwined Borromean rings or fishes, and, on the other, the anthropomorphic 49 Paradiso, 14. 62, pp. 156-7. 50 Paradiso, 27. 19-21, pp. 302-3. 51 The bow analogy is used by Beatrice herself in Paradiso 1. 119 to describe the movement of the blessed souls across the sea of being towards their tebs in the Divine order. 52 On analogy see Aquinas, Summa, ia, q. 4, art. 3, in 1 (1911), pp. 49-51. 53 Nicholas of Gusa, On the Vision of God, in Selected Spiritual Writings, trans, and ed. by H. Lawrence Bond, Classics of Western Spirituality (New York: Paulist Press, 1997), p. 243. Interestingly, this essay was written for Benedictine monks at Tegernsee, to accompany meditation on the icon of the holy face of Christ. Dante, too, probably intends an icon-like face of Christ to be the 'nostra effige' of Paradiso 33. 131, to follow the analogy of I Corinthians 13. 12: 'Videmus nunc per speculum in aenigmate, tunc autem facie ad faciem' (Vulgate); 'now we see in a glass darkly, but then face to face' (King James Authorized Version). 54 Nicholas of Cusa, p. 244.</page><page sequence="13">ALISON MILBANK 167 Trinity ? the so-called 'Throne of Mercy' ? of an aged Patriarchal Father holding the cross from which Christ hangs, with the Spirit as a dove between or above, or a triad of three men.55 In glimpsing a human visage in among the circlings, Dante is conflating the two traditions, with a somewhat grotesque, hybrid result. This is in accord, however, with his earlier presentation of Christ in the Pageant in the Terrestial Paradise in the form of a gryphon, a mythological creature that is half lion, half eagle. Dante is emphasizing the double nature of Christ as both fully human and fully divine, and does so also by means of colour: 'he had his members of gold so far as he was bird, | and the rest was white mixed with red'.56 After his confession and baptismal crossing of the stream to join Beatrice, Dante views the gryphon through her eyes, and the creature's colour changes and with it his nature. As an orthodox believer, Dante does not believe that Christ really changes from one to the other nature, but that is how he sees it 'through a glass darkly', and thus in a monstrous or hybrid form.57 As Singleton points out in his notes, this scene is the pendant for that final vision 'face to face', but although we are given to think that Dante, following the prayers of Bernard and the Virgin herself, does have a taste of '1 sommo piacer' ('highest pleasure'), it is still a partial and grotesque vision of the divine humanity, which fails to understand how each nature might relate to the other.58 Dante will, however, learn how the two natures of Christ cohere in his own person. He ends the poem by joining the Divine circling, as his desire and will are revolved like a wheel by the Love which moves the Sun and the other stars'.59 His is now a hybrid and double existence, both human and yet also participating in the Divine. . 'Propria penne' ('his own wings') fail to penetrate the mystery of how this is possible, but the image itself brings back memories of the winged gryphon Christ, whose pennons stretch so high that they are lost to sight. Even in his limited bodily humanity, Dante can image the duality of Christ as an actual grotesque.60 55 On the triad of men see Adelheid Heimann, 'Trinitas Creator Mundi', Journal of the Warburg Institute, 2 (1938), 42-52.

The beautiful is divine in disclosing the Real, and in calling it towards itself. It is energy and movement, not repose, and it embraces the seemingly ugly and monstrous. Even the grotesque Narcissus, Satan, can be a wonder ? monster being etymologically linked to monstrare, 'to show' ? a marvel of the power and justice of God, despite his own perverted will.61 And Christ himself, as Augustine pointed out, was made ugly for us by being 'deformed' by his sufferings on the cross, but this deformation was the means by which the whole of humanity could be beautified.62 Thought of Christologically in this way, beauty for Dante is not disinterested but ecstatic love that smiles: 'like a light it flashes onto everything the beauty ? causing importations of its own well-spring ray', as Dionysius puts it. 'Beauty "bids" all things to itself Hence in the Gothic cathedral everything and everyone can have a smile: monsters and marmosets, dogs and angels, as a marker of God's otherness but our participation in the Divine, just as the blessed in Dante's paradise has each his or her own particular smile. In a culture such as ours, for which the harmo nious conception of the beautiful has lost all resonance, and for which the grotesque is often no more than a mode of demystification, Dante offers us a way back, through an embrace of the positive grotesque, to a dynamic under standing of desire for the beautiful glimpsed through the grotesque in which we can all, beautiful and ugly alike, equally participate. 61 On monsters as wonders see Caroline Walker Bynum, 'Wonder', American Historical Review, 102 (1997), 1?17 (p. 8), and Ruskin's discussion of griffins in Modern Painters, vol. 3, pp. 141?7. 62 Augustine, Sermo XXVII, cited in Astell, p. 51.</page></plain_text>
