Obviously, this big book is an event : here is Klingner's mature judgment of Virgil. It is not, however, a work of synthesis, a synoptic view of Virgil's development and total achievement such as some of Klingner's earlier ar ticles had seemed to foreshadow. Nor does it deal (save in various details) with the past or present literature of the subject. Rather it presents, as Klingner declares in his preface, the results of a life-time's preoccupation with Virgil's works and gives us the many separate observations ? espe cially the discoveries, the new things yet unnoticed ? that he has made over the years. Some of these have already been published and are here re printed : his famous article on the first eclogue, for example, and the whole of his recent book on the 'Georgics5. Most of the section on the 'Eclogues5, however, and the whole 'Aeneid5 section (231 pages) are new or some 377 (new) as opposed to 220 (reprinted) pages of text. One can perhaps debate the justification of the reprints : for future Virgilians, however, it is a dis tinct advantage to have all Klingner's views on all three Virgilian works in one compact volume. I personally regret, nevertheless, that we do not have the synoptic work, the exposition of the 'Einheit5 of Virgil's uvre or of his full development, which Klingner was so well equipped to give us. But we must be thankful for what we do have, a storehouse of aper?us and in sights, shrewd analyses, novel yet convincing observations, a wonderful cross between essay and commentary, exegesis and criticism. In this review I shall comment only on the pages (367-597) devoted to the 'Aeneid5 and then make some attempt to sum up Klingner's main contribution to our knowledge of Virgil. The section on the 'Georgics5 has already been re viewed.1 The section on the 'Bucolics5 needs far more space than I can spare. It is full of interest and the chapters on Eclogues 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 are new. I may later be able to discuss them in another place. Here I prefer to do justice to the heart and the really original portion of K.'s book: that on the 'Aeneid5. Even so this review is over-long. But I have not been able to discuss K. without, as it were, following him step by step, especially since his book is not an architectonic unity or the development of a single thesis or method, but a host of often disparate and unrelated observations. Furthermore he deserves such attention; let this review be considered, in part, as a tribute to one of the greatest Latinists of our time. The section on the 'Aeneid5, like that on the 'Bucolics5, consists of se parate and only loosely related chapters on each of the 12 books. Again the reader is left to infer the 'unity5 of the whole. Nor, again, is there any 'placing5 of the Aeneid in the total picture of Virgil's development or uvre. But this section is assuredly the most interesting one of the book because it is the only one that is wholly new. K. here makes, in fact, a con siderable number of original observations and gives us what is, in large part, his own picture of the Aeneid. There is much he does not say; many 1 Cf. this journal 36, 1964, 670-679.</page><page sequence="2">B. Otis: Klingner, Virgil 555 points he passes by. But there is also an ample reward for the careful reader; K. here takes his place with the great elucidators or critics of the poem. Above all he often introduces literary-criticism into areas heretofore reserved only for scholarship. It is indeed just because his scholarship is so assured that he can venture so easily beyond it. There is an initial section on the Roman Epic (pp. 367-382). Here he treats V.'s Roman epic predecessors, especially Naevius and Ennius. By starting from them rather than from the traditional comparison with Homer, he feels it possible to get a clearer sense of V.'s dependence and ori ginality. I think that this approach is fruitful (I have used it myself) but I am also a little uneasy about it. There is a danger that V.'s true relation to Homer will be underrated and perhaps misconceived. Knauer, I think, has done all Virgilians a service by concentrating simply on the Homeric side of the Aeneid, on the truly huge amount of Homer in it ; in this way the importance of V.'s return to Homer is brought out, the fact that in a sense V. did not so much imitate as deliberately reproduce huge sections of Odyssey and Iliad. Whatever his use of Naevius or Ennius or others, it was his use of Homer that is primary and paramount. It is this that in fact distinguishes him from Naevius, Ennius, etc. and constitutes a large part of his originality. K. is in general quite aware of this fact but does not I think give nearly enough weight to it. V. was both following and reacting against his epic predecessors. He was certainly influenced (even though we cannot be sure of the precise extent of the influence) by Naevius' Bellum Punicum (probably in its introduction or Proem1). But of course, as K. sees, Naevius himself was here influenced by Homer (the storm, etc.). In some sense then both Homer-pure and Naevius-Homer influenced V. (not to mention Apollonius, Catul lus and others). Nevertheless it remains true that Aeneid 1-6 is, in a very real sense, an integral reproduction of Odyssey 5-11 (storm through nekuia). The Aenean legend, in other words, is put in an Odyssean mould. Speculation as to Naevius, Ennius, etc. should never lead us to miss or minimize this all-important fact. K. rightly stresses the new importance of history (even contemporary history) in the Roman Epics of Naevius, Ennius, etc. Here Romans gave a special twist to a Hellenistic genre and raised it to a prominence and a value it had never yet achieved. Yet K. realizes that the Homeric element in pre-Virgilian historical epic is nonetheless quite extrinsic (nur ?u?erlich). The Homeric elements are simply added or prefaced to the Roman histo rical content. Though V., as K. thinks (here I cannot agree: see my book), in effect pro mised the purely historical sort of Roman epic in the proem to Georgics III (i. e. a Bellum Actiacum), he in fact quite relinquished any such outmoded form of epic. The Aeneid is not historical in this sense. It is, like Homer, saga or legend of the heroic, homeric age. The actual Roman and Augustan history is introduced only indirectly, as the distant end or goal of a story centuries removed from it. All this, as K. rightly says, was absolutely new. Nor were V.'s epic followers concerned to follow his example. Valerius Flaccus and Statius reverted to purely mythological (non-Roman) topics: Silius Italicus and Lucan, 1 Klingner rightly (in my view) rejects the argument of L. Strzelecki (accepted by Buchheit in CV. ?ber die Sendung Roms' 1963) that the Aeneas-saga was inserted by Naevius into his description of the campaign of 263/2 and thus was not used as part of the poem's proem or introduction. An insertion' or digression of two books or so is improbable in the extreme and rests only on Charisius' attribution of fragment 32 to the first book.</page><page sequence="3">556 B. Otis: Klingner, Virgil to purely historical ones. And Lucan, in his epic of the civil wars, was quite deliberately repudiating the Virgilian glorification (or Homerization) of the past: the Bellum Civile is the designed antithesis of the Aeneid. All this is very well put. None the less it does not seem to me that K. quite realizes that V. did much more than de-historicize (so to speak) the Ennian-Naevian epic. For as we have just seen, he not only adopted the Aenean legend as his main subject: he also fitted it into an explicitly Homeric plot (Od. 5-11 and large sections of the Iliad). It is the de signed, continuous correspondence of Homeric motif with Roman motif, of Homeric with Roman ethos, that constitutes a pivotal element in the Aeneid's appeal and effect. I greatly admire K.'s discussion of the verbal echoing of Ennius by Virgil (pp. 373-374). No one has analyzed so finely the way in which V. has softened the verse (by e. g. the alternation of differently arranged and accented word-groups) and yet reproduced the energy and weight of Ennius. As to his speculations on Naevius (he argues for a Naevian 'courtship' of Aeneas by Dido, though he thinks this is political rather than erotic) I can register interest rather than conviction. Also I think that the Naevian influence can be (and is here by K.) overdone. Granted that V. did, after Naevius, want to bring out the 'origin* of the Punic war - the historical bearing of the halt in Carthage - the main thing is not the Punic War but the temptation, fall and disengagement of the hero, - the choice between love and Roman pietas, the motivation of Roman Aeneas. Here it is the Homeric, perhaps even more the Apollonian (Medea) model which counts. The Aeneid without Dido's eros would be a very different poem. 1. K.'s chapters on the different books are of quite uneven length: the longest ones are on Book 1 (27 pages); Book 4 (30 pages) and Book 7 (30 pages); the shortest on Books 2 (10 pages), 11 and 12. His account of 1 is in effect a running commentary with special attention paid to the Homeric parallels. He stresses the uniqueness of the opening lines, - the indication of the poem's teleological character in the primus of the first line, the combination of Od. 1, 1 (the man and the muse) with the opening of the little Iliad: 'I sing of Ilion and Dardania5 (where the muse is not mentioned). The invocation of the muse in Virgil comes later (1, 8). Thus V. secures a new, more intense movement : musa mihi causas memora up to the emotional query, tantaene animis caelestibus irae ? (indebted to but yet quite different from the question of Iliad 1, 8, what god, etc. ?). There is here, as K. acutely shows, a quite new kind of lyrical, subjective, feeling (a ?lyrisierender Einschlag?) indicated by a new climactic use of anaphora, cola and pauses. It is this kind of analysis at which K. is specially good. On the other hand, he does not really attempt to describe the structural elements of the storm episode (e. g. the antithetical arrangement of storm/calm, Juno/Venus, Aeolus/Neptune, Aeneas' two speeches, etc.) though he rightly points to V.'s emphasis on the gods, as opposed to Homer's on the man, Odysseus (The Trojans only emerge in 157: Defessi Aeneadae, etc. ?Es ist, als ob Troer nur dazu gerettet seien, um ihr Elend recht zu f?hlen!?, p. 388). What K. stresses is the contrast of misery and oppression with life or vitality in the whole scene. His analysis of the famous second speech of Aeneas (198 ff Osoc ii, etc.) points to its sub jective, inner movement (by contrast with its Odyssean models) and its elevation of mere tXy][jloct?v7) into confidence in the gods and the mission they impose. (He is surely not, as he suggests, the first to mention a pos sible reference to Horace's Plancus ode.)</page><page sequence="4">B. Otis: Klingner, Virgil 557 But I cannot possibly reproduce much of the remarkable verbal analysis that so often gets closer to the nerve of the poetry than that of any previous commentator. My only real reservation here concerns K.'s willingness to accept the contrasts and tensions as if they were all a necessary part of the 'Virgilian harmony5. Why is Aeneas so confident in I98f, so woe-begone and despondent in 94f ? Why the mysterious succession of storm by calm, Aeolus by Neptune, Juno by Venus ? K. does not answer except by the vaguest of hints. I have expressed at some length my own view that the first 304 lines of 1 are in effect a symbolic prelude to the 'Odyssean5 (Bks. 1-6) Aeneid. The gap or distance between the Venus of the scene in heaven (223 f) and the Venus that meets Aeneas (305 f) is thus, as I see it, deli berate. (K., p. 396, leaves the matter in doubt and makes little of the mission of Mercury in 392-4. It seems to me that V. is above all concerned to discriminate between Jupiter (his actions, prophecies, etc.) and the Venus of the main narrative (the Venus who meets Aeneas). The 'storm5 in this sense is a 'preview5 of the storm at the cave in Bk. 4, after which Mercury does in fact represent and enact the will of Jupiter as opposed to the machinations of both Venus and Juno. The gods therefore domi nate 11. 1-304 as they emphatically do not dominate the subsequent nar rative.) K. does not, I think, add materially to what others have said about the encounter of Aeneas with the disguised Venus. The differences from Ho mer are striking but obvious. But K.'s pages (307-401) on the next episode (Aeneas at the Juno temple) are admirable : he brings out trenchantly the new humanitas, the Menschlichkeit of the scene. Aeneas sees the temple sculptures in the context of his own inner experience: this, as K. says, is radically unhomeric and also ungreek. It is not that Aeneas simply sees traces of other human beings (such as geometrical figures in the sand by a shipwrecked survivor) but that he encounters their sympathy, their fellow feeling, their tears (sunt lacrimae rerum). And the tears are, in the last analysis, Dido's : his viewing of the last of the temple sculptures (The Amazon Penthesilea) immediately precedes the entrance of Dido. But K. does not in my view quite grasp the point of the Dido-Artemis simile. He refers only to the Odyssey and the application of the simile there to Nau sikaa. But Apollonius also used the simile of Medea (Arg. 3). And this is significant because V. clearly intended the parallelism of the Diana Dido simile with the Apollo-Aeneas simile (where hunting is also empha sized) that appears later on at the start of the hunt in Bk. 4. This latter simile moreover is clearly Apollonian in origin (Jason compared to Apollo, in Arg. 1). The shift from virgin huntress to male hunter (the shift also in emphasis from Dido to Aeneas) is all part of a motif-complex in which the contrasted similes play a major r?le and in particular the similes modeled on the Medea-Jason similes of the 'Argonautica5. K. does not, it seems to me, grasp the vital importance of the Argonautica here, - the remarkable way in which V. has combined it with the Odyssey and, at some points, with the Iliad also.</page><page sequence="5">558 B. Otis: Klingner, Virgil We see this also and particularly in his treatment (pp. 405-407) of the divine motivation of the love-affair (especially Venus and Cupid). Clearly V. is combining Homer with Apollonius (the activity of Hermes-Mercury with the activity of Venus-Cupid) to which later on (Bk. 4) the activity of Juno is added (it had already been anticipated in the storm that brings Aeneas to Carthage). The combination seems to K. unsatisfactory or de ficient though he admirably describes how the pseudo-Ascanius 'draws off5, so to speak, Dido's lower or physical emotions while leaving the higher or spiritual influence to Aeneas, his heroic words and reputation (p. 405). But what K. seems to me to miss is the 'correlation5 of divine and human action in the episode. It is obvious that the love-affair needs no divine moti vation and in fact Venus and Cupid hold their hands until Aeneas and Dido have been prepared for each other, have met, have recognized the marvelous reciprocity of the encounter (though Dido much more so than Aeneas). That the 'sub-fates5 or subordinate deities (i. e., subordinate to Jupiter) should now intervene is, it seems to me, part of the whole scheme of correlation in the poem : that great events on a human level should be also great events on a divine; and that the central Roman purpose for which Jupiter stands should be discriminated from all temporary oppo sition to it, even though the opposition is of course essential to the story. I am not sure that V.'s divine machinery here is particularly happy or convincing : it is nonetheless so correlated with the human action that the latter is magnified rather than diminished or evacuated. There is nothing of the almost facetious mythology with which Apollonius begins Arg. 3. We may cavil at the device of the pseudo-Ascanius but it at least preserves the human character of the amour \ there is no winged Eros, no arrow, no shooting or wounding with the arrow. The literally conceived Cupid arrow-wound of Apollonius is in V. a quite psychological or non-literal one, and is primarily conveyed by the impressive simile of the wounded doe: the wounder here is clearly Aeneas, not Cupid and the wound is in the simile, not in the actual flesh of Dido. K.'s comparison of the reception banquets of Alcinous and Dido is very well done. Dido is no Nausikaa, no Calypso, no Medea or Euripidean amoureuse. She has as K. so admirably sums it up ?ein Dasein, das Ge schichte hat?. Her tragedy is her decline from queenly nobility and gene rosity (exhibited here in her splendid hospitality) to destructive emotion and agony. This is at once an historical and a tragic event. 2. On Bk. 2 K. is brief (10 pages). There is of course no necessity to treat everything at equal length but I am not sure but that K.'s brevity here reflects a certain underestimation of this pivotal book. His great error in my view is to consider it entirely from the stand point of the Laocoon problem, by first recalling the famous Streitfrage as to V.'s relation to Quintus Smyrnaeus and Tryphiodorus : are they dependent on V. or do they reflect instead the sources of V. ? K. does not attempt to 're-beat* this 'dead horseJ but he does see in the ^liupersis* (attributed to Arctinus) a clue to V.'s intention. In Arctinus, as K. thinks, the snake prodigy causes and immediately precedes the flight of Aeneas. But of course V.'s Aeneas cannot, for both Trojan and Roman reasons, as either a hero or a man of pietas, act in quite that way. Yet the Aeneas who tells the tale to Dido did realize the</page><page sequence="6">B. Otis: Klingner, Virgil 559 significance of the snake-prodigy; i. e., that it meant the divinely decreed doom of Troy. This, to K., is the ?Grundthema? of the book, the union of the hero's with the gods' will, his submission to their design. K. distinguishes three phrases of the story: the &lt;we&gt; narrative of the first 267 lines (Aeneas here only one of the bewildered Trojans); the CP narrative (or partial T' narra tive) of 11. 268-633 (Aeneas finally brought to see the ??bermacht? of the gods); and the decision to withdraw of the final lines (634-804) wherein the gods by their omens over come the resistance of Anchises. It is for this reason that K., among other things, rejects the 22 verses (567-588) that Servius records as being tibicines or temporary inserts in V.'s MS that, for this reason, Varius and Tueca omitted to publish. The Helen episode (A.'s temporary design to check the Greeks by killing her) conflicts, according to K., with the general theme of the book; i. e., the submission of Aeneas to the gods. I cannot at all agree with K. on this line of reasoning. The gods of course intend the destruction of Troy as they also intend the founding of Rome (and so Aeneas' escape). The Laocoon episode forebodes the former (we need not here argue whether it is or is not a proper prodigium); the final omens (flame, comet) point to the latter. The problem as I see it (and I have tried to show at some length) is to get Aeneas to accept the former (and so try to save his family) and to get Aeneas, Anchises, and all the other prospective Tro jan-Romans to accept the latter (which though foreshadowed by the Hector-dream and Panthus is quite strange and alien to both Aeneas and Anchises). But in the last analysis it is only the promise of Rome (not the threatened destruction of Troy) which counts: Aeneas is forced by events and by his mother's revelation of the destroying gods at work to return to his family but Anchises' refusal to leave renders this return quite nugatory. Everything finally hinges on the sign that Jupiter sends. Only on these terms, as I see it, could a true hero possibly survive his patria. On this interpretation, it is Rome that counts as it gradually asserts itself over Troy. Aeneas' problem is not so much to obey the gods engaged in the destruction of Troy as to overcome his own fury and despair, first in the interest of his family, second in the in terest of Jupiter's Roman purpose as interpreted and adopted by his father. What Venus does is to emphasize his absolute impotence, his inability to do anything but go home. From this standpoint his prior rage at Helen seems to me supremely apposite: it is the last flareup of despair, defeated furor. It is the crisis that necessitates the appearance of Venus who indeed points out, in the indisputably genuine text, that it is not Helen (or the dead Paris) but the gods who are to blame for Troy's destruction. By putting all his emphasis on the Laocoon theme (the destruction of Troy) K. it seems to me has missed its true relevance to the whole story. Aeneas has no piety toward, no interest in the destroy ing gods save only so far as they reveal his own impotence. Venus only wants to show him that and get him home: Jupiter will take care of his actual withdrawal. I cannot here reargue the question of 2, 567-588. There is a lacuna after 566; Venus does refute A.'s implied charge against Helen; obviously some factor, beyond the mere death of Priam, must be responsible for her appearance ; the Servius vita gives us at least a very plausible account of the lines' omission from the main text. V. may very likely have noted their discrepancy (for so it seems to me to be) with the Deiphobus narrative of 6 and thus set them aside for his final harmonization of discrepant elements in the poem. Against such arguments, of what force is K.'s insistance on a 'general theme* that in fact belies the true emphasis of the book ? Put another way: K. does not show any appreciation of the r?le of Anchises in this (second) book. Anchises is not in the least deflected by Laocoon or his fate or even by the destruction of Troy: his problem is to find a reason for surviving it, a reason that no amount of revelation of the gods' hostility can over come, - indeed such revelation can only enhance it. And it is on Anchises' decision ? only on his decision - that Aeneas' action depends. 3. This relative neglect of Anchises is also my major criticism of K.'s chapter on the third Aeneid. Otherwise he reveals a remarkable sensitivity to the atmosphere and nuances of this often neglected book. His account of A.'s uncertainty, lostness or homelessness and of the piety that overcomes it, is (save for the strange deemphasis of Anchises) perhaps the best thing that has been written on this theme. There is no Odyssean lust for adventure</page><page sequence="7">56o B. Otis: Klingner, Virgil but the picture of a ?Dasein, das im Bodenlosen schwebt?. All the traditions of A.'s temple and city foundings are sacrified to the drawing of this picture. K. devotes much space to the Helenus prophecy. He acutely describes its alternation of encouraging and discouraging elements, its avowed ambiguity and ellipsis, its ominous reference to Juno. It is meant to be a riddle. K.'s discussion of the difference between V.'s and Homer's Polyphemus is also enlightening: the adaptation of Odysseus' wild adventure to the decorum and the pathos of Aeneas. 4. K.'s chapter on the fourth book is his longest (30 pages) and, though it says little that is startlingly new, reveals in every sentence the sort of literary-criticism with which K. so strikingly transforms the older or technical-scholarly approach of Heinze. K. starts with Heinze's analysis of the twofold character of the fourth Aeneid: the Hellenistic amour (Me dea, Ariadne, etc.) combined with the elevated style and drama of tragedy. Whatever the truth in Heinze's analysis, it is determined far too exclusively by 'technical5 considerations. Heinze disregards all that exceeds his theory of an erotic little epos changed to dramatic intensity by the use of Tragedy. For one thing the connection of Books 1 and 4 is lost, the influence of Naevius (Dido the Carthaginian queen) is not understood and therefore also the historical character (i. e., its relation to Roman history and to the whole divine plan for Rome and Carthage) and meaning of the episode is neglected. K., rightly in my view, stresses the tension between Dido's pas sion, her human suffering, her tragedy and the high, suprapersonal plann ing and morality of the gods. Two worlds, two motives, two principles (Weltleid und Hoffnung, Weltleid und Weltfr?mmigkeit) are in conflict just as they were also in the Georgics. I would here make the reservation that I think K. is altogether too vague as well as too optimistic about the 'harmony5 in which he sees the conflict end (p. 441). Surely the tragedy of Dido is not resolved or humanized and Aeneas realizes this when he reen counters her in the underworld. K. is quite admirable on V.'s conception o? pudor. Basically it is fear or awe before the gods. The book in this sense is almost sternly moral. Dido knows that her furtive love is as wrong as her false coniugium. But neither she nor Aeneas will quite admit or take moral cognizance of what happens. The hunt is seen from without, not from within the human characters; the marriage is only indirectly described ; the period of sexual enjoyment is passed over in silence. But to say that this is due mainly to the 'high' style of epic or the epic tradition (as K. seems to think) seems to me superficial and really belies K.'s excel lent discussion o? pudor. Of course Virgil could not, like Catullus and the amatory ele gists, dwell on amatory pleasure per se but his reticence, here, is certainly weighted with moral judgment and feeling. The atmosphere of the amor is pervaded by guilt feelings: the pleasure is stifled at its very source. K. rightly and excellently insists on the difference between the speech of Dido (e. g. 305-330) and that of the Catullan Ariadne: the first shows psychological movement and follows the shifting instability of Dido's feelings : the latter is static and declamatory. It is this sort of characterization that distinguishes Virgil from the similar but so different love narrative of Apollonius, Catullus or Callimachus. Dido shows inner change and development, - a soul in motion, so to speak, as the Hellenistic and neoteric amoureuses do not. And so too with Aeneas, especially as he changes after Mercury's warning. But what of the famous recovery o? pietas by Aeneas ? Here I think K. hardly exhausts the full significance of the famous oak simile of 11. 441-446 and its particular context in the book. It does certainly express the sorrowful compulsion as well as the resolution of Aeneas. But a rather new light is thrown on it by the Dido of Book 6. She had (in this</page><page sequence="8">B. Otis: Klingner, Virgil 56* book, 4) demanded why Aeneas should flee her (men? fugis, etc.) and called him a rock (cautes) of the Caucasus, etc. while Aeneas (331) eyed her unmoved (monitis immota tenebat lumind). In 6 the tables are exactly turned. It is Aeneas who asks why she flees him (quem fugis? 466) while it is Dido who eyes him unmoved (fixos oculos tenebat) and becomes the very rock (Marpesia cautes) that she had once accused him of being. The echoes of 4 here are undeniable : this is why also the correspondence of the two similes of immobility (oak and rock) seems also intentional: the unmoved Aeneas of 4 is as it were compensated for by the unmoved Dido of 6. In both cases there is a tragic lack of communication but Aeneas in 4 nevertheless feels the bitterness as the Dido of 6 does not. The oak is shaken but unmoved : the rock is not to be shaken at all. To K. (p. 465) Aeneas cannot reveal his love or amatory emotion because the poetic convention forbade it. Though, unlike the Greek poets, Romans had shown men express ing such emotion in serious poetry (e. g., Catullus) they still could not do so in high epic. K. holds to this view even though he admits that Virgil, for all that, does acknowledge Aeneas' love and suffering (magnoque animum labefactus amore). This, it seems to me, is to take a rather narrow view of V.'s art. Aeneas is unmoved in his resolution but not unshaken: assailed and weakened but not uprooted. He represses his emotion but ob viously has it. But what can he offer Dido ? What use is it to say more than he does say ? The picture, it seems to me, is psychologically quite convincing. We do not have to draw on epic convention in order to explain it. I think this is shown by the reversal of positions in 6 (where now Aeneas pleads and Dido stands dumb) and reveals once more the hu manity of the man. It is precisely this humanity that he preserves as Dido does not. The oak is very different from the rock. Here again K. shows his fine feeling for special passages. His analysis of the harsh Ennian lines (397-407) in their contrast with the emotion-laden lines that immediately precede them, his remarks on the ant simile (404 f) etc. are sensitive and, in the best sense, novel. I find of course many omissions, many things untreated in this chapter, - above all perhaps its relation to the preceding books (especially 1) and its bearing on the later books (especially 6). But its essential insights seem to me both right and powerfully stated. 5. K.'s literary sensitivity to the somewhat enigmatic fifth book is keen and results in one of his most interesting chapters. Again he seems to me to stop short at some fundamental questions but what he does say is both admirable and true. He accepts without comment the strange deferral of the funeral games (to a year after Anchises' death) but dwells on the fact that the games were required by the Homeric or epic convention. But why were the games inserted here, in this Odyssean portion of the poem, rather than somewhere in the later or Iliadic half? And why not directly after Anchises' death and before Bk. 4 ? K. rightly argues for the unity of the book, the placing of the games within the ?Anchisesfest?, the relation of the arrow omen to the ship burning, Acestes and Acesta, the foreshadow ing of the 'nekuia5 by the scene at Anchises' grave, the constant mixture of festivity and danger, the parallelism of the initial and final Palinurus sce nes. What I miss, however, is any sense of Anchises' true importance. Surely V. must have planned the inclusion of the Dido book between the death (3) and the reappearance (5) of Anchises, must have intended the diversion of Aeneas' course back to Sicily and Anchises. Aeneas must be brought to full confrontation with Anchises in the underworld before the landing in Latium. The ship-burning changes what looks like a funeral ceremony into a crisis of confidence (Aeneas fatorum oblitus), a concen tration of forces for the coming war, and, above all, the decisive reencounter with Anchises. K. is very sensitive to the mood, the emotional correspon 36 Gnomon 1969</page><page sequence="9">562 B. Otis: Klingner, Virgil dences and contrasts of this book : he seems almost to overlook its position in the plot, its significance for the whole narrative, and for Aeneas' psy chology. In his lengthy (473-8) discussion of the fist fight (Entellus-Dares) he is at his very best. Rightly does he insist on the amazing difference here between V. and Homer (Epeios Euryalus fight in II. 23). V.'s fight turns on the inner or psychological change in the old hero, Entellus. But the most striking thing in K.'s discussion here is his demonstration of how the hexameters (of the fight passage) are structured : the correspondence of the strong rhythms with the content, above all the reworking of Catullus and Lucretius into a quite new effect, a quite new salience of initial verb, metrical pause, adverb, etc. Virgil builds to the kind of climax he wants, while conforming sense to sound and rhythm, above all by following through an emotional development. K. here brings us very close to the actual poetry : he shows precisely what V. did to Catullus and Lucretius and what effect he thereby achieved. 6. K.'s treatment of the sixth book (pp. 480-496 or 17 pages) is slighter than that of Books 1, 4, 7 or 9. Nor does he add anything that is parti cularly new though he treats the chief problems (or some of them) with discrimination and (in my view) sound judgment. He is good on the poe tical and atmospheric unity that V. has made out of his disparate materials (Cumaean Sibyll, Avernus-landscape, Odyssey 11, Misenus legend, re incarnation theory, etc.) though again I note the tendency to vague rather than sharp resolution of aporiae. I like his summary of the movement of the book (p. 482): 'thus do the prophecies build up from the frightening words of the Sibyl to the strengthening words of Anchises, from what is near at hand to what is far away, from the personal to the impersonal, from the confined to the open, from the dark and opaque to the light of clarity.5 He shows once more and very forcibly the unhomeric quality of the Roman ending. On the question of how and why V. has combined the mythological-Homeric with the philosophical-Roman elements of the book, he not only insists (properly) on the obvious suitability of incar nation-theory to the Roman prophecy but stresses more interestingly the designed contrast of two kinds of feeling or emotion : the pathos and sad ness, the pain, of the Homeric shades and the high, prophetic blessedness of the Roman heroes to come. The reincarnation-theory is not, to YL.,just a device for getting the Roman history into the heroic age but also a way of harmonizing the two worlds of V.'s 'nekuia5 by including them in a uni versal divine plan (in einer allumfassenden Vorsehung). (He notes here the parallel of the revelation in the 'Somnium Scipionis5.) I do not think, however, that K. emphasizes sufficiently the distinction of past and future or that between Aeneas' former life and Rome : he certainly, as before, pays quite insufficient attention to Anchises. The dreary environment of Dido and Deiphobus, their fixity in a tragic past, the agony and sorrow of Aeneas' reencounter with them, all seem to me express (whatever else they may express) the sad weight of the past and its hold on Aeneas. To this, the bright future, the resplendent goal is fittingly opposed in a proportionately exalted and sober conception of the after-life. Anchises is the indis pensable link between Aeneas and Rome or rather that which makes the future bearable as well as personally available to Aeneas. I find K.'s excursus on the Daedalus-sculptures of the Apollo-temple at Cumae (11. 14 f) very interesting. He seems to accept P?schl's Symbolic* explanation of them, as he</page><page sequence="10">B. Otis: Klingner, Virgil 563 also sees significance in the book's opening with a lament for Icarus, closing with one for Marcellus. Here again he properly rejects or minimizes the purely technical explanation (i. e., as a mere retardation-effect) of Heinze, just as he did before in his discussion of Heinze's rather mechanical theories of source-contamination. Again K. sees with new spectacles: the literary-critic does not replace but rather transmutes and completes the mere scholar. K. does not minimize the greatness of Heinze but simply recognizes the limitation of his perspective (really the perspective of classical scholarship sixty years ago). 7. K.'s treatment of Bk. 7 is especially interesting. It contains a clear reminiscence of Apollonius, Argonautica (3, 1 the invocation of the muse, Erato) but not where we should expect it in the first line or second but rather at 1. 37 or after the initial account of the voyage from Caieta and arrival at the Tiber mouth. This is because Virgil (unlike Apollonius who had al ready described the Argonauts' entrance of the Phasis mouth at the end of the preceding book [2]), combines the arrival with his new Latian theme that starts at 1. 37 (quae t?mpora rerum, quis Lati? antiguo fuer it status). Actually this passage (37 ff) suits history better than epic. But it is part of Virgil's purpose to begin with a bit of 'pre-history5. This is the pause or periphrasis in the narrative, so to speak, that is designed to precede and give historical depth to the events of the Trojan narrative that starts again at 1. 107. It is not foreshadowed in any Greek epic: it is thoroughly Vir gilian. K. shows also (and in I think a most convincing analysis) how V.'s ac count of the 'table-eating5 (107-147) diverges from the rather complex account in Dionysius (where the swine, the location of Aeneas' new city, etc. also appear), as well as from normal epic practise, in centering every thing on Aeneas: only he, not the multitude, recognizes the omen, makes the prayer and receives the confirming thunder of Jupiter. It is his pietas that is accented. Again in Ilioneus' embassy to Latinus, K. emphasizes the deliberate antiquity (the old Italian character) of the palace of Picus : this is, in K.'s view, a reminiscence of the old Regia of Rome, a pr?figuration of both the regia of Numa and the new House of Augustus. Virgil in short invests the whole scene (1-285) with a sense of Latium's antiquity and at the same time, of its readiness for Aeneas, and (prolepti cally) Augustus. The gods have prepared it for the externus, the divinely decreed stranger: he in turn shows his/???to, his response to the gods' de clared will. The departure from continuous narrative (the periphrasis or excursus of 11. 37-106) is part of his new, backward and forward looking, historical purpose. All this seems to me quite sound and sensitively explicated. But K., in my view at least, omits a crucial factor, - the designed parallel with all of Bk. 1. He only touches on this when he tries to explain how Latinus and Ilioneus could already know so much about each other. Their encounter he thinks is a deliberate reminiscence of the Dido-Ilioneus encounter at the Juno temple in Book 1 which does not quite fit its new setting. This may be (though it does not I think trouble any reader particularly) but I am rather astounded that K. should touch on this particular reminiscence of 1 while ignoring the much more important general parallelism between 36*</page><page sequence="11">564 B. Otis: Klingner, Virgil the two books. Surely the sequence : arrival (at Carthage or Latium) ; pre history (of Dido andLavinia) ; encounter (Dido-Ilioneus ; Latinus-Ilioneus) is designedly the same in both 7 and 1, as is, also, the sequence of the Allecto-Storm episodes: voyage to Italy or arrival in Latium; Juno's wrath ; use of Aeolus/Allecto. Indeed, not only the sequence but very many of the details correspond, though with, of course, a designed difference of both emphasis and result. In both the storm-civil-disturbance simile is used ; in both the doors of the Janus temple are closed or opened at the climactic moment, etc. To be sure Venus does not appear to counter Juno until Bk. 8 or, in other words, the arrangement of 7 is emphatically different. But of the general paral lelism there can surely be no doubt at all. The difference between the pre history or 'flashback5 episodes of Bks. 1 and 7 is that in the one case (1) it is a character (Venus) who tells the story to Aeneas: in the other (7) it is the author himself who tells it (expediam) along with a special appeal to Erato, the muse of amatory song. It is clearly indispensable to V.'s pur pose, that the reader should know the background or 'pre-history5 in both cases. But in 7 Aeneas does not need to know it or the narrative does not require that he know it, whereas it is quite necessary that he knows it in 1, for Venus' account of Dido really determines his whole approach to both Carthage and herself. In 7 it is enough that Latinus and Lavinia are ready for him: in any event we may assume that he has been somewhat prepared by Anchises, Helenus, etc. What the general parallelism shows, however, is the difference between the two situations : in the one case the ferocity of Juno is succeeded by a baneful and potentially fatal hospitality and a false conubium: in the other a beneficent hospitality, a divinely decreed conu bium is disrupted by the ferocity of Juno. The deliberate repetition or par allelism shows the climactic, intensified force - the vastly greater perversion of divine order ? that war in Latium and the new Iliadic Aeneid are to reveal. All this K. seems to ignore. K. says some good things about Allecto. He is I think right in his answer to the Streitfrage about Juno and the doors of the Janus temple: Allecto cannot open them because this hell-fury cannot possibly be left to settle the highest issues of state, to usurp the proper function of the king. The final responsibility is Juno's. It is in any event uncer tain (pace Norden) that Ennius' discordia* is really a true prototype of Allecto. I would only add that just as Venus in Bk. 1 was cheered by Jove's prophecy about the doors' closing, so Juno in this book would be the proper counterpart, or the reverse parallel to Venus there. The question has perhaps taken up more scholarly energy than it deserves. But is Allecto really as incongruous and malapropos as Macrobius and Heyne suppose ? K. rightly I think sees that V. wants what is ferocious, mad and hateful, wants to show how terrible are the forces that disrupt peace and civil peace at that (for the foedus, really the new civitas, of Trojans and Latins is almost an accomplished fact). He quite properly defends the Silvia-stag episode: V. needs a casus belli'that will not involve either side in deliberate violence but is, so to speak, the unintended result of rustic, primitive emotion. I would only add that the wanton perversion of primitive innocence (as here by Allecto) is a theme of the whole book and is especially evident in the muster of the Ita lians at the end. K. is very good on the muster. I cannot quite see why he is so doubtful (p. 518) about the reason for Camilla's final or 'honor-place' in the muster. She (as Lausus with Mezen</page><page sequence="12">B. Otis: Klingner, Virgil 565 tius at the beginning) is the innocent accomplice of Turnus. It is the perversion of inno cence with which V. both begins and ends the muster. The contrast of Camilla's myrtle staff (rightly does K. call it pastoral in distinction from the martial elements that precede it) with Turnus' shield and its Io emblem is surely also intended. The Io emblem, as K. admirably explains, shows the malice of Juno, of Juno against Jove. In, as it were, enlisting Camilla under Juno, Turnus is really vowing her to destruction. One must again mention the admirable analysis of specific passages, - here of II. 57-101 (the contrast of mood and feeling between the first 22 and second 21 verses of this passage: violence and confusion calmed by true prophecy). I would myself wish for more of this and perhaps less rechewing of the rather shopworn Streitfragen. But all the discussion of 7 is extremely stimulating. 8. K. approaches Bk. 8 with a highly developed sense of both its beauty and its diffi culties. There is the blend of Roman antiquity and Homer; the armor that lacks its Ho meric raison d'?tre; the elaborate excursus onCacus, etc. As he rightly points out, almost half the main narrative (102-368) is an elaborate development and transformation of a Homeric episode: Nestor's reception of Telemachus in Odyssey 3. K.'s careful compari son of this with Virgil brings out admirably the dramatic, emotional, historically oriented scene that Virgil has made out of the Homeric motifs. The reception of Aeneas by Pallas and Evander is a dramatic event, as the reception of Telemachus is not. (K. might have here referred more explicitly to what he certainly recognizes in fact: the 'subjective* or 'empathetic-sympathetic* character of V.'s style, - above all the effective use of historical presents). The speeches (Aeneas and Evander) are emotionally and climactically struc tured as those in Homer are not (I like especially K.'s analysis of the rising and falling verse-groups as indicators of musical articulation and emotional movement). Then the Hercules ceremony that Aeneas intrudes upon is no ordinary sacrificial meal like that in Homer. It is no expected theme (as Nestor with his satisfaction of Telemachus' curiosity) on which the analogously verbose Evander embarks. The ceremony is unusual: it marks a single, historical, saving act. The act (Hercules' killing of Cacus) is symbolic of the Ro man victory over violence and looks back to Saturn (the golden age) and ahead to Aeneas and Augustus. Then the setting is historic: this is primitive Rome (actually Pallanteum) but a Rome surrounded by ruins, prepared for a greater future. And it is an Arcadian, idyllic contrast to the clamor of Allecto and the war preparations of Bk. 7. Aeneas' very ignorance of what he finds, the very interruption of his anxious misson by the enforced interlude of the ceremony, the intrusion of the old legend into his present, all give the distance and depth required for the impact of history, the assimilation of the past into the present. On the events of the second day at Pallanteum (especially the omens and Aeneas' apparent grief before they come, - the hard thoughts that immediately precede them) K. seems to me quite convincing. The hard thoughts, the grief at the imminence of war, the possible losses that Evander's words suggest, give impact and salience to the omens, to the happy unexpectedness of the great sign. Aeneas' words of response to it are no lament for an enemy about to die, but triumph. (K. might here well have mentioned their intentional recall and reversal of A.'s initial storm-speech: O terque quaterque beati, etc.) On the parting of Evander and Pallas, K. points to its model in the Argonautica (parting of Jason and his father in Bk. 1) and thus to the difference, especially between the words of Evander and those of Jason's mother. Then the scene ends with the wonder ful Lucifer simile (which surely also preludes the death of Pallas : here the rising is the setting star) and the splendid noise of the close: quadrupedanteputrem, etc. On the shield, K. is somewhat less impressive though he makes the important points: here, as Becker and I have insisted, the assumption of the future, not its mere contem plation as in 6, is the important thing. K. is surely correct in seeing that the shield scene requires the earlier Pallanteum episode. Here as in the cPraise of Italy* in the Georgics, the glorification of peaceful rural Italy is united with Octavian and his Roman victories, the struggle between the good and bad powers is still at work. My only criticism of this remarkable chapter is once more of K.'s tendency to cgo vague* at the pivotal, articulating moments of his argument. Surely Aeneas is prefigured</page><page sequence="13">566 B. Otis: Klingner, Virgil by Hercules as he himself prefigures Augustus. All are 'divine men', men through their Roman beneficence deified (even Hercules is here romanized), men who defend and restore a peaceful 'golden age* Rome through their stalwart opposition to fratricidal and destructive violence. In a very real sense, the Cacus-story and the shield say the same thing, as does Aeneas when he receives the omens and accepts the challenge of Mezen tius and Turnus. Furthermore the whole book is the answer to 7: Venus here to Juno there; the calm Aeneas here to the raging Amata, Turnus, etc. there; the golden age peace and bliss of Pallanteum to the fury of Lavinium. K. righthly contrasts the peace and distance of this book to the furious involvement of violent men and women in 7. But he leaves the outlines very vague, vaguer I think than they actually are in Virgil himself. 9. On the whole I think K.'s most original and important contribution to our knowledge of the Aeneid is contained in his 23 page chapter on the ninth book. He has I think thrown more light than any previous critic on the structure of the battle scenes and, less directly, on the struc ture of Virgilian verse ?berhaupt. Virgil it is clear had a great problem when he came to the battles of the last 4 books. The Homeric battles were of course utterly outmoded: they were quite unavailable to any Roman engaged on a Roman military theme. Caesar's accounts of var ious individual episodes of combat were of course sporadic as well as unavailable to a poet. Ennius and his successors could not and did not write of battles in a Homeric way: that is quite clear from the fragments that survive; there are e. g. no chariots or chariot-contests. Not so with Virgil: he felt bound here as elsewhere to the Homeric model. In his brief references to the Trojan war in e. g. 6 and 1, there was no particular problem. But these were Trojans fighting Greeks in their homeland: it was different with the newly landed Trojans and the Latins. But there is no doubt that Virgil did in fact follow Homer in his battle scenes. The main difficulty was not so much one of his warriors' equipment or in any 'realistic5 detail (he certainly did not try to modernize) as in giving life and vitality to the thoroughly anachronistic conventions of Homeric war fare. He had among other things to show his heroes' character, to express their feelings and attitudes in his battle descriptions. He did this, as K. shows, by his arrangement of his verse in climactic patterns or groups of lines, each with its characteristic high-point or 'Ausklang5 but each sub ordinated to an equally climactic whole or unity of several verse-groups. K. analyzes for example the final battle exploit of Turnus that ends with his escape from the Trojan camp (659-818). Lines 659-690 have the function of inciting Turnus to take part in the battle: the temporary boldness of the Trojans, the opening of the gates by Pandarus and Bitias, the initial repulse of the Latins all lead up to the lines (691-2): Ductori Turno diversa in parte furenti turbantique viros p erf er tur nuntius, etc. Turnus then of course performs a series of aristeiai. These are climactically arranged: primum Antiphatem ? turn M er open, etc. and, as the pi?ce de r?sistence, Bitias. The latter's death is emphasized not merely by the unusual weapon {phalaricd) that Turnus uses against him but most of all by the impressiveness of his collapse which is enhanced by a simile (the</page><page sequence="14">B. Otis: Klingner, Virgil 567 collapse of a rock pier or pile) which concludes with a resounding ?Aus klang?: Inarime Iovis imperils imposta Typhoeo (716). With 1. 717 another climactic movement (but of greater intensity) begins : the killing of Pandarus (twice the length of that of Bitias) carries us through 1. 755. The battle is now more critical : seeing the turning of the battle against his side, Pandarus closes the gate without noting that Turnus is now within the walls ; Turnus is thus left as a tiger among the cattle ; the Tro jans are suddenly terror stricken, turbati subito Aeneadae. All this builds up the emphasis on Pandarus: turn Pandarus ingens (1. 735). His ex change of speeches with Turnus (737-42. 747-8) emphasizes his horrible death (his head is split in two) and leads up to the second 'Ausklang5 (755). Then (756-777) the killings are massed all to illustrate the furor and caedis insana cupido of Turnus (756-761). Lines 774?777 (that charac terize Clytius) form the climax that ends on another 'Ausklang5 (777). The very articulation and placing of the names and descriptions of the killed (now in two lines, now in four, followed by the climactic figures, Lynceus, Amycus, Clytius) mark the rising movement of the passage. The final section (Turnus' retreat: 778-818) is partially based on the retreat of Homer's Ajax in Iliad 16. But Virgil selects from the Homeric similes here the one that concerns a hero's withdrawal, the harassed lion simile, and he changes it to emphasize the emotions (ora, virtus) of Tur nus. The rallying speech of Mnestheus, the retreat of Turnus, the simile, the intervention of Juno, the unceasing pressure of the Trojans, again all lead to the final escape and the 'Ausklang5 (818): laetum sociis ab lu?a caede (Tiber) remisit. This, as K. rightly says, is quite unhomeric. The contents and killings are told in climactic passages (several lines with a clinching conclusion or 'Ausklang5) that follow the course of events, yet form together a total pattern of varied movement itself building to a final climax. After each such passage, another begins (the absence of connectives, the paragraph ing, usually marks it). In this style, similes very often form the 'Schlu? figur5, the clinching stop or conclusion. Even the speeches are assimi lated to the rhythmically rising periods of the narrative. All this is not only non-Homeric: it is also specifically Virgilian. No one, as K. points out (certainly not Ennius or the writers of 'Annales5 and contemporary 'Bella5) could have used the Homeric material with such amplitude or rebuilt it with such subtlety and skill. K. also shows the somewhat different movement of the ship metamorphosis (69-158) in comparison with the ship-burning of the Iliad and its interruption by the eagle omen (II. 12, 200 f). Turnus' attempt to burn the ships, the metamorphosis, his reaction and speech all express a psychology, a shift of feeling, a movement from checked furor to reckless fiducia, that foreshadows and also explains his later defeat at the end of the book. There is nothing of this in Hector's behavior at the ships. K.'s treatment of the Nisus-Euryalus episode is full of interest. Here too he goes beyond Heinze's 'technical5 appraisal, - the dramatic-emotive emphasis that Virgil gets by reshaping the 'Doloneia5. For, as he points out, Virgil has not, for technical reasons only, combined the r?le of the</page><page sequence="15">568 B. Otis: Klingner, Virgil unlucky Dolon with that of Odysseus and Diomedes. The story is one of tragic defeat and sacrificial friendship but it makes the devotion, even the eros, into a glory of Rome. It is thus certainly a 'counterweight5 to the aristeiai of Turnus. But I do not think that K. has here said any thing like the last word. V.'s unique glorification of the defeated friends does not, it seems to me, hide the futility and, what is more, the dangerous recklessness of their action. They, no more than Turnus, can take ad vantage of Aeneas' absence or prevent its disastrous effects. They, like Camilla later on, are betrayed by their excessive desire for plunder; Nisus also by his unreckoning desperate eros. They are not heroes like Aeneas. Yet I also think that V.'s very admiration for them, the obvious inten sity of this 'Liebesgedicht5 (as K. calls it, p. 565), betray a real problem of the poem. The friendship of Nisus and Euryalus, like that of Achilles and Patroclus, satisfies our dramatic sense, explains the action and achieves the high emotional emphasis that we expect at the climax of a great martial epic. This is not true of the friendship of Pallas and Aeneas. Aeneas is a champion, a victor, and his victory, unlike that of Achilles, is not bought by any actual or destined sacrifice of life. So the attempt to motivate him by his feeling for Pallas, thus to explain his ferocity in Bk. 10 and at the very end of the poem, cannot fully satisfy. But how could the Aeneid ever escape its essentially non-tragic character ? Yet the Nisus-Euryalus episode does show us what a tragedy V. might have written, could he ever have drawn Aeneas as a tragic hero. As it is, the attempt to combine the epic theme of tragic friendship (here Homer may even reflect the Gilgamish epic or one of its predecessors : it is perhaps the greatest single motif of the heroic age) with that of the triumph of the Restorer and Order-bringer, the Victor and Civilizer, was inevitably doomed to failure. But Euryalus is Virgil's version of a tragic Pallas; Nisus of a tragic Aeneas. And in another sense it is precisely Aeneas' superiority to Nisus (a superiority both moral and historical) that con stitutes his, Aeneas', fate. His eros could never achieve the satisfaction of complete self-sacrifice. He could never in this sense be fully human. 10. A large part of K.'s 16 pages on the tenth book (10 pages in fact) is devoted to the initial (11. 1-117) concilium deorum, the only such concilium in the Aeneid. Clearly this is reminiscent of such concilia in the Iliad (especially that in Bk. 8, but also that in Bk. 4) and almost certainly has some regard to a concilium or at least a divine conversation in the part of Ennius' Annales dealing with the second Punic War. Here K. discusses (in an excursus) the well-known attempt of Norden to recon struct Ennius' concilium on the basis of the fragments of Virgil and Lu cilius. He comes to a sceptical conclusion. Whatever the truth of Norden's theory, the Virgilian concilium stands on its own feet, or possesses its own poetic integrity. The Carthaginian references especially reinforce the logic and the impact of the pivotal speech of Venus in which she at least appears to abandon Aeneas, award the coming world empire to Juno and Carthage, and plead only for the safety of Ascanius.</page><page sequence="16">B. Otis: Klingner, Virgil 569 I think K. is quite right in his contention. Indeed it seems to me un necessary to have devoted so much attention to Norden, so relatively little to the meaning of the concilium. It is the only one in the whole poem. Why ? And what does the apparent resignation or surrender of Jupiter really mean ? As K. says, it was difficult for V. to combine the Homeric divine machinery with his (Stoic ?) conception of a fate that does not cancel, but ultimately achieves its own purpose through the individual plans and acts of contending mortals. But where herein lies the r?le of Jupiter? I find hard to accept, at least wholly, K.'s somewhat enigmatic conclusion, that V. differs from Homer in that V.'s Jupiter resigns fate (that which will and must happen) from his own anthropomorphic hands into the 'immanent order that controls the earthly actions of men5 (?in die immanente Gesetzm??igkeit der irdischen handelnden Menschen?). Is Jupiter then independent of Fate ? Does he in effect reverse the r?le that he has hitherto played in the whole poem as e. g. when he had un rolled the fates for Venus in Bk. 1, had sent the omens in 2, had dispatch ed Mercury in Bks. 1 and 4 and Anchises in 5 ? After having counter manded Juno so many times, was he now at last to wash his hands of her and Aeneas, letting things go their own way without further inter vention ? In short, when he declares (111 f) that each man's efforts (exorsa) will be allowed to achieve their own labor ana fortuna, while he remains impartial and lets the fates find their way, is he actually dissociating him self from fate and Aeneas' fate in particular ? K. does not really grapple with this problem. What we find, it seems to me, is a curious blend of Homeric levity and Stoic-Roman doctrine. This reflects, however, the peculiar character of this new 'moment5 or phase of the action. The pattern of Bks. 1 and 4 (intervention of Juno, distress and counter-intervention of Venus, final intervention of Jupiter) is in fact repeated in Bks. 7-10, though on a much grander scale. As I have indicated above, we can never hope to understand the second phase of the Aeneid without bearing in mind the constant reference back to the first. The main difference of Bks. 7-10 from Books 1 and 4 is the enlargement of scale and change (intensifica tion) of ethos. Thus Juno's intervention in 7 controls the whole book and is far more passionate and maleficent than in 1. So too the response of Venus in 8 is also given a whole book, ? for the omens and the arms are its two high points, both expressing Venus' direct concern with Aeneas' plight. Meanwhile, however, (Bk. 9) things look very black for Aeneas, though in fact it is clear that Turnus has been given his great chance (especially when Bitias and Pandarus opened the gates to him) and failed to exploit it. Aeneas, however, has not yet joined the battle: the moment of final decision therefore is now, when he is just about to appear with his new allies, in his new armor, on the actual field of combat. It is thus the moment for Jupiter to show his hand, just as he had shown it before in situations where Juno and Venus had already entered the scene and confused the divine plan for which he and Fate (or he as Fate) continued</page><page sequence="17">57o B. Otis: Klingner, Virgil to stand. So the new scale and the very intensity of the crisis require and justify the unique concilium. As to the fate or the divine plan, there is not now, as there has never been, any real doubt. Rome was destined to rule the world (thus destroy its great rival Carthage) as the Trojans were destined not to destroy but to form a political and social union with the Latins. Why then the impend ing war with them ? With Homeric levity (which is here outright sar casm) and in clear reminiscence of Zeus' proposal in Iliad 4 (to settle the Trojan war peacefully) Jupiter raises the question of Juno's (or Counter Fate's) relation to Fate, or the clearly outlined Roman destiny. He knows of course that Juno will not and cannot agree. His placitum laeti com ponite foedus (15) is sarcastic pretense: laeti indeed! Venus then, of course, points out the futility of all the past promises and events if Juno is now to have her way : cur nunc tua quisquam\vertere iussa potest aut cur nova condere fata? Why indeed! But Venus' despair (which I can not believe is quite as deep as it seems) and Juno's fury are wholly deter mined by the short-range considerations (here the battle of Bk. 9 and Aeneas' absence from it) with which they, as lesser divinities, as counter fates or sub-fates rather than fates, are alone concerned. But Jupiter knows the score: he knows that now it is only necessary to let Turnus and Aeneas fight it out to the inevitable conclusion which is the clear-cut victory of Aeneas, defeat of Turnus and established foedus or federated civitas of Trojans and Latins. It is neither any more necessary to prod Aeneas or to rescue him from purely external danger (such as the storm or the firing of his ships). It is time and high time to let him achieve his own victory, ? the victory which his own righteousness, valor and energy as well as his enemy's recklessness and hybris now in effect guarantee. That the declaration of Jupiter's apparent indifference is really one of the sub-fates' (esp. Juno's) impotence and ignorance becomes apparent when later on (606 f) he taunts Juno by ascribing to Venus the victory of Aeneas' fierce and hardy animus. Juno recognizes that she lacks the vis in amore that she desiderates: all she can now try to do is to save the victim. In other words, Jupiter's dissociation of himself from the fates is his way of reminding the sub-fates (Juno, Venus) that he does not now need to inter vene or act on their level. His victory and that of Aeneas are one, nor does he have to underline Aeneas' pietas or virtus by unnecessary help. Let Venus and Juno see for themselves ! Certainly K. is right in seeing here a curious blend of Homeric and philosophic conceptions but the scene is also intelligible in its own right: it is precisely the philosophic insight of this Jupiter that enables him to play with the short-range and wholly partizan emotions of Venus and Juno. What was needed above all at the crisis of the action was a decla ration that now at last Aeneas was about to achieve his own victory, prove his own pietas and worth. It seems to me that K. does not quite see how all this is exemplified in the subsequent action. He rightly explains the double 'interruptions5 of</page><page sequence="18">B. Otis: Klingner, Virgil 571 expected or logically required developments (Lausus was the expected and logical opponent of Pallas: everything has led up to the clinching combat of Turnus and Aeneas, not that of Aeneas and Mezentius) as pre liminary climaxes or highpoints that anticipate and ultimately intensify the final or decisive climax. He rightly sees the contrapuntal and quite un-homeric character of the Turnus-Pallas and Aeneas-Lausus con frontations. But he does not, I think, quite grasp the moral character of all this action, - that Aeneas and Turnus fulfill their fates by their own ethical behavior. Lausus and Pallas are the tests : Turnus by, so to speak, failing the test (his cruel hybris toward Pallas) arouses Aeneas to the point where final victory is within his grasp. Turnus' withdrawal by Juno is thus the beginning of his final and overarching moral problem: the choice between his own dishonor and an increasingly certain death. Aeneas, on the other hand, 'passes5 the test by showing (in the battle with Lausus) that he is not hybristic, can recognize pietas even when he sees it in an enemy. Thus therefore he justifies his coming victory over, even the kill ing, of Turnus. The great significance of this book, for all its occasional awkwardness and its relative monotony, lies in the deliberate novelty, the deliberately moral character of its action. Here for once Aeneas is put on his own and is not found wanting. The formerly dependent, driven, recalcitrant hero is at last 'released5 and given his head. In letting the fates find their way, Ju piter lets Aeneas (and of course Turnus also) find his way. Though the ulti mate climax is deferred, the moral climax is not. We now know that Aeneas must and will defeat Turnus and that the major problem is now Turnus'. Will he consent to be further shielded ? Will he finally redeem his honor by accepting death ? The previous 3 books (7, 8, 9) have as it were con centrated and highlighted the moment or crisis that this book describes. What follows is its resolution. 11. K.'s brief (8 pages) section on Bk. 11 is mainly a defense of its unity against, particularly, the arguments of Heinze. The first half (1-497) is divided into Trojan and Latin parts but both delineate the plight of Turnus : Aeneas, the victor, is ready to settle the war in single combat with him ; he, the defeated and the defeated as it were in his own absence, is not yet ready for this test that Drances, his personal enemy, now urges upon him. The news of the enemy's approach makes him break off the discussion (469). We might perhaps expect the second half to contain the Aeneas-Turnus duel so discussed in the first, but as K. truly points out such a sequence could be ?unvirgilisch?, though I find his explanatory comment that ?alles Bedeutende mu? sich in einem gegensatzreichen Kr?ftespiel durchdringen? some what enigmatic. He means, I take it, that Camilla is the opposite* and analogue of Me zentius in the preceding book. Her struggle and defeat at once puts off the decisive struggle to come, and supplies a ?Trugschlu? ?or preliminary and deceptive finale that yet anticipates and intensifies the true finale to come. Here as before with Mezentius, Turnus is absent at the very moment of Camilla's death and his army's (cavalry's) defeat. His own moral plight - the necessity of his coming to grips with Aeneas - is thus all the more acute: the tension rises for the finale. In this sense the book reveals a quite convincing unity. I agree with K. that the long speech of Diana (539-584 or 55 lines) on the childhood and upbringing of Camilla is awkwardly unepic, though in content intrinsic to the whole episode (it could hardly have been inserted in the muster of 7). It certainly completes our</page><page sequence="19">572 B. Otis: Klingner, Virgil picture of Camilla and also explains her naive and primitive action later on. But its form, nonetheless, is somehow not right. I cannot agree with his estimate of Turnus' reply to Drances, that it just enhances his tragic greatness. There is a real reluctance of Turnus to accept the combat with Aeneas. His bitter repudiation of the charge that he has been defeated or driven off the field (pulsus) shows (to me) a pudor or shame along with an inner reluctance to face the ulti mate test, that his angry words cannot conceal. His very haste to break up the council also shows this. That he should therefore repeat the experience of the previous battle and leave the wonderful Camilla, like Mezentius, to her fate, was bound to bring all his feel ings to a head. Furthermore the Camilla-Turnus relation was vastly closer and warmer than his mere alliance with the cruel Mezentius. There is indeed a touch of the erotic in it (despite Lavinia). The news of her defeat, his fury at hearing it, all prelude the frightful moment of 12 when, at a similar distance and withdrawal from the main events (suicide of Amata, etc.), he also hears similar news. But this, as K. rightly says, is the secondary or 'weak* climax before the final and decisive one. 12. K.'s brief (9 pages) section on the last book (12) is to me disap pointing. His entire concern is to show V.'s difference from Homer, the way in which V. unites and modifies the two Iliadic themes of the duel for the possession of Helen and the final wrath-duel of Hector and Achilles. What he says is acute and interesting but on the whole obvious and not very germane to an understanding of this remarkable book, in my view quite the greatest book of the 'Iliadic* Aeneid. The r?le of Lavinia is certainly ambiguous and weak: K. rightly emphasizes the importance of Amata; her devotion to Turnus is emotionally credible as the Turnus-Lavinia relationship is not. But the problem of Turnus is, in the last analysis, not determined by either Lavinia or Amata. Granting that the war had started and was in some sense excusable, Turnus was obligated to end it on terms that satisfied his honor. He thus could not avoid or even rightfully defer the proffered duel with Aeneas. The 12 th book, by repeating the circumstances of both 10 and 11, even also those of 7, the foedus and its disruption, the ignominious withdrawal of Turnus from battle, Juno's defense of Turnus' life by in effect making him a deserter, the deaths (in his absence) of his friends and allies (Mezentius, Lausus, Camilla) - and repeating them in an enhanced and climactic way (with the tempo raised, the ethos deepened, the action intensified) achieves a decidedly unhomeric effect, a dramatic tension that is also psycho logical and moral. Turnus is a tragic hero as Aeneas is not. The problem of this remarkable book is indeed not that of Turnus (every action of Turnus in it is utterly credible) but that of Aeneas. He is no Achilles: he has no single wrath, no masculine eros for a Patroclus. As we have seen, the intensity and dramatic convincingness of the Nisus-Eurylus episode - the essentially erotic substratum of its passion - could not in the nature of things belong to the relationship of Pallas and Aeneas. The killing of Turnus is movingly told - Aeneas' desire to avenge Pallas is in one sense an adequate motive - but it is not sufficiently dominant in the epic, it is too speciously brought in at its close, to justify the killing or direct our sympathy to Aeneas. It is Turnus that we have been most concerned with in Bk. 11 (even Camilla constantly reminds us of his absence, and of the news that he is presently bound to hear) and in most of 12: it is Turnus on whom with ever increasing inevitability weighs the dreadful choice between death and dishonor. In Homer this is not so: Achilles defies life and fate to avenge his friend ; in the final contest, the business of Helen, the possible substitution of a single combat for the war, the problems of Agamemnon and the Greek army, - all are forgotten ; only the wrath of Achilles, the death of Hector and the tragedy of both and of all men (which Achilles alone can see : this is the real import of his great scene with Priam) remain visible at the end. But of course Aeneas cannot be an Achilles: he is and must remain the Roman champion. His motives cannot be personal in an Achillean sense. One of the interesting things about Bk. 12 is the extent to which it reveals precisely this fact, - what we might call the Virgilian refusal to cheapen the tragedy in order to justify the optimism of the Roman conclusion of his epic.</page><page sequence="20">B. Otis: Klingner, Virgil 573 Even so long a review as this can hardly do justice to this remarkable book. It is neither in form nor in content a chef d'ceuvre nor is it a unity in any sense. But it gathers together a host of observations and ideas that taken in their entirety express the reaction of one of the greatest of Latin scholars to the greatest of Latin poets. I have perforce followed K.'s epi sodic and discrete approach for only so could I do justice to his book. Let me now try to summarize and briefly define what he has added to our picture of Virgil. His principal contribution, I feel, is stylistic. No one rivals him or has ever rivalled him in his analysis of the movement and flow of Virgilian verse. His pages on the first and ninth eclogues, on the great digression at the end of Georgics 2, on the beginning of Aeneid 1, the Dido speech in 4, the Entellus-Dares fight in 5, the battle scene of 9 or the Juno speech in 10 are shining examples of his critical power and his sensitivity. Virgil shows a new, varied and dramatically conceived (climax-building) verse structure. K. has revealed it to us as no previous scholar or critic has done. That he has also revealed the vast amount of further work to be done is itself a tribute to his analytic powers. He has not paid much attention to a good deal of other (especially non-German) work or to literary criticism in other (non-classical) fields. Recent discussions, for example, of Virgilian 'subjectivity5 or lyricism, of Virgilian metre (e. g. Knight), of the symmetry and proportionality of verse groups, of 'oral5 as opposed to 'literary5 epic style, of symbolism, of different rhetorical strategies, of the manipulation of the 'point of view5, seem in large part to have passed him by. Yet he also clearly stands for much that the 'new5 literary-criticism has advocated : he has lived and breathed in a world that has moved beyond Heinze. While much in his book derives from Heinze and an older scho larship (and in large part rightly so), there is much also that is not only new and original but is itself animated by a new critical spirit. V.'s re lation to his sources ? his use of Homer and particularly of Naevius, Ennius, and Lucretius - is not treated by K. as a mere matter of fact, a mere problem of location and identification, but as a study in V.'s poetical development, of the extent to which he made new out of old poetry. There are of course omissions here: K. says little or nothing of Cicero's poetry as a source (though a good case may be made for deeming it of more signi ficance than almost any other) and more direct comparisons with later Roman poets (e. g. Ovid, Lucan, even Valerius Flaccus and Statius) would have illuminated K.'s analysis of Virgilian verse. But for what we have we must be very grateful. There is little enough of the sort of criticism that, like K.'s, eschews empty generalization or factual enumeration and, instead, gives itself up to the movement and design of specific pieces of verse, to the language, rhythms and ideas in their actual connection and unity. Also K.'s contribution to Virgil is a good deal more than stylistic in the narrow, passage-analyzing sense. In place after place, he has detected subtle and as yet unnoticed divergences of plot between V. and Homer (notably e. g. in the battle scenes, in V.'s use of Odyssey 3 in Aeneid 8).</page><page sequence="21">574 H. Dahlmann: Marii Victorini ars grammatica, ed. Mariotti He has renewed our sense of V.'s Latin origins. Above all, he has tried to define Virgil's peculiar way of seeing the world : his tension of dark and painful with light and hopeful elements and his harmonization of them in a unity that also preserves them. I have several times expressed dissatis faction with the blurring of outlines, the vagueness and imprecision that in my view often goes with K.'s 'solution5 of specific problems by this con ception of Virgil's art. But I must also state my conviction that it con tains an essential truth which is often more fundamental and Virgilian than much ad hoc clarity. The great defect of this book, in my view, lies in its very structure or lack of structure. The discrete sections are not really connected: there is a minimum of what may be called architectonic generalization. The 'unity5 of neither the Eclogue-Book nor of the Aeneid is seriously considered and even in the section on the Georgics (the one connected account of a large Virgilian work) K. is almost exasperatingly unclear on the total plan or meaning of the work. This is especially the case with K.'s treatment of the pivotal books and passages such as Aeneid 2, 6 and 12. Though many in dividual Homeric passages are discussed, the total relation of Homer to Virgil is not. Knauer has pointed out that V. does not copy Homer spora dically or piecemeal but in his entirety or at least in the entirety of very large sections. K. himself admits the truth and novelty of this. But what thereby did V. gain : what was his real purpose or at least his real achieve ment ? What was accomplished by his use of the Odyssean nostos, the Iliadic wrath, the Iliadic Patroclus theme ? While we can point to many places where K. seems to touch such questions, we can point to none where he really poses them decisively. But we must, as I have said before, take this book for what it is. K.'s decisive contributions to Latin literature and to Virgil are not to be found in large architectonic works but in more or less discrete essays. It is in the analysis of specific passages that K. above all shines. When all is said and done, the great critic of literature is he who can bring us closer to the actuality of the writer's words. Much of the writing on the Aeneid might just as well have been based on that prose digest which the vita tells us V. composed as a guide to his labors of composition. In other words, dis cussion of Virgilian plot, ideas, topoi is often quite unrelated to his poetry. But K. always recognizes the poet, always knows that the poet's secret lies in the specific form of his fragile words. Of how many scholars can this be said?
