<plain_text><page sequence="1">ERIC WEIL Supporting the Humanities The present writer will have to start with an admission: he is convinced of the value of the humanities (to be precise, of history and philosophy). Even more, he is convinced that only the humanities are able to handle the question of the worth of human occupations?including the sciences proper?because the sciences are unable to reflect upon questions which bear on man considered as an acting, thinking, feeling subject, not as an object for analytic, factorial, causal analysis. He knows quite well that he is up against a mightly phalanx repre senting the opposing view and against its Goliath, old Thorstein Veblen, who, in his nearly unbearably repetitious manner, made bold to show that there is no legitimate place for traditional learning in modern society: the humanities, he claimed, "are, from the point of view of economic efficiency in the broader sense, disserviceable anachronisms," and the classical languages are "substantially useless information."1 This contention is formidable indeed, since Western, and even Eastern societies insofar as they are to be considered "modern," have gone over to Veblen, wiped out "anthropomorphic," "priestly," and "leisure class" ideals, put a stigma on concepts of "status" and "envious comparison," and re nounced everything non-productive and not "workmanlike." What Veblen called the study of causal relations in nature and society has become, it would appear, the central interest in our world. At least it seems so. Perhaps a change is becoming perceptible precisely in the place where Veblenism first exercised a strong influence?in the United States. A great deal of the student unrest, widespread throughout institutions of higher learning, had its origin and found expression in domains that may be called humanistic. Behind the unrest, however, was not so much a questioning of facts and methods, but of ends and meanings. And, surprisingly enough from Veblen's point of view, it happened in institutions open to criticism on many accounts, but certainly not for their lack of interest in "causal" sci ences, natural or social. Moreover, many of these institutions could not possibly be considered the preserve of the scions of the leisure class, but were filled with the offspring of the modern, industrial groups. I do not know to what ex tent the outlook of American students is changing (very legitimate material interests intervene in young people's choices of future careers); but a new interest in classical, "non-scientific," humanistic philosophy is gaining momentum 27</page><page sequence="2">28 ERIC WEIL among younger teachers and researchers, and problems and subjects for merly taboo among respectable people in the universities are making their appearance in "serious" journals. Sometimes one even gets the feeling that the public at large is not always sure that Veblen's ideal of workmanship and of production for production's sake is enough. The situation is not the same in Europe, probably because the movement toward the elimination of the "useless" started later in this part of the world and thus has, on the one hand, a greater life expectancy, while on the other, it must compete with a still surviving tradition, not to mention the insufficiencies in tech nical teaching sometimes defended with pseudo-humanistic or pseudo-humani tarian arguments. It would not be foolhardy to assert that the different re formes of the French university system are simply moves on the way to trans forming the universities into higher technical schools. No doubt nobody wants to throw out the humanities: we owe that much respect to our glorious past. But what use can we make of so many people educated in history, philoso phy, classical studies, and literature? Some of them are needed in our secondary schools, although fewer and fewer since such subjects play a smaller and smaller part in these schools. Their task ought to be?and probably will be?to instruct useful and usable young people for the service of a community given to production and consumption?a consumption which, by the way, would have appeared to Veblen purely ostentatious. Even in France certain young ( and not so young) people have begun to doubt the value of this conception, and again their problems as well as their muddle headed, often simply stupid answers fall under the heading of the humanities, not under that of the sciences. Although this activist fringe ( or vanguard? ) would not necessarily accept the suggestion that they are looking for a historical and philo sophical understanding in any academic sense, they will nevertheless have to look in these domains for answers if their answers are not to be arbitrary, vio lently destructive, and totally unconvincing in the eyes of the majorities ( and the minorities) which make the decisions. Their actions are very often simply inad missible; but the reaction which leads to these manifestations is very under standable: a life in meaningless comfort is a meaningless life. The indications are that nowhere can instruction alone replace education; by itself it does not form human beings capable of giving a sense to their existence except in blind adhesion to the moral and political quack, a kind of prophet whose number has become legion and whose success most often originates in appeals to half-decayed traditions which, half-forgotten though they are, continue to be transmitted through never explicitly formulated moral or aesthetic rules, attitudes, images, exemplary types. II It may be convenient to look at the place of leisure in our society in a way Veblen himself would have considered "scientific." The part of a human being's</page><page sequence="3">SUPPORTING THE HUMANITIES 29 lifetime given to production has dwindled rapidly and goes on diminishing. Nobody now enters the production process at twelve or thirteen years; the working hours and the working week's upper limit have gone down and continue to do so; workers and employees in France at present take four weeks' vacation; and the retirement age has been made lower and lower. It suffices to compare these figures with those obtaining in Veblen's time to see that leisure has become one of the most important products of industrial civiliza tion. It would be only mildly risky to say that we are moving toward a time when useful employment will be in short supply. Our political leaders are talking more and more of the need to create new jobs or to spread out existing ones by means of instituting shorter working hours, later entry, earlier retire ment. There once was, if we accept Veblen's thinking, a leisure class; it looks as if we are developing a civilization of general leisure. Even according to Veblenian principles there is always a place for un workmanlike activities, especially for those of the humanities, in a society which unavoidably produces leisure. In a rather un Veblenian spirit it should be added that these activities are not necessarily mere games and sports. It would not be a bad thing if citizens made their decisions not because this or that candidate looked pleasant, but because they understood, if not all the techni cal problems, at least the central issues and could eliminate the obscuring sales talk; if men and women did not follow quacks and cranks, but chose instead among ideals that might be, if not completely realized, at least approached; if they could distinguish historical factors from mythical explanations; and if the people at the helm looked at what in the past had led to success or failure (or had been the undoing of the actors); if moral and even aesthetic judgments were not confused with private preferences and personal tastes; and if the thinkers or artists were not lumped together with sincere madmen and authen tic speculators counting on the public's ignorance and on its fear of missing the last bus. But does this objective need for thought ( pleonastically, humanistic thought) correspond to a demand? Do the people in the market place or in the universities ask for more thinking, or has the movement come full circle? Has the bad name which, according to Veblen, was once attached to the sci ences now been inherited by the humanities, once considered "noble" be cause useless, now suspect because they have remained useless in terms of production? And if the humanities are nevertheless useful and necessary to the search for a meaningful and, by consequence, satisfying and non-violent life, what, exactly, can they do? What ought they to do? What are they doing? Ill It will be necessary to look first at the facts?the way the humanities are being pursued in terms of both teaching and research. Undoubtedly the hu manities are not disappearing from our curricula. The reasons our universities give for maintaining the humanities often have a dubious effect on the studies</page><page sequence="4">30 ERIC WEIL themselves. We maintain them because they form part of what we call our cultural inheritance; at the same time we consider it necessary that we ourselves and our pupils be capable of understanding our historical situation so that we can orient ourselves and help them to do so. Thus we are always tempted to limit our field to our national cultural inheritance?our national literature, the history of our nation, the development of our particular sort of thinking and our national philosophy. Most historians (there are great, even admirable exceptions) do their work in a somewhat narrow frame. French or English or American history is being written and, above all, taught, as if purely national lines of development actually existed and every foreign influence were just a disturbance, instead of an essential part of a single history in which all the threads contribute to the web of a single historical world. If it is only a ques tion of teaching, this curriculum can be justified to a certain extent; but research will always be the fountainhead of any education which aspires to do more than make people learn by rote dead facts, and here the answer will be very different. No examples are needed, for each of us has only to take cognizance of the situation in his own domain. But there is more to it. It must be added that, as another consequence of our organizational setup, the different chapters of the humanities do not form a book. Everybody is afraid of sticking out his neck and correspondingly lives on the air he finds under his carapace. People do history of philosophy and philosophy of history without giving much time to history. Moreover, ideas are retraced without relation to the conditions that, while they did not produce them (conditions never produce ideas), created the receptive atmosphere indispensable to their hearing and their survival. Possibly it will be objected that to pursue the end of a history without lacunae is a dream, since no teacher would be qualified to teach it and no student of sufficiently capacious intellect to receive it. But this criticism starts precisely from the misunderstanding of education here under scrutiny. Education is not a question of cramming, but of discovering and showing lines and problems and an orien tation; the cultivated man is not he who can quote the contents of an encyclo paedia, but he who knows what to look for and where to look for it. If research and teaching are not conceived in this spirit, we get the well-known result of boredom and disgust. IV Institutions of research and higher learning are inherently conservative. It is not in their nature, however, to become ossified and opposed to change. Ra ther they are conservative in the sense of the man who wants to preserve what in his eyes is valuable and who, for that very reason, is prepared to accept and introduce what is required to avoid violent destruction or the dying off of what he cherishes. In the sciences as well as in the humanities transmission and renewal must be reconciled. But the sciences have constituted theories that, at least in princi ple, are consistent and coherent. There is, always ideally speaking, a consen</page><page sequence="5">SUPPORTING THE HUMANITIES 31 sus, a community recognized by the participants in the common, although strongly subdivided, enterprise as qualified to pronounce not only on results, but on the interest of research projects. This (ideal) solidarity enables them to indicate unsolved problems that deserve tackling and to acknowledge the interest and value of new perspectives. Exceptions there are?as, for instance, Galois' revolutionary concepts in mathematics, which have been acted on only a long time after his death. We have no a priori certitude that other such cases may not be put at our doorstep by future scientific theorists. Nevertheless, exceptions remain exceptions, and an exaggerated fear of future reproaches should not lead us to accept what to the best of our knowledge we can consider only cranky, incompetent, and without scientific interest. The accumulation from revaluations and revolutions gives meaning to the concept of progress in the sciences ( and in technology which is based on science and often contributes, to the development of "pure"?that is, not immediately applicable?theory ). The situation of the humanities is at the same time exactly the same and basically different. It is the same as far as erudition?the discovery of facts and the methodical analysis of factual relations?is the object. That the humanities are concerned with far more than mere erudition, I hope I have made clear. But this is not to imply that erudition is superfluous or destructive of the spirit of the humanities. True enough, erudition, if it is nothing but erudition, is dry and dries out the mind, if at the start there was a mind and not simply a technical intelligence. But understanding and the effort to discover a meaning cannot possibly proceed without access to the documents, to what authors have actu ally written as opposed to the slipshod copying and printing of their work. Our results would be faulty were we to rely, since nobody knows all languages, on negligent translations, if we had no access to texts surviving only in manuscripts or extremely rare prints, manuscripts and prints which are not always easy to read and must be transliterated in order to become useful for people not all of whom are necessarily paleographers or epigraphists. Erudition is an indis pensable prerequisite to this process, and although the error is extremely popu lar, it remains a mistake to renounce the necessary conditions under the pre text that they are not the sufficient ones. It follows that there is accumulation, revision, and progress in the humanities as well as in the sciences. But enrichment in the humanities is of a different kind since research does not produce ideas ( al though unconsciously it depends on them: nobody would publish a text which he did not consider, at least potentially, to be interesting?interesting in its relation to an idea). Humanistic research is the accumulation of tools for work of another order than its own. Here lies part of the task of the institutions and the people who decide how the funds at their disposal should be used, for what concrete projects they are to be employed or collected. But the dreary fact is that the consensus which exists in the sciences to a large extent seems difficult to discover or to establish in the humanities. The absence of such a (more or less) tacit agree ment makes it no easy job to decide which line of research to further, which to drop. An additional difficulty results because the humanities have no relation to</page><page sequence="6">32 ERIC WEIL productive technology. A research chemist who discovers only that he is unable to discover anything of interest will take a job in industry for which he is prob ably highly qualified; on the other hand, because he has few alternatives to the academy, a young man who has opted for the humanities is, as a rule, forced to persevere in his labor although he may have come to hate what he is doing ( often letting out his spleen on his students ). Graver still, the humanities do not receive the incitements that, for instance, the fields of applied or applicable physiology or ecology do from the narrow public of direct users and the wide one of the people at large constantly indicating general trends and common de sires. And not only that: the academic institutions, which for these reasons are the home of the humanities and practically the only home for the humanistic student, are not necessarily favorable to large perspectives, particularly where collaboration would be desirable between specialists and depart ments traditionally living at a certain distance. Many an interesting thesis has not been written simply because it was too difficult to decide who was to supervise it. ( It would be more than useful to admit that a piece of work could be done under the auspices of different specialists?which, of course, would only be possible if such specialists were prepared to discuss the subject among themselves. This departmentalization makes for the neglect of whole lines of re search which do not belong to a well-defined domain or are not of evident im portance within its limits. Lastly, the students, or the great majority among them, are not generally interested in research; they normally and legitimately look first for information about things they have not learned in high school and their teachers are compelled to take care of these needs first. As a consequence, the heads of departments will concentrate, in their pedagogical plans and their recruiting policies, not on problems related to research and scientific progress, but on the desires, the attitudes, and the expectations of a public opinion in whose eyes the humanities remain just an ornament, not something serious. This public subscribes to a somewhat liberal kind of Veblenism, the signs of change we mentioned revealing only new trends, not a new power and pressure distribution. V Under these conditions it seems clear that the allocation of credits and personnel devoted to scientific progress in the humanities ought to come from authorities that are not involved in the fighting interests of departmentalized and mainly pedagogical humanistic teaching. The moot point is that a univer sity is but a collection of departments, and that research councils, such as the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in France or the big American foundations, have need of advisers. (They can also be under the sway of political authorities who, as in France, acknowledge with every sign of respect the autonomy of teaching and research and keep in their hands only the over all budget and the determination of what part of it will go to?Veblenishly?</page><page sequence="7">SUPPORTING THE HUMANITIES 33 interesting research and what is left, if anything, to the humanities. ) These ad visers are to be found mainly, not to say exclusively, in the universities, with the result that inter-departmental strife continues in the research councils, only on a higher level?each group fighting for a maximum of credits. Thus no overall planning exists and only projects in particular fields are considered, after which stage the financial authorities cut back still further. Under these cir cumstances, any work interesting in a wider perspective is not even consid ered, much less initiated. We are going around in circles: the only people who could change the situation are prevented from doing so because they depend on people who, as a rule, have no general views and do not even want to hear of such things. One or two instances may be useful. There is, for example, Hegel's Philoso phy of Right, one of the most influential books in the history of political thought and action; Marx as well as the father of German conservatism, von Stahl, al though they are both critical of the work, become understandable only in rela tion to it. Now, there are good reasons to believe that Hegel wrote his book in 1819-20 because he wanted to influence the discussions on the future constitu tion of Prussia which were going on in a Royal Commission. These discussions are not inaccessible, nor is Hegel's text, and it would be invaluable to know exactly the political intentions of Hegel's teaching for his and the following time. But philosophers will say that the work ought to be done by a historian, and historians will shift the load toward the philosopher, both declaring with becoming modesty that the subject is beyond their range. One may take as well the case of Neo-Stoicism. The present writer is con vinced that this school of thought played a major, even a central part, during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and hardly a negligible one in the eighteenth. Descartes, Spinoza, Calvin (who began his career with a com mentary to one of Seneca's writings)?the line could be traced back to Mon taigne and forward to Kant?cannot really be interpreted without a knowledge of this tradition; it follows that these authors are credited with an originality they themselves would not have admitted, simply because we do not study what every cultured man in their times had always present in his mind. But again philosophers will say that such research belongs to people interested in neo-Latin literature (there are not many of them, that matter certainly not be ing a part of the standard curriculum ) and the Latinists will refuse because they do not want to meddle with philosophy, or theology, or literature. Nobody seems to worry over this blank spot on our intellectual map. And if none of the present reprint houses thinks it can make money out of these sources, the institutions of higher learning, the foundations, and the university presses will certainly not make the necessary texts accessible. Even less will they take the initiative in proposing such subjects. But people might be tempted to under take the work if they were invited to do it and were sure of receiving the re quired leisure?that is the financial backing. To sum up, much could be done on the institutional level; much could be done in international collaboration, the way it is occasionally by UNESCO and</page><page sequence="8">34 ERIC WEIL by a small number of learned journals (but too often under pressure for arith metical international equilibrium and compromise). Yet it could be done and ought to be done. VI Erudition is necessary, and we could get it with well distributed money? for books, for leisure, for some apparatus. But the end, to underline it once more, remains understanding?understanding of ourselves, who are the heirs to ways of thought and living we are, for the most part, unable to seize and who there fore fall victim to what in another field is called unconscious repression. Now, looking for the hidden meaning of this past which dominates our pres ent, for the real meaning of what we carry with us without reflecting on it, is not a task undertaken by those colleges and universities which consider them selves mainly as teaching institutions, as transmitters of humanistic erudition. This does not signify that as such they are superfluous ornaments; the contrary is true in a civilization producing mass leisure, a civilization where people have to look more and more for something to replace work. It is, of course, possible to throw the job to those who do not refuse to make a profit out of it. Industrial tourism, thrilling television shows, moving and exciting novels and periodicals, alcohol, drugs, sex rationally organized and exploited are at our disposal if we want to kill time and to commit suicide by installments. In fact, we have to solve only the second half of the Roman problem of procuring panem et circenses for the masses: the pants there is, at least for the overwhelming majority, since those whom we term poor would have been regarded as leading a scandalously luxurious life by a worker, and not only by a worker, a hundred or a hundred and fifty years ago; what we are in need of and are consuming more and more of is the circenses. The pertinent question is whether the entertainments we are currently offered are good enough. Do they deliver the goods required? Here some doubt is permissible. One of the characteristics of our time seems to be the appearance of gratuitious violence, not the sort of violence all epochs have known?the violence of need?but disinterested violence, the most radi cal expression of the most radical boredom. The immediate consequence may possibly be considered as rather queer by many respectable people. It is this: universities, while going on with the indispensable work of instructing and of intellectually disciplining the young, ought not to take entertainment as their central task; rather, they should try to become places where grown adult men and women can discuss among themselves and with adult specialists what occupies their minds, and occupies it, at present, without that clarity which results from dialogue, dialogue being the way in which the unconscious and the half-conscious come to the surface and can be tackled. A substantial advantage could even accrue to the academic community from such contacts, since living more or less completely in the society of the very young often keeps the teacher's mind in a state of juvenility not altogether desirable. Teachers would be tempted to put into perspective</page><page sequence="9">SUPPORTING THE HUMANITIES 35 what they are too often teaching mechanically. Conversely, the adults would benefit from contacts with young people whose naive blindness to what under standing is, and simple ignorance can be extremely instructive for an adult mind, always in danger of considering as evident what in fact it has acquired only after long effort and with great pains. So much the better if that happens and if the humanist is thus enabled to establish both a living contact with the young and an authentic discussion with adults from the outside, thus gaining a feeling for the desires and needs of his time?something very different from, but equiv alent to, the impetus the sciences receive from the demands of economic so ciety. We need adults, and adults are more than simply humans past biological puberty: ripeness is all. But the humanities alone can educate people for being adult, and this education will always be the work of adults?adults knowing that they have to live with problems which will never be solved for good. Moral disquisitions (and moral is only another word for humanistic) are not for the very young, as Aristotle said, adding however that youth and adulthood are not dependent on birth dates; or, to invoke another authority, a young sage is better than an old fool. The problem is to produce (or to maintain where it exists) a culture for everybody who feels the need for something better than mere distraction, a culture for the masses, to use the ugly formula, but a culture which transforms masses into thinking and responsible men and women. Starting, but only start ing, with boys and girls, it would develop persons and personalities able to un ravel what obsesses them and pushes them toward violence, to feel instead of following instincts, to look with understanding at models of human perfection and at typical situations of conflict and tragedy, to gain self-reliance and self respect. The real task and the very justification of the humanities?and of the universities?lie there. VII What are the universities and the foundations to do about it? To state it bluntly, they distribute money?money necessary for what the humanist needs: leisure, books, and (marginally) a certain amount of apparatus, such as secre tarial help, use of computers, aid in publishing, altogether negligible require ments compared to those of the scientist. The problem resides where we al ready said it did: in coordination and planning. In principle it ought to be easy, and it is, so long as it remains a question of establishing facts, looking for documents, editing texts, preparing diction aries, and so on. But this kind of work, as we know only too well, can easily be technically competent and totally irrelevant. Where are the criteria of rele vance? Again we meet the trouble specific to the humanities: we cannot plan here as we are able to do in areas where we know at least our trouble spots and can say what problem is most urgent or most interesting. The same difficulty persistently returns; we have not got that explicit or implicit consensus which prevails among scientists.</page><page sequence="10">36 ERIC WEIL This is because fundamental questions in the humanities originate in our situation as it appears to us here and now. The surprising changes in the pref erence given at different times to different historical periods?to certain ways of feeling and thinking?are sufficient proof of a basic fact: we are always trying to understand ourselves. We project our problems onto the men and situations of the past and choose from the past so that the dialogue with its actors may help us in our own predicament through contact with something at the same time different and familiar. Now, although all that is past is different, not all of it always seems familiar: Virgil was a guiding star for a long time; now he has become an object of research, but he may once again become a model for poets, once again furnish new generations with human types of extreme importance to them. There is nothing in the human past that could not be revived; but in each resurrection everything is changed because the eyes looking at the past are not the same. In this sense, there is neither accumulation nor loss; there also is no progress and no rational planning. The new in the humanities very often, not to say regularly, comes as a shock and a scandal, an effect no revolutionary deed in the sciences seems to have provoked since science has become "modern"; and even the revolution which introduced this modernity was a scandal not for the scientists of the time, but only for those who looked at its consequences for religion and for the place of man in the universe?that is, for the humanists. For astronomers and physicists, Copernicus was not a danger, but a man who indicated ways and means for solving riddles which had occupied their minds a long time. But there is more. In the humanities every new perspective becomes part of what the humanities are fundamentally interested in. A "discovery" does not just drop out or become part of the common stock of knowledge, but gives rise to new problems. Erudite history is perfectly able to make out if an alleged fact took place and when; but history is not a simple recital of facts. The historian cannot avoid distinguishing between the important and the unimportant. He follows, without reflecting upon them, certain values, certain lines, a certain overall interpretation, and different historians will follow different lines. It is no accident, therefore, that the history of history has become a very respectable undertaking which in due course may lead to a history of the history of historiog raphy. In any case, both the history of history and the history of philosophy are legitimate subjects for philosophers. It is a problem for systematic philosophy to determine whether this reflection on reflection is infinite; fortunately we are not obliged to tackle that question here. But reflection on what is unexamined and reflection upon reflection exist and the fact is in itself of the highest importance for the way research and teaching are to be financed or directed. Here, as al ways, he who pays the piper calls the tune, especially when the traditional scholar, the gentleman of independent means (and means sufficient to the technical necessities of the present) has disappeared. This problem of direction is not easy, especially when everything new appears to later times naive and unexamined, and when what a first reflection reveals as naive and unexamined may yet gain through a second level reflection new life and new importance.</page><page sequence="11">SUPPORTING THE HUMANITIES 37 The number of "returns to . . . ," returns to Plato, to Kant, to Marx, to Clause witz, to Burckhardt, prove this observation abundantly. It is always the present that we are interpreting, but we interpret it by looking not at the past, but what we choose as our past, and we do it with the help of those who have preceded us, of those we choose as our predecessors among the inexhaustible riches at our disposal. Everything gets stale if it is simply handed down, and everything comes alive if we take it on with the feeling of tua res agitur. We do not know from the start what matters for us, we are trying to find out just that in the unceasing reflective dialogue of the humanities. The fundamental trouble is here, since ultimately the question is one of new approaches, not simply of solving old riddles or eliminating more or less well-known difficulties. VIII What, in the final analysis, can foundations, universities, and ministries of public instruction do? Quite a lot. They can?or, should one say, could??help to prepare tools for the humanist, an area where planning is both possible and to be wished for. A coordination, for instance, in the choice of subjects for doctoral dissertations could prevent useless efforts by eliminating themes which have the advantage only of being easily managed under personal and local con ditions or of a bibliography not too rich; multiple editions of texts might be avoided, and work on previously unedited sources encouraged. Research could be directed by indicating where specialized work would fill gaps which beginners under serious supervision would be perfectly able to close. The in stitutions could do much?and the point is particularly important?if they en couraged interdepartmental research and, to begin with, interdepartmental in struction and education. They could think seriously about the part they could, and therefore should, play in and for society as a whole, not only?not even principally?by looking for what is to be done in order to bring the lawyers, teachers, and doctors up to the newest standards, but by admitting and en couraging and inviting people in search of a humane existence to come into contact with one another and with our cultural tradition, a tradition whose very presence remains hidden to many of them. They will only come, of course, if, owing to stupid cramming, they have not already come to hate the humanities. All that requires money if research is to continue and to advance, not lots of money in comparison to what must be spent elsewhere, but money neverthe less. Unfortunately money is not enough; something more is required, a kind of daring which intervenes as well in scientific research, but to a lesser degree (although the financial risk is incomparably greater). As has been pointed out before, there is in science a consensus, actual or potential, about what is needed and where the open problems lie. The situation is profoundly different in the humanities. Physicists before Einstein knew that something was wrong with Newtonian space, although they were unable to tell what the trouble was or how it could be eliminated. On the other hand, nobody could have predicted what was to come out of research concerning the unconscious mind before Freud</page><page sequence="12">38 ERIC WEIL started to look at it and so opened perspectives nobody had dreamed of?with results that many consider regrettable and others appreciate as highly valua ble. In any case Freud's work constitutes a decisive event in our historical, moral and political life; we are not what we were before. Similar examples could be made into a very long list: Marx's view of history, or abstract painting, or modern poetry, or new philosophies?none of them could have been predicted or even asked for. It is no objection that they can be historically understood: of course they can, but only once they have appeared. Originality in the hu manities does not have the same meaning it has in the sciences, simply because original work in the humanities not only changes the direction of research, but changes us. The ground layer, the greatness, and the difficulty of the humanities appear when they are viewed in their nature?as a human and humane and humaniz ing study. This nature creates severe difficulty for those who have to make de cisions at the organizational level: Nobody can say beforehand if a new idea will change the world or if it will be judged a crank's obsession. The tempta tion is great to look at what is new with distrust because nobody wants to have his fundamental attitude questioned, be it that of his personal life or of his pro fessional work. New perspectives may, and will, render obsolete and uninter esting a man's conceptions and his research. (This is temporary, however, since nothing is ever definitively lost in the humanities.) It could be said that the troubles of the present, our common present, are there to guide us by showing us what is wrong; but that is true only when troubles are defined as our feelings of discontent, and the problem is precisely to transform these feelings into thoughts. There is much, very much, to do. Our present perspectives are the only ones at hand: we cannot just stand and wait for something new and original to come up. We live and act not tomorrow, but today, and we must pursue and finance and organize whatever seems to be our task at this moment in time, whatever seems to be obtainable here and now for the people we presently are. But we must be open?the institutions must be open?for what we are not accustomed to and what, as a rule, will shock us. We have to take risks, and the institutions have to play the part played a long time ago by Maecenas, without whose intervention we would never have known Virgil or Horace, and who probably, before he found Virgil and Horace, spent large amounts of money on people whom we have never heard of because they did not deserve to survive.
