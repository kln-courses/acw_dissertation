<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Vibratory Sense and Other Lectures. By DAVID KATZ. Orono, Maine University Press, 1930. Pp. 163. These lectures, written in semi-popular form, are based mainly on the works of Katz and his students at the Rostock Psychological Institute. Experimental and observational studies, mostly with animal subjects, indicate that while the phy- siological state of the organism conditions hunger to some extent, hunger depends to a high degree on the external circumstances in the immediate environment. Children are classed as "voluntary vegetarian" and "voluntary carnivorous" on the basis of expressed preferences for different kinds of food. However, since no history of the development of individual food habits appears to have been con- sidered, this classification can have little meaning. In studying facial characteristics a composite photograph of ten intelligent and of another of ten unintelligent children were made and compared in various ways. It is quite possible that this technique is not valid. The results obtained in various investigations on judging intelligence and personality traits from photographs suggest the possible hazards involved in an analysis from composite pictures of facial characteristics which accompany intellectual traits. The method is, of course, not new. Although the author warns the reader against Darwinian anthropomorphism, he rather uncritically describes the character of hens in such terms as "she was very envious," and "she did not like to be the subject of examination," and even tends to approve of anthropomorphic interpretation of animal behavior. Other topics considered are (I) localization of sound by dogs, cats, and hens; (2) the "vibratory sensation;" and (3) conversations of children. The book as a whole contains much information and stimulating observation. Psychologists and others will find it an interesting and valuable treatise. University of Minnesota MILES A. TINKER Folkways in China. By LEWIS HODOUS. London, Arthur Probsthain, 1929. Pp. vi, 248. This volume is a collection of material on folklore and customs gathered from personal observation by the author during long residence in China, from conversa- tions with Chinese and other residents, and from "wide reading" in Chinese sources, e.g., the Book of Rites. The thirty-seven short chapters cover a great variety of topics dealing with ceremonies and feasts, observances relating to celestial phenomena and seasonal changes, to agriculture, great alleged historical events, war, sacrifice, etc. There are no specific references and the reader is given no means of evaluating the data as to validity. The book, though interesting to students of human nature, is not scientific. General references and a list of Chinese names are given at the end of the book. J. P.</page></plain_text>
