<plain_text><page sequence="1">DISCUSSION: HUMAN RESPONSIBILITY (A REPLY TO PETER WARNER) by DANIELA VALLEGA-NEU According to Wamek, in my paper on decision in Heidegger's Contributions I am moving towards a "human" responsibility, which Warnek under stands in relation to a sense of decision that arises "before the decision as the occurrence of being." While Warnek is right to point out that human responsibility is a major concern in my paper, I do not com pletely agree with his interpretation of what, according to him, this means for me. I believe that Heidegger opens a way to rethink in an original way essential decisions when he understands them not as actions performed by a human subject, but as occurrences of be-ing to which humans are exposed. It is in this exposure that the issue of human responsi bility arises, but not as something over against the event of decision or over against the occurrence of be-ing. As I point out in my paper, as we find ourselves in major decisions, we find ourselves already to be responsible in the sense that we are called to take a stance in them. It is not clear to me how, from this, Warnek concludes that I think that "at least formally there is nonetheless a decision before the deci sion as such, and thus a responsibility before this being-called." What does "before" mean here? And what does "formally" mean? How could there be a responsibility "before" be-ing? How could there be respon sibility "formally," but maybe not "actually" or "substantially"? Within the thinking of Contributions, such distinctions do not make sense. "Before," as Warnek uses it, could be interpreted in several ways. It could mean "before" in a foundational sense, or in a temporal sense, or in a more "spatial" sense when one intends "before" in terms of "in the face of." Neither of these senses applies to how I attempt to think decision with Heidegger. If we understand "before" in a foun dational sense this would mean that human responsibility would be the condition of the possibility for an actual decision to take place.

The same applies if we understood "before" in a temporal sense. As far as "before" in the sense of "in the face of" is concerned this would reintroduce another common misunderstanding of Heidegger's thinking of being, because it would place the event of decision over against a human subject that would act "responsibly" towards it. In each case, decision is no longer thought performatively in the very occurrence of decision but repre sentationally as something occurring over against thinking. Warnek insists that I place an emphasis on human responsibility also in my critique of Heidegger's thought. And, again, I may agree; all depends on how we think this "human" responsibility and how we think human being. It may appear that I indeed introduce a "human" element into my interpretation of Heidegger's Contributions when I speak of Heidegger's totalizing move with regards to Western history and of his errancy in this respect. But this does not mean that I give prior ity to a "human" decision in distinction to be-ing's occurrence as deci sion. I believe that Heidegger is right when he understands human being to first find its determination in events of be-ing that exceed a determined human being. We come to be whom we are precisely in events of be-ing that occur as decisions in a historical world with things. In order to see and think this properly without slipping back into habits of thinking subjectively, as Heidegger says and Warnek points out, human being (not "humanity"!) needs to be transformed. Human being occurs in the ways in which the world and we ourselves dis close as we take a stance in the world. A transformation of human being with respect to the metaphysical tradition would mean that we no longer understand our being as defining the world as it appears to us, but rather as arising out of the finite disclosure of a world. In this context I would like to emphasize that the necessity to transform human being in the transition from metaphysics to other modes of being and self-understanding does not mean that human being founds be-ing's occurrences as decision and that human responsibility retains a pri mary status in the way decisions occur. I do follow Heidegger in his transformed understanding of human being and thus do not under stand his "totalizing move" on the grounds of a kind of subjective responsibility. I also would not relate Heidegger's blindness with respect to other</page><page sequence="3">discussion: human responsibility 283 historical modes of being primarily to the second blindness of which I speak (the blindness accompanying concrete determinations of being), as Warnek suggests, but I would relate it to the first blindness (the withdrawing source or ground of decisions). Heidegger's thinking, his being, and the decisions in which it finds its shape—like those in which any human being finds itself—are subject to a double blindness. This, by itself, is neither "good" nor "bad." Heidegger's "bold and power ful determinations" of Western history could indeed initiate transfor mations of being. I would only like to point out that these determi nations do neither arise out of a "de-humanized" be-ing "itself" nor are they performed by Heidegger "himself," but they arise in Heidegger's being-t/here, in a being that arises in a world and its history and that is exposed to the double finitude of death and of historically deter mined concrete possibilities of being. My concern is that in the way in which he understands history, Heidegger performs a resistance to the necessary limitations and possible errancy of the historical deter minations he finds, and thus he performs a resistance to an essential component of any decision. In order to understand how this resistance arises (again, I do not think that Heidegger "makes" this resistance by "himself"), one would need to explore further not only his relation to death but also Heidegger's lineages and concrete history. My inten tion is not to discredit Heidegger's thinking because of its errancy (I do not expect Heidegger not to err!), but rather to think further what decisions entail and what it means to think in decision. I would like to conclude by saying that I owe to Heidegger the possibility to develop this thought.</page></plain_text>
