<plain_text><page sequence="1">EMILY DICKINSON'S REJECTION OF THE HEAVENLY FATHER FRANCIS J. MOLSON IT is a commonplace that, as a girl, Emily Dickinson was re- peatedly urged to accept God's grace, convert, and be saved; however, she resisted and eventually rejected orthodoxy and its God. Scholars disagree whether Dickinson continued in her rejection until she died, but there is general agreement concerning her religious stance during her formative period.' John Pickard has summarized what he takes to be the con- sensus: Openly envying the serenity of converted Christians, she still found herself a rebel and quite mystified by the process of con- version and the doctrine of election. During the 1850s she stopped attending church and noted that all her family were religious but herself. By this she meant that she could not accept the harsh dogmas of innate depravity, arbitrary election, and predestination, or revere the Bible as true history and the only moral guide for man. In other words, she rejected all that made man insignificant and helpless before the crushing force of God.2 Although Pickard would have us believe that Dickinson was repelled by the harshness of certain orthodox dogmas, her re- fusal to convert and her eventual rejection of God cannot be explained only on the basis of a dislike for dogma. For one thing, this explanation seems oversimplified in its attempt to account fully for a phenomenon, religious conversion or its absence, about which little can be definitely known. For an- other thing, the explanation does not square with the evi- 1 See, for instance, George Whicher, This Was a Poet: A Critical Biography of Emily Dickinson (New York, 1938), 57, 7o; Richard Chase, Emily Dickinson (New York, 1951), 59-65; Thomas Johnson, Emily Dickinson: An Interpretive Biography (Cambridge, 196o), 16, 19; David Higgins, Portrait of Emily Dickin- son: The Poet &amp; Her Prose (New Brunswick, New Jersey, 1967), 47; William Sherwood, Circumference and Circumstance: Stages in the Mind and Art of Emily Dickinson (New York and London, 1968), lo-11. 2 John B.

An examination of the relatively neglected correspondence of the 1840's and 1850's reveals a high degree of probability that, first, Dickinson was willing to accept the orthodox God, dogmas and all, provided that He would grant her certain promises she felt He had made as the Heavenly Father; and, second, she finally rejected this God only after she realized that these promises which she had prayed for, as in- structed by Jesus, would not or could not be kept. This essay will suggest that Dickinson's rejection of the orthodox God has not been adequately understood and that for Emily Dick- inson the authenticity of this God, particularly as the Heavenly Father, was dependent upon an ability to hear her prayers and keep the promises He had made. I The young Emily's first experiential knowledge of God was, probably, of some vague, amorphous deity, imagined anthro- pomorphically, who loomed out of her childhood experiences. Like so many other imaginative children who are led to be- lieve that deity is alive and expected to behave accordingly, she may have also been aware of God as a kind, yet stern old man, who would help her in her need, provided she prayed to Him, and who would reward her faith with residence in the Kingdom of Heaven. Possibly we can detect some evidence of the impact this deity had on her as a girl from a statement she made to Higginson years later: When a few years old-I was taken to a Funeral which I now know was of peculiar distress, and the Clergyman asked "Is the Arm of the Lord shortened that it cannot save?" He italicized the "cannot." I mistook the accent for a doubt of Immortality and not daring to ask, it besets me still, though we know that the mind of the Heart must live if it's [sic] clerical part do not.

The outlines of the emergent deity should be discernible in the many allusions to spiritual matters in her correspondence of the 184o's and the early 1850's, and from descriptions of the religious program at Mt. Holyoke under Mary Lyon's tute- lage.4 Furthermore, without anticipating what an examina- tion of her letters might disclose, we probably would expect to learn that the new deity corresponded roughly to the ortho- dox God worshipped in western Massachusetts at this time. An examination does indicate that Dickinson was aware of the orthodox God whose claims her father and sister acceded to in 1850. What is surprising, however, in view of the cus- tomary interpretation is the discovery that Dickinson referred infrequently to this God as stern or demanding. One of these infrequent references occurs in a letter of March 28, 1846, to Abiah Root: Surely it is a fearful thing to live &amp; a very fearful thing to die &amp; give up our account to the supreme ruler for all our sinful deeds &amp; thoughts upon this probationary term of existence. (11)5 More frequently, the young Dickinson spoke of the joys prom- ised by God if and when she was converted. She ruefully re- marked to Abiah Root: But I feel that I have not yet made my peace with God. I am still a s[tran]ger-to the delightful emotions which fill your heart. I have perfect confidence in God &amp; his promises.... (13) As a matter of fact, earlier in 1846 she described herself as one who was fortunate to have experienced, if only briefly, a joy she took to be closely similar to that of conversion: 4 See Theodora Ward, The Capsule of the Mind (Cambridge, 1961), 15-28, and Jay Leyda, The Years and Hours of Emily Dickinson (New Haven, 1960), I, 122-150, passim. 5 Other references can be found in letters 175, 176, 193, 194, and 200.</page><page sequence="4">EMILY DICKINSON'S REJECTION 407 I think of the perfect happiness I experienced while I felt I was an heir of heaven as of a delightful dream, out of which the Evil one bid me wake 8c again return to the world 8c its pleasures. Would that I had not listened to his winning words! The few short mo- ments in which I loved my Saviour I would not now exchange for a thousand worlds like this. It was then my greatest pleasure to commune alone with the great God &amp; to feel that he would listen to my prayers. (11)6 Why should we find, where Pickard's description of Dick- inson's loss of faith would suggest otherwise, surprisingly few references to the stern, orthodox God? One explanation is that at a very early age Emily Dickinson found repugnant the doc- trines of election, innate depravity, and predestination asso- ciated with such a God, and that her repugnance made belief in Him untenable. Hence, there should be little explicit refer- ence to a stern, orthodox deity because Dickinson already had dismissed Him from her awareness. Such a supposition seems demanded if the hitherto accepted explanation is valid, but the evidence of the letters does not support this supposition. Disbelief in the orthodox God first became explicit in Dick- inson's correspondence in a letter dated November 27-Decem- ber 3, 1854 when the twenty-three-year-old poet confessed that "Sermons on unbelief ever did attract me." (176) Doubt- less her fascination with "unbelief" reflected a concern or crisis in her own faith; more importantly, it also implied the prior existence of faith in the orthodox God. That Dickin- son's claim does not indicate any marked erosion of her faith is demonstrated by her allusion, in a letter written at the same time, to a sermon "preached about death and judg- ment" that "scared" her. Although her remarks that her father and sister Vinnie "looked very solemn as if the whole was true" may suggest skepticism, whatever skepticism she felt was offset by the real concern manifested in the remain- der of the sentence: "..-. and I would not for worlds have them know that it troubled me,..." Her concluding com- 6 See also letters to, 20, 23, 35, and 36.</page><page sequence="5">408 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY ments on the sermon hardly imply a thoroughgoing skepti- cism: He preached such an awful sermon though, that I didn't much think I should ever see you again until the Judgment Day, and then you would not speak to me, according to his story. The sub- ject of perdition seemed to please him, somehow. It seemed very solemn to me. (175) This is not the response of one who no longer believes in "perdition." Further, it is not until late August and Septem- ber of 1858 (letters 193 and, especially, 194) that more or less solid evidence can be found demonstrating Dickinson's dis- belief in dogmas; and her often-quoted remark on not respect- ing "doctrines" appears in a letter dated February 13, 1859: Mr. S. preached in our church last Sabbath upon "predestination," but I do not respect "doctrines," and did not listen to him, so I can neither praise, nor blame. (2oo) Only after 1859 does Emily Dickinson begin to speak more frequently of a stern and unjust God. Thus, contrary to the usual description of the young Dick- inson's religious stance, the evidence in her extant letters does not support the contention that at an early age or during her adolescence she rejected either the God or dogmas of ortho- doxy. Moreover, the infrequency of any references to divine sternness or untoward demands is best explained simply: she believed in the orthodox God and, perforce, accepted the various dogmas implied by her belief. The obviousness of this explanation may account for its not being seriously con- sidered previously. Also, a reluctance to take the young Dick- inson at her word may have induced commentators to pay little attention to what she herself said. Admittedly, a large part of the early correspondence may strike us as effusive, flawed by religiosity, and contaminated by the cult of senti- mentality. Yet these qualities do not erode the genuineness of what the young woman was trying to articulate. Further, it is unfair to label Dickinson's religious sentiments as shal-</page><page sequence="6">EMILY DICKINSON'S REJECTION 409 low and unworthy of our serious attention.' We do not read Emily Dickinson, even in her mature phase, as a theologian but as a poet whose work is permeated with religious themes. We should keep, then, our attention focused in these early letters on what she herself says about herself and her relation with God even if at times the posturings of "Emilie" are em- barrassing. Emily Dickinson's faith in the orthodox God becomes more understandable if several of its aspects are kept in mind. The first is implied in the Protestant nature of her religious com- mitment. The raison d'etre of Protestantism is that God exists for the individual solely through the latter's experience of God. The Protestant is aware of God through his encounter with God, that is, his experience of God. In theory, Protestant theology does not admit to any authority that can tell an in- dividual what God is. Consequently what God is, or better, what an individual thinks or senses God is, is conditioned by his encountering God somewhere, sometime. Expressed in theological terms, this means that the Protestant can speak of the essence of God only through his experiences of God's existence. Because Emily Dickinson was Protestant in her commitment, it follows that the nature of the God she believed in shifted either as her awareness of God varied or as her awareness of the ways in which God impinged upon her exis- tence altered. The point of all this is that the testimony of Dickinson's correspondence indicates that the God of ortho- doxy impinged upon her awareness during her formative years primarily as the Heavenly Father, or to use Mrs. Ward's phrase, the father God.8 A second aspect of Dickinson's faith in the orthodox God 7 For instance, William Sherwood remarks of her early religious experiences: "If we realize that behind much of the humility of her poetry lies egotism and that one of the principal functions of the religious elements in it is to express the poet's sense of her own exclusiveness, we will not be surprised by the ab- sence of any expression of profound religious conviction in her early life. Emily Dickinson's conduct at Mount Holyoke was that of the 'hold-out,' not that of the devout believer." Circumference and Circumstance, io. 8 Ward, The Capsule of the Mind, 45.</page><page sequence="7">410 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY is causally related to her awareness of God as the Heavenly Father. If God is her Father, then, it becomes incumbent upon her to comport herself vis-A-vis this Heavenly Father as a child.9 This posture, she realized, she could best manifest, as Jesus himself pointed out, by having confidence in God the Father's promises and then by expressing her confidence through prayer. However, as we will also see, Dickinson made unorthodox alterations in what otherwise would have been merely a conventional Christian stance. First, she decided that for herself the Heavenly Father's authenticity depended upon her receiving from Him what she prayed for. Second, she be- came convinced that what she prayed for, Heaven, encom- passed, among other things, the Lover, that is, not any specific individual, but the embodiment of her desire for fulfillment in friendship and love. If we consider these aspects of Dickinson's faith, we are in a better position to perceive why she was not unduly bothered by the unattractive or harsh features of the orthodox deity. As long as Dickinson retained her confidence in the Heavenly Father's ability and willingness to grant her prayers, she could overlook any possible distaste. When her prayers went unan- swered, however, the authenticity of the Heavenly Father be- came suspect and eventually eroded her faith. No longer did there exist any viable counterweight to the harsh dogmas, and they moved into the foreground of her consciousness. Then she felt free, for instance in poems like "It always felt to me- a worry" (598) and "Abraham to kill him" (1317), to unburden herself of her indignation and mockery directed now, how- ever, at what was obviously an unjust, arbitrary, and petty God, a God she no longer accepted as authentic. 9 Genevieve Taggard in The Life and Mind of Emily Dickinson (New York, 1930), 34-35, and Clark Griffith in The Long Shadow: Emily Dickinson's Tragic Poetry (Princeton, 1964), 280-282, maintain that Dickinson's awareness of God was strongly affected by her relationship with her father. In their psychological argument both Taggard and Griffith are highly speculative and analytic. For that reason in this essay I have not utilized their work since I restricted myself to an examination of the early correspondence to discover what Dickinson her- self said concerning her own awareness of God.</page><page sequence="8">EMILY DICKINSON'S REJECTION 411 II Emily Dickinson's first explicit reference to God as her Heavenly Father occurred in a letter to Jane Humphrey, April 3, 185o: How lonely this world is growing, something so desolate creeps over the spirit and we dont know it's [sic] name, and it wont go away, either Heaven is seeming greater, or Earth a great deal more small, or God is more "Our Father," and we feel our need in- creased. (35) Subsequently, there are sporadic references to the Heavenly Father, mostly in letters to Susan Gilbert.10 Since Susan was orphaned, Emily may have been inclined to speak of God as the Heavenly Father to induce Susan to consider Him as com- pensation for the loss of her earthly father. More significant is the letter Dickinson wrote to Edward E. Hale seeking in- formation about Benjamin Newton ten months after the lat- ter's death on March 24, 1853: He often talked of God, but I do not know certainly if he was his Father in Heaven-Please Sir, to tell me if he was willing to die, and if you think him at Home, I should love so much to know cer- tainly, that he was today in Heaven. (153) Clearly, she was asking not so much about Newton's faith in God-that she already knew-but about Newton's certainty that the God he spoke about was the Father in Heaven. It is evident that Dickinson, in wanting to know whether Newton had found this certainty, was herself looking, perhaps un- consciously, for the same reassurance. Apparently, by 1854 she was encountering some difficulty in harmonizing her no- tion of what the Heavenly Father ought to be with her ex- periences of what He really was. In her second letter to Thomas W. Higginson, April 25, 1862, Dickinson remarked of her family: "They are religious -except me-and address an Eclipse, every morning-whom 10 Letters 73, 74, 77, 85, 88, io2, and io7.</page><page sequence="9">412 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY they call their 'Father'" (261). These remarks do not just in- dicate Dickinson's unorthodoxy, as many commentators have observed, but explain, if only indirectly, and mark chronologi- cally her disenchantment with God as the Heavenly Father. Even allowing for Dickinson's archness, we see that on one level she is describing her family's religion in terms of the conventional ritual of praying ("address") to God the Father ("an Eclipse. . .they call their 'Father"'). On another level, by referring to God as an eclipse she is evaluating the ritual of prayer as futile: God is like the sun in eclipse because His presence is no longer detectable. She is implying that if the prayers God Himself stipulated go unanswered when ad- dressed to Him, what other conclusion can she draw except that no one is there to answer or wants to or can. Her family may call this God a "Father," but she knows better: her prayers have apparently gone unanswered, and a God who does not answer is no Father as far as she is concerned. By the time of the great crisis, 1860-1863, Dickinson's faith in God the Father had eroded away; and, as her letter to Higginson sug- gests, one cause may have been her disillusionment over what she took to be the Heavenly Father's inability to keep His word. God the Father, then, like the putative anthropomorphic deity, held out promises as inducements for belief. In the case of the Heavenly Father, Jesus, functioning as mediator, prom- ised spiritual joy and consolation, provided a person gave up the world and accepted Jesus as savior. At the age of fifteen, Emily was already well aware of this function. As she indicated to Abiah Root: Many conversed with me seriously and affectionately and I was almost inclined to yeild to the claims of He who is greater than I. How ungrateful I am to live along day by day upon Christs bounty and still be in a state of emnity to him &amp; his cause. (lo, January 31, 1846) That same year, again to Abiah, Dickinson revealed her ten- dency to associate the Heavenly Father with promises: "I have</page><page sequence="10">EMILY DICKINSON'S REJECTION 413 perfect confidence in God &amp; his promises ... ." (13) Ten years later she still exhibited the tendency, describing to Mrs. Hol- land heaven as a "wonderful world... which makes such promises ... ." (185, early August 1856?) Implicit in these passages is the necessity of asking for what has been promised, that is, the necessity for prayer, the most appropriate manifestation of confidence in God's promises. Praying, for Emily Dickinson, as far as we can determine from the letters of these years, was not meditation or contempla- tion, or a subservient protestation of her inferior position before Divinity. Prayer was, primarily, a request for some- thing, usually couched in the phraseology of childlike trust as revealed by the following remark: If God should choose, Jennie, he could take my father, too, and my dear Vinnie, and put them in his sky, to live with him forever, but I shall pray to him every day of my life, not to take them. (86)11 The trust and confidence were not always total. Once in a while Dickinson expressed herself as one who, while compos- ing herself to show confidence, simultaneously was preparing herself for the possibility of no answer: If every prayer was answered, there would be nothing left to pray for-we must "suffer-and be strong." Shall we be strong-wont suffering make weaker this human-it makes stronger not us-but what God gave, and what he will take-mourn our bodies ever so loudly. We do not know that he is God-and will try to be still- tho' we really had rather complain. (3o) In 1881, while writing of George Eliot's death to her Norcross cousins, Dickinson briefly alluded to what she still held essen- tial to a child's faith: The gift of belief which her greatness denied her, I trust she re- ceives in the childhood of the kingdom of heaven. As childhood is earth's confiding time, perhaps having no childhood, she lost her way to the early trust, and no later came. (7 1o) 11 See also letters 73, 96, and 133-</page><page sequence="11">414 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY Perhaps even more telling are her remarks that same year to Mrs. Holland on the death of her husband: The lost one was on such childlike terms with the Father in Heaven. He has passed from confiding to comprehending-per- haps but a step. I shall never forget the Doctor's prayer, my first morning with you-so simple, so believing. That God must be a friend-that was a different God-and I almost felt warmer myself, in the midst of a tie so sunshiny. (731) Since Dickinson respected Dr. Holland as a writer, editor, and intellectual, what she said of him to his wife so soon after his death she meant as eulogy. Thus, the implications in the de- scription of that first morning must be taken seriously. With the Hollands as additional witnesses, Dickinson knew that God the Father as a form of deity existed and that "sunshiny" ties with him were possible. She herself, she further knew, was no longer able to possess sucha relationship, most prob- ably because she had lost her confidence in this God. Both Dr. Holland and she had been acquainted with the same deity but their experiences had differed. Dr. Holland had been able to retain his confidence; she had not. Approximately a year and a half later, Dickinson began a letter to Maria Whitney: You are like God. We pray to Him, and He answers "No." Then we pray to Him to rescind the "no," and He don't answer at all, yet "Seek and ye shall find" is the boon of faith. (830) Towards the end of her life, then, years after she discarded the father God as inauthentic, Dickinson was still expressing her conviction that faith in such a God necessarily implied the explicit asking God through prayer for the promises He had made. Prayer as a crude, materialistic quid pro quo arrangement is repugnant, and surely the most debased form of such prayer is the small child's petulantly repeated "Give me, give me"</page><page sequence="12">EMILY DICKINSON'S REJECTION 415 litany. In Dickinson's correspondence there is no explicit evidence that she ever practiced this debased praying. Further, for the period 1856-186o, where we would most likely expect to find that Dickinson began to perceive that prayer to the Heavenly Father might degenerate into a quid pro quo haggling since her confidence in Him was rapidly dissipating, we can find nothing. The absence of both kinds of evidence may be attributable to the paucity of letters during these years. David Higgins, in his study of Dickinson's prose, says of this period: Not a single letter or poem by Emily Dickinson can safely be dated 1857. The gap in biography is unfortunate because it may obscure the event or events which turned a bright young woman into a major poet. To add to the problem, there are no poems and few letters of 1855 and 1856, and no datable letters of 1858 before June.12 III What did Emily Dickinson want from the Heavenly Father? What was her prayer? In other words, what were the promises He had made, the granting of which became her criterion for His credibility and authenticity? The answers are the same: heaven, a "golden dream," and a "dear fancy." Although "heaven" carried a multitude of meanings for Dickinson throughout her life, "golden dream" and "dear fancy" are phrases found only in her early correspondence where in conjunction with "heaven" they are used to repre- sent her expectations of friendship and love. Through a study of her use of these phrases, we are not only able to gauge her deepening awareness that her love for her friends was becom- ing a serious rival of, if not an idolatrous substitute for, the Heavenly Father, but we also perceive the unwitting irony of her insistence that the Heavenly Father was responsible for guaranteeing the very things, success and permanence, that conceivably would insure the supremacy of human love over 12 Higgins, Portrait of Emily Dickinson, 85.</page><page sequence="13">416 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY God the Father. Thus, we are in a better position to under- stand both her making the Heavenly Father's meeting this responsibility of the test of his authenticity, and her eventual rejection of this God after she realized he was unwilling or in- capable of granting her dream, her fancy, heaven. Like any girl in an orthodox Christian family, Emily Dick- inson had been instructed to cherish friendship as another of God's gifts. Further, a cursory perusal of her letters to her friends reveals how intense and sentimental her friendships became. However, from the first Dickinson realized that her friends' welfare and the intensity of her friendships were intimately linked with her own stance towards God. Her conviction that her friends were gifts from God she once stated to Abiah Root: I hope no change or time shall blight these loves of ou[r]'s, I would bear them all in my arms to my home in the glorious heaven and say "here am I my Father, and those whom thou hast given me. " (50)13 The heavenly home with God the Father Dickinson had men- tioned in her letter to Edward Everett Hale as she sought to know whether the latter felt Benjamin Newton would be "at Home... today in Heaven." In a letter to Mrs. Holland she described the "heavenly home" whose chief feature is that all of Dickinson's friends would be there: My only sketch, profile, of Heaven is a large, blue sky, bluer and larger than the biggest I have seen in June, and in it are my friends -all of them-every one of them-those who are with me now, and those who were "parted" as we walked, and "snatched up to Heaven." (185) The relationship among God, Dickinson, and her friends did not remain as pleasant as these letters suggest. In a letter to Abiah Root in late 1850, Dickinson wrote at some length about love and friendship. The letter may be sentimental, but behind the words we not only sense Dickinson's strong 13 See also letters 73, 85, and lo2.</page><page sequence="14">EMILY DICKINSON'S REJECTION 417 desire to have her friends always with her, but detect a new element in her thinking that eventually will become promi- nent. This is Dickinson's tendency to hoard her friends, to resent their being "snatched up to Heaven," to combat God, so to speak, if He desires them: When I think of the friends I love, and the little while we may dwell here, and then "we go away," I have a yearning feeling, a desire eager and anxious lest any be stolen away, so that I cannot behold them. I would have you here, all here, where I can see you, and hear you, and where I can say "Oh, no," if the "Son of Man" ever "cometh"I (39) In a somewhat enigmatic passage from the same letter she im- plied the first stirring of rebellion against God's practice of "snatching": "I will try not to say any more-my rebellious thoughts are many, and the friend I love and trust in has much now to forgive." Eight years later she had become fully aware that her tendency to hoard her friends had become even more pronounced. "My friends are my 'estate.' Forgive me then the avarice to hoard them!" (193) These last expressions reveal a mind that has come to compare the Divine claims for whole- hearted allegiance with those of human love and is tempted to judge the latter superior. She admitted as much to Samuel Bowles: God is not as wary as we, else he would give us no friends, lest we forget him! The Charms of the Heaven in the bush are superceded I fear, by the Heaven in the hand, occasionally. (193) Two letters in 1852 mention a golden dream that elicits from Emily Dickinson a stronger faith than God does, and there is reason to maintain that the golden dream represents her expectations and hopes for success in love. The first of these letters Dickinson wrote to Jane Humphrey April 3 at the height of a religious revival. The opening paragraph is permeated with a sentimental weariness over "faded" worldly things which is traceable to Jane's absence, the news that her father is seriously ill, and to the revival itself. In the second</page><page sequence="15">418 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY paragraph the weariness gives way to a wistful tone when Emily Dickinson described her inability to be converted and to accept Christ's call in spite of the obviously pleasurable ef- fects wrought by conversion: It certainly comes from God-and I think to receive it is blessed- not that I know it from me, but from those on whom change has passed. They seem so very tranquil, and their voices are kind, and gentle, and the tears fill their eyes so often, I really think I envy them. (35) This wistfulness is only partly attributable to her sharing Jane's concern for her father. A more important cause is Dick- inson's fear of her inability to be converted and thus be totally denied the joy that others, including her sister Vinnie, had been permitted to possess. The full reasons for Emily Dickin- son's failure to undergo conversion at this time will never be known, but we can be sure that it did not stem from any re- fusal to recognize the appropriateness of the required father- daughter relation. A more likely explanation involves Dick- inson's stubborn unwillingness to play the dutiful daughter and abide by all the terms of the relationship-among them, especially, the rejection of the world and its goodness-in spite of the fact that this was one sure way she could experience the joys of conversion. Although in the same paragraph she refers to herself as "standing alone in rebellion," yet the context greatly tempers the apparent defiance: Christ is calling everyone here, all my companions have answered, even my darling Vinnie believes she loves, and trusts him, and I am standing alone in rebellion, and growing very careless. The passage demonstrates that, although Dickinson has opted for the Protestant stance, her rebellion does not yet have the purity of radical protestantism. The second paragraph makes clear that Emily Dickinson wants God very much to be her heavenly father: she feels the need. The third paragraph introduces a new topic: I would whisper to you in the evening of many, and curious things</page><page sequence="16">EMILY DICKINSON'S REJECTION 419 -and by the lamps eternal read your thoughts and response in your face, and find what you thought about me, and what I have done, and am doing; I know you would be surprised, whether in pleasure, or disappointment it does'nt become me to say-I have dared to do strange things-bold things, and have asked no advice from any-I have heeded beautiful tempters, yet do not think I am wrong. Dickinson refers to the winter just past as "all one dream" from which she has not yet awakened. Further, she "would always sleep, and dream, and it never should turn to morning, so long as night is so blessed." As if these remarks were not sufficient to bewilder Miss Humphrey, Dickinson went on to speak of something, in all likelihood a golden dream, inas- much as it was woven from all that she had previously de- scribed and would include "one gold thread in it, a long, big shining fibre" which would "fade away into Heaven" while she held it and thence returned. This part of the paragraph she concluded breathlessly: I hope belief is not wicked, and assurance, and perfect trust-and a kind of a twilight feeling before the moon is seen-I hope human nature has truth in it-Oh I pray it may not deceive-confide- cherish, have a great faith in-do you dream from all this what I mean? Nobody thinks of the joy, nobody guesses it,... Although a bit incoherent, the third paragraph does reveal, upon careful scrutiny, Dickinson's conviction that there exists a joy that would be hers and is hers now but only as dream. In a way this dream functions as an earnest for the wished-for joy's existence. The dream, moreover, is secular; it is of earthly happiness. At the same time, because of its link with heaven, it is sanctioned by God the Father. She believes in this dream and its eventual materialization so much that she suspects this faith is stronger than her faith in God. It is easy to perceive how the attractive golden dream could come to compete with the claims of orthodox religion so that what the golden dream represented could become a serious rival of the Heavenly Father's. However, in her insistence that the dream is heaven-</page><page sequence="17">420 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY sanctioned, paradoxically Dickinson seems to be implying the Heavenly Father's approval and, hence, responsibility for bringing about its materialization. Finally, if Dickinson's weariness represents her discontent over the transience of earthly things and her wistfulness sug- gests her inability to accept an other-world perspective uncon- ditionally, then it is possible to argue that her remarks in the third paragraph are an attempt to stake out a middle position by which she can derive pleasure from earthly things that are still sanctioned by "Heaven." Further, this middle position is able to generate a joy comparable to the joy of conversion and do so under the aegis of "Heaven": thus she is enabled to salve her conscience and remain a dutiful daughter of God in heaven. Approximately one month later and again against a back- ground of the continuing religious revival, Dickinson corre- sponded with Abiah (36). Among other things, she mentioned that because of her mother's acute neuralgia attack, she had to turn down regretfully an invitation to go riding from some- one "so dearly loved" who just dropped by. (Except that the visitor was a man, we know nothing about his identity.) Ap- parently shifting the topic to the revival, Dickinson reiterated her determination not to convert, ostensibly content to cate- gorize herself as "one of the lingering bad ones" in spite of her knowledge that through her stubbornness she was effectively cutting herself off from the very joy she desired. Her subse- quent remarks reveal, however, that her primary concern was not her obduracy and the joys of conversion, but the delight of the "dearly" loved friend's invitation which this time she had to reject. It is true that she had felt "much abused," but she consoled herself "dreaming a golden dream," a phrase taken from her description of what she had been doing which answered any questions Abiah presumably might have had. Dickinson has: ... come from "to and fro, and walking up, and down" the same place that Satan hailed from, when God asked him where he'd been, but not to illustrate further I tell you I have been dream-</page><page sequence="18">EMILY DICKINSON'S REJECTION 421 ing, dreaming a golden dream, with eyes all the while wide open, and I guess it's almost morning.... (36) The object of Emily Dickinson's friendship and love, the content of her golden dream, encompassed women and men. In addition to the cryptic mention of the "dearly" loved visi- tor, there is a lengthy passage in a letter to Sue Gilbert, early June, 1852, in which Dickinson, after recounting that Martha, Sue's sister, had called the preceding evening, and the two had talked about "life and love," and also wondered about "that great blessedness," marriage, which might be theirs someday, confided her innermost thoughts concerning marriage: Those unions, my dear Susie, by which two lives are one, this sweet and strange adoption wherein we can but look, and are not yet admitted, how it can fill the heart, and make it gang wildly beat- ing, how it will take us one day, and make us all it's [sic] own, and we shall not run away from it, but lie still and be happyl You and I have been strangely silent upon this subject, Susie, we have often touched upon it, and as quickly fled away, as chil- dren shut their eyes when the sun is too bright for them. I have always hoped to know if you had no dear fancy, illumining all your life, no one of whom you murmured in the faithful ear of night-and at whose side in fancy, you walked the livelong day; and when you come home, Susie, we must speak of these things. How dull our lives must seem to the bride, and the plighted maiden, whose days are fed with gold, and who gathers pearls every evening; but to the wife, Susie, sometimes the wife forgotten, our lives perhaps seem dearer than all others in the world; you have seen flowers at morning, satisfied with the dew, and those same sweet flowers at noon with their heads bowed in anguish before the mighty sun; think you these thirsty blossoms will now need naught but-dew? No, they will cry for sunlight, and pine for the burning noon, tho' it scorches them, scathes them; they have got through with peace-they know that the man of noon, is mightier than the morning and their life is henceforth to him. Oh, Susie, it is dangerous, and it is all too dear, these simple trusting spirits, and the spirits mightier, which we cannot resistl It does so rend me, Susie, the thought of it when it comes, that I tremble lest at sometime I, too, am yielded up. Susie, you will forgive me my</page><page sequence="19">422 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY amatory strain-it has been a very long one, and if this saucy page did not here bind and fetter me, I might have had no end. (93) Dickinson's ambivalence towards marriage probably reflects the conventional modesty expected by society in her time. On the one hand, marriage, an "adoption," is "sweet"; and the life of a young lady about to marry is "all too dear." On the other hand, the "adoption" is "strange" and "dangerous." The r le of the wife and her duties are described obliquely in terms of flowers that are freshened by the dew in the morning and later at noon are bowed by the heat. But will they seek again the dew? No, they will "cry for sunlight, and pine for the burning noon, tho' it scorches them, scathes them" for "they have got through with peace." Marriage and its sexual mysteries are dangerous, yet simultaneously so dear that just thinking about them "rends" Dickinson, sets her "trembling" lest at sometime she be "yielded up." The last phrase and the previous image of the flowers bowed before the hot sun under- score the essential passiveness of the feminine rBle in court- ship and marriage in Dickinson's day. More importantly, when Dickinson wondered whether Sue ever had a "dear fancy," someone about whom she could speak to the night and at whose side she could walk, she was not suggesting that her brother Austin was this "dear fancy." The past tense of the verb makes it clear that the supposed fancy must have existed before Austin entered Sue's life. The pur- pose of the "fancy," presumably, was to illumine a young girl's life, give it point-functions analogous to that of the golden dream. Subsequently, we are to assume, a real person-in Sue's instance, this is Austin-takes the place of the fancied man and the "dear fancy" actualizes and culminates in marriage. We should note that for the "bride and the plighted maiden," those virtually assured a husband, those for whom the golden dream is about to materialize, each of their days is "fed with gold," as if from a golden source. Finally, Dickinson's mention of the "dear fancy" and the confiding tone of the passage strongly suggest that she possessed her own "dear fancy" and</page><page sequence="20">EMILY DICKINSON'S REJECTION 423 clearly expected his transformation into a real lover and hus- band. Early in 1852 Dickinson can be observed explicitly moving towards an attitude that considers love as an idolatrous sub- stitute for the orthodox God when she urges Sue Gilbert not to attend Sunday meeting but to worship at the altar of love within their hearts: The bells are ringing, Susie, north, and east, and south, and village bell, and the people who love God, are expecting to go to meeting; dont go Susie, not to meeting, but come with me this morning to the church within our hearts, where the bells are always ringing, and the preacher whose name is Love-shall intercede there for usl (77) But it is in a later letter to Sue, dated about 1854, that Dick- inson openly confronts her own suspicion that her love is a form of idolatry and that God may be punishing her infidelity by gradually taking her friends away. In spite of any fears of punishment she still finds it difficult to resist the temptation to regard human love as superior to God's: Sue-you can go or stay-There is but one alternative-We differ often lately, and this must be the last. You need not fear to leave me lest I should be alone, for I often part with things I fancy I have loved,-sometimes to the grave, and sometimes to an oblivion rather bitterer than death-thus my heart bleeds so frequently that I shant mind the hemorrhage, and I only add an agony to several previous ones, and at the end of day remark-a bubble burst! Such incidents would grieve me when I was but a child, and perhaps I could have wept when little feet hard by mine, stood still in the coffin, but eyes grow dry sometimes, and hearts get crisp and cinder, and had as lief burn. Sue-I have lived by this. It is the lingering emblem of the Heaven I once dreamed, and though if this is taken, I shall remain alone, and though in that last day, the Jesus Christ you love, re- mark he does not know me-there is a darker spirit will not dis- own it's [sic] child.</page><page sequence="21">424 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY Few have been given me, and if I love them so, that for idolatry, they are removed from me-I simply murmur gone, and the billow dies away into the boundless blue, and no one knows but me, that one went down today. We have walked very pleasantly-Perhaps this is the point at which our paths diverge-then pass on singing Sue, and up the distant hill I journey on. (173) Johnson has speculated that either "some disagreement on spiritual matters" or Dickinson's suspicion that Sue has been neglecting her may have occasioned the letter.'4 His sugges- tions do not go far enough, for he does not give sufficient weight to the importance of the link in Dickinson's mind be- tween her religious stance and the state of her friendships. It is clear from her correspondence that Dickinson took her friendship for Sue very seriously, and Sue, possibly sensing the latent idolatry of Emily's love, objected to such intense affection. The first three paragraphs, referring to an incident that ap- parently caused a rift between the two young women, associate this incident with others that had been an "agony." That Dickinson alludes to an earlier grief, perhaps sentimentally exaggerated, manifested at the death of a child to illustrate her present grief underscores the intense, emotional response prompted by her suspicion that Sue has not been constant. For human love, in its intensity and constancy, appears to be what she meant by "this" in the statement: "Sue-I have lived by this." In that case, love is the "emblem" or type or pledge of the heaven she "once Dreamed." Heaven then represents both her desire-for love-and what the father God has prom- ised inasmuch as the mention of Jesus Christ provides the ap- propriate religious context. In this light, the second half of the fourth paragraph, al- though not entirely clear, does make some sense. If love dis- appears from her life and if the Jesus Christ Sue loves denies knowing Dickinson at her death, there would still be someone or something-despair, Satan, or annihilation?-to claim her. 14 Letters, I, 307.</page><page sequence="22">EMILY DICKINSON'S REJECTION 425 Further, Dickinson seems to be suggesting that love's con- stancy and God's Fatherhood are causally connected. If she finds and retains love in this life, that love serves as a pledge that God is her father, and someone or something will step in and fill the father r6le for her. Dickinson's use of love's constancy as a test of the Heavenly Father's authenticity may have been part of the spiritual dis- agreement Johnson has suggested. For such an approach is ob- viously unorthodox. The Jesus Christ Sue Gilbert loves is the Christ of the orthodox tradition, the spokesman for the Heavenly Father. Accordingly, Dickinson intimates that, after Sue has expressed her love for Christ, He will then be willing to "know" her on judgment day as a daughter of His heavenly father. Emily Dickinson's use of love's constancy, however, implies that she desires that Christ reverse the order and first grant what she wants. Then she will love Him and believe. In the concluding paragraph Dickinson again alludes to her tendency to hoard her friends. More significantly, she hypoth- esizes that what she considers her relative lack of success in retaining her friends may be a punishment from God for lov- ing them too much and not wisely, that is, idolatrously. In- terestingly, an earlier letter, written in 1852, had expressed a similar thought but with one important difference. Then she remarks that she ought not be discontented-"but my heart wants more"-with the friends God has given her and the occasional difficulties she has encountered in loving them; otherwise, God may punish her by taking them away: ".... I think it may be wrong, and that God will punish me by taking you away; ..." (85). By 1854, however, she felt that God was indeed punishing her. Finally, the determination to go her own way is tempered in the last lines by a sense of resignation that God's "punishment" is part of the price she must pay for her independence. In summary, then, letter no. 173 reveals that at the time of its writing, Emily Dickinson, despite mis- givings and doubt, still was able to maintain confidence in the Heavenly Father and that a large part of this confidence was</page><page sequence="23">426 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY her presupposition that He was bound to assist her in gaining the "Heaven" she "once dreamed." The "golden Dream" which only implicitly encompassed friendship and love evolved into the "dear fancy" of 1852 that explicitly signified the Lover and Husband. By 1854, further- more, Dickinson was speaking of love as the emblem of the "heaven once dreamed" and, in doing this, was openly ac- knowledging love as a form of idolatry so strong that she was tempted to succumb. As her remarks to Samuel Bowles con- cerning the occasional superiority of the "Heaven in the hand" over the "Charms of the Heaven in the bush" bear out, the temptation persisted. Finally, in referring to love as the em- blem of the "heaven once dreamed," Dickinson was recogniz- ing that love was both the fulfillment of her golden dream and the dear fancy, and an unorthodox but effective substitute for conversion and its joys. When we examine the correspondence after 1854 to dis- cover how Emily Dickinson resolved the paradox of insisting that God the Father had to provide her the success in love that threatened to replace Him, we confront once more the ab- sence of letters composed during these years. However, we must remember that from the 1862 derogatory description of God as an eclipse, we can infer a resolution of the paradox contra the Heavenly Father's authenticity. Emily Dickinson, then, did not lose her faith in the ortho- dox deity worshipped by Amherst because she found abhor- rent certain dogmas associated with this God. There is reason to maintain, on the contrary, that, apprehending this God as her Father in Heaven, she expected Him to grant certain promises she felt He had made, and made their granting the test of His authenticity. Strange as it may seem, embarrassing as it may appear to us, the evidence of Dickinson's correspon- dence does suggest that one major reason for her rejection of the Heavenly Father was her conviction that He reneged in His promise to give her heaven, her "golden dream," her "dear fancy," all of which represented for Emily Dickinson her expectations of success in friendship and love.</page></plain_text>
