<plain_text><page sequence="1">VII.-NEW BOOKS. The Unique Status of Man. By HERBERT WILDON CARR. London, Macmillan &amp; Co., 1928. Pp. 213. 7s. 6d. Prof. Wildon Carr believes that any stick is good enough to beat Materialism with, and perhaps he is right in this. But when we find him passing lightly from one philosophical position to another, on the assump- tion that, because none of them are Materialism, they are all indifferently "'Idealism" (v. pp. 191-193), when, for instance he appears in the first part of Chapter V. as an upholder of some modern theories of physics, in the secend part of the same chapter as a Monadist, and in Chapter VI. as a Bergsonian, we must protest that these various positions, however incon- sistent each may be with Materialism, are no less inconsistent with one another. Prof. Carr's fundamental thesis is " that acti.vity is more original than inertia, that change is more fundamental than the thing which changes, that movement can generate immobility, but immobility cannot give rise to movement " (195). This is the negation of Materialism. The principle which the author wishes to see set in the place of the passive determina- tion of Matter is the spontaneous activity of Life. This general attitude is all we can venture toiattribute to Prof. Carr Ka' o'Xov; in considering its further implications, we have to distinguish between the different Prof. Carrs which appear in different chapters of the book. For Prof. Carr the Monalist (v. esp. 171-173) the real world is the organic world, since only what is individual is real, and individuality belongs to the living. Apparently every living organism ' wie es geht und steht' is individual and therefore one of the plurality of monads which constitute reality. The non-living world, on the contrary, " of inert material objects and mechanically determined events in space and time " is not "self-existent in its own right". "It is an aspect of the living universe, which varies for every constituent agent," for each of these monads has " its own inalienable outlook on the universe ". If we had to criticise this doctrine, we should protest against the arbitrary bisection of the universe at the wavering boundary between organic and inorganic. How can you assign to a sponge an absolute reality which you deny to a rock ? And what sort of " outlook on the universe " has a cabbage? And this criticism would suggest the second, that this whole doctrine of "windowed" monads, for which th3 material world is an "aspect," is meaningless unless we suppose that the principle of the monads (and therefore of reality) is not life at all but (at least) consciousness. But we are spared the necessity of such criticism, for we are given in the same chapter a second and inconsistent account of the material world. According to this, the discovery of the electrical structure of the atom in 1895 has broken down the conception of causal determination within the world of inert matter itself. " In the new conception of the electron the last stronghold of scientific malierialism is invaded " (166). The activity which produces the atom is "original and free," and Prof. Eddington is quoted with approval as saying that " all the determinism is removed from the laws of physics " (179). But then what becomes of the view of</page><page sequence="2">112 NEW BOOKS. inert matter as an " aspect "? Surely this " aspect " has become (since 1895) impossible for enlightened monads ? It seems rather that the in- organic world, in so far as it possesses in the electron its own principle of free activity, is placed on precisely the same plane of reality as the organic, and that the claim of the living world to be exclusively real is exploded (unless, indeed, the electron, besides being " free " and " active," is also alive). Again, there is obviously at least a primd facie incompatibility between such a Monadism and the Bergsonian doctrine of a transcendent life force. No attempt is made to mediate this contradiction, and yet it seems clear that, in so far as living beings are the vehicles or expressions of a life force, and only intelligible by reference to it (p. 187), whatever may have become of their ' individuality,' at least there is no longer any meaning in calling them ' monads '. But these are comparatively small matters. What must strike every- body about a theory which in any form makes Life its ultimate principle, is that the one thing which such a theory is by its very nature incompetent, to account for, is the Unique Status of Man; and Prof. Carr, to do him justice, consistently ignores this question until page 211. It is true that the attempt is made towards the end of the book to arrange the Universe in a hierarchy, according to degrees of freedom, with man at the top. This attempt would not of course, even rif successful, vindicate for man an " unique " status, and it is evident in any case that, in order to be success- ful, it presupposes a critical analysis of the concept of freedom. But for Prof. Carr anything and everything which is not causal determination is freedom. Thus (even if we ignore the electron) every living thing is free, simply in virtue of its being alive (plants, e.g., on p. 208, and the bee has "positive freedom," p. 187). It is clear that on this assumption any subsequent differentiation of the ground of freedom must be sheer dogma- tism. We are told for instance (p. 208) that the opening of a flower-bud is a responsive action, which implies essential freedom, but is not in- dividual free will, giving it power to decide whether it will open or not. We know that the ultimate test of philosophical truth is its agreemeht with common sense, but even so this is surely a curiously elaborate way of saying that vegetables grow but do not will. We have no space to do justice to the eponymous page 211-213. It is here asserted that the real uniqueness of the status of man consists in his escape from a material existence, " for which alone evolution appears to have provided," into a world of spiritual values, " which it would seem, the creative evolution had not even in view ". We have given our grounds for supposing that it is rather Prof. Carr's philosophy which "does not appear to have provided " for this other world. Perhaps we have carped too much. It may be that for the purpose of the conversion of materialists, which Prof. Carr appears to have mainly in view, the appeal to the principle of life is more effective than the appeal (e.g.) to the at least more adequate principle of mind. We must plead in excuse that the title, the preface, and the contents of the first chapter (" The theological form of the free-will problem ") pro- mised something very different. We were led to expect that the book would attempt to supply that need of an adequate analysis of the concept; of Freedom, which seems to have brought philosophy to a standstill (for a hundred years we have been faced by the absurdity of two freedoms!); but it has served only to emphasise the need. There are some inaccuracies: the " Phenomenology of Mind" was published in 1807, not 1805 (p. 119); and Hegel wrote no work entitled " The Philosophy of Mind" (p. 212). M. B.

Much of this able book is naturally too purely theological in character to interest the readers of this journal. But the opening chapters, in which a foundation of philosophy is laid and some fundamental conceptions are worked out very carefully, have a wider appeal. The question "what exactly we mean by speaking of a sacramental world, and how we are led thereby to conceive the nature of the events or things or rites called sacramental in the special sense" (p. 2), raises metaphysical issues of an important kind. Chapter L. treats of symbols and instruments, the difference yet inter- dependence of which is brought out with fresh insight. " Instrumentality is the special property of acts, extended to cover that with which action is performed. Significance is the special property of language, extended to cover all bhat is used as expressive " (p. 12). Two kinds of sacramentalism flow from special empha'sis on either of these concepts; " the theologian who thinks in terms of instrumentality will emphasise the truth that in some particular sacrament God really acts and does something; while he who thinks in terms of significance will teach rather that in particular sacraments God's universal presence and activity are more readily apprehended and made known" (p. 17). Two distinguishable thoughts of God are involved. Sacraments, to be wholesome, must take outward things as instruments or expressions of goodness. In the second chapter Mr. Quick deals with eesthetic sacramentalism, which operates with ideas of significance and expression. Beauty is goodness expressed. The purely projective theory of beauty is exposed, but without moralistic fallacy; there is no attempt to show that beauty simply is, or is simply for, moral goodness, yet the vital relation between beauty and moral value is set out with force and point. AEsthetic sacramentalism is that which builds on the conviction that wherever goodness is expressed in beauty we are in contact with the Divine nature permeating all space and time. Here the tendency is to interpret the being of God as a too static perfection. Chapter III. is devoted to the other great type, ethical sacramentalism. "Its fundamental concept is that of a Deity the power of Whose goodness is sufficient to convert into the instrument of His good purpose all the evil that there is, has been, or ever shall be, in the world " (pp. 48-49). For ethical sacramentalism the world is susceptible of change; the former type seeks not to change but to contemplate ever more truly. These two types of view are of course abstractions in the last resort, and each in the end is compelled to borrow from the other. Mr. Quick makes the penetrating observation that the apparent conflict between ethical and msthetic sacramentalism " turns out to be just one aspect of the ancient, all-pervading problem of the relation of eternity to time " (p. 52). He offers an artistic analogy which may body forth their reconciliation; and in general it will be felt by many readers that when he touches on questions of art his words are more than usually full of vivid delicate suggestion. If these first three chapters, treating of sacramentalism rather than of sacraments, are occupied, in Mr. Quick's own phrase, with' " the abstractionTs of metaphysic," they are at all events written with a vigorous and infectious interest that abstractions very seldom inspire. We now enter the specifically theological section of the book, and I can only indicate very generally how the writer goes on to apply the phil- osophical principles thus laid down. His primary object is to show that Christ's life is a sacrament in sensu eminenti. His own precise words are best. "To interpret the life of Jesus as the supreme sacrament is to 8</page><page sequence="4">114 NEW BOOKS. show that in this outward, historical life lived in space and time there is both uniquely expressed and uniquely operative the highest purpose of goodness which all life and all nature are destined to fulfil " (p. 57); " all divine goodness, as it comes into relation with our world, must be con- ceived either as expressed or as actively operative in it. All this divine self-expression is summed up in the Incarnation, and all this divine opera- tion in the Atonement " (p. 101). In the end, the world of space and time, having been made perfectly instrumental to God's purpose, itself enters the eternal whole in which His goodness is expressed. The defini- tion offered of sacramental realities is to the effect that "in them the outward consists of one member of a class or one part of a whole, which is severed and differentiated from the other members or parts, in order both to represent the true relation of the whole to God and to be means whereby this relation is more effectively realised'" (p. 105). This is not the place to explain at length how Baptism and the Eucharist are exhibited as falling under this definition. They are ritual acts, using a certain form and matter, which both represent a universal relation of human life to God through Christ, and also, in thus representing all life, make life worthy to be thus represented. Some doubt may perhaps be felt whether Mr. Quick leaves us free to distinguish as clearly as we must between instances of what has been broadly named " the sacramental principle "-which it is held justifies us in speaking of, e.g., a sunset as a sacrament-and that unshared moral and spiritual experience of Christ in death, the virtue of which (as the Church holds) is conveyed to faith in the Eucharist. I do not know that he would choose to differentiate one from the other as an imperfect from a perfect sacrament; but there are sentences which suggest that by a continuous advance of thought and meaning we may gradually pass up from things like a sunset, Sunday, or a' Church-building to Holy Com- munion. If, however, we regard spiritual experience as sui generis, it is not the likeness of the Eucharist to these lesser things that will strike us, but its unlikeness. But this is a point to be made very much less against Mr. Quick than against others, whose use of " the sacramental principle " has been, to employ a mild expression, inconsiderate. Most Christian thinkers will agree wholeheartedly with Mr. Quick's declaration that " sacraments are at once expressive symbols and effective instruments of spiritual realities and operations " (p. 218). And no one can read his general exposition of this view without a grateful apprecia- tion of his just and fine discernment, as also of his mastery in theological dialectic. In few books are thought and word so close-fitted to each other. Objections in the reader's mind tend to fade away as explanations cast light on the original statement. Thus the dictum that "sacramental grace elicits rather than inserts" might seem to render doubtful the position that in sacraments the initiative is with God, but the doubt could not eventually be sustained. I cannot think, however, that it is useful to give the phrase ex opere operato so unprecedentedly wide a meaning as is done on page 219. To me, I confess, the book is more completely satisfying in its, philosophy than its theology. Theologically it is in a real degree one-sided, inasmuch as the great type of Eucharistic thought which derives from Augustine, is powerfully expounded by Calvin, and finds a noble representative in the modern IR. W. Dale, is scarcely glanced at. Yet it has deeper affinities with New Testament thought than either of the two types here described as " Catholic " and " Free Church ". It is an omission which, grave as it may appear to some, will not prevent the book from taking rank as a luminous and distinctive exposition of the philosophy of sacraments. H. R.

In the sub-title, this little book is called " An Introduction to Ethical Philosophy," and in the Introductory chapter the author explains that his aim is " rather to stimulate the reading of more adequate books than to presuppose it ". One thing the author does seem to presuppose, however, is a keen interest in the problems of ethics, and the order of his chapters is designed 'to follow (roughly) what he has found to be a fairly common development of reflective minds. Chapter II. is devoted to a comparatively lengthy criticism of Hedonism. Then the leading ideas of Evolutionary Ethics are discussed and criticised, and Mr. Carritt next turns to examine Utilitarianism. His main point is that, making ' the greatest happiness of the greatest number ' the ' moral end,' and seekingf to base particular obligations on the idea of this end, the Utilitarian can make out a plausible case only by assuming what he professes to explain-particular obligations. In Chapter V., the author begins his criticism of the ' Idealists,' by discussing the theory called 'Perfectionism'. This theory is described in terms of its attitude to Utilitarianism. It begins by noting that "Utilitarianisma recognises a duty to give others a 'good '-pleasure. To do this duty is to be good, and must therefore be thq good of the agent. Ought we not to say, then, that the good (good will) which we choose for ourselves is that which we should give to others? " This and kindred notions are roundly condemned be- cause they are based on a confusion of different senses of the term 'good'. Thus we have circular definitions of ' morality' in terms of 'self- realisation '; and again, Green's doctrine (that our duties are to be defined as those acts which realise our self in its pursuit of a ' good common to itself and all others') is quite confused because it fails to distinguish different senses of the term ' common good'. In the latest form of the 'coherence theory of goodness' (as held, e.g., by Prof. Paton) " we have an attempt to bring moral philosophy into line with the Idealist theory that fact is created by thinking and consists in coherent thought. We are now told that goodness is created by willing and consists ultimately in coherent willing." In his interesting criticism of this theory, Mr. Carritt opens up an important discussion of what I can only describe to myself as 'the objectivity of right-ness '. But it is possible that even those who sympathise with his general criticisms will feel that the ' coherence' theory has a little more significance than Mr. Carritt will allow. In the chapter on 'Right and Good,' we are definitely introduced to a distinction between 'good' as applied to an act, and 'good' as applied to a state or event. In the former sense, its general meaning is ' right,' 'moral ' or 'virtuous'. In the latter, it means 'satisfies desire ' -(or ' what we should bring about in normal circumstances '). The author in- sists that we do not judge acts simply in terms of an end to be achieved. Yet if we cannot base duty on the idea of an end to be achieved, neither ,can we deduce duties from the mere idea of 'duty' or 'rightness,' the writer maintains in his criticism of Kant. But because he agrees that Kant was right in asserting that actual consequences and everything but motive are irrelevant to moral worth, he finds it necessary to distinguish between the 'right-ness ' and the 'morality' of an action. An action is right if it "brings about the due distribution of satisfactions ". An action is moral if the agent believes that it is 'right' and does it because of that belief. This distinction between ' rightness' and ' morality' is sound, but some may think that Mr. Carritt presses it too far in his distrust of subjectivism' in ethics, and 'convention' as the determining ground of</page><page sequence="6">116 NEW BOOKS. duties. And it is a similar fear of subjectivism and convention which makes him deny (in Chapter XI.) that rights depend on 'recognition,' whilst admitting that they arise only in society. The chapter on 'Moral Rules' is most stimulating and enlightening. Treating of the 'moral motive,' Mr. Carritt is quite clear that ' morality' is not 'prudence'. Rather, like Butler, he holds that while we may act from desire (impulse) or from prudence (cool self-love), there is yet a third kind of motive possible. If a person believe a thing to be riight, he can make that per- ceived rightness the determining ground or motive of his action. This of course raises the whole problem of Freedom in an acute forxn. Mr. Carritt abandons the mechanistic view, and also the self-determinist theory that ' virtue alone is free ' for this is simply an evasion of the whole ques- tion. His own view is that we can freely choose between what we desire and what we think right, although the alternatives between which we must choose are determined by character-in-circumstance. At the beginning of the book is an analysis of contents, and at the end a fairly short but good bibliography. The foregoing summary gives a list of the topics discussed. It gives no indication of the clear style and fidelity to the canons of good logic which make the book so worthy of our attention. Opinions will always differ as to the best kind of introduction to ethical philosophy, and it may be felt that the author has presupposed too great an intelligent interest in the normal beginner, and that he has rather under-estimated the amount of philosophy required for a proper appreciation of some of his arguments (par. 49, for example). But there sihould be no question as to the book's value for the advanced student. As a piece of philosophical analysis and criticism, by one who has trained himself to think cleanly and accurately, it appears to me altogether admirable. It is balanced and impartial in the best sense of those words, and yet does not simply present points of view. I feel fairly confident that, in commending this careful treatment of the most difficult questions in ethics, I am simply expressing what will become a general judgment on Mr. Carritt's book. W. D. LAMONT. Die Geltungs-Grundlagen Metaphysischer Urteile. By DR. HERMANN E. OBERHUBER. Ernst Reinhardt, Munich, 1928. Pp. 145. M. 4.50. The impossibility of arriving at agreement among themselves even on their most fundamental and elementary principles has long been a standing re- proach against metaphysicians. Dr. Oberhuber bases on his disagreement a relatively moderate and carefully defined scepticism. Metaphysics in his view can lay down the alternative possibilities; but it cannot decide between them on grounds which can ever be accepted as giving proof or even probability from an objective point of view, and it must therefore always take the form of series of alternative doctrines set in opposition to each other. This is connected with the fact that none of these alternatives are capable either of verification or refutation by experience; like Kant he will have no knowledge beyond the limits of possible experience. But, though metaphysical arguments can never prove a doctrine to all men, they can prove it to all who have certain presuppositions. For them, Dr. Ober- huber says, it is therefore certain knowledge; for others it is mere un- founded speculation. But there remains a common ground between these rival views, and it is the business of metaphysics to explore this. The common ground is simply the fact that the laws of logic admit a limited, definite number of alternative solutions to any problem, e.g. there must either be a God or no God, if there is a God he must either be identical</page><page sequence="7">NEW BOOKS. 117 with the world or quite different from it or inclusive of the world and yet more than the world, etc. Now, the author holds, as long as metaphysics confines itself to enumerating and making a system of these different pos- sibilities, it can legitimately claim universal validity; but not if it asserts a preference in favour of one alternative rather than the others. Assertions that one or other alternative is true he calls " Typothesen," apparently be- cause they are valid not universally but only for all minds of a certain type. These "Typothesen " are logically unjustifiable but rest on a particular valuation, which may be confined to a few people at a given time or may colour the whole outlook of a civilisation, as the valuation given by the Middle Ages to the concept of God and by modern times to the concept of cause. For the people who hold this valuation, however, they give truth and even certainty. The author seems here to have confused two senses of valua- tion, the regarding of something as very good and the regarding of something as very important in the world. It is the second, not the first, kind that constitutes the main difference between rival systems of metaphysics, and this, though it may be influenced by the first, is not an assigning of values at all in the strict sense but a belief about what is thought to be a fact, e.g., to believe that the universe is a causally determined system is to believe not that causality has great value, but that it is in fact very important, i.e., all-pervasive. He also does not make clear what he means by saying that a metaphysical dogma is true for some, not for others. If he merely means that they think it true, that falls under the psychology of error; if it can really be true in some sense for some people and not for others he should explain what that sense is, and further he is assuming a subjectivist view of knowledge, which is itself a particular metaphysical theory. The book is certainly a very able production, and its argument results in as tenable a version of metaphysical agnosticism as I have seen. But the main ground given for this conclusion is still the old one that nietaphysi- cians disagree. Yet surely this disagreement is quite compatible with some of their arguments being right; what is really a valid argument may easily not be accepted by many people through preconceptions or misunderstand- ing, where the subject is so difficult. He also argues that the judgments of metaphysics are all material, not formal, and therefore, apparently, all, in the absence of a confirming experience, unjustified. -But, apart from the fact that neither the premiss nor the conclusion of this argument would apply to, e.g., the principle that reality must be self-consistent, he should not exclude without discussion the possibility of material implication, the pos- sibility that certain concepts, in virtue of their specific nature and not only of the laws of logic, can be found to involve others. Neither is it so easy as he thinks to avoid metaphysics and leave our other knowledge standing. Experience may confirm our theories as to the past and present, but it can- not without some metaphysical assertions, at least about the orderly nature of the world, justify us in ever predicting the future, which we have not experienced. But as a compact sketch of the view in question, the book is most ably done, though it might have given a better show of reasons and is somewhat too abstract in its method of exposition. A. C. EwnGm.

This annual is as useful as ever for its full bibliography and abstracts of the psychological books and articles published during the year. Almost 700 of its 900 pages are devoted to this purpose. The remaiaing 200 pages contain six original papers and five shorter notes.</page><page sequence="8">118 NEW BOOKS. The first paper (Les proble'mes de la perception et la psycho-physiologie) by the editor, Prof. Henri Pieron, continues the studies with which he has enriched several past issues, by a theoretical discussion of some of the problems of perception, with particular reference to Pavlov's ' con- ditioned reflex' and the Gestalt psychology. He maintains that if we confront the conditioned reflex theory with the phenomena of perception we find that Pavlov has oversimplified the actual facts. There is a 'syncretic plasticity' in perception which enables us to recognise such and such an object under conditions the mnost various, and this cannot be taken account of when we analyse into pure sensations and reflexes. Illusions show the nature of perception most clearly. Especially do they show the part played by the general subjective attitude. The facts, how- ever, do not require the explanation which the Gestalt psychologists offer. The second paper (La qualitt du travail mental et les lois de l'exercice et de la fatigue) by M. Foucault describes experiments on practice and fatigue, continuing studies already published in L'Annee Psychologique, Journal de Psychologie, and Revue Philosophique. Theedxperiments were carried out by the performance of the arithmetical operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with numbers of one or two digits. Two methods of working were employed-with and without rest. The main conclusion at which the author arrives is that " when intelligence intervenes in muscular activity, such as that which consists in the writing of figures, it introduces there practice and fatigue, and these new factors in the work manifest themselves in a degree proportional to the extent to which intellectual activity is involved." There are two papers on mental testing. The first of these by Decroly (Essai d'application du test de Ballard dans les ecoles belges)- gives an account with results of the application of Ballard's Group Test-the French translation is given in an appendix-to over 7000 Belgian primary school children, with the object, on the one hand, of discovering whether the test in question is suitable for Belgian children, and, on the other hand, of determining norms for the different groups of children constituting the school population of Belgium. Some slight alterations in the wording of some of the test questions are proposed, and it is suggested that detailed instructions for the giving of the tests should be provided, but on tho whole Decroly is satisfied with the test, and he claims that it yields important data relative to the differences' between children from different linguistic areas, economic regions, and social classes. The whole paper is of great interest. The second paper is by Mme. Pi6ron on the " Scaling of an Intelligence Test for Vocational Guidance ". The test discussed consists of seven parts-7 questions involving number series, 8 questions involving relations of ideas, 3 questions involving analogies and opposites, 4 questions involving syllogisms, 4 questionus in*olving absurdities, 4 questions involving alternatives (after Burt), and 2 questions involving in- terpretation. These 32 questions have been selected from 95 which have been tried, and the whole arranged in a single test which may be given in half an hour. One of 'the remaining papers discusses the results of an investigation carried out by Mlle. Janina Budkiewicz on " les processus de, mesure spatiale line'aire," the object of which was to compare the different methods of estimating linear space, and to discover the psychological mechanisms underlying the estimation. The investigation is described in great detail, with the introspections of the subjects. The methods of estimation employed were: (1) division of a given length into 2, 3, 4, 6, and 10 equal parts, where the division is dependent on kinmesthetic sensations, (2) where the division is dependent on tactual sensations, (3) where the division is dependent on visual sensations. The first method,was found to give the</page><page sequence="9">NEW BOOKS. 119 least accurate, the last the most accurate estimation. The other paper (Le determinisme endocrinien du comportement psycho-sexuel chez les qattinaces) by M. A. Pezard, discusses the changes, anatomical, physio- logical, and psychological, produced by castration and ovariectomy of fowls, and by the grafting of testicular or ovarian tissue. These papers are followed by five short notes: (1) " Arrangement for the demonstration of the conditions of medial and lateral localisation of sounds" by B. Bourdon, (2) " Latent time and the intensity of light sensations" by H. Pi6ron, (3) "The law connecting the difficulty and the magnitude of tasks in theory and in practice" by H. Pieron, (4) " Statistical study of the variability of reaction times " by A. Fessard, (5) " Some correlations relative to technical aptitudes and vocational capacities " by A. Toltchinsky. All these notes are interesting, and the volume as a whole is a very important one. J. DREVER. Development of Hindu Polity and Political Theories. By NARAYAN CHAND6RA BANDYOPADHYAYA, M.A., Lecturer, Calcutta University. R. Cambray &amp; Co., Calcutta. 1927. This book is divided into six books each of which contains a number of sectibns. The earlier books are devoted to anthropological discussions regarding Indo-Iranian contact and Aryan and Dravidian ethnic environ- ments and socio-economic and political organisations. It also discusses in these earlier books the corporate and political organisations in Vedic and Post-Vedic times. On these subjects there have been many other works and, except for the general method of approach and a few points of minor importance, it has not much to say. But in its sixth book it has done an important service in emphasising the transcendental -ideal of Dharma as influencing political thought, which so far as I know has most often been ignored. "The concept of Dharma" is, as the author says, "t unique in the history of Indian intellectual and moral progress and con- noted, as it does even now, a world of ideas from the primary principles guiding human conduct to the ideal state of moral self-realisation so far as the individual is concerned. In its wider sense it embraced the totality of principles and precepts which conduce best to the happiness of men in this life and that beyond ". But he should have also said that the Dharma is conceived in certain important branches of Indian philosophy as a trans- cendent and mysterious power which regulates all mundane and natural events and that this power which thus regulates all worldly events behaves itself like a brute power which, however, is very intimately connected with specific ways of human conduct; those actions which affect or direct the Dharma power adversely to human interests, individually or socially, are called Adharma and those which affect it favourably to human interests are called Dharma. The goodness or badness of human actions whether they be taken ethically, socially or politically, depends on their actually affecting the direction of Dharma favourably or unfavourably to human interests. Goodness or badness of actions ethically, socially or politically, is therefore unalterably and definitely fixed according to the brute law of Dharma. The code of political actions is also as definitely fixed as is the code, of moral laws. According to this view political or social behaviour or conduct does not depend on prudential or Hedonistic considerations and it cannot change according to change of circumstances. What is good to-day should be good always and what is bad to-day is bad always, for the brute law of Dharma and Adharma knows no compromise simply because these laws are immutable in their nature. All caste laws and other customs fall</page><page sequence="10">120 NEW BOOKS. within the scope of this immutable Dharma. This principle of Dharma largely influenced the conceptions of ethical and political obligation in India; and, though Mr. Bandyopadhyaya has not properly investigated this question, he has at least pointed his finger in this direction and has emphasised this conception, and he is probably the first to do so in this field. He has also rightly combated the theory held by many writers that in ancient India kingship was regarded as a divine institution, and that the holder of the regal office was regarded as a god. He has shown that the passaves which gave rise to the idea that kingship was regarded as a divine institution have been wrongly interpreted by other writers and that these passages arose out of an elaboration of sacerdotalistic traditions. On these two points at least the book suggests a new line of investiga- tion and clears away some misconceptions. On a number of other points the book has supplied some new facts which are very useful. The writer is well acquainted with Sanskrit and can handle the texts propeply. We hope that Mr. Bandyopadhyaya will carry his investigations a step further in the proposed second volume of his work. S. N. DASGUPTA. Ideas and Ideals. By HASTINGS RASHDALL. Selected by H. D. A.

The book, however, is not the less useful on that account; and it proves, in a very impressive way, the range of Dr. Rashdall's accomplishments as a scholar, historian, moralist, theologian, and philosopher. In all these papers Dr. Rashdall shows himself a masterly writer of forcible and lucid English, and in all of them he is uniformly his candid, cool, contentious, clear and clever self. The title " Ideas and Ideals " indicates the temper and something of the subject matter to be found in the volume, since it suggests both his philosophical idealism and his seriousness in all matters of morals and of conscience. The subjects dealt with include the rights of State, Church, and Individual, The Idea of Progress, The Validity of " Religious Experience," " Modernism " (in relation to Liberal Theology), The Scholastic Theology, and F. H. Bradley's metaphysical system. Reviews of Newman's Life and of Tyrell's Autobiography indicate Dr. Rashdall's attitude to the Romwn Church. It is impracticable here to attempt to enter into the varied detail of these notable and stimulating essays. Instead I shall confine myself to a single point in ethics. In the essay on "The Rights of the Individual " Dr. Rashdall contends that the principle "Every one to count for one, and nobody for more than one" is rational and self-evident, and that the (non-hedonistic) utili- tarianism which he advocates in ethics ought to be interpreted in the light of this principle. Granting, however, that the principle may be consistent with the endeavour after maximum good, it is at any rate distinct from the latter and is not in any sense peculiarly utilitarian. Here, I think, the author tends to blur theoretical issues, but let us consider the conclusion he draws. This is the doctrine that Equality of Consideration is a funda- mental moral right for every one but that Equality of Opportunity-(in so far as this may be humanly contrived) is not.</page><page sequence="11">NEW BOOKS. 121 On the abstract point, it is surely immensely doubtful whether Equality of Consideration can be shown when Equality of Opportunity (as far as it is in anyone's power) is denied; and this abstract difficulty does not seem to be softened by Dr. Rashdall's contentions in detail. The gist of his argument is that any rational man would rather write books, plan bridges, settle disputes in the courts, etc., than perform the functions of the collar- less classes; that the ability to perform these higher, more lucrative and more attractive functions is pretty widely disseminated in society; that society must therefore discourage many who are able to perform these functions from performing them; and that, since, as a general rule, a man does best when he follows his father's footsteps, families should be encouraged to follow the family tradition and discouraged (in many cases) from surmounting the tradition. In other words, qud member of a family, each is not to count as one, but there is to be discrimination for and against. This seems an odd kind of Equality of Consideration. JOHN LAIRD.

III., Moyen Age et Renaissance, pp. 523-791. Paris: Alcan. 1928. Frs. 20. The revival of philosophical studies in Italy, due chiefly to Croce and Gentile, is calling forth an abundance of relevant literature. Of general histories Windelband's worlk has been translated, Fiorentino's compendium has been reprinted and completed with a supplementary volume, and Prof. de Ruggiero, besides having published a brief outline, has in hand a de- tailed study of which five volumes have so far appeared. Prof. Lamanna's two slim volumes differ by being frankly of the text-book order. The material is arranged in numbered and entitled paragraphs, and each chapter is followed by a full summary together with a bibliography which, except for sources, confines itself entirely to books in Italian and French. Despite the enforced schematism the presentation becomes at times fluid and living through the agility and sporadic insight characteristic of the Neo-Latin mind. The section on Greek philosophy follows the usual lines; that on the philosophy of Christianity is more independent and may be read with considerable profit by those who, while not anxious to delve deeply into the subject, would like to supplement and correct the sadly antiquated accounts that linger on in our English histories. The third fascicule of Prof. Brehier's large survey (the first two were reviewed in these pages in October last by Prof. A. E. Taylor) should find -a wide and warm welcome, and the remaining three, which are to carry the survey to the present century, will be awaited with interest. It would be impertinent to expatiate on the competence of a scholar who has long en- joyed a wide reputation, but I may at least mention that his editorship of the new Revue d' Histoir e de la Philosophie enables him to utilise and draw attention to the latest contributions. The bibliographies of the mediaeval period are both select and up-to-date; the one of the Renlaissance, how- ever, is scarcely satisfactory-Hdffding and perhaps Fischer should have been mentioned, and some recent Italian works have escaped notice, not- ably the important series of volumes published by the Istituto di Studii</page><page sequence="12">122 NEW BOOKS. Vinciani (Rome) on Leonardo da Vinci, on whom Prof. Brehier writes a virtually empty page. If I may indulge a respectful complaint, I confess that the part dealing with the crucial stage of medieval philosophy, richly instructive though it is, tends at times to become a mere summary of treatises rather than the synthetic interpretation and clear historical evaluation of the thinkers concerned.
