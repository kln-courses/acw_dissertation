But the general tenor of the context makes it clear that the mention of two separate divinities, Indra and Brhaspati, is intended here. Moreover, in no sense can brhaspati be regarded as a distinctive epithet of Indra ( in the way in which urukrama can be of Visnu ). 2 A V XIX. 9. 6 ; VS 36.9; TA 7.1.1; TU 1.1.1; 12.1; Man SS 6. 1.5Ě</page><page sequence="2">2 Annals BORI, LXX ( 1989 ) (moral) order established by the 'binder' god Varuna and his two alter egos Mitra and Aryaman ; in the third quarter, the phase of the mythologi- zation of history as represented by Indra and of the purposeful concoction of his counterpart Brhaspati ; and in the fourth quarter, the phase of the hiérarchisation of popular religious cults as symbolized by Visnu. It may be presumed - and this presumption gets adequate confirmation from the history of later Hinduism - that independent religious sects grew round these Vedic gods, namely, Varuna, Indra, Brhaspati, and Visnu. A mutual con- frontation among these religious sects was also inevitable - and, indeed, understandable. Therefore, in order to avoid any probable schism within the Vedic religion that might arise out of such confrontation, the Vedic seers in- troduced into their evolutionary mythology the concept of dual-divinities and thereby sought to establish a kind of rapprochement among these religious sects, based mainly on the principles of complementary ness, conciliatory adjustment, and hiérarchisation. Let me begin by stating some of the principal tenets of what I under- stand by " evolutionary Rgvedic mythology " : ( 1 ) The Rgvedic mythology cannot be said to have assumed a finite and finished form at any given moment. It would, therefore, be wrong to study that mythology as if it was a static phenomenon. Rgvedic mythology had been, throughout, reacting and responding to the various vicissitudes in the cultural history of the Rgvedic age. (2) A particular Vedic god is seen to have been dominant in a particular period, because the personality and character of that god adequately reflected the ethos of that period. ( 3 ) Even after a Rgvedic god had been conceived, his character did not remain unchanged. His personality, as it were, 4 grew ' - it often assumed a heterogeneous character on account of the different elements which came to be assimilated into it in conformity with the mythological ideology which had been undergoing constant modification. ( 4 ) The relationships among the various Rgvedic gods were governed by certain culture-historical compulsions. The concepts of some of the principal dual- divinities, for instance, have originated out of such compulsions. Before I proceed, let me make it clear that I am not going to examine critically the views of other scholars regarding the topics which I shall be dealing with in the course of my lecture today. I have already done so at great length elsewhere.3" I shall take for granted my own views in this regard and shall endeavour to set them forth in a new frame-work. Further I shall '» Dandekar, Vedic Mythological Tracts, Delhi 1979.</page><page sequence="3">Dandekar : Reflections on Vedic Mythology 3 be taking into account mainly the original characters of the Vedic gods who form the subject-matter of my discourse and not the subsequent development of their personalities. While the Proto- Aryans, that is to say the common ancestors of the Vedic Aryans and the Iranian Aryans, had been living together, presumably in the region round about Balkh, their language and religious ideology may be said to have received their initial distinctive characterisation. In that early epoch, the ancient Vedic Aryans are known to have lived in close proxi- mity to - indeed, as a part and parcel of - nature. Like many other peoples, they were struck by the vastness, brilliance, and bounty of nature. But in their case, the mythological concept arising out of this experience, like, for instance, that of the Father Sky and the Mother Earth, seems to have had its growth arrested. For, the ancient Vedic Aryans had become fascinated by another characteristic of the natural phenomena. They realized that nature, though vast, was by no means unplanned and unregulated. It was governed by some definite law. In other words, it was not chaos ; it was comsos. This realization gave rise to the mythological concepts of Rta, the cosmic law,3 and Varuna, the administrator of that cosmic law. Varuna accomplishes the stupendous feat of establishing and sustaining the cosmic order Rta, because he is asura . The word asura is made up of the noun asu and the possessive termination ra, thus yielding the sense ť possessor of asu At an early stage in the evolution of human thought, man believed that a cosmic, magically potent, fluid permeated through all the aspects of creation and thereby invested them with the capability of being and becoming. In the Vedic parlance, this magical potence came to be called asu . Varuna is preeminently asura - the possessor of asu par excellence } The colossal power which Varuna derives in virtue of his being asura is called mãyãf which word etymologically means the incomprehensible capacity to plan and organize something which is beyond the intelligence and powers of man. It is, indeed, from this point of view that Varuna is called yaksin ,6 the awe-inspiring miracle-working magician. How does Varuna manage to control and regulate the working of the universe - both in its phenomenal and human aspects ? How does he be- come dhrtavrata , the sustainer of laws - the samrãj or the world-sovereign whose ordinances are inexorable even for gods ? The etymology of the word 3 Cf.

I derive the word varunä from the root vr which means ' to bind ' Varuna is basically the * binder ' god who controls and regulates all the happenings in the universe - cosmic as well as human - by binding down their operators. The famous pãsas or fetters of Varuna may be said to serve a double purpose - on the one hand, working in a subtle intangible manner ( setrbhir arajjubhih )7 they hold down the various entities in the universe in their proper places and thereby ensure their integrated functioning, and, on the other, they are employed by Varuna, the guardian of the cosmic-ethical order, as instruments of punishment to the perpetrators of druh or anrta. So far as the Rgvedic mythology is concerned, the mythological con- cepts of Mitra and Aryaman must be said to represent a sort of an extension of the Varuna-concept. They are minor and late. In the Rgveda there is only one whole hymn which is addressed exclusively to Mitra.8 A critical study of that hymn and a few other references to Mitra would make it clear that, in the view of Vedic poets, Mitra's personality had no physical basis whatsoever. I think that the initial words of the Mitra-hymn, mitro janãn yãtayati bruvãnah - " Mitra, through his commands, sets people in their proper places " - express the true character of that god. Mitra is yãtayaj- jana ,9 and his main function is to control, regulate, and direct the affairs of men. The word mitra also, like the word varuna , is derived from a root which means ť to bind ' The original nominal derivative mitram (neuter) means a bond - later, a bond of friendship ; and Mitra ( masculine ) is the name given to the god who establishes such bonds among the people and organizes them more particularly in the moral sense. The fact that the concept of mitra is connected with the concepts of dharma and rta10 would confirm that god Mitra represents the personification of an ethical-moral abstraction. One, indeed, gets the impression that the Rgvedic Mitra has been conceived as a sort of alter ego of Varuna. Mitra is in relation to the affairs of men what Varuna is in relation to the cosmic phenomena. The function of Aryaman, who too, in a way, shares the basic character of Varuna, is still more restricted in scope. He regulates the relationships of the Vedic people with ' strangers ' - mostly in an amicable manner. The second important period in the age of the Rgveda was marked by the migration and victorious onward march of the Vedic Aryans from the * RV VII. 84. 2. « #7111.59. 9 RV III. 59. 5 ; VIII. 102. 12. w #V V. 81. 4 ; VIIT. 52. 3 ; X. 8. 4.</page><page sequence="5">Dandekař : Reflections on Vedic Mythology 5 region round about Balkh, where they had lived for a pretty long time, to- wards Saptasindhu or the land of the seven rivers ( roughly covering the north, western portion of the Indo-Pakistan subcontinent) and their subsequent colonization in Saptasindhu and beyond. I believe that the religio-mytholo- gical ideology of a people is often determined by the way of life and thought of that people. While the ancient Vedic Aryans lived with an overwhelming feeling of awe for the cosmic order, it was but natural that their religion and mythology should have been dominated by the concepts of Rta and Varuna. As against this, in the new phase of their cultural life, which I have just indicated, the Vedic Aryans were mainly required to encounter various forms of opposition and obstruction -vrtrâni - both natural and human. They, therefore, sought for a new kind of religion - a religion which would be consistent with their new way of life. People on the war-path needed a war- god to inspire and bless them. This is briefly how Vrtrahã Indra came to be • born ' in the Rgvedic pantheon, and how, soon after he had been born, he became the foremost among the Rgvedic gods - yo jata èva prathamaK 11 Numerous Rgvedic references would make it clear that originally Indra was not a god, but that he attained god-head through his own achieve- ments. It is noteworthy that the Rgvedic poets have not emphasized the human traits, in form and character, of any other god to the extent to which they have done of Indra. Descriptions such as that Indra had long arms, a well-shaped chin, golden hair and beard, etc., are indeed so realistic that out of them unmistakably emerges the picture of a blonde Aryan hero. But what perhaps makes the humanness of Indra's personality most self-evident are the glimpses which the Vedic poets have given us into what may be called the human weaknesses of that god. Indra's extreme fondness of Soma, his peculiar interest in women, the replenishment of his virile power through the intervention of vrsãkapi , the unusual war-fright which he experienced on one occasion, his skirmishes with his valiant troops Maruts who were normally loyal to him - all such references would imply that the human elements in Indra's personality were really basic and essential and not merely the result of the anthropomorphisation of a natural phenomenon. Verily, Indra was a human hero, who was characterised by some human weaknesses, but who, at the same time, possessed the capacity for superhuman exploits. The most basic theme of the Indra-mythology is Indra's victory over Vrtra. One of the most exclusive epithets of that god is vrtrahã - conqueror il BV II. 12. 1.</page><page sequence="6">6 Ànnals BORI LXX ( 1989 ) and destroyer of Vftra. And in this very epithet lies the secret of the eleva- tion of the human hero to godhead. The Rgvedic references to Vftra har&lt;Jly produce the impression of any specific personality. The word vrtra ( neuter ; usually plural vrtrãni ) originally implied any form of resistance or opposi- tion. This impersonal concept was sometimes personified in the form of demon Vftra (masculine) after the historically authentic hero Indra had been transformed into a mythological divinity. Etymologically considered, if Vftra was resistance incarnate, Indra ( connected with the word nara ) was virility incarnate. I have, all along, been emphasizing the fact that the original character of Indra was that of a historically authentic human hero. It must not, however, be supposed that all the exploits ascribed to Indra by the Vedic poets were actually accomplished by that particular individual. For, when history is transformed into mythology, an individual is corresponding- ly transformed into an institution. In other words, after the mythological deification of the historical human hero Indra, all conceivable exploits - histo- rical or otherwise - came to be attributed to him. It is the period of the warlike adventures of the Vedic Aryans and their subsequent conquests and colonization under the victorious leadership of Indra, which is largely reflected in the Rgveda. This explains why the Rgvedic mythology is so conspicuously Indra-dominated. Bfhaspati-Brahmanaspati ( I take the two divinities, Bjrhaspati and Brahmanaspati, to be identical ) obviously owes his origin to the tendencies which were inevitably engendered by the Indra-dominated mythology. In a sense, therefore, this god may be said to belong conceptually to the second phase of the evolutionary mythology of the- Rgveda. Various views have been put forth regarding the personality and character of Bfhaspati-Brahma- naspati. Roth sees in him the personification of the activity of the holy men with respect to the gods. According to Oldenberg, Bfhaspati represents the deification of the efficaciousness of the mantras or magically potent prayers. Max Müller, who is generally followed by Macdonell, identifies him with Agni, while Hillebrandt, who, incidentally, on account of his unmistakable bias towards moon-gods, is often referred to as Mond-mytholog, thinks that he is a moon -god. It is also suggested, by Zimmer, for instance, that Bfhaspati is a deified ancient seer. Bergaigne seems to agree with this view, but he rejects the suggestion that Bjhaspati is a pure abstraction. Weber and Hopkins regard that god as priestly abstraction of Indra. In recent years, Gonda has understood Bjrhaspati-Brahmanaspati to be the lord of the power in brahman , while Hans-Peter Schmidt has drawn attention to tfee various</page><page sequence="7">DandekàR : Reflections on Vedic Mythology 7 aspects of that goďs personality - for instance, as epithet of Indra, as priest, as an independent god in general, and, more specifically, as a heroic god. Brhaspati is celebrated in eleven entire hymns of the Rgveda , while in two hymns ( IV. 49, VII. 97 ) he forms a dual-divinity with Indra. Though some kind of distinction appears to have been made between Brhaspati and Brahmanaspati in Vedic ritual and ancillary Vedic texts,12 the two words are used almost indiscriminately in the Rgveda . Etymology also seems to suggest the identity of the two gods.13 Incidentally it may be noted that only one name, namely Brhaspati, is generally retained in later literature. Rgvedic refe- rences to Bjrhaspati clearly indicate that he has by no means grown out of naturalistic mythology. Nor is he an outcome of the mythologization of a historical human personality. Again the suggestion that brhaspati was ori- ginally an epithet of Indra and was later separated from him and established as an independent god does not seem to be warranted. There is no indica- tion in the Rgveda of this kind of evolution of his personality - he already appears as a full-fledged independent god in that Veda as is clearly testified by II. 24. 11-13. At the same time, there can hardly be any doubt that he is a later addition to the Vedic pantheon. The facts that Brhaspati has no Indo-European or Indolranian cognates, that his name is artificially coined as a compound with pati as the latter member, that the hymns relating to him rarely contain any internal repetitions, and that sometimes a suspicion is expressed regarding the genuineness and originality of his personality14 would seem to confirm such an assumption. The over-all impression that one might form in the light of what has been said so far would be that Brhaspati was a deliberate artificial mytholo- gical creation, that he was conceived at some later stage in the evolution of the Rgvedic mythology to serve some specific function. Without discussing the various aspects of the personality and character of Brhaspati, I shall address myself to only one question : why did Brhaspati come to be introduced in Vedic mythology ? It has been already pointed out that the changed conditions in the life of the Proto-Indo-Aryans necessitated a transition from the cosmic-ethical phase of the Rgvedic mythology to the Indra-dominated heroic phase.

History came to be mythologised, and as the result of it the victorious warlike leader of the Vedic Aryans was ' born ' in the Vedic pantheon as Indra and forthwith became the foremost among the gods - y o jata èva prathamo manasvãn ,15 This naturally eventuated in the general glorification of the cult of military prowess. The socio-religious repercussions of the newly evident domineering stance of the cult of militarism against priestcraft - of Ksatra against Brahman - are seen to have been reflected in several Vedic passages. In Rgveda X. 109, for instance, there is a reference to brahmajãyã, the wife of a priest, having been kid- napped.16 The same topic is dealt with at greater length in Atharvaveda V. 17. That hymn contains a clear threat that the kidnapped wife of a Brahman is fearful and causes great disaster.17 It is hinted that there will be nothing but sheer misfortune in the kingdom in which a Brahman's wife is kept away from him.18 Atharvaveda V. 18 refers to the robbing of a Brahman of his cow. " Her it is said, " the gods did not give thee for thee to eat, o king; do not thou, o Räjanya, desire to devour the cow of the Brãhmana, that is not to be eaten ",19 The degraded military potentate becomes addicted to dice, is evil and self-ruined, who eats up the Brahman's cow, for, he only thinks: let me live today; I don't care for the morrow - adya jívõrti mõ švah.so He forgets that the Brahman, like fire, is not to be harmed by one who holds himself dear, for, Soma is Brahman's heir and Indra his protector against imprecations.21 We are told that the military rulers, Vaitahavyas, who usurped the Brahman's cow ( that is, the Brahman's belongings ), perished. e8 Elsewhere it is reported that the Sfñjaya-Vaitahavyas, who prospered excessi- vely, who just did not quite touch up the sky ( nodiva divam aspršan ), having molested the Brahman, Bhrgu, suffered utter mortification.23 Those who spat upon a Brahman, we are further told, or who sent theij mucus at him - they sit in the midst of a stream of blood, devouring hair.24 A king who thinks himself formidable and who desires to exploit a Brahman - his kingdom is laid waste where a Brahman is scathed.25 The derisive attitude of the Pajras towards Bfhaspati26 may also be mentioned as being indicative of the growing Brahman-Ksatra antagonism.

Reflections on Vedic Mythology 9 counteracting such militarist arrogance. Passively, the Vedic poet-priests used to insist that, in order to prove efficacious, the military prowess ( as symbo- lized by Indra ) had to be supplemented by the magically potent mantra . For instance, the credit for the victory of Sudãs in the War of the Ten Kings ( Dašarajna ) is said to have largely belonged to Vasistha ( Sudãs' Purohita ) who, through his mantra- power, had brought about Indra's intervention in Sudãs' favour.27 When, in that war, the Tftsu-Bharatas had become dis- rupted and weak, their Purohita, Vasistha, assumed the leadership and goaded his patrons on to victory.28 Elsewhere it is said : O Indra-Varuna, invulner- ably you overpowered Bheda by means of your deadly weapons and thus aided Sudãs in the Dãsarãjfia battle; for, you listened to the magically potent prayers of the Bharatas even in the midst of the urgent rival-invocations. In all this, indeed, there clearly became evident the supreme efficacy of the priestcraft of the Tjrtsu-Vasisthas - satyã trtsünäm abhavat purohitihP The other step in this process of asserting the claim of priestcraft by the side of - or, in some cases, even against - military prowess was more positive. A veritable new god was conceived anďcame to be introduced in Vedic mytho- logy - namely, Bjrhaspati-Brahmanaspati, the lord of brahman , of mantra - power and priestcraft. Understandably, there was little anthropomorphism in the make-up of this god - the ť function ' aspect of this god was definitely more prominent than the ť individuality ' aspect. It is emphasised that that king alone would, indeed, prevail over his adversaries who held Brhaspati in high esteem and regard.30 Brhaspati is the sage of sages ( kavim kavlnam), the supreme king of prayers ( jyestharãjam brahmanãm ).31 He promotes the yoking of devotion, and without him sacrifice does not succeed.32 As a path- maker he makes good the access to the feast of the gods.33 He awakens the gods with sacrifice.34 Wise gods themselves attain their share in sacrifice through mighty Brhaspati ; he is the creator of all magically potent mantras. Whoever makes offerings unto him will never be subjected to suffering; but of the Brahman-hater he is a veritable scourge.35 Verily, Brhaspati is the most godly of the gods ( devãnãm devatama ).36 Besides such conventional glorification of Brhaspati, attempt seems to have been deliberately made to present that god as being on par with Indra, the victorious warlike hero who had become the foremost among the Vedic a* $v VII. 33. 3. 28 BVV II. 33. 6. 20 RV VII. 83. 4. «o RV IV. 50. 7-9. #yil.23.1. 32 Rv I. 18. 7. *8 ÇV II. 23. 6-7. 34 AV XIX. 63. 1.

Brhaspati Ãngirasa, the first-born holy one, cleaver of rocks, roars as a bull at the two worlds, slays vrtras, shatters forts, overcomes foes.37 No one can overcome him in great fight or small.38 He is to be invoked in combats,39 and is a priest much praised in conflict.40 Brhaspati shares with Indra the epithets vajrin ( wielder of the bolt),41 maghavan ,42 and somapã .':ï He is sometimes represented as the companion and ally of Indra,44 but, what is far more significant, Brhaspati is individually credited with great heroic exploits in the celebrated Vala-myth. The mountain is said to have yielded to Bfhaspati's splendour when he opened the cowstall. Accompanied by his singing host, he rent Vala with a roar and, shouting, drove out the lowing cows. He won treasures and the great stalls full of cows ; the irresistible Bfhaspati slew his foe with flames.45 Bfhaspati's conquest of Vala was regarded to be so characteristic that it almost became proverbial.46 There can hardly be any doubt that such warlike character was tenden- tiously superimposed on Brhaspati. Indeed, in their enthusiasm for counteract- ing the ascendancy of the Ksatra-power over the Brahman-power, the Vedic myth-makers went to the other extreme. Indra's role, even in warlike explo- its, is sometimes said to have been secondary to that of Bfhaspati.47 Presu- mably, therefore, in order to avoid a new impending conflict between the Brahman-cult and the Ksatra-cult, the evolutionary Vedic mythology conceiv- ed the dual-divinity Indrãbfhaspati, who is celebrated in the two whole hymns, RV IV. 49 and VII. 97. It needs to be emphasized that the Rgveda-Samhitã, as we have it today, does by no means constitute the entire literature which had been pro- duced in the Rgvedic age. Nor can the Rgveda claim to reflect the life and thought of all the strata of the Rgvedic community. For instance, the sects, which had developed round Varuna-Mitra-Aryaman and Indra and Bfhaspati and which we have briefly surveyed so far, have to be understood as representing mainly the religio-mythological ideology of the classes of the Rgvedic poets, priests, and warriors. But there must have then existed also some forms of the religion of the masses or the common people. The gods of these ' popular ' cults could possibly not be by-passed altogether.

But while granting such recognition, those poet- priests took care to change the original character of those gods in such a way as to bring those gods, as far as possible, in line with the hieratic religio-mytho- logical ideology. However, fortunately for us, some indications about the original character of those gods have remained unobliterated in the tigyeda. A typical example of this phenomenon is the evolutionary mythology relating to Vi§nu. For instance, in a few passages of the Rgveda Visnu is characterised as šipivista. It is noteworthy that these passages are - perhaps deliberately - shrouded in obscurity. Apparently the Vedic poets were straining themselves to refer to Visnu's character denoted by the epithet šipivista in as guarded and vague a manner as possible. Etymologically, the word šipivista denotes an expanding, active male organ. Presumably, the concept of šipivista must have been regarded by the sophisticated poet-priests almost as taboo. In the Nirukta, Aupamanyava describes Visnu's epithet šipivista as kutsitãrthíya - " having a censurable implication ". This would explain why the Rgvedic poet-priests mentioned it ( when they were at all required to mention it ) almost grudgingly. That epithet signifies Viççu's connection with the concepts of virile power, procreation, fecundity, etc. In other words, Visnu must have originally been a god of virility and fertility. In confirmation of this hypo- thesis, attention may be drawn to the Vr§äkapi-hymn in the JfigvedaiB wherein the Vfsãkapi is said to have invested the exhausted lndra with fresh virile power. The identity of Vysakapi with Visnu is proved by considerable literary evidence. Viçnu's connection with virility, procreation, and fertility is further confirmed by some other incidental references in Vedic literature and ritual, such as Visnu's association with Sinívãli, the guardian goddess of wombs, his epithets nisiktapa 49 and sumajjãni ,50 and the formula, visnur yonim kalpayatu, employed in a rite connected with conception. Anthropological research has shown that many primitive communities have conceived their fertility-gods as having ' bird ' as their symbol. Some traces of this trend are to be seen in Vedic ritual also. For instance, the divinity which plays a very significant role in the Mahãvrata rite, which is obviously a fertility rite, is represented in the form of a bird. Similarly the Mahadukthya altar used in that rite has the shape of a bird. The word visnu is to be derived from the root vi ' to fly to which is suffixed the termina- « $V X. 86. 4» ÇV VII. 36. 9. »o $V I. 156. 2.</page><page sequence="12">li Annals BORÌ, LXX (1989 ) tion snu ( as in such words as jisnu, ksesnu ). Thus, Visnu, the god of virility and fertility, was also conceived as having the form of a bird. When, however, the Vedic poet-priests were constrained to admitVisnu into their mythology, they shrewdly shifted their emphasis from the concept of the bird as the symbol of a fertility-divinity to that of the bird as the symbol of a solar divinity. As a result of this, Visnu appears in the Rgveda mainly as the wide-striding sun-god. With a view to further elevating the mythological status of Visnu, the Vedic poets employed their usual strategy, namely, of relating that god, of course, with unmistakable artificiality, to Indra who had duly become the trademark, as it were, of the Regvedic mythology. The conception of dual-divinities in the Rgveda is certainly of great moment in the early Vedic evolutionary mythology. The relationship among the various Vedic gods was governed by certain religious-cultural compulsions. I believe that the conception of dual-divinities - at least in some major cases - has originated out of such compulsions. It has been already pointed out that, in the first phase of Rgvedic mythology which had developed in the Proto- Aryan period in the region round about Balkh, great emphasis was put on the belief of the sustenance and regulation of the cosmic phenomena, and inciden- tally of the affairs of human life, having been brought about through some kind of ' bondage ' There must have 'also developed, during that period, some kind of simple ritual involving Agni and Soma. But the predominant mythological concept was definitely that of the cosmic law Rta and the sovereign administrator of that law Asura Varuna. As has been pointed out earlier, so far as the Vedic mythology was concerned, the mythological concepts of Mitra and Aryaman represented merely an extension of the Varuna-concept - they were obviously minor and late. In course of time, however, Mitra's function must have come to be regarded as being as important as that of Varuna, for, the ethical-moral order in human affairs was believed to be as essential as in cosmic phenomena. The two gods representing the two different aspects of the same basic concept of ethical bond, namely, Asura Varuna and yãtayajjana Mitra, were combined to form a single divinity Mitrãvarunau. Indeed, so far as the Rgveda is concerned, the dual-divinity Mitrãvarunau has more hymns dedicated to it than to each of the two gods individually. Twenty- three whole hymns and parts of several others celebrate Mitrãvarunau, while Varuna has twelve hymns addressed to him and Mitra only one. In the case of Mitrãvarunau, the concept of dual-divinity served the purpose of religio- mythological complementaryness.51 61 The dual-divinities Dyàvàprthivî and Suryäcandramasau also are suggestive of complementaryness, but they are naturalistic rather than mythological.</page><page sequence="13">Dandekar : Reflections on Vedic Mythology 13 The concept of Indrãvarunau is, however, of far greater consequence. The dominant religious cult of the Proto-Aryan period was the Varuna-cult. The last years of the Proto-Aryan period witnessed the migration of the Proto- Aryans towards Iran on the one hand and towards Saptasindhu or the Land of Seven Rivers on the other. The migration towards Saptasindhu meant for these people, whom we may now call Vedic Aryans, a drastic change in their way of life and thought, particularly after their fairly long sojourn in the region of Balkh. It was now a life of fateful confrontation with Vrtras - human foes and environmental impediments - and of consequent warlike adventures. This new life of conquest and colonization called for a new religion and a new god. The cosmic religion of the world-sovereign Asura Varuna could no longer adequately meet the exigencies of the new age. The Vedic Aryans naturally craved for a heroic god who could bless and promote their onward march towards Saptasindhu and beyond. So was Vjrtrahã Indra ' born ' in the Vedic pantheon. Consequently, there developed in Vedic reli- gion two major sects, presumably rivalling each other, namely, the more ancient sect centering round Asura Varuna and the newly evolved one center- ing round Vrtrahã Indra. A headlong conflict between these two sects could have adversely affected the solidarity of the Vedic community. The impending schism within the Vedic Aryandom had to be avoided at all costs. This was achieved by the evolutionary Vedic mythology through the conception of the dual-divinity Indrãvarunau. There are in the Rgveda eight whole hymns and parts of two hymns which have Indrãvarunau as devatã. Out of these, the four hymns in the seventh book of the Rgveda , which, incidentally, form the largest single group of Indrãvarunau hymns, are particularly significant. Vasistha, the seer of the seventh book, was a devoted protagonist of the Varuna cult.52 But, transcending all thought of bigotry, he assumed a very practical and realistic attitude and deliberately sought to co-ordinate and harmonize the two reli- gious sects. He studiously emphasised in his Indrãvarunau hymns that the spheres of activity of Varuna and Indra, though separate, were essentially complementary and that an active collaboration, on equal terms, of these two gods would alone ensure the properly integrated and amicable operation of the world-process in its cosmic and socio-political aspects. All thought of antagonism between Varuna and Indra was vigorously discountenanced and an attitude of religious conciliation became quite transparent. This, Vasistha accomplished in various ways. For instance, he identified the specific 82 See " A Vedic god and a Vedic seer " in Dandekar, Vedic Mythological Tracts , pp, 312-350.</page><page sequence="14">14 Annals BORI LXX (1989.) spheres of sovereignty of these two gods by characterising Varuna as samräj or primeval world-sovereign and Indra as svarãj or one who won his divine suzerainty through his own prowess.53 In the course of the development of the Vedic religious ideology, Varuna, the administrator of cosmic law, also came to be represented specifically as the god who enforced moral order within the human community. In his índrãvarunau hymns, Vasistha has taken special pains to reiterate that Indra, the war-god, sponsored the Vedic Aryans' exploits of conquest and colonization ( prtanãsu ), while Varuna, the moral governor, blessed their efforts in connection with the establishment of law and order ( ksemasya prasave ).54 Both gods were great ( mahãntau ) in their respective roles ; having duly recognised this, all other gods, in the highest heaven, subserved índrãvarunau by consigning into them their splendour and their strength.55 But Vasistha's main slogan in his efforts to bring about conciliation between the Varuna-cult and the Indra-cult may be said to have been embodied in RV VII. 83. 9 ab : vrtrãny anyah samithesu jighnate vratãny anyo abhi raksate sadã " One of the two gods proclaims Vasistha, " vanquishes the enemies in battles, while the other ever sustains the socio-ethical laws ". In other words, Indra conquers and Varuna rules . Similar purpose of religious conciliation is served by the dual-divinity Indrãbrhaspati. The Vedic god Byhaspati, as pointed out earlier, was con- ceived to counteract the undue glorification of military prowess which had been engendered by the Indra-dominated mythology. There was, however, the fear, which was perhaps not quite unwarranted, that the conflict between what may be loosely called the Brahman-cult and the Ksatra-cult might jeopordize the solidarity of the Vedic community. Actually, what needed to be specifically emphasised was that, in order to be successful, military activity had to be necessarily augmented by the magically potent mantras . The evolutionary Vedic mythology accomplished this, first by presenting Bfha- spati, a new-comer in the Vedic pantheon, as a companion and ally of Indra in his various exploits56 and then by celebrating the dual-divinity Indrãbjrhas- pati as in the two whole hymns, R V IV. 49 and VII. 97. Besides complementaryness ( as in the case of Mitrãvarunau ) and con- ciliatory adjustment ( as in the case of índrãvarunau and Indrãbrhaspati ), the w $V VII. 82. 2. «a .ÇV VII. 82. 4 ab; 5 cd; 6. ™ BV VII. 82. 2 bed. •e ÇV li. 23. 18; 24. 2; Vlil. 85. 15.</page><page sequence="15">DandekàR ' Reflections on Vedic Mythology l5 third purpose which the conception of the dual-divinities served was religio- mythological elevation or hierarchization. We have seen that the third phase of the evolutionary Vedic mythology was characterised by, among other things, the gradual emergence to prominence of 4 popular ' and ' indigenous ' religi- ous cults. The god, who might be regarded as being particularly represen- tative of this trend, was Visnu. In the Rgvedic mythology, Visnu is seen to be steadily developing from his original character as a popular fert il ity-divi- nity to an artificially sophisticated solar divinity. In course of time, the Rgvedic mythology sought to validate this elevated mythological status of that god. It brought this about by associating Visnu with Indra in howsoever superficial and artificial a manner. Indra had become the very hallmark of the hieratic Rgvedic religion, as is amply testified by the conspicuously Indra- dominated Rgvedic mythology. He served as a catalyst, as it were, in the process of the hieratic elevation of ' popular ' gods. Intrinsically Visnu had nothing in common with Indra - he had hardly anything to do with Indra. But the Vedic mythology-makers made him a subordinate ally or an equal partner or a superior associate of Indra in his heroic deeds57 and eventually confirmed his elevated status by combining him with Indra to form the dual- divinity Indrävisnü.58 Cf. Rv VIII. 12. 27; VII. 99. 4-6; I. 154. 6; 155. 2; II. 22. 1; VITT. 3. 8; 12. 16. Ä8 One whole hymn, namely Rv VI. 69, is dedicated to Indrävisnü. This dual-divinity is also referred to in many other passages. Incidentally it may be mentioned that the history of the dual-divinity Indrãpúsãnau has much in common with that of Indrävisnü,</page></plain_text>
