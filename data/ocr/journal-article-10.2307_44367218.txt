<plain_text><page sequence="1">THZ COMPAKATIST CHRONOS/CHROMA: YELLOW FIGURES IN PROUST'S LA PRISONNIÈRE AND BELY'S PETERSBURG In the tradition of Bakhtin's "chronotope"1 (the Greek chronos, time, plus topos , place) I would like to propose the term "chromo-tope" {chroma = color). Whereas the chronotope functions as a time-marker, singling out time as the fourth dimension of space, the chromo-tope spaces out time by means of color. Through the consideration of a particular color, yel- low, I aim to explore, in a series of texts and visual images from the first half of the twentieth century, the convergence of time and color. I con- tend that yellow motifs function as time-markers during this period, and thus as chromo-topes. The choice of time period is not an arbitrary one, since it is at this moment that yellow becomes an emblematic presence, a stigmatizing force that alternates between the Medieval and the Modern, East and West, inscribing itself under the signs of the "Yellow Stať' (stigmatizing Jews) and the "Yellow Peril" (stigmatizing Asians).2 What I call a "chromo-tope" moves along the border of the historical and the aesthetic, without, however, involving questions of intentional- ity. For chromo-topes imply an intrinsic displacement, a meaning recog- nizable only after the fact, as a reinscription, refiguration, or recon- struction. Thus it is not a matter of a yellow symbolism , because sym- bolism implies a certain conventionality or preexisting system of signific- ation, an intention to activate a given semantic field. Chromo-topes func- tion on the level of figurai relations, that is, of relations that reveal how what is marked in yellow announces its own coming about. One could usefully compare what I mean by chromo-tope with Auer- bachs notion of figura or "figurai realism." In his classic work Mimesis , Auerbach contrasts the "excessive abstraction" of symbol and allegory with the "realism" of figures: An event taken as a figure preserves its literal and historical meaning. It remains an event, does not become a mere sign. The Church Fathers, especially Tertullian, Jerome, Augustine, had successfully defended figurai realism, that is, the maintenance of the basic historical reality of figures, against all attempts at spiritually allegorical interpretation. (196)3 In the figurai interpretation, both chronology and reality are preserved. The figurai connection between events constitutes their historical mean- ing. Thus a "figurai realism" was seen by Christian authors such as Dante as a way to link Biblical figures to mundane events, so that those events or people, taken from the world in which he lived, became them- selves figures of Christian ideas (e.g., conversion, salvation) without negating their historicity or their reality. More broadly speaking, then, "figurai realism" means that material or human events can receive an interpretation that is at once historical Vol. 28 (2004): 53</page><page sequence="2">YELLOW mU-R.ES Ibi PROUST ANV BELY and tropologica! This is in effect what I attempt to do with the color yellow in this essay: the materiality and historicity of yellow elements only come to the fore if they are viewed as figures, that is, as concrete manifestations of other equally concrete and historical events. An allegorical or symbolic interpretation of yellow, though perhaps valid in some contexts, would annul the historical meaning that early twentieth- century avant-garde writers intend (as well as obscure the significance of their technical procedures), in their effort to forge a new kind of realism, namely a "figurai realism" in which access to historical reality is achieved by charging seemingly random, mundane things or events with figurai force. As Auerbach writes of Proust: [He] presents individual days and hours from different periods, but the ex- terior events which are the determining factors in the destinies of the novel's characters during the intervening lapses of time are mentioned only incidentally, in retrospect or anticipation. The ends the narrator has in mind are not to be seen in them; often the reader has to supplement them. (547) To offer these "supplements" is the task set for this essay. We will follow a topography of yellow that is marked by historical, biographical, and political events, to explore how the materiality of writing (writing-paper, wall-paper, ink, pigments) is linked to the power of self-inscription. For yellow chromo-topes are not themselves visual or perceptible as such, but demonstrate the capacity of writing to impact the visual in a way that the visual could never do by itself or on its own account. The temporal mode in which chromo-topes appear is that of the irre- ducible instant or moment - the flash, or Augenblick . At the edge of the visible, yellow motifs have the structure of events: ephemeral, unrepeat- able, yet indelible. But the event is not effaced by being converted into symbol or allegory. The chronotope emerges, Bakhtin says, as a "center for concretizing representation" (243). Without representing and without being represented themselves, chromo-topes nevertheless happen in the text. They embody the intensity of a moment - an atmosphere, a stimu- lus - with explosive potential. Thus chromo-topes are not neutral; they present a perspective, or rather - in them perspective itself is thematized and made literal. Determined in time and space, chromo-topes, like chro- notopes, are "always colored by emotions and values" (243). Alternating between polar opposites, between positive and negative, or between golden and dirty yellow tones, valuation (as opposed to abstraction) is an essential part of the chromo-tope. Like Bakhtin 's "chronotope," the articulation of values in the chromo-tope wanders through 'living artistic perception" (243), which does not recognize divisions between units of time, space, and value: "art and literature are shot through with chronotopic values of varying degree and scope. Each motif, each separate aspect of artistic work bears value" (243). Materializing nuances of color, in time and space, the yellow chromo- tope will subvert the stable value system, the discourse of symbolic lan- Vob. 28 (2004): 54</page><page sequence="3">THE COMPAKATIST guage, and thus seeks to exemplify, in concrete terms, a displacement of the work of art in its relation to the world. However, its subversive quality is only secured within the realm of aesthetics: to paraphrase Nietzsche, chromo-topes are only justified as aesthetic phenomena. Other types of questions, political and historical, will be considered through the prism of the aesthetic. This paper will treat "yellow figures" in two novels which appeared between the two world wars: the fifth volume of Marcel Proust's A la Recherche du temps perdu, La Prisonnière (1923), and Andrei Bely's symbolist novel Petersburg (1922). I. Prousťs "Little Yellow Patch of Wall": Ekphrasis in Chromotopes In one of the most famous scenes of Prousťs La Prisonnière, the writer Bergotte's death in front of Vermeer's View of Delft prompts the narrator to focus on a 'little yellow patch on the wall" ("petit pan de mur jaune"), which is seemingly part of the painting. I must quote the passage at length because it frames our discussion of yellow chromo-topes in Proust: The circumstances of his death were as follows. A fairly mild attack of uraemia had led to his being ordered to rest. But, an art critic having written somewhere that in Vermeer's View of Delft (lent by the Gallery at The Hague for an exhibition of Dutch painting), a picture which he had adored and imagined that he knew by heart, a little patch of yellow wall (which he could not remember) was so well painted that it was, as if one looked at it by itself, like some priceless specimen of Chinese art, of a beauty that was sufficient in itself, Bergotte ate a few potatoes, left the house, and went to the exhibition. At the first few steps he had to climb, he was overcome by an attack of dizziness. He walked past several pictures and was struck by the aridity and pointlessness of such an artificial kind of art, which was greatly inferior to the sunshine of a windswept Venetian palazzo, or of an ordinary house by the sea. At last he came to the Vermeer which he remembered as more striking, more different from anything else he knew, but in which, thanks to the critic's article, he noticed for the first time some small figures in blue, that the sand was pink, and, finally, the precious substance of the tiny patch of yellow wall [missing in this translation: "as precious in itself as a Chinese artwork"]. His dizziness increased; he fixed his gaze, like a child upon a yellow butterfly that it wants to catch, on the precious little patch of wall. "That's how I ought to have written," he said. "My last books are too dry, I ought to have gone over them with a few layers of color, made my language precious in itself, like this little patch of yellow wall ." Meanwhile he was not unconscious of the gravity of his condition. In a celestial pair of scales, there appeared to him, weighing down one of the pans, his own life, while the other contained the little patch of wall so beautifully painted in yellow. He felt that he had rashly sacrificed the former for the latter. "All the same," he said to himself, "I shouldn't like to be the headline news of this exhibition for the evening papers." Vol. 28 (2004): 55</page><page sequence="4">YELLOW flĢURES IM PROUST ANV BELY He repeated to himself: "Little patch of yellow wall , with a sloping roof, little patch of yellow wall ." Meanwhile he sank down on to a circular settee; whereupon he suddenly ceased to think that his life was in jeo- pardy and, reverting to his natural optimism, told himself: "It's nothing, merely a touch of indigestion from those potatoes, which were under- cooked." A fresh attack struck him down; he rolled from the settee to the floor, as visitors and attendants came hurrying to his assistance. He was dead. Dead for ever? Who can say? Certainly, experiments in spiritualism offer us no more proof than the dogmas of religion that the soul survives death. All that we can say is that everything is arranged in this life as though we entered it carrying a burden of obligations contracted in a former life; there is no reason inherent in the conditions of life on this earth that can make us consider ourselves obliged to do good, to be kind and thoughtful, even to be polite, nor for an atheist artist to consider himself obliged to begin over again a score of times a piece of work the admiration aroused by which will matter by his little worm-eaten body, like the patch of yellow wall painted with so much skill and refinement by an artist destined to be for ever unknown and barely identified under the name Vermeer. [. . .] They buried him, but all through that night of mourning, in the lighted shop-windows, his books, arranged three by three, kept vigil like an angel with outspread wings and seemed, for him who was no more, the symbol of his resurrection." (244-46)4 This is one of the most important moments in the entire Recherche , for it prefigures Prousťs own death. In 1921, Proust had himself attended an exhibition of Vermeer's paintings at the Jeu de Paume museum in Paris. There he could again contemplate his favorite Vermeer painting, the View of Delft, which he had seen almost twenty years earlier during a visit to The Hague.5 Celeste Albaret tells of this visit as follows: In the year 1921, [Proust's] only memorable outing was to visit, in the company of the writer Jean-Louis Vaudoyer, whom he liked so well, the exposition of Dutch painting that was being held at the Jeu de Paume that spring [. . .] and it was particularly to see again the paintings of his dear Vermeer, notably the little patch of yellow wall. Jean-Louis Vaudoyer had come to pick him up in the morning at the stroke of eleven. As far as I can remember, he returned sometime early in the evening, exhausted. He had had vertigo during the visit of the exposition.6 A little over a year after this event, on November 18, 1992, Proust was dead. He had published the Prisonnière just weeks before. No doubt the ailing Proust had sensed his own death, and in the Bergotte passage wished to immortalize it in his own writing. Like his fictive author, Proust would have preferred to die after seeing the Vermeer painting one last time. The Recherche would therefore be, as he says of Bergotte's books, the "symbol of his resurrection." René Girard interprets the introduction of Christian imagery into this scene as sincere without "disturbing the external positive and 'realist' order" of Proust's work: "The death and resurrection of Bergotte Vol. 28 (2004): 56</page><page sequence="5">THE COMPAKATIST prefigure the death and resurrection of the author himself, the second birth from which Remembrance of Things Past springs. The true reson- ance of the sentence just quoted is the expectation of that resurrection" (translation modified, 313). Thus Proust transcends the Romantic cliche of posthumous glory, inscribing his own spiritual hopes within an aesthetic context. But the principal interest of this passage here is the way in which the 'little yellow patch of wall" figures in a scene of such monumental importance, not only for the Recherche but for Proust himself.7 Interestingly, though the View of Delft is hardly ever referred to without mentioning Proust's discussion of it, there appears to be a consensus that there is no yellow in this painting, thus questioning the propriety of the description 'little yellow patch of wall." Mieke Bal writes, for example, that the 'little yellow patch" is "nowhere to be seen in the painting" (260). A closer look at her conclusion reveals a problematic misreading both of Proust and of the Vermeer painting; while she allows that Proust could be referring to a little patch of light at the extreme right of the painting, she argues that this wall is far from being, as she quotes, a 'little wall," but rather a "quite robust-looking wall" (260), and thus not a 'little patch." Reducing the phrase, "little yellow patch of wall," to 'little wall," Bal misses the point - that is, she misses the yel- low.8 Bai also misses the significance of this color in the pages of the Recherche cited above, in which the "yellow little patch of wall" is men- tioned eight times. What I aim to show is that only an iconographical reading of Vermeer, and of Vermeer's painting as presented by Proust, can solve the mystery of the yellow patch. The wall to which Bal refers as a "rather robust-looking wall" is the wall of the New Church, which Vermeer bathes in sunlight, while depicting the Old Church in its shadow. The illuminated wall of the New Church is certainly one of the focal points of the painting. However, we must remember that Proust does not refer to it as a "little wall" but as a 'little yellow patch of wall" in the painting, not in reality. For seen from afar, it forms, despite the distance, the painting's most luminous spot. It is where Vermeer casts the sunlightģ Thus this light is the "yel- low" of the "little yellow patch." Vermeer uses the light to emphasize the reformed church during the period of Enlightenment. Thus what Proust actually refers to with 'little yellow patch"is point of view: point of view in terms of time and space. This is, in fact, the theme of the painting; hence the title: View of Delft. The title points to the technique of perspec- tivism that is performed in the painting. The View of Delft creates differ- ent focal points and thereby viewpoints on the city. If, as Deleuze says, Proust prefers the "telescope, not the microscope" in his writing (113), we can interpret him as emphasizing Vermeer's own concentration on the New Church in an analogous manner to the painter himself. Seen from a distance, Vermeer creates a focal point not by magnitude but by luminosity. Furthermore, as the Reformed Church of Delft is a figure of the period of Enlightenment (in which there are old Vol. 28 (2004): 57</page><page sequence="6">YELLOW FIGURES IN PROUST ANV RELY and new buildings, gates, water streets, harbors), Vermeer can be seen as shifting the focus away from purely spatial relationships towards temporal indicators. The new and the old parts of the city are juxtaposed beneath a cloudy sky, and fleeting moments of light and shadow are reflected in the sea. What I would like to suggest in this section is that Proust is attempting to achieve similar effects in his writing. The Ver- meer painting, then, functions as a sort of allegory of the Proustian style of presentation. During Bergotte's death scene, the writer compares his own work to the "precious little yellow patch of wall." Bergotte's description of the patch employs the rhetorical technique of ekphrasis, literally: to make us see. What he makes us see is a series of oblique references to art and literature from Proust's time, which I will now attempt to unpack. These references place us back in a period, that of the fin de siècle, in which yellow had become a fashionable color. However, despite its popularity during this era, it is impossible to use the color yellow (in Western culture) without simultaneously conjuring up its stigmatizing force.9 As we wül see, Proust brings the ambivalent aspects of yellow together. The association of yellow with excrement, decay, death, or official stigma (Jews) can be connected, often within a single element, with light, enlightenment, and gold (value). By means of the Vermeer painting Proust is moving through mod- ernity, shifting from Vermeer's emphasis on the Enlightenment in the View of Delft (the illuminated wall of the Reformed Church), toward the present, thus contrasting an era of enlightenment with an era of appar- ent decline and decadence. Yellow is the pivot point where opposing values and signs clash and are put into relief. Each time that Bergotte focuses on the "yellow little patch of wall" can be correlated to a different moment in recent art history, moving towards the actual moment of (the writing of) La Prisonnière. The political background for these yellow signs is the Dreyfus Affair: "the Dreyfus case was long since over, but twenty years later people would still talk about it, and so far only two years had elapsed" (Proust 42). The revival of anti-Semitism in the Dreyfus Affair (from which a city like Delft in Vermeer's time had liberated itself) is a major topic in Proust's oeuvre, most prominently in La Prisonnière, in which the Affair is discussed at length twice. As we will see, the Dreyfus Affair frames the discussion of the "little yellow patch of wall," which actualizes anti-Semitism by way of yellow stigmatism. At stake here is a technique of inscription rather than what Didi- Huberman calls "painting in the act." When Didi-Huberman discusses the scene of the "little yellow patch of wall," he defines the patch "as an unstable index and an intrusion of the very act of painting into the rep- resentation, which, rather than being structured by this patch, is torn open by it" (qtd. in Bal 83-83). In this manner Didi-Huberman develops notions of instability and ambiguity stemming from the repetitions of the little yellow patch of wall." The question in Didi-Huberman's account is Vol. 28 (2004): 58</page><page sequence="7">THE COMPAKATIST whether the color yellow refers to the wall, in which case it would simply be a detail of the wall, or to the patch, which is a kind of floating signi- fier pointing to the "act of painting7' (Cf. Bal 82-83). I contend, however, that the yellow patch is not a visible detail of the painting, but rather a theme of the painting, a theme highlighted by Proust's technique of writing. In his description, Proust's dying writer engages in the "process of production as a work of art" (Deleuze 148), which functions as a manifestation of yellow signs and their illumination - through works of art, into a work of art. I will now explore in more detail the chromo- topes of the yellow "to- pography" at work in this scene. My argument is that a chromo-topic reading of the 'little yellow patch of wall" will account for the concrete, historical references of the actual time frame that forms Proust's horizon of reference in La Prisonnière (twenty years after the Dreyfus Affair). I will also take into account Proust's figurai relationship to Vermeer's artistic techniques, namely that of spacing out time according to point of view. For Bal and Didi-Huberman do not see the color yellow as im- portant to the interpretation of the "little yellow patch of wall," because they fail to perceive the dense network of references created by the figurai force of yellow, or, as I am calling it, the yellow chromo-tope. 1.1. The Yellow House (Van Gogh) Proust's use of the "little yellow patch of wall" introduces what one could call a creative network, in which yellow moves between various references - political, social, artis- tic - and thereby does not merely reflect, but develops its emblematic force (Deleuze 113). Proust connects the zooming-in on the "little yellow patch of wall," seen from a great distance, with Bergotte's last journey to the Vermeer exhibit. The preparation for Bergotte's journey, as well as the deadly vertigo he experiences in front of the View of Delft, consti- tutes, as I will show, a journey through various artworks. Proust thereby transforms Vermeer's technique of multi-perspectivism into Bergotte's technique of ekphrasis,10 making us see the yellow patch eight times and introducing different perspectives with each repetition. In particular, Proust establishes a direct link between Vermeer and the art of Vincent van Gogh, who took Vermeer's art as a model for his own use of color. The psychosomatic effects associated with the color yellow - the pathologies of Bergotte as well as of Proust himself- recall the direct relation between van Gogh's artistic practice and his mental condition later in life. We are confronted with a range of health problems relating to Bergotte's person: problems of digestion, a urinary infection, hypothermia, and insomnia. For example, Bergotte's actual preparation for the journey to the Vermeer exhibition to see the "little yellow patch of wall" (which he had read about in the newspaper) involved eating only potatoes. Bergotte connects these potatoes with the vertigo that he suddenly experiences in front of the Vermeer painting. We can read this detail, I believe, as a veiled reference to van Gogh's first work, The Potato-Eaters (1885), which featured poor peasants eating potatoes as Voh 28 (2004): 59</page><page sequence="8">YELLOW flQURES IhJ PROUST ANV 3ELY their only means of sustenance. According to the narrator, however, the vertigo is not due to the potatoes but to a urinary infection. These conflicting views move the reader from the browner colors (of the potato-eaters) to yellow (urine). (This shift is mirrored in van Gogh's own movement from earthy colors to an increasing use of yellow pigments, and in the tension in his art between the bright and pale yellow tones.)11 The night before Bergotte visits the exhibition, he dreams that his coachman is cutting off Bergotte's fingers after he had criticized him for his style of driving. Interestingly Proust deflects this biographical material to raise the question of style. The cut-off fingers suggest the impossibility of the continuation of style (or a "non-style," as Deleuze claims). Proust is making the transition from a style of painting towards a style of inscribing and cutting into color. For van Gogh's technique was strongly influenced by Japanese wood- cuts. For example, van Gogh once painted a disjunctive juxtaposition of his bandaged head with an evocation of sunny Japan featuring Toyoku- ni's Geishas in a Landscape. This painting is an allegory of his adapta- tion of Japanese prints and imagery (McQuillan 34), as well as a refer- ence to the love affair that brought an end to his Yellow House period.12 This move from the biographical detail toward a new technique of paint- ing marks the self-reflexive center of the painting. Van Gogh further developed the "cutting" technique in the asylum: Asylum Garden: Field of Grass with Flowers and Butterflies (1890) features the use of woodcut technique in depicting an open field. Proust refers to this technique in the following lines from the longer "yellow patch" passage cited above: [H]e came to the Vermeer which he remembered as more striking, more different from anything else he knew, but in which [. . .] he noticed [. . .] finally, the precious substance of the tiny patch of yellow wall {as precious in itself as a Chinese artwork}. His dizziness increased; he fixed his gaze, like a child upon a yellow butterfly that it wants to catch, on the precious little patch of wall. "That's how I ought to have written," he said. "My last books are too dry, I ought to have gone over them with a few layers of color, made my language precious in itself, like this little patch of yellow wall." (244) The yellow patch of wall is set free in Bergotte's imagination: it becomes a yellow butterfly that he is unable to catch, but which captivates him - like the more colorful style that he should have used. But what does it mean to compare one's style to a yellow patch of wall? The use of the word "precious" provides the clue: its repetition creates a homology be- tween the 'little yellow patch" and the Chinese artwork. This artwork points to the influence that the movement of japonisme had on van Gogh - but with a deviation. From China to France, Proust is spacing out time, while zooming in on "the yellow little patch of wall" from different angles and directions. The figuration of displacements (from China to Japan, from Aries to asylum) leads to the moment of van Gogh's suicide. Proust alludes to the allegory of the reaper (a personification of death) Vol. 28 (2004): 60</page><page sequence="9">THE COMPAHATIST in the dream scene of the night before Bergotte's visit to the Vermeer exhibition. Like Proust, van Gogh (who committed suicide by shooting himself in the stomach in a cornfield) had prefigured his own death in his painting Wheatfield with a Reaper (1889), which features a man with a scythe cutting ripe yellow corn under the sun's bright disc. The tech- nique of cutting, to the extreme of cutting off one's own life, becomes the measure of true art, to which Proust exposes the writer Bergotte, who starts to reflect on his work in the light of the yellow patch of wall. 1.2. The Goldweigher (Vermeer) The use of allegorical figures characterizes most of Vermeer's paintings, the most famous example being The Allegory of Painting . In the following lines from the longer passage, which compares the "yellow little patch of wall" to his own life, I read Proust as alluding to the allegorical figure of Justice at the center of Vermeer's painting The Goldweigher . Meanwhile he was not unconscious of the gravity of his condition. In a celestial pair of scales, there appeared to him, weighing down one of the pans, his own life, while the other contained the little patch of wall so beautifully painted in yellow. He felt that he had rashly sacrificed the former for the latter. "All the same," he said to himself, "I shouldn't like to be the headline news of this exhibition for the evening papers." (244- 45) Clearly in this passage the little yellow patch of wall figures something specific, which is not merely textual. Bergotte's fear of being the sensa- tion of the evening edition of the newspaper is related to the picture that Vermeer painted on the wall. (Proust replaces the wallpaper with the newspaper.) In The Goldweigher , Vermeer depicts a scene from the Last Judgment that is juxtaposed with a pregnant woman weighing pearls. A biblical allegory of Justice watches over the vain occupation with earthly goods. The question of earthly versus religious values is brought up in the form of a balancing act through the figure of the pregnant woman: her gaze and her hand are directed toward the decisive point of balance; verticals and horizontals are divided up into squares, with the square defining the logic of the painting (Serres 18-19.) Both dimensions are regulating themselves, whereas the hand of the painter disappears in a maneuver which is crucial for Vermeer's technique in the View of Delft . Vermeer does not place the spectator in a single spot, but opens up multiple perspectives. The scale is therefore an allegory of his technique of balancing out different points of view (a technique that Proust reflects upon through his character Bergotte) from the perspective of life: not one that is close to giving birth ( The Goldweigher ), however, but close to dying (Bergotte). The pigment that Vermeer used for the pearls reflects their value: An Indian-yellow that was available only for a couple of years and is specifically known for its use by Vermeer and for being produced from the urine of cows fed with mango. Because this procedure caused urinary infections, it was soon prohibited (Brims 93). With respect to Bergotte's Vol. 28 (2004): 61</page><page sequence="10">YELLOW flQURES IN PROUST ANV BELY urinary infection, given as the cause of death in the newspaper article from which Proust quotes, Proust appears to be referring to this detail about the exceptional pigment, called "Monghir Piuri," which first ap- pears in the bright yellow tones of Vermeer's Goldweigher (Bruns 93). The color's preciousness is at the same time an index of Bergotte's sickness, the cause of his death. Dying of a urinary infection, he suffers from a disease that correlates with the yellow color that Vermeer was fond of using, if only for a short period. Paradoxically the "preciousness" of this yellow color involves death, and in the context of the allegory of Justice, one can thus interpret this passage as weighing the value of life against that of yellow, which figures death. Questions of value (preciousness, gold) as well as of death and dying (yellowing) have brought the yellow chromo-tope to the fore, thereby fulfilling the figure of another artwork. Thus Proust ends the death scene with Bergotte feeling the heaviness of his vertigo and conjuring up the image of the scales: on one side Bergotte can see his life, on the other the "yellow little patch of wall." Like Christ, Bergotte exchanges his life for the sins that brought the "yellow little patch" to his attention. He loses his balance, but is resurrected in the form of his books. The scene of his resurrection moves us forward to the figure of the yellow butterfly, since all butterflies emerge from their cocoon into a new life. 1.3. The Yellow Butterfly (Wilde) The yellow butterfly that Bergotte tries to catch twice appears not only in van Gogh's painting of the Asylum Garden but also in Oscar Wilde's poem Yellow Symphony (1889), in which an omnibus "across the bridge / Crawls like a yellow butterfly" (Wilde 808). Both scenes take us back to the 1890s, which is also the time of the Dreyfus Affair. Yellow has political as well as fashionable connotations, both of which are intertwined in the case of Oscar Wilde. As Frances Winwar writes, "there was something vivid and daring about that color, something of times [...]. Yellow and the fin de siècle began to have connotations that were open to many meanings, but all leading to a definable sense of modernity, challenge, emancipation" (112). Le Galienne names the period the 'Yellow Nineties," which he describes in one of his prose fancies as "The Boom in Yellow" (85). Its culmination was the appearance of The Yellow Book. A Quarterly , edited by Beardsley and Harland, which was published between 1894 and 1896. Harland described The Yellow Book as illuminating the windows of the bookstores the first time that it appeared on a foggy day in London. Proust appears to allude to this sight in describing the night of Ber- gotte's funeral in the passage cited above: "They buried him, but all through that night of mourning, in the lighted shop-windows, his books, arranged three by three, kept vigil like angels with outspread wings and seemed, for him who was no more, the symbol of his resurrection" (246). Bergotte's resurrection in his books harks back to The Yellow Book as an illuminated book. Vol. 28 (2004): 62</page><page sequence="11">THE COMPAKATIST Bergotte's fear of becoming the "sensation" of the evening paper connects up with Wilde's arrest "with a yellow book under his arm," a detail that created a sensation as a sign of his homosexual lifestyle.13 (Wilde's judgment of The Yellow Book the day after its first appearance was harsh: "It is horrid and not yellow at all" [Weintraub xvi].) This criticism resonates with Bergotte's self-critique of his last books while focusing on the yellow patch of wall: "I ought to have gone over them with a few layers of color ."(244). As a "sin of the world," homosexuality is kept secret in A Picture of Dorian Gray . The Recherche also develops a secret language for talking about this topic, with the yellow chromo-tope functioning as a token of homosexuality that links the Wilde scandal with the narrator of the Recherche . Proust speaks of it as a "modern Gomorrah": Sweet, gay, innocent moments to all appearance, and yet moments in which there gathers the unsuspected possibility of disaster, which makes the amorous life the most precarious of all, that in which the unpredictable rain of sulphur and brimstone falls after the most radiant moments, whereupon, without having the heart or the will to draw a lesson from our misfortune, we set to work at once to rebuild upon the slopes of the crater from which nothing but catastrophe can emerge. (98) The rain of sulphur leads us back to the yellow butterfly, which Bergotte would have liked to catch. In English one kind of yellow butterfly is called a brimstone , in French a soufre, and in German a Zitronenfalter , or, literally, a lemon-folder . The butterfly, a trope of metamorphosis, shifts the scene from life to death, from bright, yellow moments to cata- strophic ones. Proust's technique in the Recherche of opening up significant mem- ory traces that are triggered by seemingly random events or elements only becomes legible and visible in the "inner book" that Proust makes us read. What he marks through yellow are points of tension, or turning points, that are inscribed in the proper name of yellow itself. Roland Barthes has commented on similar practices elsewhere in the Recherche , citing a passage on proper names in The Guermantes Way: "But later, I find in the duration of this name within myself, seven or eight different figures one after the other . . (qtd. in Barthes 60). Though here Proust is pointing to a series of scenes linked to a proper name, clearly the number seven or eight could also apply to the eight repetitions of the 'little yellow patch of wall." II. Bely's Yellow Figures: Chromo-topes and Anthropomorphisms "What, then, is truth? A mobile army of metaphors, metonymies, anthropomorphisms [. . .]" (Nietzsche 146) Yellow becomes a sign of aesthetic movements as well as of political ones for the Russian Symbolist writer Andrej Bely, particularly in his novel Vol 28 (2004): 63</page><page sequence="12">YELLOW FIGURES IN PROUST ANV SELY Petersburg , set in the revolutionary year of 1905 (it was written in 1911- 12, serialized in 1913-14, first published in book form in 1916, then extensively revised in 1922). In this novel Bely focuses on the fear of "yellow hordes" from Asia, a threat that seemed imminent for those who saw the "Yellow Peril everywhere and apocalypse around the corner," as Malmstad and Maguirre explain in the notes to their translation of Petersburg . Bely situates the novel at the time of the Russian Navy's defeat by the Japanese, who "annihilated a large Russian squadron in a few hours, thereby creating the impression that Imperial Japan was a world power to be reckoned with" (Bely 325). This impression was all the stronger since Russia's medieval experience of being devasted and enslaved by Mongols (the Tartars) had been revived in the late nine- teenth-century imagination. Thus Malmstad and Maguirre note the strong influence on Bely of Vladimir Solovyov's poem "Panmongolism" (1894), which "predicted a new invasion of Russia by Asiatic hordes as a retribution for Russia's 'sins"' (Bely 325). To draw attention to the destabilizing force of the Yellow Peril topos in Petersburg , I will use Malmstad and Maguirre's notes to their trans- lation as well as their excellent interpretation of the novel in Andrey Bely : Spirit of Symbolism. Despite the conclusion that they rightly draw, that "the 'truth' in Petersburg is given in no postulate, but takes form from a complex of contradictions and half-truths that are in ceaseless movement" (144), I wish to emphasize one significant constant in Peters- burg : the destructiveness of the yellow figures deployed by Bely. This section will examine how the Yellow Peril undermines Bely's color symbolism by virtue of its anthropomorphism. Yellow becomes part of the human condition, seen by Bely as a descent into animality. Meta- morphosis into the Yellow Peril leading up to an explosion is paralleled by the degeneration of humans into animal-like figures. For my pur- poses, anthropomorphism thus entails not just humanizing the non- human (its more usual meaning) but also dehumanizing the human. Nietzsche's notion of the "eternal return" had a strong impact on Bely, who draws many of his ideas and themes from The Birth of Tragedy and Thus Spoke Zarathustra. If "movement without end along the spiral" (Maguire and Malmstad 144) characterizes Petersburg, this movement is also embodied in the Yellow Peril, which inscribes itself repeatedly until it becomes the truth of Petersburg ("saffron yellow" is found all over the city). Bely's undermining of the Yellow Perü through yellow figures is linked to Nietzsche's notion of anthropomorphism as the figure of unstable truth: "What, then, is truth? A mobile army of metaphors, metonymies, anthropomorphisms [. . .]" (146). Nietzsche's conception of truth as tropologica! is apropos here due to his inclusion of the "trope" of anthropomorphism, which differs from the other tropes on his list in that it does not involve substitution. As Paul de Man has remarked, what Nietzsche is really talking about is exclu- sion : anthropomorphisms are more like chromo-topes than tropes, for anthropomorphism "is not just a trope but an identification on the level Vol. 28 (2004): 64</page><page sequence="13">TUZ COMPAKATIST of substance. It takes one entity for another and thus implies the consti- tution of specific entities prior to their confusion. [. . .] Anthropomorph- ism freezes the infinite chain of tropological transformations and prop- ositions into one single assertion or essence which, as such excludes all others" (241). An anthropomorphism is not a proposition any more, but a proper name - or rather an act of naming, a naming of an appearance, the giving of a human form. This way of appropriation brings truth to the fore, violently inscribing what remains excluded as inhuman. An- thropomorphisms are in that sense a transitional moment on the verge of inhumanity, telling the truth about human beings. The inhuman receives its attributes from the imagination, set in motion in the world of Petersburg by the "yellow peril." The development of this danger, which Bely describes in terms of violent contact between East and West, can be recognized by the sense of taste (as already seen in Proust): "Man is what he eats" (26), remarks Dudkin, one of the secret agents in Petersburg , while chatting in a rest- aurant with the rival agent, Lippanchenko. "Lip" in Russian suggests sticky - and what sticks to each other in Petersburg are these two agents: each is haunted by the other, while at the same time sticking to and haunting other characters as well. The sticky material of the novel forms a sort of collage. Walls, wallpaper, newspaper, pages of books - these are the surfaces upon which these two agents propagate the threat of the Yellow Peril, which Bely describes as existing inside us as much as outside. At certain turning points anthropomorphism comes to the fore, forming chromo-topes; the real-world event that is called the "Yellow Peril" figures and is figured by Bely's yellow motifs. 2.1. The Yellow Suit (Dostoevsky) 'The huge yellow spot" that Dosto- evsk/s Underground Man finds on his pants (81) prefigures the yellow- striped suit worn by the lifelong terrorist Lippanchenko, with his 'little Mongolian eyes." Lippanchenko is the embodiment of the yellow peril invading Petersburg from the East - but also from the inside. Whereas the Underground Man undermines society by his misanthropic demean- or and his withdrawal from social life, his position is ultimately passive; he disdains all meaningful action. Lippanchenko, on the other hand, is an active terrorist through and through, an apparent spy for the under- ground determined to overthrow the political system. Lippanchenko's marginal and menacing status is accentuated and figured in the anthro- pomorphic evocation of his fish-like appearance: The fat man, called Lippanchenko by the stranger, was about to set his dark yellow elbow on the sheet of newspaper covering the bundle. [. . .] His lips still quivered, resembling pieces of sliced salmon, not yellowish red, but oily and yellow. [. . .] Around them was heard: "What is Man?" "Man is what he eats." "I know." Vol. 28 (200V: 65</page><page sequence="14">YELLOW FIGURES IN PROUST ANV SELY "Well, since you know, grab a plate and eat." (24, 26) The color yellow serves in this passage to underline Lippanchenko's un- seemly and slimy appearance. There is also something sinister about his yellowness, as with the idea that man is defined by an appropriation, that man becomes what he eats. That is, the color yellow serves as a fig- ure of metamorphosis, as a pivot point between animality and humanity, and in that sense an anthropomorphism. "Lipchenky" was a pseudonym of the real-life terrorist and double agent for the secret police Alez Fishelvich, after his escape to Berlin in 1908. In Russian lipovyi is slang for "fake, counterfeit." Lippanchenko, also a double agent, has as many counterfeit features as his real world counterpart, Fishelvich. His fish-like skin is as oily as the sardine tin that holds the bomb that will explode at the end of the novel. The four walls of the sardine tin, the salmon lips, and the yellow stripes of his suit all indicate the linearity of a destructive plan. Whereas the "huge yellow spot" that irritates Dostoevsky's Underground Man has a self-destruc- tive force, Lippanchenko's yellow surfaces accumulate a destructive en- ergy that will self-destruct as they attack him. His yellow marks do not cause fever, as with the Underground Man, but make him shine: "Polish gleamed on his yellow shoes" (24). These oily and shiny surfaces contrast with the dusty surface that surrounds the grey figure of the senator, Apollo Apollonovich Ableukhov. Though inextricably linked, both kinds of surface are part of a linear system in which paternal figures occupy diametrically opposed positions: Lippanchenko, father of the criminal underground, and Apollo Apollon- ovich, father of the bureaucratic system. But this opposition serves only to connect them even more closely, as shown by their respective fates. Whereas Lippanchenko's corpse will explode into gases (which form part of the yellow dust that Ableukhov sweeps off his books), Ableukhov at the end of his life turns into "a little yellow old man" (Bely 95), taking on Lippanchenko's skin-color. Becoming yellow is the danger signal inscribed in the Yellow Peril: the Asian hordes overwhelming the country. It is becoming the texture of surfaces and skins and therefore of the 'book of Destinies," which Bely imagines in his essay "Circular Movement": "The aggregate of pages is muscles; and the title page is the skin" (qtd. by Maguire and Malmstad 142). The surface color of yellow becomes the title page of a book in which the Yellow Peril blossoms into a living organism (that is, by way of anthropomorphism). The defiguration into yellow anthropomorphisms describes the process that Bely calls the "eternal changing of unchanging positions" (Maguire and Malmstad 143). The interchange of Ableukhov's and Lippanchenko's positions (the two characters contain each other's names anagramatically via Ableukhov's patronymic Apollonovich), form, in a process of decomposition, the matter of the book, which moves in the manner of a spiral held together by the force of the Yellow Peril - an em- blematic force that Bely defines as "pulsation of the elemental body" (Bely 184). The oily element of Lippanchenko and the dusty element of Volí 28 (2004): 66</page><page sequence="15">THE COMPARA TIST Apollonovich form a collage of the Yellow Peril, in which the substance of their skins and surfaces is absorbed into the movement of the spiral. That Bely draws on a concrete event, the Japanese victory over Russia in 1905, displaces the discussion into a historical dimension; the novel Petersburg becomes the destiny of the city Petersburg. 2.2. Yellow Dust (Nietzsche) Because Bely 's references to literary and historical figures are typically caricatures, his historical citations are always overdetermined, in the sense that the body parts of these figures are available for quotation.14 One prototype of the Ableukhov character is Konstantin Pobedonostsev, the main representative of the Holy Synod and one of the most hated reactionaries and fanatic anti-Semites of his time. In a well-known caricature from 1905, Pobedonostsev is shown in the same pose in which Bely presents Apollo Apollonovich: as a weak little man with enormous ears and the wings of a bat, sitting on a sleep- ing female figure in a fish-like position, wearing Russian national dress. The sleeping woman conjures up the struggle of both the historical Po- bedonostsev and the literary Ableukhov to check revolutionary tenden- cies and maintain the status quo. Their anthropomorphic associations move them along a vertical line in diverging directions: the wings of the bat, an animal of the air (Ableukhov), is juxtaposed with the fish, linked linguistically to Lippanchenko's name (Fishelvich). Both are intertwined in AbleukhoVs daily habits: his favorite place is the water closet, and his first act, after the attempt to usurp him, was to clean the "yellow dust" from the books of his library. 'Yellow dust" turns out to be not only a geographical reference, but also a temporal one: to the "yellow dust of our exhausted culture" from The Birth of Tragedy , as Maguire and Malmstad point out (112). (Although one should realize that in Nietz- sche's German text this dust is red). Like the "saffron-yellow atmo- sphere," the "yellow dust" has geographical resonances in the form of an Eastern invasion that Apollo Apollonovich cannot escape. The name Apollo, which refers directly to Nietzsche's notion of the "Apollonian," a concept of form that contrasts with the Dionysian concept of ecstasy and intoxication associated with the character of Lippanchenko, must face a disintegration into dust which amounts to the deformation of all form. 2.3. The Moneylender (Gogol) Dudkin's life in a shabby room on the top floor, which is referred to as a "habitation," is the equivalent of Zara- thustra's mountain (Maguire and Malmstad 126). Instead of returning from that mountain, following his shadow (described in Zarathustra as becoming thinner and thinner: "I am almost like a shadow" [qtd. in Maguire and Malmstad 129]), Dudkin is pushed higher along the spiral, transforming himself into a shadow-like figure as he casts his shadow. Distinctions dissolve in the spiraling movement enacted by Bely when the two strangers Dudkin and Shishnarfne unite in Dudkin's habitation. Bely had proclaimed this principle of dissolution at the end of the first chapter, in the following announcement to the reader: Vol. 28 (2004): 67</page><page sequence="16">YELLOW FIGURES IN PROUST ANV SELY Once his brain has playfully engendered the mysterious stranger, that stranger exists, really exists. He will not vanish from the Petersburg pros- pects as long as the senator with such thoughts exists, because thought exists too. So let our stranger be a real stranger! And let the two shadows of my stranger be real shadows! Those dark shadows will, oh yes, they will, follow on the heels of the stranger, just as the stranger himself is closely following the senator. The aged senator will, oh yes, he will, pursue you too, dear reader, in his black carriage. And henceforth you will never ever forget him! (36) Implicit in Bely's suggestive proclamation of a haunting force that will also captivate the reader is a criticism of Nietzsche (expressed in "Circu- lar Movement") in that he lets Zarathustra return from the mountain, instead of moving him higher up the spiral.15 With the dissolution of Shishnarfne, who like Zarathustra is Persian, Bely realizes the move higher up the spiral without return. This ascension up the spiral mani- fests itself as an anthropomorphism in the form of the Yellow Peril. After Dudkin visits Lippanchenko, he is followed up the stairs to his room by Shishnarfne, whom he had met at Lippanchenko's. In Dudkin's room Shishnarfne gradually becomes more insubstantial, eventually tak- ing over Dudkin's voice in the form of the word "Enfranshish" that Dudkin has repeatedly been hearing. In the course of this scene, Dudkin comes to realize that Enfranshish (the phrase "en franchise" that ap- pears on a box of French insect powder, which in the Cyrillic alphabet becomes Enfranshish) and Shishnarfne are inversions of each other: "And he understood: 'Shishnarfne - Shish-narfne ' From his vocal ap- paratus came the reply: You summoned me . . . Here I am. . . En- franshish had come for his soul" (208). The conversion of Shishnarfne into Enfranshish moves from the dissolution of sound to the transcrip- tion from French into Russian. The transformations are moving towards a killing force that turns people into animals. Just as the Oriental sound of Shishnarfne passes through the walls, the Mongolian face of Lippanchenko enters at night, becoming visible on the yellow wallpaper. This Mongolian face turns out to be the spot of a sow bug during daytime. Lippanchenko's suit reminded the stranger of the color of the yellow wallpaper in his habitation on Vasilievsky Island, a color associated with insomnia. That insomnia evoked the memory of a fateful face with veiy narrow little Mongol eyes. The face had looked repeatedly at him from the wallpaper. When he examined this place during the day, he could make out only a damp spot, over which crawled a sow bug. In order to distract himself from memories of the tormenting hallucination, he grew garrulous, to his own surprise. (26) This spectacle of a Mongolian face that appears in yellow spots on the wall is a citation from Gogol's The Portrait , in which a moneylender with oriental features appears on the wall. In this fashion the "fateful Mon- Vol. 28 (2004): 68</page><page sequence="17">THE COM9AKATIST golian face" that appears at night on the yellow walls is implicated in exchange value (gold as archetype, as universal equivalent). And thus the citation highlights the slippage (or alchemy) between yellow skin and gold: the exchange of incommensurable values is exhibited inside, at night, on the yellow walls of the garret; from dirt to gold, yellow endan- gers the stability of value systems.16 Yellow thereby turns into an inscription of the Yellow Peril, which Bely has brought to life in his quotations of yellow figures from Dostoev- sky, Gogol, and Nietzsche. The movement that culminates in the red flames of the Apocalypse occurs through a citation of Pushkin's Bronze Horseman, which, literally translated, is a "copper horseman." The red metal is the culminating point, taking on the color of flames, figuring the apocalypse. Whereas colors do symbolize an alchemical process in Peters- burg , leading from black, to white, to yellow, to the red of the apocalypse at the end, yellow is linked to the force of an "eternal return." 2.4. The Bronze Horseman (Pushkin) The destruction of Petersburg is prefigured in Dudkin's "extravagant little action," the killing of Lip- panchenko. In an act of will that moves further along the spiral - as Zarathustra was led by the dwarf- Dudkin is led to his action by Lip- panchenko with "his little Mongolian eyes" that looked at him during the night, enslaving his will. Dudkin is refused the knife he wanted to buy, and purchases instead a pair of scissors. Although their straight blades can cut through a circle, their circular handles become an emblem of the 'line/circle imagery" of Petersburg: "The straight line has become a circle, for madness is a circular condition" (Maguire and Malmstad 132). After killing Lippanchenko, Dudkin rides on his corpse; his act of will has ended in madness, which Bely describes as a circular condition. The yellow houses that Bely describes (a Russian euphemism for mad- houses) are turning Petersburg "saffron yellow." But a seeming libera- tion from the yellow peril has become a performance of madness; yellow turns reddish in the metal of the Bronze (Copper) Horseman as an apoc- alyptic rider performs the iron law of the eternal return: "Where are you galloping, proud steed, and where will you set down your hooves? Oh mighty master of fate! Was it not thus that you, on the very brink of the abyss on high, reared up Russia with your iron bridle?" (Bely 324). This passage is a citation from Pushkin's "Bronze Horseman," itself a parody of its protagonist (Evgeny's ride on a Hon). As Dudkin rides on Lippanchenko's corpse, a sow bug crawls across his face. In an association with the yellow wall on which the insect orig- inally appeared, the reappearance of the sow bug transforms itself into the image of yellow wall-paper, the surface on which Dudkin could see the Mongolian face haunting him at night. In leading back to the haunt- ing nightmare, the sow bug turns Dudkin himself into the circulation of the Yellow Peril. The alchemical process of yellowing does not simply move towards catastrophe, but toward an inscription of the Yellow Peril performed Vol. 28 (2004): 69</page><page sequence="18">YELLOW fIĢURES IM PROUST AMV BELY through a chain of citations exhibited in the features of the characters and in their immediate environment. The yellow figures in Petersburg are literary chromo-topes embedded in the historical and political situ- ation of Petersburg at the turn of the century.17 * * * * In closing, I would like briefly to discuss Josef Albers' Homage to the Square: Departing in Yellow (1964), 18 which I see as a model for the chromo-tope. Albers, who started his career at the Bauhaus before emi- grating from Nazi Germany, says in his treatise 'Interactions of Colors" that the nuance is the exposition of detail in "permanent movement" (Gomringer 174). Albers uses the square as interior space, a place of self-reflection, a technique that will turn out to be shot through with chromo-topic issues. Even though the square is considered the most stable form, the form of foundations, Albers exposes its instability by way of nuances. Four squares are folded into each other, dyed in differ- ent nuances of yellow, which appear to move out towards the viewer; seen from a different perspective, they vanish in the opposite direction.19 Albers writes, "color is permanent movement, an aggression towards and away from the spectator [. . .] a breathing and pulsating in color" (Albers 174). To see is to have an insight into the act of seeing itself. Albers wants to trigger the act of seeing as worldview - as a perspective depend- ing on point of view. The slightest shift opens a different perspective on one and the same color. Albers moves inside the squares along vertical and horizontal axes, destabilizing the point of view of the spectator. The return in Nazi Germany of the yellow star, the emblem which made Albers leave the country, is inscribed in parentheses in the subtitle "(Departing in yellow)." We might make a connection here between Al- bers' work and what Bakhtin calls "living artistic perception." Chromo- topes are not given, but rather are produced in the act of reading in which nuances become visible; yet they cannot be abstracted from con- crete manifestations in time and place. As we have seen, yellow chromo-topes reveal the ambivalence of the color yellow as the product of temporal and geographical displacement in modernist texts. At once the color of light, enlightenment and value, yellow is also the color of degradation, threat, abjection, and fate. This ambivalence figures the ambivalence of modernism itself, caught up in the great conflict between Romantic nostalgia and a bleak futurism, between hope and fear, ecstasy and madness.

Early Christian theologians such as St. Augustine stressed a reading of the Bible that treated it as a record of events that really happened, as against the tendency to see it in mythical terms, as a series of allegories or symbols, thereby stripping it of historical validity. There was also the problem of how to connect the Old Testament with the New, since they appeared discontinuous both in terms of content and message. As St. Paul had spoken about the fulfillment of Old Testa- ment prophesies and events in the Gospels, thereby connecting Judaism with the life and teaching of Christ, an interpretation of the Bible, particularly of the relation between its two parts, was developed which allowed one event to be interpreted in light of another, later event. The earlier event was said to "prefigure" the later, which was in tum the fulfillment of the earlier one. This practice in fact represented a first attempt at historical interpretation: one event is seen as the figure of another; but this figuration never cancels the events' historicity or concreteness. 4 Il mourut dans les circonstances suivantes: Une crise d'urémie assez légère était cause qu'on lui avait prescrit le repos.

Dès les premières marches qu'il eut à gravir, il fut pris d'étourdissements. Il passa devant plusieurs tableaux et eut l'impression de la sécheresse et de l'inutilité d'un art si factice, et qui ne valait pas les courants d'air et de soleil d'un palazzo de Venise ou d'une simple maison au bord de la mer. Enfin il fut devant le Ver Meer, qu'il se rappelait plus éclatant, plus différent de tout ce qu'il connaissait, mais où, grâce à l'article du critique, il remarqua pour la première fois des petits personnages en bleu, que le sable était rose, et enfin la précieuse matière du tout petit pan de mur jaune . Ses étourdissements augmentaient; il attachait son regard, comme un en- fant à un papillon jaune qu'il veut saisir, au précieux petit pan de mur . "C'est ainsi que j'aurais dû écrire, disait-il. Mes demiers livres sont trop secs, il aurait fallu passer plusieurs couches de couleur, rendre ma phrase en elle-même précieuse, comme ce petit pan de mur jaune ." Cependant la gravité de ses étourdissements ne lui échappait pas. Dans une céleste balance lui apparaissait, chargeant l'un des pla- teaux, sa propre vie, tandis que l'autre contenait le petit pan de mur si bien peint en jaune. Il sentait qu'il avait imprudemment donné la première pour le second. "Je ne voudrais pourtant pas, se dit-il, être pour les journaux du soir le fait divers de cette exposition. Il se répétait: " Petit pan de mur jaune avec un auvent, petit pan de mur jaune ." Cependant il s'abattit sur un canapé circulaire ; aussi brusquement il cessa de penser que sa vie était enjeu et, revenant à l'optimisme, se dit: "C'est une simple indigestion que m'ont donnée ces pommes de terre pas assez cuites, ce n'est rien."

This section will explore how the Dreyfus Affair, the color yellow, and the temporal shift from 1902 to 1921 are interrelated. 0 My translation. "Durant l'année 1921, sa seul sortie mémorable fut pour aller visiter, en compagnie de l'écrivain Jean-Louis Vaudoyer, qu'il aimait bien, l'exposition de peinture hollandaise qui se tint au Jeu de paume, ce printemps-là [. . .] et ce fut surtout pour y revoir les tableaux de son cher Vermeer, et notamment le petit pan de mur jaune. Jean-Louis Vaudoyer était venu le prendre sur le coup de onze heures du matin. Autant qu'il m'en souvienne, il rentra vers le début de la soirée, épuise. Il avait eu des vertiges pendant la visite de l'exposition" (Picon 10). 7 The phrase "pan de mur" is a leitmotif in Balzac's Eugénie Grandet , and no doubt inspired Proust. Thus Proust's phrase can be interpreted as a citation of or intertextual reference to Balzac. For yellow is used throughout Balzac's novel to express the ambivalence between monetary and spiritual value. The female pro- tagonist, Eugénie, is a victim of her father's obsession with gold, exemplified in the exclamation, "J"aime le jaune," T love yellow' (199). Yellow is a figure of value, but of a kind of value that is ultimately revealed to be destructive. Balzac also inscribes the orientation of his characters in their names: Grandet is an anagram of / ' argent , and Eu [genie) means genius of the good. Both orientations indicate a self- destructive force that imprisons the characters. g Nevertheless, Bal does offer an interesting analysis of this passage: "Is it a yellow patch of wall or a patch of yellow wall? For the reader who attributes yellow to the wall, it is a detail; for the other who attributes it to the floating term 'patch,' it is related not to the referent, but to the act of painting. When applied to the paint- ing, the yellow is a patch of color, of paint in all its materiality. What we should retain from this patch is the fact that Bergotte was jealous of the yellow that kills him" (83). In her visual reading of Proust, Bal refers to paintings by Rembrandt, Chardin, Gaugin, and others, but does not, in referring to ¿he "yellow little patch of wall," make a link to a work by van Gogh. Fixing upon the abstraction of detail as a "patch" that is not visible in Vermeer's actual painting, Bal calls the patch a "dis- figure" that is "an effective surplus" (91). She links the yellow butterfly, which is a leitmotif in La Prisonnière , to Rembrandt's The Toilet of Bathsheba. Bal's comment on the detail "that details itself," and thus passes from referentiality to self-reflexivity, is the point of departure for our analysis of the "yellow patch of wall" in light of van Gogh's work. 9 As already noted, yellow was used to stigmatize Jews and prostitutes during Vol. 28 (2004): 72</page><page sequence="21">THE COMPAKATIST the Middle Ages. It continued to have this significance even in the nineteenth cen- tury; thus Victor Hugo refers to the "papier jaune" of Jean Valjean (78), which is the document that identified him as an ex-convict. As previously mentioned, in comparing his own style of writing with how Vermeer painted the "little yellow patch of wall" in the View of Delft , Bergotte concluded that he should have written like Vermeer painted. Van Gogh's still-life Lemons and Quince is thereby one of the first mono- chrome-yellow paintings. It is also a homage to Vermeeťs "citron-yellow," which van Gogh describes in a letter to Emile Bernard in 1888: "For instance, do you know a painter called Vermeer who has painted, among other things, a very beau- tiful pregnant Dutch lady? The palette of this strange painter is blue, citron yellow, pearl gray, black, white. There are certainly, on close examination, all the riches of a complete palette in his rare pictures; but the combination of citron yellow, pale blue, pearl gray is as characteristic of him as black, white, gray and pink are of Velasquez" (503-04). This set of colors returns in Bergotte's description of the View of Delft , in which the art critic's article makes him notice for the first time "some small figures in blue, that the sand was pink, and, finally, the precious sub- stance of the tiny patch of yellow wall" (244). If the name Bergotte is an echo of bergamot , the name of a citrus tree, thereby evoking Vermeer's lemon-yellow, van Gogh's Lemons and Quinces relates even more directly to Vermeer. 12 In his later works, Van Gogh's preference for, even obsession with, yellow is exemplified by the so-called "Yellow House" that he bought in the South of France. Its exterior was completely yellow and its interior walls were decorated with still-life paintings of yellow sunflowers. The Yellow House was meant as a meeting place for artists (and is thus the pendant to Bergotte's group of great artists on his journey to the "yellow patch of wall"). Gauguin, who lived with van Gogh in his "yellow room" for a short period of time, called the atmosphere "terribly electric" (Heinich 166). The story of van Gogh cutting off his ear and sending it to his lover, a prostitute, marks the end of his Yellow House period. After a series of breakdowns, he had to leave the house for the asylum in Saint-Remy de Provence. 13 That the book in question was not The Yellow Book with its scandalous reputation, but a French avant-garde novel that was published with "yellow backs," precipitated even more scandal. From the beginning Wilde was excluded from the list of authors whom Beardsley and Harland published in their Quarterly - a token of Beardsley's revenge, because Wilde had not accepted his translation of Salome. 14 And these caricatures come together in a collage of "saffron-yellow atmos- phere" (Bely 258). 15 "For Bely, the shadow presents a constant temptation to return, a temp- tation to which Zarathustra (and Nietzsche) yielded" (Maguire and Malmstad 127). 16 Freud's remark in his Interpretation of Dreams that displacements can tum a whole value system upside down describes the mechanism at work in Dudkin. 17 It is interesting to note that in 1941 the filmmaker Sergej Eisenstein, a one- time pupil of Bely's, wrote (in a similar though more outspoken way) a "Rhapsody in Yellow" against his compatriot Kandinsky.

He wams that Kandinsky's approach, in which colors and forms have a fixed, one-dimensional meaning, might bring a rapprochement with "our fascist neighbors" (1 14), a return on "yellow paths" to "medieval darkness" (136). 18 For a readily accessible reproduction of this painting, see Josef Alters. 19 For more on the square in the painting of Albers, Malevich, and Kandin- sky, see Albrecht 100.
