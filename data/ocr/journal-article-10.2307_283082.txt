POST HAVERFORD COLLEGE The strongest argument against those who assume a multiple authorship of the Homeric poems is the unity that is apparent in them. The parts fit into a pattern to which they are obviously adapted and without which neither parts nor whole would be effective literary works. This is true not only of each epic separately but of Iliad and Odyssey together. The latter poem is not an imitation of the former but a comple- ment.1 The distinctive features of the Odyssey are not new, 1 For this point see S. E. Bassett, The Poetry of Homer (Berkeley, U. of California Press, 1938), 174-6. I am greatly indebted to this book for many points and fully agree with the author's analysis of character and dramatic moments, except where divine action is introduced. Bassett has refuted the sentimentalized view of Achilles as sinful and repentant that is found in C. M. Bowra, Tradition and Design in the Iliad (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1930). Such an Achilles comes not from Homer, but from the court of King Arthur- not the real Arthur or the Arthur of Mallory, but the Arthur of Tennyson, who splashes morality on the most unlikely characters. To attribute to Achilles, as Bowra does (page 141), the silly defense of Agamemnon (II. xix.86f.), which he lamely produces in place of an apology, is no worse than attributing to Homer (page 229) a solution of the problem of error that satisfied the base Agamemnon. It is true only in a special sense that "Achilles accepts" Agamemnon's explanation. Achilles has renounced his anger and regretted the quarrel before Agamemnon speaks. He still considers that Agamemnon is to blame, however, for his regret is not repentance. The king began the quarrel, as Odysseus points out (xix.183) and Agamemnon confesses (II.378). Agamemnon's "Fury that walketh in darkness" is fairly inappropriate, as Bowra says, but it is just the kind of nonsense that one expects from the stupid person who will not frankly admit an error. Agamemnon begins his speech with a reproof to the Achaeans that shows that they started to applaud Achilles long before he finished his speech. In fact Agamemnon cuts such a poor figure that he tries to avoid addressing the assembly at all, keeping his seat and directing his remarks to Achilles. This is the interpretation of this passage that is given by A. T. Murray in the Loeb edition. In the formal ceremony of reconciliation Achilles must as a matter of form (xix.270-5) release Agamemnon from blame by attributing his ate to the will of Zeus. Our own law still uses</page><page sequence="2">Vol. lxx] The Moral Pattern in Homer 159 but are already found, less prominently to be sure, in the Iliad. It is my purpose in this article to study the moral pattern in the two poems and to note the influence of moral considera- tions on Homer's handling of his characters and incidents.2 It will be found that there are many slight variations that are evidently the result of design, that the moral pattern of the Odyssey is not so much an innovation as a concentration on themes that are foreshadowed in the Iliad, and that the divine machinery is demonstrably used by the poet to enhance the dramatic qualities of his heroes. Drama is action, and action is composed of aspiration, futility, decision, indecision, struggle, circumstance, suspense, and achievement or failure. The tragic plot of the Iliad condemns to death two noble characters, Hector and Achilles. The nobility of this pair is emphasized by contrasted opposites whom it will be convenient to call villains, namely Paris and Agamemnon. The conflict between Hector and Achilles can- not begin until the conflict of Agamemnon and Achilles is settled. At that point Paris has already been forgotten by the poet, so that the villains leave the stage before the con- flict of heroes begins. In the Odyssey, however, there is but one conflict, that between hero and villains, and the story ends with the unavenged slaughter of the latter. This is the explanation of Aristotle's statement that the Iliad is tragic, while the Odyssey is ethical in its plot.3 The morality of the plot of the Odyssey is indeed trans- parent. This renders it totally unlike the Iliad in its effect. In the Odyssey the hero and his family are as nearly flawless as possible. They are persecuted by the suitors, whose evil the term "act of God" to indicate the absence of any human responsibility for damage. Achilles' prayer is neither theological nor religious; it is pure legal diplomacy and should be recognized as such. 2 J. T. Sheppard in The Pattern of the Iliad (London, Methuen, 1922) con- siders the aesthetic pictorial pattern of the Iliad almost exclusively, but his excellent flair for the play of character and humor illuminates many dramatic points. 3 Poetics xxiv.3.59b.15. The moral plot is fully discussed in my article "Aristotle and Menander," Trans. Am. Philol. Assn. LXIX (1938), 1-42.</page><page sequence="3">160 L. A. Post [1939 behavior is so emphasized that no reader can feel pity when they are slain. Furthermore the final triumph of the good is assured by the will and active cooperation of the gods. Besides all this, the poet makes his moral intent unmistakable by repeated references to the story of Agamemnon, which provides a lesson and a contrast. Faithless Clytemnestra is compared with loyal Penelope, and Orestes' vengeance is held up as a pattern for Telemachus.4 The action of the Odyssey starts with Zeus' comment on the death of Aegisthus. He points the moral that mortals may bring evil upon them- selves.5 The gods could not be blamed for Aegisthus' fate, since they had sent Hermes to warn him not to woo Clytem- nestra nor to slay Agamemnon. The occasion is at once seized by Athena to plead for her favorite Odysseus. We 4 Clytemnestra is mentioned in Od. iii.266 and specifically contrasted with Penelope at xi.421-446 and xxiv.192-202. Orestes' revenge is mentioned at i.30. Athena and Nestor urge Telemachus to emulate Orestes' glorious action at i.301 and iii.199f. Again Odysseus at xiii.383-5 is grateful to Athena for saving him from the fate of Agamemnon. 6 This passage is discussed by Werner Jaeger, "Solons Eunomie," Sitzb. Akad. Berlin, phil.-hist. Klasse (1926), 69-85. In Paideia (tr. by Gilbert Highet, Oxford, Blackwell; N. V., Oxford U. Press, 1939), 12, Jaeger concludes that the Odyssey is late, since it includes such advanced philosophy. But the same idea is tacitly present in the Iliad, though it could not appropriately be expressed there. Much that I have to say is in disagreement with Jaeger, largely because he uses Homeric material without a preliminary analysis of dramatic and literary motives. I do not agree that "the morality of the Odyssey is universally on a much higher plane" (p. 22); it is more conventional, to be sure. It is merely courtesy to Helen when Priam (not "the Trojan elders" as Jaeger says, p. 21) blames the gods for her sin (II. iii.164). Nor is it true that "Homer takes no sides in Book I" (p. 47); he shows a god inspiring Achilles (i.55), while Agamemnon disregards the shouted approval of the army (i.24), as well as the advice of Nestor (i.275). I should suppose that Paris and Helen would be a living refutation of the statement (p. 34) that "in early Greek thought there was no separation between ethics and aesthetics." And is it right to call Achilles "an aristocrat" (p. 8), when in Homer he is the only adherent of his particular code? No doubt Homer was familiar with some military code comparable to that of the Jomsvikings or others mentioned by A. J. Toynbee in A Study of History2 (Oxford, University Press, 1935), II.99. This is obviously not at all the same as an aristocratic code, for that is a code of rulers, not of soldiers. In any case Achilles is depicted in the Iliad as an isolated individual, not a member of a class.</page><page sequence="4">Vol. lxx] The Moral Pattern in Homer 161 learn later that there are men wooing his wife and planning to kill him-precisely the sin of Aegisthus. Athena proposes to send Hermes, not to warn the suitors, but to secure Odys- seus' release from Calypso's island. Provision is made for warning the suitors by Athena herself, who will go to Ithaca and inspire Telemachus to assert himself and to give notice to them that they must desist or take the consequences. This he does both privately (i.378-80) and publicly (ii.143-5), invoking as he does so the protection of the gods. Dreams and omens throughout the poem are favorable to the hero and unfavorable to the suitors. The gods are universally hostile to the suitors, and give Odysseus nothing but help after the wrecking of his ship by Poseidon on the way to Phaeacia, his last stop before Ithaca. It would obviously have detracted from the human interest of the story if Hermes had actually warned the suitors as he is said to have warned Aegisthus. Apart from Telemachus and other human agents they are warned only through omens, which it is always possible for a wicked or foolish man to disregard. The presence of a moral in the tale of Odysseus and the suitors is, however, less remarkable than the total absence of a serious moral in the part of the Odyssey that is related by the hero in the first person (ix-xii). We know that Poseidon was angry with Odysseus until he reached Ithaca (i.20f.) and that Athena helped Odysseus only after the council of the gods. She appeared to him openly on!ly in Ithaca when Poseidon had ceased to oppose him.6 It is a little odd that Hermes had not feared to help Odysseus openly (x.277) in the adventure with Circe, but we have only Odysseus' word for that. In general, Odysseus in his own person is aware of the action of the gods only when he deduces it from his experience. When the sea is violent, Poseidon is to blame 6 Help in Poseidon's absence, at sea and in Phaeacia: v.382-7, 427, 491-3; vi.13-47, 323-31; vII.14-81; viii.7-15, 193-9; xiii.121, 302. In xiii.312-28 we hear that Odysseus had not seen Athena or observed that she was helping him between the sack of Troy and his arrival in Phaeacia,</page><page sequence="5">162 L. A. Post [1939 (vii.271); Zeus sends the winds (ix.67; xII.405). Odysseus knows that Zeus did not hear a certain prayer, because events did not turn out as he had prayed (ix.553-5). When he is lucky or unlucky, Zeus or a god or fate may be considered responsible (x.141, 157; xII.295, 445). Naturally in the hard- luck story that Odysseus relates to Eumaeus in book XIV there are frequent references to the gods as givers of good or bad fortune (198, 242f., 268, 303, 310, 357). Obviously Odys- seus must talk like a beggar as well as look like one. Once Odysseus knows of divine action because Calypso told him about it (xii.389f.). The divine machinery that the poet describes so vividly is normally invisible to his human actors; they know only what they see and hear.7 Homer's device of letting a hero relate some of his adven- tures in the first person has been superficially imitated by later poets, but the supreme ingenuity of his device and its relation to his moral pattern seem to have been insufficiently appreciated. The gods do not intervene in favor of Odysseus until the tenth year of his travels. As Athena says (i.59f.), Zeus gave no heed to Odysseus before the council of book I. The poet's plan required his reader to overlook this absence of divine assistance, and this is rendered possible because we hear of events only from Odysseus, who in any case could not know what the gods were saying and doing. The story could be moralized only if it opened at the exact moment when divine intervention could plausibly be represented as beginning. Poseidon's anger after the blinding of Polyphemus does not explain the earlier difficulties of Odysseus, and in any case it is only a frivolous fairy-story motivation. That the wrath of Poseidon was not morally justified, but was mere I Compare 0. J0rgensen, "Das Auftreten der Gotter in den Buchern L-/ der Odyssee," Hermes XXXIX (1904), 337-82; E. Heden, Homerische Gotter- studien (Diss., Upsala), 1912. Uvo Holscher explains the apologia of Odysseus in the first person otherwise. According to him it is the contrast in atmosphere and time that the poet prefers to keep distinct.

They attach no importance to Poseidon's rage and propose to help Odysseus in spite of him. He is no spiteful Juno, such as we find in the Aeneid. If Homer had not made Poseidon relent, the Odyssey would be no more moral than the Aeneid. The blinding of Polyphemus was richly deserved, as Odysseus asserts (ix.479). Before the adventure with the Cyclops there is no apparent reason in Homer why the hero should have any difficulty at all. In this Homer displays his usual ingenuity, for the only possible explanation of Odysseus' misfortunes was discreditable and would, if it had been emphasized, have disqualified him for his role of divine favorite and flawless protagonist that he must play in Ithaca. The usual story of the return of the Achaeans attributed their sufferings to the anger of Athena, Zeus, and Poseidon, which was aroused by the violation of temples at the sack of Troy. Instead of moralizing this part of the story Homer gives us Odysseus' own account of what happened to him. It is not surprising that his account not only omits divine machinery but represents Odysseus as a faultless hero, bearing with fortitude and resource hardships that are quite undeserved, as far as he personally is concerned. Thus there is no stain on Odysseus' character when he arrives in Ithaca, so that the audience can give him their full sym- pathy with no misgivings about his doubtful past. He is the hero of the Odyssey; since he was punished by the gods in the Nostoi, that story had to be revised or suppressed in the interest not of truth but of fiction.8 8 The Nostoi was a gloomy song (i.326f., 340f.) of the woeful return from Troy inflicted upon the Greeks by Athena. Nestor couples Zeus with Athena as responsible for the woes of the Achaeans (iii.130-6). The fate of Locrian Ajax was due to Poseidon's anger when the god received no credit for letting Ajax escape the sea in spite of Athena's wrath (iv.499-511). Hermes' version (v.108f.) makes Athena in her anger at the Achaeans send a tempest upon them. In the prologue of Euripides' Trojan Women, Athena enlists Poseidon's aid in punishing the Greeks because they had let Ajax violate Cassandra when she sought refuge at Athena's shrine.</page><page sequence="7">164 L. A. Post [1939 The moral theme of the Odyssey, divine vengeance on the sinner, is not new. Zeus says at Od. i.32-4 that mortals blame the gods for troubles that they have brought on them- selves. This does not mean that all mortals always blame the gods. The idea of punishment for sin and folly is thor- oughly familiar in the Iliad. "They perished by their own blind folly" is a statement found in the Iliad (iv.109, cf. xxii.104) as well as in the Odyssey (I.7). Violation of oaths or of the code of hospitality was expected to bring vengeance from Zeus (II. iii.350-4; iv.153-68; vii.351-3; xiii.620-7; xvi.386-8). Since the Odyssey concentrates exclusively on a conventional moral theme, it is appropriately introduced by a dogma of Zeus that emphasizes the responsibility of the sinner and the fact that punishment is deserved. This doc- trine applies, however, only to the central plot. Helen is not punished in the Odyssey any more than in the Iliad. The fact that the Iliad is never corrected or criticized in the Odyssey and that its statements are accepted as true, is a strong argument for unity of authorship. As a rule in Homer, only enemies or sinners are blamed for their own misfortunes. If misfortune is undeserved, it is attributed, whether by Homer or by his characters, to Zeus or the gods, or to fate, or to Ate personified. Similarly when one character says to another, "I blame the gods, not you, for what has occurred," it is always an indication of a friendly attitude. Such a statement throws no light on anyone's theological views; it tells us only that the speaker is not dis- posed to snub or rebuke the person addressed. It is in fact a polite formula for courteously ignoring the plight of one who is morally or socially at a disadvantage. It makes no difference whether fate or the gods are blamed, since for human observers fate and the gods are indistinguishable in their effect. The gods, to be sure, make fate their scapegoat when action would be inconvenient for the poet; one god may also be to blame for the inaction of others. In English, " it's hard luck" and "it's God's will" express about the same degree</page><page sequence="8">Vol. lxx] The Moral Pattern in Homer 165 of sympathy with one who is in trouble. With such formulas Priam comforts Helen (II. IIi.164), Nausicaa encourages Odys- seus (Od. vi.187-90), Odysseus conciliates Ajax (Od. xI.558- 60), and Telemachus excuses the bard who sings sad songs (Od. i.348). Achilles uses the same formula to seal his re- nunciation of wrath (II. xix.270-5). He had to give assurance that he no longer had a quarrel with Agamemnon, for Aga- memnon had made atonement and Patroclus must be avenged. Hence Achilles solemnly declares that Agamemnon's treat- ment of him was an "act of God." Can anyone imagine him expressing any such sentiment before the atonement? What he says then is: av'ro's arovpas (i.356). The fact that Zeus took away Agamemnon's wits does not save the king from Achilles' anger at ix.367-77. On the same principle, one who wishes to be rude will detract from another's glory by attributing his good fortune or prowess to the gods. This is Agamemnon's technique with Achilles (i.178). Again, when a man who is liable to be blamed or scorned, is defending or recommending himself, it is only natural that he should attribute his own misdeeds or misfortune to Zeus, fate, or the gods. Anything, no matter what, may be spoken of as their doing either by the poet or by his characters. Where actual misdeeds, however, not mere misfortunes, are concerned, there is an important distinction to be made: strong characters take the responsibility for their own decisions, however much they may regret them; no one of course accepts responsibility for bad luck. Achilles has regrets but never excuses for past conduct. Helen knows her own shame and feels keenly the moral indig- nation of others (Il. iii.180, 242 , 410-3; vi.344; Od. iv.145); only once does she hint that her sin was the will of Zeus (Il. vi.357). In Homer as in life, it is the stronger characters who do not shirk the consequences of their own acts. Paris, in contrast to Helen, is lightly content, regardless of reproaches, to be the giddy favorite of Aphrodite, whose gifts, so he says, he has no power to refuse (II. iii.64-6). It does not occur to</page><page sequence="9">166 L. A. Post [1939 him to repent or to make atonement. Hector, like a hero, accepts responsibility for his own bad judgment and would rather fight Achilles than listen to deserved reproaches in Troy (Il. xxii.99-110). Agamemnon, who is the feeblest character in the Iliad, excuses his treatment of Achilles by telling a long story about Ate and saying that he had been made her victim by Zeus and fate and Erinys (Il. xix.85-136). Thus he seeks to save his face while offering satisfaction. His imposing quadruple array of ghostly scapegoats is equalled by Elpenor, the half-witted, in the Odyssey (x.553; xi.61); he manages in a single line to combine atcra, AT-0, ba,L4xv, and oi'vos, in one befuddled excuse for his own mortal fall: afe AE laLpovos atoaa KaKfl KacL &amp;iao aroS ot'os. This is about as funny as Onesimus' philosophy in Menander (Ep. 729-41, K6rte). To take such a passage as serious evidence of an author's philosophy is bound to produce ludi- crous results. Homer is not a theologian, nor are his char- acters; but they make such use as they can of theology and philosophy to further their own practical interests. Homer with delightful humor shows us all grades of intelligence and honesty in references to fate and the gods, as in other fields.9 9 Disregard of this point vitiates the conclusions of Christian Voigt, Uber- legung und Entscheidung (Berlin, Panverlag, 1934). He does not consider decisions unless Homer explicitly says that his characters deliberate. Since a strong character like Achilles does not normally hesitate before a decision, he gets credit only for the decision that is made for him by Athena in Iliad I. This is even worse than Voigt's misinterpretation of the repeated line I76e 6k oL KaTar Ovpi6v &amp;pLTr?T7 4adVEeTO #o06XI. The notion of choice is not necessarily present in q5alvsro but it is perfectly explicit in &amp;plcri7. Only ignorance of Greek idiom can explain Voigt's notion (p. 26) that 4alvero can mean "it showed itself suddenly." For that the aorist is required. One can see a plan as the best only when it so appears in com- parison with all other plans that present themselves. It is quite inconsistent with Homer's statement to suppose that one plan presented itself " pl6tzlich" to the exclusion of others. The poet chose a brief statement because he had to get on with his story if he was to hold his audience. Achilles is certainly depicted as a free agent in the moment when he chose glory and honor in preference to life and property. Bassett (op. cit., see note 1, page 185) well</page><page sequence="10">Vol. lxx] The Moral Pattern in Homer 167 In his own introduction of gods Homer has no more scruples than some of his characters. It is his business to make fiction convincing, and he finds the divine machinery helpful. Since Helen is to be restored to her home after the action of the Iliad, the poet uses Aphrodite as a scapegoat and makes it abundantly clear that Helen was only briefly a willing victim (Ii. iii.380-447). In the Odyssey, not only Helen but Penel- ope, who does not name her, accepts the orthodox version that Aphrodite was really to blame (Od. iv.261f.; xxiii.218-24). Other characters curse Helen roundly or class her plainly as a bad woman (Od. xi.384; xiv.68). Telemachus, having seen her, naturally casts the blame on the gods (Od. xvii.119). Thus Homer gives us a very lifelike effect of a Helen who is enigmatic, technically bad, but noble and repentant at the same time. Menelaus, in referring to a particularly disloyal act of hers, when she imitated the voices of the wives of those Achaeans who were in the wooden horse, in order to betray them, gallantly apologizes by asserting that some daimon must have commanded her to act so (Od. iv.274f.). Thus a story creditable to Odysseus but discreditable to Helen may be introduced. The story that Helen herself tells of Odysseus is of course highly creditable to her as well as to him (Od. iv.240-64). Homer as poet uses the same technique in intro- ducing an incident rather discreditable to Penelope, the device of dressing in her best to inspire the suitors with love and so obtain gifts from them. Athena gave her the idea and made her miraculously beautiful (Od. xviii.158-197). In the same way Achilles is insulated against criticism twice when he calls an assembly. He is prompted once by Hera (II. i.55) and once by Thetis (xix.28-36). compares his statement in Iliad ix.410-6 to Prodicus' story of the choice of Heracles (Xen. Mem. ii.1.21-34). The machinery of decision was not explained by Homer any more than it is possible to explain it now. Homer shows us characters who act with decision and characters who are indecisive, bad char- acters and good. He certainly depicts moral choice and responsibility in a convincing way, which is all that we have a right to expect of a writer of fiction.</page><page sequence="11">168 L. A. Post [1939 The action of the gods is so varied in Homer that no one theory will explain more than a small proportion of the cases. His gods have many functions, among them that of assisting the poet with difficulties of plot or character. Telemachus' recognition of his father and the preservation of Hector's body absolutely require divine intervention. Homer makes his machinery inconspicuous by pretending that it is merely ornamental. There are divine scenes in heaven or on earth that are entertaining in themselves and have no effect whatever on the action. Again the gods are often mere masks for fate, and act in any of the triple roles of fate: birth, skill, and luck- in modern terms: heredity, education, and circumstance. Ares and Athena make a man bold (Od. xiv.216); Aphrodite gives a man charm among women (II. iii.54f.); Hermes makes him a good thief (Od. xix.396). Luck may be due to an un- defined power or to a god acting on behalf of a favorite hero or in the interest of his own party in a conflict. Aphrodite helps Paris (II. iII.375) by breaking the strap of his helmet; in the horse race (II. xxiii.384, 392), Apollo and Athena help their favorites Eumelus and Diomed by causing accidents to happen in each case to the rival driver. The gods have their playful moments, and their play is sometimes death to men. Athena helps Odysseus to win a foot race (II. xxiii.774). Even in the field of moral action partisan gods may see to it that the other party is involved in deeper sin and so doomed more certainly to destruction: Zeus orders Athena to prompt Pandarus to break the truce (II. iv.68-72); in the Odyssey (xviii.346-8; xx.285-7) she makes the suitors add to their guilt. Generally, however, the gods have a good moral in- fluence, exercised for the benefit of their favorite heroes. Zeus in particular is normally expected to interfere only in a good cause and after due deliberation. Thoughts and im- pulses are sent by the gods both to friends and to foes. Here their sphere of action is strictly psychological. With such an array of gods as instruments to be used at will, whether as natural forces, as specialists in temperament or skill, as bigoted</page><page sequence="12">Vol. lxx] The Moral Pattern in Homer 169 friends or foes, or as inspirers of physical, mental, or moral achievement, it is not surprising that to one scholar it seems that Homer's divinities are nothing but machines, to another that there are no miracles that could not equally well have been described without the intervention of the gods.'0 There is an alternative to these views-to assume that the Greek epics are not the work of simple-minded believers, of conventional bards, and of pious editors, but of a literary genius who found or created an immense variety of methods and used them all, as he needed them, for his own literary ends. The Iliad, as it stands, is a miracle. To date the miracle in the dim past is not to explain it but to adopt the principle: omne ignotum pro magnifico. Since the gods sometimes appear in Homer when they obviously are not needed, the credulous may be led to conclude that there is never any necessity for their appearance. When the gods intervene as masks for luck or skill or character, they accomplish only what would have happened anyway; so much is clear. The gods get a compli- mentary recognition that the pious man recognizes to be their due. Probably to Homer's contemporaries it was as important to recognize Apollo, Hermes, Athena, and Aphrodite as patrons of soothsaying, heraldry, textiles, and sex as it is to modern 10 On the varied treatment of the gods in Homer see G. M. Calhoun, "The Higher Criticism on Olympus," A.J.P. LVIII (1937), 257-74, and "Homer's Gods: Prolegomena," T.A.P.A. LXVIII (1937), 11-25. Among "the intricate patterns of the poet's artistry", to which scholars must attend before they " attempt to reconstruct a Homeric theology," is included, I suppose, the moral pattern. For Diedrich Muilder's view that divine action in Homer is always machinery and not nature, see the article "Ilias" in Pauly-Wissowa (ix.1022). According to Walter Leaf (Homer and History [London, Macmillan, 1915], 17), the gods are an "epiphenomenon." In general, scholars who are interpreting the Homeric poems as literary unities (Romer, Rothe, etc.) emphasize the poet's use of the gods for his own technical purposes, while students of religion like W. F. Otto (Die Gotter Griechenlands, Bonn, Cohen, 1929) tend to ignore any artificiality in the divine scenes of Homer. That literary gods are inevitably anthropomorphic is pointed out by A. C. Schlesinger in " The Literary Necessity of Anthropomorphism," Class. Jour. XXXII (1936), 19-26. The use of the gods to foreshadow coming events is treated by George E. Duckworth, Foreshadowing and Suspense in the Epics of Homer, Apollonius, and Vergil (Princeton U. Pr., 1933).</page><page sequence="13">170 L. A. Post [1939 workmen to have a labor union or a name, like realtor or mortician, that will add lustre to their occupations. It is in the psychological field that divine intervention is subject to dispute and that it is most difficult to detect the advantage that Homer found in using machinery. That he is capable of depicting inward conflict and decision without a god is clear enough in Iliad X VIII, where Achilles is moved by the death of Patroclus to renounce his quarrel with Agamem- non and to take vengeance on Hector at the cost of his own life. Thetis' presence adds to the effect, not by anv psycho- logical influence, but because only she can convey to Achilles the knowledge that his death will come soon after Hector's. The poet, not Achilles, needed the goddess in order to show Achilles unmoved by the certain prospect of death. By this artifice Homer achieves what is dramatically the most intense moment of the Iliad. There are many other lively emotional scenes in both epics that are depicted without divine assistance. The recognition scene between Odysseus and Penelope in Odyssey XXIII could not be bettered, as it depicts the shock that Penelope receives when she finds herself married to an old warrior in place of the young hero that she sent away, and her gradual adjustment until the common memory of the marriage-bed blots out the intervening years in a joyous reunion. We may get an insight, I believe, into Homer's methods in the field of character and morals by noting a difference in the nature of the help given to the heroes of the Iliad and to those of the Odyssey. In the latter poem the gods do not normally appear as restraining influences. When Melanthius kicks the disguised Odysseus, the hero needs no divine aid to subdue his rage (Od. xvii.238). So when he observes the misdeeds of the serving women (xx.6-24), he controls himself unaided. Again when he has to ponder before deciding what method to use in any case, he has no difficulty in choosing for himself the cunning, less impulsive, course. He does not seize Nausicaa's knees; he does not slay Irus; he does not embrace his father</page><page sequence="14">Vol. lxx] The Moral Pattern in Homer 171 at once (vi.145; xviii.93; xxiv.239). In these cases the formula is: W&amp;Se 66 ot eppovJ4ovTL SoaTcoTe Kp&amp;tOV EtPvat, which accdrding to Voigt (op. cit. [see note 9], page 43) is used to indicate the choice of a better alternative to the first impulse to act. Penelope likewise resists the impulse to embrace Odysseus at once (xxiii.86f.). Athena may of course outline a prudent course to Odysseus and give him needed information, but he is never represented as recalled from an imprudent course by her intervention. At the end of the story, to be sure, Athena and Zeus halt his attack on the already fleeing party of avengers, but this is obviously a meaningless flourish to enable the gods to end the tale by an impressive intervention with final reconciliation and peace (xxiv.537-48). Athena usually appears, whether to Odysseus, to Penelope, or to Telemachus, as an instigator to action or a dispeller of gloom. Note the use of aapcros or A,fvos or their cognates at Od. i.89, 321; xiii.323, 362, 387; xxiv.448. Omens and dreams sent for the comfort of Odysseus and his family are also frequent. It is significant that in the Iliad the case is normally, or frequently at least, the opposite. In this poem the heroes are naturally courageous, like the fictitious Cretan who is described in the Odyssey (xiv.216-28). Achilles needs no omens to encourage him nor any divine inspiration to be valiant. Where honor is concerned, he does not even deliberate after Iliad I- Thetis gives him sympathy, practical aid, and information, but never influences his decisions. Hector also is brave to a fault. He disregards an omen and even the reappearance of Achilles, though the wise Polydamas recommends caution (II. xii.210-29; xviii.259-83). In Iliad xx.375-454, only Apollo can restrain him from encountering Achilles. In book XXII, to be sure, he cannot long face Achilles and is induced to do so after his flight only by a trick of Athena, but Andro- mache had ample justification for her prediction that his courage would slay him (vi.407). Similarly, when there is</page><page sequence="15">172 L. A. Post [1939 divine intervention in the case of Achilles, the effect is normally to restrain or delay him. In his assault on the Trojans, for instance, Apollo delays his meeting with Hector (xx.75-80). Achilles is indeed reassured by the gods Poseidon and Athena in the Odyssean manner when the river Scamander is about to overwhelm him (xxi.284-97). When, however, there are moral decisions to be made, Achilles acts for himself un- prompted save by rage, honor, or revenge; his own fiery charac- ter needs no reinforcement. When Achilles is likely to commit suicide, desire for revenge gives him the will to live (xviii.34, 90-93). In the similar case of Odysseus it is patience that triumphs (Od. x.49-55). Twice Achilles obeys the gods, in the first and in the last book of the Iliad. In both cases they act to halt the course of his furious resentment. Evidently Homer uses the divine machinery in strict accord with the requirements of character. When a hero's ruling passion supplies a motive, divine aid is not summoned. It is Achilles who is exalted in the Iliad, not the gods; in the Odyssey it is Athena who takes the lead. The gods are needed only when Achilles must be patient or Odysseus rash and imprudent. Odysseus trusts Athena to arrange for the slaughter of the suitors, an attitude of piety that permitted Homer to surprise Penelope herself as well as the poet's audience when the act was suddenly accomplished." As far as Achilles' decisions are concerned, the usual rule of tragedy is followed limiting divine appearances to prologue and epilogue; in book I, Achilles had to act with restraint, for if he had slain Agamemnon in the quarrel, or if he had gone home with his army, as he threatened to do, there would have been an end to the story. The course he actually took, of refusing to fight and waiting for Agamemnon's pride to be crushed by complete defeat and loss of face, was suggested to him by Athena. She urged the motive of gain, asserting that he would obtain in compensation thrice as much as he lost 11 The plot of the Odyssey is brilliantly analyzed by W. J. Woodhouse, The Composition of Homer's Odyssey (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1930).</page><page sequence="16">Vol. lxx] The Moral Pattern in Homer 173 (i.210-14). Achilles obeys at once; many scholars assume that Athena is merely a personification of his own prudent reflection. This is possible because of Homer's cleverness in making his hero obey the divine command instantly without an argument. It is just the opposite of this art that conceals art when Vergil represents Aeneas (Aeneid iv.361) as finding it difficult to obey Jupiter and quit Dido. The divine com- mand becomes too prominent as a motive. Odysseus has a natural desire to return home; Aeneas seeks an unknown resi- dence when all his interests and memories would hold him back. When Achilles is checked by a god, he at once in the most natural way proceeds to act as if on his own initiative, not reluctantly, but playing his part with the utmost dramatic verisimilitude. Hence it is easy to miss the point that the poet has his own poetic reason for not letting Achilles himself make the decision whether to slay Agamemnon or not. It is not a very serious objection to the psychological in- terpretation of Athena's intervention that she supplies infor- mation not otherwise obtainable when she assures Achilles of the outcome. Her statement about compensation is suffi- ciently inexact to represent a reasonable human anticipation of results, for Achilles actually receives far more in compensa- tion than three times what he lost. The really fatal objection to a psychological interpretation is the fact that the motive urged by Athena, desire for riches, i-s one that would never have moved the natural Achilles of books IX and XIX. Nor indeed could it move him if he was to represent a noble military ideal.'2 Achilles' scorn for gifts as compensation for a slight 12 A view opposed to mine is ably represented by Martin P. Nilsson, " Gotter und Psychologie ,bei Homer," Archiv fur Religionswissenschaft xxii (1923/4), 363-90, especially 373ff. His argument seems to me to ignore Homer's ideal for the soldier. Nilsson urges the point that Achilles would have found himself in an impossible position if he had slain Agamemnon. That may well be true, but the point to be noted is that Achilles is represented as precisely the sort of person who does not consider consequences when honor is involved. Critics should study the samurai code in which honor is everything, while death and possessions are nothing in comparison. Achilles would of course have been as reluctant to return to Phthia as Agamemnon would have been to see him go.</page><page sequence="17">174 L. A. Post [1939 is well understood by Nestor. Nestor advised Agamemnon (Ii. ix.113) to pacify Achilles with gifts and by a speech of appeasement. When Agamemnon replies, Nestor drily re- marks that the offer of gifts is beyond criticism. The word 'gifts', however, is so emphasized that we are prepared for Achilles' refusal of them, a refusal couched in the most em- phatic terms (ix.378-92). Agamemnon should have gone in person to Achilles, but, for all his shamelessness, he cannot look Achilles in the face (ix.372f.). Achilles demands what Aga- memnon cannot give, frank and friendly partnership in honorable achievement. It is only in Iliad I in all Homer that a god interrupts a debate to change its course. The reason is that only here does Homer's plot require a hero to act out of character before the debate can go on. The unheroic motive must be attributed to a god or the moral pattern will suffer. Homer would rather introduce the complication of divine machinery than a complication of character that would spoil a clear-cut ideal of soldierly honor. In any military code the love of money is permitted, even less than pity or fear, to influence action against honor. Indifference to wealth accompanies indifference to the prospect of death and to pity in the code of Achilles as in that of the Japanese samurai. That Achilles could disregard the appeal of pity is clear when we realize the plight of his father and his son (Ii. xix.319-27), but in his case the poet makes little of resistance to pity. Since Hector's father, mother, wife, and son can appeal to him in person (vi.390-493; xxii.38-92), the theme of resistance to pity is centered on him in the Iliad. Achilles is tempted by gifts; Phoenix would have taken them, and so might Achilles if he had been Phoenix. As it is, he expresses scorn of them on every occasion (ix.431; xix.147f.). The poet himself is a little shocked in one case when a hero Glory was to be won at Troy if anywhere. Students of philosophy and religion need to be warned against the mistake of supposing that Homer was writing truth either psychological or philosophical. He was writing fiction, and his audiences were not captious about means, as long as he held them spellbound.</page><page sequence="18">Vol. lxx] The Moral Pattern in Homer 175 disregards the lure of wealth. He can only suppose that Zeus has made Glaucus mad (II. vi.234-6). Homer is, however, too honest an observer ever to depict a real hero as deserting his code of honor for bribes. He knows what heroes are like, but obviously feels more at ease with the rather grasping tem- perament of Athena and Odysseus. The dramatist is not necessarily as noble as his noblest characters. Achilles' indifference to death is expressed. as strongly as his indifference to property (II. xvii.95-116), where the code of vengeance is involved. When Achilles accepts the gifts of Agamemnon, the transfer is made for Agamemnon's sake rather than for Achilles'. Similarly, when the ransom of Hector is accepted, Patroclus is represented as interested in the gain and as receiving half of the proceeds (II. xxiv.595). In Iliad xix.181-3, it was Odysseus who insisted on formal delivery of gifts to Achilles in the presence of all. Agamemnon must learn his lesson and refrain from a similar offense in future. Achilles in his remorse for Patroclus' death is in- different to offers of ransom and even to the glory of capturing Troy, though it seems to be in his hands. As soon as Hector is mentioned (xxi.99), the suppliant is slain. As soon as Patroclus is recalled, Achilles' instant renunciation of the capture of Troy is impressive in its emphasis (xxii.385-90). The code of Achilles and, less rigidly, of Hector is only slightly less ferocious than the bushido of the Japanese samurai. Achilles displays loyalty to a friend, not to an overlord, but the claims of vengeance are almost as strongly felt by the Greek hero. Indifference to death, property, or the fate of wife and relatives is strongly marked in the heroes of the Kabuki play, The Forty-seven Ronin.13 A father, for instance, whose son is tortured before his eyes, yields not a jot. After their work of vengeance is done, the ronin commit suicide, since their position is impossible. In Lord Dewa by 13 Produced in 1748 by Takeda Izumo, translated by Jukichi Inouye (4th. ed., Tokyo, Maruzen Co., 1937).</page><page sequence="19">176 L. A. Post [1939 Yamamoto Yuzo 14 the hero in disgrace commits suicide, though he might have saved his life by pleading madness as an excuse for violent action. His honor was involved when his lord gave to another the wife who had been promised to him. This is not very different from Achilles' grievance against Agamemnon, and the plea of madness is a close parallel to Agamemnon's face-saving Ate. The Japanese soldier, like Ajax in Sophocles' play, prefers not to live when he has lost face. The pitiless code of the samurai in Japanese literature is in striking contrast to the gentle precepts of the Buddhist religion, which forbids the taking of life at all. In at least one modern drama a character is made to relinquish one code for the other in a way that is surprisingly similar to the softening of Achilles in Iliad XXIV. This is sufficient evidence that two modes of conduct may be contrasted in one character, and that Homer may have been taking from examples of his own time both the merciless and the pitiful Achilles. I refer to the Japanese drama, Better than Revenge, by Kikuchi Kwan.15 This tells the story of a son's quest for revenge on his father's murderer. When he at last finds the murderer, the latter has become a Buddhist holy man and is devoting his life to the pious work of making a tunnel through rock for a road that is needed to save lives lost on a dangerous path. The avenger first consents to wait a year until the tunnel is finished, then joins in the work to hasten the moment of revenge, but at last, when the tunnel is completed, finds that his religious service has wholly obliterated his allegiance to the code of vengeance, which is but "the shallow business of the human world." Here the contrasted ideals are those of the soldier and of the religious votary. In Iliad XXIV also, the gentler ideal has religious sanction, for Achilles' change of mood is enjoined by the gods. Homer could no doubt have depicted in his epic, as the Japa- 14 Japanese publication in 1921; English translation by Glenn W. Shaw (Tokyo, The Hokuseido Press, 1935). 15 English version by Glenn W. Shaw (Tokyo, Hokuseido, 1935).</page><page sequence="20">Vol. lxx] The Moral Pattern in Homer 177 nese author does, a psychologically motivated change without mention of the gods' command, but he indicates more clearly his approval of pity by adding their sanction. Up to the last book the poet has shown us only the sterner side of Achilles. His tenderness is all for Patroclus. The ideal illustrated is that of a Dorian (or Thessalian?) state, such as we know it in historical times from Sparta or Thebes. We have precisely the same thing in Sophocles, whose leading characters are depicted as unmoved by considerations of pity or fear. His Ajax is a mad Achilles; Philoctetes inspires in Neoptolemus the same fierce ardor that joined Achilles to Patroclus in the Iliad. Homer has used the Dorian, or a similar, military ideal, which the Japanese parallel helps us to understand, and glorified it without reserve. While he was depicting it, he and his audience were entirely under its spell. No logical compulsion restrained hearers from admiring an ideal that they probably did not after all really want to see embodied in their own world.'6 Homer created an epic illusion in the Iliad, but he had then to destroy it and bring his hearers back to reality before the poem ended. He does this by a sort of recantation; he shows us now an Achilles who recognizes the common bonds of social responsibility, who has slain a man but has not slain humanity. We sink from intensity to intimacy of feeling; the mood is that of the Odyssey. Pity is restored to her rightful place when Priam and Achilles weep together. The dramatists of Greece never achieved any such effect, as far as we know; perhaps it was not possible in drama. Though Heracles ex machina reverses Philoctetes' decision to have no commerce with Odysseus and his like, yet Sophocles wisely avoided the attempt to show the two men actually cooperating sympathetically with each other. If he had not done so, the moral compromise involved would have revolted 16 For Greek indifference to logical inconsistency see Ben E.

The god in the machine is a dramatic device for avoiding the moral issue by ignoring instead of solving it. In Homer, the divine behest ordering Achilles to relent and accept ransom for Hector's body, far from ignoring, rather strengthens the moral force of the ending. It can do so be- cause the conflict between Hector and Achilles was not a conflict of good and bad, but a conflict of two noble heroes, who were doomed to fight but not to despise each other. Philoctetes must have continued to despise Odysseus. By divine means Homer was able to make the scene between Priam and Achilles entirely intimate and unofficial. The base Atridae would have blocked any noble dealing, as Achilles indicates (xxiv.655; cf. 686-8). Priam is Hector's surrogate; his devotion to his beloved son is so like Achilles' to Patroclus that the two can blend in one stream. Only the gods made this possible. Although Iliad XXIV is Homer's recantation, it is no re- cantation for Achilles. He neither repents nor regrets what he has done. He can be sorry for Priam without wanting to bring Hector back to life. His code is left intact. He obeys the gods, not the dictates of his own heart, which in its fierce- ness against Hector threatens to make Achilles even forget the command of Zeus (xxiv.560-70). If Achilles had not in- stantly accepted the gods' decree, we should suspect that Homer agreed with his hero against the gods, just as Vergil gives the impression that he is on the side of Dido. As it is, we know that the gods are right. They represent the rational and social element as opposed to personal passion and ideals. Achilles in submitting recognizes that there is a law greater than any individual, no matter how great. Homer's final word exalts the morality that binds all men together. This is the morality that makes civilization possible; it is the morality that pervades the whole of the Odyssey with the sanction of the gods, except for Odysseus' own tale of adven- ture; it is the morality that is represented to some extent by Hector. Hector has fighting moods that are Achillean, when</page><page sequence="22">Vol. lxx] The Moral Pattern in Homer 179 the only thing that counts is to slay the foe and cast his body to the dogs. He has, however, also his social obligations, his loyalty to his city. He fights from a sense of duty for a cause that he disapproves, as many patriots do today. Achilles fights only for glory; Hector fights for glory and for civilization. Homer glorifies Achilles and leaves him unrepentant, yet he does not subscribe to Achilles' code of conduct. By taking advantage of the divine machinery he can reform his hero without softening him. A repentant Achilles would not have been Achilles at all. Homer also confers a new morality on his gods. Thus religion and morals are mutually confirmed and vitalized by the removal of conflict between them. That Achilles did not repent is clear, since he has no regrets or apologies for his treatment of Hector.'7 Since he did not repent, it is evident that he had not violated his own code except through his failure to defend Patroclus. The answer to the question, Had Achilles sinned? may be in doubt. The question, Was he conscious of sin? must certainly be answered in the negative. Achilles' code is clear; it is also clear that Homer does not accept that code as a universal ideal, however inspiring it may be as a romantic ideal for fictional use only. It has been seen that Homer uses the intervention of the gods to redress the balance that has swung against the representa- tive of social order, Hector. The contrast between individual passion and glory, and duty to the community, is not alto- gether clear-cut, not merely because Hector's code as a fighter is not very different from that of Achilles, but also because analysis discloses a serious weakness in Hector's moral position. Troy, to be sure, may be taken as typical of any Greek city attacked by savages or pirates in quest of women and goods, but the moral advantage happens in this case to be with the invaders. The Achaeans are punishing, while the Trojans defend, not merely Troy, but the rape of Helen, and that was different from the capture of women in war, because it offended 17 On these points I agree with Bassett's argument (op. cit., see note 1, pp. 193-207) as against Lang and Bowra.</page><page sequence="23">180 L. A. Post [1939 Zeus Xenios. Logically the Trojans are no better than the suitors of the Odyssey or than Aegisthus. Paris had taken his host's wife and would have been glad to kill him, given a lucky day (II. iii.439f.). Homer might have moralized the story of the Iliad as he did that of Odysseus. I suspect that he did not do so because the moral version was conventional and current, and he felt himself capable of higher things. There are abundant references in the Iliad to the certainty that Troy will fall as punishment for the sin of Paris. The certainty is increased by the Tojan failure to abide by the terms of the truce in Iliad III. Probably Scott was right in thinking that Homer invented Hector to lead the Trojan cause because he would not make a hero of the immoral Paris.'8 It is equally reasonable to suppose that Homer invented Achilles because he did not want to make a hero of Agamemnon or Menelaus. To have done so would have been to underline the moral issue by centering attention on the wrongs of the avenger. Homer chooses protagonists who have no personal stake in the war; thus he can emphasize the pursuit of pure glory and disin- terested devotion to an ideal. Achilles has a special claim to honor because he has no other motive (Ii. i.152-7); Hector also is isolated, since his surviving brothers are ignoble (Il. xxiv.255, 264), and he alone is guided by the star of fair fame as well as duty (Ii. vi.444-6). Homer illustrates the virtue of Hector by making Paris a paragon of vice, as far as he could tolerate vice in his epic at all. Greek literature, like Greek art, is fond of contrasts that spring from analysis. On a certain black-figured Attic vase a painter has shown on one side a chaste embrace of husband and wife, a marital kiss dignified in pose and solemn in its implications. On the other side is seen a satyr in a crude state of erotic excite- ment forcibly appropriating a maiden without ceremony. The two pictures represent dignity and impudence, civilization and savagery, mutual consent and wanton rape.'9 In the 18 John A. Scott, The Unity of Homer (Berkeley, California U. Pr., 1921), 226. 19 See plate 15 in J. D. Beazley, "Attic Black-Figure," in Proc. Brit. Acad. xiv (London, Milford, 1928).</page><page sequence="24">Vol. lxx] The Moral Pattern in Homer 181 Iliad we have Homer's picture of an ideal warrior and his family, matched by the dishonest behavior of Paris and Helen in Iliad III. For Paris daylight dalliance is a consolation for defeat in battle; the other goes to battle in spite of fear or pity, even when pity operates at its strongest in the presence of his wife and child. Helen and Paris have a frustrated love that leads only to shame. They are not a family, but the negation of family life; and they have no child.20 Homer obviously disapproves of them, though he understands them; he invented Hector to be a tragic hero, because for tragedy a good man who makes a mistake is required, not a bad man who deserves an evil fate. The ethical element is obvious in the case of Paris and Helen, though they do not occupy the center of the stage. They are punished, not by death, but by sterility and disgrace. Yet Homer treats them very differently. That he can be merciless in his depiction of inferiors is clear in the case of Thersites, who serves in Iliad II as a villain on whom Odysseus can execute justice, as he does on the suitors in the Odyssey. Paris is too important to be reduced to the level of Thersites, but he comes very close to clownhood in his contest with Menelaus and its sequel. With Helen he is as undignified as Zeus with Hera. Strangely enough, Helen in Homer retains her dignity, though she has lost her virtue; she has moral and emotional depth. It is not her beauty that captivates us, but her regret and her shame. She is not a weeping magdalen, however, since she remains in bondage to her paramour. Nor again is she a romantic heroine of love, because she is ashamed, not proud, of her choice; her glory is not in any resolution that counts the world well lost for love; it is not in any renunciation of shameful love. She is rather depicted as a rebel who suffers from outrageous fortune. Her life of dishonor seems to her worse than death (II. vi.344-51). The gods slay her for their sport; they subdue her body but not her mind. The effect is at once moral and tragic. Homer must have planned it 20 Compare my article, "Dramatic Infants in Greek," Class. Phil. XXXIv (1939). 194f.</page><page sequence="25">182 L. A. Post [1939 with consummate art, the art that is genius and looks obvious in its results because it is not obvious in its means. Divine intervention provides the means. When Aphrodite bids Helen go to Paris against her will (iii.390), the goddess repre- sents libido and is partly psychological, but she is also more. She is a scapegoat upon whom the poet can cast the blame when his story requires him to replace Helen in her old home. He can tell a moral tale of an immoral woman. Euripides was faced by the same problem and solved it in the same way in the extant Hippolytus, where Phaedra and the men are all noble, and only gods are vile. Homer differs from tragedy in the freedom with which he brings a goddess in person into the middle of the action. In other respects Euripides' Aphrodite is perfectly Homeric in purpose. We are now prepared to summarize the moral pattern of the Iliad and to see how it differs from that of the Odyssey. Homer chose in the Iliad to exalt a noble character rather than to illustrate the orthodox theme of crime and punishment. Zeus is, to be sure, resolved on the ultimate destruction of Troy, but when he must choose between Achilles and Aga- memnon, he takes the part of the former, though his choice involves a temporary respite for the doomed Trojans. In this case there is a conflict between noble and base, Zeus being the arbiter who awards victory to the noble. Agamemnon is punished not by death, but by loss of honor, which is always in the Iliad worse than death. He is represented as neither wise nor straightforward. He values power and wealth but snubs the man who is his instrument in acquiring them. He is deluded by Zeus (II. ii.1-6), acting in the interest of Achilles; he is never helped by a divinity except that Hera once (viii.218f.) inspires him in battle. Her hatred for Troy blinds her to any distinction of Greek from Greek. When Aga- memnon is to be base or Achilles noble, nature takes her course without assistance from the gods. The victory of Achilles in Iliad XIX is complete. He generously forgets his quarrel with Agamemnon in order to take vengeance on Hector. The</page><page sequence="26">Vol. lxx] The Moral Pattern in Homer 183 king is still his foolish self, quite willing to accept Achilles' service without compensation. Odysseus, however, will not let him off until he has paid the uttermost farthing (xix.181f.). From this point Achilles takes the lead. Agamemnon acts only on his initiative (xxiii.49, 110f.; 158, 162; 895). Achilles promises a truce for the burial of Hector without consulting Agamemnon. The Atridae cannot be included in any generous arrangement (xxiv.654, 669f., 687f.). Agamemnon is avaricious to the end; only after death does he appreciate the noble fame that Achilles has won (Od. xxiv.93f.). In Agamemnon we have Homer's picture of political and military leadership at its worst. Achilles could show his quality only if he was subjected to pressure, and that pressure must come froni his superior in rank, the leader of the host. It is as necessary for Achilles to maintain his right to a spear- won bride as for Menelaus to take vengeance on the man who took his wife by breach of faith. The hero must win his con- flict with the villain before he can encounter Hector on the field of glory. Hector on his part can have no conflict with his foil Paris, who exists to illustrate a low standard of civic and domestic responsibility. He is a lover of beauty who neglects duty. Instead of fighting he is a connoisseur of choice armor (Ii. vi.321f.); note the jibe that is leveled at Odysseus by. the suitors when as a beggar he examines his bow (Od. xxi.397): v 7ls O?7r p Kat ebrlKX07ros ZrXero -r6wv. Odysseus did not take his bow to Ilium (Od. xxi.38-41), no doubt because it would have lowered his reputation. Paris cares nothing for his reputation. The reason why there can be no conflict between Hector and Paris is clear, for such a conflict would have precluded the meeting of Hector and Achilles. Homer is at great pains to ignore the fact that Hector was the champion of an immoral cause, just as he ignores the moral position of Odysseus during his wanderings. Hector might have proposed the surrender of Helen as An-</page><page sequence="27">184 L. A. Post [1939 tenor did (vii.350-4) or as he himself thought of doing when it was too late (xxii.114), but he says nothing when it would do good. Homer could not let him speak if the Iliad was to go on; hence his persistent and unmotivated silence. Hector never considers this particular moral issue, though he has on occasion words of rebuke for his brother (iii.39-57). There is a contrast but no conflict and no defeat. Paris is simply forgotten when the action becomes tense. Disgrace is suffi- cient punishment. When the villains have been forgotten, the heroes meet. The gods can be on both sides, because there is honor on both sides. Homer prefers to assign the gods with no explanation of their taking sides. He refers but casually to the judgment of Paris (xxiv.27-9). Apollo and Poseidon had the same reason for hating the Trojans, since both had been defrauded of pay by Laomedon (xxi.455-7). Apollo gives no reason for favoring Troy. Since the Greeks were using Poseidon's ocean, it was perhaps necessary that he should be on their side. Still they had the use of the hostile Apollo's servants, the seers, and in the prologue of the Trojan Women Poseidon has been on the Trojan side. Possibly Homer is glorifying a military code that eschewed the bow of Apollo, and the Thracian tactics of Ares, but respected the horse of Poseidon and the shield of Hera-Athena. In any case the code of honor could only be glorified if there were honorable opponents on both sides, and if the feud were pursued without concern for broader social and moral considerations. Feuds are like that in Japanese plays and indeed in all tales of military honor. In the end Homer relieves the tension and brings us back to earth by emphasizing mercy and the ties of kinship. The soldier remembers that he is also a son and a father. The military code in its pure form is nobly romantic, but it can never be human nature's daily food. In real life the samurai and Don Quixote are a nuisance or a joke. In Homer's poem both Hector and Achilles have chosen to die glorious rather than live obscure. Death comes to Hector, not as a punish-</page><page sequence="28">Vol. lxx] The Moral Pattern in Homer 185 ment, but as a reward of virtue. So Achilles prefers fame to power, riches, or long life. He is to die soon after Hector. So high is the standard of the Iliad that death is no punishment for villains but must be reserved as the prerogative of heroes. The tragic moral is plain: when a man chooses to die rather than to desert his ideals, in his death there is nothing ignoble or amiss. This is the thought that gave Plato courage after the death of Dion and made Athens glorious even after Chaeronea (Plato Ep. vii, 334e; Dem. de Cor. 199-205). Socrates found it inspiring (Plato Ap. 28b-d). It is not surprising that Homer, after celebrating the glorious deeds of heroes (KXea 'av#pxv Ii. ix.189) in the Iliad, did not attempt to repeat himself in the later poem. Instead, he chose a contrast of heroes, of heroines, of moral lesson, and of setting. In place of scenes on Olympus we find scenes from folklore; men are competing for a good woman instead of for a bad woman. The idea that formed the nucleus of the Odyssey determined the growth and plan of the poem. What this nucleus was, is indicated by some plain clues in the Odyssey. No woman in the Iliad appreciates glory, certainly not Andromache; she would gladly save her husband from it if she could. Helen knows that she will be a subject for song, but her fame will be evil (Ii. vi.357f.). In the Odyssey we find in Penelope Homer's answer to the question whether a woman can win KfXOs. Penelope is proud of her husband's glory (Od. i.344). Her loyalty to him in his absence goes beyond duty. Odysseus told her before he left Ithaca to marry again when Telemachus had got a beard. It was when he was seventeen years old that the suitors had become insistent. Penelope deceived them for three years by undoing at night her day's work on the winding-sheet of Laertes (ii.88-109). One may assume that the suitors came to Penelope for three successive years and were put off; the fourth time they demonstrated her duplicity and stayed on, resolved not to go until she chose a husband. Since Telemachus was now of age, he might have</page><page sequence="29">186 L. A. Post [1939 given her in marriage, or she might of her own accord have returned to her father, who would then deal in his own way with suitors. She preferred not to quit the house of Odysseus. If he was dead, she lost nothing by staying, for she could marry at leisure. In any case it was Telemachus' property that suffered. Penelope was gaining fame by her loyalty, but Telemachus was footing the bill (ii.125f.) and grew impatient. He could at the worst hold out another year (i.288); he rejects the suggestion that he might forcibly eject his mother (II. 130f.), following the principle laid down in Menander's Epitrepontes (Cairo fr. Z) that a free woman was not obliged to obey orders like a slave, but must be persuaded to consent before she left her husband's house for her father's. Odysseus had not ex- pected Penelope to remain in her house indefinitely. Neither he nor Telemachus expected her to guard their interests (xiii.336; xv.19-23). In fact, her parents as well as Tele- machus were eager for her to marry (xix.158f.), though they could hardly compel her to do so if her son protected her. So Penelope held the fort alone. Her belief in the survival of Odysseus is depicted as an amiable weakness on which every wandering beggar preyed. The suitors suggested that she might be encouraging them in order to gratify her vanity, which was flattered by the number of her suitors (ii.89-92, 125). She replied that she wanted no greater glory than to be wife of Odysseus (xvII.255 = xix.128). When Odysseus as a beggar compliments her on her fame (xix.108), she gives him in answer her idea of fair fame and uses the same argument for seeking it that is found in the Iliad, namely, the shortness of human life (xix.328-34; cf. Ii. xII.322-8). Finally, at the end of the Odyssey (xxiv.194- 202), the poet sums up the theme of woman's glory: (An AWyaOal 4pEves 'o-av A'AAoYL HlrveXoWrep, KOVpp IKapLov US E' AP4VT' 'Obvoiios, avPpos KOVpLt&amp;OV- TC, Ot KX4OS OiV rOT' ,6TEat 7s apErT?s, TeUQovat 69 fWrLXOovlotaL aotbr?v aOaz'arot xap'teo-oav EX'cpovt I17VXoE 0L,</page><page sequence="30">Vol. lxx] The Moral Pattern in Homer 187 oVX Cs Tvvpap'ov KoVpr1 KaKa 1,u77aTo p'ya, KOVpLW7LOV KTECVaOa 7roL' TVY6p% ao T' aoL6757 EaaET 7rO avopwCbrovs, XaXeW7rv 3E TE 4rALV b7raaoTEL O-qXvXTEpp/ao 'yvva~L', Kai 7 K' CvdptrEs P' V. Penelope was in an unfortunate position such that common sense and sentiment were at variance. Her sentimental re- fusal to save the property and forget Odysseus could be justified only by the return of Odysseus, which duly happens in ac- cordance with poetic justice. She strikingly violates the pre- cept that Thucydides (ii.45) attributes to Pericles, that the glorious woman is she whose fame among males, for good or for evil, has the narrowest bounds. Thus Penelope has, like Achilles, made the great decision to sacrifice common sense and aim at glory by following a noble ideal regardless of con- sequences. Homer differs from later writers, not in omitting decisions from his studies of character, but in depicting charac- ters strong enough to decide at once without deliberation. Though Penelope may have deliberated, Homer does not say so. He prefers to depict her, like Achilles, as noble by in- stinct, not by calculation. Except in prayers and except for exhortations to Telemachus to emulate the fair fame won by Orestes, no man gains new glory in the Odyssey. Odysseus is already glorious and does no more than uphold his reputation. It could not be more clearly indicated that the theme of the Odyssey is K?EOs yVVacKOS. Penelope strictly observes the proprieties by never crossing the threshold of her husband's house and by appearing in the men's hall only in the company of two maids and veiled (i.331-5). That a man can write for women of a woman who is universally wooed and persecuted because of her fatal charm, though the propriety of her own conduct is impeccable, is amply proved by historical examples. Consider for instance the Callirhoe of Chariton's romance. She seems to be made to order for female consumption. No doubt many ladies of Homer's acquaintance cared as little as Penelope herself for sad stories of the death of kings, and entertained most gener-</page><page sequence="31">188 L. A. Post [1939 ously those bards who first entertained them with a heroine whose triumph they might share in dreams. Hence we need not succumb to the question of Samuel Butler: 21 "These things being so, is it too much to ask the reader to believe that the poem was not written, as Bentley held, by a man for women, but for both men and women, by one who was herself a woman? " Though he provides in Clytemnestra a foil for Penelope, Homer cannot introduce a conflict. The case is the same as with Andromache and Helen in the Iliad, who do not meet. Thus the conflict against pressure must be won for Penelope by others, namely her husband and son. A plot that con- centrates on the rescue and triumph of the virtuous is re- quired. So in Sophocles, the heroines Antigone and Electra are vindicated by the downfall of their oppressors. Since the defeat of the suitors is to be a punishment, the gods must all be on one side. Since harm comes in the end only to sinners, Homer is free to state the doctrine that mortals are to blame for their own misfortunes, and he puts this doctrine into the mouth of Zeus at the beginning of the Odyssey. It is appro- priate, but it is not peculiar to the Odyssey. What is peculiar is the fame of a good woman and the punishment of bad men by death, not merely by ill fame. Homer could not emphasize in the Iliad the doctrine that misfortune is deserved. The sin of Paris never troubles the thoughts of Achilles; he com- petes only with the virtuous. The loser in battle has not lost the prize of glory, for his fame is secure. Homer will not allow the moral issue to affect our admiration for Hector or our sympathy for Priam. The courteous Achilles reassures Priam with an elaborate assertion that troubles come from Zeus (Ii. xxiv.528-533) and points to the instance of his own father, who is unhappy in his old age by the will of Zeus. Homer with decent impartiality allows Zeus a rebuttal at the beginning of the Odyssey. It would have been very poor art to let Zeus defend himself in the Iliad, for the Iliad glorifies precisely the 21 In The Authoress of the Odyssey2 (New York, Dutton, 1921), 270.</page><page sequence="32">Vol. lxx] The Moral Pattern in Homer 189 man who dies valiantly, not by his own fault, but because he is moved by courage and honor. In the 'ethical' plot the gods may play a consistent and virtuous part. In tragedy proper man is often exalted at the expense of the gods, who act against him for low reasons or with no excuse. Note Aphrodite in the Hippolytus, Hera in Hercules Furens, Athena in the Ajax, Apollo in the Ion. The Greeks were not concerned to vindi- cate the reputation of their gods in such cases. Modern writers who attempt to do so are perversely pious. Critics have normally preferred the Iliad to the Odyssey. Sequels written by the same author are notoriously inferior to the works that they follow. The second part of Don Quixote is a classical example of this. It is probable that Homer, like other artists, once he had completed a masterpiece, concen- trated his creative interest on doing something quite different. It is not unusual for moral lessons to seem more important as one grows older, or for the man who exalted human freedom in his youth to find satisfaction in his old age in a higher concep- tion of the universe as a whole, orderly and moral. In such a universe ends are prescribed, and interest is concentrated on means. The virtues of Odysseus are patience and intelligence. He never has to decide what he wants, for he and his all want to establish a reunited, secure, and prosperous family. Mood and purpose are taken for granted. The Iliad, on the other hand, is far more profound and moving, but a good deal less philosophical. In it the hero sets no limits to his romantic conception of honor and glory. No allowance is made for the possible. When death or necessity in some other inexorable embodiment presents itself, the hero triumphs by despising death. In the Odyssey the gods and the great issues of life have receded into the background. The world has its fabulous fringes, but in the familiar homeland life has become orderly. The tumultuous uncertainty of youth has given way to the quiet confidence of age. The gods can be trusted to do their part to help the pious. There are answers for all questions. The righteous is not forsaken, nor do his seed beg bread forever.</page><page sequence="33">190 L. A. Post [1939 Here again the Odyssey is the complement of the Iliad. The difference in poetic morality is as great as that between Racine's pious Athalie and Esther and his masterpiece PhUdre. I should be sorry to think that Homer like Racine repented of his earlier work. Though he could no longer climb the mountain peaks of song, they must have glowed in his memory as he cultivated the garden of domesticity. He had sung of arms and men with ardor; what remained but to sing of home and woman with charm and piety? In any case he evidently aimed in both poems, different as they are, to present a moral pattern. He would not have refused the tribute of Horace (Epist. i.2.1-4), though he might not have agreed with his interpretation: qui quid sit pulchrum, quid turpe, quid utile, quid non, planius ac melius Chrysippo et Crantore dicit.</page></plain_text>
