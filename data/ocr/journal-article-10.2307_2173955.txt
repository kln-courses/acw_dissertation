<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Decline of Mortality in Ceylon and the Demographic Effects of Malaria Control R. H. GRAY This paper is a reappraisal of the decline of mortality in Ceylon with special reference to the effects of malaria control after 1945. Prior to the Second World War there was an association between the level of mortality and the prevalence of malaria by district in Ceylon. It is shown by the use of a regression model and by geographical analysis that this inter-district differential in mortality can be largely, if not exclusively, ascribed to the inter-district variation in malaria prevalence. Also, the distribution of health services and variations in the levels of nutrition cannot explain the mortality differentials in pre-war Ceylon. There was a rapid decline in mor- tality during the post-war period which was associated with an island-wide malaria control campaign, an extension of the health services, an improvement in nutrition and some economic development. During this period the previous inter-district differentials of mortality were elimi- nated and death rates became homogeneous throughout Ceylon. From a regression model correlating the proportional decline in district mortality with the prevalence of malaria, it is estimated that the malaria control programme contributed approximately 23 per cent or 2 3 per thousand to the decline in the national crude death rate, and malaria control was the major factor responsible for the elimination of the pre-war variation in district mortality levels. Similar effects of malaria control on mortality have been observed in a number of countries. By applying a multiple regression model it is shown that changes in the distribution of health services cannot account for the excessive fall of mortality observed in the more malarious districts, and that improvements in the health services, nutrition, and economic development contributed indi- vidually indeterminate amounts to the overall mortality decline. The conclusions drawn from the present analysis are critically compared with the results of previous studies on the mortality decline in Ceylon. INTRODUCTION The rapid and dramatic decline in mortality experienced by a number of developing countries since the Second World War has been the subject of controversy both in the demographic and medical literature. Ceylon has become a test case for this debate, as the island had relatively reliable vital statistics over the period of interest and sufficient ancillary data are available to permit a detailed analysis of the underlying factors contributing to the mortality decline. The five-year moving averages of the annual crude death rates for Ceylon over the period 1925 to 1960 and the linear trend of mortality between 1925 and 1945 are shown in Figure 1. The death rate declined gradually prior to 1945, with the exception of 1935, which was a year of peak mortality associated with a massive malaria epidemic. However, in the immediate post-war period the crude death rate fell dramatically and there was a marked deviation from the pre-war mortality trend. A similar decline in infant mortality occurred after 1945. Three main theories have been developed to explain the post-war demographic experience of Ceylon. Cullumbine, Abhayaratne and Newman' have argued that the control of malaria was the major factor responsible for the I H.

This has been questioned by Frederiksen2 who maintains that economic development was the predominant influence and Meegama3 who contends that improvements in the health services made the most significant contribution to the fall in death rates. More recently Meade4 has attempted to reconcile these three views and provide a composite theory. Perhaps the main advantage of the Ceylonese data lies in the epidemiology of malaria which provides a 'maximum contrast situation', whereby some areas of the island had highly endemic malaria, but other areas were of lower endemicity or virtually free of the disease. This permits a comparison of the mortality declines in malarious and non-malarious areas and facilitates a quantitative estimate of the demographic impact of malaria control.

The units of observation were the 21 revenue districts of Ceylon. In its simplest form the model could be written Y = a+ bX+? , where Y is the difference between the average crude death rate in 1930-45 and that in 1946-60 per district, and X is the average district spleen rate for the period 1938 to 1941. The constant term 'a' is an estimate of the 'autonomous' decline in mortality due to factors other than malaria and it was assumed that 'a' was equal for all areas. The regression analysis was also applied to the changes in average crude birth rates and the average crude rate of natural increase. In each case the mean change in vital rates for Ceylon as a whole 'F' could be calculated, and an estimate of the average contribution of the malaria component 'bX' to 'F' could be derived. 2 H.

Thus, Newman estimated that malaria control was responsible for approximately 41 6 per cent of the decline in the mean crude death rates after the war. This led to the conclusion that the actual number of deaths directly or indirectly caused by malaria, exceeded by a factor of five the number of deaths ascribed to malaria by death registration.6 Meegama7 has questioned the use of this simple regression model on the grounds that the constant 'autonomous' term 'a' was not equal for all districts, but in fact varied systematically between malarious and non-malarious areas. He argued that, before 1945, the more endemic areas had poorer medical services and nutrition than the less malarious areas, but that in the post-war period there was a massive and disproportionate improvement in health service cover- age and nutrition in the endemic areas. 'Thus, the differences between malarial and non-malarial districts after 1945 lay not only in malaria eradication but also in the fact that the hitherto malarial districts were for the first time provided with a wide range of health and social services which to a great extent were already available to the non-malarious zone before 1946'.8 Meegama suggested that the use of a multiple-regression model incorporating health service variables would have been a more valid approach9 and that Newman's method over-estimated the effects of malaria control by ascribing the differential mortality decline between districts exclu- sively to the variation in malaria prevalence. The present paper is a re-appraisal of the Ceylonese data with special reference to the effects of malaria control on mortality. It is first necessary to examine Meegama's objections to a regres- sion model relating mortality decline to malaria prevalence and then to assess the validity of Newman's additive regression model and his use of absolute change in mortality rates as the dependent variable. THE GEOGRAPHICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY OF MALARIA A description of the characteristics of malaria in Ceylon is a prerequisite for further analysis. The geographical epidemiology of malaria in Ceylon is determined by the breeding habits of the vector mosquito Anopheles culicifacies."0 The larvae of A. culicifacies only breed in still fresh water sites such as sunlit open river pools, stagnant irrigation tanks or ditches, and rain puddles. Breeding is markedly reduced at higher altitudes and does not occur above 3,000 feet. These characteristics of the malaria vector combined with the particular climatic conditions of Ceylon lead to a variable and highly unstable form of malaria transmission. Climatically the island can be conveniently divided into three zones (wet, intermediate and dry) depending on rainfall (Map 1). " The wet zone in the south-west quadrant received over 40 inches of rainfall per year, mainly from the south-west monsoon which blows between May and August. This monsoon seldom fails and the rainfall of the wet zone is further, though un- 6 P. Newman, 'Malaria eradication and its effect on mortality levels.

Because of the heavy rainfall, river flow in the wet zone is usually continuous and the conditions not conducive to the breeding of A. culicifacies larvae; consequently, prior to control, the area tended to have a very low prevalence of malaria. However, when monsoonal failure and drought occurred the rivers stagnated and there was massive larval breeding resulting in epidemics of malaria. Surrounding the wet zone, there is an intermediate climatic zone which receives between 20 and 40 inches of rain per year. This zone is demarcated by the central hill country which acts as a watershed for the two monsoons. Deforestation due to plantation agriculture has reduced the absorptive capacity of the soil and resulted in an irregular river flow characterized by the abrupt flushing and pooling of streams. 12 The stagnant river pools provide breeding sites for A. culicifacies during the two inter-monsoonal dry periods and this results in two corresponding malarial seasons. The intermediate zone as a whole lies in the hypo-endemic or lower meso- endemic ranges of malaria prevalence, though it was particularly vulnerable to severe epidemics of malaria during drought years. The only exception to this pattern occurs in the higher-altitude hill country where larval breeding was inhibited regardless of rainfall. Agriculture in the wet and intermediate zones consisted of substantial export cash crops such as tea, rubber and copra and there was cultivation of largely non-irrigated paddy rice for local consumption. The dry zone is a large, sparsely populated area in the northern half of the island and the south-eastern quadrant. This zone receives less than 20 inches of rainfall annually from the weak and unreliable north-west monsoon. Agriculture is dependent on tank storage irrigation and due to the neglect of the ancient irrigation canals there are large bodies of stagnant water available for intensive perennial larval breeding. As a consequence, the dry zone had hyper-endemic 12 T. W. Tyssul Jones, loc. cit., in footnote 11 pp. 142-148.</page><page sequence="5">DECLINE OF MORTALITY IN CEYLON 209 malaria, though transmission was exacerbated during the rainy season when prolific breeding occurred in rain puddles. There were two exceptions to this pattern. One was Badulla district in the eastern hill country where the population was concentrated at higher altitudes, which were relatively free of malaria. The other exception was Jafna district in the north where the bulk of the population lived on the Jafna peninsula. Here the Ceylonese Tamils restored the ancient irrigation channels, allowing year-round water flow and so avoiding the malarial hazards of stagnant water storage. Dry zone agriculture largely consisted of irrigated paddy, though in some areas primitive shifting cultivation was practised. With the exception of Badulla district, there was virtually no cash crop agriculture in this zone, though fishing provided a source of income and dietary supplement in coastal areas. For the analysis of the mortality associated with malaria it is necessary to have an index of malaria prevalence per district. The spleen rate, the percentage of the sample population with clinical splenomegaly, is the most suitable statistic available. National surveys were carried out before and after the war, and the average district spleen rates for the years 1938-41 provide the best index of malaria prevalence prior to the malaria control campaign.'3 The parasite rate, expressed as the percentage of sample blood films examined which are positive for malaria parasites, is available from national surveys both before and after the war. The Ceylonese parasite rates are less reliable than the spleen rates as an index of malaria preva- lence due to the smaller sample sizes of the parasite surveys and the intra-subject variability of the parasitaemia. However, the decline in the parasite rate during and after the malaria control campaign is the best available index of the decrease in malaria transmission over time.14 In order to undertake certain comparisons it is necessary to classify districts into broad zones of malaria prevalence. The categories used here are adapted from Rajendram and Jayewickreme who based their classification on the ranking of district spleen rates for the year 1939.'" The districts fall into three zones of malaria prevalence loosely termed non-endemic, moderate and endemic zones. Additional criteria have been considered here; these are the average spleen rates and the average parasite rates for the years 1938-41; Gabladon's index of endemicity;'6 the climatic zones, the average crude death rates and the average infant mortality rates 1936-45. These indices for each district and the means for the three zones are given in Table 1. The four indices of malaria prevalence show a clear distinction between the non-endemic and endemic 13 The spleen rate is a valid index of malaria prevalence and MacDonald has stated that 'the prevalence of splenic enlargement indicates the intensity of infection to which a community is subject'. G. MacDonald, The Epidemiology and Control of Malaria, Oxford University Press (1957), p. 80. The Ceylonese spleen surveys were of adequate size, but the sampling frame was restricted. However, any biases arising from these restrictions would tend to dilute rather than exaggerate the associations searched for in this study. See R. H. Gray, 'The Contribution of Malaria Control to the Mortality Transition in the Developing World: A Case Study of Ceylon', Thesis for the M.Sc. in Medical Demography, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (1971), pp. 26-28. The use of a single average district spleen rate cannot fully describe the intra-district diversity in the prevalence of malaria. However, the rates used are weighted averages and with the exception of the two anomalous districts, Jafna and Badulla, most areas were relatively homogeneous in the distribution of malaria. A more detailed discussion of these problems is contained in S. Rajendram and S. H. Jayewickreme, loc. cit. in footnote 10, pp. 6-9; P. Newman, 1965, op. cit. in footnote 1, pp. 32-37; and R. H. Gray, op. cit. The spleen rates before 1938 were distorted due to the effects of the massive 1935 malaria epidemic and between 1941 to 1945 comprehensive national spleen sur- veys were discontinued due to the intervention of the Second World War. See T. Visvalingam, loc. cit in footnote 10, p. 56. 14 The parasite rates are given in T. Visvalingam, loc. cit, Table IX, p. 92, and S. Rajendram and S. H. Jaye- wickreme, loc. cit. in footnote 10, Table II, p. 52. For a description of the surveys see T. Visvalingam, loc. cit. pp. 56-58. There are limitations to the use of the parasite rate as a guide to the short-term progress of control measures, see G. MacDonald, op. cit. in footnote 13, p. 163. However, the infant parasite rate, which is a more suitable statistic, is not available before 1951 when it was found to be effectively zero, see T. Visvalingam, loc. cit., Table X p. 93. 15 S. Rajendram and S. H. Jayewickreme, loc. cit., p. 8. 16 Gabladon's index of endemicity is the lowest spleen rate over five years divided by five; an index of three or less is considered to indicate a low level of malaria endemicity.

Also, the non-endemic districts, with the exception of Jafna, are all within the wet or intermediate climatic zones, whereas the endemic districts lie predominantly, and in most cases exclusively, within the dry zone. Similarly, the crude death rates and infant mortality rates of the endemic districts exceed those of the non-endemic districts. The three moderate-zone districts tend to occupy an intermediate position, resembling the endemic districts in some characteristics but not in others.'7 The issue central to this classification is that there is a clear TABLE 1.

GRAY Anuradhapura district in November 1945. By September 1946, the endemic zone had been sufficiently covered to prevent the seasonal rise in malaria and by 1947 the nationwide scheme was fully operative.'8 It is difficult to give a precise description of the decline in malaria trans- mission over the control period as the evaluation techniques were rudimentary by present standards. The parasite rate is the best indicator of the progress of control measures and as shown in Figure 2 the average district parasite rates fell below five percent of the pre-war levels by early 1949. The variation in parasite rates between districts was also markedly reduced by that year. Entomological evidence shows that by late 1948 the density of A. culicifacies had reached sub- critical levels at which active transmission of malaria could not occur.19 The declines in malaria morbidity and mortality are shown in Table 2. Malaria morbidity fell substantially after 1946, though the actual decline in morbidity was probably more marked than that indicated by the rates in Table 2 as there was a progressive increase in the proportion TABLE 2.

The diagnostic artifact is shown by the fall in the percentage of clinically diagnosed cases of malaria which were confirmed by parasitological examination (Table 2) and it suggests that the morbidity rates were progressively inflated due to the persistence of old diag- nostic habits, despite the decline in true cases of malaria. A similar diagnostic artifact probably influenced the decline in malaria mortality rates as the registration of deaths due to malaria was also subject to considerable error.20 Bearing these points in mind, the actual decrease in malaria 18 For a detailed description of the campaign see S.

Jayewickreme, loc. cit. in footnote 10, p. 47, and Tables XVI to XX. Similar evidence for the interruption of transmission when the density of A. culicifacies falls below critical levels; a condition of 'anophelism without malaria', is given in P. F. Russell and J. R. Rao, 'A study of the density of Anopheles culicifacies in relation to malaria endemicity', American Journal of Tropical Medicine, 22 (1942), pp. 535-558, and G. MacDonald, op. cit, in footnote 13, p. 18. 20 Deaths directly due to malaria are mainly the result of infections by Plasmodium falciparum, though P. vivax infections can be fatal in children and P. malariae can produce a lethal nephrosis. See G. W. Hunter, F. W. Frye and J. C. Swartzwelder, A Manual of Tropical Medicine, W. B. Saunders (1966), pp. 347-350. The prevalence of of the three species of malaria parasites varied from year to year; the predominant species was generally P. vivax, though P. falciparum was always present in significant numbers. See T. Visvalingam, loc. cit. in footnote 10, pp. 56-57 and the Administration Reports of the Director of Medical and Sanitary Services (1947), pp. 33 and (1950), p. 117. There was a substantial underregistration of deaths due to malaria as it was common practice for the village registrars to refer to deaths from all febrile illnesses by the vernacular names of 'una' or 'kaichkal' and these terms were classified as 'pyrexia of unknown origin' by the Registrar General. This would tend to underestimate</page><page sequence="9">DECLINE OF MORTALITY IN CEYLON 213 deaths was probably more abrupt than indicated in Table 2. In summary, the evidence implies that malaria control was firmly established by early 1949 and that the mortality and morbidity from the disease fell markedly between 1946 and 1949. THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MORTALITY AND MALARIA PREVALENCE Newman2' has shown that there was a strong positive correlation between the average district crude death rates for the years 1930 to 1945 and the average district spleen rates (1938-41). This relationship has been re-examined for the period 1936 to 1945 so as to avoid the distorting effects on mortality of the disastrous malaria epidemic of 1935. The regression of the mean crude death rate per district (1936-45) as the dependent variable, and the average spleen rates (1938-41) as the independent variable, yielded the equation: M = 15-9 + 0 2704X, r = 0-9112. The correlation of average district crude death rates (1936-45) with the average district parasite rates (1938-41) was: M = 1564+1.4727X, r = 0-7936. Similar significant associations exist between the mean district age-specific death rates (1936-45) and the spleen rates.22 Also, the mean cause-specific mortality rates for malaria and pyrexia of unknown origin combined, for the years 1936 to 1945, were significantly correlated with the district spleen rates (r = 0 5549 for 19 degrees of freedom). Therefore, there is presumptive evidence that before 1945 the mortality contrasts between districts, and thus zones of malaria endemicity, were determined by the prevalence of malaria. TABLE 3. The trend in crude death rates between 1925 and 1945, by zones of malaria prevalence Zone of Trend line equations Malaria prevalence 1925-45 Non-endemic zone Y = 23-35-0259X Moderate zone Y = 27-18-0 490X Endemic zone Y = 35 05-0103X Equation Y = a+ b.X; where Y is the crude death rate per annum between 1925 and 1945, a is the crude death rate in 1925, and X is years. (X = 0 in 1925.) The crude death rates are means of the district crude death rates for each zone of malaria prevalence. Table 3 shows the mean linear trends in crude death rates over the period 1925 to 1945 by zones of malaria endemicity. The non-endemic districts exhibited relatively low average crude death rates in 1925 and, as indicated by the slope, there was only a modest decline in mortality malaria mortality and to exaggerate the deaths from 'pyrexia of unknown origin'. Thus, it was common practice in the Annual Reports to present the two causes of death together 'as they afford a better index of the prevalence of malaria'. See Reports of the Registrar General of Ceylon (1938), p. 22. It is also probable that some malaria deaths amongst children were allocated to the category of deaths due to 'convulsions under five', as convulsions due to cerebral malaria or fever are a common mode of death in childhood malaria. See G. W. Hunter, F. W. Frye and J. C. Swartzwelder, op. cit., pp. 349-350. However, chronic malaria is also a debilitating disease and may indirectly contribute to mortality from other unrelated conditions by undermining the individual's resistance. Thus, deaths ascribed to malaria alone may not reflect the total number of deaths indirectly attributable to malaria acting in conjunction with other pathology. 21 P. Newman, op. cit. (1965), p. 43 and loc. cit. (1970), p. 138, both in footnote 1. 22 Ibid. (1965), p. 234 and (1970), pp. 142-143. Also R. H. Gray, op. cit., p. 45, in footnote 13.</page><page sequence="10">214 R. H. GRAY before 1945. The moderate-zone districts showed higher crude death rates at the beginning of the period but there was a considerable fall in mortality over the four decades. However, the endemic zone areas experienced high death rates in 1925 and there was no significant decline in mortality before 1945. Thus, the presence of endemic malaria appears to have inhibited the pre-war decline of mortality in the endemic areas and maintained the death rates at high levels. Furthermore, the correlation between district crude death rates and the average district spleen rates breaks down after the implementation of malaria control (Table 4) and mortality becomes homogeneous throughout Ceylon.23 So the elimination of malaria is associated with the disappearance of the pre-war inter-district contrasts in mortality as well as the rapid post-war decline in national mortality rates (Figure 1).24 This point will be pursued further, but first certain disturbing variables which may bias the malaria/mortality association must be examined. HEALTH SERVICES AND MORTALITY Meegama has argued that the pre-war association between the prevalence of malaria and the contrasts in mortality is spurious, and that the maldistribution of medical services can account for the differences in district crude death rates prior to 1945. Similarly, he maintains that the post- TABLE 4.

The evidence for these assertions is largely derived from the data contained in the table showing the 'siting of hospitals before 1943 and new construction between 1943 and 1948.'25 This table is somewhat misleading as it fails to relate the number of hospitals to the population served.26 Also, it does not consider the nature of the facilities constructed during the period 1943 to 1948.27 The other quantitative evidence that Meegama presents for the importance of medical services vis-a-vis malaria control, mainly depends on the timing of mortality declines related to the introduction of new medical services. It is difficult to assess with any precision when a new service achieved effective coverage and as the mortality rates are often derived from small populations, they are liable to the distorting 23 The average of the district crude death rates for the period (1936-45) was 24-52 per thousand with a standard deviation of 6 29. The average of the district crude death rates for the period (1946-60) was 11-65 per thousand and the standard deviation was 1 29. Thus the inter-district variation of mortality was reduced in the post-war period and death rates became relatively uniform throughout Ceylon. 24 Also see P. Newman, loc. cit. (1970), in footnote 1, pp. 136-141. 25 S. A. Meegama, loc. cit. in footnote 3, p. 212, Table 2. 26 Meegama gives no definition of the 'endemic zone', see P. Newman, loc. cit. in footnote 6, p. 287. 27 In 1944, the government adopted the policy of phasing out central dispensaries and replacing them by rural hospitals. See Administration Reports of the Director of Medical and Sanitary Services (1944), p. 11 and (1945), p. 19. This programme was not one of new construction per se, rather it entailed the upgrading of pre-existing rural health facilities and, as will be shown later, the more malarious areas had a better rural health service network. Thus, the more malarious areas benefited considerably from the rural hospital programme, not because they were deficient in peripheral health services, but because previously they had a better central dispensary coverage.</page><page sequence="11">DECLINE OF MORTALITY IN CEYLON 215 effects of random fluctuations.28 However, even with these limitations the data can only show that health services may effect mortality, but this is not the point at issue. The important point is whether the distribution of health services acts as a disturbing variable in the correlation of mortality with malaria prevalence. In order to eliminate this possibility, the geographical distribu- tion of the Ceylonese medical services has been analysed both before and after the war. The health services in Ceylon can be divided into central and peripheral facilities. The central services consisted of provincial hospitals with 500 to 700 beds and district hospitals with 50 to 200 beds. In the post-war period there was an attempt to decentralize the hospital system by the wide-scale construction of cottage hospitals with an average of 20 beds per unit.29 The peripheral services consisted of central dispensaries which were staffed by trained apothecaries and had facilities for in-patient care. These were supplemented by branch dispensaries and visiting stations which provided out-patient care and used lower-grade paramedical staff.30 After 1944, rural hospitals were introduced to replace central dispensaries. In 1939, the government adopted a policy of establishing maternity homes attached to each central dispensary, but due to financial restrictions this policy was not fully implemented until after the war. There were other specialized government institutions such as tuberculosis sanatoria and some medical services were provided by missions and private enterprise. The data on these latter facilities are not sufficiently detailed to permit an analysis of their distribution. The distribution of medical services before the Second World War can best be assessed for the year 1938, as this is the last pre-war year in which a map showing medical facilities is avail- able. Data on central services in the form of the number of hospitals, beds and admissions per district can be obtained from the tables contained in the Administration Reports of the Director of Medical and Sanitary Services for the year 1938, and peripheral services can be calculated from map counts.3' The data were analysed in two ways; firstly using the distribution of services per head by zones of malaria prevalence, and secondly by correlating the medical services per head, per district, with the average crude death rates (1936 to 1945) per district. In Table 5 the distribution of medical services in 1938 is shown by zones of malaria preva- lence. It would appear that the endemic and moderate zones had a lower population per hospital than the non-endemic zone. However, this is partly an artifact as hospitals in the non-endemic zone tended to be larger institutions and the population per hospital bed is comparable in all three zones.32 The hospital admissions per thousand population are a crude index of hospital utilization; essentially they are a composite figure depending upon morbidity rates, accessibility of hospitals, bed turnover and the motivation of the populace to use the services. In the endemic and moderate zones admission rates per thousand population were marginally higher than in the non-endemic zone and this is in agreement with the higher morbidity experienced in the more malarious areas. The peripheral medical service coverage in the more malarious zones is markedly superior to that of the non-endemic zone and this is consistent with the scattered rural populations in the more malarious areas. This analysis of the distribution of health services fails to substantiate 28 Meegama also presents qualitative evidence in the form of statements by administrators and doctors. How- ever, it is difficult to assess the value of this material due to the potential bias of the original sources, the selectivity of the quotations and the problems of using qualitative data when examining essentially quantitative issues.

The hospital statistics are contained in the same report, Table I, Hospital Returns, p. 113. 32 A proportion of the hospital beds available in the non-endemic and moderate zones were in specialized institu- tions such as asylums and tuberculosis hospitals. Thus, the population actually served per general medical and surgical beds iri these two zones is somewhat greater than the figures in Table 5 suggests and there is probably no significant disparity in the population per general hospital bed between the three zones of malaria prevalence.</page><page sequence="12">2I6 R. H. GRAY Meegama's assertion that medical services were concentrated in the non-malarious areas in the pre-war period. The correlation of the mean district crude death rates (1936 to 1945) with the health service indices is given in Table 6. There is a negative correlation between the crude death rates and the population per hospital, the population per bed and the population served per central dispensary. There is a weak and statistically insignificant positive association between mortality and admis- sions per thousand population.

This casts further doubt upon the validity of Meegama's hypothesis and implies that the beneficial effects of health services may have been overwhelmed by the detrimental effects of endemic malaria. There is other evidence to suggest that the efficacy of health services may be limited by the presence of severe malaria. Before the war there were eleven areas where health units were established to provide intensive maternal and child welfare services; nine areas were in the non- endemic zone and two in the endemic zone.33 As is shown in Table 7, the average infant and 3 Administration Report of the Director of Medical and Sanitary Services (1938), p. 75 and (1939), p. 22.</page><page sequence="13">DECLINE OF MORTALITY IN CEYLON 2I7 maternal mortality rates of the health unit areas in the endemic zone were higher than those of the health unit areas of the non-endemic zone and exceeded the rates for Ceylon as a whole. Thus, despite the concentrated medical services, mortality among mothers and children remained excessive in the malarious areas. TABLE 7.

Also, the newly constructed maternity homes were concentrated in the endemic areas. It is difficult to quantify the improvement in medical services over the decade 1938 to 1948 because of the changes in the tabulation of hospital statistics. However, there was generally an improved coverage in the post-war period which, as will be shown later, was fairly TABLE 9.

With the exception of the innovations in maternity homes, there is no evidence for an unbalanced improvement in medical services as suggested by Meegama.36 Table 9 gives an indication of the expansion of medical services between 1938 and 1948. This was associated with a substantial increase in the health budget, which was further supplemented by foreign aid. The improvement was not merely quantitative; there was also a change in the quality of the service. This is illustrated by the numerical increase in medical officers coupled with the fall in the number of apothecaries and the growth of rural TABLE 10.

Although it is difficult to quantify the impact of these new drugs some indication of their effect can be gained from the reduction in hospital case fatality rates shown in Table 10. In summary, this quantitative analysis of health services shows that there was no overt maldistribution of services before 1945 which could explain the inter-district contrasts in mor- tality. Although the improvements in medical services after 1945 undoubtedly contributed to the overall fall in death rates, the changes in the health service cannot account for the elimination of the pre-war mortality contrasts and the excessive mortality declines in the more malarious areas.

NUTRITION AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Diet can have a profound influence on mortality and morbidity, both by the direct effects of frank malnutrition and the synergistic interaction between inadequate nutrition and infection.37 Nichols and Nimalasuriya conducted quantitative dietary surveys in rural communities in 1940 and 1941.38 The villages, chosen so as to be 'representative of the conditions prevailing in each district' can be allocated to zones of malaria prevalence and of the 13 villages surveyed, five were in the non- endemic zone, one in the moderate zone and seven in the endemic zone.39 This permits a com- parison of rural diets by zones of malaria prevalence in order to examine Meegama's assertion that nutrition in the malarious areas was poorer than in the less malarious areas before 1945.4 Table 11 shows the average values of the dietary constituents with the villages grouped into the three malarial zones. The daily consumption of protein, carbohydrate, calories and minerals was greater in the endemic zone than in the non-endemic and moderate-zone villages. On the other hand, the cash value of the diet in the endemic zone was smaller than in the other two areas, as the villagers in the more malarious zones consumed a higher proportion of locally grown 'country rice' relatively to the more expensive imported rice. These dietary differences are reflected in the 3' For an account of the relationship between nutrition and infectious disease see N. S. Scrimshaw, C. E. Taylor and J. E.

The generally superior nutritional status of the rural population in the malarious areas is consistent with the fact that these villagers were mainly subsistence paddy cultivators and fishermen, whereas the villagers from the other two zones were predominantly estate labourers dependent on cash wages for the purchase of more expensive imported foodstuffs.4' Although Nichols and Nimalasuriya's survey has many limitations in methodology and coverage, the results strongly suggest that at least in rural areas the diet of the non-endemic zone population was inferior to that of the endemic zone. However, it is possible that nutrition amongst urban dwellers in the non-malarious areas may have been superior to that of the rural population. The data on urban/rural diets are fragmentary, but some information can be gleaned from the anthropometric survey of adolescents and adults conducted by Cullumbine in 1949.42 Subjects from the predominantly non-endemic wet zone were taller, heavier and generally of larger stature than the subjects from Colombo or the predominantly endemic dry zone.43 However, the height and weight of the dry zone population equalled that of Colombo and the weight/height ratio was significantly greater than in Colombo. Thus, nutrition in Colombo does not appear to have been superior to rural nutrition in the dry zone and it is noteworthy that mortality in Colombo was significantly lower than mortality in any of the dry zone districts (see Table 1). The nutritional implications of this anthropometric survey in part conflict with the results of Nichols and Nimalasuriya's dietary studies. However, on balance it would seem that disparities in diet could not account for the mortality differences between zone of malaria prevalence before 1945.44 There was a considerable improvement in nutrition after the war,45 but there is no evidence to suggest that this in any way favoured the malarious areas. In fact, a dietary survey in 1949 showed that diets in the wet zone were somewhat better than those in the dry zone,46 so nutritional changes cannot account for the rapid and dramatic decline of mortality in the predominantly malarious dry zone localities. Also, mortality rates became homogeneous throughout Ceylon despite these nutritional differences observed in 1949, so nutrition alone could not have been an important factor in the pre-war mortality differentials between districts. In summary, there is no evidence to suggest that dietary factors act as a disturbing variable in the malaria/mortality correlation. 41 The chief occupation of the villagers is given in L. Nichols and A. Nimalasuriya, loc. cit. in footnote 38, p. 63. The rice yield per acre from paddy was high in many of the more malarious areas. See H. Cullumbine, 'The mor- tality zones of Ceylon', Ceylon Journal of Medical Science, 7, 3 and 4 (December 1950), p. 158, Table 42 and p. 157, map 4. 42 H. Cullumbine, 'The influence of environment on certain anthropomorphic characters', Ceylon Journal of Medical Science (D), 6, 3 (1949), pp. 164-170. The survey was conducted on 7,000 subjects of both sexes aged ten years and over. Though the sample consists of several cohorts and a number of racial groups, it should in part reflect nutritional conditions prevailing before 1945. It is difficult to exclude the influence of racial differences from the results, but Cullumbine states that an analysis of variance has shown that 'the variance due to race has not been significant whereas that due to environment has', ibid., p. 173. 43 H. Cullumbine, loc. cit. in footnote 42, p. 171, Table 3. As indicated in Table 1 the climatic zones do not correspond precisely to the zones of malaria prevalence, but the discrepancies are not large and should not bias the present comparisons. However, no indication is given of the age/sex composition of the samples from the three zones and the results may be biased by the inadequate matching of these parameters. 4 These findings are at variance with the conclusions reached by Meegama, loc. cit. in footnote 3, p. 211 which were based upon qualitative evidence. 4 The improvement in nutrition can be adduced from the increases in the height and weight of school children surveyed in 1935, 1945 and 1950. See the Administration Reports of the Director of Medical and Sanitary Services (1949), p. 53 and (1950), p. 60. Also, some villages which had repeated dietary surveys showed an improvement in diet over time, see N. K. Sarkar, The Demography of Ceylon, Government Press, Ceylon (1957), p. 163, and R. H. Gray op. cit. in footnote 13, p. 81. There was also an increase in the quantities of food imported into Ceylon after the war, see H. Fredericksen, loc. cit. in footnote 2, pp. 659-661; H. Frederiksen, op. cit. (1962), pp. 382-384; and S. A. Meegama, loc. cit. in footnote 3, pp. 213-214. However, Newman, loc. cit. in footnote 1, p. 153, has shown that certain imported foodstuffs, especially meat, could only have a minimal influence on indigenous Ceylonese diets. 46 H. Cullumbine, S.

Sarkar has shown that the buoyant post-war economic situation was largely due to the rise in world prices for plantation products and that there was actually a deterioration in peasant land holdings.49 There was also a marked rise in unemployment between 1946 end 1949 in all sectors of the economy bar the estate sector.50 Thus, the development of the economy may not have been associated with a rise in general living standards due to the selective nature of the economic improvements and a maldistribution of wealth. On the other hand, the improved financial position after the war is reflected in the increased health expenditure during the period, and it is possible that the main contribution of economic progress to the decline in mortality was mediated via the expansion in health services. Certainly, there is no evidence that economic considerations interfere with the use of a regression model relating the fall in mortality to the control of malaria.5' A REGRESSION MODEL TO RELATE THE DECLINE IN MORTALITY TO THE PREVALENCE OF MALARIA From the foregoing discussion it is clear that there are no significant disturbing variables which would lead to a bias in the application of a regression model to relate the decline in mortality to the prevalence of malaria. However, Newman's use of the absolute decline in the mean crude death rate as the dependent variable of such a model52 presents a number of difficulties. Firstly, Newman's estimate that malaria control was responsible for 41-6 per cent of the decline in the mean crude death rates between 1930-45 and 1946-60 seems excessive in view of the fact that only 25 per cent of the population resided in areas of moderate or highly endemic malaria.53 Also, the estimate 'that the total deaths due to malaria were of the order of five times the number of deaths actually ascribed to malaria'54 is improbable even given the misdiagnosis and mis- classification of malaria deaths and the possible role of malaria as a debilitating disease con- tributing to mortality from other causes. Newman's model assumes that there is a linear relationship between the decline in mortality and the prevalence of malaria regardless of the level of malaria, although there is no a priori reason why this should be the case. In fact, the risk of fatal superinfection especially with the highly lethal parasite P. falciparum, is increased in areas of hyper- and holo-endemic malaria despite the counterbalancing effects of immunity.55 Under the unstable malaria conditions of Ceylon this could lead to a higher case fatality rate in the highly endemic areas. Consequently, " H. Frederiksen, loc. cit.

Frederiksen, op. cit. (1962), pp. 380-383 and loc. cit. in footnote 2, pp. 865-866. Both these assertions have been criticized on points of detail and methodology. See P. Newman, loc. cit.

GRAY malaria control could be expected to produce disproportionately greater falls of mortality in the more malarious areas, and such a situation would tend to produce a non-linear regression. As there are only 21 districts, the data are not sufficient to demonstrate a non-linear relationship, especially at the higher levels of malaria prevalence where there are only few observations. However, if there were a non-linear relationship the use of a simple additive model would tend to over-estimate the mortality decline due to malaria control, whereas a model using the propor- tional change in crude death rates would compensate for any tendency towards non-linearity.56 Another underlying assumption of Newman's model is that the mortality decline is not related to the initial pre-war level of mortality, except via the effects of malaria control and the previous prevalence of malaria. This is not valid, as an area with initially high mortality has a greater potential range of mortality decline than an area of initially low mortality. For example, if a hypothetical district 'A' had a pre-malaria control death rate of 30 and another district 'B' had a pre-malaria control death rate of 15, it would not be unreasonable for mortality to decline by 15 points in district 'A, but such a decline would be impossible in district 'B'. A model using the relative change in crude death rates as the dependent variable would overcome this problem, as proportional change is not limited by the initial level of mortality. In the example given above, if the crude death rate in district 'A' declined by 15 points from 30 to 15 per thousand and the crude death rate in district 'B' declined by 7 5 points from 15 to 7 5 per thousand, such a change would be equal on a proportional scale, but area 'A' would have twice the mortality decline of area 'B' using an absolute scale. Thus, the analysis of mortality decline using the absolute change in crude death rates is biased towards an exaggeration of the fall of mortality in those areas with initially high death rates compared to those with initially low death rates. As the more malarious areas had higher pre-control death rates, Newman's model would tend to over-estimate the effects of malaria control on mortality. There is also an epidemiological rationale for the use of a model incorporating the propor- tional decline in mortality. MacDonald and Glockel57 have shown that during malaria control or eradication, the prevalence of malaria as measured by the parasite rate declines logarithmically over time, and as indicated in Figure 2 the Ceylonese experience conformed to this predicted pattern. If the prevalence of malaria declines exponentially one would expect that the deaths due to malaria would behave in a similar fashion. Thus, a model using the proportional or logarithmic decrease in mortality would be a more realistic representation of the epidemiological situation. In brief, there are statistical, mathematical and epidemiological considerations which suggest that Newman's additive model over-estimates the contribution of malaria control to the decline in mortality.58 Using a logarithmic transformation, the regression of the logarithmic change in mean crude death rates, i.e. the difference between the logarithms of the crude death rates in 1936-45 and those in 1946-60 as the dependent variable 'Y' on the average spleen rate (1938-41) per district 'X' gave the equation: Y = 0 2068+0 0039X, r = 0 9055 (t = 9-1916 on 19 degrees of freedom, P&lt;0 001). The antilogarithm of the logarithm of mean decline in the crude death rate, antilog ' 5' = 2 05 and the antilogarithm of the logarithm of mean malaria component, antilog 'bX' = 0A44. Thus, malaria control contributed approximately 21 per cent (0A44/2 05) to the average decline in crude death rates for Ceylon as a whole. 56 For a discussion of this issue see R. H. Gray, op. cit. in footnote 13, pp. 95-98. A model using the propor- tional change in crude death rates as the dependent variable gives a more satisfactory fit than a model using the absolute change in crude death rates. See footnote 61. 5 G. MacDonald and G. W. Glockel, 'The malaria parasite rate and the interruption of transmission', Bulletin of the World Health Organisation (1964), 31, pp. 365-377. 58 Frederiksen also examines the relative change in mortality, but not in the context of a regression model.

If 'Y' is the percentage decrease in average crude death rates per district, i.e. M36-45-M46-60x10 Y= x ~~~~100 M36-45 the equation of the line is: Y = 30 4+0 422X, r = 0 9059. (t = 9.247 on 19 degrees of freedom, P&lt;0 001.) The mean percentage fall in the crude death rate for Ceylon as a whole, '7Y' equals 50 1 per cent and the average malaria component 'br' equals 11 7 per cent. Therefore, it is estimated that malaria contributed approximately 23 4 per cent (11 7/50-1) to the total decline in the crude death rate. Translating this proportional contribution of malaria control into the actual effect on the crude death rate, it is estimated that malaria control was responsible for a decline of approxi- mately 2 3 per thousand in the post-war average crude death rate.59 This estimate of the impact of malaria control on mortality is comparable to that derived from the use of a logarithmic transformation and is approximately half the effect estimated by Newman. 95 per cent confidence intervals have been calculated for both Newman's regression model using the absolute change in crude death rate, and for the present proportional model using the percentage change in crude death rate as the dependent variable.60 At the higher levels of malaria prevalence, especially in districts with spleen rates greater than 25 per cent, the proportional model gave a better fit as measured by the number of observations falling outside the confidence intervals.6' In order to relate the mortality decline more precisely to the period of malaria control, the change in average district crude death rates between 1936-45 and 1946-50 was correlated with the decline in the average district spleen rates between 1938-41 and 1946-50. Using the propor- tional decline in crude death rates as the dependent variable, the equation of the line is: Y-22-345+0.6553X. r = 08353. The average percentage decline in crude death rate '?F' equals 34 4 per cent and the malaria component 'BX' equals 12 055 per cent. Therefore, it is estimated that malaria control was responsible for approximately one-third of the decline in mortality over the immediate control period which implies that malaria control reduced the average crude death rate by around 2 6 per thousand over this short space of time. A similar analysis using the absolute decline in death rates as the dependent variable would arrive at the conclusion that malaria control contributed over 70 per cent to the decline in average mortality between 1936-45 and 1946-50, or a fall in the crude death rate of 5 35 per thousand.62 This latter estimate seems most excessive in view of the previous considerations and it illustrates the fact that the additive model tends to over- estimate the effects of malaria control, especially over the short term during which the control campaign was implemented. II The 95 per cent confidence intervals for the estimate of the contribution of malaria control to the decline in the national crude death rate are between 22-4 per cent and 24-5 per cent. Stated in numerical terms, it is estimated that malaria control produced a fall in the national crude death rate of between 2-25 and 2-47 per thousand. 60 The 95 per cent confidence intervals for the two regression models were calculated using the methods described by P. Armitage, in Statistical Methods in Medical Research, Oxford, Blackwell Scientific Publications (1971), pp. 163-165. Scatter diagrams showing the regression lines and confidence intervals are shown in R. H. Gray, op. cit. in footnote 13, Figs. 7 and 8. 61 There are ten districts with average spleen rates equal to or greater than 25 per cent. Using Newman's additive model five out of ten observations fell outside the 95 per cent confidence limits and using the proportional model only two out of ten observations lie outside the 95 per cent confidence limits. 62 Using the absolute decline in average crude death rates (between 1936-45 and 1946-50) the equation of the line is Y = 2166+0-331X. The mean fall in crude death rate 'Y' = 7-5 per thousand and 'the malaria component 'bX' = 5-33 per thousand.</page><page sequence="20">224 R. H.

Similarly, the older individual has a high risk of mortality from malaria acting in conjunction with other pathological factors associated with the debility of age. Following Meegama's suggestion a multiple-regression model was constructed in order to relate the decline in mortality to malaria control and the changes in medical services.63 Unfor- tunately the number of hospitals and hospital beds are not consistently tabulated by district both before and after the war, so these statistics cannot be used as an index of health service improve- ments. However, hospital admissions are consistently recorded in the two periods and admissions per thousand population can be calculated by district, using the year 1938 for the pre-war level, and 1948-49 for the post-war level.64 The increase in hospital utilization can be estimated by the difference in admission rates per thousand, per district between 1948-49 and 1938, and this will be used as an index of changes in central medical service utilization.

GRAY The multiple regression of the proportional decline of average district crude death rates as the dependent variable on changes in malaria prevalence and the population covered by central dispensaries and rural hospitals as the independent variables is shown in Table 14. Only the index of malaria control 'b1' contributed significantly to the regression and the changes in peripheral medical service coverage had no effect upon the differential decline in district mortality rates. The results of the multiple regression analysis are fully consistent with the findings of the previous analysis of the distribution of medical services. Only the control of malaria can explain the differential decline in mortality between districts in post-war Ceylon. The distribution of medical services, or the improvements in such services cannot account for these inter-district differentials. CONCLUSIONS The general conclusion of this analysis is that malaria control was responsible for approximately 23 per cent of the total national post-war decline of mortality in Ceylon, largely through the reduction of the excess mortality in the more malarious areas. Improvements in medical services, therapy, nutrition and possibly economic factors contributed individually indeterminate amounts to the residual decline in national mortality rates. The case for a causal relationship between malaria and mortality is substantial. There is a strong and consistent association between the prevalence of malaria and the pre-war levels of district mortality, and the association holds for the district declines in mortality after malaria control. The relationship is found for crude death rates, age-specific death rates, and cause-specific death rates for malaria and pyrexia of unknown origin. Such an association cannot be demon- strated for other significant variables. The timing of the fall in mortality coincided with the timing of the malaria control campaign; geographically the decline of mortality was related to the previous prevalence of malaria and the fall in death rates was most pronounced among the age groups most vulnerable to malaria. The epidemiological parameters of time, place and person are satisfied, there is a consistent exposure/effect relationship, and the association is plausible in terms of current medical knowledge. Thus, the conventional epidemiological criteria required to establish a causal relationship are fully satisfied.67 EXAMPLES FROM OTHER COUNTRIES The effects of malaria control on mortality can be examined in a number of countries, though the data are less satisfactory than those for Ceylon. Newman analysed the mortality declines related to malaria control in Guyana, using an additive regression model.68 A re-appraisal of the data using the proportional decline in crude death rates as the dependent variable, estimated that malaria control contributed approximately 20 per cent to the reduction in mortality, or a fall in the crude death rate of 1 7 per thousand.69 The malaria prevalence in Guyana was roughly comparable to that of Ceylon. In Guatemala, malaria constituted a more severe problem than in Ceylon, but after the malaria control campaign the crude death rate fell by approximately 3 per thousand and there were no significant changes in medical services or other factors which could haIve been responsible for this abrupt fall in mortality.70 Declines of mortality of a similar order 67 For a discussion of the evaluation of epidemiological hypotheses and the criteria for establishing causality in epidemiological studies see B.

However, the prevalence of malaria had been higher in Mauritius and due to the complex vector situation the disease was a more serious public health problem. Also there were simultaneous improvements in health services which contributed to the reduction in mortality.72 This brief review suggests that the present estimate of the effects of malaria control on mortality in Ceylon is compatible with the experience of other countries. MALARIA CONTROL, FERTILITY AND POPULATION GROWTH The changes in fertility related to malaria control are more complex than the changes in mortality. Newman has shown that there was no association between district crude birth rates and the prevalence of malaria before 1945, but after that year the district birth rates were correlated with the previous level of malaria prevalence. There also was a rise in fertility after the war and the increase in the district crude birth rates was positively correlated with the spleen rates of 1938-41.73 This led Newman to the conclusion that in the endemic areas, prior to 1946, malaria inhibited conception during the malarial season, but during the non-malarial season the probability of conception was increased as a 'greater effort was being made to have children in face of the higher pre-natal, infant and adult morality rates'. This produced 'ingrained habits of procreation' in the population which persisted after malaria was controlled and resulted in a rise of fertility in the previously endemic areas.74 The increase in the national crude birth rate after malaria control is not very pronounced75 and there are a number of factors which could introduce biases in the application of a regression model, leading to a spurious association between the control of malaria and a rise in fertility. The reduction in early infant mortality and the increased supervision of births produced by the post- war extension of maternity services led to improved birth registration in the malarious areas more than in the non-malarious areas, and this tends to inflate the numerator in the birth rates of the former areas.76 Socio-economic factors such as the new land colonization programmes in the previously malarious districts could have selectively affected fertility and there were secular demographic trends, for example a war-time rise in the marriage rate and a post-war 'baby- boom', which were conducive to increased fertility and were independent of malaria control.77 The medical evidence concerning the inhibitory effects of malaria or fertility is equivocal and a review of the data from a number of countries suggests that there is no consistent association between malaria control and changes in fertility.78 In view of the complexity of the factors under- 71 S.

GRAY lying fertility and the limitations of the regression analysis, Newman's conclusion that malaria control was responsible for the rise in the Ceylonese birth rate cannot be accepted without con- siderable reservation. From the preceding analysis it is possible to assess the effects of malaria control on popula- tion growth. Using the proportional regression model it was estimated that the malaria control programme resulted in a decline in the crude death rate of 2 3 per thousand and had only negligible effects on the changes in the crude birth rate. The average crude rate of natural increase for the period 1946-60 was 26 1 per thousand. Thus, if the malaria programme had not occurred, the average crude rate of natural increase for 1946-60 would have been approximately 23 8 per thousand (26 1- 23). Applying these growth rates to the population of 1945 it is estimated that the population at the end of 196079 would have been approximately 9,957,000 at the observed average rate of natural increase of 26 1 per thousand. However, if the malaria campaign had not occurred and the average crude rate of natural increase had been 23 8 per thousand, the population at the end of 1960 would have been approximately 9,696,000. So the excess population growth attribut- able to malaria control is around 261,000 (9,957,000-9,696,000). This is a much more conserva- tive estimate of the impact of malaria control on population growth than that derived by Newman who stated that 'the campaign resulted in almost a million more people . . . being alive at the end of 1960 than would have been otherwise'.80 The extreme disparity between those two estimates of population growth attributable to malaria control result from fundamental differences in the methodology employed in the two analyses. Firstly, as has been shown, the additive regression model tends to overestimate the mortality decline due to malaria control and arrives at an estimate twice that derived from the proportional regression model. Secondly, Newman assumes that the elimination of malaria led to a rise in the crude birth rate, but as discussed previously, this assumption is of doubtful validity. Furthermore, Newman's model actually implies that in the absence of the malaria campaign the average national crude birth rate for 1946-60 would have fallen by 1 082 per thousand. This implication arises from the fact that the putative change in birth rates which would have occurred independently of malaria control is estimated from the constant term in the regression equation equation derived from the intercept of the regression line and the abscissa where the prevalence of malaria is zero.8' It is assumed that the fertility experience of a few relatively non-malarious districts is indicative of a national trend in fertility had the malaria campaign not occurred. However, the majority of the non-endemic districts experienced increased or constant fertility in the post-war era and Colombo with an average spleen rate in 1938-41 of 2 4 per cent had a rise in average crude birth rate of 5 6 per thousand.82 Also, there is no pre-war decline in the birth rate indicative of a secular trend which might have resulted in a post-war reduction of fertility.83 Thus, there is no real justification for the assumption that the national crude birth rate would have declined if the prevalence of malaria had remained constant. In summary, Newman's estimates of population growth which in part depend upon these fertility assumptions, overestimate the contribution of malaria control acting via fertility on the increase in population.84 7 The population growth was calculated over the 15 years between 1945 and 1960 in order to facilitate a com- parison with Newman's estimate of population increase.

Barlow undertook an economic analysis of malaria control in Ceylon using Newman's estimates of population growth and she concluded that 'the main economic disadvantages of eradication are seen to lie in the rapid increase of population'.

This constitutes a post-war rise in the rate of natural increase of 11-9 per thousand of which it is estimated that malaria control was responsible for 2-3 points through the reduction in the crude death rate. Thus the control of malaria accounts for approximately 19 per cent of the post-war acceleration in the rate of population growth.85 85 Newman, op. cit.
