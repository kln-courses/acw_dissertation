<plain_text><page sequence="1">( 219 ) A PROVISIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF THE SWORDS OF THE SARAWAK TRIBES. BY R. SHELFORD, M.A., C.M.Z.S. [PRESENTED 12TH NOVEMBER, 1901. WITH PLATES XVI, XVII.] THE great majority of Bornean swords found in the ethnographical collections of European museums bear on their labels merely the vaguest and most insufficient data as to place of origin, nature, function, etc., a matter of little surprise seeing that practically no literature relating to these weapons exists. The following paper, treating of the swords of the Sarawak tribes, seeks in part to remedy this. I have drawn up brief diagnostic descriptions of all the varieties of swords from Sarawak with which I am acquainted, have briefly classified them and given their tribal distribution; the synoptical key at the end of the paper, though perhaps as artificial as such keys usually are, will, I hope, enable museum curators to identify readily and correctly most of the specimens of Bornean swords ill the collections under their charge. The paper is the result of researches and inquiries extending over a period of three years, and though I have no doubt that further researches along the same lines will bring to light fresh ilnformation, I have no reason to believe that the classification that I have adopted will be altered in any important detail,l at the same time it is capable of extension and must therefore be looked on as provisional only. The illustrations are taken from specimens in my own collection, but the specimens in the Sarawak Museum collection have, through the mouths of reliable natives, yielded much valuable information, and I have also seen many examples in the possession of various officers of the Sarawak service. The kris, a, double-edged dagger, essentially a Malay weapon, and the komrpilan, a long two-handed sword, used by the Ilanun pirates, who frequent the coasts of many of the Malayan Islands, are not discussed here, although met with in Borneo. It should be noted that though some of the swords here described are intended primarily for use in warfare, they may also serve as agricultural implements or as carpentering tools or vice versd. Terminology ern.ployed.&amp;-Parang is the Malay and Sea-Dyak word for these weapons, and will be used in preference to the English word sword. The blade of a paratng measures from 50 to 100 centimetres in length; it has a back, an edge, and two sides. When held in the right hand with the back A few swords from Dutch Borneo that I have seen since this paper was written do not differ at all markedly from those from Sarawak.</page><page sequence="2">Journal of the Anthropologieal In8titute, V ol.

The edge is anterior and the back is posterior; any pattern which is nearer to the one or the other is respectively anterior or posterior. The back may be straight or with a concave curvature, it never has a convex curvature. The edge sinmilarly may be straight or with a convex curvature, it never has a concave curvature. The blade rnay also have a slight outward curvature. The sides of the blade may be flat or as in the parang ilang the ininer side is concave and the outer convex in an antero-posterior direction (in left-handed parang ilang these aspects are of course reversed). The edge rarely reaches up to the handle, the intervening portion mnay be termed the shoulder. The back and the edge may pass insensibly into the poilnt of the blade, but most frequently the back is much shorter than the edge, so that the blade appears as if it had been obliquely truncated; this truncate edge may be termed the slope; the angle and consequently the length of the slope vary considerably in the different varieties of parangs. The haindle, which is made either of stag's horn, bone or wood, is always carved and frequently decorated with tufts of dyed hair. The blade is inserted into a hollowed-out part of the handle alnd secuired by a stopping of stick-lac. That part of the handle which is held in the hand is served with plaited rattan, wire, or metal rings, and is ter-ned the grip. The decorated part of the handle is not held in the hanld, anct is termed the head. The sheath is invariably coinposed of two grooved slats of wood rouchly of the shape of the blade and bound together by plaited rattan or wire; alonig the inner side of the-sheath there is generally lashed a bark pocket containing a smuall knife with a long, angled handle. The parang is -worni strapped to the left hip, with the edge directe6d upwards. The following is a list of the varieties of parangs known to me, with their tribal distribution:- 1. Pdrang lang . .

Parang ilang.4-This is the term applied by Malays and Sea-Dyaks to- the weapon of the Kayans and allied tribes mentioned above; the meaning of the word ilang I have not been able to ascertain. The blade of this weapon (Plate XVI,</page><page sequence="5">R. SHILFORD. -A Provisional Classification of the Swords of the Sarawak Tribegs. 221 lower left), which varies in length from 50-70 cenltimetres, differs from that of all others in being concave on the inner side and. convex on the outer side in an antero-posterior direction; the blade also curves slightly outwards. At the greatest breadth of the blade, the back ceases and there is a slope which varies mnuch in length. The edge of the blade ceases at about 8 centimetres from the han,dle, resulting in the formation of a shoulder. A pattern generally occupies the shoulder and runs along the posterior part of the blade on its outer aspect only till it reaches the slope. The pattern may be either incised or fretted, or made up of silver and brass hammered into the body of the blade, or a combination of all three of these methods may be employed; less frequently the blade is quite plain. The elements of the patterns with whiclh I am acquainted are as follows:-undoh asu, a dragon design; ulai nipca, or snake design, being, a continuous scroll pattern; icaran, short incised lines, arranged in groups of two or three; merkutaqi, brass or silver studs hamnmered itto the blade, solmietimes completely perforating it; lukut, a brass stud enclosed in a brass circle, supposed to represent a valuable and ancient bead, strings of which are worn by chiefs. All these elements mlay occur on one blade. The slope of the blade is very variable, both in length, curvature and orna- inentation, and by virttue of these differences, and of variations in pattern, the natives subdivide the parang ilang into numerous varieties; the schenmes of classification of the various tribes do not coincide, and the names of identically similar varieties' interchange in the most bewildering manner, as one travels from one district to another. The following is the classification of the Kajamans of the Belaga district, Upper IRejang river, Sarawak. The generic term song means end or termination, as e.y, song irang-shoots of bamnboo. 1. Song bila-a fret-work pattern on the slope. 2. Song ikang-hookcs or projections on the slope. 3. Song bang-slope not fretted nor produced into hooks and projections but perfectly plain, or excised into a series of short concave curves. 4. Song but-slope rounded and sometimes sharpened into a cutting edge. 5. Song batong-fret-work at intervals all along the blade. 6. Song belubong-an identical pattern on both sides of the blade. Of the two parang ilang illustrated, that on the left (a) is 'by this classification a song ikang, the other (b) is a song bang of simple type. The Peng Kayan (a tribe of the Mahakkam river, Dutch Borneo) name for this however is song apong, whilst the Leppu Tau Kenyahs of the Batang Kayan river, Dutch Borneo, give a namie to the more ornate type of song bang, which means swallow's wings. The varieties song bila and song ilkang are not always readily distinguishable, In the Baram district the word bila seems to be used instead of song. The Sarawak Museum has a fine series of these weapons, illustrating all the above-noted variations. The anterior edge of the shoulder is frequently provided with a pair of hook-like projections (ilkang), constituting a sort of rudimentary finger-guard, the</page><page sequence="6">222 P. SHELFORD.-A Provisional Classification of the Swordls of the Sarawakc Tribes. hooks when present are part of a dragon design incised on the shoulder and represent the horns of the dragon. The handle is usually made of stag's horn, but occasionally of wood; the stag's antler is cut through at the burr, the beam and the brow tine are cut short; the, cut ends are then hollowed out, and the blade of the parang is inserted into the beam, and a long tuft of dyed goat's-hair (q?jeh) is fastened with dammnar in the cut end of the burr, which is smoothed down, and a shorter tuft in that of the brow tine; both burr and brow tine are elaborately carved with a complicated dragoll and anthropomorphic design, and constitute the head of the handle. The beam forms the grip of the handle and is served with plaited rattan or wire; the insertion of the blade into the handle is concealed by a thick ring of dammar, into which is frequently stuck a silver coin or stud. The head is further decorated with short tufts of hair inserted into small holes which are bored for the purpose. Such a type of handle is shown in specimen (a). In the Mahakkamn river another type of handle is more frequently met with; in this, the blade is inserted into the smoothed-down burr, and the cut ends of the beam and of the brow tine form a Y-shaped head, carved and decorated with hair: specimen (b). In a third type of handle, confined also to Dutch Borneo, the blade is inserted into the beam, but the burr and brow tine are so carved as to form a right-angled crutch. The sheath, which corresponds roughly in shape to the blade, is made of two grooved slabs of wood tightly bound together by four or five lashings of rattan or wire: the rattan lashings are generally plaited in a very complicated manner, and the term " Katong evok," meaning the twistings of a whirlpool, is applied to them; under the lashings are inserted tufts of hair generally red and white arranged alternately (bok say). Between the first and second lashings on the outer side of the sheath there is almost invariably a pointed plaque of wood, cut out from the body of the sheath, or if of bone, lashed to the sheath; this is known as the belilap, and is either elaborately carved with the dragon design or decorated with hair; a strip of skin covered with hair passes under it round the sheath. The interspaces between the other lashings are sometimes occupied by carvings, or carved pieces of bone are let into the sheath. Sometimes the point of the sheath is closed by a stop of bone, the sibong. The inner side of the sheath, which is quite plain, has a bark pocket, the apis, attached to it; the apis contailns a small knife, the nyiu, with a long haindle; to the outer side of the apis is frequently sewn a strip of bead-work. Threaded through the apis and under the strip of skin encircling the sheath is the sword-belt or blavit of plaited rattan covered with cloth or bead-work; one end of the blavit terminates in a loop, the other end is knotted to form a toggle, the skabat. Sometimes the toggle is elaborately carved from a piece of rhinoceros horn or from the casque of the solid-casqued hornbill Rhinoplax vigil. 2. Niabor.-This is the characteristic Sea-Dyak parang, the others mentioned below are of quite recent origin and owe their shape to Kayan or Kenyah influences. The blade of the niabor (Plate XVI, upper right) is generally about 60 centimetres long,- but a specimen in the Sarawak Museum measures 90 centimetres. The</page><page sequence="7">R. SIHELFORD.-A Provisional Classification of the Swords of the Sarawalk Tribes. 223 back and edge both have a pronounced anterior curvature and pass insensibly to the point; the blade is broadest near the point, and gradually tapers proximally until the edge suddenly ceases at soirme distance from the handle; midway between this point and the insertion of the handle projects a large finger-guard, the kundieng, a feature which is entirely diagnostic of this type of weapon. Distal of this finger-guard, the anterior border of the blade is squarely emarginate, and the space is known as the sangau; proximal of the finger-guard the blade is rounded or polygonal in section, and in reality constitutes part of the handle; this part of it is known as the tamporian. The blade is rarely ornamented, occasionally however a groove rulns along the posterior border on both sides, from the tamporian to near the point. The handle is carved from stag's horn or wood; in the former case the same part of the antler is used as in the parang ilang, and the blade is inserted into the cut enld of the beam; the head of the handle is much flattened laterally, and the brow tine is whittled away and forms a very acute angle with the beam; the burr is carved into a small knob. A phyllomorphic pattern is carved on the head of the handle. The following are the names of the iusual patterns :-Cantok resaqm (shoots of Gleichenia dichotoma), telingai (scorpion), entadoik kaul (caterpillars interlocking). The grip is served with rings of metal known as grwnieng. No hair is ever attached to the handle or sheath. The sheath calls for no special notice. 3. Langgai tinggang.-This, another Sea-Dyak parang (PI. XVII, upper r.), is practically a niabor with the handle of a parang ilang. The term langgai tinggang, meaning the longest tail-feather of a hornbill, is applied to this weapon by reason of a broad groove which runs along the posterior part of the blade on each side, and which is fancifully supposed to be feather-like in appearance; this groove runs across to the anterior border just below the rudimentary finger-guard. This finger- guard is not a derivative of the kundieng of the niabor, but is a copy of the ikang of the parang ilang, which, as already shown, qonstituted part of a dragon design; the Sea-Dyak term crowit or hooks shows that this has no connection with the kundieng.1 Each side of the shoulder is incised with a phyllomorphic design, such as those given on the preceding page. The sides of the broad groove running along the blade may be bordered with a simple scroll pattern, e9tadok, or caterpillar. The handle of a langgai tingganig differs in nowise from that of a parang ilang. The sheath is also similar except in shape. 4. Jimpul.-The jimnpul is of quite recent origin, i.e., withinl the last thirty years, and may be considered as a hybrid between the parang ilang and the langgai tinggang. The blade (PI. XVI, lower r.) has flat sides and both back and edge have a strong anterior curvature, thus resembling the two precedino types of paxrangs. The back and edge however do not pass insensibly to a point, but there is a short 1 I have, however, a drawing by Dr. iiller, of Philadelphia, of a lan,qgai tinggang with a kundieng instead of crowit, but it is the onily example of such a variation that has ever come to my knowledge.</page><page sequence="8">224 R. SHELFORD.-A Provisional Classification of the Swords of the Sarawak Tribes. and abrupt slope. The blade at the commencement of the slope is very broad, the difference in breadth between this point and at a point near the handle being as much as 2 5 centimetres. Hooks and projections (krowit) or a fret design occur on the slope, and sometimes for a short distance along the back; two or three grooves run along the posterior part of the blade on each side, anid each side of the shoulder is inlcised with a plhyllomorphic pattern. A rudiimentary finger-guard (krowit) of the same niature as those of the parang ilagig and lanygai tinggctng is generally present; iln the specimen illustrated the hooks constituting this finger-guard constitute part of the phyllomorphic desigrn (telingai) ilncised on the shoulder of tlle blade, but this is unusual, for as a rule the finger-guiard being slavishly copied from a Kayan model as in the langgati tinggang, bears no sort of relation to the design on the shoulder of the blade which is not copied from a Kayan model. As the Sea-Dyaks have now taken to making the parang ilang themselves, embellished with degraded copies of Kayan designs, it is not surprising to meet with specimens of the jimpul similarly ornamented, but it should be remembered that phyllomorphic designs are essentially the characteristic designs of the Sea-Dyak men,' and a foreign influence is to be suspected when a zoomorphic or antlhropomorphic design is encountered in the decoration of their parangs. The handle of the jimrpul needs no descriptionl, being a direct copy of the parang ilang lhandle. The sheath similarly is copied from that of the parang iltng. 5. Baynt.-The Baym is also a Sea-Dyak parang of modern origin. It is a modificatioln of the type of piaranig ilang, known by the Kajamans as song but; in the song, but (p. 221) the slope is roundecl and frequently sharpened into a cutting edge; the inner side of the blade is, however, concave and unornamented the outer side is convex and ornamented with a pattern along the posterior border. The bayn (Pl. XVI, lower r.) is sharpenled along the back as far as the shoulder, so that the b)lade in section is oval, the pattern is identical on both outer and inner aspects ancd runs down the centre of the blade, not along, the posterior border only. In the specimen illustrated, the ornainentationl of the blade consists of two broa(l and two narrow grooves runnsing from the shoulder lnearly to the point, and on the shoulder of incised lines and brass stuids. The edge is nearly straight, but the slharpened back lihas a slight convex curvatture near the point, andl the blade is lhere broader than at aniy other point. The halndle anid sheath are of the usual pa? rang ilany type. The following, are the Sea-Dyak terms for the various parts of a parang: Handlle, ikil; ringt of dammgnar concealing insertion of blade, balut; finlger-guard, krowit; incised lines on blade (Kyan, kru-arn), kowafl; trianlgular panel on outer side of sheath (Kyani, belilaop), tanidup; bolle stop at end of sheath, sakurn; lashings of sheath, kowiit; hair, jabor; belt, szpci.

SHELFORD.-A Provisional Classificationt of thbe Swtoords of the Sarawa7c Tribes. 225 6. Paleayun.-Tlhis is the very characteristic parang of the Muruts, a tribe inhabiting parts of Northern Borneo. The long, curved, cutlass-like blade (P]. XVII, upper 1.) measures 60-65 centimetres' in lenigth and about 3 centi- metres in breadth; it is of almost uniform diameter throughout. The back is slightly shorter than the edge, so that there is a short slope. The back near its termination is occasionally bevelled for a short distance. The blade is never ornamented. The handle is invariably made of wood, ancd the head is peculiar and distinctive in shape. It mlay be compared with the Y-shaped handle of stag's horn of the Mahakkam river _parang ilang; the blade is inserted into the stalk of the Y, corresponding to the burr of the antler, and the limbs of the Y, correspondin, to the beam and brow tines of the antler, and forming the head of the handle, are curved forwards (i.e., downwards, if the parang is held in the natural way with the back of the blade uppermost); the space between the limbs of the Y is filled in with a carving which may extend, as in the specimen exhibited, far beyond the ends of the limbs of the Y. The handle of the specimen illustrated is of rather an ornate nature, more usually the carving is simpler and less extexisive. The grip of the handle is supplied by a cylinder of brass expanding at the insertion of the blade into a circular lip, the umbo, which serves as a finger-guard. This cylinder rarely extenids up to the point of divarication of the limbs of the Y, and the interspace is covered by plaited rattan. The sheath as usual is made of two slats of wood bound together by rattan, wire, or strips of tiln; the spaces between these, binldings are occupied on the outer side by geometrical designs. To the inner side is attached a bark pocket decorated with hair. 7. Pctrang pedang.-The parang pedang or pedang is used by the Malays and Milanos (a coastal tribe that has embraced Islam), chiefly for such purposes as the felling of jungle or the splitting-up of the logs of the sago palm. The blade (PI. XVII, lower 1.), which measures in length about 60 centimetres,l is very strongly curved, very broad in the distal third, measuring as much as 6-5 centinmetres, and taperinig rapidly to the point of insertion into the handle. The back passes insensibly to the point so that there is no slope, and the edge runs up almost to the handle, so that a shoulder is not distinguishable. The blade is quite free from ornamentation. The handle, the shape of which is characteristic of this and of the two parangs described below, is invariably made of wood. The head of the handle is formed by a forwardly directed kniob; the under surface of the knob is concavely curved, and runs into the grip; the uipper surface is convexly curved, and is transversely grooved, so that a varied mouilding is produced; the sides of the knob are flattened. The grip is served with plaited rattan. The sheath is quite simple in character. 8. Latok.-Used chiefly by Malays and Milanos, though introduced into other tribes comparatively recently. I These measurements refer to tbe specimens figured, which are all deposited at preselit in the Pitt-Rivers Museum, Oxford. VO)L, XXXI,</page><page sequence="10">226 R., SHELFORDP. -A Pr-ovisional Classi:flcation of the Swords of the Sarawa7l Tqibes. The chief characteristic of this parang is the open angle which the shoulder of the blade and the handle form with the rest of the blade. In the specinmen illustrated (P1. XVII, lower r.), the blade measures from its tip to the distal poinlt of the shoulder 52 centimetres, and the length of the shoulder is 6 centimetres. The greatest breadth, 5 5 cenitimetres, is near the point, the smallest 2 5 centimetres at the angle of the shoulder. The back is a trifle shorter than the edge, and runs in a very steep alnd curved slope to the point; the back is very thick so that in its middle the blade is wedge-shaped in section. The shoulder is cut square, but may be polygonal in section or even rounded; in the Milano sadap, a variety of latoki, the shoulder is octagonal in section. The handle is of the same type as in the parang pedang, I.e., the head is formed by a forwardly projecting knob of wood, and the upper border of this knob is " moulded " by transverse grooves. The grip is usually served by wire or plaited rattan, but sonmetimes, as in the specimen illustrated, by silver rings elaborately decorated with geometrical and phyllo- morphic designs worked in repoussJ. The sheath, which is quite straight, does not enclose the angled shoulder; the end is usually cut square. The parang, which is used largely for agricultural purposes, is grasped by the handle and shoulder of the blade in both hands, and is then a highly effective chopping implement. 9. Bnleo.-This is the parang used by the Land-Dyaks; it differs principally from the iatok, by its snmaller size and elaborately carved handle. The blade (P1. XVII, lower r.) measures from tip to distal point of shoulder about 45 centi- metres, the shoulder is 7 centimetres long and rectangular in section; the greatest breadth of the blade is 4 to 4-5 centimetres; otherwise the blade is exactly similar to the lactok. The handle is of the type described for the two preceding parangs, but the head is elaborately carved in deep relief the pattern is supposed to represent the leaves of a wild mango, graiwim. The handle of the specimen exhibited is characteristic of the Betah Land-Dyaks of the Quop river, a branch of the Sarawak river; the Bennah of the head-waters of the Sarawak river make a much smaller handle, the Sempok a much larger handle, whilst the Pinyawa of the Samarahan river do not carve the head of the handle at all, and shave down the upper border of the projecting knob till in side view the head appears triangular. The grip is served with rattan. The sheath is straight and does not enclose the angled shoulder; the mouth of the sheath is carved in deep relief with a phyllomorphic design, and the end of the sheath is perforated with small holes into which are fixed, by wedges of wood, tufts of hair. The two slats of wood composing, the sheath are bound together by loops of plaited rattan-burad; burad patung is a 5-ply loop, burad kirqing a 7-ply loop, burad ti,piris a 9-ply loop, bnrad brad bodad a 11-, 13-, 15-, or 19-ply loop. The belt known as taris, is made of the lining of the sheathing leaves of a palm. 10. Pandat.-The pandat is the war parang of the Laind-Dyaks; it is never used in agriculture or hanidicrafts as is the bulo. It is characterised (P1. XVI,</page><page sequence="11">R. SHELFORD.-A Provisional Classficattion of the Swvords of the Sarawak Tril&lt;es. 227 upper 1.) by the lack of a proper handle, the elongate and angled shoulder serving the purpose: a hole is bored through the shoulder of the blade in aii antero- posterior direction near]y in the middle, and through this is inserted a short iron bar, the seka7c, forming a cross-piece; the shoulder terminates in a sharp poilnt, capped by a piece of horn; the surface of the shoulder, which is rectangular in section, is covered 'vith tin-foil or with brass, and some hair is attaclLed to the back. The portion of the shoulder proximal of the sekak is grasped, the forefinger passing over the anterior half of the sekak. The back of the blade in the specimen exhibited is longer than the edge, and the oblique end so formed is cut with a V-shaped notch forming a re-entering angle; this arrangement is characteristic of the Sidin Land-Dyaks; sometimes the blade and edge are of equal length, in which case the limbs of the re-entering angle are equal ini length; or the limlbs of the re-entering angle may be produced into short hooks or projections, and brass studs driven into the blade near its termination; this arrangement is characteristic of the Bennah Land-Dyaks. The sheath is straight and does not enclose the ancgled shoulder; its outer aspect is decorated with grooves in low relief forming geometrical designs, and with phyllomorphic designs; the designs may or may not be filled up with tin-foil; the phyllomorphic design at the end of the sheath occurs on both sides.

SHELFORD.-A Provisional Classificationt of the Swords of the Sarawak Tribes. DISCUSSION. Mr. H. BALFOUR said:-Anthropologists will feel much indebted to Mr. Shelford for havilng laid down this classification of Bornean swords. In addition to the interest attaching to the subject, there will be practical application for his classification, since the curators of museunms will now be able to label and describe correctly the weapons from this region. Too often one sees in museunms such labels as " Dyak sword fronm Borneo" attached to specimens as the only information offered to the public, and too frequelntly the weapon is neither a Dyak onie nor a sword, and moreover Borneo is an extensive region in which mnarked local distinctions are apparent, which should be specified. It is not always the fault of the curator, who very frequently has none but the vaguest information sent to him. Mr. Shelford's scientific classification will, I anm sure, be welcomed by all who aim at the proper systematic arrangement of collections comprising the particular weapons and tools with which he deals. I should like to ask Mr. Shelford to what extent the parang ilanq is used as a weapon, and what are the peculiar cuts which render this unique form of blade efficient. It seems as though a direct cut at right angles to a surface would not be very effective, alnd a diagonal cut would tend to glance off if the concave surface of the blade were towards the object slashed at. On the other hand, it would seem that such a cut with the concave side towards the object would be dangerous and effective, as the tendency of the blade would be to bury itself deeply in this case. Similarly, I should like to be informed as to the correct use of the very awkward-looking latok and _pandat. For a downward cut these appear to be highly inefficient, as the balance seems to be all wrong, throwing a great strain upoll the wrist. They are well balanced for an upward cut, but this would perhaps not be a very effective form of attack. In regard to the forins of decoration, I should wish to ask Mr. Shelford whether it caln be ascertained to what extent the patterns were originally intended to represent, the objects whose name is associated with the designs, or, on the other hand, whether those names have been given to the patterns merely because of a fancied resemblance to natural objects arrived at accidentally in the process of making variations upon existing designs, which in the first instance were not intended to represent those objects. Patterns may acquire names in either manner, and it is important to record when possible the manner in which a particular name has become associated with a given pattern. Mr. SHELFORD replied that the pardcig ilang is used with a glancing cut with the concave surface towards the object, anld inakes in this manner a deep and effective cut. The latok and pandat are not used for an upward cut, but for a downward one, in which both hands are used. It is impossible to determinie for certain whether the names of the patterns are derived from an original attempt to represent the objects whose names they bear now, or whether the namnes have been given in consequence of real or fancied resemblances arrived at accidentally during the processIof varying existing patterns,</page></plain_text>
