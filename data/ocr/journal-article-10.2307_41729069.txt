ARCHAEOLOGY NEWS A Moche stirrup-spouted bottle in the form of an anthropo- morphized monkey, dating to about a.D. 350. Stolen Treasures-Missing Links by Ellen Herscher On the evening of May 18, 1983, the National Geographic Society headquar- ters was the setting for a typical Wash- ington reception. Its Explorers Hall was lavishly spread with food and drink and filled with distinguished guests, includ- ing the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Javier Perez de Cuellar. The guests of honor, however, were somewhat unusual. They neither ate nor drank nor made speeches- they were 500 Preco- lumbian Peruvian artifacts. The party, co-hosted by the Embassy of Peru, celebrated the opening of an exhibition, Stolen Treasures- Missing Links (through December 1983), an ex- hibition which vividly highlights the destruction caused by the looting of archaeological sites. The material used in the show was selected from more than 700 pieces seized from art dealers and returned to the government of Peru by the United States in 1982, material which had been smuggled out of Peru as part of the illicit international traffic in antiquities. The recovery of the collection illus- trates how the U.S. Customs Service is aggressively attacking this traffic. Most of the objects were found in the posses- sion of David Bernstein, a young art dealer from New York, who was stopped at Washington's Dulles International Airport in January 1981. Arriving from Lima, Peru, he carried four suitcases which, he told the customs officer, con- tained 66 Peruvian artifacts with an estimated value of $1,785. When the bags were opened, agents found 158 objects, including a gold "death mask," textiles, ceramics, and a feather poncho. When the horrible stench of the objects nearly drove the agents from the search room, Bernstein explained that the items had just been dug up from tombs. The suspicious agents called Clifford Evans, an expert in South American archaeology from the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, and officials from the Peruvian Embassy to examine the detained material. The shocked and angry Evans attested to the extreme rarity and importance of the objects (their value was later placed at $288,000), and rapidly left the room, saying he felt ill. He suffered a fatal heart attack a few hours later. The Peruvians said the material was stolen, since according to their laws all Preco- lumbian artifacts found after 1929 are the property of the state. The suitcases were not the only thing that smelled: a later search of Bernstein's 58 ARCHAEOLOGY</page><page sequence="2">A Moche stirrup-spouted bottle of about a.D. 250 in the form of a mythical hero on a fish boat with two captives and ani- mal assistants.

The gov- ernment of Peru threatened to press criminal charges under the National Stolen Property Act of the U.S., which makes it illegal to transport stolen goods worth more than $5,000 in interstate or international commerce. Eventually the case was resolved by a plea-bargaining arrangement. Bernstein pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor of making a false declaration to customs officials and agreed to return the artifacts to Peru. He was given a $1,000 fine and a one- year sentence (suspended), and was required to perform 200 hours of com- munity service. The total market value of Bernstein's material has been placed at approxi- mately one-and-a-half million dollars, but this was not the main reason for Evans' agitation or the Peruvians' outrage. Evans had recognized immediately that many of the items were unduplicated in museum and archaeological collections, and that many of them must have come from sites totally unknown to scholars: the loss of knowledge was incalculable. The Peruvians saw that they were once again being systematically deprived of their "cultural patrimony." Precolumbian antiquities are symbols of the long history of their country's greatness, and thus an essential part of their sense of national identity. In essence, their pride was being stolen. Both these losses- knowledge and national pride - are illustrated and mourned in the National Geographic ex- hibition. The inherent destruction of looting is shown vividly in photographs of sites in Peru and Bolivia, pock-marked by the looters' pits, human bones and broken pottery chaotically strewn about. Other graphic elements in this section of the show are a film of tomb robbers in action in the Andean highlands of South America (by Manuel Guzm√°n, a Colom- bian anthropologist) and one of David Bernstein's confiscated suitcases, re- stored to its condition on that January day in 1981, overflowing with silver, gold and pottery. Juxtaposed with the evi- dence of illicit activity is documentation of some of the efforts being made to alleviate the problem: descriptions of international treaties and agreements, names and addresses of networks for publicizing stolen art, and audio-visual reconstructions of U.S. Customs proce- dures. This part of the exhibition contrasts with another section showing how a site is scientifically excavated and what can be learned from archaeological context. Archaeologists' delicate recording in- struments and small brushes are com- pared with the probes, large picks, dynamite, and bulldozers used by the greedy huaqueros. Smuggled objects are used in a display showing stratification and cross-dating; in a videotape, a looted Moche owl-shaped vessel mourns the loss of its rightful historical identity ("I speak in broken sentences"). The message here is that the little scholarly information, such as age and geographic origin, that is known about the objects in this show is the result of scientific archaeological studies of unplundered sites. (Thus, ironically, legitimate work serves to enhance the values in the illicit market. ) Peruvian pride The patriotic importance to the Peru- vian nation of its Precolumbian antiq- uities is clearly shown elsewhere in the exhibit. One section presents the his- torical perspective, placing the seven main Andean cultures represented by the material in the context of world civilizations of the past 3,000 years. For visitors whose archaeological orienta- tion is mainly toward the Old World, it is a revelation to see the sophisticated technique and complex iconography of Chavin pottery from about the time of Homer, the colorful and elaborate Para- cas textiles contemporary with the Par- thenon, and the remains of the great Huari and Tiahuanaco empires which flourished when Europe was fragmenting into feudalism. The high level of mate- rial existence achieved by these peoples is apparent throughout the exhibition in the quantities of textiles, feather gar- ments, incised bone instruments, carved wood, jewelry of precious stones and metals, silver cups, cloth dolls, and September/October 1983 59</page><page sequence="3">This Chavin Blackware stirrup vessel in the " Tembladera style" of the first millennium b.c. depicts two snakes and a cactus.

Prom this can be in- ferred additional information about everyday usage of plants, animals, boats, clothing and ornaments, and sacred and secular architecture. The final section of the show attempts to look into the minds of these ancient people, to understand their spiritual legacy to the modern Peruvians. The complicated religious symbolism por- trayed in ceramics receives the most attention, but healing techniques, math- ematical use of the quipu ( sets of knotted cords used by the Inca for record keep- ing), and the role of warfare are also presented as significant aspects. Of particular interest is the Mochica ceramic portraiture, which reveals the human aspect of its people as few artistic traditions have done- noble warriors, deformed visages, drug chewers, sailors, prisoners and priests, people cooking and washing, a family sleeping in close embrace. Such representations seem immediately accessible to the modern mind and have thus, unfortunately, long been popular with collectors. The quantity, wealth and variety of the material in Stolen Treasures - Missing Links will attract considerable attention everywhere the exhibition travels. What may be less noticed is that the show itself embodies something unprecedented in the United States, and perhaps in any country - the active cooperation of an art-importing nation in recovering and returning antiquities to a plundered state. This new atmo- sphere represents a considerable change in attitude since 1969, when art historian Clemency Coggins published an article, "Illicit TVaffic of Pre-Columbian Antiq- uities," in The Art Journal , in which she noted the presence of many suspect objects in the U.S. Wider public aware- ness began in 1973 when three articles by journalist Karl E. Meyer appeared in The New Yorker and were later incorpo- rated into his book, The Plundered Past. Controlling illicit trade An increasing number of such outcries led to a series of treaties and interna- tional agreements which have facilitated efforts to control the illicit trade: treaties of cooperation providing for recovery and return of stolen cultural property with (Below) A Moche stirrup-spouted bottle in Fine Line style , dating to about a.D. 450 , shows a hero in a reed boat of the type still used on Lake Titicaca.

Mexico (1971) and Peru (1981), a law regulating the importation of Precolum- bian monumental or architectural sculp- ture and murals (1972), and the 1972 Unesco Convention on Cultural Prop- erty, now ratified by 51 countries (the U.S. became the latest signatory in June 1983). In addition, a number of court decisions and other legal proceedings, such as the Bernstein case, have demon- strated that standard civil and criminal remedies can be effectively applied for the recovery of stolen cultural property, including looted antiquities. Yet in spite of the excitement gener- ated by the return of this group of objects to Peru, the ultimate objective of all international efforts is not recovery per se , but deterrence of looting in the first place. Countless archaeological sites were destroyed in the acquisition of this "stolen treasure," and the information they contained can never be recovered. Thus, these regulatory measures are relying upon the principal of supply and demand: if the demand for illicitly acquired antiquities can be restricted, the plundering that supplies that market will consequently decrease. But, as Prohibition demonstrated and current problems with narcotics traffic suggest, laws without widespread public support are insufficient. So it is encour- aging to see that this new era of coopera- tion is beginning to extend beyond the legal realm. Since 1970 an increasing number of American museums have refused to buy or accept artifacts without proper pedigree. Other recent large- scale traveling loan exhibitions, from Egypt, Greece, Thailand, China, and the U.S.S.R., have enabled millions of Amer- icans to see spectacular antiquities never before out of their country of origin. American museum experts and archae- ologists, as well as international repre- sentatives of Unesco, have been invited to less-developed countries to assist in the scientific preservation of their cul- tural heritage. Americans have also been financially generous in support of such projects as the rescue of Abu Simbel in Egypt and Borobudur in Java. An international foundation, with headquarters in the U.S., is now helping to raise funds for a new National Mu- seum of Anthropology and Archaeology in Lima, to which the objects in the National Geographic show will finally return. The careful planning of this museum and the training of its staff are further testimony to the importance Peru attaches to its Precolumbian patrimony. Undoubtedly the stolen treasures w√ºl find the conservation laboratories and environmentally controlled storage areas more inviting than the National Geo- graphic^ buffet. But before they go home, they will have accomplished an invaluable educational and diplomatic mission as eloquent public witnesses to the destruction that brought them here in the first place.
