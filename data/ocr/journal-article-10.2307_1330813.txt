<plain_text><page sequence="1">5I6 HARVARD LAW REVIEW INCORPORATION, MULTIPLE INCORPORATION, AND THE CONFLICT OF LAWS * W ITH a realization that in no other subject do erroneous fun- damental conceptions play greater havoc, the restaters of conflict of laws for the American Law Institute prefaced what is probably the first thorough analysis of common law conflict of laws problems involving corporations, with an interesting and extremely valuable discussion of corporate theory.' Through- out the development of the common law, a myriad of other theories have been advanced by jurists concerning the nature of incorporated entities, of corporate action, and of corporate property and obligations. Almost all of these analyses have pos- sessed the common defect of being largely a prior and of little or no practical assistance in dealing with actual legal problems. The theory advanced by the restaters, however, is substantially sound and can, better than any other known to the writer, meet the test of the decisions as well as of reason and utility.2 It is our purpose in this paper to analyze certain important corporate conflict problems which have heretofore rarely been dis- cussed in treatises or articles. For the sake of clarity, these prob- lems will be considered under three general heads: (i) meetings; (2) ultra vires action; and (3) property and obligations of singly and multiply incorporated associations. Moreover, there will be outlined a theory as to the nature of incorporation, incorporated entities, so-called corporate action, and corporate property and obligations, very similar to that set forth in the Restatement of Conflict of Laws. The considerations which should lead to the acceptance of this analysis will be indicated, and its practical application to the problems discussed will be demonstrated.

SINGLE AND MULTIPLE INCORPORATION Although in modern times many theories as to the nature of incorporation and of incorporated associations3 have been ad- vanced, mainly three have predominated. These may for con- venience be called respectively the fiction, the non-entity, and the real theories. The advocates of the fiction theory maintain that an incorporated association has no real existence, but that the law, by a dogmatic fiction, treats an association, when incorporated, as though it were an existing entity and attributes to this fictitious being legal rights and duties. The proponents of what we have termed the non-entity theory, on the other hand, are not interested in the question of whether or not an association is a reality. Ac- cording to their conception, only human beings can have rights and duties, and where an association is incorporated, rights and duties are in the human beings who are its members, although as a matter of convenience, they are spoken of as being in the incorporated entity. Finally, the realists insist that an association is a reality and that, when incorporated, it can and does have rights and duties and that incorporation is merely the recognition by the state of this fact. The conception of an incorporated association as a fictitious entity has been widely accepted, and the fiction theory may fairly be called the orthodox American common law theory.4 It is sub- mitted, however, that it cannot be accepted. It is irreconcilable 3 The term " incorporated association " as used in this article means a de facto entity which has been incorporated; that is, which has had legal personality con- ferred upon it. See pp. 5I8, infra. This legal personality is referred to in the article as the " corporation." See pp. 519-20, infra. The term " corporation " in common usage, however, is applied to both the association and its legal personality indis- criminately, but for our purposes a distinction in terms is necessary. 4 This theory was accepted in the common law largely through canon law in- fluences. See Dewey, The Historic Background of Corporate Legal Personality (1926) 35 YALE L. J. 655, 665. It was welcomed in the early American common law probably because it was perceived to be an excellent weapon to keep in re- straint these then unpopular entities.</page><page sequence="3">5I8 HARVARD LAW REVIEW with many of the decisions to be considered later and, when ap- plied, has led to arbitrary and undesirable results.5 The non- entity view has received little judicial recognition, considerable judicial discouragement, and rests on the misconception that only human beings can have legal rights and duties.6 The analysis of the realists, however, contains the germ from which may be de- veloped a sound corporate theory.7 The truth of the matter is that incorporated associations are not fictitious entities. Business associations are no figments of the imagination.8 They are entities having an existence and reality quite apart from law.9 Associations antedate law, and would continue to exist even if all legal sanction should cease. But while they are real, and not fictional or law created entities, they cannot, any more than human beings, enter into legal relations unless enabled to do so by law. Just as it is impossible for a human being to enter into legal relations with his fellow creatures without law created capacity, so also is it impossible for an asso- 5 For an excellent discussion, see HENDERSON, THE POSITION OF FOREIGN COR- PORATIONS IN AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW (i9i8) C. I. 6 The main exponent of this theory on the continent was Jhering. See 3 JHERING, GEIST DES R6MISCHEN RECHTS (i888) 356. Its chief American advocate was Hohfeld.

The term association as herein used, unless the context excludes it, includes businesses and offices.</page><page sequence="4">MULTIPLE INCORPORATION AND CONFLICT OF LAWS 5I9 ciation to do so. This law created capacity to enter into legal relations is known as legal personality, and the entity upon which the law confers such legal personality is known as a legal person. Thus, an incorporated association is a real entity, other than a human being, upon which the law has conferred legal personality, and incorporation is the process of conferring legal personality. This legal personality may be compared with the senses of a hu- man being. For it is to an entity in its legal relations what senses are to a human being in his social relations. An individual comes into contact with the outside world only through his physical senses and, if deprived from birth of all senses, necessarily can have no knowledge of the outside world. Similarly, a human being or other entity establishes legal contact with the outside world only through its legal senses - its legal personality. Incorporation, then, is the means of getting the actually existing entity, the asso- ciation, into legal relations with others. Any state or any number of states may incorporate an associa- tion without regard to the place of its activity or the domicil of its members.'0 By asking for incorporation the members submit the association to the control of the state or states asked, and such state or states thereby obtain jurisdiction to incorporate. Once incorporated, the association's legal personality will be recognized in other states; " for the conferring of legal personality on an association is the conferring of a status which like any other status will be recognized abroad.'2 Where several states incorporate the same association, that body has several legal personalities, or as might be said, several legal senses.'3 The question then arises as to whether there is one or 10 In the case of re-incorporation, consent of the original state is unnecessary. See Clark v. Barnard, IO8 U. S. 436, 451-52 (1883). But see St. Louis &amp; San Fran. Ry. v. James, i6i U. S. 545, 562 (i896). It should be noted that the question of whether the common law may confer legal personality on associations or whether this can be done only by legislation is not considered in this paper. See the dis- cussion in WARREN, CORPORATE ADVANTAGES WITHOUT INCORPORATION (I929) 7 et seq. 11 Bank of Augusta v. Earle, I3 Pet. 519 (U. S. 1839). 12 But see Cleveland, Status in Common Law (1925) 38 HARv. L. REV. 1074, 1084. 13 Multiple incorporation goes back to Colonial days. See WALLACE, CENTURY OF BENEFICENCE (1870) passim; HENDERSON, op. cit. supra note 5, at 28; 2 DAVIS, ESSAYS IN EARLIER HISTORY OF AMERICAN CORPORATIONS (1917) 30, I36-37, I40-4I.</page><page sequence="5">520 HARVARD LAW REVIEW more corporations. The answer obviously turns on the meaning given the term " corporation." When an association is incor- porated in but one state, the incorporated association is known simply as a corporation and no attempt is made to ascertain whether the term " corporation " is strictly to be applied to the association or to its legal personality. It is submitted that the corporation is the personality of the association. It is its legal sense - the instrumentality by which the association comes into contact with the outside world. This personality is purely the creature of the law. It differs from the association which, as has been seen, exists entirely independent of any legal sanction. Where there is more than one conferring of personality, that is, multiple incorporation, logically there is more than one corpora- tion. The language of the cases clearly supports this view,'4 and since it is merely a question of definition, it seems unwise to at- tempt to establish a new terminology. It does not follow, however, that the law should blind itself to the fact that even though there may be multiple incorporation, there is in reality only one associa- tion, and a body incorporated by two or more states must not be treated as though it were a partnership of two or more associations. The same association is the subject of the various incorporations. There is but one entity in existence, but one organization. To treat the association as a number of separate though closely united bodies, would be to disregard the actual situation and invert the view of the business world. MEETINGS OF SINGLY AND MULTIPLY INCORPORATED ASSOCIATIONS Before dealing with decisions concerning corporate meetings, it seems well to pause a moment to consider briefly the nature of so- 14 See, e.g., Nashua R.

W. 300, 30I (I899);</page><page sequence="6">MULTIPLE INCORPORATION AND CONFLICT OF LAWS 521 called corporate action. The theories advanced follow two main trends: (i) those resting on the presupposition that associations act, and that their action is just as real as is the activity of human beings; and (2) those resting on the presupposition that associa- tions do not act, but that human beings alone do, and that the law, under certain circumstances, empowers certain human beings to act for the association. Of these the former is the more recent and is a development from the doctrine of the realists that incorporated entities have a real existence. Those who adopt this theory of cor- porate activity speak of a group will as distinct from the wills of the members and consider that an association acts " through its or- gans " in just as real a sense as a human being acts through his."5 Such anthropomorphism is objectionable, and when it is applied to common law cases, numerous difficulties are encountered. Not only is it impossible to explain existing conflict of laws decisions on such a theory, but other difficulties arise from its application. If an association really acts, the question at once arises as to when it acts. Does such action occur when the directors act, or only when the members act? In view of the language in the decisions to the effect that directors are " agents " of the association," it is clear that the common law does not adopt the first of these views. If an association acts when the members act, what members must act? Suppose, for example, preferred stockholders in an incor- porated association have no voting power, is a vote of the common stockholders alone action by the association? If only a small per- centage of common stockholders have voting power, can a vote of such stockholders be properly termed action by the association? Is it not utterly fictitious to say that it is, and if action by a limited number of stockholders is action by the association, why is not directorate action sufficient? While we frequently find it stated that incorporated associations act and there is much talk in treatises and cases of " corporate action," such language is not intended to be taken literally.

When Henry Ford is said to have put a new car on the market, no one thinks that this is to be taken literally any more than when one talks about " a ship sailing away " or " a door opening." Such figures of speech are permis- sible, but they are only methods of description and are not in- tended as accurate representations of the situation. In reality, associations, incorporated or unincorporated, do not act, and hence cannot, without something more than legal person- ality, enter into legal relations. Someone who can act must first be designated to do so on behalf of the association. Accordingly, whenever a state incorporates, it confers on certain human beings the power to enter into legal relations on behalf of the association. This power is conferred by the common law on the members in meeting assembled."7 This power to act for the association can only be exercised in a state of charter because powers conferred by law can only be exercised where that law has force. It follows that an organiza- tion meeting 18 and all other stockholders' meetings,"9 except as 17 See BEALE, FOREIGN CORPORATIONS (1904); I BL.

R., 20 Ind. 492 (i863); American Clearing Co. v. Walkill Stock Farms Co., 293 Fed. 58 (S. D. Fla. 1923). The common law rule as to meetings (other than organization meetings) very probably is due to the policy of protecting stockholders, supported by a theory that a corporation, being merely a legal fiction, could only exist within the borders of the state whose law created it, and that a stockholders' meeting was a meeting of the corporation. It should be noted, however, that it does not follow necessarily from the fact that stockholder meetings outside a charter state are forbidden, that action at such meetings will have no legal significance. Collateral attack may be denied. Ellsworth v. Nat. Home &amp; Town Builders, 33 Cal. App. I, I64 Pac. I4 (1917); Ohio &amp; Miss. R. R. v. McPherson, 35 Mo. I (I864); Wright v. Lee, 2 S. D. 596 (I892); see Humphreys v. Mooney, 5 Colo. 282 (I880). These latter cases are sustainable on the ground that the state of charter did not put meetings out-</page><page sequence="8">MULTIPLE INCORPORATION AND CONFLICT OF LAWS 523 hereinafter explained, must be held in a state' of charter. At an organization meeting those possessing the corporate powers elect agents,20 usually known as directors, and these agents are author- ized to choose employees and conduct the ordinary affairs of the business. But until those upon whom the corporate powers are conferred, that is, the stockholders, act, the association cannot enter into legal relations. When, however, the members of an incorporated association exercise their power to act for the association by appointing other human beings, ordinarily directors, to carry on the business, these individuals may act anywhere.2' If they act outside a state of incorporation, they may bind the association, for their action has been caused by those human beings empowered by law to bind the association.22 While the stockholders who have the corporate powers may not exercise those powers outside the state, there is nothing in the nature of things to prevent their making themselves agents to act for the association outside. In such a case their position would be very similar to that of directors. But if a state of charter does not empower stockholders to meet outside,23 they side the state beyond the capacity of the association, but merely beyond its author- ity. Cf. In re Wilson's Estate, 85 Ore. 604, i67 Pac. 580 (I9I7) ; Thompson v. Natchez Water Co., 68 Miss. 423, 9 So. 82I (i890); American Clearing Co. v. Walkill Stock Farms Co., 293 Fed. 58 (S. D. Fla.

Thus it is probably the common law that certain charitable associations may hold other than organization meetings outside the charter state where they have a widely scattered membership and where it is contemplated in organizing the company that this may be done.

Also where all the stockholders consent, it is probable that the common law permits other than organization meetings to be held outside a charter state. Webb &amp; Co. v. Midway Lumber Co., 68 Mo. App. 546 (I897);</page><page sequence="9">524 HARVARD LAW REVIEW cannot appoint themselves such agents.24 Where, however, the state consents to meetings beyond its borders, such meetings may validly be held.25 In the case of an association incorporated by more than one state, each incorporating state empowers the members to act for the association, and a meeting may be held in any charter state,26 for organization 27 or any other purpose. Other charter states may Missouri Lead, etc. Co. v. Reinhard, supra note i9; and see Handley v. Stutz, I39 U. S. 417 (i89i). 24 See cases cited supra note i9. 25 See BEALE, FOREIGN CORPORATIONS (I904) ?? 322-23; George v. Holstein- Friesian Ass'n, supra note 23; Sovereign Camp v. Fraley, 94 Tex. 200, 59 S. W. 879 (i900). The authorities do not indicate the manner in which such meetings shall be called and held. Consent by the charter state to meetings outside the state may be construed as consent to meetings called and held in the manner re- quired by the law of the state where the meeting is held, unless consent is given by a statute with contrary controlling language. There is, however, some question as to whether a charter state can effectively consent to organization meetings outside a charter state. There is no authority in point but it is submitted that, where the state of charter authorized such meetings outside the state, those meetings are valid. This is not because the law of the state of charter has extra-territorial force but because under these circumstances the charter state submits the association to the jurisdiction of the state of act and the law of that state can impose an obligation on the association for acts done or caused by the stockholders in such meeting. There is no authority directly on this, but see George v. Holstein-Friesian Ass'n, supra note 23; and cf. Embericos v. Anglo- Austrian Bank, [I904] 2 K. B. 870. Those cases which hold stockholder acquies- cence is corporate action tend to support this view. Even if this theory is not accepted, there is another ground for holding the action as binding on the associa- tion. This is that the state of charter may impose an obligation on the association for an act it authorized abroad, not because the charter state laws have opera- tion outside the state, but because the charter state has jurisdiction over the incor- porated association. Compare the cases of stockholders' liability for corporate debts imposed by the charter state -regardless of the place where the debt was created. 26 Graham v. Boston, etc. R. R., ii8 U. S. i6i (i886); Pollitz v. Wabash R. R., i67 Fed. I45, I56 (S. D. N. Y. i909); Bridge Co. v. Mayer, 3I Ohio St. 3I7, 325 (I877); Ohio &amp; Miss. Ry. v. People, I23 Ill. 467, I4 N.

There are two main functions of an organization meeting: (i) acceptance of the charter, and (2) election of officers and authorization of business. Formal acceptance of the charter is usually unnecessary, and where multiple incorporation is in the form of re- incorporation, or rechartering, rather than consolidation, no election of officers or authorization of business is required and consequently an organization meeting is usually unnecessary. In such cases the old organization continues. See Louisville Trust Co. v. Louisville, etc. R. R., 7, Fed. 433, 443 (C. C. A. 6th, I896). In cases of interstate consolidation an organization meeting may be necessary because there is a new association involving the necessity of an election and authorization.</page><page sequence="10">MULTIPLE INCORPORATION AND CONFLICT OF LAWS 525 not complain. Where the meeting of a multiply incorporated body is held in a charter state, the law of that state determines how the meeting shall be called and conducted, the legality of a vote by proxy, the number necessary for a quorum, and the like. For the members are exercising a power given by the law of the state of meeting.28 ULTRA VIRES ACTS OF SINGLY AND MULTIPLY INCORPORATED ASSOCIATIONS A sound analysis of ultra vires conflict of law cases presupposes a sound analysis of jurisdictional problems. Just as no state can, by a judgment or decree, create a binding obligation on one not subject to the jurisdiction of its courts, it may not by its common law or statutes impose an obligation on individuals or other en- tities unless they are subject to the law of that state. Conse- quently, before we can say that the directors or agents of an incor- porated association can bind the association by acts, authorized or unauthorized, done outside a state of charter, we must discover whether the state where the acts were done had jurisdiction to impose an obligation. At common law, a state has jurisdiction over those present or domiciled 29 within its borders, over those consenting to its juris- diction,30 and over those subjecting themselves to its law.31 If 28 " The Boston and Maine Railroad being a Massachusetts corporation, voting by proxy at a meeting of its stockholders held here in accordance with Massachu- setts law was binding upon the corporation. Even if it be assumed that the law of New Hampshire, within which State the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad also was in- corporated, was different in respect of permitting voting by proxy at the meeting of the stockholders, . . . the stockholders' meeting held in Massachusetts and con- ducted according to its law was lawful."

For the purpose of this paper, we shall assume that a state has jurisdiction to impose an obligation on an individual or other entity when there is such a relation between that entity and the state, that the state may, in accordance with common law principles, impose an obligation, and that, when imposed, this obligation (unless</page><page sequence="11">526 HARVARD LAW REVIEW none of these conditions exists in a particular case, the state may not impose an obligation on either an individual or other entity.32 For present purposes, we are interested only in jurisdiction over incorporated associations and shall confine our inquiry as far as possible to this problem. As an incorporated association is pres- ent nowhere, in any real sense of the term, and as it is domiciled only in a state of charter, jurisdiction of a non-charter state can be based only on consent or subjection. It is doubtful whether an association commonly consents to the imposition of obligations upon it by a foreign state except insofar as this is included in its consent to the jurisdiction of the courts of the state, a problem with which we are not here concerned. Thus the only important jurisdictional question remaining is to determine what constitutes subjection. One causing an event to occur 3 subjects himself to the jurisdic- tion of the state where in fact the event occurs, and that state may impose an obligation upon him.34 If A causes B to do an act 3 penal) will be recognized in other common law states. When such a relation exists, a state may be said to have jurisdiction to impose that obligation. CONFLICT OF LAWS RESTATEMENT (Am. L. Inst. I926) ? 43 et seq. Consequently, cases involv- ing the jurisdiction of courts, although analogous, will not be dealt with here; and the cases to be cited involve the creation of rights by other than judicial bodies. No attempt will be made here to ascertain whether the term " jurisdiction " more properly describes the circumstances in which the state may validly act, or whether it gives a reason for valid state action. 32 Hill v.

It has been suggested that certain cases involving the liability of stockholders of foreign corporations show that, where there is no reference to a particular state by those authorizing an act, the state where the act was done has no jurisdiction to impose an obligation for the act on the one au- thorizing it unless some other ground of jurisdiction is present. These cases do not support this proposition. They hold merely that a stockholder in a corpora- tion formed expressly to do business in a foreign state is liable to corporate credi- tors on contracts there made, if the law of that state so provides. Pinney v. Nelson, I83 U. S. I44, I5I (I9OI); Thomas v. Matthiessen, 232 U. S. 22I (I9I4). It does not follow that an obligation could not be imposed on a stockholder where the corporate charter does not refer to the particular foreign state seeking to im- pose liability. The Supreme Court in Thomas v. Matthiessen expressly left the matter open, and there is one state decision holding that despite the lack of a specific reference the state has jurisdiction. Provident Gold Mining Co. v. Haynes, I73 Cal. 44, 159 Pac. I55 (I9I6). The English court has held in Risdon Iron &amp; Locomotive Works v. Furness, LI905] I K. B. 304, [i906] I K. fl. 49, that where the articles of association provided for no individual liability, and authorized doing of business in foreign states, such authorization permitted business to be done only in states where freedom from individual liability was possible. In other words, the court found the contract made by the corporate officers to be unauthorized. This case is not an authority for the proposition that an authorization must refer to</page><page sequence="13">528 HARVARD LAW REVIEW B a note to negotiate, telling him to transfer it in any state he chooses. B transfers the note in state Y. A is subject to liability by the law of state Y. This would likewise be true if A gave the note to B without any instruction as to where he should transfer it, unless, on a proper construction of the authorization by A, B was not in fact intended to be able to negotiate the note in the state where he did. Unhappily the Conflict of Laws Restatement by the American Law Institute casts some doubt on this proposition. Section 74 of the restatement reads: " If a person neither authorizes nor ratifies an act done on his behalf in another state, he cannot be made liable for the act by the law of that state, since he has not caused it by any act of his." 3 The comment on this section is as follows: " The necessity of consent by the principal to the jurisdiction of the state where the act is done cannot be satisfied by anything less than con- sent, no matter what may be the law of that state. Though the law of that state makes a person liable as principal for any act within the appar- ent scope of the agent's authority, there being no consent to the act, the principal cannot be held liable." 40 Section 74 is unimpeachable. The same may be said of the second sentence of the comment. The first sentence of the com- ment, however, is objectionable in that it implies a necessity of consent to the jurisdiction of the state of the act before that state can have jurisdiction. If this is so, then the causing of an event in state X would not be sufficient to give that state jurisdiction over the absent party who caused the act, unless the latter made at least some reference to state X. Causation, however, is quite enough to give the state where an act is done jurisdiction, without the necessity of any such reference. Specific consent to the juris- diction of the state of the act is unnecessary.4' the specific state seeking to impose liability - but merely that when there is no specific state referred to and the articles of association expressly provide against individual liability, persons becoming members do not assent to the doing of business in a state imposing individual liability. 39 CONFLICT OF LAWS RESTATEMENT (Am.

See supra notes 34 and 38.</page><page sequence="14">MULTIPLE INCORPORATION AND CONFLICT OF LAWS 529 This matter is not one merely of general interest, but has an important bearing on our problem. If the stockholders of the X railroad authorize the directors to carry on business, and the directors act outside the state, there can be no doubt that they can and should be able to bind the association, even though the stock- holders did not refer expressly to any particular state. Any other rule would be most unfortunate. Where P, a principal in state X, authorizes an agent to do a particular act outside the state and the agent does some other act, can the state where the act was done impose an obligation on P? In this situation, the act done was not caused by P, and merely authorizing or sending an agent into a state is not a subjection to liability for unauthorized acts of such agent. Unless, then, some other basis for jurisdiction is present, P cannot be bound regard- less of what the law of the second state may be.42 This is true a fortiori where, though not authorized to act in state X, the agent does act in that state.43 Subsequent ratification by the principal will, of course, give the state of the act jurisdiction. Furthermore, where P carries on business in a state through agents, it is sub- mitted that he subjects himself to the agency laws of that state as to acts done in the course of such business. Accordingly, the second state has jurisdiction to impose on P liability for any act done by his agents in the course of this business although not in fact caused by him.44 42 Lloyd v.

The limits of this doctrine have not been worked out, but this limit at least seems established: doing business in a foreign state is not a submission to the laws of that state as to acts done on behalf of an association which are beyond its corporate capacity. See cases cited in note 50, infra.</page><page sequence="15">530 HARVARD LAW REVIEW A state thus has jurisdiction to impose an obligation on an entity for events, including acts, caused by that entity" within its borders, and also for acts not so caused but done on behalf of that entity in the course of business which was authorized.46 With these principles in mind, we may proceed to a consideration of ultra vires acts. A. Ultra Vires Acts of Singly Incorporated Associations Where an act is done in a non-charter state on behalf of an incorporated association, three questions arise for determination. The first is a question of jurisdiction. Can the state where the act is done impose an obligation on the association because of it? The second may, for want of a better name, be called a question of agency. Have the proper human beings acted? This question re- quires a consideration of what law or laws determine who are the proper human beings to act, and, this having been found, the further question of whether under the law or laws controlling, the proper persons have acted. The third question is that of ultra vires 47 and necessitates finding what law determines whether an act done on behalf of an association is ultra vires, and what law determines the effect which shall be given to such an act. We have already considered the principles governing jurisdic- tion, and it but remains to apply these principles to this situation. If the act in question is beyond the corporate capacity of the as- sociation as determined by the law of the state of charter, that is, if the act is one no human beings have been empowered to do on behalf of the association,48 the non-charter state where the act is 45 In the case of an incorporated association, as we have seen, the causation here referred to must be by those human beings empowered by the charter law to act for the association. See pp. 522-23, and note 33, supra. 46 This latter statement is subject to the limitation indicated in note 44, supra. 47 See Stevens, A Proposal as to the Codification and Restatement of the Ultra Tires Doctrine (I927) 36 YALE L.

REV. 623. 48 For the distinction between ultra vires acts which are beyond the corporate capacity and those merely beyond the corporate authority, see Warren, supra</page><page sequence="16">MULTIPLE INCORPORATION AND CONFLICT OF LAWS 53I done has no jurisdiction to affect the association on account of it. For jurisdiction cannot be based here on causation as the act in question has not been caused by anyone empowered to act for the association, and it cannot be based on the conducting business in the state where the act was done because, as we have seen, merely carrying on an intra vires business does not amount to a subjec- tion for such ultra vires acts.49 Thus, suppose that the stock- holders of the A railroad company, incorporated in state X, meet there and authorize the directors to purchase and operate a mine in state Y, and to send B, an agent, to make the arrangements. B, in state Y, contracts, on behalf of the association, to buy the mine. If by the law of the state X, where the stockholders met, the action taken by them was beyond the corporate capacity, then the asso- ciation is not liable on the contract. The same result would ob- viously be reached where there is no stockholder action.50 On the other hand, if by the law of the charter state the act in question is not beyond the corporate capacity but is merely unau- thorized by that law,5' then the state where the act is done has jurisdiction, because the act is caused, though wrongfully, by those empowered to affect the association. In the absence of action by those in whom the corporate powers are vested, namely the stock- holders, the second state acquires no jurisdiction because of the act, unless the association was carrying on business in the state and the act was in the course of such business. If, in the case put, there had been no stockholder action, but the directors alone had sent B into state Y to contract for a mine, and such action was note 47. An act is beyond the corporate capacity by the law of the charter state when that law does not empower human beings to do it for the association. 49 See-note 48, supra and cases cited in note 50, infra. 50 See Orr v. Lacey, 2 Doug. 230, 235 (Mich. i846), where it was said, "the Courts of this state will examine into the capacity of the bank to make a contract, and, if it discovers a want of capacity to make the one on which a recovery is sought, they will not carry it into effect." See Hitchcock v. U. S. Bank, 7 Ala. 386, 434, 443 (i845); Anglo-Am. Land, etc. Co. v. Lombard, 132 Fed. 721 (C. C. A. 8th, 1904); Starkweather v. Am. Bible Soc., 72 Ill. 50 (i874). See also Black v. Del. &amp; Raritan Canal Co., 22 N. J. Eq. 130, 422 (i87i), where the court said, "The capacity of such foreign corporation to hold property or transact business, depends upon the law of the state which created it." 51 An " unauthorized act " is one which human beings are empowered to do on behalf of the association, but which not being authorized is impliedly, at least, forbidden. Not every act which is unauthorized is beyond the corporate capacity. Eastern Bldg., etc. Ass'n v. Williamson, 189 U. S. 122 (1903).</page><page sequence="17">532 HARVARD LAW REVIEW ultra vires by the law of the charter state, then state Y cannot im- pose a liability on the association because of the contract. But if the A railroad company was doing business in state Y and the purchase of a mine can properly be considered as incidental to railroading, then state Y has jurisdiction to bind the association. The determination that the foreign state has jurisdiction does not, however, settle the matter whether it will or should exercise its jurisdiction and bind the association. Whether it will impose an obligation, and to what extent, are matters to be determined by its own law and in accordance with its interpretation of com- mon law principles. This brings us to the second question, which we have termed an agency problem. Even though a state has jurisdiction over an entity, it imposes liability for acts done in behalf of the entity, whether human or incorporated, only on principles of agency law. In other words, before a state imposes an obligation on the association because of an act done there on behalf of the association, it must determine whether or not in accordance with its law the proper human beings have acted. Thus a state having jurisdiction over an incorporated association, should not, as a matter of common law, impose liability unless either the act was caused by the human beings possessing under the law of the charter state the corporate powers, or else unless by its own law, the act was within the scope of the authority of the individuals who have acted.52 By way of illustration, suppose that A, an officer of a company incorporated in state X, executes and delivers to bankers in state Y an issue of bonds. Assuming that state Y has jurisdiction, it should not bind the association unless A's act was authorized by the stockholders, or, even though not so authorized, the act was within the so-called scope of author- ity of A under the law of state Y. For instance, A may have been authorized by the directors to execute the bonds in question and 52 The phrase "scope of the authority" is used here in the sense of legal, though not necessarily actual, authority. The question is discussed in Stevens, suprc note 47. Directors have a wider scope of action that may be said to be " within the scope of their authority " than other agents usually have, and probably, wider also than Mr. Stevens indicates in the above cited article. The term ' agency " as used in this article includes also the relationship between the directors and the association; and within the term " agency laws " is included not merely the laws governing agents over whom a power of control is reserved, but agents in the wider sense of those acting on behalf of another.</page><page sequence="18">MULTIPLE INCORPORATION AND CONFLICT OF LAWS 533 by the law of state Y it was within the scope of the directors' au- thority to order such an issue. When it is ascertained that the state in which the act was done has jurisdiction and that by its own law the proper human beings have caused the act, one more question remains, namely, whether the act was ultra vires and if so what effect shall be given to it. The state where the act was done should look to the charter state to ascertain whether or not the act in question was authorized.53 If authorized by the charter state and not forbidden by the law of the state of act, legal significance should be given to the act. If, however, the act in question is found to have been unauthorized by the charter state, the reason for this should be determined. Where the act was unauthorized because beyond the purposes of the association 5 or because it violates a restriction imposed by the charter state for the protection of creditors and stockholders,55 the lack of authority is not purely a matter of local concern to the charter state. In such a situation the interests of the creditors and stockholders involved should lead the foreign state to treat the act as it would an ultra vires act on behalf of one of its own incorporated associations. On the other hand, if the act in ques- tion in unauthorized by the charter state because of a purely local 53 Sherwood v. Alvis, 83 Ala. II5, 3 So. 307 (i887); Tolman v. New Mexico &amp; Dak.

B. Ultra Vires Acts of Multiply Incorporated Associations When an act is done on behalf of a multiply incorporated asso- ciation, the same three questions arise for consideration as arose in the case of a singly incorporated body. But here we have an additional problem, namely, how under the controlling law the determination whether a particular act is or is not ultra vires is to be made. This latter is not a conflict of laws problem, but it is so intimately bound up with the other questions, that a proper understanding of many of the cases requires its consideration. Turning first to jurisdiction, when an act is done on behalf of a multiply incorporated association in any one of the charter states, the association, being domiciled there,5 is clearly subject to the law of that state. When the act is done outside any of the charter states, the state where the act is done has jurisdiction to affect the association only if the particular act was caused by those human beings empowered by the law of some charter state to act for the association, or the association is carrying on business in the state and the act in question was done in the course of that business and was within the corporate capacity of the association by the law of some charter state.58 Assuming, however, that the state, whether it be a charter or non-charter state, has jurisdiction on some one of the grounds dis- cussed, it should apply its own law 59 to the situation and determine whether under principles of what we have called its agency law 6 the association should be bound. No obligation should be im- posed because of the act done unless it was caused by those human beings empowered to act for the association by the law of some 56 Hitchcock v. U. S. Bank, 7 Ala. 386 (1845); Ellsworth v. St. Louis, etc. R. R., 98 N. Y. 553, 55g (x885); Whitman Mining Co. v. Baker, 3 Nev. 386 (i867); see Milnor v. N. Y. &amp; N. H. R. R., 53 N.

To illustrate, suppose that A, an officer of a railroad company incorporated in states X, Y, and Z, executes and delivers to bankers in state X an issue of bonds. The stockholders may have met in a charter state and, exercising powers given by that law, have authorized the directors to provide for an issue of bonds, and the directors may have caused A to issue them. In such a case, the act in state X was caused by those in whom the corporate powers were vested, and consequently the association may be bound. Even though the stockholders have failed not only to authorize the issue, but have expressly forbidden it, if the directors have authorized the issue and have also authorized A's execution of the bonds, and by the law of state X it is within the scope of their authority to do so, then the issue will likewise be valid.6' Having determined that the state has jurisdiction and that in accordance with what may be called its agency law it is proper for it to exercise this jurisdiction, we are confronted with the prob- lem of ultra vires. When an act is done in another charter state, we have to consider whether the state where the act was done should, if it considers the act intra vires under its own law, take into account the fact that it is ultra vires under the law of some other charter state.62 Moreover, if it is determined that the act 61 An interesting point for consideration arises. Suppose that states X and Y are charter states, and that by the law of state Y, a particular bond issue is beyond the corporate capacity of the association, but by the law of state X it is not when authorized by a majority of the stockholders. If a majority of the stockholders meeting in state Y vote for the issue and the directors, in pursuance of an author- ization at the meeting, cause A to do the act in state X, where it is authorized, the question arises as to whether state X can, in accordance with common law agency principles considered above, bind the association. It is arguable that those em- powered to bind the association did not cause the particular act, and that those who did cause it, namely the directors, were not acting within their authority, because their authority was only to do this when there was valid stockholder action. The answer would seem to be that the act was caused by those human beings, namely, the majority stockholders, who the state where the act was done said could bind the association. While they were not in the strict sense empowered by law to act, the question is one of agency not jurisdiction; and there being no sufficient justification in policy for a distinction between cases where majority stockholders meet in one state rather than another, the fact that the act was caused at a meeting in state Y, where that act was not within corporate capacity, should not be material. 62 Or, similarly, if it considers the act ultra vires under its own law, whether it</page><page sequence="21">536 HARVARD LAW REVIEW is ultra vires, we must discover what law governs the consequences of the act. It is submitted that if the act is done in a charter state, and that state finds the act ultra vires or intra vires by its own law, it should apply that law and not consider the law of other charter states. If it determines that the act is ultra vires, it should give to that act the same consequences it gives to ultra vires acts of other associations incorporated by it.63 Once the charter state has determined what its law is, there is no reason why it should not apply it. In other words, as we shall see, it is proper for a charter state to consider the fact that the association is incor- porated in several states when it is determining whether or not a particular act should be deemed objectionable as being ultra vires. But having determined that it is objectionable, the fact that an- other charter state considers it unobjectionable should then be immaterial. To illustrate the point just considered, suppose that a railroad is incorporated in states X, Y, and Z, and that by the law of X a purchase of the controlling interest in a steamship company was valid, but by the law of Y it was beyond the corporate authority, and by the law of Z, beyond the corporate capacity.65 The stock- holders meet in state Y, where the purchase is beyond the corpo- rate authority, and authorize A to make a contract of purchase in any one of the states. If A makes the contract in state X, where the purchase is intra vires, liability on the contract should be im- posed; if made in Y, where the purchase is beyond the corporate authority, the contract is ultra vires; if made in Z, where it is beyond the corporate capacity, the contract is void.66 And the result should be the same if the stockholders met in state X or state Z.67 Moreover, a like decision should be reached where there should take into account the fact that it is intra vires under the law of some other charter state. The factors which should, in the absence of controlling legislation, lead it to determine whether or not the act was ultra vires or intra vires will be considered below.

In the latter case, the act is so contrary to the policy of that state that an obligation created as a result of it should not be enforced there.70 Stock issues by multiply incorporated associations present prob- lems which deserve separate consideration, although the govern- ing principles have already been stated. Stock represents mem- bership in an association which has been incorporated. The nature of stock is the same no matter how many incorporations there may be. It is still, in essence, membership in an association; and there being only one association, there can only be one mem- bership. Where an issue of stock by an association with multiple personalities complies with the laws of all charter states, it is, of course, valid.7' If all laws are not complied with, however, the issue is ultra vires and may be enjoined.72 Thus it has been held, that, where by the law of one charter state unanimous consent of the stockholders was necessary to authorize a stock issue, a major- ity vote was not enough, though cast at a meeting in another charter state where it was held to be sufficient.73 This is because no one can have membership in an association which has been 68 Similar principles govern transfers of title. The charter state where the property is, determines by its own law whether or not the transfer is ultra vires and the effect, if any, to be given to it. Pittsburgh &amp; St. Louis R. R.

But unless the issue is enjoined or by the law of one charter state is utterly void, the issue stands as though validly made.4 There is very little discussion in the cases concerning action on behalf of a multiply incorporated association in non-charter states. The results of the decisions themselves, however, indicate that when such an act is done in a non-charter state, that state having jurisdiction and the proper human beings having acted, if the action is intra vires by the law of any charter state, it will be treated as intra vires by the foreign state.5 This seems sound; for the defense of ultra vires rests mainly upon the policy of pro- tecting stockholders and intra vires creditors, and such persons certainly must contemplate that the association will engage in acts authorized by any one of its charters. If, then, the association does an act outside any charter state but authorized by at least one charter state, the policy of protecting stockholders and intra vires creditors does not require that the action be considered in- valid merely because ultra vires by the law of another charter state. If, however, the action is ultra vires by the law of all the charter states, then the foreign state should treat the act as such and apply the rules governing similar ultra vires action of asso- ciations incorporated by it. Frequently a multiply incorporated association will be em- powered by one charter state to do what it is not only not empowered but expressly forbidden to do by another.76 It is obvi- ous, therefore, that an association incorporated in more than one state may become involved in some awkward legal situations. Suppose, for example, that the association exercises in one charter state a power there given but forbidden by another charter state. Though obligations may arise as a result of the act in the first state, the state forbidding the action may deprive the association 74 See Covington, etc. Bridge Co. v.

Such a construction is not without merit. Stock- holders may well be held not to consent to action which deprives them of so important a privilege as legal personality.78 Having discussed the proper bases for jurisdiction over a multiply incorporated association, the so-called principles of agency involved, and what is the proper law to determine whether or not a given act is ultra vires, we may now consider how under the proper law the determination whether a particular act is or is not ultra vires, is to be made. The powers of an incorporated asso- ciation are to be determined by interpreting the charter or incor- porating act in the light of common law principles. If there is a statute or decision on the question in the state whose law controls, no further search need be made. But frequently there will be no statute or decision exactly controlling or even implicitly covering the situation. In such a case it should be kept in mind that an association incorporated by more than one state need not be treated exactly like an association incorporated by only one. The differences in the factual situation may well call for different treat- ment. Thus if state X's law applies and by that law it is ultra vires for an association incorporated by that state alone to own stock in another company, it does not necessarily follow that it should be held ultra vires for a multiply incorporated association to do so. There are two main types of multiply incorporated associations, those created by the simultaneous and concurrent action of two or more states,79 and those incorporated first by one state, and then 77 It may, e.g., dissolve the corporation of that state. See in this connection i Op. Att'y Gen. ii8 (Mass. i894), and see Attorney General v. N. Y., N. H. &amp; H. R. R., i98 Mass. 413, 84 N. E. 737 (i908). 78 Of course, as we have seen, if such action is taken, it is valid and ultra vires may not be urged. Stockholders have adequate protection in the ability to secure an injunction. The risk of dissolution in a state forbidding, while perhaps adequate to justify an injunction, ought not to be deemed sufficient to allow collateral attack. The act, being authorized by the law where done, should be treated as valid. 79 I.e., action which one state takes in view of similar action taken by or to be taken by another state.</page><page sequence="25">540 HARVARD LAW REVIEW re-incorporated by another or others.80 Where an association is incorporated by the simultaneous but concerted action of two or more states, each state contemplates that the one factual entity is to function under the control of one or more sovereigns besides itself. Each charter state should then endeavor not unduly to hamper the association, and should recognize the fact that if an act which is intra vires in one state is ultra vires in another, the association is very seriously handicapped. For, as we have seen, while only one law applies as to the consequences of that act, in the sense of creating rights and duties because of it, the associa- tion may nevertheless forfeit its charter because an act, valid where done, was forbidden by another charter state, and such an act may conceivably be enjoined. Accordingly, a method of dealing with acts done on behalf of the association should be de- termined which will minimize friction, even where it cannot elimi- nate it; and each charter state should endeavor as far as pos- sible to work out a doctrine of ultra vires which will prevent an act being considered as unobjectionable by one charter state and objectionable by others. While the decisions have not fully worked out any definite rule, there is considerable support for the following view which, it is submitted, should be applied in the absence of a statute or con- trolling decision. If an act is done in a charter state on behalf of the association and such act is purely of local concern and does not seriously affect the association in other charter states, then that charter state should treat the act as it would the act of an association incorporated by it alone.8" Other charter states should treat the act in the same manner as the charter state in which it was done would treat it. If, however, the act is one which is of particular concern to some other charter state, then the state where the act is done should treat it as ultra or intra vires depending upon whether such act is or is not objectionable under the law of the state particularly affected. When the act is one 80 This is known as re-incorporation, rechartering, and domestication. The last term is sometimes used loosely to include instances where no new legal personality is conferred. 81 See i Op. Att'y Gen. ii8, 136-37 (Mass. i894); Attorney General v. Boston &amp; Maine R. R., io9 Mass. 99 (I87I); Clark v. Barnard, IO8 U. S. 436 (I883); Peters v. Boston &amp; Maine R. R., II4 Mass. 127 (1873).</page><page sequence="26">MULTIPLE INCORPORATION AND CONFLICT OF LAWS 541 which will affect the association in all charter states, then if the act is one which would be ultra vires by the law of any one of those states by a clear statutory provision or decision, or would be ultra vires if done by a singly incorporated association in any one of them, it should be treated as ultra vires,82 regardless of what the law of the charter state where the action occurs happens to be. To illustrate these suggested rules, suppose that large amounts of bonds are issued in state X, a charter state, and the money raised is to be spent for the benefit of the issuing railroad as a whole. The issue is ultra vires unless by the law of all charter states the action is intra vires either by statute or decision or be- cause it would be intra vires if done by an association incorporated in such states. On the other hand, suppose a railroad company wishes to issue notes of small amounts to pay for local improve- ments in state X and the notes are issued there. State X should not consider the attitude of other states in determining whether or not the issue is ultra vires, and if state X would hold the issue unobjectionable, other states should also do so.83 Where an association is incorporated by one state and later re- incorporated by another, the factual situation is slightly different. The original state need not consent to the re-incorporation,84 and it is difficult to say whether the same rules should be applicable as in the case of simultaneous incorporation by several states. It is submitted, however, that the policy of avoiding friction and con- sequent waste, and the desirability of one rule for both types of cases, should cause the adoption of the same rules for both. But one modification should be noted. Where a state re-incorporates an association already incorporated, it adopts the association with its existing organization. If the stock or membership is changed in compliance with the law of the original charter state, the change is valid in the state of re-incorporation unless the latter's 82 See Pollitz v. Public Utility Comm., 96 Ohio St. 49, II7 N. E. I49 (I917); Pollitz v. Wabash Ry., i67 App. Div. 669, I52 N. Y. Supp. 803 (I9I5); Continental Securities Co. v. N. Y. Cent. &amp; H. R. R., 2I7 N.

PROPERTY AND OBLIGATIONS OF SINGLY AND MULTIPLY INCORPORATED ASSOCIATIONS It is frequently said that a corporation owns property, has rights, and is subject to obligations. The statement is normally made with reference to single incorporation, and the term " cor- poration " is used to mean the singly incorporated association. When, however, we come to examine the cases involving multiple incorporation, it is clearly seen that this usage is not sufficiently precise. Accurately speaking, the corporation is the legal person- ality, the " legal sense," of the association, and property and other legal rights and duties are in the association, not in its personal- ity. There are, as we have stated, two main types of multiply incorporated associations -those incorporated by the independ- ent but concerted effort of two or more states, and those in- corporated by one state, and later re-incorporated by another. The most common class of the first type is that of interstate consolidations. Here two or more associations incorporated in different states unite into one, that one obtaining legal personality from each of the original incorporating states. On consolidation it is customary for the old associations to transfer all their prop- erty to the new.86 XWhen property is so transferred, or when new property is thereafter acquired, it belongs, properly speaking, to the association, and not to any one or all of the corporations.87 85 This would seem to follow from Louisville Trust Co. v. Louisville, etc. Ry., 75 Fed. 433, 434 (C. C. A. 6th, i896); see CONFtICT OF LAWS RESTATEMENT (Am. L. Inst. i927) ? 22i accord. 86 Atlantic Coast Line R. R. v. Cone, 53 Fla. IOI7, 43 SO. 5I4 (1907). Personal property may be transferred informally, but formality is necessary in the case of realty, in the absence of a special statutory provision on the matter. Many states, however, have statutes authorizing consolidation, which provide for the automatic passage of title on incorporation of the new association. See, e.g., ARIZ. Civ. CODE (19I3) ?? 2I57-63; CoLo. COMP. LAWS (I922) ? 2830; NEB. COMP. STAT. (I922) ? 5303; OHIo GEN. CODE (Page, I926) ? 9038; PA. STAT. (West, i920) ? I8592: S. C. CODE OF LAWS (I922) ? 4797; VA. GEN.

See Central</page><page sequence="28">MULTIPLE INCORPORATION AND CONFLICT OF LAWS 543 The traditional theory, however, is otherwise. Under that the- ory, if there is a consolidation, or a conveyance after consolida- tion, and the association is not described in the deed as a corpora- tion of any particular state or states, property in any charter state passes to the corporation created by that state, and property out- side any charter state is held by all the corporations jointly. Where the association is described in the deed as a corporation of one or more of the charter states, title passes to the corporation or corporations named. The theory that the property of the association is owned by a number of corporations must, it is believed, be rejected. While the authorities directly in point are meagre, such as exist are in- consistent with such a view, and practical considerations and analogies are clearly against it. In the case of In re Lyons Es- tate,88 it appeared that the testatrix had bequeathed property to a company incorporated in both Massachusetts and New York, de- scribing the Company as the "X Co. of Boston, Mass." The New York taxing authorities sought to impose a tax on the be- quest as a transfer to a foreign corporation. It was held that the transfer was not so taxable, the court saying: " Theoretically it may be said that there is a distinct legal entity in each of the three states, but the substance is the same in all. . . If the testatrix had distinctly said that she had intended the bequest to go to the New York corporation, it would have gone into the same treasury, and have been disbursed in the same manner and by the same people." 89 While it is settled law that no state may impose an excise on one legal entity measured by the property of another, the law is also well settled that where an association is incorporated in several states, any charter state may impose an excise on the association measured by all its property,90 and an inheritance tax may be im- posed on the shares by any charter state, such states not being confined in taxing to that proportion of the shares representing Trust Co. v.

Not only are these decisions inexplicable on the traditional theory, but that theory if logically applied would lead to results which no common law court would be willing to accept. Suppose, for example, that a large number of trucks are sent from the ship- ping rooms of the Boston and Maine Railroad in Massachusetts to the Maine shipping rooms of that company. The railroad is sued in Maine, and levy is had on this property. The Boston and Maine, alleging itself to be a Massachusetts corporation, sues for conversion, setting up that the property attached belonged to it and had merely been lent on a bailment at will to the Maine cor- poration. Clearly there should be no recovery. Suppose further that a concern, which we may call the A company, is incorporated in states X and Y, and personal property is deeded to it as a cor- poration of state X. Years later the A company, not knowing how it was deeded to it, sells it, describing itself as a corporation of state Y. Can it later attack the title as a corporation of state X? Such attack clearly should be denied. The association is a ,unit and should be so treated unless there is a juristic impossi- bility, and there is none in the view here suggested. The difficulty as to property ownership, created by the tradi- tional theory, is accentuated in the case of re-incorporated associa- tions. If the ownership of property is in the corporation, then when a new personality is conferred, how does the property get over into that new personality? As a matter of practice, convey- ances are not made in this type of case. Suppose that the A com- pany incorporated in state X does business and owns realty in state Y. Later it re-incorporates in Y. Formality is essential to pass title to real estate. If title is in the corporation created by state X, it has not passed out. Suppose no other property is owned or acquired in state Y, and that a tort is committed there. If suit is brought in state Y, legal execution would be impossible, for the corporation of state Y would on this theory be sued and that corporation has no property. 91 Welch v.

REV. 597.</page><page sequence="30">MULTIPLE INCORPORATION AND CONFLICT OF LAWS 545 All these problems are avoided, and the decisions considered above easily explained if the property is considered as being in the association, and it is submitted that this is the law. The A company incorporated in states X, Y, and Z, owns the property conveyed to it, just as much as John Smith owns property con- veyed to him. The property in neither case is in the entity's legal personality. Thus, in a conveyance by or to the association, no matter where the property is, or how the association describes it- self, or is described, the property passes from or to the association.92 The conclusion that property is in the association rather than in one or more of its personalities, is fortified by those decisions involving the enforcement of obligations of this type of associa- tion. There can be no doubt on the authorities that it is the asso- ciation that is bound, and not one or more of its personalities. For it is clear that no matter where a tort is committed, or con- tract is made, the resulting liability can be enforced against the association in any charter state,93 and that a judgment against the association in any charter state can be enforced in another charter state against the association as a corporation of that state.94 The traditional theory attempts to explain the contract and tort cases on the ground that contracts and torts outside any charter state are made or committed by all the corporations.

But while a tort or contract in a charter state is that of the corporation created by that state,95 all the other corporations are said to be liable as partners.96 The en- forceability of judgments against one corporation in suits against another is explained on the ground that a judgment against one corporation binds all because of privity. This theory is totally inadequate. First of all, the assumption that in each charter state the corporation of that state alone acts, and that in non-charter states all act, is purely fictitious and ignores the factual unity of the association. When an act is done in a charter state, the authority for doing the act is normally traceable " to a stockholders' meeting, and the stockholders ordi- narily authorize the carrying on of the business without reference to any particular incorporation. There is only one association, not several working together in close harmony.98 Not only is it fictitious to talk of the various corporations acting, but it is equally fictitious to talk of their being in a position analogous to that of partners. One might as well speak of a partnership of rights where one person has several rights. Nor on the partner- ship theory can we explain the fact that, while partners normally are only jointly liable on contracts, the so-called partnership liability of these corporations is joint and several. The hopelessness, however, of a partnership theory of liability is evident when rechartered companies are considered. To hold that rights and duties are in the corporation, rather than the asso- ciation, would result in holding that the association could not be sued in a recharter state as a corporation of that state for torts 95 See Stout v.

There was clearly no partnership between the rechartered corporation and the original corporation, and no assumption of obligations by the new. Yet the law is settled that an obligation arising before re- incorporation may be enforced against the association as a cor- poration of the rechartering state.99 Furthermore, no theory of privity explains the law as to judg- ments. In Union Trust Co. v. Rochester R. &amp; R. Co.,100 a judg- ment had been obtained in New York against a New York railroad, and suit was brought in Pennsylvania where the railroad was also incorporated. The defendant claimed that the Pennsyl- vania corporation, not being before the New York court, was not bound by that judgment. This contention was, however, flatly rejected. Applied to such a case, the term " privity " can do no more than describe a result -it does not give a reason. The fact is that associations, like human beings, have property rights and duties if, and only if, the law gives them personality. But when given personality, it is the human beings and associa- tions, not their personality or personalities, that have property, rights, and duties. Thus, from a consideration of the decisions re- ferred to in this section, we can see the necessity for emphasizing the reality and unity of the association despite its multiple incor- poration, and of distinguishing between the association, the sub- ject of legal qualifications, and its personality or personalities, the faculties which make such qualifications possible. CONCLUSION An incorporated association is a real entity upon which some state has by its law conferred the status of legal personality. Legal personality is the capacity to enter into legal relations and the process of conferring this capacity upon an association is known as incorporation. Where there are several incorporations, there are several personalities, though only one factual entity. While associations are realities, they do not act. Only human beings do, and when a state incorporates, it enables certain hu- 99 In re The Boston, Hartford &amp; Erie R. R., Fed. Cas. No. i,677 (C. C. Conn. i87I) - 100 29 Fed. 609 (W. D.

At common law, stockholder meetings must be held in a state of charter, although directors' meetings need not. A statute, however, may change the situation, and, if the charter state consents, stockholder meetings, probably even organization meetings, may be held in a non-charter state. On the other hand, directors' meetings outside a charter state may be forbidden. When an association is incorporated by only one state, and an act is done on its behalf therein, no corporate conflict of laws prob- lem arises. But, if an act is done on its behalf outside the charter state, it becomes necessary first to determine whether the state where the act is done has jurisdiction to bind the association. That state has jurisdiction if the act was caused or ratified by human beings empowered by the charter state to bind the associa- tion. Even when not so caused or ratified, the state where the act was done has jurisdiction when the association was doing business in that state and the act was done in the course of that business and was within the corporate capacity of the association by the law of the charter state. Having ascertained that a state has jurisdiction, the next question is whether it will exercise that jurisdiction and bind the association. As a matter of common law, it will not, unless the act was caused by those human beings empowered to bind the association or was within the scope of the authority of the actor under its own law. Even then, there is a further question. If the act is one which by the law of the charter state is ultra vires for reasons not of purely local concern to that state, it will be treated as ultra vires in the foreign state, and the foreign state will give it the same effect that it would similar ultra vires action on behalf of associations incorporated by it. Similarly, when an association is incorporated by more than one state, and an act is done on its behalf in a charter state, while that domiciliary state has jurisdiction to affect the association, it will not do so, unless the act was caused by those human beings empowered by the law of some charter state to cause the act, or, if not so caused, was under its law within the scope of the authority of the actor. When these conditions are fulfilled, the charter state where the act was done should determine by its own law</page><page sequence="34">MULTIPLE INCORPORATION AND CONFLICT OF LAWS 549 whether the act was intra or ultra vires and apply the same conse- quences to such act as to similar intra or ultra vires action of other associations incorporated by it. If the act in question is done in a non-charter state, the action should be dealt with as would an act done on behalf of a singly incorporated association, except that if intra vires by the law of any charter state it should be treated as intra vires in the non-charter state.'0' Property rights and duties belong to the association, not to one or more of its personalities. Where an association incorporated by more than one state, acquires property or incurs obligations through any of its personalities, this property may be dealt with and the obligations enforced through any of its personalities. We have here considered three classes of conflict problems and applied thereto a corporate theory which is intrinsically reason- able, aids in attaining desirable results, and which, it is believed, fits these cases better than any other. The importance of insist- ing that the association should be treated as a reality and a single entity, and the necessity for distinguishing this entity from its personality or personalities have been seen throughout the paper and particularly in the last class of decisions considered. Here it is evident that some one repository for property and other legal rights and duties is called for by the decisions. The importance of emphasizing that associations do not act but that human beings do has similarly been seen throughout the article, particularly in con- nection with the analysis of problems involved in corporate meet- ings and ultra vires action. It is hoped that this paper will be of value in aiding a more widespread recognition of the validity of the corporate analysis here outlined which has been substantially adopted by the restaters of conflict of laws for the American Law Institute. It is only on the basis of some such theory that desir- able results may be reached without resort to absurd fiction and explanations quite out of accord with common law precepts and technique.

BOSTON, MASS. 101 Since the analysis of the factors which should lead a state to determine whether an act done on behalf of a multiply incorporated association is ultra or intra vires, is not strictly part of the subject of this paper, it will not be reviewed here.</page></plain_text>
