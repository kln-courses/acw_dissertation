The master had foreseen his end; miraculous events accompanied his passing. Following Huineng's instructions, the pupils opened the casket and found that his body had resisted decaying. This was the ultimate sign of the master's attainment of perfection after a life spent "embodying the Law" in the world. The pupils had the body "glued and lacquered." Huineng's "true-body" (zhen shen) was thus enshrined inside a stupa for the veneration of monastic and lay community. The miraculous discovery of Huineng's "true body" had immediate consequences on the economic assets of the monastic community he supervised and on the consolidation of his doctrinal lineage in the decades to follow. Despite contentions among local communities, theft attempts, vandalism, war, and natural threats, the lacquered body of Huineng survives today and welcomes festive crowds of pilgrims in the Hall of the Sixth Patriarch of the Nanhua Monastery, near Shaoguan, Qujiang County, Guangdong province (fig.1).1 The practice of preserving material remains of eminent monks as cult objects has a long history in China that predates Huineng's time and continues today.2 Early records mention naturally preserved bodies accidentally found in secluded places where masters had withdrawn while awaiting death.3 By the beginning of the seventh century, bodies began to be artificially treated through gilding and lacquering and exposed to a wider audience within ad hoc demarcated spaces.4 This critical change paved the way for the proliferation of lacquered bodies during the eighth and ninth centuries. The practice of adding layers of lustrous lacquer to desiccated corpses participated in a broader process of the iconization of death, a new conceptualization of the value of the sacred in its tangible and material dimensions, and a new definition of the dead body as an object of veneration rather than of defilement and loathing. The existence of the lacquered body in Buddhist devotional practices has attracted considerable scholarly I would like to thank Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, Harvey Molotch, Emanuele Lugli, Volker Kaul, and Worth Bracken. My deepest gratitude goes to Jonathan Hay and Francesco Pellizzi for continued encouragement and support. 1. The hagiography of Huineng is constructed upon three main sources: Caoqi Dashi zhuan (ca. 781), Baolin zhuan (ca. 796), and Six Patriarch's Platform Sutra (Liuzu tan jing) of controversial dating. The fourth important source is Jingde quandeng lu (1004). The first mention of Huineng's lacquered body appears in the Caoqi Dashi zhuan (X86, 1598, 52, 13). References to Buddhist texts conform to the electronic version Taisho shinshu daizokyo (New Buddhist Canon compiled during the Taisho Reign) 100 vols. (Tokyo: Taisho issaikyo kankokai, 1924-1932). All primary and secondary sources relating to the "cult" of Huineng, in its textual and physical manifestations, have been collected in the monumental study by John J. Jorgensen, Inventing Hui-neng, the Sixth Patriarch: Hagiography and Biography in Early CWan (Leiden: Brill, 2005), which appeared half-way through my research on the subject.

A visit to Nanhua Monastery in October 2006 crowned my ongoing interest on Huineng. 2.

Acknowledging the existence of other centers such as Jiuhuashan, this study pertains only to the three cases of the Nanhua monastery.

As contemporary Buddhist scholarship has increasingly questioned earlier "modernist" assumptions on Buddhism, the status of the lacquered body has accordingly come into sharper focus.5 In modern Buddhist scholarship, the lacquered body exists as another site for the unfolding of the paradoxical normative Buddhist stands on representation and truth as articulated by the complex doctrinal interpretation of the multiple natures of the Buddha. Politically, its cult sheds light on the ways in which Buddhism incorporated local chthonian cults into its ever-expanding pantheon as a means for reinforcing its presence in Chinese society.6 Lacquered bodies, therefore, embodied (and articulated formally) contrasting forces within the Buddhist system of canonical impositions, doctrinaire differentiations, and the "practical" needs of cult and devotion. From its early appearance as an ethnographic curiosity to its contemporary embodiment of the deconstructing strategies of Buddhist postmodern scholarship, the allure of the lacquered bodies has continued unabated. And yet, few notable exceptions aside, their analysis has remained largely a prerogative of Buddhologists. Controversial dating, uncertain biography, and uneasy placement within established categories of artifacts have generally defied art historical inquiries, pushing the lacquered body to a liminal state of intermittent visibility Along the line of analysis explored by historians of Buddhism, the ontological distinction between the inanimate material object and the invisible charisma the object stands for in the world is solved in the moment of ritual activation, when invocation, movement, and meditation initiate a process of conflation between the two parts. This process transforms the object into a living entity, existing in the world and partaking of both the (seemingly) distinct realms of visible and invisible. This aspect is central to the context of funerary and mourning practices, where multiple items associated with the deceased are employed to become the deceased in an articulated choreography of death that intends to "fill the gap" between waning physical presence and the enduring spiritual charisma. In terms of function, a wide array of objects can be used as long as they are recognized as potential carriers of energetic charisma, be it figurative as well as nonfigurative, such as spirit tablets or writing. While acknowledging the fundamental contribution that the functionalist approach has provided in bringing the religious artifact out of the museum, I nonetheless sense that a view too closely focused on contextual constraints runs the risk of overlooking why a given object looks the way it does and why, at some point in history, certain categories of objects were selected instead of others to elicit a particular response, no matter the truth they conveyed. While ritual remains central in defining the ontological framework of religious artifacts, it reveals too little regarding what kind of relation a given production mode established with a mode of reception or between ritual norm and visual form.7 A closer look at the lacquered body therefore will raise important questions on the ways in which ritual, art, doctrine, and devotion intertwined in the creation of religious artifacts. The particular position held by the lacquered body within the theatre of multiples of Buddhist funerary and mourning practices lingers between the two poles of Buddhist manifestation of the sacred as embodied by the iconic tradition of portraits and images and the aniconic or prerepresentational nature of the relic?between a metaphoric and a metonymic logic of the sacred. Robert Sharf and Doris Croissant tackled similar questions in pioneering studies on the cult of lacquered bodies. As an art historian, Croissant sees the emergence of lacquered bodies as interrelated to analogous practices of inserting relics in funerary portraits or replicating viscera and other devices in contemporary statuary.8 Croissant connects the practice of treating dead bodies to the ancient and essentially Chinese interest in alchemic manipulation of natural cycles and in what Anna Seidel defines as the "post-mortem immortality" in Daoist tradition.9 For Croissant, the emergence of the cult of 5.

As a Buddhologist, Sharf approaches the cult of the lacquered body from the perspective of texts, both descriptive and prescriptive. Sharf locates the practice of lacquering bodies in relation to other forms of ancestor devotion and interprets it as coexisting with a growing awareness about lineage formation among Buddhist affiliations.10 As "a signifier enmeshed in its own dialectical negation," the lacquered body became for Sharf the ultimate embodiment of the scholastic dialectic between truth and representation. Whether "idolizations of enlightenment" or Daoist-inspired "cicada husks" (chantui), the lacquered body owes the reason of its existence in the world to an absence (that created by death or disappearance) and makes that absence visible through a new kind of presence. But what kind of presence the lacquered body establishes and how it articulates presence remain largely unanswered questions. The following pages are a preliminary attempt at reintegrating a discussion of forms within the anthropological framework set out by recent Buddhist scholarship and generally endorsed by Buddhist art specialists. First, I am interested in exploring the possibilities that the lacquered body demarcated its own space of existence as a discrete category distinguished from that of the relic and that of the funerary portrait by the very mode of production employed in its making.11 The manufacturing process was essential for allowing the translation of the dead body into a powerful object of devotion through a process of reification of the material and tangible nature of the miracle itself. In the making of lacquered bodies, certain formal features were emphasized over others, in order to establish a particular relationship between object and viewer. This relationship rested on the latter's participatory intervention in the progressive revelation of the miracle through time. Second, I will explore the possibility that the lacquered body positioned itself beyond the framework of man-made, artificially recreated objects and linked its existence in the world to a lineage of "true images" (x/ang), a particular category of phenomena whose authority rested on the very fact of just being "out there" and able to break free from the relational connectivity sustaining natural manifestations.12 Because of their self-contained nature and self-generating charisma, "true images" defy established patterns of recognition and identification, thus problematizing the relationship between efficacy and affect. By moving beyond the founding myth of resemblance as precondition for the Buddhist interpretation of representation, the lacquered body positioned itself before and beyond representation, as the very matrix of the process that brought the miracle into existence. This tendency toward overcoming history and spatio-temporal distinction was possible in the particular ideological, political, and economic context of the early Tang Dynasty (6T8-907). With the institutionalization of Buddhism, a long process that began right at the time of Huineng and reached its climax during the Song Dynasty (960-1127), the mythical paradigm of representation had to be rewritten on something that was deliberately marginalized, if not forgotten altogether. Inside/outside Very little is and was then known of Huineng. The political attacks that Huineng's self-proclaimed pupil Shenhui (684-758) launched against competing Buddhist affiliations from the 730s onward blurred the boundaries between historical evidence and legendary fabrications around this charismatic southern master.13 A biographical skeleton can nevertheless be sketched: Huineng, surnamed Lu, was a Guangdong local who spent most of his life in his native province.14 Having Revolution and Permanence in the History of Religions, ed. S. Shaked, D. Shulman, G. Strousma, etal. (Leiden: Brill, 1987), pp. 223-237. 10. Sharf (see note 2). 11. It is my intention to reconsider the lacquered body in relation to the recent developments of scholarship in Western medieval images. As the work of historians of medieval Europe, such as Patrick Geary, Caroline Bynum, and Peter Brown has deeply affected the ways in which Buddhologists have interpreted the "pragmatic" and political dimensions of relic veneration, I believe that the new directions of medieval studies will prove equally fruitful for reconsidering Buddhist icons and relics as forms.

He then returned to the South with Hongren's robe and the rice bowl as symbols of the bestowed legitimacy. However, that legitimacy was contested heatedly by the pupils of another of Hongren's students, Shenxiu (606-706), who claimed the lineage for themselves from their headquarters at Shaolin Monastery. The dispute turned into a scission between the Northern or "Gradualist" school and the Southern or "Subitist" school of Hongren, which ultimately established itself as the canonical lineage during the Song Dynasty.15 Huineng's teachings were collated in a later text known as the Sixth Patriarch's Platform Sutra, which became the foundational text of Southern Chan Buddhism.16 In 676, Huineng was ordained at the Guangxiao Monastery of Guangzhou, where a lock of his hair is venerated. The following year, he moved to Nanhua. In 713, the master took a bath, seated himself in the lotus posture, and passed away. A dispute between local monasteries emerged right after Huineng's death.17 Huineng's activity in the South soon attracted the attention of the Tang court. Empress Wu of the Zhou Dynasty, the short-lived interregnum founded by China's only female ruler between a.d. 690 and 705, invited Huineng to the court. Unable to persuade him, she built a monastery that became the center of his post mortem veneration.18 Emperor Daizong (r. 762-779) canonized Huineng's scriptures in 765 and had his robe transferred to court. It was returned only after Huineng himself had appeared in a dream to the emperor. In 812, Huineng was bestowed the title of "Chan Master of the Great Mirror." On that occasion, the Luminous Stupa was erected at Nanhua, and Liu Zongyuan (773-819) was invited to compose a celebratory eulogy.19 After its destruction in the 960s, the stupa was rebuilt and baptized as the "Great Peace and Prosperity of Empire/' Together with other powerful relics confiscated in the region, Huineng's lacquered body was taken/carried as a palladium to the capital of the newly founded Song Dynasty. As Huineng's collected sayings and fabricated legends penetrated the North, as consequence of Shenhui's restless activity, the lacquered body attracted pilgrims from all over the Buddhist world. The monk Jianzhen (Jap. Ganjin) travelled through Guangdong around 748 750 and left the earliest record of the cult surrounding Huineng's "true image (x/ang)."20 The poets Song Zhiwen (d. 713), Zhang Yue (667-730), and later Su Shi (1036 1101) tempered the harsh fate of an exile with frequent visits to the monastery and profound professions of faith to the master and his teaching.21 From the tenth century on, Huineng's lacquered body, together with that of an earlier Indian master Arya Jnanabhaishagya housed in a neighboring temple, became the object of a local cult that interested the local ruling clan of the Liu. Zanning (919-1001), author of Biographies of Song Monks (989) and former ambassador of the Song state to Guangdong, reports that once a year the "true body" of Huineng was taken across the counties and inside the royal palace in lavish processions that ensured good harvest and abundant rain.22 This tradition continued well into the modern era. When Matteo Ricci visited the temple in 1589, he could not but express deep deprecation for the idolatric fervor surrounding this "venerated monster."23 There was, and still is today, a powerful association between the miraculous event and the specific locality in which it took place and from which the auspicious efficacy continues to radiate. The miraculous discovery of Huineng's "true body," its resistance to conforming to established patterns of relic circulation and accumulation, contributed to the integration of this hitherto peripheral enclave within the cohesive religious geography of Song China, transforming this mountainous 15.

It is embellished with all the accoutrements required by his position in the monastic hierarchy and installed on a high dais protected by glass. At its side two equally lavish altars hold the lacquered bodies of Hanshan Deqing (1545-1623), a religious reformer who moved to Shaoguan in 1600 and was mummified there in 1623, and Dantian [Cinnabar Field] (d.u.), a local thaumaturge. The two recent lacquered bodies flank the model of Huineng with brownish lacquer smoothly throughout; together they form a powerful triad of lustrous substance shining beneath elegantly embroidered garments and reflecting off the gilded lattice frames of the altar.24 West of the Hall of the Sixth Patriarch stands a stone stupa that marks the site of the burial of Xu Yun (1839-1959). This well-known monk was instrumental in the revival of the monastery in modern times.25 When death approached him at the venerable age of 120 years, Xu Yun closed his eyes in meditation posture. A photograph shows him, hands holding a rosary, longing for yet another miraculous discovery?that of his own body-relic. For both funerary portraits and icons of legendary Buddhist deities and past parerga, the charisma of the image rests on the possibility of its activation. Several procedures existed, all entailing some kind of physical intervention with the artifact. One is the insertion of relics as source of energetic flow. Relics [shell) comprise pebble-like crystallized accretions of charisma surviving after cremation, as well as ashes or everyday objects that have entered in contact with the deceased. Placed inside their new "immortal" abode, relics transformed the inanimate matter of the artifact into a living manifestation of the deceased. At the same time, the shape of the artifact allowed the amorphous energetic flow of the relic to be recognized as emanating from a particular, individualized source. For example, the elaborate portrait-monument of Hongbian, dated 24. According to later hagiographies, in 1477 Huineng appeared in a dream to a local governor and asked to have his body removed from the stupa to a newly built hall. 25. Xu Yun received a visit from Huineng in a dream where the master instructed him to return to Nanhua and restore the monastery. See Xu Yun, Empty Cloud: The Autobiography of the Chinese Zen Master Xu Yun (Shaftesbury: Element, 1988), p. 115. The lacquered body of Huineng was spared from the destruction accompanying the Japanese occupation of the area in 1942. Figure 2. Funerary portrait-monument of Hongbian, ca. 862.

After Peng Huashi, Die Hdhlentempel von Dunhuang: ein Jahrtausend chinesischer (Kunst Stuttgart, Klett Cotta, 1982), pi. 196. 862 in cave 16 at Mogao, presents the virtuous abbot, responsible for revamping the site, in a stage-like setting of painted and sculpted elements that plot the man's second coming to life (fig. 2). In the back of the statue, a small opening contained what were presumably Hongbian's ashes. The lustrous eyes and shading of the man's face enhances the "presentness" of the portrait and its impact on viewers. This kind of mortuary statuary is generally connected to three-dimensional funerary portraits made of clay mixed with ashes {guhuixiang, lit. "Bone-ash-image"). No examples survive, but textual evidence, such as the account of the Korean monk Wuxiang ("Non-Image"; d. 756), indicates that this tradition, equally entrenched with achieving maximum formal and conceptual identity between lingering spirit</page><page sequence="7">48 RES 55/56 SPRING/AUTUMN 2009 and enduring materiality, reached its climax during the seventh and eighth centuries, just around the time lacquered bodies also began to appear.26 Once the energetic source of the relic was placed inside the inert material, it was necessary to reveal its potency by providing it with an outward trajectory. That occurred through the channelling of energetic flow during the eye-opening ceremony27 Pupils could be dotted in ink or inserted in lustrous material. The eye-opening ceremony, which crowned the coming into existence of all figurative Buddhist (and noh Buddhist) images, marked the most critical moment in the activation of an icon, since it calibrated the icon's power to its surrounding space and balanced it in a relational exchange with the worshipper's response to it. This process of aligning inside and outside, the artifact and the world, was impressed in the very physical appearance of the object, via dotting, inserting, or concealing one or more of its constituent parts. Significantly, no aposteriori intervention seems to have been conducted on the lacquered body. Huineng's downward eyes are sealed under a thin layer of lacquer. The lacquering operation defies the outward trajectory that sets religious icons in interaction with the surrounding environment. The absence of a focalized channel of energetic transmission allows the artifact to be perceived as a complete and self-contained whole. Rather than mediating between formless inside and modeled outside, the lacquering coating manifests and conceals its content, directing the worshipper to what lies beneath. As disengaged from the activating and disactivating procedures of the ritual, the lacquered body presents a relative and nonabsolute degree of formal approximation to the human model. The absence of devices intended to enhance the sense of truth and lifelikeness of the artifact calls into question the value of resemblance and anthropomorphic figuration as signification in Buddhist portraiture. The place of likeness One of the earliest documents for the study of lacquered bodies is an undated photograph of a Vietnamese ascetic published by Paul Demieville in 1965 (fig. 3).28 When looking at it, one cannot but be drawn to the particularly reductive approach to form: The lacquer enshrouds the man's body with a lustrous and even coat on which junctures, bones, and natural imperfections impress themselves. Deeper cuts around the man's eyes and cheeks capture reflecting light and are cast downward, in the direction of its skeletal crossed legs. Deprived of his attributes and dislodged against the white background of a photographer's studio, the lacquered body confronts the viewer with disconcerting immediateness, positing the very enigma of its existence as lingering between manufactured and found, organic and inorganic, natural and artificial. If nothing in the specific features of the artifact points to its exalted status and "natural" difference, what does allow the recognition of it as an object of veneration to take place? How to reconcile the two operations of recognition and identification with a particular, historically determined individual? The present state of Huineng's lacquered body has been studied by a group of Chinese scholars. Their report confirms the presence of human bones beneath the lacquer coating, but leaves questions about dating and identification safely circumstantial.29Throughout its supposedly long history, restorations, repairs, and rituals have ostensibly affected the way the object looks today. Installed on a high dais, dressed with lavish garments and framed by bountiful offerings, Huineng's lacquered body is almost completely concealed from view. Its slightly tilted head, half-closed eyes, and sealed mouth transmit a sense of calm absorption and detached attentiveness to the busy community around him, now engaged as never before in the protection and propagation of its miraculous nature. From the perspective of iconography and typological classification, Huineng's body adheres to established conventions of representing spiritual authority within the monastic community as a visual conflation of the Three Jewels: the Buddha that his posture and moral integrity evoke, the community that his model inspires, and the law that his historical experience manifests and transhistorical legacy materializes.30 26.

Doubts, illation, and iconoclastic attacks date back as early as the beginning of the lacquered-body cult itself.31 Sir Percival Yetts, the great connoisseur of Chinese ceramics and early investigator of this practice, reports that the Qianlong Emperor (r. 1 736-1 795), during a short passage through Nanjing, dismissed a lacquered body in a local temple by declaring with disdain: "He is no Buddha, but merely a dry-body (rengan)\"32 Huineng, too, became the target of vandalic acts, the last time during the Cultural Revolution.33 The complex process by which the Nanhua lacquered body came to be identified with the historical figure of Huineng, the Sixth Patriarch of Chan Buddhism, was the result of ideological, political, and economic factors that are reminiscent of other cases of lacquered bodies, mummies, and bodily fragments that have changed name over time, or lost one altogether.34 In China, the production of memorializing portraiture began around the time material remains of eminent spiritual leaders became objects of devotion. The function and appearance of these artifacts has provided much ground to the challenges put forth by Buddhologists. Art-historical narratives, with a certain determinism, have held that portraits were made as seals 31. Father Nicholas Trigauld reports that: "The temple ministers also showed them the body of Lusu [Liuzu, Huineng], enveloped in that peculiar shiny bituminous substance known only to the Chinese.

Griffith Foulk carried out an extensive analysis of a wide range of primary sources to show that references to portraits as seals of transmissions were nowhere to be found.36 Instead, portraits were employed through distinctive moments of funerary rituals, when the deceased took on a double existence, with the lay community focusing on the deceased's material remains and the monastic community on their artificial duplicate. When the ritual was accomplished and the charisma secured within its new "immortal" abode in guise of the portrait, the funerary effigy was placed inside ad hoc patriarch halls. Side by side with analogous duplicates from the past, the funerary portraits created a constellation of accumulated charisma that gained power through endless reverberation. This energetic field crossed historical distinctions and provided tangible evidence for the spiritual (and economic) claims of a given monastic community. The particular context for which the image was intended, be it ritual etiquette, position within an architectural space, or placement within an ideal lineage of like-minded individuals, determined the object's appearance. Variously reformulated over the years, this view proposed a functionalist interpretation of likeness based on a fixed association between likeness and identity. Gregory Levine has recently presented the case of a seventeenth-century portrait of a sixteenth-century abbot preserved in the Korin'in, Kyoto.37 Levine's accidental discovery of an inscription inside the hollow neck of the statue allowed him to reconstruct its biography. At some point in the nineteenth century, the statue was removed from its original setting in a neighboring temple. That spatial translation entailed also a conceptual one as a new identity, linked to the particular history of Korin'in, was attributed to the statue, with no alteration of its physical appearance. More than the case of a decentered object, Levine's study outlines a theory of likeness that takes into account the particular framing and the specific expectations of its intended audience. Identification of an artifact as embodying/representing a specific individual is the result of a combination of factors that include suitability of the artifact to established iconographic conventions and the particular context in which the image is exhibited. Physiognomic accuracy and visual correspondence to a supposed historical or living model is constructed by the specific requirements an image had to fulfill in a given context. Unlike other forms of post-mortem duplicates or replicas, the lacquered body is characterized by a relative and non-absolute degree of approximation to human form that calls for complex operations of recognition and identification. If nothing in the appearance of the object per se (beyond its very existence in the world) hints at the exalted status of the individual thus enshrined, it is a contextual operation that ultimately sanctions the recognition of the body as a "special one" as well as its identification with a particular historical individual. Furthermore, devoid of signs of activation and ritual investiture, its empowering context is that of the physical enshrinement, rather than the one outlined by ritual. When removed from the sacred premises of its location and stripped of the marks associated with its particular position and typological classification, the "true body" abdicates its claim, regressing into an undefined state between the made and the found, the figurative and the nonfigurative, the awe inspiring and the loath-inducing (fig. 4). Resemblance as the founding paradigm According to Levine, the realness of Buddhist funerary portraits operates in tension with "realistic" representation.38 Buddhist normative literature variously articulated the paradoxical relation between representation and truth playing over the polysemy of the word zhen as both "portrait" and "truth."39 This is not the place to delve into doctrinal argumentations; suffice it to say that the leaning toward certain visual and formal strategies rested on cultic practices that laid beyond the ritual etiquette, on those devotional behaviors that developed alongside that etiquette. As Paul Mus concisely put it, "critical discussion came after didactic imitation."40 35.

A well known account is that of the statue commissioned by King Prasenajit that would become the most "authentic" substitute of the Buddha: The Buddha had gone ninety days earlier to the Trayastrimsa Heaven to preach the law to his mother. King Prasenajit, regretting not being able to see him, had a statue carved in sandalwood . . . and had it placed at the spot where the Buddha used to sit. Later, when the Buddha returned to his vihara, the statue came out to welcome him. The Buddha said: "Return to your seat. After my nirvana, you will serve as model to the four categories of followers." The statue sat down. This statue is the first of a multitude.41 From the earliest mythical manifestations, Buddhist duplicates were built on a paradigm of resemblance. The legitimacy for the duplicates' existence in the world was grounded on the degree of believable proximity between duplicate and original as manifested by a constructed notion of "likeness" through an aggregation of factors incorporating spatial and contextual demarcation, iconographic convention, typological classification, and established patterns of response. The relational connectivity between the model and the duplicates plays out in a conflict of presences, with the duplicate taking up the space left vacant by the disappeared original. This initial rupture is nevertheless overcome by the identification of the duplicate as the new original, with formal and visual identity as signifying interchangeability and transsubstantiality between the two. This point still leaves a question unanswered. While the rhetorical dimensions of Chan iconoclasm and antinomianism have been thoroughly explored by modern Buddhist studies and while, as we have seen, at the level of function, figurative and nonfigurative objects were completely interchangeable, why was it that the more "realistic" and truth-like an image was, the more effective and affecting was it considered to be for embodying a particular truth? If several artifacts were functionally interchangeable, they by no means were formally interchangeable; rather, the contrary. True likeness and intensified naturalism, on top of figuration itself, emerged as the most suitable forms to elicit a Figure 4. Lacquered Body of Hanshan Deqing, seventeenth century(?).

Within this aspect of Buddhist visuality, a growing awareness of the redeeming nature of techne became integral to the mythical etiology of the Buddhist image. Little is known of the circumstances surrounding the discovery of Huineng's body. Very little was known at the time of his death as well. The epitaph composed by Wang Wei (701-761) artfully plays on balancing specificity and allusions: "[He] was a man from a certain commandery and a certain prefecture / he died on an uncertain day of an unknown year. / On a certain date his spirit was shifted to Caoxi and was enshrined in a certain place."42 The reconstruction of the Tang funerary 41.

Fangbian did not understand his intent, and so modelled the master's likeness [zhen] to a height of seven cun, perfectly capturing his charisma. The Master looked at it and said, "You are good at the nature of sculpture, but are no good at the nature of Buddha." He rewarded Fangbian with a robe and things. The monk bowed and departed.45 Following the standard dialogical structure of Buddhist hagiographies, the anecdote underlines Fang Bian's inadequacy at grasping "the nature of Buddha," when the Buddha (the master) stands in front of him. The need for duplicates becomes urgent with the disappearance of the original (like in the case of the Prasenajit statues) or, we could argue, in the creation of a "duplicate" that retains the original within. The naming of an individual responsible for the making of the artifact is significant as it signals the emerging preoccupation for the nature of the miracle and the acceptability of its material proof as object of devotion. Somehow reminiscent of the cult of Saint Luke as "author" of famous Christian acheiropoieta, the appearance of a name over a cult constructed upon the rejection of authorship indicates a shift in the source of the authority of the auratic image (now sanctioned by the authority of touch, rather than by the intrinsic qualities of the image).46 However, by leveling the status of the auratic image to that of other explicitly manmade artifacts, it enhances even more its exceptionality as the byproduct of an unrepeatable process of substance transference. For all cases previously mentioned, the authenticity of the image was constructed upon the creation of a proximity, physical and emotional, between the author of the duplicate and the model. But rather than explaining likeness and reinforcing verisimilitude, proximity was rhetorically employed to legitimize, and to a certain extent approve, the intrinsic alterity of any given image in relation to others. The association between alterity and authenticity, and how it plays out in efficacy, reconfigures the value ascribed to artistry as mediation in the creation of religious artifacts. Wendi Adamek has recently presented important evidence on the relationship among representation, efficacy, and techne. Her studies focus on portrait eulogies, a particular kind of prose-poetry composition that was inscribed on funerary portrait paintings as part of their activating procedures.47 Wuzhu (714-774) (lit. "no-abode") was the founder of the Bao Tang (Protect the Tang) sect of Buddhism, a Sichuanese affiliation that had strong ties with Huineng and his disciples. He was a student of the Korean monk Wuxiang who had his ashes turned into a bone-and-clay funerary portrait. His portrait does not survive but it is recorded in the sect's sacred text, the Lidai fabao ji (ca. 774-780). According to this source, a certain Sun Huan composed the eulogy praising the painting for retaining both the master's original "life-force" and his expression that "quivers and wants to speak." Upon the master's passing, a painter was summoned "to paint a portrait [zhenji, lit. "true traces"]. "[The artist]," the text continues, "pushed the brush and produced the characteristics," and a perfect duplicate of the model appeared on the material support as if "truly breathing, ... the eyes dance and are about to see."48 Technical perfection and painstakingly accurate recreation of one's features ("[i]f there is even one whisker too much/then it is not the person")49 ensures the transmission of charisma from its original source to its new dwelling, reinforcing absence through presence. Unlike later examples that were produced in multiples, the Tang funerary portrait was a unicum and, 43. Wendi Adamek points out differences in the Tang and the Song funerary protocols. See Adamek, "Imagining the Portrait of a Chan Master" in Faure 2003 (see note 5), pp. 36-73; esp. pp. 53-54. Foulk and Sharf also note that the terms used to define images, portraits, and other kinds of duplicates are generally interchangeable before the Song Dynasty (Foulk and Sharf [see note 30], p. 162).

While Song Dynasty portraits responded to a logic of repetition that established likeness in terms of formal sameness among multiples, the Tang funerary portrait was a spirit impregnated object that gained authority by being the one and only trace of the deceased's vanished presence on earth.50 As such, it served a double function: As an object of veneration, infused with talismanic efficacy, it was the target of invocation; as a visible demonstration of the inherent deceptiveness of representation, it channelled the viewer to the perception of higher truth. If we agree with Didi-Huberman's claim that mimesis is meant to produce belief, we ought to ask what kind of belief these highly truth-like, fully finished, and intensely "real" objects intended to convey.51 By achieving the most articulated form of naturalistic depiction (to the point of inserting real hair or original garments over sculpted images) to facilitate legibility and immediate recognition, Buddhist funerary portraits asserted an absolute truth that revealed itself through the unmasking of the portrait's "real" nature as pure visual fiction (fig. 5). The rhetoric of proximity between original and model as manifested by the accomplishments of technical reproduction further sustains that claim. The denouement of such presentational strategies, embedded in the artifact as well as in the claim itself, points to the impossibility of such an undertaking, through a paradoxical exploitation of the notion of truth-likeness as the ultimate way to grasp one's charisma and retain it in the world "as if he were alive." At the base of this system of endless repetition or "total deconstruction" lay another form of embodying the sacred, one that against that rhetoric of proximity and resemblance, proposed instead a rhetoric of identity and reification, and reset the very source of representation as a byproduct of nature itself. Made and found (The legacy of Dai Kui) The analysis of lacquered bodies in their typological relation to funerary portraits has shown significant differences in mode of production, ideological claims, and cultic expectations. These differences, I would argue, were embedded in the very materiality of the artifact itself as brought out by the particular manufacturing process that enabled the artifact to come into being. The value of process in the Buddhist image-making tradition is still largely an open question that deserves a study of its own. For example, scale and proportions or the selection of certain materials were determinant aspects of the potential auratic nature of certain images.52 All these aspects, regrettably often overlooked in modern scholarship, further challenge a too-focused view on ritual activation as the defining moment of the empowering process of an icon. Unlike the absolute-truth claim that explicitly recreated portraits made by exploiting a rhetoric of maximum legibility and artificiality, the lacquered body comprises a comparably sophisticated set of paradoxes that play out in a tension between a mode of production that reinforces its mediating role for the acceptance of the icon (the lacquer coating that determines the existence of the icon and allows the body to become an image) and, at the same time, effaces itself, allowing the icon to present itself as a self-generated phenomenon. The "authenticity" of the image and its potential efficacy no longer relies on the degree of approximation between the duplicate and a disappeared original (the intensified "realism" of the duplicate that overcomes that original separation), but is, on the contrary, coextensive with it, as a self-referential entity, existing solely in and of itself, before and beyond its activation through ritual. Rather than recognition, it is therefore an act of re-cognition of something already existing in the world that allows the true image to be identified as a source of charisma. Gerhard Wolfs notion of the mediatization of the sacred provides an important interpretative model for exploring these points. In his analysis of the Mandylion, Wolf contends that the unique nature of the artifact emerges from the conflation of relic and image into an inextricable material unit.53 The Mandylion, or 50.

In being an object as well as the image of it, the Veronica transformed its material support into a virtual screen for prayers that guaranteed the transposition of the primordial touch into a form of visual contact. Keeping in mind the fundamental epistemological difference between an incarnated Christ and an immanent Buddha, as well as the fact that the Veronica continued to also refer to an original that had</page><page sequence="14">Matteini: On the "true body" of Huineng 55 disappeared from the world, the notion of the sacred finding its way in the material world via a process of natural self-duplication through imprint resonates with the Chinese notion of the empowered image and Buddhist theories of emotional resonance.54 The very nature of the imprint and its trace is equally evocative of the classical Chinese notion of trace (ji) and the relationship between trace and category (lei), the a priori pattern of substance aggregation that regulates material manifestations and human actions. In both theorizations, the distinction between material and immaterial is annihilated: the image cannot but be perceived through its "irreducible materiality."55 Modern technical analysis shows that the procedure employed in making Huineng's lacquered body is consistent with the dry-lacquer technique (jiazhu) employed for some of the most spectacular free-standing sculptures of the time (fig. 6).56 While some have gone so far as to suggest that this particular tradition developed from the practice of treating human bodies, it might not be a coincidence if the two became entwined and reached their zenith around the time of Huineng.57 By then, the dry-lacquer technique had more than five centuries of history. While its origins are debated, the statues' unique formal qualities, the intense labor involved, and unmatched visual effect were often discussed in terms of divine intervention, and the statues as infused with human agency. In the fifth century, for example, the imperial palace housed a life-size (renzhong) lacquer sculpture of the Buddha that had no equal. Each night the statue would walk about the empty rooms, leaving footprints that attracted local and distant devotees. One night, it walked out the door and was nowhere to be found.58 Figure 6. Seated Buddha, seventh-eighth century. Dry lacquer with traces of gilt and polychrome pigments, h. 98.5 cm. Image ?The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Rogers Fund 1919-19.186. Significantly, the mastering of the dry-lacquer technique soon came to be associated with the founding father of Chinese sculpture, Dai Kui (d. 395). Roughly contemporary to Gu Kaizhi (ca. 344-405?), the patriarch of painting, Dai Kui was a polymath, a gentleman recluse, and a fervent Buddhist, with all characteristics to be enshrined as a model of the perfected artist. Dai Kui and his son Dai Yong gained a name for a celebrated set of five lacquer "portable images" (xing xiang) that were installed inside the capital's Waguan Temple. The statues were so extraordinary in their form that they emitted continuous light?light being a topos consistently used in medieval discourses on portent and miracles.59 Dai Kui had grown increasingly dissatisfied with contemporary Buddhist images, which he felt were inferior to Western (that is, Indian or Central Asian) and Ancient images in their inability to "stir men's heart."60 When facing the task to create a wooden portrait of the Buddha, Dai Kui pondered for years before "giving form (zao)" to an image that "exceeded anything previously known." According to later biographers, Dai Kui's success depended upon his ability to "attain the utmost in Truthfulness [zhen]" and to infuse such a sense of compassion that the worshipper felt as if he or she were standing "in the presence of the Truth itself."61 As the Fayuan zhulin, a seventh-century 54.

The total correspondence between duplicate and prototype, as achieved propiis colo'ribus, establishes authorlessness as the ultimate manifestation of authorship. The authenticity of the image was made visible in the possibility of engendering unprecedented responses, which the artist detected by hiding among the crowd.63 As expressed in Dai Kui's fascination for foreign images, integral to the notion of the handless hand in the mythical etiology of the empowered image, is an emphasis on distance, be it geographical or physical, between the original apparition of the image and its present manifestation. Similar to what happened when Byzantine icons penetrated into the early modern Western world, the formal and conceptual differences of this particular kind of images were explained as byproducts of divine intervention or through the trope of the self-generated image.64 The authority of the image, characterized by an ambiguous conflation of contemporaneity and timelessness, manifested itself in the acknowledgment of its alterity. In a way, the "dramaturgy of distance" implemented the rhetoric of proximity as the a priori condition for the imprinting operation that brought the image into the world.65 The repetition, in accounts concerned with miraculous images, of topoi related to dreams, apparitions, and mystery further emphasized the image's ability to disassociate itself from the chain of relational connectivity, becoming integral to its very mythopoiesis. Be it the self-generated natural form or the byproduct of a self-effaced hand, the image's rejection of facture positioned the viewer as if standing before "truth itself." The matter of the sacred The myth of origin of the miraculous image, the image's capability of breaking free from the relational connectivity between original and multiple, and its potential to establish itself as a "new beginning" rests on the notion of the religious artifact as a by-product of a substance translation from the invisible to the visible via an imprint or trace. All Chinese icons could be considered as responding to the double function of making the invisible visible and proving the existence of an unintelligible and formless beyond.66 The funerary eulogies discussed by Wendi Adamek make this point poignantly. And the invisible-visible trajectory holds true for the lacquered body as well. Its relation with the invisible beyond nonetheless neither responds to a logic of metaphor (as in the case of sculpted or painted images) nor to a logic of metonymy (as in the case of relics). Rather, it reifies the existence of the invisible within the visible, through a mode of production that simultaneously reveals and conceals the miracle of its existence in the world, conflates container and content, image and sign into an inextricable conceptual and physical unity that exists solely within its material boundaries. After all, the material and tangible dimension of the "true image" is embedded in the very etymology of the word xiang itself, which, from early on was virtually interchangeable with the character meaning "elephant" and as an extension, ivory and ivory figurines.67 The seventh and eighth centuries witnessed an unprecedented number of relic manifestations, discoveries, and reports of portentous phenomena. Antonino Forte, Chen Jinhua, andT. H.

For example, in 677, the capital woke up under a portentous cloud lingering over the Guangzhai district. Excavations unearthed a small casket containing ten thousand radiating pebbles of crystal.69 Upon Wu Zetian's enthronement in 690, the relics were distributed among newly founded monasteries across the empire as a way to draw new boundaries of the Buddhist realm at the center of which stood the empress. The most revered relic past and present was a fragment of a finger bone that was housed in the understory of the Chongzhen temple, best known today as the Famen Temple, at Fufeng. Rediscovered in 1987, the stone chamber revealed the most extraordinary (and complete) ritual setting, just as it was interred in 874 after the last of the several translations that punctuated the history of the Tang rulers' devotion to them. Allegedly in Chinese soil since the mythic time of the Indian King Asoka (ca. third century b.ce.), the finger bone was "rediscovered" in 659 after numinous manifestations. The following year, it was brought to the palace and rejoined with a fragment of the Buddha's skull brought back from India.70 Two years later, the relics were deposited together inside the Famen temple. On that occasion, the empress commissioned a new set of nine interlocking boxes in the shape of a guocoffin.71 Moving away from the tradition of storing relics within small bottles or jars, this bold innovation enshrined the relic as dead body. Although this particular set is lost, the accoutrements added by later descendants of Empress Wu reinforced this association and magnified her original act of evocation with more complex theological implications. The lavish expenditures and the court's unrelenting endorsement of the cult continued throughout the dynasty, attracting harsh criticism from court officials who saw in the veneration of the "decayed and rotten bones" a sign of the dynasty's incipient decline. According to Eugene Wang, during the early Tang, visual and textual references to relics shifted from the description of light and optical phantasmagoria to address more clearly their bodily and material origin. The emergence of the term "true body," a neologism employed for the Famen relics, signaled a new conceptual association between the historical experience of the Buddha in the world and the lasting traces of his passage.72 The roughly contemporary consolidation of the cult of individual masters through post-mortem duplicates, and the enshrinement of the lacquered body within the sacred topography of the monastery should therefore be considered as interrelated phenomena, all participating in a new figurative institutionalization of the body. Relics and lacquered bodies have several elements in common. They both are remains of living bodies from which they have been separated through a process of purification, be that of cremation or lacquering. From an anthropological perspective, both relics and lacquered bodies have undergone a kind of "secondary burial" focused on the social body of the deceased, rather than its physical remains.73 The recognition of the lacquered body, and even more of the relic, is the result of a process of contextual delimitation. In both cases, their efficacy is not susceptible to activation, and both are infused with agency. The economy of their cult could not however be more different. Relics are fragments that gain power by the very fact of being movable. The lacquered body resists movement and enhances charisma by being a self-sufficient whole.74 More critically, the process of enshrinement of the relic in a coffin-like reliquary establishes a particular relation between content and container, by which the otherwise undistinguished fragment is recognized as belonging to a special body (fig. 7). The reliquary therefore bespeaks the nature of its content and emphasizes its association with death. Through enshrinement, the relic is removed from the realm of the visible. Relics gained efficacy by the very fact of being concealed from view, inaccessible to most but a few chosen ones called upon as witnesses of the miracle.75 On the contrary, the enveloping lacquer 69.

Rather than on invisibility, the cult of the lacquered body centered itself on total visibility and in an inextinguishable and direct exchange with the viewer. It was precisely in this continuous exposure to the world that the lacquered body gained power as a form of miracle unproblematically integrated within the "flux of everyday life." A new beginning The complex task of assessing the implications that the emergence of the cult of the lacquered body had in the devotional landscape of Tang China is made even more daunting by the fragmented evidence surviving from the period and by the layers of interpolation carried on in the Song Dynasty to provide a cohesive genealogy to Buddhism. Huineng's lacquered body nonetheless is a privileged, albeit polemical, vantage point for disentangling which elements of the Tang Buddhist visuality entered into the Song canon. My argument on the relation between the lacquered body and the funerary portrait has called into question the validity of an approach too narrowly centered on ritual. The reformulation of the notion of likeness and identity, the anti-facture approach, and the lack of activating interventions form a coherent set of visual and formal strategies, whose objective was to actualize the paradoxical nature of representation, rather than provide visual articulation to its dogmatic impositions. At the discursive level, textual sources participated in the mythopoiesis of the lacquered body, which, together with other "true images," restaged the initial apparition of the miracle through a virtually endless process of self-empowerment.76 Spatial and temporal dislocation was therefore essential in facilitating the acceptance of a radical cult that aimed at redirecting the devotee toward the very source of charisma itself. As imprint or trace, the lacquered body belonged to a particular category of empowered images that claimed authority by their being prerepresentational as receptacles of the bodily and corporeal nature of the Buddha in his experience in the world. Footprints of the Buddha, for example, are venerated throughout the Buddhist world and their cult was greatly revived when an apparition took place during Wu Zetian's reign.77 Another was the shadow of the Buddha embedded on a rock inside a grotto at Nagahara, present-day Afghanistan.78The monk Faxian (ca. 337-422) reports that the entrance to the cave was narrow and that the shadow was impressed on its southwest wall. If one stood far enough away, one could see "the True Buddha form, golden in color with all the distinguishing marks (xiang) radiantly clear."79 Moving closer, the apparition lost clarity until it disappeared into the natural breaks of the stone. Later travelers similarly reported to have seen a "face [that] was remarkable, of a sort seldom seen" and were awed at the "unique qualities of the image." Some noted that "if one touched [the rock] by hand, one could only feel the stone wall."80 The unsteadiness of the image caused more than anxiety for some travelers who related their failure at perceiving the form to their lack of moral purity. Xuanzang (600-664), for example, remarked with some preoccupation that while "in the old days there 76.

After long praying, a dim light began to appear on the rock, "as if clouds and mist had parted to reveal a golden mountain."82 Others in Xuanzang's party failed to grasp the miracle. The "potential" nature of the image rested on a temporal progression that allowed the form to reach full legibility before reverting into obscurity, and because of that the image resisted reproduction and dissemination.83 Unlike the case of the Veronica, whose intrinsic illegibility was reinforced by the legibility and immediate recognizability of its copies, the Buddha Shadow, as well as other matricial images, resisted multiplication and diffusion, thus generating a reconfiguration of space and time that centered on the specific locality in which the miracle had taken place.84 As an unstable and contingent manifestation, the Shadow is independent in its ontology from the liturgical structure and in its phenomenology from external conditions. Its power, embedded in the very materiality of its physical support and subordinated to the particular spatiotemporal juncture of its perception, materialized a notion of the sacred as caught in the very moment of translation from the aniconic into the iconic.85 In an important and regrettably incomplete study published in this journal, Paul Mus outlined an evocative reading of the aniconic tradition associated with early and Hinayana Buddhism.86 Building on previous research, Mus advocated for a complex interpretation of the iconographic programs of Hinayana cultic spaces as choreographies to guide the worshipper toward an unmediated experience of the Buddha himself.

For Mus, all Buddhist art was engaged with the notion of the event (evenement) and artistic representation was in itself, "a tracing of that first event that thus renders present, in a secondary way, rather than represent it/'87 The "iconography of an aniconic cult" created a virtually endless sequence of stages that re-enacted the original miracle that brought 81.

In a system that ranked all beings according to their "proximity" to the Buddha, experience allowed the endless repetition of its mythical origin. By refusing to subordinate the Buddha to the spatiotemporal constraints of form, the aniconic tradition translated the realism of the image into the "realism of an evocatory act" that reenacted its original manifestation on the model of the pilgrimage.88 As the shadow of the Buddha gradually reveals itself from the exposed rock and achieves full figuration through time, so does the relative degree of mimetic approximation of the lacquered body capture the very moment of the coming into being of the miracle in its material form. Mental concentration therefore "completes" the image, allowing it to achieve a perfected state of full manifestation and thus revealing its "true" and fully articulated appearance. The lacquer coating, however, makes us even more aware that the true matter of the sacred lies elsewhere, beyond sight?perfectly concealed and safely protected beneath a smooth and lustrous coat of brown lacquer. 88.
