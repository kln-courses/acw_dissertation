<plain_text><page sequence="1">Return of the Condor: the Race to Save our Largest Bird from Extinction John Moir The Lyons Press, Guilford, CT 223 pp., cloth. 2006 [ISBN 13: 978-1-59228-949-3] Return of the Condor is a very readable, engaging account of the history of the California Condor Recovery Program and background on why such a program was necessary. Moir introduces the book with a personal narrative that recounts his viewing of a pair of condors in the 1970s. Throughout the book, he tells the story as though the reader observed the events and knew the thoughts of the participants - a style that makes the book read more like a novel than a documentary. Thirty pages of color photos are bound in the center of the book, providing an excellent visual record of all stages of condor life and important phases of condor management. For those who may not be familiar with the condor chronology, in 1967 Gymnog- yps californianus was listed in the Federal Register as a "species threatened with extinction." Its population had been on a downward trajectory for some time. The first recovery plan written under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) was for the California condor. It was adopted in 1975, and the most recent revision is dated 1996. In the early 1980s, eggs were taken from wild nests and hatched in captivity to begin a captive breeding population. However, the wild population continued to plummet, so it was decided to capture all remaining wild condors. The last capture, in 1987, encompassed all 27 individuals of the remaining wild population. Captive breeding proved successful and releases began in the early 1990s. Since that time, there have been both wild and captive condors. The 1987 capture of the last free-flying condor is where the narrative begins. The feelings and actions of Jan Hamber, who made the call to the scientists who would do the capture, are described in cinematic detail. The bird, known as AC9, is one of the important characters in the book. In various places in the book, sounds and smells are described, as well as sights. Chapter Two includes a reconstruction of an adult female condor's foraging trip, including her ob- servation of the last minutes of a pig's life. Jumps in time enhance the story-telling effect, while not always providing an accurate sense of the timeline of events. Mostly, the sensory de- tails add color to the text, but occasionally annoying anthropomorphic lapses occur. For example, ravens are portrayed as villains who "liked nothing better than to drive their heavy bills into condor eggs" (p. 9). Similarly, a condor family group is observed to have "spent their days blissfully unaware of their spe- cies' troubles" (p. 25). As Moir fills in the story mosaic, he focuses on two actors. He has obviously spent time interviewing both of them and there is no question that they are key players. But the roles of others besides Jan Hamber and Noel Snyder are not adequately acknowl- edged, in this reader's opinion. Moir does a good job of describing the plight of the California condor prior to its listing under the ESA and of chronicling the controversy and the disparate points of view of the stakeholders. There is good description of the sides in the debates over whether various management actions, such as captive breeding, tagging, etc., should be employed. He demonstrates how little was known about the species prior to the investigations of Carl Koford in the 1940s. And he raises an excellent point - anyone even slightly acquainted with the condor saga knows that Koford was never in favor of any hands-on management, including captive breeding. Koford claimed that even observations of nests would disturb the birds, causing nest failure. (This is particularly significant because the species only lays one egg per clutch, and may not breed every year.) And yet, Koford himself reported entering nest caves, and his field notes detailed various direct encounters with individual birds, never to the detriment of the condor. The question is: "Why did Koford present the condor as a shy, easily disturbed species?" The reader gains an understanding of some of the challenges faced by the team direct- ing the releases of captively bred condors. The human threats, direct and indirect, to the free-flying birds are well documented. The importance of lead, a hazard in the condor's environment, is laid out. However, the claim on page 57 that lead was "the major reason condors were in such trouble" is, perhaps, overstated. The roller coaster of successes and setbacks is dramatically presented. And the picture of condors as intelligent, curious, observant, and patient is well drawn. A deficiency is the lack of sources cited, either at the end of chapters or at the end of the text (or within the text). One notable feature is the appendix, "Where to View Condors," that includes useful information about appropriate condor viewing etiquette. A second appendix lists Condor Web Sites; but, curiously, the URLs for the Los Ange- les Zoo (http://www.lazoo.org/condorall/) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (http://www.fws.g0v/endangered/i/BOG. html) are missing. From the start of the captive breeding program, both of these organizations have played a major role in the condor story. The index also seems to be missing some obvious entries, such 392 Natural Areas journal Volume 27 (4), 2007</page><page sequence="2">as double-clutching, recovery team, or recovery goals. A population graph, or table with some statistics, would be a useful addition. The author, a birder and science writer, is clearly writing to a general audience, and he does not assume the readers have any prior knowledge of California condor life history. Adequate information is given so that the reader can understand the issues presented. The story is presented as a kind of parable. "The battle to save our largest bird means so much to so many people partly because the condor symbolizes the grief and longing for all that has been lost. The bird provokes strong emotions not because the troubles besetting the condor are so rare, but because they are so com- mon" (p. 38). Although he does not draw a gloomy picture, Moir concludes the introduction with the "hope that by saving this ancient bird, we can save ourselves" (p. xv). Reviewed by: Diane L.
