<plain_text><page sequence="1">Chroniques The Royal Tombs of Zhongshan (c. 310BC) Towards the end of the eighth century BC, a group of people who are described as the White Di (Bai di) made their way into the northern part of China, to the east of the Taihang mountains. They settled in lands that were suited to stock-breeding, and in the course of years they extended their influence and esta- blished a tribal confederacy. From c. 530 BC or even earlier this was known under the name Xianyu, and it is likely that the settlers conti- nued to practise a pastoral way of life. Between 515 and 510 the group was attacked by the growing state of Zhao, but its unity was re-affirmed, and from at least 492 it came to be known under the title of Zhongshan. This was a small dukedom and then kingdom, measu- ring some 100 by 50 kilometres, situated to the southwest of modern Beijing (fig. 1). During the fifth century it was governed by a number of rulers, until it was attacked and destroyed by Wei (409) . On its re- establishment after a short interval, the seat of government was moved to the site of Lingshou ; the kingdom survived until 296, when it was destroyed by a combi- nation of the neighbouring kingdoms of Zhao, Qi and Yan. During the Spring and Autumn and War- ring States periods (722-221 BC) Zhongshan had never been more than a small and some- what weak state, and information about its history and cultural standard has been scant. This situation changed radically with the exca- vations that had been started in Pingshan county (Hebei province) in 1974 and which revealed traces of the site of Lingshou itself and a high standard of cultural attainment on the part of some of its inhabitants. The results of the excavations have been described in a series of articles in the Chinese periodicals, and some of the more choice items that were found on the site were exhibited to the public in Tokyo (March to May 1981) and Paris (November 1984 to February 1985). It is thanks entirely to the written accounts of the excavation and the splendid catalogues that accompanied the exhibitions that it is possible to draw attention to some of the main features of Zhongshan and its culture1. The fourth century BC city of Lingshou was Fig. 1. China circa 350 B.C. - La Chine circa 350 avant notre ère (Catalogue Zhongshan , Paris). Fig. 2.

Bronze inscriptions vessels found at the site. - Inscriptions sur des récipients en bronze découverts in situ (Wenwu, 1979 , i, p. 20). built in a roughly rectangular shape that was not strictly oriented to the points of the compass (fig. 2). Parts of the walls, which ran for roughly 4 kilometres north to south and 3 kilometres east to west, were built to a thickness of 27 metres, being constructed in the typical Chinese method of tamped earth. While a great deal of scope remains for further excavation, attention may be directed to two sets of tombs, out of a total of at least thirty graves. One group (including M 1 and M 2) lies outside the city walls, on the west side ; the second group (M 3, M 4, M 5, and M 6) is situated within the walls, at the southwestern corner. Over 50 inscribed bronze vessels were found in tomb M 1, many of which give the dates or other details of manufacture. On two of the vessels, that are of particularly great 130</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 4.

It is thanks to evidence of this type that the tomb may be identified as that of king Cuo, who was buried in c. 310 BC. The inscriptions (fig. 3) allude to a few events that are known from literary evidence, and make it possible for the first time to draw up a complete list of the dukes and kings of Zhongshan. King Cuo's successor fled to Qi and died there in 299 ; his successor was exiled to the west, and the pre-imperial kingdom of Zhongshan was brought to an end in 296. Some furthers features of the inscriptions are of interest. First, one includes a reference to heaven's bestowal of its mandate to the king- dom2 ; application of this doctrine to kings of the Warring States period is somewhat rare. Secondly, some of the texts may have been intended to act as a warning against the possibility that an ambitious statesman might intrigue to gain control of the kingdom, in the same way as had been done recently in the neighbouring kingdom of Yan. Much of the phraseology and contents of these texts evokes that of writings associated with the tradition of Zhou. Tomb M 1 also included an artifact of a type hitherto not seen elsewhere in China3 (fig. 4). This is a bronze plaque, measuring 94 x 48 X 1 cm, inlaid with gold and silver and carrying on it an architectural plan for the construction of a complex of five tombs and their ceremonial halls. The dimensions are specified for each one of the component buildings and the surrounding walls, on a scale of 1 : 500. The purpose of each one of the principal buildings is duly stated; and the plaque includes the text of a royal decree ordering the preparation of the mausoleum, and the retention of the plan in two copies - one to be buried on the site, and one to be kept in the royal treasury, Careful comparison of the dimensions and other information given on the plan with the traces that have been excavated on the site reveal how accurately the royal commands were obeyed. However, of the five main structures that were intended, only two were actually erected. It is possible that the other three edifices and tombs that had been planned were intended for members of the royal family who were still living at the time when the kingdom was overtaken and forced to flee elsewhere. The information contained on the architec- tural plan makes possible a re-construction of the whole edifice, had it ever been completed (fig. 5 ) . The five main structures were designed as halls of worship that surmounted the tomb chambers. The height of the five was varied, rising to an apex in the centre, and thus giving a pyramidical appearance. The purpose of the four smaller chambers (fig. 6) built in the north side, i.e. at the rear, has not been determined for certain. The site was to be surrounded by an inner and outer wall, with the total enclosure measuring 1900 x 885 feet (Zhongshan units), i.e. 475 X 220 metres. Many of the details of construction of the buildings may be suggested from the material evidence (e.g. tiling) found on the site, by comparison with what is known of contemporary structures (e.g., the royal palace of the pre-imperial kingdom of Qin)4, and from a few illustrations of buildings that form decorative features on bronzes. A series of small auxiliary chambers were built clustering round both M 1 and M 6 (fig. 7)5. Some of these were made for the burial of other persons such as minor consorts, and it is evident that these had died naturally, and not by acts of immolation to accompany the main personage who was buried. Some of the other chambers, which had acted as store- houses for valuable items, had been subject to robbery. At the south side of M 1, two rectangular elongated pits contained horses and carriages, with no less than 12 animals being buried in one. Possibly uniquely, ano- ther of the auxiliary chambers had been built to include one small and three large boats, constructed with iron hoops and lead fittings ; this chamber had been robbed on two occa- sions.

Three-pronged symbolical instruments of royal power. - Instruments en forme de trident symbolisant le pouvoir royal (H. 119 cm) (Zhongshan, fig. 1). While M 1 and M 6 have been excavated fully, it has not yet been possible to investigate the other tombs in as detailed a way as is desirable. Both M 1 and M 6 had been designed on much the same plan, oriented almost directly to the north, with long integral cause- ways at the northern and southern sides. The central coffin chamber was formed of walls of tamped earth that had been plastered, and the sides had been stepped. The size of these chambers, surmounted in the case of M 1 by the hall of worship, is impressive ; they mea- sured 15 X 13.5 metres and 13 x 12 metres respectively. The identification of these two sites as royal tombs depends in the first instance on the inscriptions, and it is supported by the type of artifacts and style of goods that had been buried. Attention is due in this connection to the three-pronged instruments of bronze that may perhaps be explained as part of the regalia of Zongshan6. These striking objects may well have acted as symbols of royal power that could be set up on poles so as to display the king's majesty and proclaim it to a distance. Extending as they did to a height of 1.19 me- tres, they can hardly have failed to be impres- sive (fig. 8). Five of these instruments were found in M 1 ; altogether six had been buried in M 6. In addition, both tombs included a series of nine tripods, nine being the entitlement reserved for leaders who had assumed the title of king (wang). It is open to speculation whether the three-pronged instruments owed their origin to influences from the steppe, rather than from Chinese culture. Other traces of such an influence may possibly be seen in the careful burial of two large dogs, beautifully dressed with jewelled collars7. The royal tombs of Zhongshan included some of the most exquisite examples of Chi- nese metallurgy yet to unearthed. A series of bronze animals, with delicate gold and silver inlay, is particularly remarkable in this connec- tion, owing to their vivid and lively form and their polished finish8. These included mythical winged animals ; a tiger shown in the act of devouring a deer, a rhinoceros and an ox, and it has been suggested that the sockets planted on the back of these animals were intended to hold the wooden supports of a screen. In each case the sinuous curves of the animals, their markings and their expressions call for admi- ration (fig. 9). The same standard of crafts- manship is exemplified in a further artifact from M 1 that is now regarded as being too delicate to tolerate transport. This is a table made of bronze with gold and silver inlay (fig. 10) ; the top (47.5 X 47 cm) is supported by four dragons and four phoenixes, and there are four deer at the base (total height : 36.2 cm)9. It may be observed that the style and quality of these objects is reminiscent of some others, e.g. a set of leopards and a hill-censer, found nearby at the Han site of Mancheng. They were buried in the tomb of the Han king of Zhongshan who died in 113 BC10. Two remarkable lamps form further exam- ples of the high standard of artistry attained by craftsmen during the Warring States period11. One of these (66.4 cm high) which was found in M 6 takes the form of a central human figure, whose outstretched arms support two columns ; these carry three dishes that act as lamp-holders (fig. 11). The columns are for- med of snakes, and the central human figure is dressed in formal robes with trailing sleeves and ornamental headgear. The head of the figure is made of silver, and the mask-like appearance of the face suggests that the figure portrays a shaman or an actor. The second lamp (82.9 cm high), which was found in the tomb of king Cuo, is of a type that is seen not infrequently, in the form of a tree. From the central pole or trunk a succession of branches spring out, each one ending in the cup needed for a lamp. The example is exceptional owing to the quality of its finish and the inclusion of a snake, birds and monkeys that decorate the whole structure and its fifteen lamps. The tombs of Zhongshan include a profu- sion of other objects many of which merit closer inspection. In the embarras de richesse it is possible to point to some miniature jade figurines, and elegant trappings used for horse and carriage12. In addition, tomb M 3, which lies within the precincts of Lingshou and has been partly excavated, yielded two of the most beautiful and highly ornate liubo boards that have ever been seen. Liubo was a game of chance, possibly used as a means of divination Fig. 9.

Usually the boards needed for the game are shown with the simplest possible markings, i.e. the linear TLV pattern that also appears on a certain type of bronze mirror of the Han period13. The two examples of Liubo boards (45 x 40 cm) from Zhongshan were made of stone (fig. 12). The linear markings lie enmeshed within a whole series of decorative devices, executed with a consummate skill that exploits the different colouring of the basic material of which they were made. Little or nothing can be known for certain of the circumstances in which artists and crafts- men worked in Zhongshan, or of the techno- logy practised there during the centuries of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. There is however one immediate contrast that may be noticed. The items that are characterised by detailed and beautiful workmanship such as those that have been mentioned above are in almost every way different from most of the large number of bronzes that were found at the same sites, and which may be described as heavy, or even crude. Many of these latter are almost entirely devoid of decorative embellishment, and the standard of their finish can only be described as poor, when compared with both earlier and later examples from many parts of China. Two features have attracted most attention among these vessels ; first, the preservation of the original wine or spirit in liquid form in two items ; and secondly the inclusion of a bird, with spread wings, in the centre of some large flat basins14. The question therefore arises of the prove- nance of both of these types of artifact. It may be asked whether the kingdom of Zhongshan included among its inhabitants, who could not have been all that numerous, some highly skilled artists and craftsmen, who were respon- sible for the beautiful animals and their inlay, and the two lampstands with their intricate embellishment, or whether these objects were brought in from another centre. Likewise, were the rather poor bronzes the product of Zhongshan or had they been imported from a centre that was engaged in production on a large scale ? It may perhaps be suggested that there is some indication that the area of Zhongshan itself was the home of a speciality in the highly refined workmanship that pro- duced the best articles of the site, whatever the origin of the more crude pieces may have been. The dukedom and kingdom of Zhongshan had never been more than a small enclave surrounded by the powerful states of Zhao, Qi and Yan that eventually overcame it. The state played no significant part in the political manoeuvres of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, and has little call to historical fame. That the site of a minor centre, which did not last for a very long period in independence, nonetheless yielded a total of 19,000 artifacts, including some of such high quality, would be surprising were it not for the diversity and dispersal of Chinese artistic and cultural talent that we have come to expect for the centuries in question. It is not impossible that it was the fine examples of the bronze- smith's work that were made within Zhong- shan, and that the cruder wares were imported from elsewhere, e.g. from a centre where bronze foundries are known to have flourished since long before the Warring States period. In this connection, it may be noted that there are proportionately more examples of exquisite workmanship at this site than at many others, and this might suggest, prima facie the esta- blishment and maintenance of a local tradi- tion. In addition, some measure of continuity may perhaps be discerned in the subsequent history of the area, to the extent that a specialised artistic tradition lived on, when the locality formed an integral part of the Han empire. During the Han period, the name Zhong- shan re-appears as the title of a kingdom. Set up in 1 54 BC, this lasted with some break until AD 8, one of its kings acceding as Pingdi in 1 BC ; during Later Han, there was a kingdom of Zhongshan from 25 to 174. The Han king- dom was situated in much the same area as its predecessor, being roughly rectangular in shape; it measured c. 125 kilometres from north to south and 50 kilometres from east to west, between 38 and 39 degrees north, and 114 and 116 degrees east. Archaeology has revealed some indications of the maintenance of a cultural tradition in the area during the Han period. Reference has been made above to some of the bronze, with gold and silver inlay, wares found at the site of Mancheng (115 degrees 15 minutes east, 38 degrees, 59 minutes north; approximately 150 kilometres north- east of the sites of Pingshan). They bear features in common with some of the finds from the graves of the Warring States kings. It will be recalled that it was at Mancheng that a Han king of Zhongshan, who died in 1 13 BC had been buried, wrapped in a suit of jade Fig. 12. Liubo (gaming) board, with TLV pattern ; stone. - Jeu de liubo avec thèmes dits « en TLV» ; pierre (44,9 X 40,1 cm) (Zhongshan, fig. 45). 133</page><page sequence="5">pieces ; it was from the same site that another excellent example was found of a lamp made in anthropomorphic form15. In addition, two golden ingots, rarely seen in Former Han sites, have been found there and close by (i.e. in Mancheng xian and in Yi xian)16. For a somewhat later stage, we may turn to tomb no. 40 Ding xian (Hebei province), some 80 kilometres north-east of Pingshan and 70 kilometres south-west of Mancheng. This tomb included a considerable number of jade vessels and ornaments, and a jade suit made for another king of Zhongshan ; he is identified variously as Liu Xiu, who died in 55 BC, or Liu Xing, who died in 8 BC. The finds are said to manifest a highly developed attainment in jade working. The cultural standard of the occupant of the tomb and his people may also be shown by the inclusion of a large number of wooden and bamboo strips, some of which carried the text of the Lunyu17. Finally, attention should be drawn to tomb no. 43 Ding xian. This tomb likewise included fragments of a jade suit, and it has been identified as that of the last king of Zhongshan, who died in AD 174. At least one of the items found there testifies to the conti- nuation of a high standard of artistry ; this is a screen (16.5 x 15.3 X 6.5 cm) carefully worked in jade, portraying the Queen Mother of the West and the King Father of the East18. From the earliest identified tomb, of c. 3 10 BC until AD 174, the little kingdom of Zhongshan clearly set a high value on beautifully designed and executed objects. 1 .
