<plain_text><page sequence="1">CULTURE AND THE CAUSES OF CULTURE By PHILIP H. BAGBY IN A recent issue of this journal Coulborn (1952) has reopened the question of the causes of culture, which has been discussed in these pages sporadic- ally-and one might say inconclusively-during the last decade. As one re- reads these articles (Bidney 1944, 1946; Kroeber 1948a., 1951; Strong 1948; Radcliffe-Brown 1949), it is hard not to feel as if one were grappling with phantoms which slip away as soon as one tries to grasp them. It seems likely that, as so often happens, the main difficulty lies, not in the nature of the problem itself, but in the vague and loose way in which we customarily make use of words. Perhaps if we could define such basic concepts as "level," "cul- ture" and "cause" a little more precisely than we are accustomed to do, we would find that at least some of our difficulties had been removed and that the problem had been clarified, if not solved. Science is by definition orderly knowledge and each particular science must therefore deal with some particular type of order which man has discovered in the universe which surrounds him. It is customary to say that a science deals with "regularities" or "correlations" of phenomena and these terms are only another way of referring to the orderly aspects of our experience. Such regularities may be concurrent or successive, synchronic or diachronic; that is to say, two or more phenomena may appear together (roughly) at the same time or in a regular temporal sequence. Moreover, such regularities, though often directly observable, are nevertheless in a sense abstracted from the total flux of phenomena. The objects of ordinary discourse, for instance: tables, chairs, dogs, cats, human beings and so on, are all abstractions of this kind; they are concurrent regularities which happen also to be continuous in space and time. We take a number of phenomena which regularly (and continuously) appear together-a flat hard surface resting on tall, thin legs, for instance-and con- sider them apart from other surrounding or interpenetrating phenomena which change. Because these groups of phenomena are continuous in space and time, because they reflect light and are resistant to the touch, we think of them as being in some sense concrete; they are nonetheless abstractions from the total experience which alone deserves to be called fully concrete. Some of the sciences-biology and geology, for instance-deal in large measure with concurrent regularities similar to the objects of ordinary dis- course; for this reason they tend to be largely descriptive and classificatory. But in the more refined of the physical sciences, which deal only with certain measurable aspects of phenomena, we may have concurrent regularities which are discontinuous in space such as the phenomena of gravitation. All the sciences deal with successive regularities if they can find any; we have the 535</page><page sequence="2">536 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [55, 1953 laws of growth in biology and the laws of mechanics in physics. Occasionally we may even find successive regularities which are discontinuous in time; nuclear radiation is an excellent example. It must be stressed, however, that all such regularities are equally abstract and for that matter equally concrete in any epistemological sense. Here and there in the sciences we may find objects which are not directly observable-electrons in physics, for instance, or genes in biology. These are generally called hypothetical constructs; we cannot really know whether they exist or not but they are extremely useful as a means of referring. to or explain- ing broad sets of regularities which are observable. It is important to note however that they do not necessarily represent any further degree of abstrac- tion. The type or types (class or classes in the terminology of modern logic) of abstraction with which each science deals is usually called its subject- matter and these subject-matters may be related to each other in a number of different ways, as a cursory inspection of the various sciences will show. One of the sciences may include another as biology includes zoology, or it may ex- clude another while remaining a branch of the more general science, as zoology excludes botany but remains a branch of biology. It would be more exact to say that it is the subject-matters of these various sciences which include or exclude one another rather than the sciences themselves, but as long as we realize this there is no harm in using the shorter and easier form of speech. One science may include or exclude another then, but if precisely defined, one science should not overlap another. That this is not always possible is shown by the existence of various borderline disciplines such as physical chemistry or biochemistry. Sometimes one science will deal with the gross aspects of certain phenomena while another will deal with smaller aspects, and the first is by no means always reducible to the second. More often than we should like, the subject-matters of two sciences are simply incommensurable with one another; the two classes of abstractions are defined so differently that no relationship can be established between them. The concept of "level" seems to represent an attempt to fit this fact of incommensurability into a general world picture. Although similar notions may be found in Aristotle-his theory of the four kinds of souls, for instance- their reappearance in the nineteenth century appears to be connected with the evolutionary ideas prevailing at that time. What Comte was trying to do was to fit the subject-matters of the various sciences into certain larger classes which would be fully homogeneous internally, though incommensurable with each other. The sciences were then thought to be related to each other genetic- ally, a more complex science rising from a simpler one by a process inherent in human thought. From a practical scientific standpoint, such inherent or necessary dialectical processes-laws of thought discovered by pure thought</page><page sequence="3">BAGBY] CULTURE AND THE CAUSES OF CULTURE 537 -can only be considered as highly suspect. Later thinkers supposed that this evolutionary process took place not only in the realm of thought, but also in actuality, the world of biology having evolved out of the world of physics and so on. This latter theory is suggestive and may have some basis in fact, but it cannot be said to have been proved or to have solved the question of incom- mensurability as it sets out to do. For one thing, what we are talking about are abstractions and it seems to be inherent in the process of abstracting that we can make diverse and incommensurable abstractions from the same set of phenomena. Moreover, even within the levels which have been proposed there has been a stubborn persistence of incommensurability. Einstein, for instance, has tried and failed to establish any satisfactory relationship between the large-scale phenomena with which the theory of relativity deals and the subject-matters of the other branches of physics. In psychology too there seems to be an inherent gap between its two main branches, the study of individual personality and the study of human nature in general, which Allport (1938: 22), following Windelband, has distinguished as the "idiographic" and the "nomothetic" branches of that science. If we were to venture into these treacherous metaphysical quicksands, we might guess that the co- existence of diverse and irreducible types of order is inherent in the structure of the universe, and that divergent types of order may have evolved separately much in the same way as there seem to have been divergent lines of biological and cultural evolution. But this can only be a guess at best. What does seem to be useful and worth retaining in the concept of "level" is the notion that some classes of abstractions are commensurable and others not. As we shall show later, culture, the subject-matter of cultural anthro- pology is commensurable with the subject-matters of certain other sciences but is not commensurable with still others. Before demonstrating this, how- ever, we shall need a fairly tight and homogeneous definition of culture. As for the term "level," we might conceivably retain it to refer to any of the more general classes of abstractions which include all mutually com- mensurable abstractions of a single kind. But the word has come to be used so loosely to cover all sorts of classes (or classes of classes) of abstractions that confusion would inevitably follow any attempt to restrict its meaning. We had best take "level" to mean any class of abstractions whatsoever, while we can refer to the more general classes of all mutually commensurable abstractions as "homogeneous fields of enquiry." Our next task then will be to construct a precise and homogeneous defini- tion of culture. We do not need to review all the literature on the subject since we are not trying (as some authors have done) to construct a synthetic def- inition which would include or imply all that is believed about culture. On the contrary, what we need is the smallest possible number of indices which</page><page sequence="4">538 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [55, 1953 will enable us to recognize an abstraction as belonging or not belonging to the particular class of abstractions we call "culture." Perhaps the broadest description of culture to be found in the literature is the phrase: "what men think, what they do and what they make." This description can hardly be called a definition; it is far from homogeneous. In fact it includes three quite different classes of objects or abstractions: mental events, behavior and material objects. Let us see if we cannot reduce them to a single class. As far as material objects are concerned the task is easy. Most anthro- pologists would agree that what they are interested in is not the material objects themselves, but how they are altered and used by human beings, that is, the behavior of human beings towards them. Material objects are only useful to the anthropologist or the archeologist as evidence of how human beings behaved in the past; they tell us about behavior which can no longer be directly observed. Such objects also give some evidence as to the ideas and feelings, the mental events of our forebears. But in either case, material ob- jects can be eliminated from our definition. We are left then with the two other categories, mental events and behavior; it will not prove so easy to reconcile them. Most anthropologists would wish to keep both categories and would maintain that an understanding of the contrast between idea and action, between theory and practice, is essential to the interpretation of any particular aspect of culture. Nevertheless, for our present purposes we need a homogeneous definition. Let us see if we cannot obtain it without losing this important distinction. Mental events are not usually, of course, directly observable; their exist- ence is customarily deduced from observation of behavior. We can observe them directly in ourselves by that curious process known as introspection and we are undoubtedly justified in supposing that they also exist in others. For the purposes of this article, however, we can assume a behavioristic posi- tion and take such words as "ideas," "feelings" et. cetera as only a shorthand way of referring to certain configurations of behavior, the same configurations which in another context we would regard as constituting the evidence for the existence of certain mental events. In this way we shall have succeeded in reducing our three categories to one. The distinction between theory and practice we would now regard as a difference between verbal behavior and other behavior, a point of view which is enshrined in such popular expressions as "Do what I say and not what I do." Our procedure will seem all the more justified if we consider certain recent developments in psychology. The psychoanalysts and the dynamic psycholo- gists in fact have taught us that all behavior must be regarded as evidence for some sort of mental event, conscious or unconscious. The contrast between theory and practice they would regard not as a contrast between mental event</page><page sequence="5">BAGBY] CULTURE AND THE CAUSES OF CULTURE 539 and behavior, but as a contrast between conscious and unconscious mental events or between superego and id. We might of course follow their lead and Sdefine culture as being entirely composed of mental events. But then we should be including, without any overweening necessity, a large number of inferential constructs, the so-called unconscious mental events. We shall do better to stick to behavior which we can observe, and leave mental events out of our considerations entirely. We have thus reduced our three categories to one. Culture is behavior. But surely not any kind of behavior. If so, we should be unable to distinguish the respective subject-matters of cultural anthropology and behavioristic psychology. Culture must be some particular kind of behavior or some par- ticular aspect of behavior. To discover what kind we might turn to one of the oldest and still widely quoted definitions of culture. Tylor uses the expression: "acquired by man as a member of society." This lapidary phrase seems to have fused two distinct criteria: first, that the kind of behavior we call culture has certain origins or causes; second, that it is similar to the behavior of other members of the society of which an individual happens to be a member. This first criterion rather begs the question as to the causes of culture (as do certain more recent definitions in terms of learning theory) and had therefore best be eliminated. We are left with the second criterion: culture is behavior similar to the behavior of other members of some particular society. Yet there seems to be something wrong with this definition. Like so many other so-called definitions it points to the general area of enquiry rather than to the specific type of order in which we are interested. Surely it is not the particular acts of behavior as such that interest us, it is their similarity. Having abstracted from the flux the configurations we call behavior, we must now go further and abstract from behavior the configurations we call simi- larities. We can now make our provisional definition of culture read as follows: "Culture is similarities of behavior in the members of a particular society." We are not only interested, however, when all members of a society behave alike; the anthropologist is also concerned if they behave differently but in a regular fashion. If the men in a society all wear trousers and the women all wear skirts, that is surely culture. It is culture too if the king wears a crown and his subjects do not. To cover these and similar instances, we had best use the word "regularities" instead of "similarities," the latter being included in the former as a limiting case. Our provisional definition would then be amended to read: "Culture is regularities of behavior in the members of a particular society." (I seem to recall having seen a similar definition in one of the works of Margaret Mead, but have been unable to find the precise passage.) The difference between "regular behavior" and "regularities of behavior" is a subtle and yet an extremely important one which has often been over- looked or slurred in anthropological literature. We often speak loosely as if</page><page sequence="6">540 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [55, 1953 some single act of behavior-Dick's drinking coffee at 8:15 on the morning of March 22nd, for instance-were culture, but it is really the similarity of this act (or its regular relationship) to the acts of other members of the same so- ciety that concerns the anthropologist. The individual act indeed cannot be the subject of any science; it does not of itself exhibit any order or regularity which science can study. Standing alone it belongs to the domain of history or perhaps of biography. Cultural anthropology, however, insofar as it aspires to be a science, must deal with some sort of regularity; our definition of culture makes clear that it does deal with certain specific regularities and that its claim to be a science is therefore fully merited. We now have a precise and homogeneous definition of culture. But our difficulties are not yet at an end. We are still in considerable danger of having our subject-matter overlap the subject-matters of several other sciences. Physiology for instance deals not only with regularities of structure in human bodies, but also with regularities of function (that is, of behavior) insofar as they seem to be clearly inherent in physiological structure. Eating, for instance, is behavior common to all members of all societies and under our definition this regularity as it occurs in each particular society would be a part of the culture of that society. But anthropologists commonly prefer to regard the mere fact that all members of a society are accustomed to consume nutritious substances as a physiological matter; it is the particular ways in which this universal human tendency is modified in particular societies that interest them. The nomothetic branch of psychology also purports to deal with regu- larities of behavior in the members of all societies; its subject-matter is usually known as "human nature." In practice, of course, Western psychologists have tended more often than not to discover regularities which only hold for members of the Western "higher culture," but we may grant that they have a legitimate field of inquiry which must be distinguished from that of the cul- tural anthropologists. We could exclude the subject-matters of these two branches of science, the functional branch of physiology and the nomothetic branch of psychology, by amending our definition to read: "Culture is regularities of behavior among the members of particular societies but not among members of all societies." But if we were to do so, we would find ourselves having also excluded, in the excess of our zeal, such cultural universals as language. The fact that all men speak some language and that such languages all have phonemic and mor- phemic structures would now become a purely psychological or physiological fact. Perhaps a better method of achieving our purpose-and one more in conformity with common practice-would be to exclude from culture such regularities of behavior as are clearly hereditary in origin. This would have the additional advantage of excluding not only such regularities as psycho- logical functioning and human nature, but also regularities in the behavior of</page><page sequence="7">BAGBY] CULTURE AND THE CAUSES OF CULTURE 541 races. None of these latter have as yet been proven to exist, but on the other hand it is impossible to prove the contrary, that races have no psychological peculiarities whatsoever. While the abuse of unproved racial theories for sinister political ends cannot be denounced too severely, nevertheless racial psychology must always remain at least a potential form of science and there- fore its domain must also be distinguished from that of anthropology. The realm of culture, then, is constituted by regularities (other than those which are clearly hereditary) in the behavior of members of particular so- cieties, a society being here defined simply as a group of people who interact with one another more than they do with outsiders (see Kluckhohn 1950: 31). Much of the ground covered in reaching this definition is of course familiar to all anthropologists and its value lies not in any novel features but in its pre- cision and homogeneity. These virtues should enable us to give much clearer and more logical consideration to the question of causes. Before going on we should stress the fact that the regularities which the anthropologist studies are just as real as the subjects of the other sciences or indeed as the objects of ordinary discourse. If we had defined culture in terms of some such hypothetical construct as values we should be on shaky ground, but we have defined it in terms of behavior and no one doubts the reality of behavior. It is true that cultural regularities are not continuous in space or even always continuous in time like tables and chairs, and it is only on the rare occasion-watching -the crowd at a football game or looking down on a landscape from an airplane-that we can embrace some aspect of culture or its effects in a single sweeping glance; but culture is nevertheless an observable aspect of the phenomenal universe and therefore perfectly real. Insofar as it is divisible into separate items, these items are real entities. Of course, it is true that culture has no substance; it is composed of forms and nothing more. But in the view of almost all modern philosophers, idealists as well as positiv- ists, this is equally true of everything else. There was no need for Kroeber to make his famous recantation (1948a.:407-408); to object to the reification of culture is to object to talking about it at all. We need not claim that the definition we have now arrived at will turn out to be the best in every context. It does have, however, the advantage of clari- fying the relationship between cultural anthropology and certain neighboring sciences such as sociology, cultural history, and cultural psychology. If we try to construct a definition of the subject-matter of sociology along the same lines as our definition of culture, we find that sociology deals with regularities (again excluding clearly hereditary ones) in the behavior of members of the same society towards one another. An item of behavior directed towards another human being is what the sociologists call an "act" or a "social action"; the reciprocal patterning of such acts in roles and institutions constitutes "social relations," "social organization," "social systems," or even "society,"</page><page sequence="8">542 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [55, 1953 where we mean by "society" more than a simple aggregate of interacting persons. The word "society," it should be noted, appears to have two different senses which are often confused: (1) an organized (or regularly interacting) group of persons, and (2) the organization (or regularities of interaction) of a group of persons. Insofar as sociology is a science, it deals with society in the second sense and not the first. The subject-matter of sociology then is a part of culture, and sociology, in a strict hierarchy of sciences, would be a branch of cultural anthropology. No doubt social relations form the largest and in some ways the most important part of culture; almost every instance of human behavior contains some reference, direct or indirect, to other human beings. Even hermits, it is said, constantly seek the approval of their fellows. Historically, of course, sociology has developed as a comparative study of social institutions in our own or closely related societies, while the anthro- pologist, in dealing with small non-literate societies has had to study all the branches of culture, including social institutions, at the same time. For these historical reasons each of the two sciences has developed its own vocabulary and its own techniques; it is often difficult to coordinate or reconcile them. But this does not mean that society and culture constitute two different levels of abstraction or two different realms of existence, as has often been supposed. On the contrary, social organization is a part of culture and nothing more. Just as economics, for all its elaborate and refined methodology, is merely a special branch of sociology, so sociology in turn must be subsumed under cultural anthropology. The relationship between history and anthropology, however, is not quite so simple. Indeed, much of what is called history is not science at all. Historians deal primarily with individual human events-important events as they have occurred in the past in literate societies. They seek, first of all, to describe these events in their full individuality, without trying to find any regularity or order in them. Inevitably, of course, being subject to the general human love of regularity, historians do tend to suggest or imply the existence of certain patterns of regular change, but they have rarely tried to establish the existence of these patterns on any firm rational basis. And when they have tried they have usually failed. In the last century or so, however, contemporary with the rise of sociology and anthropology, there have appeared new kinds of history, cultural or social, which deal with regularities in the behavior of members of particular literate societies in the past. Since these new branches of history deal with regularities, they may properly be called sciences; and since they deal with cultural or social regularities, they are all clearly branches of cultural anthropology. History is a science, then, only insofar as its domain overlaps the domain of anthropology. Cultural anthropology, then, includes sociology and the cultural and social branches of history; we shall see that its domain also overlaps the domain of</page><page sequence="9">BAGBY] CULTURE AND THE CAUSES OF CULTURE 543 psychology. The psychologist studies primarily the regularities of behavior (and thought as evidenced by behavior) in a single human being. These regularities are conceptualized as habits, mannerisms, personality traits, et. cetera. The sum of the regularities exhibited by an individual is known as his personality, and the whole field is usually known as that of personality studies. We may think of each man or woman as being subject to his own laws (if we wish to borrow that much-abused term from the physical sciences) which apply only within the spatial and temporal limits of his behavior. But some of these regularities are reproduced (under a given set of circumstances) in all human beings or at least in all of a particular sex and age, and here the psychologist is able to formulate more general laws or regularities, which are thought of as being somehow hereditary in origin, as forming part of human nature. The psychologist would no doubt willingly exclude from his domain such features of behavior as are clearly derived by imitation, or reaction, from the behavior of others. He would prefer to retain only those which are clearly innate, but often he finds it impossible to make a clear distinction. Moreover, as a matter of practice the psychologist finds it most convenient to investigate the behavior of members of his own society; thus it is easy for him to mistake cultural regu- larities for general laws of human nature. It will in all likelihood prove im- possible ever to provide a complete cross-cultural check for every psychologi- cal generalization and therefore the boundaries between cultural anthropology and nomothetic psychology will probably always remain somewhat fuzzy. But we may hope that they will grow somewhat sharper in the course of time. This is not, however, the only way in which anthropology and psychology overlap. Some personality traits are found, not in all mankind and not only in a single human being, but in all or most of the members of a single society. This kind of regularity is what has traditionally been called "national char- acter"; more recently it has been dubbed "basic personality structure" by Kardiner and "modal personality" by DuBois (1944 chap. 1). No doubt, as Kardiner's term indicates, the personality-traits which we find in a single indi- vidual or in the members of a particular society are often thought of as forming a little machine installed at the centre of each human psyche in earliest infancy by the tender ministrations of the parents, just as culture is often thought of as a set of Platonic ideas (ideals, values or standards) floating in the air over the heads of the culture-bearers. But it is dangerous to define an area of study in terms of a type of inferential construct which happens to be in favor at a particular time. In both psychology and anthropology all we can observe is behavior or its material effects; and therefore our definitions had best be in terms of behavior. Now the regular appearance of certain personality traits in the members of a particular society is clearly culture according to our definition; equally clearly it is most easily studied by psychologists or by anthropologists trained</page><page sequence="10">544 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [55, 1953 in psychological techniques and since it deals with personality its study is also a branch of psychology. Modal personality or national character therefore is a part of culture and not, as some have imagined, the source of culture. Motives on the one hand and values on the other are inferential constructs derived from the same set of observed regularities; it is not surprising that they should show a close correspondence for any given society. Nor do we need to introduce any causal mechanism to explain this correspondence. This argument is a bit difficult to follow without a specific example. Let us take some tribe, the Hopi for example, who rarely quarrel with each other or fight with strangers. We might say that their behavior is peaceful. Insofar as this is a regularity of behavior in individual Hopi it is a trait of their indi- vidual personalities and falls within the domain of psychology; but insofar as this personality trait is regularly reproduced in the behavior of most Hopi it is an aspect of their culture. Using the same behavior as evidence, we may think of each Hopi as having a low or repressed motive or instinct for aggres- sion, installed by his parents in his psyche by precept, example or punishment. Or alternatively, we may think of each Hopi as possessing the value "peace." But we do not need to explain the value "peace" as being caused by the repres- sion of the aggressive instinct, since the behavior in each case is identical. Basic personality structure is not the cause of culture or vice versa; it is culture or a construct based on culture. All we really have observed is that the Hopis are peaceful and teach their children to be peaceful; in other words that culture or this aspect of it is learned, which is not really a very surprising dis- covery (cf. similar views in Spiro 1951). There is, of course, a legitimate use of psychology to explain culture, but we shall return to that later. For the present let us be satisfied to observe that there is a field in which anthropology and psychology overlap, something simi- lar to such borderline sciences as physical chemistry and biochemistry. This particular branch of learning has been called "Culture and Personality" or "Personality in Culture" (Kluckhohn and Mowrer 1944: 1), but there is some- thing awkward in using a conjunction or a preposition in the name of a science. Perhaps the best name would be "cultural psychology," as Kroeber has sug- gested (1948b. chap. 15). Our definition of culture, then, has helped us to understand the relations of anthropology with sociology, history and psychology; perhaps it will also help us to clarify the question of the causes of culture. But first of all we must try to understand what it is that we mean by a cause. In common practice and in common speech when we point to some phe- nomenon as the "cause" of some other phenomenon, what we do is to select some antecedent feature of the total situation which we and our interlocutors know to have also occurred in other similar situations. When a house burns down, we note that there was a thunderstorm shortly before and we surmise</page><page sequence="11">BAGBY] CULTURE AND THE CAUSES OF CULTURE 545 that it must have been struck by lightning, as has happened many times just before a house caught fire. Being struck by lightning was, we say, the cause of the destruction of the house. We do not customarily hunt for all the recurrent features of the situation, but we are quite willing to admit them if some one points them out. We would accept as additional causes the fact that the house had no lightning-rod, that it was built of wood, had not been painted for several years, was empty, isolated, and so on. But usually we mention as causes those antecedent features of a situation which are particularly striking or could have been altered by human agency. A cause, then, is an antecedent feature of some recurrent process. It is true that we often imagine that there has been some sort of flow of energy from cause to effect; the billiard cue, we feel, pushes the billiard ball. It is probable that here we are merely projecting into our image of the situation the feeling of effort we have when we intervene actively in nature; we think of the muscu- lar tension which we discharge in pushing the billiard cue as flowing through the cue into the ball. But, as Hume showed conclusively long ago, we can never observe any connection or flow between cause and effect; all that we can prove is their recurrence as part of a regularly recurrent sequence of events. It is perhaps this anthropomorphic element in the notion of cause which has led to its being tacitly abandoned in the more developed sciences. The physicist scarcely can be said to look for causes any more; he seeks to observe regular concomitant variations in measurable aspects of physical phenomena. The biologist, too, looks for regularities rather than causes, regularities of structure in genera and species as well as regularities of process in the life- histories of members of particular species. Just as the notion of regular formal structure (or "synchronic regularity") has replaced the Greek notion of an entity composed of matter and form or substance and qualities, so the notion of regular process (or "diachronic regularity") has replaced the simple notion of causality. The concept of regular process is at once broader and more refined than that of cause-and-effect; it includes all that is useful in the older concept and discards its confusing anthropomorphic implications. We could hardly speak of the egg as being the cause of the chicken--there is a continuity of development here such that no sharp line can be drawn between the two "en- tities." Nevertheless, the regular development of chicken from egg is a feature of order in the universe and therefore helps us to understand and explain a mature chicken. When Kroeber (1948b: 411) recommends that the student of culture should content himself with describing sequences of significant forms rather than seek for specific causal explanations, he is in fact proposing that anthropology should follow the.procedure of the older sciences. We might add that such recurrent sequences of phenomena are the only form of "diachronic" explana- tion that science can discover; whatever "causes" in the vulgar sense are em-</page><page sequence="12">546 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [55, 1953 pirically demonstrable will be included as antecedent portions of these regularly recurrent processes. In science, then, the concept of causality has been superseded by the concept of recurrent process or diachronic regularity, and in searching for the causes of a particular cultural phenomenon we should look for recurrent processes which include the phenomenon as one of their terms. Among such processes there will certainly be some which are nothing more than sequences of cultural forms-regular processes of cultural change within a single society such as every anthropologist is familiar with. There will also be processes involving the culture of more than one society-processes which fall under the general headings of diffusion and acculturation. But is this all? Must we hold, as White does (1947) that only culture can be the cause of culture? That we should only look for regularities of process within the domain of culture itself? Surely this is a needlessly restrictive point of view. The recurrent processes for which we are looking may of course include any features of the universe which are commensurate with those features we call culture. Culture has been defined as regularities of behavior in the members of a society (excluding those clearly hereditary). Among the features of our recurrent processes we may now include those same hereditary regularities which we formerly excluded. We can explain certain aspects of culture in terms of physiological needs common to all mankind, such as hunger, and others in terms of universal psychological motives or patterns. Malinowski, for instance, assumed a universal fear of the unknown to explain the universality of religion, and indeed most functional explanation is of this kind. The prevalence of sus- picions of witchcraft among the Zufii has been explained by the "frustration- aggression-projection" formula, a psychological pattern which we find among ourselves and presume to be universal. Culture, then, can be explained (at least in part) by human nature. We can look for regularities of behavior, physi- ological or psychological, common to all mankind which fit into regular pat- terns or processes with the regularities of behavior of the members of a single society. No doubt such explanations can never be completely sufficient; they cannot explain the differences between the cultures of two societies, but they can explain the similarities. In the common physical or physiological structure of mankind we also have a type of regularity common not only to the members of a particular society but also to the members of all societies. The shape and structure of the human foot serves to limit the possible forms of foot-gear; the location and shape of the genitals helps-along with certain presumed universal psychological mo- tives such as modesty and its correlative, sexual exhibitionism-to determine the widespread use of genital coverings and the common aspects of their shape. So far we have mentioned only regularities common to all mankind-</page><page sequence="13">BAGBY] CULTURE AND THE CAUSES OF CULTURE 547 bodily structure and human nature. But there are also regularities of struc- ture (and perhaps of behavior) which are thought to be hereditary and which are shared by large segments of mankind including all the members of particu- lar societies. These are the phenomena known as race. Usually the physical differences of races are too trivial to be used as explanations of culture, but we can imagine that the small stature of pygmies permits them to provide lower roofs for their shelters than we do for our houses, or that if the Hotten- tots were to make chairs, they might invent a special shape to fit steatopygous women. If there are any psychological differences of race-a question which is now neither proved nor disproved-such differences could certainly be used in explaining the culture. The hypothesis that all civilizations were founded by Aryan conquerors is a perfectly legitimate hypothesis, though it happens to have been disproved by the facts. It might conceivably be possible to show that a selected sample of Chinese children, brought up under precisely the same conditions as a sample of European children, nevertheless differed from them psychologically in a uniform way, and such a psychological difference would then help to explain the difference between Chinese civilization and our own. Race, then, must be added to our list of the possible causes or explanations of culture. We seem now to have exhausted the possibilities of regularities in the structure and behavior of large groups of human beings commensurate with those regularities we call culture. But what of the non-human world? Does it not also have regularities commensurate with culture? We do in fact often conceptualize the world around us in just this way. We think of a cer- tain geographical area as having fauna, flora and physical aspects which affect all its inhabitants in a regular way. This is what we call the environment; it might be defined as regularities in the behavior of the non-human world towards the members of a particular society. It differs, of course, from the en- vironment of an individual which is conceived of in such a way that it presents particular features to him and to him alone. If properly conceptualized, then, environment can certainly be included among the possible explanations of culture. How does our list stand now? Culture, we have said, must be explained by the empirical discovery of regularly recurrent processes and among the fea- tures of such processes we may include not only items of culture but other com- mensurate regularities, such as bodily structure, human nature, race (including physiological and psychological factors) and environment. All these of course have commonly been used, implicitly or explicitly, by anthropologists, sociolo- gists and historians in explaining particular features of culture. But what of the other mode of explanation so much favored by historians-the influence of a great man? Can a great man or rather his behavior be said to cause culture? Here the answer must be a firm no. There is an old rule that a cause must be adequate to its effect, and, translated into our own terms, this means that</page><page sequence="14">548 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [55, 1953 the parts of a recurrent process must all be commensurate with one another. They must all be abstractions of one kind-all belong to a "homogeneous field of enquiry." The individual or a particular act of his behavior or some idiogra- phic regularity in his behavior-all these are abstractions of different kinds and all differ from the regularities of behavior in a group of persons which constitute culture. Indeed, the principal difficulty with this problem in the past seems to have come from the fact that culture was conceived of as the sum of the regular behavior of a number of individuals rather than as the regularity of their be- havior. It is easy enough to think of the behavior of an individual as influenc- ing, causing or forming part of a recurrent process with the behavior of one or more other individuals, but it is much more difficult to conceive of the behavior of a single individual as causing the regularity of the behavior of many others. Let us take a specific example, such as Darwin's publication of The Origin of Species, which was followed after some time by the acceptance of the doctrine of biological evolution by the majority of educated Westerners. If we examine the facts we see that each individual who read the book or heard about the doctrine reacted in an individual way. Huxley was tremendously enthusiastic and went about England lecturing on the subject; a number of bishops were firmly opposed and preached sermons against this new heresy, and so on. Each man's reaction was determined by his individual history, his character and the individual circumstances under which his opinions had been formed. But the regular aspects of their reaction was determined by the regular aspects of their histories, that is, by culture. We might consider an analogous problem in the physical sciences. A solu- tion of salt can be brought to a degree of saturation where almost anything-a slight tremor, a tiny change of temperature-will be followed by precipitation. If we try however to go on and imagine a degree of saturation such that the addition of a single molecule of salt will cause precipitation, we find that we have to define the precise position of each ion in the solution before we can ob- tain a picture of the situation which might conceivably be repeated. In other words, we find that we are still dealing with individuals. It is far more satisfac- tory to define saturation in a rough and general way, and to say that the satura- tion itself in combination with other gross aspects of the phenomena causes the precipitation. If we disregard the movement of individual molecules we have some hope of obtaining a formula which will describe the recurrent aspects of the process. Saturation, of course, is thought of to some extent as being the sum of the behavior of a large number of molecules; but if we take.concepts such as heat and pressure, which are thought of as regularities in the movement of large numbers of molecules, we cannot even conceive of the movement of a single molecule as affecting them at all. The behavior of a single individual then is simply incommensurate with</page><page sequence="15">BAGBY] CULTURE AND THE CAUSES OF CULTURE 549 the regularities we call culture. Sometimes in reading the writings of the more inveterate hero-worshipping historians, one gets the impression that they believe that some men-statesmen, artists or thinkers-have a special quality called greatness which somehow makes them larger than life and equivalent in weight and importance to the whole mass of their fellow-men. You are given the impression that the great mass of mankind intuitively recognizes the greatness of a great man and therefore his opinions are adopted, his works admired or his commands obeyed without any consideration of what the specific character of those opinions, works, commands may happen to be. It is as if most people believed in evolution simply because they knew that Darwin was a great man. But surely the greatness of a great man is nothing more than the fact that his opinions have been accepted or that his political leadership has been followed. It is true that such men also often have excep- tional gifts, but so also do many men who live and die in obscurity. The great- ness of great men is nothing inherent in their characters. We simply project upon our image of them the regularity of other men's favorable reaction to their deeds; their greatness is, in fact, culture. Since individual behavior and culture are incommensurate with each other, it follows that individual behavior cannot be part of a recurrent process in- volving culture; it cannot cause culture. But the reverse is also true; culture cannot cause individual behavior. We often speak as if it does, but if we exam- ine any particular case, we see that an individual's behavior must be related to his own past behavior or the behavior of other individuals; children learn from their parents, their teachers and their fellows, not from the society as a whole. This fact has sometimes been expressed by saying that "culture is mediated to the individual through other individuals," but even this is a loose manner of speaking in which we call individual behavior which is regular by the same name as its regularity. Of course, sometimes individuals come to conclusions about the culture of the society in which they live, and act on it. We can hear the New England spinster saying: "People don't do that sort of thing here." But even here culture can only be said to be a cause in the same way that the principles of geometry are the cause of the behavior of the sur- veyor. It is rather the concept in each case which is the cause, a concept formed by observing individual behavior. There are certain situations in which the actions of a single individual are regularly followed by the uniform or regular behavior of a large number of other individuals. Caesar orders "all the world to be taxed," for instance, or a colonel orders his regiment off the field. But these situations are closely defined cul- turally, and the individual ruler or commander is fully aware of the cultural definition of his role. The regularity of the reaction of subordinates is there- fore fully determined by other cultural regularities, their training or education in the roles which they are expected to play. Here again it is culture that</page><page sequence="16">550 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [55, 1953 determines culture; if Caesar were to order his subjects, or the colonel his troops, to stand on their heads, nothing but confusion would follow. It is not inconceivable that all items of culture might eventually be ex- plained in terms of hereditary regularities-human nature and race-in inter- action with differing environments. Cultural anthropology would then, in a sense, be reducible to psychology. But not, it should be noted, to individual psychology, only to those branches of psychology (general or racial) which deal with regularities in the behavior of large numbers of human beings. Whether such a reduction will actually be successful remains to be seen; certainly so far reductionism has been no more than partly successful in any of the other sciences. There seems, in fact, to be an inevitable tendency, when we are dealing with specific cases, for us to seek to explain items of culture in terms of other commensurate regularities and items of individual behavior in terms of other individual behavior. Bidney, for instance, who is one of the strongest sup- porters of the view that "culture is caused by individuals," nevertheless seeks to explain the specific case of "cultural crises" entirely in terms of culture or other commensurate regularities (1946). "Change," he says, "whether of so- ciety, culture or environment, may induce cultural crisis, and cultural crises may in turn stimulate invention or acculturation." It is curious to note that, although invention is usually brought forward as one of the primary instances of the individual's contribution to culture, Bidney himself treats invention as a cultural phenomenon explicable in terms of other cultural phenomena and thus gives the whole show away. A little further down the page, Bidney attempts to reintroduce the notion of free-will in a passage which deserves to be quoted in full: "If on the other hand, one adheres to the humanistic view submitted here, that man, under God, controls his own cultural destiny and is free to choose and realize the ends he would achieve, then he can be certain that much thought and effort will be expended by all who share this view towards the improvement of our human condition. It is precisely because of our belief that man can and ought to decide for himself the form of his future cultural de- velopment, that we can predict within limits, and with some measure of cer- tainty, the course of events in the near future." (1946: 541) This is an exceptionally splendid example of a nonsequitur. For if men really are free to choose their ends, there is no particular reason why they should choose the improvement of the condition of mankind any more than any other end. What Bidney is in fact doing is to stress the importance of certain moral standards as an element in our cultural tradition, and to point out that this fact may be used as a basis for partial predigtion. And his whole argument is conducted in terms of culture and human nature, as is evidenced most clearly by his use of the generic term "man."</page><page sequence="17">BAGBY] CULTURE AND THE CAUSES OF CULTURE 551 Coulborn too (1952: 115), in his argument on behalf of the individual, surreptitiously, or perhaps rather, unconsciously reintroduces the notion of broader regularities commensurate with culture. "If it had been Wallace and not Darwin," he argues, whose formulation of the doctrine of evolution won general acceptance, "there would have been a small difference, but, if for a series of, say, a dozen Darwins, there had been a dozen Wallaces, or even for a good part of the dozen there had been Wallaces instead of Darwins, then at any point far along in the development of the culture pattern the difference reached could have been great, and in all probability, would have been great." He concludes then that "this reasoning may be extended into a presentation of culture as an endless regression of contributions by human beings back- wards in saecula saeculorum." Now we know as a matter of fact that Wallace's theories were presented to the public earlier than Darwin's. If Darwin's theories were more successful in winning general approval, it seems likely that it was because they fitted in better with the general pattern of beliefs and prejudices current in Western society at that time. The difference between Wallace and Darwin then is not irrelevant. But let us accept the possibility that there might have been a dozen Wallaces rather than a dozen Darwins. In all probability then-Coul- born remarks in a footnote that he uses "probability" in the statistical sense-- the Wallaces would have differed from the Darwins not in any consistent way, but at random, and these random differences would cancel one another out so that the total effect would be nil. But if the Wallaces differed from the Darwins in some consistent way, then this difference would itself be a regularity com- mensurate with culture-it would fall under the general headings of culture or race or human nature-and we would no longer be talking in terms of indi- vidual contributions. Thus, however we may argue, in whatever direction we may turn, we always find ourselves back explaining culture in terms of regu- larities commensurate with it. We seem here, indeed, to be confronted with something like a necessity of thought. There is no need for us to deny the existence of free-will. That men make choices, that they sometimes discover novel means of expression, novel solutions to long-standing problems seems to be an immediate datum of experience, and free-will, in this sense, undeniably exists. But no one doubts that men's choices are always partly determined by the unalterable circumstances with which they are confronted and by their own predispositions towards particular ends. The scientific student of man-the anthropologist, the sociologist or the psychologist-seeks to discover precisely how far they are determined. As a scientist, he must deal with the order, the regularities in his chosen field, and the irregularities, the novelty or originality of certain human actions, must always escape his net. While it is desirable for the scientist as a matter of practice to assume that</page><page sequence="18">552 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [55, 1953 any particular phenomenon under investigation is fully determined in order that no feature of order should escape him, it is no longer possible to main- tain the general proposition that all phenomena are fully determined. For this would mean, if we translate it into our new terms, that the universe is complete- ly regular, and the mathematical logicians in their recent investigations have clearly shown that such a proposition is meaningless. Any system of order, existent or imaginary, must have some arbitrary elements in it, if only in its premises. A completely orderly universe is inconceivable; it could not exist. We may of course maintain, as some theologians have done, that the phenome- nal universe is fully determined by God, that the Diety is the first and uni- versal cause. But in so doing we simply refer the arbitrary or disorderly as- pects of the universe back to God. It is for this reason that the problem of evil admits of no logical solution, but only a mystical one. The universe then cannot be fully determined or completely regular; the champions of free-will need never fear that the scientist will win a final victory. On the other hand, the converse is also true. A completely disorderly universe or realm of experience is equally inconceivable; as the logicians have shown, even chaos must have some structure. The scientist may therefore be sure that there is some order, that there are some regularities to be discovered in any field he may choose to investigate. As we have seen in the case of Bidney, free-will is often conceived of not as being really free, as an element of disorder or novelty, but rather as a sort of assurance of the primacy and efficacy of certain moral standards. Coulborn too, seems to regret the diminished importance assigned by Kroeber to the individual chiefly because of the salutary influence which reading about the lives of great men has on the young. The point of view of the moralist is cer- tainly a valid and necessary one for the conduct of private life, even though it is a different point of view from that of the scientist. And no moralist would deny that there are limitations on the power of the individual to make his moral standards prevail; he would insist rather that we must go on striving whatever the difficulties. The scientist, on the other hand, must inevitably treat moral standards as simply another aspect of culture, to be explained just as any other aspect is explained. Nor need Coulborn fear that his students will cease to be inspired by the example of great men. After all, it is no little thing for a man to have been the first to see the necessary solution to a grave political problem, or for another to be the most skilled in giving aesthetic ex- pression to certain cultural or universal human tendencies. Such men are justly acclaimed, and will continue to be honored through the ages. Let us now summarize our argument. We have seen that the cultural anthropologist, if he is to be a scientist, must define culture as some sort of regularity, and we have chosen to define culture as regularities of behavior (excluding those which are clearly hereditary) among the members of a single</page><page sequence="19">BAGBY] CULTURE AND THE CAUSES OF CULTURE 553 society. We have replaced the naive or common-sense notion of causality by the scientific notion of regular recurrent process and we have substituted, for the old rule that the cause must be adequate to the effect, a new rule that recurrent processes must be composed of commensurate abstractions or phe- nomena. We have then deduced that culture must be explained by culture itself or by other commensurate regularities: bodily structure, human nature, race (including both physiological and psychological features) and environ- ment. We have shown that individual actions cannot be considered as causing culture, and that even the advocates of this position tacitly reintroduce the notion of culture or some regularities commensurate with it. And finally, we have pointed out that nothing in this argument need undermine the belief in free-will or the adherence of the moralist to his moral standards. Very similar views to those we have put forward have been expressed, explicitly or implicitly, in the past by other writers: Steward (1949: 1-7), Herskovits (1948: 608-621), and Kroeber (1917, 1944). If their views have not won general acceptance, it is perhaps because they have not made sufficiently clear how their arguments are derived from commonly accepted doctrines in epistemology and the philosophy of science. It is to be hoped that in so doing, at the present time, we have been able to make a genuine contribution to the clarification of the problem. In the last half century American anthropologists have tended, under the influence of Boas to limit themselves to the descriptive and classificatory sides of anthropology and to neglect what is surely one of the most important, perhaps the most important problem confronting the student of man: the elucidation of the flux of history. No doubt this self-limitation was justified by the scantiness of our knowledge at the beginning of the century, but the vast accumulation of data, anthropological, archeological and historical, in recent decades seems to justify a new attack on the dark fortress of our ig- norance. Toynbee and Kroeber have reawakened our hopes, and if, as Spengler maintained, historical change can only be understood as cultural change, it may be that it is the anthropologists who possess the conceptual weapons and the training necessary for a victorious assault. The preceding discussion is only a modest attempt to clean and sharpen some of these weapons before the attack begins. AMERICAN ACADEMY ROME, ITALY BIBLIOGRAPHY ALLPORT, G.
