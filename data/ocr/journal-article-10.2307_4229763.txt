Fort Worth: Amon Carter Museum, 1996. 8o pages, paper $24.95. Many years ago when I first discovered the painter Yasuo Kuniyoshi, I was sur- prised and intrigued to learn that an artist of Japanese descent had been working productively, and had been critically recognized, in New York in the early 1920S. Having seen a few of Kuniyoshi's paintings in museums in New York, Newark, and Honolulu, I had grown to appreciate his skill as a painter. Yet much about him remained a mystery, as he is rarely or only briefly mentioned in art-history books. Was he American born? If not, how did he come to be a part of the thriving art world of New York in the 192os? What were his influences, and how did his art compare to that of the other artists around him? Jane Myers and Tom Wolf shed light on these and other questions in The Shores of a Dream, a book produced in conjunction with the 1996 exhibition of the same name. Organized by the Amon Carter Museum in Fort Worth, Texas, the exhibition was a small but thoughtful selection of oil paintings and ink drawings done between 1921 and 1925. The paintings, executed in earthy tones of brown, red, and green, have a naive charm and sly wit and combine images from dreams and childhood memories or scenes with people from the Maine sea coast where Kuniyoshi painted during the summers. The ink-brush and pen drawings are exquisite renderings of similar subjects, as well as fruits and vegetation. Both the paintings and drawings in the exhibition are presented here in twenty full-color and thirteen black-and-white reproductions. Many other works, by both Kuni- yoshi and his contemporaries, are also reproduced in The Shores of a Dream. Yasuo Kuniyoshi was a highly esteemed American painter in the 1930S and 1940s, before the advent of abstract expressionism. He is probably best known for the work done during this later period: portraits of pensive women, idiosyncratic still lifes, and melancholic landscapes. The Shores of a Dream brings to our atten- tion what Wolf calls the "brilliant period of his first artistic maturity, the early 1920S." Wolf, a professor of art history at Bard College and the leading American Reviews 191</page><page sequence="2">Kuniyoshi scholar, presents these early years of Kuniyoshi's art with great thor- oughness, skillfully intertwining narrative descriptions of the artist's life with dis- cussions of his art-making. Myers, chief curator at the Amon Carter Museum, fol- lows with an informed essay about Kuniyoshi's accomplished drawings of the same period. The Shores of a Dream tells us that Kuniyoshi "envisioned America as the answer to his youthful dreams." Having encountered Westerners as a child in his home town by the Japan Sea, he had an early desire to travel to foreign lands. When he turned seventeen, he immigrated to America by himself to fulfill this desire and to escape harsh economic conditions in Japan. First settling in Los Angeles, he was encouraged by a high-school teacher to pursue art, which he did while supporting himself with manual labor and field work. In 1g9o he traveled to New York to con- tinue his art training and "was exposed to the heady dynamic world of American art at the moment it encountered European modernism." In 1916-after much lonely wandering, working at menial jobs, and trying out a number of art schools- he decided to study at the progressive Art Students League. The League provided the rich educational and social environment that Kuniyoshi sorely needed. The friends he made there-including his first wife, Katherine Schmidt-were to remain close for the rest of his life. His instructor at the League was Kenneth Hayes Miller, a highly respected teacher who, Katherine recalls, opened Kuniyoshi's "heart and eyes to the physical nature and sensuous beauty of the art of painting." Wolf details this formative period in New York, when Kuniyoshi interacted with artists, teachers, and patrons and attempted to assimilate Western art, mod- ernism, and the myriad of innovative ideas circulating at the time. Kuniyoshi's involvement with Penguin-a loose organization of progressive artists that held art exhibitions, drawing sessions, and boisterous costume parties-allowed him to get to know some of the most exciting artists working in New York. During that time, Kuniyoshi also met Hamilton Easter Field, a wealthy patron of the arts and a critic and collector. Wolf discusses Field at length because he had an impact on a number of artists, including Kuniyoshi. Field was impressed with Kuniyoshi's originality and became a sort of patron, providing Kuniyoshi and his wife with a place in his Brooklyn Heights building and at his summer art colony in Maine. Field, who embraced modernism and had a deep appreciation of Japanese art and American folk art, would, as Wolf explains, "play a significant role in the formation of Kuniyoshi's aesthetic." Field, says Wolf, both "actively encouraged Kuniyoshi to retain aspects of his Japanese artistic heritage" and stressed the importance of orig- inality and finding one's own voice. Kuniyoshi fulfilled all these expectations: as Field wrote about the artist's first one-man show, "He has expressed the ideals of modern Japan and of modern America as he has read them fused together in his own heart." By contrast, Field criticized Japanese artists in New York who worked strictly in a Western manner and did not achieve this kind of synthesis. In 1920 Kuniyoshi began showing his work at the progressive Daniel Gallery, and he had annual one-man shows there from 1922 to 1925. This is the period of Kuniyoshi's first mature work, and Wolf is most informative when discussing these pieces in terms of the sources of Kuniyoshi's inspiration and the ways in which the artist differed from his contemporaries. 192 Manoa . Land beneath the Wind</page><page sequence="3">Kuniyoshi's unique style evolved from three disparate sources: European mod- ernism, American folk art, and Japanese art. Perhaps the most cogent analysis that Wolf offers is how Japanese art and Kuniyoshi's cultural heritage inflected his work. However, these threads of Asian sensibility are not immediately apparent, for Kuniyoshi's art appears very Western. As Wolf says, "Finding a better defini- tion of this quality is a key issue in evaluating Kuniyoshi's work and his place in art history." Wolf compares the unusually low horizon in some of Kuniyoshi's work to the low angle typical in a Japanese print. He also explains that though some of the subjects in Kuniyoshi's drawings were possibly derived from Japanese prints, Kuniyoshi's approach was very Western and modern. Here, Wolf compares a nineteenth-century Japanese print of an octopus, a fish, and stylized waves with Kuniyoshi's ink drawing of an octopus menacing a fish with a cloud of black ink: Yasuo represents the octopus' ink by simply spreading ink on the middle of the page, creating a sophisticated pun on the literal nature of the medium and its depictive function. This type of artistic self-consciousness is quite alien to the Japanese tradition but is an essential part of modernism. To many critics of that time, some of Kuniyoshi's subjects seemed odd, humor- ous, or mysterious. For instance, cows often populated his paintings and draw- ings. When asked about this, Kuniyoshi would reply that he was born in the year of the cow (actually, the ox). Wolf writes that "cows were rare in Japan and fasci- natingly strange to the young immigrant painter." And, unlike his fellow artists at the art colony in Maine who painted typical landscapes and figures, Kuniyoshi painted fishermen, fish, sea creatures, frogs, and insects. Wolf attributes this to the artist's boyhood familiarity with these subjects in his home town and notes that sea creatures often appear in traditional Japanese art. The artist also depicted chil- dren in "unusual and psychologically loaded" paintings, such as Boy Stealing Fruit, Boy Frightened by Snake, and The Einstein Child. These portrayals, at once naive and mature, reflect Kuniyoshi's fascination with children during that time- a fascination that, Wolf says, "suggests that he had some sort of identification with them." What is apparent is that Kuniyoshi was continually able to fuse many influences and personal perceptions and thereby produce surprisingly distinctive works of art. Jane Myers, in her essay on Kuniyoshi's ink drawings of 1921 tO 1925, reveals to us the exceptional quality of these drawings and the importance of the drawing medium for the artist. During this period, Kuniyoshi created over sixty highly finished exhibition drawings using a distinctive pen, brush, and ink style. Floating scenes of human figures, animals, and plant forms and sensuous still lifes of fruit and other botanical objects-rendered in lush blacks with occasional hints of color-display his technical mastery, refined aesthetics, and creativity. Kuniyoshi was perhaps unique among his contemporaries in regarding his pen-and-ink drawings to be complete, individual statements. He said of drawing that it "is an independent creation, an intimate expression.... It requires infinitely more knowledge to produce a drawing, which in itself speaks as eloquently as a painting, without relying on color." Reviews 193</page><page sequence="4">Myers observes that the Japanese attributes of Kuniyoshi's work were espe- cially evident in his ink drawings: "The ink medium provided the means to com- bine personal subject with his 'exotic' heritage." Kuniyoshi's simplicity of form, highly controlled brush strokes, and tonal gradations invoke traditional Japanese ink drawings, but, Myers notes, the way Kuniyoshi applied ink was distinctly his own. His surfaces were richly textured, employing scraping and blotting for effect, and he included much detail. Yet the attraction of these drawings goes beyond their surface effects. Myers explains that though Kuniyoshi's art was more conser- vative than that of the best-known avant-garde artists, his drawings "revealed both the artist's personality and his understanding of his subject's inner essence." This quality, she says, "was intrinsic to modernism as it evolved in America." Kuniyoshi's drawings of this period conclude with sensually rendered fruits and vegetation. In these drawings he adds delicate color washes to highlight cer- tain features. The fruits are imbued with a subtle sexuality and anthropomorphic quality, as Myers notes: Dish with Banana ... depicts a piece of deteriorating fruit lying slack in a footed dish. The artist accentuates the encroaching rot through the heavy use of black in the fruit itself, which is lightly accentuated in yellow and capped by a dash of orange at its tip. He further emphasizes the sexual connotations of the banana's form by cradling it in the vase where, devoid of shading to fix its placement in space, it appears suspended. In contrast to the banana, the dish is pristine and cool, its bisque-like surface created by the paper itself. The Shores of a Dream gives us an opportunity to examine Yasuo Kuniyoshi's early paintings and drawings and to appreciate them in the context of the artistic milieu in which they were made. We see that out of his bicultural roots and the rich creative environment of New York, Kuniyoshi developed a unique personal vision. This vision would continue to evolve during a new phase in his career: when he left for Paris in 1925. Myers and Wolf guide us through the artist's early years, enriching our understanding of, and encouraging our admiration for, Kuni- yoshi's art. MASAYO SUZUKI 194 Manoa .
