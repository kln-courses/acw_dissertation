<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ethnie Identity, Cultural Variation, and Processes of Change Rethinking the Insights of Standardization and Orthopraxy Melissa J. Brown Stanford University Watson's view that culture held late imperial China together appears to be problematic with regard to standardization and insightful with regard to social theory. Ethnographic evidence about the assimilation of non-Han minority peoples to Han identity shows that orthopraxy led to many nonstandard cul tural practices and beliefs. Theoretical implications include reassessment of the canonical interpretive assumption that cultural ideas are the primary motivations for human actions. Additionally, the concept of a culturally uni fied China appears to be an ideology that benefits the Chinese state. Keywords: interpretive theory; Confucianism; Taiwan Aborigines; Chinese minorities; assimilation What held late imperial China together? The work of James L. Watson and others viewed late imperial Han culture as relatively uniform due to successive state regimes and local elites emphasizing standardization of practices (orthopraxy) rather than beliefs or ideas (J. Watson, 1985, 1988, 1993; e.g., essays in Johnson, Nathan, and Rawski, 1985; Watson and Rawski, 1988). Watson's initial formulation (1985) focused narrowly on practices worshipping Tianhou. However, he prefaced his examination of cer emonial practices within funerals with the deliberately provocative position that proper performance of funerary rites "was of paramount importance in Author's Note: I thank Don Sutton for his extraordinary efforts to get this collection of essays into print.

Watson (and others) expanded the explanations of orthopraxy and standardization to support the concept of a unified "cultural China" (Tu, 1991). Although acknowledging that ortho praxy allowed for regional, and even ethnic, variation, Watson suggested that standardization of ritual practice led to "the creation of a unified cul tural system" and that this system was characterized by "a high level of uni formity of beliefs, attitudes, and conceptions" (Watson, 1988: 10-11), at least regarding the dead. Here, acceptance of the Confucian teaching that "correct ideas follow from proper behavior" (Watson, 1993: 99) yielded the assumption that orthopraxy led to a high degree of cultural integration across China. Watson himself took up the broader notion of cultural China, indicating orthopraxy across a spectrum of core cultural practices, when he proposed that cultural unity derived from standardization was a major ele ment of what held Chinese society together (Watson, 1993). How strong is the evidence that culture held late imperial China together? Building on Watson's work, I argue two points and then discuss their implica tions. First, in contrast to Watson, I offer ethnographic evidence about the assimilation of non-Han peoples to Han identity which suggests that there was less standardization?both of practices and of cultural ideas?than previously believed. Second, in agreement with Watson, I suggest that orthopraxy offers insights into the process of changing practices and ideas under conditions that frequently obtained during the cultural contact that occurred with Han politi cal expansion. The theoretical implications of these points are complex and require making a clear distinction between ideas and practices in the concept of culture. Most importantly, orthopraxy raises questions about the Weberian derived interpretive assumption that cultural ideas are the primary motivation for human actions. An understanding of these implications, however, suggests why there was so much cultural variation among the Han?in other words, why a diversity of practices and ideas could all be considered Han. It also offers an opportunity for further research on orthopraxy in China to inform the social sciences more broadly about what motivates individual actors to adopt specific practices in the absence of the cultural ideas associated with them. Culture In order to clarify the usage of various terms relating to culture, I begin by discussing the distinction between ideas and practices, the distinction</page><page sequence="3">Brown / Ethnic Identity, Cultural Variation 93 between ideas and beliefs, and the distinction between assimilation and acculturation. According to interpretive anthropological theory?most famously articulated by Clifford Geertz (1973; but see also, e.g., Geertz, 1957, 1983; Sahlins, 1976; Schneider, 1980, 1984)?culture is the most important element in understanding a society; moreover, culture consists not of practices, which are behavior, but of the ideas shared across the society, which motivate the practices. Culture is shared, abstract (i.e., ideational), meaning-laden, and public. The "interpretive" element comes in during field work and analysis, when the anthropologist must realize that because actions constitute a text interpreted by different actors, each in a context, the dif ferent reports of a single event are all "true." It is the anthropologist's job to discover the shared, abstract, meaningful, and public ideas in common across the various interpretations and thus to discover the cultural basis underlying events (cf. Sperber, 1996). This interpretive tradition has domi nated American anthropology for decades (Kuper, 1999) and, despite attacks in the 1990s (e.g., Dirks, Eley, and Ortner, 1994), still dominates American anthropological journals (and increasingly European ones) and, I would add, the discipline.1 Unlike an older notion (Tylor, 1871) still underlying some contemporary historians' view of culture (e.g., Huang, 2000), this interpretive concept does not include practices as culture. What makes behavior a practice, and what makes a practice cultural? A practice is any act performed with some regu larity; but to be cultural, it must be the result of cultural ideas. By Edward Tylor's definition, which includes behavior, practices would be defined as cultural when they are themselves shared and meaningful. However, by the interpretive definition, practices are the result of culture, or more precisely the result of the ideas that constitute culture. The fact that such different relationships exist between culture and practices renders the term "cultural practices" highly ambiguous. Unless I specify otherwise, I follow the inter pretive definition here. Having distinguished ideas and practices, we still need to distinguish ideas and beliefs. Individual humans, of course, have many ideas in our minds that can be construed as neither cultural idea (for example, an idea that one would like to eat lunch) nor personally held belief (for example, an idea of the American dream, discussed below). The qualities that make an idea cul tural also distinguish cultural ideas from individually held ideas and from individually held beliefs: being widely shared, meaning-laden, and public. Anthropologists have never specified what proportion of a population must share an idea for it to be cultural (Brown, 1997; 2004: 216), though Geertz's postmodern critics portray him as assuming that the answer is all members</page><page sequence="4">94 Modern China of a culture (Dirks, Eley, and Ortner, 1994: 3). If one thinks instead of a threshold model?when some percentage of the society shares an idea, people perceive that idea as being shared by most if not all of the society? then an interpretive notion of culture is possible without assuming absolute social homogeneity. (Mass media probably affect such perceptions, as perhaps could orthopraxy in public performances of ritual.) Some variety also enters the picture when one realizes that "sharing" entails different individuals holding ideas that resemble each other so closely that that they are (socially) accepted as versions of the same idea (Sperber, 1996: 82; Wittgenstein, 1953). The requirement that an idea be meaningful takes us into the realm of belief, but an idea can be culturally meaningful and not believed by every individual in the population (see, e.g., Harrell, 1977). Meaning requires a regular relationship, and cultural meaning requires a regular relationship that is publicly known (Sperber, 1996: 79; see also Strauss, 1992a; D'Andrade, 1995). For example, the idea of the American dream is that with sufficient hard work anyone in the United States can become economically success ful, a success usually symbolized by home ownership. The idea is cultural because, first, many Americans share some version of that idea (though the dream houses they envision may vary widely), and second, the phrase "American dream" or sometimes even a picture of a 1950s-style house with a yard and a white picket fence regularly conjures up the idea, for individ uals and across the American public. Nevertheless, individuals may know about the cultural idea of the American dream?that is, have it in their minds and recognize public references to it?without personally believing in it as really possible and thus without finding the idea motivational (Strauss, 1992b). In identifying cultural ideas, I consider evidence of whether ideas are shared, meaningful (in the cultural sense), and public, not whether spe cific individuals personally believe in them. Following similarly from an interpretive definition of culture, "cultural unity" refers to a coherent, integrated system of public meanings, shared by some significant proportion of the population. "Our [anthropological] dou ble task is to uncover the conceptual structures that inform our subjects' acts ... and to construct a system of analysis in whose terms what is generic to those structures . . . will stand out against other determinants of human behavior" (Geertz, 1973: 27). This emphasis on coherence has subjected the interpretive notion of culture to postmodern criticism (e.g., Dirks, Eley, and Ortner, 1994). The call to focus on power-related variation not only dis rupts the notion of a coherent, integrated culture but also sets the stage to question the interpretive primacy of cultural meaning as motivation, because</page><page sequence="5">Brown / Ethnic Identity, Cultural Variation 95 a Foucauldian perspective considers power-related motivations primary (so too does an older materialist perspective, though in a different manner). Both an interpretive definition of culture and the Confucian culturalist assumption that proper practices lead to correct ideas imply that a coherent, integrated system of meanings correlates to uniformity of practice. These different positions invert causation, however?interpretivism views mean ings as leading to practices, while culturalism views practices as leading to meanings. We can take discussion of cultural unity, then, to extend to the ideational level. It is also important to distinguish culture, as discussed above, from identity. Watson suggested that despite regional variation, standardization of ritual practice via orthodoxy was required for being considered Han.2 "Assimilation" then refers to acquisition of Han identity. Identity is not simply "decided," for example, by people themselves, government officials, or anthropolo gists. Rather, identity?for individuals as well as for groups?is socially negotiated, depending on a range of factors. I argue that social (including political and economic) factors are the most important to the acquiescence of family, neighbors, and government about identity and, thus, that identity is fundamentally about politics rather than culture, ancestry, or both (Brown, 2004). Consequently, governments can play a determinative role, if they are willing to put state resources into the effort; but even authoritarian govern ments have to operate in the context of?that is, negotiate?popular response. An examination of shifting identity makes it clear that assimilation does not require acquiring standard Han practices or cultural ideas, and therefore it is important to distinguish between the acquisition of identity (assimilation) and the acquisition of culture (acculturation). Standardization and the Disjuncture between Culture and Identity Keeping in mind these points about culture, we can turn to the question of how culturally unified late imperial China was. Confucian culturalism suggests there was a great deal of unity (Crossley, 1990; Watson, 1993; Ebrey, 1996). However, two problems that arise for this ideologically derived position are relevant: Han "regional" variation and fluidity in the border to Han identity (for discussion of further problems with culturalism, see Brown, 2004: 24, 29, 31).3 Regional diversity within the Han popula tion is as great as or greater than that between different nations of Europe.4 Moreover, such current variation may derive from historic fluidity of identity,</page><page sequence="6">96 Modern China specifically from the assimilation to Han identity by indigenous peoples who did not adopt Han culture in its entirety (see, e.g., Pulleyblank, 1983; Norman, [1986] 1989,1988b; A. Wolf, 1989; Brown, 2004). Watson acknowl edged a high degree of Han regional variation but argued that it fit within "an overarching structure of unity" (Watson, 1993: 89). In this important and subtle point, he suggested it was not the details but the structure of practices that were standardized. His use of the term "structure" seems to refer not to power but rather to organization. By suggesting that orthopraxy operated at the level of how practices were organized, and that this organi zation promoted unity, Watson implied an underlying coherent, integrated system of meanings to the organization?in short, an interpretive notion of culture, and specifically a Confucian system of meanings. Watson (1988, 1993) offered empirical evidence, identifying a sequence of nine particular acts as the elementary organization of Han funerary ritual and discussing how various regional Han practices follow this same meaningful pattern. As we will see, however, fluidity of identity can disrupt both the organization and the meanings behind it. An examination of two cases of assimilation of non-Han peoples to Han identity indicates that there may have been less cultural standardization among people considered Han, including local elites, than has previously been assumed. "Locals" (tujia) in eighteenth- through twentieth-century Hubei were apparently able to assimilate without adopting practices subject to orthopraxy or ideas considered major elements of standard Han culture (and thus part of the unity of cultural China). Not even the local elite adopted these elements. Plains Aborigines in seventeenth-century Taiwan assimi lated, apparently with even fewer Han customs in their repertoire. Moreover, despite adopting many Han cultural practices, a different group of Taiwan plains Aborigines could not acquire Han status through the beginning of the twentieth century (they acquired Han identity around 1930 for different rea sons). An analysis of this latter case of failure to assimilate calls into ques tion the importance of cultural practices to assimilation, thereby undercutting a major incentive for orthopraxy in frontier areas. Locals (Tujia) in Southwestern Hubei Although the Tujia have been officially recognized as a distinct, non Han minority group in China since 1957, they were considered the local Han (tujia) for many years before 1949?albeit a rather provincial or uncouth version of Han (Brown, 2002; 2004: 179-90).5 Not only did locals them selves, including the novelist Shen Congwen (e.g., 1982), view themselves</page><page sequence="7">Brown / Ethnic Identity, Cultural Variation 97 as Han (in distinct contrast to neighboring Miao peoples), but outsiders coming in also accepted them as Han, including personnel who were removed to Enshi along with the Hubei provincial government during the war with Japan. Many people I spoke with in Enshi recounted the shock of locals conscripted by the Nationalists and taken off to Taiwan in the 1940s when they returned in the late 1980s and discovered that the People's Republic of China had officially classified their relatives as a non-Han ethnic minority (Tujia).6 Despite this pre-1949 Han identity, however, some local customs departed significantly from standard Han practices. Most notably, given Watson's emphasis on the cultural unity of funerary rituals, locals in the Enshi did not prepare a soul tablet for every deceased person (Watson's ele mentary structural practice no. 5) and often did not expel the coffin from the community (elementary structural practice no. 9) (see Table 1 in Sutton's essay in this issue). The latter departure is more striking as it is clearly vis ible to a visitor from outside, because the graves were located within the community, often immediately adjacent to homes. Such siting was com monplace in many parts of the Enshi Tujia Miao Autonomous Prefecture in southwestern Hubei in 1996?both as a current practice and as a tradition. One man in a community well known for the beauty of its Qing-period tombstones (located within the village) told me, "The dead and the living should live together." In a village I call Wucun where I interviewed more extensively, I observed older graves within the community as well as a funeral in which the grave was near two occupied houses (only one of which belonged to relatives of the deceased). People whom I interviewed? including local7 farmers, scholars and ritual specialists, and one man whose family had been prominent landlords before 1949?all found nothing unusual in the location of these graves. In response to my surprise, people frequently explained that placing a grave near the home of descendants made its care easier. Further probing in interviews suggested that this strategy was one of several (including carving lists of descendants' names on tombstones) intended to cajole descendants into caring for graves. Although ancestral tablets existed in Enshi, their spotty distribution departs from the expectation of standard Han funerary structure that every person have a soul tablet.8 Many people I interviewed in Enshi reported that they had never had any ancestral tablets in their family; tablets, they said, were a way of remembering the dead for people with enough money to do so. (Tablets were expensive, as there was a local expectation that they would be provided periodic offerings of incense at least; some families also included spirit money, firecrackers, or kowtows.) Moreover, on interviewing</page><page sequence="8">98 Modern China more men from the pre-1949 local elite, I discovered that even wealthy families with many ancestral tablets did not provide tablets for all their patrilineal members. These families were guided in their actions not by cost but by principle. Tablets listed one wife for each husband, so men who had no wives or had more than one wife (through remarriage) could not have tablets. I link these funerary practices?unusual for people viewed as Han?to more fundamental departures in practices commonly considered part of a culturally unified Han core. The ubiquity of the concept of filiality (xiao) across linguistically distinct regions has led to a general scholarly assump tion that Han in late imperial China universally provided such material care for their living, elderly patrilineal relatives and such offerings for patrilin eal soul tablets as were within their financial means (Watson and Rawski, 1988; but see Ikels, 2004, for documentation of modern-era variation in actual practices related to filiality). Similarly, scholars generally assume that brothers in late imperial China inherited approximately equal shares of the family property?or if there were disparities, it was the eldest brother who inherited more, sometimes only if he had a living son at the time of property division (see, e.g., Hanley and Wolf, 1985; R. Watson, 1985: 106 7; A. Wolf, 1989; Gates, 1996: 91-95). However, in Wucun, though people said that brothers inherited equally as a general rule, reports of property inheritance in their own families indicated that for most families, most if not all of whatever property and ancestral tablets existed was given to the youngest surviving brother (lao yao).9 Many people explained that the youngest son received most or all of the property because he took care of his parents, feeding them in their old age and burying them, since he was usually still living with his parents when they needed such care while his older brothers had already left (fenjia). There are a number of related practices here that depart from standard expectations. Poor men often left their parents' homes as soon as they mar ried, if not before, and even wealthy men often stayed no later than the birth of their first child. One of several men who told me he received little or nothing upon leaving his parents' home to establish a new household with his wife initially explained that with seven brothers his family had no prop erty to divide (he was the sixth brother, and he received a wok as his patri mony). Further in the interview, however, he reported that his parents had a little bit of land (1-2 mu, which is less than 1/7.5 of a hectare or a third of an acre). When I asked who inherited it, he said that he received none because he did not want it (meiyao), he wanted his parents to have it; but he admitted that his younger brother had got all the land after his parents died.</page><page sequence="9">Brown / Ethnic Identity, Cultural Variation 99 Other men?including men from well-to-do homes?reported them selves or their brothers arranging their own marriages, often after having already left home (fenjia), and still other men reported disproportionate parental investment in the educations of younger sons over older sons. One man explained that he was taught carpentry while his younger brother had sufficient schooling to become a village-level official. Although people sometimes suggested that if family members got along the family might wait until all brothers married before establishing each in separate house holds, only one man I interviewed reported that his own family (with five brothers) had done so, and he explicitly said there was no property to divide. (They split up when a drought hit and there was not enough food in the household of more than thirty persons to go around.) Interviews suggest that in general practice, care for aging parents and their burial were pro vided by brothers remaining in the household at the time of need?usually the youngest brother, who had little if any support from older brothers who had left earlier. Thus, in establishing a separate household (fenjia) men divided property with their parents, not their brothers. Parents decided what property a man could take with him when he left home, keeping the rest to provide for those remaining in the household?themselves and any younger siblings. Parents held on to most (and sometimes all) of their property, giving rela tively little to older sons as they left, and younger sons, who were still at home when their parents died, wound up with the parental property by default. These practices and accompanying attitudes extended to the local elite as well. The Confucian-educated son of a major landholder explained: Once [a man's] first child is born he must quickly establish his own home (fenjia) [because] the responsibility of the senior generation ends [with the birth ofthat child]. Because sons split off at different times, parents must plan ahead and decide what to give whom. The youngest gets a little more than the oldest [because] he doesn't really split off. He's young, so that by the time he marries, his parents are not necessarily alive. Here we see that the separation of households applied both ways. Even the very wealthy did not provide for their patrilineal grandchildren or arrange marriages for all their sons, further departures from what are often assumed to be "core" Han practices. These practices?and other practices, such as those to encourage the tending of graves by descendants?suggest that filial obligation, in the</page><page sequence="10">100 Modern China sense of material care of living elderly parents as well as ritual care for the souls of the deceased, ended upon a man's marriage or, at the latest, the birth of his first child. Moreover, the ethnographic evidence gives no indi cation that the elite were in any way the promoters of standard Han prac tices of filial obligation. To the contrary, the elite apparently saw no conflict between this practice and their Confucian education. Because these locals were accepted as Han (before 1949), they demon strate greater regional variation than expected from the idea of a Han cul tural unity. This variation likely had to do with fluidity in Han identity, and specifically in the ability of locals in southwestern Hubei to take on a Han identity without recourse to their cultural practices. Han identity in this region, then, was fluid?the border to Han shifted around locals, despite significant differences in cultural practices (and ideas). Plains Aborigines in Southwestern Taiwan To show that southwestern Hubei was not unusual within the empire in accepting such departures among people considered Han, I turn to the example of Taiwan. Circumstantial evidence suggests that seventeenth century plains Aborigines acquired Han identity without practicing many standard Han practices, in a case parallel to that of locals in Hubei. Moreover, detailed ethnographic evidence shows that in the twentieth century, practic ing standard Han customs did not suffice to enable a different group of plains Aborigines to acquire Han identity. In the seventeenth-century case, we see greater regional variation than expected because of a fluid Han iden tity; in the twentieth-century case, we see cultural conformity (accultura tion) without assimilation (the acquisition of mainstream identity), though these residents of Taiwan did acquire Han identity later (around 1930, fol lowing the political intervention of the Japanese colonial government). Although the early case for disjuncture is not as strong as for locals in Hubei or plains Aborigines in twentieth-century Taiwan, it is nevertheless useful because of its relative independence from the other cases. The gov ernments in seventeenth-century Taiwan were Dutch (1624-61) and Zheng (1662-83), and the latter adopted much of the Dutch infrastructure. By con trast, the Hubei case was influenced by the Qing, Republican, and Communist governments, and the twentieth-century Taiwan case by the Qing (1683 1895 in Taiwan) and Japanese (1895-1945) governments. There is no over lap of governments between seventeenth-century Taiwan and Hubei, or between the two Taiwan cases, and only an overlap of the Qing government between twentieth-century Taiwan and Hubei. However, the Qing in Taiwan</page><page sequence="11">Brown / Ethnic Identity, Cultural Variation 101 adopted policies on taxation and land tenure from the Zheng regime before it that originated with the Dutch (see, e.g., Shepherd, 1993), so the two sets of governments in the Taiwan cases are more closely related than they might initially appear. For the same reason, however?the Qing's reliance on policies originating with the Dutch?the twentieth-century Taiwan and Hubei cases are more independent than they might initially appear. The dis tinctness of the various governments indicates a degree of independence between the process of identity change in Hubei, twentieth-century Taiwan, and seventeenth-century Taiwan that strengthens the support for the dis juncture of identity and culture provided by the similarity of results. For the seventeenth-century case, discrepancies between Dutch-period census records of 1650 and Zheng-period records circa 1680 suggest that in one area of the southwestern Taiwan plains, between 16,000 and 22,000 individuals?perhaps 40 to 50 percent of the total population in that area around 1650?changed identity from Aborigine to Han under Zheng rule (for more detailed discussion, see Brown, 2004: chap. 4).10 Households that changed identity were probably "mixed"?containing both Han and Aborigine members, or members of mixed Han-Aborigine ancestry, or both?because Dutch-, Zheng-, and Qing-period records suggest high intermarriage rates between Han immigrant men and Aborigine women. We can infer that the mixed population had adopted little of Han culture by examining practices of the Aborigine population in the Dutch period and analyzing the differ ential treatment of Han and Aborigines under Dutch rule. ' ' The mixed population may have been involved in commercial agricul ture. Throughout the Dutch period (1624-61) and well into the Qing period (1683-1895 in Taiwan), Aborigine villages did not, by and large, participate in the production of cash crops, despite government encouragement. The few Aborigine villages from which Dutch occasionally bought surplus grain and the eight villages that paid Zheng taxes in grain?and thus were producing a surplus, as required by commercial agriculture?may have had Han living there, perhaps as part of a mixed population. The mixed popu lation may have spoken Chinese. Aborigine communities each had an offi cial whose position is often referred to as "interpreter." However, because these interpreters also served as tax collectors, it is not clear how many Aborigines may have learned a Chinese language, and how fluently. A mixed population would have had the opportunity to be bilingual, and bilin gualism would have offered some economic opportunities, especially if most Aborigines were still not native speakers of Chinese. There are some Qing-period references to interpreters with a Han father and Aborigine mother. Nevertheless, Dutch missionaries' continued use of Austronesian</page><page sequence="12">102 Modern China languages to communicate with Aborigine communities suggests that regard less of whether Aborigines, or the mixed population, learned Chinese, vil lages labeled Aborigine maintained primary use of Austronesian languages. The mixed population could not have adopted many Han customs during the Dutch period even if they wanted to do so. For example, the Dutch required Han men who wished to marry Aborigine wives to convert to Christianity, so there would be no ancestral tablets in mixed homes. Moreover, Dutch missionaries lived in communities with the power to fine people of whose behavior they did not approve. Given that offenses included such minor acts as not wearing shoes on Sunday, and given the general Dutch suspicion of Han, it seems unlikely that the missionaries would have allowed many stan dard Han practices, such as the funerary practices described by Watson (1988, 1993). Other practices would simply have been impractical: foot binding, for example, was precluded by the need for women's labor in the fields and by the general absence in Taiwan of Han women who knew the binding process. Thus, at the beginning of the Zheng period when most people of mixed ancestry acquired Han identity, they probably had adopted few Han customs, beyond the use of commercial agriculture and some Chinese language. Here, the border to Han appears to have shifted around a mixed Aborigine-Han population without their having embraced many major aspects of standard Han culture. At the beginning of the twentieth century, villagers, neighboring Han, and historical records classified Toushe, Jibeishua, and Longtian in south western Taiwan as plains Aborigine villages despite many shared customs, some Han ancestry, and some shared cultural ideas (for a more detailed analysis, see Brown, 2004: chap. 3). People in these villages spoke Minnan? the Chinese dialect of their Han neighbors?as their native language and had done so for decades. Even around 1900, only the oldest villagers remembered a few words of their ancestors' Austronesian language. Villagers grew the same cash crops?rice and sugarcane?under the same rental terms as their Han neighbors. They dressed just as did neighboring Han of the same economic class. They used the same forms of marriage (though in different proportions than nearby Han, a difference recoverable from colo nial household registers but unlikely to be visible to their neighbors). Except for the Christian minority, villagers buried their dead in the same way, with a Taoist priest presiding, following the standard Han funeral structure described by Watson (1988, 1993). Families had ancestral tablets for all their dead and provided regular offerings. Graves were located outside the community.12 Children who survived to adulthood had parentally arranged marriages. Brothers shared more or less equally in property inheritance and</page><page sequence="13">Brown / Ethnic Identity, Cultural Variation 103 were all responsible for contributions to cover the care and burial of elderly parents. (Sons of uxorilocally married daughters usually inherited property and helped to care for their grandparents only if they took their maternal grandfather's surname.) Differences that existed in tending graves (such as the lack of tomb-sweeping customs) would likely have been overlooked, in part because of Han religious taboos regarding proximity to other people's dead. Absence of a Han-style temple would not have been remarkable for such poor communities, and worship of an Aborigine deity by most vil lagers and Christian worship by a minority appear to have gone largely unnoticed outside these villages. Han cultural practices diffused more widely in these villages than did Han ideas. Most Toushe, Jibeishua, and Longtian villagers linked surnames with property inheritance as Han elsewhere do, for example, but some vil lagers who espoused this idea expressed ambivalence about it, with a few even giving property to children who bore their uxorilocally married father's surname. Also, Han marriage forms did not always carry the same mean ings. Poor Han men, who would otherwise not get brides, married into these villages, at a rate of perhaps 10 percent of all local marriages in the early twentieth century (Brown, 2001b, 2004).13 While uxorilocally married men would have faced scorn in Han villages, they did not in Toushe, Jibeishua, and Longtian. The local ideational system of culture did change, moving toward a Han model, but ideas changed after practices were introduced, and some ideas spread more quickly than others. Here, then, is a case showing a high degree of standardization in prac tices and some standardization of cultural ideas. Some people in these com munities even had Han ancestry (a common way of claiming Han identity; Ebrey, 1996), so why were these villages still considered plains Aborigine? Absence of a single cultural practice flagged these communities as non Han: they did not bind women's feet. Again and again in interviews, people spoke of the importance of this marker in the most pejorative terms: "We savages didn't bind feet." That footbinding identified the accepted border to Han in this area is ironic in two ways. First, footbinding was far from uni versal among Han, so it cannot be considered part of the core of standard Han practices. It was not generally an ethnolinguistic marker (though its absence marked Hakka and non-Han peoples who were close to footbind ing areas; Yu, 2005); rather, regional variation in its frequency across eco nomic classes was linked to the availability of light labor for women (Gates, 2001, n.d.; Bossen, 2002). Second, the interview responses that invoked "we savages" show the degree to which local people were culturally Han, because they had internalized enough Han cultural ideas to believe that lack</page><page sequence="14">104 Modern China of footbinding proved them less than civilized, less than Han. Being cul turally Han (acculturated), however, was not sufficient to win them Han ethnic identity (assimilation). This twentieth-century Taiwan case also suggests that the disjuncture between Han identity and standard Han cultural practices seen among locals in Hubei is not an anomaly. If the Confucian culturalist claim of a link between standard practices and Han identity obtained, then the peoples of Toushe, Jibeishua, and Longtian would have had Han identity by 1900 (if not earlier) because they practiced major aspects of standard Han culture? funeral rites with soul tablets, language, agricultural practices, property inheritance, and so on. Moreover, the Confucian culturalist claim would lead us to expect that any single cultural practice whose absence could pre vent these communities from acquiring a Han identity would have to be one of the standard practices. Yet that expectation is not met, for the practice that most strongly marked the border to Han here was footbinding. These cases raise two issues for consideration. First, the degree of Han cultural standardization and unity previously extrapolated from orthopraxy seems overly optimistic, given the departure from standard Han cultural practices demonstrated by local Han in Hubei and probably shown by the seventeenth-century mixed Han-Aborigine population who acquired Han identity in the Zheng period. Therefore, we need to ask, how "standard" was "standard"? More specifically, how widely distributed in the popula tion were the practices and cultural ideas that were considered standard, both across regions and within regions? Second, that plains Aborigines who did practice standard Han customs at the beginning of the twentieth century were not able to acquire Han identity challenges the accuracy of Confucian culturalism in describing assimilation,14 as well as its assumed role in pro moting orthopraxy. If cultural practices did not confer Han identity, then how did people "become Chinese"? I argue that identity is based on social experience and thus is driven by political-economic factors like changes in regime (for detailed evidence, see Brown, 2004). Basically, people become Chinese when conditions in the political economy support their successful social negotiation of a Han identity. Standardization, then, does not appear to have been necessary for assimilation to Han identity. Orthopraxy as Process That less standardization occurred, and less was necessary for assimilation, than previously thought does not argue against the utility of considering</page><page sequence="15">Brown / Ethnic Identity, Cultural Variation 105 orthopraxy in relation to standardization. To the contrary, the analysis of this relationship yields some important theoretical insights about social change. The view that cultural standardization?a coherent, integrated sys tem of a core set of shared, meaningful ideas?occurred via promotion of orthopraxy implies that practices are more readily transmitted across a pop ulation than cultural ideas, and that ideas (and personal beliefs) will follow. In more closely examining aspects of the assimilation cases discussed above, we find that (a) there is a disjuncture between practices and cultural ideas, (b) practices can spread more easily across a population than can their associated cultural ideas, (c) the adoption of a practice is not neces sarily due to the associated cultural idea's being already held, and (d) the disjuncture between practices and ideas allows for change in the ideational content linked to specific practices, as well as changes in other related prac tices. The Hubei case shows that the disjuncture between practices and cul tural ideas (point a) occurs broadly across the population. The disjuncture is identifiable because the practice of maintaining ancestral tablets was linked to unexpected practices and cultural ideas (point d). However, we must turn to more specific examples?Puyuma ancestral tablets, the gender change in the Thai Tsoo spirit medium, and an unusual case of marriage (all from twentieth-century Taiwan)?to see more clearly the order of transfer (points b and c) and how they make change possible (point d). Ancestral Tablets As discussed above, some locals in Hubei provided ancestral tablets for some of their dead, but even the wealthy elite did not provide tablets for all deceased patrilineal family members. Moreover, locals did not personally believe in or have knowledge of cultural ideas commonly associated with ancestral tablets. Even locals whose families had ancestral tablets did not share the cultural idea (held by Han elsewhere) that they contained the souls of the dead. One elderly Wucun farmer whose family had had four genera tions of tablets (an extensive collection by local standards) before 1949 told me that an ancestral tablet is "only a written name" and scoffed at the notion of souls at all. Other farmers and craftspeople also told me that ancestral tablets contained no souls and were merely remembrances. These responses may seem more about belief than cultural ideas, until one realizes that even in 1996, many people seemed surprised by my question about whether ances tral tablets contained souls. One local scholar (who asked me where I had gotten such a strange idea) expressed the sentiment that if people in Taiwan think ancestral tablets contain souls, Taiwanese must be very different from</page><page sequence="16">106 Modern China Chinese. In this part of Hubei, no regular relationship between ancestral tablets and souls was recognized publicly, and no such idea was shared across the local population. Thus locals show a clear disjuncture between the practice of maintaining ancestral tablets and the associated cultural idea that tablets are needed as a repository for the soul of the deceased. Initially, I wondered whether the widespread absence of the idea that ancestral tablets contained souls derived from post-1949 campaigns against ancestor worship as feudal superstition. However, several factors led me to discount that explanation (though the absence may well have been rein forced by post-1949 campaigns). First, as discussed above, before 1949 even wealthy families with many ancestral tablets had not regularly pro vided them for all their patrilineal members?not the behavior one would expect if the idea that souls needed ancestral tablets as a repository were prevalent. Second, one man, who remembered the family's ancestral tablets? more than a thousand of them?being moved to his grandfather's house around 1938 (because the branch of the family that had previously kept them had become impoverished), reported that family members had carried the tablets themselves, without the help of ritual specialists who likely would have been hired if they had believed they were moving actual souls. Third, another man, who had saved his parents' tablet from destruction dur ing the Cultural Revolution, brought it out from its decades-long hiding place and handed it to me.15 It seems very unlikely that anyone who thought ancestral tablets even might contain souls would handle his parents' tablet outside a ritual context (except under dire circumstances, like saving it from a fire) or voluntarily hand it to a foreigner. Fourth, a well-educated member of the pre-1949 elite explained that ancestral tablets do not contain souls (guihun), because people hire ritual specialists in order to make souls leave: The Taoist priest or the wizard takes it [the soul, guihun] outside the home [in a rite known as "leading the way," kailu]', that is why people hire them in the first place. The purpose of a funeral is for the Taoist priest to persuade the soul to leave (hao zou). Taoists priests are polite (shuo hao). If they cannot get the soul to leave, then a wizard is brought in who is fierce and gets rid of it once and for all.16 No one else offered any explanation for the lack of souls in ancestral tablets, but everyone I interviewed in Wucun, as well as some people in other parts of Enshi, mentioned kailu as the basic rite that must be per formed in every funeral. Finally, to ascertain whether the absence of the idea of the souls' presence was confined to the laity, I interviewed several</page><page sequence="17">Brown / Ethnic Identity, Cultural Variation 107 men who had been ritual specialists before 1949, including one Taoist priest. All agreed that ancestral tablets did not house the souls of the dead. The Taoist priest assured me that neither Buddhism or Taoism places the spirit in the tablet. Two wizards and the Taoist priest confidently told me that people without tablets, and even without descendants, did not become hungry ghosts. This evidence persuaded me that the cultural idea that ancestral tablets contained souls really was absent, even before 1949. In its place, I found some nonstandard ritual practices and cultural ideas. For example, residents of this area less often produced and purchased the material items required for offerings (e.g., incense, spirit money, food), and less frequently organized extended families to make offerings (e.g., on death anniversaries), than did those in areas with standard practices. Moreover, one wizard and the Taoist priest (interviewed together) concurred that while burning incense and other offerings showed filiality (xiao), or proper respect, it did not provide material care for the ancestors.17 The filiality that these practices entailed was a distant kind of respect; it did not require material care. Such an idea runs counter to assumed standard Han culture (see Gates, 1996: 91; but cf. Ikels, 2004). Both the absence of the cultural idea expected to be associated with ancestral tablets and the departure from related stan dard Han practices are particularly remarkable because the practices and ideas involved are all viewed as core Confucian aspects of "standard" Han culture. That ancestral tablets were present among locals in Hubei unaccom panied by the idea that such tablets contain souls also suggests that the practice may have begun, spread, and persisted independently of the idea. However, this case requires us to infer a past process of orthopraxy from more recent distributions of practices and ideas. We might plausibly sur mise that such a process could work via the ethnic intermarriage between a Han man and an indigenous woman, as children were persuaded to make an ancestral tablet for their deceased father out of respect for his wishes (e.g., Brown, 2004: 158), but such a scenario remains purely speculative. While it is unlikely that we will uncover the actual process by which ancestral tablets were adopted by locals in Hubei or plains Aborigines in Taiwan, ethnographic evidence does exist of ancestral tablets being taken up more recently by a different indigenous group in Taiwan. Suenari Michio (1994) discusses the adoption of Han-style ancestor tablets in one Puyuma mountain Aborigine community in southeastern Taiwan that already had an indigenous form of ancestor worship. Han men began marrying uxorilocally?the standard Puyuma form of marriage?into this community in the Qing period.</page><page sequence="18">108 Modern China Although the descendants of these original [Han] Chinese peddlers have been culturally absorbed into Puyuma society, they still maintain a "memory" of their Chinese ancestor and his origin. Descendants who claim this link with a Chinese ancestor often establish a Chinese style ancestor tablet, assuming their Chinese ancestors would be happier to be commemorated in the Chinese way. It is to be noted that this act does not involve boasting of Chinese descent. (Suenari, 1994: 206) However, most ancestral tablets in the community were not introduced until after World War II, when Japanese colonial dictates, Christian prose lytization, and a huge influx of Han migrants had already wrought other changes on Puyuma society. Suenari's research suggests that although ances tor worship and adoption of tablets resulted from the inculcation of in marrying Han fathers, practices relating to the tablets were modified to agree more closely with preexisting Puyuma customs and cultural ideas. (Modified customs include daughters' often taking custodial responsibility for the tablets.) Thus, indigenous cultural ideas were not sufficient to pre vent Han-style practices from being introduced but they held sway in deter mining the meanings attributed to the new practices, at least through Suenari's field season in 1983. Here, then, we see that individuals' adoption of a practice (Han-style ancestral tablets) does not require that they already hold the associated cul tural idea that such tablets are a repository for the deceased's soul. Nor appar ently does the standard idea necessarily follow from the practice, contrary to the Confucian culturalist assumption that proper practices, such as making ancestral tablets, will lead to the corresponding Confucian cultural idea. In the Puyuma case, it is clear that the practice of maintaining Han-style ances tral tablets spread more readily than the associated cultural idea.18 However, because the Puyuma already maintained an indigenous form of ancestor wor ship, perhaps it was both easier for the practice of Han-style ancestral tablets to have spread to them, since it complemented their existing practices, and harder for Han cultural ideas to have spread, since there were competing ideas in place about the treatment of ancestors and the disposition of their souls. Thus, I turn now to a case in which a Han-style practice spread in a community despite the prevalence of a contradictory cultural idea. A Spirit Medium's Gender and Influence on Ritual Practices The next example of the disjuncture between practices and cultural ideas shows not only that a practice can be adopted without the associated</page><page sequence="19">Brown / Ethnic Identity, Cultural Variation 109 cultural idea?in fact, it can occur in the presence of an opposing cultural idea?but also that practices spread more readily than cultural ideas. It is also a case in which the subsequent influence of the disjuncture resulted in standardization of ritual practices. In early-twentieth-century Taiwan, it was obvious, even to a casual observer, that religious practices dedicated to Thai Tsoo, an Aborigine deity in Toushe village, were different from Han religious practices (see also Brown, 2003, 2004). In contrast to the deities of Han folk religion (cf. A. Wolf, 1974; Jordan, 1985; Weiler, 1987), Thai Tsoo was represented by vases or pots with plants in them instead of by anthropomorphic images. Temples were walled only on three sides as opposed to four. Temples were located outside village living areas instead of being within the community. Altars were low to or on the floor, not elevated. Pig skulls decorated the temple. Daily offerings were betel nut chaws and rice wine (mijiu), not incense and food. Annual festivals included special songs?originally in Austronesian, taught syllable by syllable in the twentieth century since vil lagers had become native speakers of Minnan Chinese?and a dance per formed by villagers. Like Han annual festivals, however, these festivals did include entire pigs as offerings. At that time, according to interview reports, people believed the deity's spirit medium should be a woman. All but one of the changes that occurred in Thai Tsoo worship in Toushe over the twentieth century were toward a Han cultural model. The role of Thai Tsoo spirit medium transferred permanently to men, first at the temple (Minnan: kong-kai) near the main settlement and later at the temple farther up in the foothills that was near one of the satellite settlements. The deity may have even been called Alik Bu by the women spirit mediums, indicating a possible change in the deity's name as well.19 The first transfer occurred so early in the twentieth century that I was not able to reconstruct how it happened from my interviews in the 1990s. The second transfer? which, on the basis of interview reports, I date to the 1930s?links the change in the gender of the person holding the role of spirit medium to a change in marriage patterns taking place at the time. (Uxorilocal marriages were becoming rare, as virilocal marriage became predominant.) Men who acquired the role subsequently changed religious practices, thereby increas ing conformity with standard Han ritual practices (described below). At the same time, the number of women villagers conducting a nonstandard ritual practice for Thai Tsoo (spraying rice wine over the betel offerings) report edly fell, as did the number of women chewing betel. A woman whom I will call Tan A-lien (a pseudonym, as are all the names in this paragraph) was the last female spirit medium at the satellite temple.</page><page sequence="20">110 Modern China When Tan's efforts to find a woman to take over the role after her failed, she trained her son instead. Tan had a woman who acted as her assistant. That assistant's daughter-in-law, Lim Mui-mue, told me that she herself instructed villagers in the songs for the annual festival. Tan had taught her the songs but not how to perform the important kaixiang (opening power) rite that had been a source of friction between Tan and the second male spirit medium at the main temple, Lo Kim-hok. In fact, one villager who discussed this history with me was of the opinion that the divorce between Tan's daughter and Lo's son was related to disputes between Tan and Lo on religious matters. Specifically, Tan refused to teach Lo the kaixiang ritual in its entirety. When Lim volunteered that people thought that the Thai Tsoo spirit medium should be a woman, I asked why Tan had taught her son the kai xiang rite and not her daughter. Lim said that it was because Tan's daughter had married out virilocally and Tan's daughter-in-law (who married in virilocally) could not learn it. When I interviewed Tan's daughter-in-law, she told me that she had wanted to learn the rite but Tan A-lien would not teach her. Given this report, I believe Lim Mui-mue meant not that Tan's daughter-in-law was intellectually incapable of learning it but that she ought not to learn it, because of her status as a virilocally married woman. Tan sought to teach Lim Mui-mue the kaixiang rite, but Lim refused. When I asked Lim to explain her refusal, she said that she was not married at the time and did not know where she would marry; she did not think mar rying uxorilocally was a possibility. I asked Lim why she did not reconsider after she married virilocally within Toushe. Lim said she did not want to go out frequently for healing rites, another major part of the spirit medium's duties, because she had small children. (Tan, by contrast, had become spirit medium when she was in her 40s and her children were old enough to be left unsupervised.) Thus, Lim linked virilocal marriages?which began increasing dramati cally around 1930?both to Tan's inability to pass the role of Thai Tsoo spirit medium on to her daughter and to Lim's own rejection of the role. At the time it was taken on by a man, Toushe people reportedly still did not think that the Aborigine deity's spirit medium should be male. Nevertheless, in spite of the persistence of the cultural idea that Thai Tsoo's spirit medium should be a woman, men took over the role in practice. Even at the end of the twentieth century, the idea of a woman holding the role of Thai Tsoo had not been completely replaced. In 1992, when I asked the man who was then Thai Tsoo spirit medium about female spirit mediums, he explained that it was hard for a woman to do the healing rite,</page><page sequence="21">Brown / Ethnic Identity, Cultural Variation 111 which included the kaixiang rite, because women cannot perform these rites while menstruating. (Here he drew on the Han cultural idea, wide spread in Taiwan, that deities, even female deities like Ma Tsoo, detest the pollution of women's menstrual periods.) This male spirit medium cannot be seen as totally opposed to female spirit mediums, as he trained two women who lived outside Toushe as Thai Tsoo spirit mediums for other locations. However, the ritual changes he instituted, in conjunction with his discouraging attitude toward the possibility of a female spirit medium within Toushe, helped to consolidate the role of Thai Tsoo spirit medium there as male. Thus, while the idea of a female Thai Tsoo spirit medium may per sist, the practice has not returned. In this case, the practice of men taking over the locally important role of spirit medium had a subsequent standardizing impact on ritual practices. Most notably, incense burners were introduced, altars were raised, the archi tecture of the temple was changed, annual festival songs were standardized (with other villages worshipping the same deity) by being written down, and additional vases and a white banner with Han characters on it were introduced. The Han name "Tai Shang Lao Jun"?the title for Lao Zi, the (male) founder of Taoism?was introduced as an alternate name for Thai Tsoo, a change that caused confusion among villagers about Thai Tsoo's gender. The male spirit medium also began practicing self-flagellation (a standard practice among Han spirit mediums in Taiwan).20 That men took over the role of Thai Tsoo spirit medium, despite the community-level cultural idea that a woman should hold it, provides a clear example that practices can spread not only in the absence of the associated cultural idea but even in the presence of a contrary cultural idea. Moreover, several aspects of this case suggest that practices spread more readily than cultural ideas. Men have remained as Thai Tsoo spirit medium in Toushe. A series of ritual practices quickly changed toward standard Han practices after men took over the spirit medium role (though not all ritual practices were standardized). Non-Han cultural ideas remained in the religious realm after the new, more standard practices were established. Additionally, although ideas associated with ritual practices did gradually move toward a Han model?for example, the notion that menstruation pollutes?some non-Han ideas on this subject still persisted even at the end of the twentieth century. An Unusual Case of Marriage We have seen that practices readily spread without cultural ideas, sometimes resulting in standardization but sometimes not. Ideas could also spread without</page><page sequence="22">112 Modern China the associated practice, however. A new and definitely nonstandard case of marriage occurred when a Han cultural idea combined with a preexisting non-Han idea, but it failed to spread across the population to yield a practice. One woman in Toushe reported that her minor marriage was uxorilocal. That is, her natal family adopted a boy to raise as a son-in-law, as their daughter's future husband. (In standard minor marriages, a virilocal form of Han marriage?once common in northern Taiwan but no longer practiced? a family adopted and raised a girl to become the wife of one of the sons in the family.) The woman had been reluctant to go through with the match (a sentiment predicted for minor marriage partners by Arthur Wolf; e.g., 1995), but neighbors persuaded her to do so. Their encouragement provides strong evidence of the disjunction between practices and ideas. In the early twentieth century, both virilocal and uxorilocal marriages were common in this community. It is not clear how the idea of virilocal minor marriage was introduced; perhaps residents heard of it as common practice in the Taipei area, or perhaps it occurred in one family in a Toushe villager's local net work of personal social contacts (which can range beyond his or her home community).21 However, introduction of the idea did not result in the prac tice of such marriage in Toushe. Instead, it created a logical imbalance between virilocal and uxorilocal marriage?virilocal marriage had both a major and a minor form, but uxorilocal did not. Since uxorilocal marriage did not carry a stigma in this community, one family ingeniously extended it so that it too had both a major and a minor form. Although neighboring villagers supported the practice of uxorilocal minor marriage sufficiently to encourage the reluctant bride, they did not themselves adopt the form. Here we see further evidence of the disjuncture between practices and cultural ideas and how that disjuncture can result in cultural variation rather than standardization. The cultural idea of virilocal minor marriage?necessary to explain the presence of this case?spread from the Han without the practice. By whatever means the family heard of minor marriage, it was undoubtedly tied to known virilocal practice?but elsewhere, outside this community. Because we see here only a single occurrence of this minor form of uxorilocal marriage in Toushe, it cannot be construed as a cultural prac tice; yet that occurrence is instructive, in that it shows that cultural ideas can spread without practices. It also shows that the spread of cultural ideas does not necessarily lead to standardization of practices or ideas. Evidence from these disparate sources about ancestral tablets, religious practices, and even an unusual case of marriage indicates the insights that can be gleaned from orthopraxy as process. All three kinds of evidence show a dis juncture between practices and ideas. In the case of ancestral tablets among</page><page sequence="23">Brown / Ethnic Identity, Cultural Variation 113 locals in Hubei and among Puyuma in Taiwan, their use spread (though not universally) without a concurrent idea that the tablets were a repository for souls. Men became the Thai Tsoo spirit medium even in the presence of a cul tural idea that a woman ought to hold the role. These examples show that the original adoption of a new practice does not necessarily follow from holding the associated cultural idea. However, in the case of an uxorilocal minor mar riage, the cultural idea of postmarital residence rules being associated with both a major and a minor form of marriage appears to have spread in the absence of the practice. Practices, then, may but need not necessarily spread first. More empirical research is required both to document how often prac tices spread before ideas and to analyze how such spread occurs. Nevertheless, all these examples make clear that the disjuncture between practices and ideas facilitates change. In the cases of ancestral tablets, other ideas became associated with the practice and evidence remained of non standard ideas in the practices themselves. In Hubei, ancestral tablets were a memorial showing exemplary respect; thus their distribution was limited, across the population and even within a patrilineage that had tablets. For the Puyuma, ancestral tablets were also a sign of respect, especially for in marrying Han ancestors, but responsibility for care of the tablets was passed matrilineally and ancestors too far distant from the living were removed in order to keep the number of generations represented constant (Suenari, 1994: 216). In the case of Thai Tsoo worship in Toushe, the adoption of male spirit mediums led to the adoption of Han-style ritual practices, thereby increasing standardization. Taken together, the evidence from these different cases raises several questions pointing to the need for more empirical research to assess whether standardization could really have been the force that held Chinese society together. Under which conditions did orthopraxy lead to standardization? Did different conditions lead to standardization of practices versus cultural ideas? If standardization required a narrow set of specific circumstances, how often did it occur? These cases also raise the question of what moti vates practices, since the driving force clearly does not have to be an asso ciated cultural idea. Here we are left facing a larger theoretical issue of what motivates individual actions, for the evidence in this essay casts into doubt interpretive assumptions about human motivation. Reassessing the Interpretive Canon According to the interpretive tradition so prominent in American anthro pology and other social sciences, individuals are generally motivated by</page><page sequence="24">114 Modern China cultural ideas, but the empirical evidence just reviewed shows practices not necessarily motivated by associated cultural ideas. Rather, as we will see below, further evidence suggests that structural factors influence practices. This evidence aids the r??valuation of the Han regional variation accepted within the claimed cultural unity of China and thus within what held Chinese society together. It also offers a Chinese contribution to reevaluat ing the interpretive tradition itself. The anthropological interpretive tradition traces one strand of its theo retical roots to Max Weber (e.g., Geertz, 1973: 5), whose book The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (Weber, [1958] 1976) is read as ulti mately attributing the origins of capitalism to personal belief in the Calvinist idea that God predetermined the fate of each person's immortal soul (as going to heaven or hell), independent of any actions taken on Earth.22 (This idea became cultural when it was sufficiently shared across the society, as Calvinism spread.) Because individuals could not live with uncertainty, they came to believe that hard work (the so-called Protestant ethic) resulting in economic success indicated God's favor and a subsequent heavenly fate. This work ethic thus constitutes the "spirit" of capitalism and its motivation. An underlying assumption of general anthropological practice is that if an idea or belief is shared among some significant (but unspecified) per centage of the population, then it must motivate those practices logically derived from it. However, as we have seen regarding ancestral tablets, a practice and a cultural idea (or set of ideas) can be linked by logic and yet not occur together. Given the clear evidence that the custom of producing and making offerings to ancestral tablets endured for generations in the absence of ideas about tablets as soul repositories and about filial obliga tion continuing after death, we may wonder whether these logically associ ated ideas are in fact post hoc rationalizations. Evidence of orthopraxy raises the larger issue of what besides those absent beliefs can motivate the produc tion of ancestral tablets and offerings to them. Locals in Hubei could explain the custom only as the local tradition (an explanation commonly offered to anthropologists worldwide). Further investigation of motivations in the process by which practices diffuse across a population is needed.23 Ancestral tablets were adopted in Hubei long ago, and no known records help us to understand why, but men's acquisition of the role of Thai Tsoo spirit medium occurred recently enough that we can reconstruct the moti vation.24 Consider Lim Mui-mue's refusal to take on the role, which appears to be a pivotal event in men's acquiring it. Lim herself offered structural explanations. She initially pointed to the very real possibility that she might marry out of the village, but the fact that she married within the village and</page><page sequence="25">Brown / Ethnic Identity, Cultural Variation 115 still did not take on the role weakens that rationale. Next, she claimed that her children were too young to be left alone. In analyzing this latter rea sonable explanation, we must remember that at the time, Toushe villagers lived in extended families with many people. Why would her children have been alone if she left them? Although Lim, unlike many women in her gen eration, did not marry outside the village, she did marry virilocally. Thus, she was not an outsider in her husband's village (since it was her own natal village), but she was an outsider in her husband's family. Marrying into her husband's household meant that she would have had to rely on help from her sisters-in-law for child care if she were to take on the role of spirit medium. (Her mother-in-law was Tan's assistant and so would not be home.) I think Lim astutely gauged the low probability of their support. Prior to Lim's generation, many women in Toushe married uxorilocally, including Tan, the last woman to hold the role of Thai Tsoo spirit medium in that vil lage. Had Lim been married uxorilocally?so that, as a family insider, she would have been asking her own mother or sisters to care for her children? her decision might well have been different. These considerations are not about cultural ideas; they are about social structure?where Lim fit into the social structure of the village and the power dynamics that that structural position entailed. Structurally, virilo cally married women were outsiders who could not expect the "special" consideration of help with their family responsibilities. Such sentiments may have come from daughters of the family or from other virilocally mar ried daughters-in-law who, as outsiders, had to watch other people's faces to gauge the acceptability of their own behavior (cf. M. Wolf, 1992: 95).25 Because the social structure was changing?marriages became almost exclusively virilocal during Lim's lifetime?Lim's circumstances, and thus her options, were not the same as Tan's. The case of an uxorilocal minor marriage can also be explained as hav ing a strong structural influence: the marriage form was necessitated by the family's lack of sons (A. Wolf, in press). Uxorilocal marriage was common in Toushe and, although it had less stigma there than in neighboring com munities, it was becoming more rare at that time. The family may have been worried about the stability of such a marriage. Virilocal minor marriage? especially when the child brought in to be a spouse was young at adop tion?was known to yield a strong attachment between a mother-in-law and her daughter-in-law (A. Wolf and Huang, 1980; A. Wolf, 1995), so why not assume it would produce the same closeness with a son-in-law? (Taiwanese were not aware that minor marriages had higher divorce rates; A. Wolf, 1995.) Structural concerns about a lack of sons as old-age support, and</page><page sequence="26">116 Modern China possibly structural concerns about the stability of an uxorilocal marriage in such changing times (i.e., whether a son-in-law would be reliable old-age support), led to the ingenious recombination of cultural ideas that resulted in this unusual marriage. If structural factors were so important, at least in these cases, why does Confucian culturalism focus on cultural ideas?especially given the increas ing evidence of more variation than expected in "standard" Han practices? Surely imperial bureaucrats were aware of such variation. Michael Szonyi's and Donald Sutton's evidence (in their essays in this issue) that local literati were aware of the nonstandard character of local rituals suggests that offi cials must have known about some degree of variation. That Han them selves were convinced of their cultural unity, despite "regional" variation, suggests that this notion of cultural unity might have been an ideology?"a conscious falsification, a conscious selection of some of the available evidence" over other evidence for political purposes (Harrell, 1996: 5-6n, emphasis his). Chinese elites (Han and non-Han) would have found such a unifying, assimilating ideology useful, just as more recent elites have found ideologies about national and ethnic identities useful to "mobilize people behind their political agendas" (Harrell, 1996: 5, see also Dittmer and Kim, 1993: 16-20; Gates, 1996: 148-51; Brown, 2004). Such an ideology could support a wide range of agendas: imperialist and colonial (to annex more territory), civil (to promote domestic stability), bureaucratic (to ensure accep tance of uniform rules and apparatus across all of China), and so on. Moreover, emphasizing the realm of ideas?as both culturalism and inter pretivism do?serves the interests of the elite because it diverts attention away from the structural constraints imposed by the social hierarchy (cf. Marx, 2000: 180-81; Gates, 1996; Sangren, 1995, 2000). Orthopraxy?emphasis on practices?appears to accurately portray the process by which the Chinese state (and others) attempted to promote both cultural unity and the notion of such unity. Although less cultural unity resulted than they might have hoped, they apparently did succeed in making people think that there was cultural unity. I suggest that promoting the ide ology of cultural unity while at the same time accepting a wide range of practices and cultural ideas as Han served the interests of the Chinese state. It rationalized the notion of a single cultural China and thereby provided justification for the assertion that a single state should rule a unified China. To assess this suggestion, we need to reexamine empirical data for evidence of whether cultural unity was promoted (and perhaps came to be perceived) not because culture actually held Chinese society together but because it justified the political and economic measures that the state undertook to</page><page sequence="27">Brown / Ethnic Identity, Cultural Variation 117 hold China together as a single society (see Szonyi's and Sutton's essays in this issue). If this suggestion is credible, then it would appear that what held Chinese society together in the face of much actual cultural variation were the forces in the political economy?including but not limited to measures taken by the state?that constructed China's social hierarchy (for an insight ful analysis of these forces, see Gates, 1996). Close analysis of evidence about orthopraxy as a process in late imper ial China shows a disjuncture of practices and cultural ideas. It suggests structural motivations for the spread of practices and for an ideological pro motion of cultural unity. The disjuncture and the structural influences, in particular, call for a reassessment of the interpretive assumption of the pri macy of cultural ideas in motivating human actions. I do not advocate aban doning the interpretive tradition. However, I do think the evidence warrants reconsideration of how often an action is motivated culturally. The sugges tion that structural motivations occur as well as?perhaps even more often than?cultural motivations itself constitutes a revision of the interpretive canon.26 While this conclusion agrees in part with Nicholas Dirks, Geoff Eley, and Sherry Ortner (1994), who criticized the interpretive tradition for not examining power (which is related to structure), it departs from them in keeping the interpretive definition of culture. Because the interpretive def inition requires that we distinguish between practices and cultural ideas, it enables us to see that cultural ideas may motivate some actions?such as the case of the uxorilocal minor marriage?but not other actions?such as the change of the gender of the Thai Tsoo spirit medium or the spread of ancestral tablets in Hubei. The challenge for future research is to document the different motiva tions. In doing so, we must elicit structural concerns (perhaps couched in social expectations) and cultural ideas from individuals, assess the impacts of each, and determine the relative frequencies of each in motivating action. Many anthropologists find that people discuss motivations in terms of social expectations?a practice is "customary" and thus socially expected. However, further elaboration of individuals' positions in a specific social hierarchy and networks in which they find themselves often indicates why different individuals may take different actions (Brown, 2003; 2004: 218 23).27 Ultimately, the goal is to explain not only how often structural rather than cultural influences come into play but also under what circumstances and why. Documentation of cultural variation?both across and within regions, including population frequencies?as well as close scrutiny of cultural change (cf. Watson, 1993) can address the issues raised here about the</page><page sequence="28">118 Modern China cultural unity of Han and the motivation of individuals' actions. Because China and Taiwan have undergone so much change within the span of detailed historical records and even of living memory, future research in these areas has the potential to contribute significantly to reassessing the interpretive tradition. Notes 1. By the "interpretive tradition" in anthropology, I am referring to the same authors whom Watson (1993: 82n7) cited as pioneering "the construction of culture approach"?primarily Geertz, Sahlins, and Schneider (cf. Kuper, 1999). 2. Watson used the term "Chinese" in reference to the ethnic category of Han (or Hua). Since he was speaking of the late imperial era, he was not referring to sentiments about belonging to a nation-state. 3. "Fluidity" here refers to a shifting of the boundary drawn between one identity and another in such a way that individuals and groups find themselves on a different side of the boundary without ever having changed their cultural ideas or their ancestry (see Brown, 2004: 13-19). 4. Chinese has seven mutually unintelligible regional varieties (e.g., Ramsey, 1987; but Norman, 1988a, suggests eight). Marriage forms vary widely in type and frequency across regions (e.g., Buck, 1937; A. Wolf and Huang, 1980; Pasternak, 1985; Stockard, 1989; Chuang and Wolf, 1995; Li, Feldman, and Jin, 2003). Relations between market economy and state power also vary regionally (see, e.g., Gates, 1996). 5. The term tujia has two distinct but related meanings that I distinguish by capitalization: tujia is the older usage, meaning "locals"; Tujia is the more recent term, meaning a specific officially recognized ethnic group of the PRC. For a more general discussion of Tujia, see Dong, Brown, and Wu (2002). 6. Elsewhere (Brown, 2001a, 2002, 2004), I analyze the basis for classification of locals as non-Han during the PRC s ethnic identification (minzu shibie) project. I argue that the non standard cultural practices discussed here convinced the outsiders from the central government who were assigned to identify ethnic groups that locals must not be Han, despite the earlier acceptance of them (by locals and Republican officials) as Han. Prior to the 1950s ethnic iden tification project, when no government official was responsible for labeling the population, officials apparently had no problem accepting self-reported or genealogical claims to Han identity. In fact, PRC assignment of locals to a "privileged" non-Han status was hotly con tested in Hunan by those who considered them too Han to qualify for affirmative action (Tian, 1994). 7. Ethnic labels in Enshi were relative and shifting. Thus, people considered locals as well as those considered outsiders wound up in both Han and Tujia categories in the PRC ethnic identification project. For a more complete discussion, see Brown, 2002; 2004: 169-90. Here, I use "local" to refer to the nonofficial, pre-1949 categories. 8. An anonymous reviewer suggested that Watson meant the temporary, paper soul tablet made right after death and used in the funeral and for a short period afterward, citing docu mented instances in which a permanent soul tablet was never set up for domestic worship, such as when an ancestor had squandered property (Ahern, 1973). This very example, however, underscores the strength of the expectation, for the pointed insult (or threat to future generations)</page><page sequence="29">Brown / Ethnic Identity, Cultural Variation 119 in not making a tablet for someone who squandered property only obtains if permanent soul tablets were the rule. Moreover, Watson (1988: 13) indicated that the soul tablet must be installed, and he specified that installation be on the domestic altar of the deceased's house hold. Thus, I think Watson was referring to permanent soul tablets. 9. An anonymous reviewer pointed out that ultimogeniture is a Tibeto-Burman practice. 10. Both regimes used these records to determine taxes and they, like the subsequent Qing regime, taxed Aborigine and Han households at different rates (there appears to have been no "mixed" taxation category). Given that taxation was a major source of income for both regimes, one would expect these records to be a fairly reliable representation of the population under each regime's control. Between 1650 and 1680, there are no known massacres or migrations of Aborigines on this scale, nor is there evidence of smaller-scale events in the numbers necessary to account for the death or departure of so many Aborigines, despite the extraordinary avail ability of historical materials for seventeenth-century Taiwan (see, e.g., Shepherd, 1993). 11. Historical records allow scholars to identify Aborigines, Han, Europeans, and often subcategories within these groups, but they do not allow systematic identification of people of mixed ancestry. Thus, reconstruction of the cultural practices of the mixed population must be inferred from materials pertaining to these other categories. Much of the mixed population likely would have been categorized as Aborigine under Dutch rule and as Han under Zheng rule. 12. My point here is not that no one in Taiwan ever placed graves inside a community (an anonymous reviewer reported observing a grave inside a community in northern Taiwan), but that the general rule and overwhelming practice was to place them outside community bound aries. This general adherence stands in contrast to the case of locals in Hubei, where the gen eral rule and overwhelming practice was to place graves within a community and, indeed, close to descendants' residences. 13. This estimate is derived from reports in ethnographic interviews: preliminary analysis of computerized household registers suggests that the rate may have been higher. Note that the figure covers only uxorilocal marriages of plains Aborigine women to Han men; the rate for all uxorilocal marriages was higher, as plains Aborigine men also married uxorilocally. 14.1 take the position that culturalism is an ideology of how Confucians wanted the assim ilation process to work; in my opinion, it does not accurately describe historical change (see also Ebrey, 1996; Brown, 1996b, 2004: 24, 29, 31). 15. He had kept the tablet hidden for nearly thirty years and never told anyone. His wife was shocked to learn that he had risked saving a tablet. He assured her that he did it only because they were "middle peasants," that he would never have dared had they been classified as "rich peasants." 16. A wizard told me that "ghosts are people who have died but they're not people with out tablets. They're people whose spiritual energy (qi) was not good when they were living." Then he said, "Yangqi buzou." Originally, I translated this comment as "They don't have enough positive spiritual energy," but that now seems incorrect to me. He said, literally, that their spiritual energy (yangqi) did not walk or leave (buzou). I checked several times (both with him and my research assistant) to make sure I understood his words, as I thought at first he must have said their energy was not sufficient (bugou). Given the purpose of the kailu rite, I now think he meant that ghosts are people?including one's own ancestors?whose spirits will not leave. Such a view is very different from standard Han beliefs about ghosts as souls whose descendants do not provide for them (and thus are like hungry, homeless beggars) or who died violently (and thus are like bandits) (cf. A. Wolf, 1974; Weiler, 1987; Watson, 1988). An anonymous reviewer noted that kailu is a Tibeto-Burman tradition.</page><page sequence="30">120 Modern China 17. Additionally, I suspect that their lack of mandatory involvement in rituals contributed to the very low status of Taoist priests in Enshi (I was told they were often illiterate). Their services were certainly more limited than in other areas, as they were not required for writing ancestral tablets, installing them upon a family altar, or, if need be, moving them. A literate person was needed to write the tablet (preferably a man with only one wife and with living sons and grand sons), but not necessarily a literate ritual specialist (who, locally, was a wizard, duangong or wushi). Taoist priests were hired primarily for funerals, at: least to perform the kailu rite. 18. Confucian ideology about orthopraxy would have us believe that practices spread first, and ideas follow more slowly. This view sets up an expectation that areas which adopt Han practices are on their way to Han culture. Thus a staunch supporter of this position could explain my observations that the ideas are not there by arguing that not enough time has passed; but how long is long enough? A major theoretical problem with such an ideology is that it assumes the same historical outcome for all societies encountering China?eventual acculturation and assimilation. It resembles nineteenth-century social Darwinism, which assumed that all societies were on a trajectory to replicate English Victorian society, itself assumed to be the highest form of civilization. Here, Han society replaces English society as the predestined pinnacle of human destiny. Such Han chauvinism claimed to justify Han polit ical expansion over millennia. I discuss Confucianism as ideology again later in this essay. 19. Only a few Toushe villagers reported the local use of "Alik Bu" by women spirit medi ums, and others did not remember that name being used there. (The deity was still called Alik Bu in another village in the area throughout the twentieth century.) Such a change would con stitute another move toward a Han cultural model. "Thai Tsoo" is an entirely (Minnan) Chinese term, and it is commonly used for other figures of worship in the Han tradition. Alik is a Minnanized derivation of an Austronesian term, and has no Han equivalent. Bu is the Minnan word for "mother." 20. Even two changes that arguably do not specifically follow a Han model show Han influence. The appearance of additional vases representing Thai Tsoo can be interpreted as mimicking the Han practice of having multiple images of a deity, and the standardization of songs for the annual festival can be seen as conferring greater status on the songs by creating a written text. I see these changes as fitting within the deliberate efforts by the spirit medium and his assistant to expand Thai Tsoo's influence?and, by extension, their own. Such expansion?including the establishment of new subsidiary altars?is a standard aspect of the Han folk religion (e.g., Sangren, 1988). 21. With the Japanese colonial period came increased transportation and communication from this southern Taiwan village to northern Taiwan (where virilocal minor marriage was common at the time), as evidenced by village household registers that show a few families with children who sojourned in Taipei. Danei township, in which Toushe village is located, had a low rate of virilocal minor marriages (Chuang and Wolf, 1995). 22. Weber himself said that he was much more materialistic than such an anti-Marxist ide alist interpretation of his work implied (Runciman, 1998: 4). 23. There is, of course, a wide sociological literature on the diffusion of innovations (e.g., see Rogers, 2003). However, it too generally assumes an interpretive correspondence between belief and practice. 24. The Puyuma adoption of Han-style ancestral tablets also occurred within living memory. Suenari (1994: 215) appears to favor "ideas about respect toward the ancestors" as driving the adoption of ancestral tablets but does not discuss such motivations in any detail. 25. Margery Wolf (1992: 110-16) also argues that outsider status prevented a woman from becoming a spirit medium, though under very different circumstances, in a rural Hoklo village</page><page sequence="31">Brown / Ethnic Identity, Cultural Variation 121 in northern Taiwan in 1960. The woman in question apparently claimed to be a spirit medium, but a locally prominent male spirit medium declared her bogus, which led some villagers to conclude she was mentally ill. 26. Such revision is actually more in accord with Weber, who argued for a motivational role for cultural ideas against the classic Marxist position that they have no role. Looking beyond The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, we can see he was suggesting not that cultural ideas play the only?or even necessarily the primary?motivational role, only that their role is potentially significant (cf. Runciman, 1998). 27. It is very difficult to collect empirical evidence about what ideas people actually have, let alone when specific ideas motivate specific actions. People's self-reports, after all, may not be reliable, and an external observer may not understand internal motivations. One danger is that the interpretations that make it into ethnographic accounts belong to the anthropologist rather than reflecting the shared cultural ideas recognizable to members of the society (cf., e.g., Geertz, 1973: 15; Marcus and Fischer, 1986: 16; Clifford and Marcus, 1988). Weber himself avoided this dilemma by basing his analysis on an "ideal type"?a form pushed to its extreme limits. In his view, the dynamics of an extreme (or ideal) type would reveal the dynamics that obtain in muted fashion in more common types. Today, having rejected the assumptions of an ideal type analy sis, we are left with the question of how to ascertain what motivates individual actions. Cognitive anthropologists have been particularly successful in developing such methodologies, analyzing word choice in relation to actions in order to understand which ideas may be linked to particular behaviors (see, e.g., Strauss, 1992b; D'Andrade, 1995, in press; Strauss and Quinn, 1997). Note, however, that they still assume that actions are primarily motivated by ideas or meanings. References AHERN, EMILY MARTIN (1973) The Cult of the Dead in a Chinese Village.
