<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN INTERVIEW WITH CYNTHIA OZICK Conducted by Elaine M. Kauvar Master of the meticulous sentence and champion of the moral sense of art, Cynthia Ozick warns against the "work of art as an end in itself" and urges instead its connection with humanity (Art &amp; Ardor, p. 206). Those artists who fail to see that the mission of literature is to judge and interpret the world are, from her point of view, idolaters who construct closed internalized systems, which instead of decoding the world for humanity are themselves served. In fact, Ozick main- tains that literature "is the moral life" and that the moral sense in art is both innovative and redemptive (AA, p. 245). All that Ozick avers radiantly informs her fiction, from her first novel, Trust, to the most recent, The Cannibal Galaxy. The indispensable purpose she accords literature makes it abundantly clear why Ozick deems reading "an act of imaginative conversion" and a book the "riverbank for the river of language" (Partisan Review, 51 [1984], pp. 771-72). The written word then constitutes the "primordial fountain of life," and it is in written language alone that true culture is found, for "Reading governs speech, governs tone, governs manner and manners in civilization" (PR, p. 769). For these reasons, Ozick regards the return to an aural cul- ture in our society as the "most significant loss of all: the widespread nurture by portable print; print as water, and sometimes wine" (PR, p. 769). Television and other forms of aural communication must be recog- nized as forces that have driven people away from art, robbed them of art's capacity for nurturing and redeeming the human spirit. Aural culture is a "free fall, a loose splash, a spill," and it can offer only an ephemeral and attenuated existence, one which eschews the impor- tance of written language for the emptiness of the spoken word (PR, Contemporary Literature XXVI, 4 0010-7484/85/0004-0375 $1.50/0 ?1985 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System</page><page sequence="2">Cynthia Ozick.

The primacy of the written word is why Ozick continues to object to interviews, for written language is exactly what they do not rely upon. When the present interviewer first asked for an interview, Ozick replied: "There is . . . a problem intrinsic in an interview. I have long been disturbed by interviews because, though they appear in print and therefore pass for something 'written,' they are merely a transcript of what has been extemporaneously spoken, often with faltering and stumbling. .... I have a standard of language for print; an interview, which is talk rather than language, by definition falls short of any publication standard" (July 2, 1984). A lively written debate about the value of interviews ensued, the interviewer stressing the value of spoken speech for spontaneity and discovery and the artist emphasiz- ing the "horrors of free conversation set down!" (Feb. 14, 1985). Even after the interview took place, the debate continued. Ozick declared, "But the written fruit of it ... it proves, doesn't it, that life is nothing without art. A mass of the inchoate, the barely realized, the barely spoken, the not-yet-visible. How it tells us the truth: that experience, no matter how intense, is nothing at all without the potter's hand!" As a critic, I argued that the interview is a genre that thrives on the freedom of interchange, on the artist thinking out loud, on the revelation of the artist sifting through ideas trying to arrive at what- will-be - all vital to an audience eager to understand and share in the process of creation. Nevertheless, when Ozick sent me her final cor- rections, she wrote: "But to see the words bare on the page! . . . The raggedness of a loosened voice. There isn't a grain of art in any of it" (Apr. 17, 1985). So artist and critic remain locked in disagreement about inter- views, the critic wanting to know how creation comes into being, the artist affirming the "only thing that . . . seems to matter: the under- sea place where language lies. Full fathom five it lies." No one who has read Ozick's work can be unaffected by the force of her imagina- tion or can gainsay the power of the potter's hand. Can an artist of such accomplishments generate "conversation [that] is air"? Q. Could we begin by talking about what makes writers acces- sible and whether it is accessibility that accounts for popularity? I am thinking, for example, of Eco's The Name of the Rose, a difficult novel that was a best seller. OZICK 377</page><page sequence="4">A. Oh, I see what you mean. I haven't yet read Eco. And I want to follow the mystery of that book because from everything one reads he's an artist, deeply serious, and a scholar and an intellectual. One hears he's spilled every density, every difficulty, into this book. And it's so - what a mystery: accessibility. What an idea also - density of purpose plus popularity. We know it used to happen all the time in the nineteenth century. I just read Persuasion yesterday. I think it's been thirty years since the last time I read it. My daughter read it on her vacation and left it and I picked it up. Talk about accessibility! I had forgotten how lovable it was, how marvelous. Everybody can read Jane Austen, and she's literature. And there we are. So why can't it be for Now? I'd give anything to be accessible. I am hurt when I'm told that I can't be read; I want to be read. Q. You were asked in another interview whether you thought the Judaism in your work is inaccessible to many readers [Texas Studies in Literature and Language, Summer 1983]. How did you feel about such a question? A. I was offended. It signifies deprivation. Judaism is a major and universal philosophy, and underlies the moral and intellectual foundations of Western civilization. To call Jewish material a barrier is to admit to vulgarity. Would anyone dream of calling Updike's Chris- tian material a barrier? Q. When you say that you want to be read, does that mean you're writing for a general audience? A. No, I'll tell you about that. I know it will seem like a contra- diction. It's true that I feel sort of stymied, stumped, and stunned, and in some way hurt, when people say ... or what my father used to say to me, "You can't be read; you have to be studied." My father meant it as praise; it wasn't a philistine comment. But the "general audience" blames the writer for not being an easy read. It seems to me that sometimes a text judges its reader rather than the reverse. At the same time, I really don't think about audience and I'm always amazed to find somebody who is interested. I do feel that when the manuscript is finished it's not fully consummated until it's published, and so when something is published, I have to read it through to be embarrassed by the inevitable typos and the horrors that happen. But after that, I'm finished with it. I know this is a contradiction- want- 378 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="5">ing to be read, not thinking about being read-but maybe because these aren't ideas, they don't require any logic. They're just feelings. Q. May we pursue the issue of Judaism further? How do you re- spond to the title of Louis Harap's article "The Religious Art of Cynthia Ozick" [Judaism, 33, Summer 1984]? A. I don't really think about the way critics will respond. One can- not be a critic for oneself. There's too much unconscious roil going on so that one doesn't know. One can't be one's own critic or one's own theorist or one's own reviewer. It's just not possible. But I sup- pose there is some truth in an essay that speaks of a "religious art" because since I was very young I've been tremendously interested in comparative religion. And I think that it's, at least for me, one of the most penetrating ways to decode the whole planet and the civiliza- tions on it. I know that the Marxists think economics is the only sound way to decode society, and there are other ways of decodifying the world. But this seems to me the ontological way, the philosophical way, because it goes to the root of every civilization. There's no civili- zation that hasn't had a religious aspect; until the world was quite old, there was no way to separate civilization from religion. I would think we can do that only for the last two hundred years. A person's religion was his civilization. It was his medicine, his science, his social struc- ture, his politics. I think that I in that way may be some kind of, I won't say a throwback or holdover, but perhaps some kind of steady- state person because I do very much see Judaism in its ontological and moral aspects as a civilization that continues to define how I am to understand my life. But that is not very isolating because it seems to me that all of Western civilization shares in this fundamental grain of culture as well. I'm not making any defense of the hyphen in Judeo- Christian, but you just can't have a Christian culture without under- standing that it is also a Jewish culture. Conscience is a Hebrew inven- tion. So in that sense I don't think . . maybe if I came with this claim as a Hottentot or as . . . well, I shouldn't be absurd. . . . I have a relative who is married to a monk, a Buddhist monk, but not your ordinary Buddhist monk; he is a Tibetan Buddhist. They live about thirty blocks downtown from here, and they've got a little Buddhist shrine set up. They're raising their child this way. And they are loyal to the Dalai Lama. She, of course, is Jewish. This relative-in-law is a very well-educated Buddhist who is, at the moment, translating Tibetan Buddhist texts into English to make them accessible to Western OZICK 379</page><page sequence="6">eyes. To give you just an idea of how the mind-set of a non-Judeo- Christian culture works: he spoke of remarkable texts and of the great codifier who simplified these densely complex texts. It's quite parallel in form to something in Judaism called the Shulkhan Aruch ("The Prepared Table," the name given to the code of Jewry written by Joseph Karo), a codification essentially, of vast amounts of traditional mate- rial. Now the great codifier of Tibetan Buddhism was clearly, as my relative-in-law explained it to me, a huge intellect who condensed an ocean of material into a jewel. Instead of saying what a stupendous mind, what an immense genius was required for this immense task, what a Maimonides, what an Aristotle, my relative-in-law said, "Well, it is plain that he was a reincarnation of the Buddha or he could not have done it." I was startled, and I thought: it is another way of think- ing. It is truly. That point of view would be isolating, I believe, in Western civilization, though it's endemic in the East. But to be a Jew in Western civilization is to be part of the foundation. Q. In view of what you've been saying, I'm curious about your response to Epstein's essay in which he calls you a "Jewish Writer" [Commentary, March 1984]. You wrote a letter to the editor stating that the phrase "Jewish writer" is an "oxymoron - a pointed contra- diction" [Commentary, May 1984]. A. My response there was actually a borrowing from Ruth Wisse. She makes a point that seems to me very important. I felt it because I spent about a dozen years lecturing and did a lot of it in Jewish com- munities all over the country. I saw that what was happening was that a writer was being asked to be a spokesman or stand as a representa- tive. That one cannot do. That's not the job of a writer. But when I originally wrote about the phrase "Jewish writer" as an oxymoron in my essay on Harold Bloom, "Literature as Idol," I had something else in mind. The substance is all in that essay and is fairly complex, though the complexity is Bloom's, not mine. I was responding to the Bloomian system. Norman Podhoretz, after he published that essay, once told me he didn't think three people read it. In fact, Podhoretz turned down the essay at first, and then miraculously summoned it back. It's there that I developed the idea of Jewish writing as an oxy- moron: the clash of monotheism with image-making, the poet as God- competitor. That's a very tough essay. It's really not my fault so much as Bloom's, since the categories and vocabularies are his. I heard he was distressed and impatient with me. Nevertheless, I find him more and 380 I CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="7">more readable. His essay in The New York Review of Books about the Pseudepigraphia, that's what restored us to good will. I thought it so brilliant and so Jewishly on the mark that I wrote him a fan letter. He wrote back and we made up. I think we're good friends again. He is extraordinarily inventive, an astonishing mind. Q. So you had two things in mind. Your objection to the phrase Jewish writer in your response to Epstein is different from the point you make about it in your essay on Bloom. A. My letter to Epstein was about a sociological point. Q. Now I understand. One objection is sociological and the other is literary. A. The sociological point wasn't really mine, but I've assimilated it now because I think it's important that the writer not stand in for whatever leads a civilization, whatever a civilization is invested with or consists of. The writer can't do that. The writer is not a priest. The writer is certainly not a leader. It's true that Tolstoy became a kind of priest or leader, but by then he was writing "What is Art?" and had repudiated all his novels. When I read "What is Art?" I have a great deal of sympathy for him. He's very compelling. But at the same time, would one want to accept the consequences of his ideas, and give up those immortal novels? I'm completely torn and in an unholy conflict between moral seriousness and its clash with aestheticism. And there's no solution for this. I think one has to go to the grave with that. Q. No solution? I feel that the conflict is less intense at the end of The Cannibal Galaxy, though it certainly hasn't disappeared. It remains in Beulah Lilt's butterfly pins, but still it seems to me that Beulah Lilt escapes being a system-builder. A. But she repudiated the Jewish cultural side of her education. She said she forgot it, and she escaped and ascended into the nimbus. She left obligation, the idea of duty, perhaps. She left a sense of a moral civilization. She became an aesthete. Her mother was not an aesthete, but Beulah became an aesthete. I can't become an aesthete, though God knows that when I'm scratching away at my desk and working on sentences I am. I wrote something about this in Ms. It's called "Excellence" [January 1985]. It's about scratching away at the desk. Q. And your essay, "The Question of our Speech: the Return to OZICK I 381</page><page sequence="8">Aural Culture," is about the importance of reading [Partisan Review, 51]. The essay is very reminiscent of our correspondence on parole. I wonder whether you'd like to say some more about that? A. Well, I'd like to tell you how sorry I am about the writing, which I think is like a stick. I was having a visitor at that time who I sus- pected was resentful of the whole enterprise of writing and so I felt I was pressing against his grain, against my grain. It was a very hard psychological time and the thing came out like wood. I think the prose of it is unreadable, like having your mouth full of splinters. Q. I didn't find it that way. In fact, I'm very interested in your ideas about the relationship of current language and the spoken word. Do you think our aural culture, as you call it, is affecting avant-garde critics? Has our written language become as "low"- the term you use in your essay-as our speech has become? Is the word narratology, for example, "low"? A. Oh, that's a terrible word. It's coarse. A circus barker's inspira- tion, out of the school of "Scientology." Q. Was the relationship of the spoken and written word on your mind when you wrote that you would like to inhabit Dr. Johnson for awhile [The New York Times, Dec. 2, 1984]? And are Johnson's ideas about the diction that obscures meaning and drives readers away related to your view of language and the writers and critics who use it, writers like Gass and Barth? A. You don't mean critics, then, you mean writers. Q. Both. A. It's a scary idea that I hadn't thought of. The idea that some contemporary writers are annihilating on the highbrow level the way television annihilates meaning on the popular level. That is an inter- esting idea. But Barth is different. The Sot-Weed Factor is a tour de force. It's beautiful. I'm speechless before it, it is so wonderful. He loves storytelling and his Scheherazade is witchery. I don't think he belongs in the category of the so-called self-referential novelists. I think he's been miscategorized in some ways even by himself. He has the comic muse in his pocket and he has a live literary sensibility in the most beautiful form. And I don't think that he's one of those destroyers or attenuators. 382 I CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="9">Q. What do you think of the postfeminists? Are they part of this structure? A. I think I see that, yes. They are fragmenting the meaning of literature by proposing the ideology of segregation. I had a heated wrangle with a dedicated Women's Studies ideologue recently. She brought up the journals of pioneer women. It's important that such documents are uncovered and in a sense rescued. But I think unless one can make a very good case for their being literature, then what you're dealing with is social documents, and that's part of history, and always has been. On the other hand, I suppose the case can be made that without the emergence of segregated women's interests, such things might have gone unnoticed or neglected. One can't be sure. Nevertheless, they've been noticed and saved and are uncovered, and that is important, whatever the source. Q. Elaine Showalter speaks of the "female literary predicament." Is there such a predicament? A. By and large I don't think there is one. I think that there has been one. Of course, the problem with saying there has been one puts you in a predicament now, because if you really believe that history is seamless, and that evolution is only technological and doesn't have to do with what we are as human beings, then you're in a spot if you acknowledge that things used to be different. But fresh from Persua- sion, I guess one has to admit things used to be different. Anne Elliot would not be an unemployed young woman right now. That's a kind of technical social difference, but the soul is the same and Homer and the Bible give us people whom we know. My daughter is now digging into Sumer, Mesopotamia, and Philistia, and she discovers the same spirit of humankind five thousand years ago. So to say, "Look at Jane Austen," and to say, "Look how different society was two hundred years ago," is something that one has to say, and at the same time there is no difference. I once read in Julian Huxley an idea that stunned me. I was still in my twenties. He made, I guess, what has become by now a very obvious point, that the evolution of technology, the developments in technology, result in evolution that inevitably alters the human mind itself. If you don't have to build a fire before you have your tea, if you need only turn a knob, then your inner life has been changed in some way too. It's not simply that you have more time, but also that your expectations, your human expectations, are different. In other words, we can manufacture our own mutation, in OZICK 383</page><page sequence="10">a manner of speaking. So I'm very puzzled about these matters and I haven't thought them through sufficiently. The social order changes though humanity does not. Surely this is mysterious. Q. Do you think the phrase the "female literary predicament" is doing us women any good? A. A writer is a writer is really all I can see and say. The assault on this position is - but you remember what Southey said to Charlotte Bronte? He said, literature is not the business of a woman. That's not quite verbatim, but more or less. And that's a hell of a thing to come up against. At the same time that a writer is a writer, there is this other ques- tion, and the other question is social. It seems to me that once you are allowed to get to your desk, a writer is a writer. But what about impediments that arise before you can get to your desk? I learned just recently that the two famous brothers Singer, I. J. and I. B., had a sister. A novelist. Q. Really? I didn't know that. A. It's rather like the story of Alice James, only acted out in the Yiddish language. It's quite sad. I just learned about the Singer sister recently. Everybody to whom you tell this says, "I didn't know that." And I said, "I didn't know that." She wrote one novel and several short stories. When she was a little girl she said to her mother, "Mother, what will I be when I grow up?" The mother was the literary intellect who was the genetic source of these writers, clearly. The rabbi father was not. The mother said, "Nothing, of course. You're only a girl." Her brothers regarded their sister as nothing, though they were tre- mendously supportive to each other. Bashevis Singer is always writ- ing about his late brother I. J., who is his hero, and he had this sister who very nearly doesn't exist for him. I became a feminist when I was five and a half years old, when my bobe (grandmother) took me to the cheder (the room or school where Hebrew is taught) and there was a very - at least then he seemed - very ancient rabbi, awesomely dignified, bearded, and formidable. He said to my bobe in Yiddish: Nem ir aheym, a meydl darf nisht lernen ("Take her home, a girl doesn't have to study"). We went home, and the next day my bobe girded her loins and took me back. I was in a class with a boy whose last name was Atlas, and we learned together. We were both beginners and we learned aleph-bais ("abc's") together. This boy was dumb. I remember us sitting side by side. It 384 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="11">was a big table, and the rabbi was opposite us. The boy couldn't learn. He was about six months older: he was already six. To me he seemed very much older. I couldn't wait for his turn to be over because I could feel the fluency coming and I could sense the rabbi's recognition that this boy was not agile and that I was catching on. At the end of the S. .. well, this is a very official word for the informality of a one-room schoolhouse . . . semester, when my bobe came to collect me and it was the end of the learning time, and I was going to go on to the next class where I was almost always the only girl, the rabbi said to my bobe, Zi hot a goldene kepele ("She has a golden little head"). That was the last time anybody ever told me I was intelligent for my whole school time until I got to high school, and since the praise came from somebody who was an opponent of girls' education, it was something that I held onto. It was very important to me because the Jewish home side of me was the part that was accepting and thought I was intelli- gent. But the school side was where I was hopelessly stupid. You know, in P.S. 71. I read the history book, the whole thing, on the first day of school, the day textbooks were distributed. Then I never opened it again. I was a natural speller and an obsessed writer, and in seventh grade grammar came like a revelation of bliss. But none of this mattered, nor was I ever made aware of being "good" at anything. I had no sense of being intelligent. I don't remember having teachers who cared about anything other than the "right answer." I disliked school; I was inferior there. And it was very strange to me to have two lives like this: on the school side, where I was almost always the only Jew, and in cheder where I was almost always the only girl. Then I went to Hunter College High School in the city. You had to get into that school by exam, half verbal, half math. The teachers at P.S. 71 were opposed to my taking the exam. They promised me I wouldn't make it. I got in by the skin of my teeth and into the bottom class. It was divided into levels A, B, C, and D, and I must have been the last to slide into the D class because the arithmetic was so hope- less. That school gradually over four years gave me a sense that I wasn't totally stupid. In that school they told you you were a Hunter girl, a member of an elite, and this began to have an effect. And so gradually I recovered; but I've never fully recovered. You never really recover from early futility and worthlessness. I've given some thought to my father. My father loved me; it has nothing to do with the withholding of any caring or love. But I think one of the reasons I felt free to say from earliest childhood that I was going to be a writer is that if I had been a boy, I would have had to OZICK 385</page><page sequence="12">go be something else. But it wasn't important for a girl; it didn't matter. It couldn't be taken seriously. It really didn't matter what I did because I was going to get married and that would be that. So I think that in a way being a girl gave me a kind of freedom to become a writer. My father did finally see that it was serious, that I was in fact pos- sessed. My mother, on the other hand, always knew it was serious. But the most hurtful moment of my life was when my father said to me once, "Other people's books and other people's children," at a certain point when I was writing and writing away on Trust and not publishing anything and having all my eggs in that basket and having no other eggs that were operative. P.S. 71 left its mark indelibly. I am always unsure. I always really feel like an inadequate dumb person. That's really essentially what it is, you know, somebody who can't ... you know, dumb. Q. It's curious that you feel that way because now people say that you're too brainy. A. That is so unreal to me that it doesn't penetrate any part of my being, not one pore has received such a thing, nothing. It's impos- sible to imagine. There's no way that I can accept that. Q. Are those feelings what made you put "Bloodshed" into a box for five years? A. I put a number of things into the box at one time. The story "Envy" was put away for a long time. I felt that these things were S. .. I know the word I used to myself was pedestrian. Yes, I had a very long, hard time getting published. Q. Was it Gordon Lish who talked you into taking your stories out of the box? A. Yes, that's right. He's a most generous editor. He was fiction editor at Esquire when I took the story called "An Education" out of the tombstone-box to which I'd consigned it. I wrote him a letter explaining in detail why it wasn't good enough to publish- a letter of rejection, in effect. He amazed me by rejecting my letter and accept- ing the story. And since then, I have felt my further good luck - the support, the nurturing, of Bob Gottlieb, at Knopf. Q. Do you think there is any way of reconciling being a Jewish woman and being a feminist in your sense of the word, a "classical" feminist? 386 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="13">A. Yes. I've written about Torah as the source of feminism, about the meaning of the human being "made in the image of the Creator" [Congress Monthly, Sept./Oct. 1984]. Actually, it's a talk I gave in Israel last summer at a feminist conference- a very political event. Elizabeth Holtzman and Betty Friedan were there, and members of the Knesset, and Shulamit Aloni. You can imagine how political that was. These were tremendous political fighters. It was a smoke-filled room, that's what it was. What is anti-feminism? It's using, it's seeing woman not as intrin- sically valuable, intrinsically human, but rather as an instrument toward another end, toward a societal end, toward a religious end. The world offers an infinite list. But it seems to me that the text of Torah itself is the source of feminism. Context and text and intrinsic support for anti-instrumentality. You mustn't use a human being. And this is what feminism is about. This is the heart of feminism. The byway, the mistake, the penumbra of anti-feminist error developed really through assimilation, curiously enough. In the Orthodox Synagogue, that mehitzah (partition in the synagogue separating men from women during prayer), that line of division - the anti-assimilationists defend that. Ironically, its origin is very late, and it comes out of an assimi- latory impulse. It came about in the tenth century under the influ- ence of Moslem culture. Apologists for the segregation and exclusion of women have developed all kinds of arguments saying these habits derive from the Temple, which had a woman's court, used once a year. Well, it's not historically right, it's not anthropologically right. At any rate, I don't find a contradiction between Judaism and feminism. Q. So you would still defend the position you took in your essay "Notes toward Finding the Right Question" [Lilith Magazine, No. 6, 1979]? A. Yes, but that essay was talking about contradictions, and even- tually I became disturbed by my conclusion. I thought about it for years. My conclusion was that it was in Torah itself that this scandal of contradiction was found. I was exposed to a lot of discussion about this and I learned from my critics, many of them erudite and thought- ful. And then I had a kind of a - you might say a revelation - of logic, and so I developed this idea about instrumentality. The idea is evolving. Q. Does that bring you closer to Judith Plaskow, who attacked your argument in "The Right Question is Theological" [On Being a Jewish Feminist, ed. Susannah Heschel, Schocken, 1983]? OZICK 387</page><page sequence="14">A. She attacked a part of it for not being radical enough by her lights, and the part she was in agreement with I've since moved away from. So we are probably farther away from each other than ever. As I understand it, she calls for a revival of a kind of pagan impulse, though she would deny it. She complains of male imagery in the liturgy, and wants to balance that by introducing female imagery. She wants to fight anthropomorphic metaphor by doubling its presence. She seems to believe that the need to "suppress the Goddess" is old hat, and that modernity has driven paganism so far underground that it won't do us any harm to introduce a bit of it into our present thinking, as long as it's good for women. It seems to me this is a position that allows sociology to leach into ontology. It isn't a resourceful position for some- one who claims the primacy of theology, as Plaskow does. The Jewish idea of God eschews anatomy, sexuality, biology - every form of anthropomorphism. The Creator of the Universe is neither male nor female. Plaskow wants to fix things up for women by making up a God who's both male and female. My view of this is if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Q. How are your ideas about Judaism and feminism related to your objections to Freud's theories? The name Freud appears fre- quently in your work. In "The Hole/Birth Catalogue," you argue against the validity of Freud's statement that "anatomy is destiny." But I have a feeling that your opposition to Freud is much more than hostility to that statement. Your objections seem more extensive. A. You are quite right. In fact, I began a Freud story once. It was supposed to be a comic story, a satire on Freud. I did a lot of read- ing - I read the whole Jones biography at that point. But I didn't get to many of the texts by Freud himself. I read The Interpretation of Dreams and Civilization and Its Discontents. Moses and Monotheism I read long ago, in college. My idea was to make fun of the Catch-22 of the Freudian thesis. I've since been educated by serious Freudians and I've learned to take Freud more seriously. My intention in this story was simply to spoof the all-encompassing Freudian system. According to the system, it's impossible to criticize the system because there's no way to escape from it, to stand outside as Galileo wished, outside of the planet - to stand aside from the planet of Freudian thesis and criticize it: because within the planet of thesis, your standing aside is judged as resistance, neurosis, all that. A system that allows no criticism from the outside seemed to me to be idolatry, again, that inescapable thing. In some very essential 388 I CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="15">way it is a corruption through arrogance when you don't allow ques- tioning, when critical inquiry is forbidden. Now Freud is nothing but inquiry and yet the essential inquiry, and I really mean essential, hav- ing to do with the essence of the enterprise - if you inquire about the essence you are drawn in by the web of the enterprise and there's no way you can escape from it. And so this is what I wanted to play with. I had a kind of fictional idea to demonstrate this idea. It was very complicated, dark, and playful. But in the end I abandoned it as too difficult. Q. It's interesting that your characters don't dream. Actually, dreams are absent in your fiction. The name Joseph Brill alludes, of course, to dreams. In the Preface to Bloodshed, you write that the story "Bloodshed" is "no more than a particle of dream, like 'Kubla Khan,' " but I'm curious about the absence of dreams in your stories. A. What a marvelous question! I don't know the answer. Maybe it's part of the general unsuccessful flight away from subjectivity and solipsism. Maybe it's wanting ... I'm just making this up now ... wanting more engagement and less going inward. Yes, it may be, maybe it's that. But I don't know. Q. In that essay in Partisan Review, you object to an aural society. Does Freud's method of free association in psychoanalytic treatment produce what you call the "spill" of aural society? A. How interesting. You're teaching me very interesting things in this exchange. Yes, conversation is air. I do think so. I never trust words that float in the air without being anchored in alphabet. (This includes my own words in this interview.) Q. Does Hester Lilt and her protest against the "prediction from earliness" embody some of your arguments with Freudian thought? A. Well, she is my childhood. The story of Beulah is me, the sense of having been written off. I'm not Beulah at the end, but I'm Beulah in school. Absolutely, Beulah is P.S. 71 for me, there's no question about that. Q. Then is the phrase the "prediction from earliness" your idea of Freudian predetermination? A. Yes. The Freudians claim that they're not determinists, but I can't see anything else. OZICK 389</page><page sequence="16">Q. In an essay you wrote for The New York Times, "Writers Domestic and Demonic" [March 25, 1984], you criticize the idea that neurosis causes low productivity. You argue with those writers who feel they need the "inner permission to write." Would you say that that essay is also against Freudian theory? A. Yes, I do believe that. I don't think the obstacle to writing is "neurosis." Although when I consider the kind of day I spent yester- day- a peaceful, quiet, long day in which I read Persuasion and let my manuscript just sit there because I was afraid of it, really afraid S. .. I actually had been separated from it for about three weeks, four weeks, and the break-in after a separation is very, very difficult. And the fear is so dreadful. Once I'm in and it gets a kind of momentum... Q. What are you writing? A. It's a short story now. I'm calling it ... I hope I finish it. I'm afraid even to speak of it because I don't want to jinx it. I'm calling it "The Messiah of Stockholm." I was in Sweden in October and had some extraordinary experiences there with the literary community and the Jewish community, two separate worlds completely, in which I was deeply saturated for a week. The literary community and the Jewish community never crossed, except in one person. The literary community was so nineteenth-century, so dreamlike in certain ways, parochial in other ways, so marvelous - a microcosm of competitive- ness, spite, envy, plagiarism, fury, anger, longing, beauty, inspira- tion, everything. But in a tiny, tiny community. It reminded me very much of the writers in Tel Aviv, actually, the same sense of being trapped in their language, the smallness of their natural readership before translation. Of course, it makes them brilliant translators. Their intellectuals are marvelous, marvelous people. But then intellectuals everywhere are. Q. It's interesting that you say that because your characters who are intellectuals seem always to fall into some kind of system: Brill's "Dual Curriculum," Puttermesser's "Plan for New York." Their intel- lectuality seems to alienate and isolate them. A. How interesting. Do you think they're isolated as Jews? Q. I'm not really thinking of their isolation as Jews. I'm thinking of their emotional isolation and specifically of your essay, "The Riddle of the Ordinary," where you praise the ordinary. Yet neither Putter- messer nor Brill is ordinary. 390 | CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="17">A. What a defect that is. Q. Is that a defect in them? A. Yes, I really regard that as a defect. It touches on what we were saying before. I don't want to be a writer of the idiosyncratic and the, you know, beyond the ordinary or outside of the ordinary. I deeply want to be, but I can't because apparently it's in the genes or some- thing - I want to be a social writer. I want to write about, not about these walls as separation, but about connections. As a reader, I don't want to read about someone's subjectivity, somebody's idiosyn- cratic ... Q. Idiosyncratic isn't my word. A. No? I'll take whatever word you give me. Q. I was just thinking that both Puttermesser and Brill seem not to have what you've called "ordinary human entanglements" in one of your essays. Is there a relationship between your essay and these characters? A. I don't know if I was thinking that. I know it's possible to make a demonstration through an antithesis: "This is what I don't mean." But I didn't have antithesis in mind. I wish I did because if I had had it in mind, if I could do dense human entanglement, human ordinari- ness, through antithesis, then I would be saying what I want to say; but I haven't said it yet. Nor do I think my current novel is going to say it. But I hope that the one- after I get rid of the current dybbuk ("demon") and if I live-I hope that after that I can deal with it. Q. "At Fumicaro" [The New Yorker, Aug. 6, 1984] seems different from The Cannibal Galaxy. It's certainly very different from Putter- messer and Xanthippe. Are you moving away from the novel of ideas into human relations? A. No, not yet. Not in the novel underway. I wonder, though, if it is an extenuating circumstance that I find ideas to be emotions. Q. Will we hear more about Puttermesser? A. Oh, I think I'd like to marry her off some day. I would like to have her married and normal. Q. So you haven't withdrawn from her? OZICK 391</page><page sequence="18">A. No, I think I want to call her back some time, but not for a long, long while. "At Fumicaro" is more craziness. The Catholic char- acter is a Jew. Q. Do you continue to define the novel as you did in the Preface to Bloodshed and in Art &amp; Ardor? Considering those definitions, who are the contemporary writers who write novels? A. Well, as I was reading Jane Austen I was thinking with much passion of another definition of the novel. It isn't original with me, however. Amos Oz, the Israeli writer, said it to me in a letter about The Cannibal Galaxy: "You've written a genetic novel." And then I thought, but that is what a novel is! Jane Austen is the flower of the genetic novel because we see how the mother has one set of charac- teristics, and the father has another, and then there's a slew of chil- dren and some are like the father and some are like the mother, and it's so delicious because we recognize life's truth in the way character is divvied up. I was talking to a friend about this and she said, "Would you call Moby-Dick a genetic novel?" Well, that kind of took the wind out of my sails. I said, "I don't know about the genetics of whales." No, one could not call Moby-Dick a genetic novel because that's a kind of mythomania. But surely the nineteenth-century domestic novel, including Tolstoy, counts as the genetic novel. And I would say that Updike is a genetic novelist to a degree. Q. Are you thinking of Rabbit Run, Rabbit Redux, and Rabbit is Rich? A. Yes, those are genetic novels. So is almost everything Updike writes. I would count him, and Bellow too, though he doesn't have a lot of generational continuity. His Herzog is kind of an insulated character. Bellow won't carry it forward into the future through the children, but it comes down from the past through the ancestry. So he's there. Of course, genetic novelists are accused of being excessively attached to nineteenth-century conservative modes. The people who do what I think you were talking about earlier, who want experience only, and call experience the text without refer- ence to society, I do believe that they are destroying literature. I think they are, and I charge them with the creation of idols. Because an idol - I said this in my essay on Bloom - is a thing that can only lead back to itself and hasn't got any connections outside of itself. It's a doll. And if there isn't this interchange of humanity.. .What is the 392 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="19">delight in reading a genetic novel by Jane Austen? It is not simply that there is self-recognition of one's tiny little immediate com- munity - there is also a portrait of a larger society. What distresses me about American literature is that few serious writers want to write novels about our country, this most amazing society of ours, this con- tinent of cultures. It's done only by secondary artists or by hacks who aren't artists at all. Leon Uris does it, Harold Robbins does it, Cynthia Freeman does it. But genuine artists don't venture into that complexity because it's no longer regarded as a serious undertaking. But what else is a great novel going to be about if it isn't about humanity in society? Maybe it's a Zeitgeist of narcissism that we can't escape. And the question is, do we create, does a generation of writers create that Zeit- geist, or are we born willy-nilly into that Zeitgeist? Q. That's an interesting question. A. It's a hopeless question, like the chicken and the egg. I really think that most writers are born into a Zeitgeist. Genius writers create their own Zeitgeist and that seems to be the difference. We now say the Age of Dickens. Before Dickens there wasn't an age of Dickens. We can say that because there was Dickens, and we can say the nine- teenth-century novel and the Zeitgeist of the nineteenth century because there were novelists. So I think genius probably breaks through the barriers of all convention. That's special, that's genius. But then how could we talk about literature in a serious way without confronting genius, because literature is only genius? Otherwise, it's simply writing. Q. But who are the readers of serious literature? Bellow has written against academics and for the so-called man of feeling. Aren't aca- demics critics - aren't they ... A. Also human? Q. Yes. Wouldn't they be more likely to understand the serious writer because the serious writer is difficult? A. Who are Bellow's readers? They are not the television people, and his novels are not for the avid readers of Harold Robbins and Cynthia Freeman. They're not, that's true. An elite of serious readers follows Bellow. Academics, yes, but also readers whose profession is not reading, who read in order to live. There is a small body of such dedicated readers - or at least one needs to believe so. OZICK 393</page><page sequence="20">Q. When you write, do you ever think about your readers? A. No, as I mentioned before, I don't think about readers at all. For a writer like me, do readers exist, or are they a Platonic idea? I was depressed in a conversation I had yesterday morning with Hugh Nissenson, who thinks that the form of the novel now is poetry, that the serious work of art in the shape of a novel is now in the same category as poetry, that it's very special, separate, elitist. And that's depressing, because novelists don't have the same aims as poets. I wonder if it's true. It might be true. It might be true because televi- sion gives everybody the complete satisfaction that novels used to, and maybe these satisfactions will never come through a book again. How terrible. Q. I can't accept that. A. I can't either, but I just wonder if there's truth to it. I think we've lost the common reader. I'm afraid so. Q. Then it comes back to who reads serious writers. Are they aca- demics? A. I think so, and what you might call private academics or pri- vate intellectuals who are not connected with a university. There is a small army of such people, and the case is made that they're often women. But I think they are also often men. Surely there is a nucleus of readers, but they are literary bluebloods. I mean they have special sensitiveness and they care for language. Well, this is insoluble. In my essay in Partisan Review, I did sound that knell of doom. Q. I'm afraid I have to agree with you. But as important as lan- guage and novels are to you, the imagination remains perilous and threatens idolatry. A. There's a lot of trouble in traditional Jewish life about imagina- tion as you describe it. Whereas in the examination of Bible stories, there's no trouble whatever about the imagination - consider not only the dreams of Joseph, but the lies of Jacob. Those fiction-making lies are quite wonderful, and this is something I have begun now to think about, not fully by myself, but with a brilliant genius thinker-friend with whom I've been discussing these things. I used to see the imagi- nation in very rigid terms as the enemy of the moral life and of moral seriousness. I now see something else, that you cannot be a mono- theist without a very deeply developed imagination: because you have to imagine, you have to envision and imagine that which there is no 394 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="21">evidence for whatever. All the other religions will give you something concrete. Buddha himself didn't want anything material; nevertheless, here are all these Buddha statues, deep materiality. Buddhism at its inception is agnostic the way Judaism is agnostic in the sense of agnos- ticism's refusal to state the nature of God or to give attributes to God. And Judaism, in Deuteronomy, right there in the heart of the sacral text, is agnostic, and will not state what God is. When Moses says the people are murmuring, they want to know who You are, God replies -well, the King James Bible says, "I am that I am." But the Hebrew says: being is being, or essence will be essence. The Hebrew does acrobatics with the root of "to be," and it's a non-answer. The only answer is to ask the question; the answer is that God is ontol- ogy. God has no Jewish definition; God is the question about the uni- verse. Deuteronomy says your job as a human being is simply to dis- charge your obligations to your fellow human beings-i.e., to keep the Commandments - and you mustn't think about the nature of the Creator. And that's what Deuteronomy 29:29 says: "the secret things" aren't our human concern, we can't make a portrait of the Unknow- able. This is the direction of a great, mammoth, volcanic high imagin- ing which in a fundamental sense really does set Judaism apart from all other concepts. Because in Christianity, theologically you may posit the higher imagination of monotheism, but also you have that figure, that male thirty-three-year-old figure, which is inescapable. You have that portrait: a baby, a male mammal. In nearly every other religion you have some figuration, some configuration, something that is recog- nizable and worldly and is seen in the earth. I mean from animism to Zoroastrianism - from A to Z! - you've got some form of matter, some literalism. Even in Islam, which inherited monotheism in its pure Jewish form, there is the remnant of Arabian stone-worship, the meteorite in the Kaaba. The figure of Jesus is, as it is meant to be, wholly material, mammalian. But in Judaism you have the greatest demand made on the imagi- nation, to imagine essence without attribute, without portrait - "I am that I am." so that to state a contradiction, a conflict, between imagi- nation and Judaism is really erroneous. Where the contradiction comes in is when you-I'm quoting Hester Lilt-stop too soon, when you speak of the imagination that creates things in competition with God, a thinginess imagination, an art imagination, a systems imagination, a mammalian imagination. The mammalian imagination results in idol- making. The higher imagination, the imagination that can imagine the unimaginable, the imagination that invented monotheism-this posits God. OZ ICK 395</page><page sequence="22">Q. So there's another reason that you could be very much at odds with Freud? A. No, I don't think Freud is talking about the nature of the uni- verse; he's talking about the nature of the human being. I would not be agnostic totally about the nature of humanity, certainly not physio- logically, medically, scientifically. That we know we can find things out, that's science. Insofar as Freud is science and can give us true gnosticism, i.e., faith that knowledge can be ultimately reached in areas where there is at present no knowledge . . then no, I am not agnostic. I'm willing to be gnostic about everything that is ultimately susceptible of surrendering its secrets, beginning with the nucleus of the atom, but I must be agnostic, and Judaism is agnostic, about the nature of God. About the nature of God Christianity is not agnostic. In fact, it derives historically from gnosis and the Gnostics. I always imagine having a conversation with Elaine Pagels about this. I'm curious to know what she'd say, with all her brilliance, about these contrasting values - the Christian daring to reveal a portrait of the Creator versus the Jewish refusal to do this. Q. Your vision of idolatry strikes me as being very psychological, penetratingly psychological. I wonder what you would think of that. A. I don't feel I have any gift at all for thinking psychologically. I know I lack that. I envy my two close novelist-friends, Lore Segal and Norma Rosen, so very much because they do think psychologi- cally, and they do think through experience, and experience is the source of their emotion. Though I claim human feelings, for me Idea counts as another mode of feeling. I am told this makes my stories cold, even bitter. I hope this isn't true. Q. So many of your stories are filled with photographs: "Shots," and even in "The Pagan Rabbi," the tree looks like a photograph. And you frequently write about photographs and photography in your essays as well. Why is photography significant? A. I'm drawn to the eeriness of photography, the way it repre- sents both mortality and immortality. It both stands for death and stands against death because it's statuary. It doesn't move. It's immobile like the dead, and it also saves. It's such a mystery. It's a mystery of a verisimilitude surrounded by, if I can use that word again, a penumbra of all kinds of unknown things. The past can stay, but it's only one split second, just a fragment which may completely misrep- resent everything else, all the other moments around it, or it may stand 396 | CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="23">for those other moments. There are so many questions to ask about any single snapshot. There's something so moving about finding an old snapshot of people one knows, one's own family. When I read biographies, I simply fall into those pictures. I think I spend more time drowning in old photographs in biographies than in the text. Q. What about "The Doctor's Wife"? Is the name Pincus Silver significant in terms of photography? A. Oh, Silver, Silver ... I don't know the name. Q. I'm talking about your character in "The Doctor's Wife." A. His name isn't Silver, is it? Was the last name Silver? I keep away from my own writing after it's completed, but I can't believe I've forgotten the name of a character. That's very strange. How odd. Well, I'm sure it doesn't matter. It's not related to the question. It's just that it's awfully embarrassing not to know the name of the char- acter. Here it is. This is the only place that it appears and I had com- pletely forgotten the last name. I wrote it so long ago. Q. Well, I just wondered because Pincus Silver thinks about "all the photographs of the mind," and he even says at one point, "All the photographs of the mind - out! All the photographs of hope and self-deception - out!" Does the photograph have something to do with illusion? A. The photograph of Unknown Friend. Q. Yes. I wonder whether that photograph is related to illusion, whether illusion is involved in your idea of photography. A. I haven't thought of a photograph as a commentary on illu- sion, but rather as an impenetrable commentary on reality. It's not illusion for me. But then, you know, one has to trust the text in that case, the tale and not the teller. Q. You allude frequently to Keats's Grecian urn. Is the time that the photograph captures related to the time the urn stills? Are time and illusion related in any way? A. I think of the urn as time at stasis. Illusion is something else. Illusion is what can't be seized, the opposite of fixity. What interests me about photography is the hidden reality, the gnosis of photography rather than the falsity of it, just because it's so damn literal. It's abso- OZICK 397</page><page sequence="24">lutely total reality. It's the capturing of what is, and in the is-ness there is God knows what. Q. Where does a sense of style come from? A. Style is craft plus something spooky. I'm struck by something John Updike once said. He said that no matter what he intended -he might have intended something entirely different - what came out of his pen was a John Updike sentence. And I find that true. I have many other intentions and everything I write comes out this crabbed Ozick sentence. That's just fingerprint or color of eye or brain snowflake or something. It's just something one can't help. Q. What about character? You say you don't have a psychologi- cal sense. I don't agree with you, but where do you think your sense of character comes from, from deed? A. I know the character before I begin. Actually, this is the only question that is kind of a craft question except it isn't really a craft question. It's a psychological question that I've given some thought to. A certain critical paper that arrived in the mail this morning said that I was weak on character and character development. I felt sur- prised at that and yet accused, because I feel that these characters are given to me and that I already know them. At the same time, they have the capacity to surprise me. They do and say things that I don't know, which is really the only joy in the hell of writing - when sur- prises come. Q. The difference, as you say in Art &amp; Ardor, between writing an essay and knowing beforehand what you think, and writing fic- tion where one "sets out with empty pockets from scratch." A. Yes, yes. Although in real essay-writing, one never knows where one is going either. Q. I like so much the walks that occur in your fiction: Putter- messer's "introspective stride" on Lexington Avenue, Rosa's walk on the beach, and Brill's "roundabout" way in Paris. All of these walks seem to lead to discoveries that are sometimes painful. Would you say walking is symbolic? A. How interesting. All these observations are revelations to me. All I can tell you about walks is that I find them, outside fiction, unbearable. Walking is very hard for me unless I do it with a com- panion and we're chatting away about something. But to walk in soli- 398 I CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="25">tude is painful because, as a nearsighted person, I don't like to look. I've gotten in the habit of not looking. There's nothing for me to see. I can't see the birds in the trees and so on. I'm left With that inner hum and I hate it. It goes pounding away and everything rises up and all the drek ("trash, junk, garbage") and all the inner, oh, what's the word? Dross, I think, and I'm left alone with that when I walk, and I dislike it. I'm frightened by it, the solitude. Q. But that's exactly what happens to Rosa, isn't it? A. Yes. Of course, I didn't notice that until this minute, or at least its relation to my life. Q. Another activity your characters engage in is letter-writing: Ruth Puttermesser writes imaginary letters, Rosa writes repeatedly to her daughter, Magda, and Brill's discovery of Madame de S6vign6 is central in The Cannibal Galaxy. How is writing letters significant? A. Letter-writing, alas, is my life. I write letters. I dislike intensely writing letters, but I can't work until I clear, not so much the desk, but my mind so that there's nothing left. I do all the domestic things first, and then all the letters first, and then the writing is utterly last. When I'm finished with doing the letters, I really have usually drained myself for the day and have lost that day. I have friends who don't even open the mail. I don't know how they quite do that. I don't know what the meaning of letters is, why I have to answer them, but I'm compulsive. I think I want to get rid of them. I want there to be noth- ing around. It's a kind of drive toward purity or singularity. I believe I have always been this way. My mother used to be annoyed with me; she thought it an inhuman thing. I've always wanted purity, and part of that is to be able to come to the real writing without responsibility, without owing. I have to deal with the responsibilities first so that I can earn what I probably regard as an illicit practice, namely writing, which is my whole life, which means more to me than anything, which in some way remains illicit, and for which I have never actually truly given myself permission. I do write letters, an awful lot of letters. Q. Do you write imaginary letters? A. I write imaginary letters. I sometimes wake up with this howl- ing, or quiet, or a voice just answering sometimes. Sometimes it's a polemical thing, sometimes it's a pleading thing. There's this near-mad voice within which is always, it's Herzogian. When I read Herzog, I thought, oh my God, that's part of the self, that writing letters to every- OZICK 399</page><page sequence="26">body. I think on Friday nights when I do the blessing over the Sabbath candles, that's also a kind of letter to the universe, a making rational of an irrational moment. So it's extremely acute of you. Q. You describe your characters' teeth. Teeth seem very impor- tant in your fiction: Xanthippe has a crooked tooth; Rappoport has perfect teeth, and Puttermesser has periodontal problems. Are teeth emblematic? A. Teeth are very strange, yes, if you look at photographs. There was a photograph in the newspaper last week of Reagan and Schulz and somebody else. They were all smiling. What struck me about it is that these are three heads and they all have sets of teeth. It really has to do with, I suppose, the physical sameness when one considers that each of us is in some way a solipsist, that all these solipsists are alike and make up a species, that we all have this - fascinating to our- selves - consciousness in which we live, particularly if we're the kind of people who have inner lives, and that even consciousness is repli- cated, just like teeth. There are so many of us all over one spinning globe. It's a kind of plenitude that I find very dizzying and deeply frightening. It's maybe what Mrs. Moore saw or thought about in the cave in Forster. It points to, it hints at, the side of religion that I, as a rationalist Jew, reject-the mystical side. Q. Oh, you reject mysticism? But mysticism appears so often in your stories. A. Yes. Make-believe is where magic belongs. I'm drawn to magical fiction. Jewishly, you know, I've been agnostic and a Mitnagid ("opponent" of Hasidism) as opposed to the Hasidism. I'm a skeptic. And I come from that Litvak tradition (i.e., the tradition as practiced in the Litvak, or Northwest, region of Czarist Russia, as well as Lithuania) also, of skepticism and inquiry and hard-headed antimys- ticism. Litvaks are rationalists. It's both my personal inheritance and my temperamental being. But as a writer I absolutely wallow in mys- tery religion. Teeth are an emblem. Teeth are an emblem of the same- ness that coexists within the terrifying plenitude. Everything is, any- thing that we can imagine exists by virtue of our having imagined it. I mean any idea will exist because we can imagine it. And the mind of God, metaphorically speaking, has imagined all kinds of things - the animal kingdom, the insect kingdom, the microscopic kingdom. Do you know that movie The Incredible Shrinking Man? What a philo- sophical statement! Oh, it's an amazing junk movie, but it's astound- 400 | CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="27">ing. A man gets a radiation wave passed over his body and he shrinks and he shrinks. His wife keeps him in the doll house: a fly comes and he fights it with a needle. Then he gets smaller and smaller and he finally enters the atom, at which point he's in the universe. This is the principle of plenitude, of the macroscopic and microscopic. But also, the abundance within the smallness and the abundance within the largeness and this whole thing that makes you crazy because it all merges. You could start with one tooth. Why do we all have these heads with teeth? Q. And with all of this you regard yourself as a "hard-headed anti- mystic"? A. In life. But in the life of story-writing, there are no bound- aries. I suppose you might say that I am myself an oxymoron. OZICK 401</page></plain_text>
