JENNIFER MONAGHAN Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 2005 504 pp. Since the turn to theory, no critic for literary scholars has resonated and endured with as much power as Walter Benjamin. His appeal is equal parts biography and thought: the urban flaneur and modernist translator; the period-hopping intellectual, as comfortable with seventeenth-century ba roque drama as with twentieth-century Marxian dialectics; the journalist beyond academe, struggling with Frankfurt University over his (rejected) habilitation thesis, before writing gnomic reportage suffused with learned allusion; the independent scholar, who never finished his magnum opus; the world-historical entrapment, with its persecution, escape, and tragic end as he fled the Nazis in 1940 and killed himself in the Pyrenees. The romance of Benjamin ?for certainly these anti-institutional roles appeal to higher-ed drones in the twenty-first century academy?is transmitted as well through a prose oeuvre that, while deserving a career of deep en gagement, is perhaps best read for its aphoristic lyricism, rich with impli cation. In "Theses on the Philosophy of History"?one of his last works, written in 1940 before the fateful trip from Paris to the Spanish border?Benjamin {657</page><page sequence="2">658} EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 44, NUMBER 3 posited a historical method that unsettled the categories of both "past" and "present" typical of traditional historiography.1 If history is the writing of the relations of these categories, Benjamin questioned how we summon up the past and what that knowledge means in the present. Resisting a positivist orientation that would capture the past "as things really were" and a developmental orientation that would capture the past as it exists on a continuum with the present, Benjamin instead proposed an alternate temporality when doing history, one not as naive as the positivist nor as progress bound as the developmentalist. Landmark restoration might be a way to illustrate these orientations and time schemes. The Thaddeus Kosciuszko house in Philadelphia fea tures tourist signage that explains its rebuilding. On the sign, a photograph from 1975 shows the ruined house, with a caption and arrow indicating the "original historic brickwork at corner." In the same photo, another caption laments later additions, and, with arrow, directs viewers to the supposed eyesores and to the steps taken: "remove non-historic brickwork and re store original brick pattern." Such a desire for "historic" brickwork reflects both of the temporalities of traditional historical method. In its quest, it offers an authentic past based on original construction material as it really was, and, in its practice, it creates a homogenizing parade of history, from past to present. In fact, it creates this latter developmental temporality?a seamless recognition of antecedents, a Whiggish, high-living confirmation as we moderns look back?by slighting, dismissing, or repressing the later bricks as "non-historic." Benjamin reframed the discussion by offering a method shot through with messianism. This method would abandon the pastness of the past im plicit in positivism while exploding the continuum of history presented by the developmentalists. In Benjamin's time zone, the historian would, in a fair bit of bombast, redeem the past for the present. His take on the relations of past and present was not solely an echo of Vico's tropology nor of Croce's dictum that "all history is contemporary history" ? pre postmodernists who understood the mediating influence of the present on the past. In redeeming the past for the present, Benjamin called the homo geneity of traditional history "empty time" and contrasted it with what he called "now-time." "Empty time" is that narrative temporality we default to when writing up a story of the past as one of continuity and change, where we amass data and look for cause-and-effect. "Now-time" is a col</page><page sequence="3">Review Essay: History of the Book { 659 l?ge temporality, where the past clutters the present. The past's traces and crystallizations sunder the developmental logic of history writing, arrest the present moment with a constellation of such traces that shock rather than soothe, and, properly read, provide means of deliverance. Benjamin worried that, in the default temporality of traditional narrative history, the heterogeneity of the past was lost. In fact, such narratives of continuity and change need "non-historic" materials to define their project as "historical." At the Kosciuszko house, Benjamin would have cared about those later bricks. In a famous passage from "Theses" that suggests the beauty possible in cultural criticism, Benjamin commented on a Paul Klee painting in such terms: There is a picture by Klee called Angelus Novus. It shows an angel who seems about to move away from something he stares at. His eyes are wide, his mouth is open, his wings are spread. This is how the angel of history must look. His face is turned toward the past. Where a chain of events appears before us, he sees one single catastrophe, which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it at his feet. The angel would like to stay, awake the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise and has got caught in his wings; it is so strong that the angel can no longer close them. This storm drives him irresistibly into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows toward the sky. What we call progress is this storm. (Selected 392) In the diction of ruins, wreckage, and fragments, in figures such as the angel of history or the automaton and the puppet, Benjamin made "Theses" itself a punchy collage, which evoked and argued in sentences by turn. Its figures could fail, such as a terribly sexist bordello image, which reveals enough about modernism's straight male panic. This rhetoric and Benjamin's poli tics tell us more about the method, of course. Strongly critical of master narratives of history, including Marx's, Benjamin shared a Marxist's radi cal leanings: he sought redemption and deliverance for the oppressed. This ambivalence accounts as well for his current academic appeal no doubt. The method is as attitudinal as it is procedural. Such a method is embedded in another figure from "Theses," that of the "tiger's leap." If "[h]istory is the subject of a construction whose site is</page><page sequence="4">660 } EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 44, NUMBER 3 not homogeneous, empty time but time filled full by now-time," then, for Benjamin, the historian's angle of approach might learn from revolution ary actions alert to this temporality (Selected 395). In a pairing typical of Benjamin's sensibility, both Robespierre and the fashion industry under stand the past in now-time. The French Revolution "cited ancient Rome exactly the way fashion cites a bygone mode of dress. Fashion has a nose for the topical, no matter where it stirs in the thickets of long ago; it is the tiger's leap into the past" (Selected 395). The angel of history is passive, plaintively unable to help, blown as it is by the storm of progress. The tiger's leap is the antidote, the active and indeed aggressive attention to the clutter of now-time and its crystals from the past. History can be construed in all kinds of ways?written by the winners; wanting a usable past; a function of a dialectic; retro kitsch; instruction for the future; to be transcended. I take this detour through method as a means of entry into two disparate works of American book studies and to alight on Benjamin's name for his method, "historical materialism." If we understand this as the traditional Marxist concern with the material conditions of a culture, thus providing the springboard for any humanities or social-science inquiry?the economic base through which we interpret a superstructure of ideas and policy?then that is probably the least we know of Benjamin. While historical materialism might describe any num ber of initiatives in cultural studies treating the past that rely on Marxist or post-Marxist analysis, it seems equally to apply to the history of books as a field of study, which, in its current institutional position, orients much of its work toward the "materiality" of word and image in their printed, written, and spoken media. Yet like history, materiality can be construed in all kinds of ways. It has a range of meanings. A 1630s Cambridge educator could refer to "Materiall, as Passions, whereon our vertues must worke," one of four causes of individual action within an ethical sphere (Pemble 2). On the other hand, an early modern philosophy of science influenced by Cartesian mechanism would understand materiality as matter ceaselessly in motion. Libidinal passion and invisible motion are not the first things that come to mind when the term is employed by book historians. We might glean the current state of book history by considering two important monographs in the light of historical materialism's multiple va lences, sharpening our sense of a Benjaminian impulse within the field while also beginning to query what matters in book studies discourse. His</page><page sequence="5">Review Essay: History of the Book { 661 Klee rumination an opening epigraph, Walter Benjamin seems the muse of Trish Loughran's The Republic in Print, with its language of fragments, its ruptured time line, and its strident take on American history's master narratives. Loughran's is the tiger's leap that would crack open received wisdom about early national political culture and its relationship to print ing and reading. E. Jennifer Monaghan's Learning to Read and Write in Colonial America tacks differently. With patience and clarity, Monaghan excavates reading practices from the prenational sites of New England, the mid-Atlantic, the Chesapeake, the South, and the contact zone of mis sionary work. In so doing, she evinces a loyalty to traditional historical method, an approach attitudinally quite different from Loughran's. Learn ing to Read and Write in America paws at the past, with a determination that is dogged in its best senses: persevering, steadfast, intent. A dog's pawing lacks the glamour of a tiger's leap; a tiger's leap lacks the staidness of a dog's paw. Can these positions be reconciled? Labeled "the New Boredom" by its advocates, book history simply may be a glamorously staid research initiative. But these tropes also help us see how evidence is generated?how matter is made ?in the respective methods of leap and paw and what that evidentiary pay-off?the mattering, if you will ?might mean for book history In their style and proof, each monograph con cerns itself with the materiality of book history Yet despite "materiality"'s standing as a popular buzzword for book history (perhaps because of it), few terms so central to an area of inquiry have been so underexamined. Through an exploration of mattering?by which I mean both the nature and the production of evidence in the field of book history?I will begin to take up the question of materiality via the works of Loughran and Mona ghan. In the heyday of the New Historicism, Carolyn Porter published an article entitled "Are We Being Historical Yet?" Porter's answer was "No." The works under review prompt a similar question for book-based scholar ship, in keeping with the theme of mattering and thus asked in a less rhe torical, more open-ended key: are we being materialist yet? Put most generally, The Republic in Print's agenda is to debunk the myth of a print culture that provides coherence for a community and thus fosters the sense of a unified nation. While it promises a date range of 1770-1870, it focuses in detail on the publications and nation-emergent politics of the Revolutionary and Federalist era (1770-1800) and on the ramified print</page><page sequence="6">662} EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 44, NUMBER 3 culture and abolitionist-oriented politics of the 1830S-1850S. With this pur view, its aims are twofold: to "consider the problems inherent in the ab stracted model of the print public sphere that currently underwrites our understanding of early American print culture" and to trace "the nation state itself as a material and historical form that emerges across time from its own theorized origins (in constitutional federalism) into an actual infra structure embedded in real institutions: a nation" (xix). The pairing of time periods allows the book to press home an argument: that the 1770-1800 period was local, conflictual, and messy, hardly the imagined community of a larger national realm, and that, when by the 1830S-1850S period an integrated print culture might serve a nation-building coherence, the na tion in fact imploded in civil war. The hopfrogging periodization ?a ver sion of the tigers leap ? and the print culture orientation are conjoined to a method that partakes of the geographical turn in recent humanities work, where space and "spatiality" (through maps, travel, and empire) are objects of study. Through investigation of nationalism and printing, licensed mo bility and fugitive movement?of texts and persons?becomes the subject of The Republic in Print. After an introduction that critiques the monolithic print culture thesis ? promising in its stead an account of print's "provincial and plural nature" in the early republic and its transformation into a medium coordinate with cross-regional exchanges enabled by infrastructure development and the market revolution (23-24) ?Loughran takes aim at Thomas Paine's Com mon Sense. Contemporary propagandists and the pamphlet's nationalistic reception history to this day have overstated the work's bestseller status. There's no demonstrable documentation to support the reprint numbers hyped?then and now?for Common Sense. One appreciates the biblio graphical caution here, but Loughran nevertheless cites evidence ?in an effort to minimize it ?supporting the pamphlet's influence. No matter. Complicit with "its own widely heralded circulation," Common Sense had Paine producing "a new way of thinking about the extended colonies that would neutralize the deeply appealing but divisive rhetorics of local at tachment while offering a convincing model of the continent as an au tonomous (and nonimperially integrated) unit" (58, 72). Paine rhetorically anticipated Federalist ideology, the bete noire of the following chapters. The Federalist papers and the Constitution's ratification process are thus held up to similar scrutiny, with the essays a "trick" projecting "the fic</page><page sequence="7">Review Essay: History of the Book { 663 tion of a far wider public" when in fact the incommensurable gaps of the early republic ?evidenced, according to Loughran, in the informationally challenged ratification debates from state to state ? illustrate the distance between Federalism 's wished-for mass nationalism and ratification s "con tingent, disconnected, and above all partial process" (121,120). With reference to John Trumbull's Declaration of Independence paint ing and Royall Tyler's The Contrast, the next chapter intends to measure Federalist notions of nation making in the face of more entrenched local ism, across the 1776-1787 stretch, the endpoints of which ?the Second Continental Congress and the Federal Convention ? some of us, it seems, conflate too easily No matter. Trumbull traveled over space and time to render the moment of signing, only completing the image in 1818; we have proof, if we needed it, of how years passed between 1776 and 1787 and thus how the founding is not "self-identical" (165). Resisting a national ist reading that can attend The Contrast, Loughran sketches the regional performances and highlights the regional ties of characters, with the New York setting an especially localized arena. Yet the play's energy bespeaks a "unionizing telos" (193) that participated in Federalist ideology, an ideol ogy that managed cross-regional tensions into a larger national coherence and whose political economy embraced virtual representation over actual representation. Loughran follows with a nicely conceptualized analysis of Christo pher Colles's surveying, The Federalist, the Constitution, and William Hill Brown's The Power of Sympathy, arguing that "the federalist project thus amounts to the successful, if unlikely, conquest of both space and time by a theory, a consolidation, on a mass scale, of both territory and history?the very matrix of what it means to be a nation" (226). The chapter then reads the rhetoric of scale, tiered structure, and distance in these various texts. Each grappled with Madison's "extended republic," now understood as something more than balanced factionalism. What Colles's maps aspired to and what The Federalist and the Constitution achieved?comprehensive hierarchies controlling persons amid dispersed places ? The Power of Sym pathy partly dismantled and partly reinforced. Brown's politics, the prolif eration of settings, sympathy's perverse, self-regarding pleasures, the logic of inheritance ?all serve a novel ambivalent about the space and time of Federalism, its territoriality, origins, and perpetuity. Almost all aspects of early national print culture from 1800 to 1830 are</page><page sequence="8">664} EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 44, NUMBER 3 then bypassed. No matter. The book attends to the movements for grad ual and immediate abolition, in a time period beyond this journal s scope. The immediatist approach and the American Anti-Slavery Society (AASS) from 1833 forward mounted "a geographical critique--a critique both of emerging U.S. nationalism and of federalism's spatial legacy to antebel lum America: the extended republic" (306). If by the 1830s the progress of infrastructure, a culture industry, and vast markets now produced a more integrated nation, a gradualist like Benjamin Lundy (1789-1839) is a transi tional figure for the argument, a reminder of preindustrial relations of pro duction and circulation. Lundy lacked the centralized power of later abo litionists and thus hearkened back to the locally inflected dynamics of the early national United States. This is demonstrated in his hand-delivered (rather than mailed) writings, his colonization-driven travels, and his mis cellany of a printed life story (though book historians would note that com pilation is typical of one of the most widely read life stories of the nine teenth century, Benjamin Franklins). A final chapter places Uncle Toms Cabin, Twelve Years a Slave, and Clotel in the grid of "the collapsed nation space" brought on by consolidation and asks "how people came to identify with and be identified as mobile individuals rather than geographically fixed citizens" (366, 369). According to earlier chapters, Paine, Trumbull, Collier, and Lundy were all definitively mobile, so the terminology here becomes inconsistent. Further, the shift to a history of bodies and selfhood is unexpected and begs questions of the works historiography.2 Corpore ality and "American identity" have been submerged as topics of historical investigation in the 363 pages prior to this chapter, so the discussion of a body-based self requires a larger contextualization. Loughran deserves praise for taking a valuable insight from book trades research ?the persistent, endemic localism of what production and con sumption of the written word there was in early America ?and giving it its due. The work also helpfully joins a media ecology of the period that has corrected theories of reading-based nationalism. But The Republic in Print wobbles when one looks outside the construct of its argument. For instance, the theme of national integration in potentia ? whether in the world of Federalist ideas or in the world of industrial printing ?is not always persuasive when seen in terms of intellectual or religious history. A Federalist victory in the war of ideas, which pedals much of the argument, is incongruent with the abiding discourse of regionalism and sectionalism</page><page sequence="9">Review Essay: History of the Book { 665 available to early nationals ?an extant discourse of ideas coeval with the localist realities of the early republic.3 Industrial printing in the service of a nation-building coherence during the market revolution finds its example in the AASS; but, as culture industries go, this abolitionist group hardly compared with either the American Tract Society or the American Bible Society (an observation shuffled to an endnote). The ATS was itself larger institutionally than the federal government in the 1840s. The Republic in Print dodges the crucial question of determination, of why the AASS be comes an emblem of print culture's ability to potentially unite a nation. The communications networks of the ATS and ABS make for better analogies with the Federalist project of consolidation, belie the claim for the AASS's centrality as a culture industry, and bring with them equally vexed ques tions of nation building.4 The Republic in Print is overwritten, which weakens the force of the argument and buries its best findings. Sentences love their adverbs; tran sitional paragraphs hyperventilate; individual paragraphs pile up verbiage; intertitles draw inordinate attention to themselves. It occasionally reads, in fact, like the product of an oral culture: that is, like the extemporizing lecture notes of an American literary history survey, with digressions and asides that call on syllabus readings and with statements that endlessly re peat general themes, as if reminding undergraduates what will be on the essay section of the final exam. These are necessary gestures for a semester long lecture class, but they wear on the reader of a monograph. This is a shame, because what gets lost in the prose style are splendid archival finds and effective interpretation: the print existence of Benjamin Lundy, the formatting of The Power of Sympathy, a brilliant reading of references to statuary in The Contrast, and the doctored cover art to the mass market paperback edition of The Federalist papers, to name a few. It could be half as long and twice as strong. I like polemic as much as the next academic and certainly the profes sion does not lack for long-windedness. But polemic works best when it is earned and in fact this larger criticism of rhetorical strategy returns us to the methodological and evidentiary themes with which I began. The inter section of prose style and research is no mere aesthetic concern. Consider the hammering incantation of, ironically, the word "materiality" and its kin "material" and "materialist" in The Republic in Print. I began counting the references to it by hand, then hoped for one of those Amazon.com cloud</page><page sequence="10">666} EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 44, NUMBER 3 concordances, then gave up this quantifying tic. Believe me, Loughran is not shy of using the term. As with other strings of generalized abstraction in the book, at these moments of pronouncement there is no matter. The hyperbolic emphasis in such repetitions undercuts the analysis: when The Republic in Print repeatedly proclaims its material orientation it actually obscures its material discoveries. It protests too much. Are we being ma terialist yet? The question of method might be better posed as a question of disci pline (a much-maligned concept in our Foucauldian and post-Foucauldian moment). In this more redemptive view of discipline, each of our writers approaches the past as subject to training or, troping the trope, as an ani mal to be oriented. From this perspective, Loughran s challenge is to cage the leaping beast that is early national political culture, to subdue the roar of the framers and their mythographers. Discipline of this sort is certainly understandable, given the veneration that attaches to the founding. Treat ing historical actors who draw less attention to themselves, E. Jennifer Monaghan works differently, not with chair to maw but with voice to ear, a mode best captured by poet and essayist Vicki Hearne. In Adams Task: Calling Animals by Name, Hearne's interest is dog training and she finds in such interspecies relations ways of learning that benefit both trainer and trainee. A calm polemic in favor of discipline, Hearne's brief is to chal lenge not only anthropomorphic attitudes to pets but also the larger sen timental culture that promotes "niceness" as an ideal of social relations. For Hearne, an ethic of kindness has more to do with being true to the kind of other being you are involved with, to be true to its nature. Better put: to help it discover its nature. With the trainer's ear equally turned to the trainee's voice, Hearne flirts with how much we are to carry this ethic over to interpersonal relations. As a description of discipline, however, it appears uncontroversial, applicable to procedures such as bread baking, piano playing, or history writing. Monaghan would seem to believe in this kind of discipline: loyal to the past, she also learns it, permitting it to yield its truths. Learning to Read and Write in Colonial America belongs to the genre of monograph that might best be labeled book trades research, remarkably exhaustive studies such as James Raven's The Business of Books, Richard Sher's The Enlightenment and the Book, and Ian Green's projected trilogy</page><page sequence="11">Review Essay: History of the Book { 667 on early modern religious publishing. Literature professors who call them selves book historians might think twice in the face of such monumental and careful works. That said, the tendency in such works is to treat the printed and written word as a commodity more akin to cloth or sugar, rather than as an interpretable sign-system shuttling (or not) through a variety of economies. Monaghan implicitly addresses this potential impasse with her canny focus on the history of reading, which has her both tracking shipments and meditating on hermeneutics. While Learning to Read and Write in Colonial America pursues a traditional historical method ?graft ing its findings on to dominant narratives established by leading historians of early America?the discoveries often bloom into stories of uncommon power. If Loughran strains to leave us shocked, Monaghan, in the default framework of history writing, lets details emerge that provide genuine sur prise. Retrieving the importance of literacy instruction ?which, for the au thor, had been in previous scholarship either restricted to formal education or diluted by attention to multiple educating agencies ?Monaghan divides her study into three parts, covering the historical periods 1620-1730,1730 1750, and 1750-1776. She coordinates this periodization with Jack Greene's model of British American society's evolution in the colonial era and with Timothy Breen's model of marketplace development and consumerism up through 1776. Her brief is to integrate the long-recognized improvement in signature literacy rates over the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries with changes outlined by Greene and Breen: first, the parallel growth and cultural convergence of individual colonies through settlement and steady prosperity, such that an independent nation could be formed, and, second, the aspiration and achievement of "gracious living" (5), the enactment of that prosperity in the acquisition of household goods and luxury items. Monaghan substantiates this thesis through data gathered by book histori ans and through a keen eye to the sociological vectors of access prescribed by roles of gender, race, class, faith, and region. Titled "The Ordinary Road," part 1 traces the predominantly religious instruction transmitted by Congregational and Anglican approaches to lit eracy training. That ordinary road consisted of a reading sequence in the devotional context, a graduated method moving through "the Horn-Book, Primer, Psalter, Testament, and Bible," in John Locke's words. For the Con gregationalists, reading ?especially as adopted by the young?was a cru</page><page sequence="12">668} EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 44, NUMBER 3 cial means toward salvation, a conversionist ideology influencing school ing, the book trades, and missionary work in the New England colonies. The ordinary road for Anglicans followed a different ideology, one that emphasized "training in obedience, deference, and a cheerful acceptance of one's lot in life . . . and in furthering the aims of British imperialism" (16). Monaghan draws evidence from the eighteenth century for this focus, examining the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel's work across the colonies and among the Mohawks in northern New York. Part 2 serves as a transitional section, measuring an increase in books circulating while surveying scenes of instruction between 1730 and 1750 in Boston, Georgia, Virginia, and rural Pennsylvania. Benjamin Franklin's self-education, George Whitefield's Bethesda school, Devereux Jarratt's re sourcefulness, and Christopher Dock's German-language pedagogy exem plify modes of schooling and literacy acquisition in this transitional phase, when the ordinary road was widening to include secular titles but when materials were often still scarce. Importantly, however, this period began to see the introduction of the spelling book, a genre inserted into the ordi nary road's sequence "after the primer and before the Psalter" (195) that would dominate reading instruction in the decades after. Organized under the rubric "New Paths to Literacy Acquisition, 1750 1776," part 3 investigates concomitant expansions in book production and institutional schooling. It gauges changes in literacy in light of "social replication" (235), that phase where a consumer culture enabling colonial emulation of British elites had its corollary in textual access to seculariz ing genres and instruction. Writing practices reflected the "wider world of commerce and culture" (273) and an overview of children's books con cludes with John Newbery titles intended to entertain. Reading, for the young, is offered as "an amusing and economically vital exercise rather than a gateway to salvation" (332). Monaghan concludes with lively case studies from the 1770s: three sketches of instructors and pupils, where both sets of voices are heard, one scene presenting Anna Green Winslow in Bos ton and the other two orbiting Philip Vickers Fithian and John Harrower in Virginia. While the through-line of Monaghan's argument can feel predictable, it is the head-turning details that vivify the research and enrich the larger project of readership history. These are revelations of both prescript and practice. The surveys of prescriptive literature note the oscillating extremes</page><page sequence="13">Review Essay: History of the Book of literacy discipline. For instance, a rhyme from a spelling book insinu ated a punitive treasure hunt, where a birch tree branch in the woods was to be found to whip a resistant pupil. On the other hand, John Locke could recommend students be tricked into literacy, with letterforms to be printed on the sides of dice, making education a pleasurable game. As to reading practice, there are tantalizing moments as well: a young white boy's avid interest in Phyllis Wheatley and the publicity that surrounded her, culmi nating in a sudden exclamation "Good God! I wish I was in Heaven!"; an aunt who imitated the voice and prose style of her niece by writing in the margins of the youngster's diary; an enslaved African in 1710 South Caro lina who read the Book of Revelation against the grain. Monaghan leaves these stories and others for readers to unpack, but in them we see how a dogged method wed to an original topic creates winning results. Are we being materialist yet? Recall that for Benjamin the matter of the past is its fragments and bricks, its ruins and wreckage, clutter in the plots of history-writing, crystallized traces of neglected meaning. The tracking of obscure crystals from the past, which, through their recovery and decoding, unsettle the assumptions of historical narrative ?we might call this the Benjaminian impulse and we see it at work in at least two ways in Loughran and Monaghan. For The Republic in Print, the best evi dence operates in this shattering fashion, with hybrid lithographs, bungled frontispieces, and ruined statues serving a larger purpose: to demystify certain fixed nationalist stories that, as Loughran sees it, we tell ourselves and to foreground a processual study of nation building. Benjamin's legacy in Learning to Read and Write in Colonial America is less direct. The sedi mented traces that Monaghan recovers appear in her brief stories, which summon the methods of microhistory, a genre in the spirit of Benjamin's vision. Though only at the scale of the example (rather than the full-fledged microhistory of an event, place, or person), such stories are Benjaminian in their embedded meanings, their deviation from master narratives, and their interest in the underrepresented. And they occasionally arrest the de velopmental through-line of the monograph's thesis. For instance, there is an accretive quality to the evidence of religious reading protocols across the study's time span ?Monaghan is well aware of this ?that qualifies the larger secularizing trajectory of Learning to Read and Write in Colonial America's argument.</page><page sequence="14">6yo] EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 44, NUMBER 3 The Benjaminian impulse is hardly novel in contemporary historical practice, yet what is underappreciated in Benjamins thought is its concern for the irreducible and the interpretive and, for our purposes, how that concern might overlap with book history. Here too the matter of the works under review can guide us. The thick particularity of effective examples ? in Monaghan, a density of verbal story, artfully rendered; in Loughran, when present, a density of physical texture ?bespeak a historical materi alism in keeping with Benjamin's method. Such moments are a caution to book historians who see their task as exclusively descriptive or quantitative. But a historical materialism alert to the singular and the exegetical is also a caution to cultural studies scholars who would read another famous slogan from "Theses on the Philosophy of History" too simplistically: "there is no document of civilization that is not at the same time a document of barba rism" ("Theses" 256). On the face of it, this seems like an indictment of spe cial collections and rare books rooms, in keeping with Benjamin's swerve to the obscure and neglected. Notice, though, the categorical emphasis on particularity, the resistance (in this translation) to a plural and attenuating sense of "records," "papers," or "books," indeed the pressure placed on the irreducible "document." Notice also that a document that simultaneously expresses civilization and barbarity is a field of contradiction. It is multi valent. It requires interpretation. To be sure, Benjamin sought in the fol lowing sentences in "Theses" to disassociate himself from such documents; and I wholeheartedly encourage the cultivation of alternative collections of materialist history, separate from the traditional archive. But much like the claim placed on the reader by Benjamin's prose style, the statement is, if anything, an injunction to interpret, to take seriously individual items in institutional repositories.5 How might we theorize the irreducible and the interpretable in this portrait of a historical materialism at home in such institutions but atten tive to the neglected clutter of the past? The thick particularity of effective examples ?the fetching matter of book studies practice ?is especially a function of trawling the archive, those homes of eccentric wreckage de signed to surprise. Special collections, rare books rooms, historical soci eties, the various national libraries: the archive writ large in all its institu tional fuddy-duddiness is full of variant documents that deviate from the norms of social science and that inspire modes of thick description.

With different agendas, both G. Thomas Tanselle and Jerome McGann have argued for the "extreme concrete par ticularity"?the phrase is McGann's ? of every public and private cultural record (in Tanselle's concern for preservation) and of every copy of every edition of any literary work (in McGann's concern for the synchronic and diachronic meanings of art writing). The particularity of items in the ar chive complicates deductive generalization, amassing induction, quantita tive number crunching, and from-to historical narratives. Such items call equally for qualitative interpretation, the making of meaning. Qualitative interpretation is a province of humanities research most strongly associated with literary criticism. Yet it is a province about which literary studies seems to feel some shame when it goes out in the world of other disciplines. Jointly published in 2008 issues of Early American Lit erature and The William and Mary Quarterly, Eric Slauter's excellent essay on the trade gap between historians and literature specialists indexes this reticence by studiously avoiding the label "literary critic" to describe those housed in English departments, preferring "literary historian" and "liter ary scholar." In the responses that follow Slauter's contribution, the histori ans are unwilling to label literature specialists "literary historians" and only Elizabeth Maddock Dillon valuably advocates for the interpretive nuance of literary criticism. Literary studies has been especially avid in its interest in book history, perhaps because it lets literature professors don the robe of the scholar rather than the khakis or pantsuit of the critic. This shame over the role of criticism ?again, understood technically as the making of meaning?ill serves both book history and literary studies. A sensitivity to the particular, a facility at meaning making, a Benjaminian interest in de viations: such are the traits of a book history adept at reading the physique of texts while listening to the stories such texts generate.6 This, at least, is one way to construe the strengths of an interdisciplinary history of the book. Yet methodologically we need not, of course, tie our selves down, to Benjamin or to others. In fact, a third way occurs: con sider the serious play of a cat, batting at the past with the mix of fierce intensity, lingering meditation, and distracted hustle that balls of yarn or string toys inspire. The cat's bat turns to a welter of critical thought where the play's the thing: from Clifford Geertz's theorization of deep play to the early Stephen Greenblatt on improvisation and personhood to Stanley Cavell's genre study of 1930s romantic comedy to Peter Stallybrass's sly</page><page sequence="16">EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 44, NUMBER 3 provocation "Against Thinking." Within cultural studies, Alice Jardine, Ross Chambers, and Meaghan Morris have all carved out a space ?in witty, trenchant prose ?to understand the critical playfulness of femi nism, fiction, and consumerism, respectively. Among book historians, the scholarship of Randall McLeod ?or is it Random Cloud? or Claudia Nim bus? or Orlando R Booke? or Random Clod? ?comes to mind, with its (relentless) bibliographical focus and rhetorical fancy. So too, the nimble and profound microhistory of Carlo Ginzburg s The Cheese and the Worms remains a classic of readership studies. But that is not all. Oh, no. That is not all. Closer to our home in early American book history, there is the acerbic and mordant glee of Hugh Amory and James N. Green, librarians whose writings might be called book trades criticism, keen as each is on both quantitative and qualitative analysis. And one might recall here as well David Shields s interest in pleasure and Patricia Crain s emphasis on imagination in the reading lives of their historical subjects. None of these thinkers downplay the politics of history or its economic realities, but all open themselves to the unpredictability of the past and the surprises it may hold. Whatever the methodological muse, I mainly urge time spent with our cultural deposits and the institutions that house them, with the documents themselves and the immensely knowledgeable curators who handle them, such that we are doing not only a media ecology but a media archaeology. Whether we paw, leap, or bat, we need to make contact with artifacts in the archive, hunting them down in all their physicality, sniffing them out for their singularity, retrieving them in response to the call of their interpret ability. Are we being materialist yet? One answer, among many, though I trust you'll have a suitably feline reaction: Fetch! NOTES l. In English, "Theses" exists mainly in two editions. The first, which predominated in English literary studies from 1968 to 2003, is the version translated by Harry Zohn and found in the 1968 essay collection Illuminations. The second ?entitled "On the Concept of History," published in 2003, and also credited to Zohn ?appears in the fourth volume of the Selected Writings project overseen by the Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. For the main text, all quotations are from the 2003 version, due to its felicitous phrasing and its contextually rich home in the Bel knap Press edition. But for the main text, I retain the title "Theses on the Philoso</page><page sequence="17">Review Essay: History of the Book { 673 phy of History": it was Benjamin's informal name for a piece he never intended for publication and it refers to the version that has functioned as a touchstone for two generations of English-based literary scholars. As a title, "Theses" captures the axiomatic way in which Benjamin's essay has been parsed and deployed, thus rep resenting its reception as a poetic manifesto within English departments over the last forty years. In this vein, at one point in the main text I will quote a key variant from the 1968 version. This afterlife is part of a transmission history with origins equally pertinent to book studies practice. According to the Belknap editors, what Benjamin lugged through the Pyrenees, what he insisted on carrying in a "heavy black attache case" in ill health, was "in all likelihood ... the final text of'On the Concept of History'" (Selected 444). Elsewhere Benjamin gainsaid the publishing of the theses, for fear that they would be open to "enthusiastic misunderstanding" (of which I'm surely guilty, though surely not alone). Yet Benjamin called his Pyrenees bundle a '"new manuscript' that was 'more important than I am'" (Selected 441, 444). Part of the Benjamin myth, the poignancy of this textual history?the author's ambivalent intentions, the endurance of the piece and not the person, the posthumous, en thusiastic reception ?is nevertheless excruciating. Two typescripts survived and, through the shepherding of Theodor Adorno and Hannah Arendt, "Theses on the Philosophy of History" was published. 2. For example, the implications of Dror Wahrman's The Making of the Modern Self for eighteenth-century studies suggest that independence allowed colonials a new flexibility of self relative to English counterparts, and one not necessarily place or body-based. Alternately, Dana Nelson's National Manhood is oriented to the bodily, surveying notions of race, gender, and identity with a similar historical sweep and frame of reference as The Republic in Print, yet receives no mention. 3. On ratification, for example, Loughran puts it this way: "the Constitution's present-day hegemony depends just as much on our contemporary willingness to repress the memory of that dispersal," that is, on the benighted "inability of later generations" ?us simpletons ?to comprehend ratification's "splintered scene of founding" (289). Given that Federalists, Anti-Federalists, and eventually Re publicans argued early on about who best carried forward the "spirit of 76"; that three sectional and autonomous republics were for most, between 1783 and 1787, a seeming inevitability; that Jeffersonian democracy articulated states rights poli cies countermanding philosophically the Federalists and installing a discourse of enduring rhetorical power, relative to the Anti-Federalists; that embargo policy ignited sectional tensions; that the Nullification Crisis happened ?given a whole series of phenomena up through, one might speculate, the inordinate influence of an Iowa or Florida on the voting process or the melodrama of red state/blue state every election cycle, it can be argued that the United States is understood in the popular mind not as a hegemony of Federalist balance but as a regularly rehearsed scene of splintering. 4. Part of their vexed status is the paradox of the ATS and ABS: that they were, as</page><page sequence="18">674} EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 44, NUMBER 3 David Paul Nord and Leon Jackson have noted, capitalistically organized struc tures deliberately working beyond the market, given the gift economy motives of their operations. 5. Readers may note a change in source here, which echoes the larger point about irreducibility and variance. I quote from the English translation published in 1968 under the title "Theses on the Philosophy of History." The 2003 translation softens the sentiment by replacing "civilization" with "culture." Yet it is exactly the force of the 1968 apothegm that became a kind of doxa, aided by the axiomatic title "Theses," for literary scholars. Time will tell how the magisterial, multivolume effort by the Belknap Press to publish the writings will give us a new Benjamin; in citing the old Benjamin, I intend to witness a variant edition and gesture to its cultural impact. 6. For a remarkable study illustrating both qualitative and quantitative rigor, see Slauter's "Reading and Radicalization: Print, Politics, and the American Revolu tion," which analyzes the coming of the republic in print, in a mode I describe later in the main text as book trades criticism.
