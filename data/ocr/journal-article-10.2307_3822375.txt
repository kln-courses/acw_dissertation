<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAISM AND KINGSHIP: A LATE ROYAL STATUE AND ITS EARLY DYNASTIC MODEL* By JOHN BAINES and CHRISTINA RIGGS Publication of British Museum EA 941, a Late Period or early Ptolemaic royal statue in travertine whose model is the Early Dynastic statue of Djoser (Cairo JE 49158) from the serdab on the north side of his Step Pyramid, or another statue of the same type. We present the British Museum statue, compare it with the Djoser statue, and argue for the former's likely dating and Saqqara provenance. Both statues are significant for their iconography of divine kingship and mortuary transfiguration. THE touring exhibition Cleopatra of Egypt: From History to Myth,' organized by the British Museum, has returned a very unusual travertine statue fragment of a king (pls. XIII, 1-2 and XIV, 1-3; British Museum EA 941) to public display twenty years after it was relegated to storage in part because of doubts about its authenticity.2 The statue's authenticity is supported both by its early acquisition, since it was donated to the Museum by Queen Victoria in 1854 after she had received it as a gift from the British consul in Egypt, and by the rarity of its iconography and material. The king represented on the British Museum statue adopts the pose and combination of nemes and tripartite head-dresses which are otherwise unique to the surviving limestone serdab statue of Djoser from the Step Pyramid at Saqqara (compare pls. XIII, 1-2 with XIII, 3-4 and XIV, 3 with XIV, 4; discussed be- low). Now that this statue fragment's standing has been re-established,3 its archaizing iconography can be profitably explored. The link between the statue and its plausible model, the Djoser statue, helps to suggest a date range and hypothetical provenance, as well as raising questions about motivations of Late Period archaism and the meaning of the Djoser statue itself. British Museum EA 941 Although the catalogue entry in the Cleopatra exhibition catalogue describes EA 941 as a 'bust', it is the upper portion of a roughly life-size statue, preserved to chest level.

XIV, 1). At the back (pl. XIV, 3), this break merges with the bottom of the whole piece, while the bottom line at the front belongs to a second fracture.4 The head of the uraeus, some of the chin, the front of the false beard, and the left edge of the nemes have sustained some dam- age. The preserved part of the statue is otherwise in very good condition, although the surface is dull in colour and appears dirty.5 Because of the position of the breaks, there is no means of establishing from the piece itself whether it was a seated or a standing statue. However, both the Djoser statue and other cloaked royal statues, excepting those that are integrated structurally into architecture, adopt a seated pose.6 Although EA 941 could have had a standing form, with the feet together and enveloped by the cloak, a seated pose seems more likely, and more in keeping with the angled position of the statue's right arm. The present mounting places the back of the statue in a vertical line, but the torso may originally have leaned slightly backwards in relation to its lower body and postulated throne, as the Djoser statue does more markedly. The British Museum statue has an uninscribed back pillar, the top of which is approximately level with the armpit (pl. XIV, 3). The presence of a back pillar does not argue for or against a seated pose for the statue. Further, the lack of inscription on the back pillar does not imply that the area is unfinished. The entire surface is uniformly smoothed to the same degree; while an inscription could have been planned for incision into the finished surface, we see no special reason to posit incompletion here. Other statues of the late dynastic and Ptolemaic periods have uninscribed back pillars but an otherwise finished appearance,7 and if EA 941 exactly paralleled the Djoser statue in this respect, any inscription would have been confined to the front of the plinth. Only one other piece of Late Period or Ptolemaic royal statuary known to us is carved from travertine,8 and that is a statuette of the Twenty-Fifth Dynasty that is not comparable 4 The current bottom of the statue is made up from modem fill to create a horizontal surface for the mount. Josephson, Egyptian Royal Sculpture of the Late Period, pl. 1 la, reproduces the statue with the restored arm and lappets in place but without the present mounting. Recent surface cleaning has also removed the inventory number '941' formerly painted below the right wrist. 5 The degree of dirt or patination is evident in the contrast with the colour of the newly exposed break, which is striking even if the effect of polishing the finished surfaces may have been to darken them slightly. The surface was lightly cleaned for the recent exhibition and a fine polish was applied; there may also have been ancient polish. Ashton, Ptolemaic Royal Sculpture from Egypt, 84, states that the surface of the right arm is unfinished, but its present condition is more likely to derive from decay of the stone while in the ground, since it is close to the break, which was probably caused by decay. 6 Compare, for example, the statues of Khasekhem in the Ashmolean Museum (E. 517) and Cairo Museum (JE 32161): J.

The sculptor could conceivably have reused a large existing block or statue. Aston, Harrell, and Shaw'? record only one source for travertine that may have been exploited in the Late Period, a quarry in Wadi Umm Argub in Middle Egypt, but it is very difficult to assign workings to precise periods and other sources are no doubt possible. The method of carving and polishing the statue cannot now be easily assessed because the ancient surface is probably much altered by exposure to the air, but the sculptors may have exploited the stone's colour and graining, as was done with hard, dark stones in the Late and Ptolemaic periods. The final effect would have depended on whether the statue was painted; it is possible that paint was used to pick out salient details only, rather than to colour the whole."l The statue fragment represents a king wearing an enveloping cloak; a very long, squared- off false beard; and a tripartite wig partly covered by a nemes head-dress. The nemes leaves a narrow area of the forehead revealed, and the top of the head is moderately bulky, with its sides defined by the flare of the nemes sides. The uraeus, which sits half way up the front band of the nemes, has tightly coiled, symmetrical single loops; its body extends back in a straight line, bisecting the top of the head. The front band of the nemes is separated from the forehead by a curve that could be mistaken for a channel; the band bears no surface detail and ends in wide tabs at the mid-point of the ears. The side panels and lappets of the nemes are relatively narrow, as is its rear tail, or 'queue'. The tail merges into the top of the back pillar, without any line between them.'2 The nemes sits lightly over a tripartite wig that is as long as the nemes at the back and slightly longer than it at the front. Something of the wig's bulk is conveyed by how it projects beyond the body by about three centimetres, below which the small of the back forms an elegant concave curve. The nemes is also raised about three centimetres above the shoulders, whereas on other statues it almost always sits di- rectly on the shoulders. The wig's bulk is further evident in the inner lines of the front lappets, which slope down toward each other, creating a slightly flaring shape. The straight, squared-off false beard is longer than is generally found on royal statuary; it ends slightly above the ends of the nemes and about three centimetres above the bottom edge of the wig lappets. The horizontal waves of the beard are largely lost, but enough of them remains for certain identification. When the beard is viewed in profile (see pl. XIII, 2), a definite angle on either side demarcates it from the negative space behind. A statue of the same general period from Tanis in the Orabi Museum in Zagazig offers a parallel for the length of the beard and the way it is set off from the negative space behind. Beards are very 9 P. Pamminger, 'Features of the Past: A Royal Statuary and Its Secret', RdE 51 (2000), 153-73, esp. 161, publishing a piece in a private collection. Ashton, Ptolemaic Royal Sculpture from Egypt, 20, notes the stone's rarity in the Late Period but does not comment further. A referee kindly points to a travertine statue of the seventh century Chief Lector Priest Petamenope from the Kamak Cachette (Cairo CG 48620: J. A. Josephson and Mamdouh Mohamed Eldamaty, Statues of the XXVth and XXVIth Dynasties (CG; Cairo, 1999), 44-8 with pl. 20; F. Tiradritti, The Treasures of the Egyptian Museum (Cairo, 1999), 364). This is noteworthy for the association of travertine with archaism, since the Petamenope statue is clearly inspired by Old Kingdom styles of seated nonroyal statuary, although such pieces were not normally made of travertine. 10 In Nicholson and Shaw (eds), Ancient Egyptian Materials and Technology, 14. l1 See e.g. P. Reutersward, Studien zur Polychromie derPlastik, I: Agypten (Stockholm, 1958), whose research focused on partial painting. 12 Contrast the early Ptolemaic (?) royal statue British Museum EA 1641 (see n. 7), which has an altogether more three- dimensional, tubular nemes tail with a concertina-like surface modelling. 2001 105</page><page sequence="4">JOHN BAINES and CHRISTINA RIGGS rare in first millennium royal statuary, so that both the beard's presence and its length are probably archaizing elements.'3 The king wears a garment whose presence is indicated by a slight ridge at the neckline and by the sleeve, or textile edge, from which his clenched right hand emerges and which is only articulated over the wrist area, merging within a few millimetres into a completely smooth surface above and below. The right arm is held at a strongly rising angle and the fist is empty. There is a boss of stone beneath the otherwise well carved and finished thumb, forming a small 'buttress' that tapers into the fist. The boss is separated from the thumb itself by a carved line, which demonstrates that the detail is not unfinished but rather is a very unusual instance of negative space. The slender left arm is scarcely separated from the body below the armpit, and no other detail of flesh is discernible on the preserved torso areas. These features show that the statue wears an enveloping cloak over an undifferenti- ated body. The face is broad at the top and rounded, rather than shaped to give it an individual character. The eyes, which have marked inner canthi and a light, tapering cosmetic line, are set close to the nose and tilt slightly up toward the outside, nearing the eyebrows, which sweep down at the end. The right eye is very slightly higher and further from the nose than the left. The pupils are not carved; perhaps they were delineated in paint. The flat, almost straight centre of the brow, with a distinct outer curve, is typical of much Late Period and Ptolemaic statuary and offers no specific dating criterion. Similarly, the deep areas beneath the eyes and the salient cheeks-most clearly visible in profile-are common to works from several centuries. The nose is straight and quite large with a rounded tip; the nostrils are tiny, circular, flat-bottomed depressions. The mouth is relatively small, with flaring lips slightly upturned in a smile, and the naso-labial furrow is scarcely marked. Ashton and Josephson characterize the mouth corners as having 'drill holes', but no drilling marks are evident; rather, the corners are set within thumbprint-sized, curved depressions. The dam- aged chin was quite prominent, emerging from a rounded, fleshy jawline. The neck appears broad and thick and is relatively short. It curves forward toward the negative space behind the beard, so that the planes that circumscribe it act as a sculptural transition as well as modelling a body part. The ears are positioned rather high and have neatly carved struts, or negative space, between them and the nemes behind. Ashton interprets this feature, which parallels the treatment of the thumb, as showing that the statue is unfinished,'4 but nothing else in its workmanship or appearance supports this and we suggest another explanation below. 15 It is notoriously difficult to identify representations of specific rulers in Late Period and Ptolemaic royal statues, in part because there was much use of earlier models: fourth cen- tury kings continued the styles of Saite kings, while early Ptolemies emulated the art of the 13 No. 141 1; see K. Mysliwiec, 'A Lower Egyptian Sculptor's "School" of the Late Dynastic - Early Ptolemaic Period', in H. I. H. Takahito Mikasa (ed.), Cult and Ritual in the Ancient Near East (Bulletin of the Middle Eastern Culture Center in Japan 6; Wiesbaden, 1992), 61-90. The two pieces differ otherwise in a number of ways. For the rarity of beards on later statuary, see ibid. 72-3. Comparably long beards with nemes occur on clearly mortuary statues, such as the group of Senwosret I from his mortuary temple at Lisht: e.g. Lange and Hirmer, Egypt, pls. 86-7. 14 In Walker and Higgs, Cleopatra of Egypt, 42. 15 A JEA referee remarks that this treatment is common in Late statuary. Few royal pieces are published in photographs that make it possible to check the point. Among easily accessible material, a sphinx of Nectanebo I with a nemes in the approach to the Luxor Temple (no doubt among many of this group) shows a very similar detail: J. A. Josephson, Egyptian Royal Sculpture of the Late Period 400-246 B.C. (SDAIK 30; Mainz, 1997), pl. 3a. 106 JEA 87</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAISM AND KINGSHIP last Egyptian kings in order to suggest continuity with indigenous rulership.'6 Scholars tend to assume that any particular statue should be identified by facial type with a single king, yet this was not necessarily the main priority of the patron or the sculptor, whose prime concern may have been to create a work that was in keeping with a facial, bodily, and/or iconographic ideal. British Museum EA 941 has been attributed by Josephson to Nectanebo II and by Ashton to Ptolemy II Philadelphus. One of Ashton's key parallels is the colossal granite statue of Ptolemy II in the Vatican,"7 but the overall appearance of this work is very different. The other comparative pieces that Ashton cites are sphinxes, yet the attribution of sphinxes of many periods is often especially problematic, since they can have a rather stereotyped character concerned more with creating an architectural 'scene' than with presenting a particular ruler's individuality. The nemes tail and back pillar area of the British Museum statue also highlight some of the difficulties surrounding attribution and identification. Both this sector and the general leanness of bodily form are quite similar to a Ptolemaic royal statue in the Yale University Art Gallery,'8 but nothing else about the two statues is similar, and such features are gener- ally not reliable dating indicators. Josephson's dating comparanda for EA 941 are more satisfactory than those of Ashton, but many of his points could apply as well to Nectanebo I as to Nectanebo II. For example, the numerous sphinxes inscribed for Nectanebo I in the alley leading toward the Luxor Temple19 share a facial type whose generic appearance is close to that of British Museum EA 941. Like the Vatican sphinxes that Ashton assigns to Ptolemy II, though, the Luxor Temple sphinxes have an idealizing rather than individualiz- ing character. Only their inscriptions -which were probably present on almost all completed works-supplied the necessary identification. Given that only the torso of EA 941 is preserved, it is impossible to say whether the complete statue was once identified as a specific king by means of an inscription on its plinth, as on the Djoser statue, or by some other feature of its unknown original setting. Comparative art-historical analyses like those of Ashton and Josephson are valuable but not conclusive on the question of which king the statue might represent. We opt not to assign the statue specifically, but our interpretation of its provenance, iconography, and use, pre- sented below, may favour a fourth century date. The serdab statue of Djoser as a model type for British Museum EA 941 The iconographic elements of the British Museum statue can be summarized as consisting of: uraeus; divine wig; nemes over wig; very long straight beard; hand raised and resting at an acute angle on the chest with empty clenched fist; and undifferentiated cloak with no further bodily detail or decoration on the surfaces preserved. Apart from the uraeus, which is not standard on third millennium royal statuary in the way in which it later was, and one feature of the cloak (discussed below), this enumeration applies equally well to the statue of Djoser from the sealed chamber or serdab in the court next to the mortuary temple on the 16 See A. Leahy, 'Saite Royal Sculpture: A Review', GM 80 (1984), 59-76, for a valuable treatment for the first half of the Late Period. 17 Ptolemaic Royal Sculpture from Egypt, 94 [no. 6], with references; thought to be originally from Heliopolis. 18 See n. 7; dated by Bothmer to 220-180 BC. 19 See M.

XIII, 3-4; XIV, 4; XV, 1).20 The nemes over the wig is unique to this statue, while the rising angle of the fist disappeared from royal statuary no later than the reign of Khufu.21 The serdab, with the statue of Djoser inside, lacked its roof when it was excavated in the 1920s, but the excavators identified limestone roof blocks painted red on the underside to resemble wood.22 The front wall of the serdab had two circular holes drilled into it from the inside of the chamber, and in front was a small area with no trace of a stone roof, defined by two screen walls carved to represent open doors.23 Although the serdab was not bonded to the side of the pyramid, a 26 cm cut in the pyramid casing stones was apparently designed to receive the king's statue.24 The serdab had been entered by whoever removed the stat- ue's inlaid eyes, perhaps in the Old Kingdom or First Intermediate Period.25 No further information on the find circumstances is published, nor does the excavation report offer a precise dating of post-Early Dynastic modifications to the site. The area around the neighbouring mortuary temple yielded a number of fragments of other statuary in 'alabaster' and limestone, and the lower portion of an enthroned statue, very similar in type to the serdab statue, was recovered from the limestone chips heaped against the east face of the pyramid.26 The presence of this statue fragment led the excava- tors to hypothesize that a second, destroyed serdab once stood against the pyramid's east face, but no other evidence supports this. It is not clear where any of the statues from which these fragments derive had originally been set up. The court in front of the serdab was a fairly large open space to which statuary from the relatively cramped mortuary temple, against the pyramid's north face, could have been moved for breaking up, but there is no indication of where in the temple the pieces might have stood. Since so many features of the Djoser serdab statue and British Museum EA 941 coincide, and since no later parallel for the iconography of the Djoser statue is known, the resem- blance between the two can hardly be coincidental. The later piece must depend on the earlier, or else on a similar model of roughly the same date, and the most parsimonious 20 Cairo JE 49158; height 142 cm. PM III2, 414; C. M.

Photographs of the statue have been widely reproduced, e.g. Lange and Hirmer, Egypt, pls. 16-17. 21 The arm rises more sharply on British Museum EA 941 than on the Djoser statue, evidently because of the vast size of the latter's beard, which overlapped the forearm. For instances of arm poses on Old Kingdom statuary see, for example, material collected in W. S. Smith, A History of Egyptian Sculpture and Painting in the Old Kingdom2, (London, 1949); J. Vandier, Manuel d'archeologie egyptienne, III: Les grandes epoques, la statuaire (Paris, 1958); Egyptian Art in the Age of the Pyramids, exhibition catalogue, The Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, 1999). 22 Firth and Quibell, The Step Pyramid, 9. 23 Ibid. 51. 24 Ibid. 50. 25 M. Lehner, The Complete Pyramids (London, 1997), 155, notes reused blocks from the Step Pyramid complex in the late Fifth Dynasty Wenis Causeway, which suggests that, despite the remarkable respect generally shown to Djoser's monument, this did not extend to its stonework. Firth, ASAE 25, 152 with n. 1, noted similarly that the stonework was not spared and that the evidence of copper tools left behind over the site favoured relatively early periods for the destruction; see also Firth and Quibell, The Step Pyramid, 88.

Fragment no. 2 on pl. 95 is the Djoser-like piece. No findspot is indicated for the other fragments, but the excavators suggested that fragment no. 2 and a torso fragment with clenched right fist (no. 1) might have come from the same statue. All the fragments were of limestone except no. 15, a plaited beard fragment described as 'porphyry'. 108 JEA 87</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAISM AND KINGSHIP explanation is that EA 941 derives directly from the Djoser statue. While the archaeological evidence from the Step Pyramid is not decisive, it does permit such a possibility. The close connection between the two statues may favour Saqqara as the provenance of EA 941. The statue's arrival in Britain by 1854 is in accordance with this hypothesis, since Saqqara was heavily exploited in the first half of the nineteenth century. One obvious difference between the two statues is their material: Djoser is limestone, while the British Museum statue is travertine. Travertine was, however, a common stone for royal statuary in the Fourth Dynasty and later Old Kingdom, so that its use for EA 941 fits with an archaizing intent. In addition to valuing the travertine for its scarcity, the sculp- tor or patron of the Late statue may have associated this stone with works of the distant past. Despite the congruence in the iconography of the Djoser and British Museum statues, they are far apart in style, each being generally typical of its own time. The Late Period work does not attempt to copy the Early Dynastic one; rather, it reuses the same repertory of elements. It diverges from its model in three notable respects. First, EA 941 has a back pillar, whereas the Djoser statue has a gap between the massive wig and the high throne back beneath, with the two elements almost on the same alignment. Back pillars were vir- tually universal in the first millennium and this discrepancy is unlikely to have any special meaning. Similarly, after the Old Kingdom kings were almost never shown without a uraeus, so that the presence of the uraeus on EA 941-the second difference-may have been seen as mandatory for a royal image in the first millennium. Third, the Late statue lacks both the partly exposed shoulder blades and the ridge in the garment at the upper back of the Djoser statue. The former element, which occurs on some early statues and reliefs and is associ- ated with the sed-festival,27 may have been rare in the Late Period and thus was overlooked or altered.28 Furthermore, the Late statue seems to have reinterpreted the garment form as quasi-'mummiform', a much more common sort of 'attire' for the body-for example, of Osiris-in first millennium representation than in the third millennium. The body of the Djoser statue lends itself easily to such a mummiform reinterpretation, since it has no gar- ment details below the arms while its toes, though separately modelled, are not carved with sharp details and are painted white, so that they should be understood as being covered by the garment. We return below to the significance of this garment and the undifferentiated body form. Stylistically, the Djoser statue has heavy features with prominent mouth and lips and a generally rounded modelling of the head and body. This bulkiness, evident notably in the wig, has parallels in Third Dynasty nonroyal statuary.29 Because the inlaid eyes were gouged out-probably long before the Late statue was made-it is not easy to evaluate the treat- ment of the face, but the head shows clear affinities with representations of Djoser in relief, notably in the galleries under the Step Pyramid and South Tomb.30 There is a black mous- 27 Notably the Early Dynastic ivory statuette of a king in the British Museum, EA 37996: A.

Another feature of the Djoser statue that may be typical of earlier periods is the treatment of its ears. These are pressed forward and outward by the nemes and appear almost to be in strong relief rather than modelled in three dimensions (see pl. XIII, 3);32 their rather inexactly applied, possibly secondary colour (see below) sets them off from the nemes itself. This vivid treatment of the nemes and wig as 'crowding' a natural feature of the body contrasts strongly with the Late statue, while also placing some emphasis on the ears themselves. Traces of yellow paint on the face were reported by William Stevenson Smith.33 This would be a very unusual feature-one would normally expect red-that could have a range of symbolism, from the radiance later associated with the nemes, to age, as is known on a number of Old Kingdom statues representing distinctively aged men.34 On inspection of the original in the Cairo Museum, this detail is not clear, but yellow flesh colour is certainly preserved on the exposed left shoulder,35 so that the presence of yellow colour on the origi- nal is assured; the right shoulder has lost all colour. The face appears to have alternating bands of red and yellow paint that have merged into one anoterther, and may be the product of an original yellow overpainted with red; since yellow can discolour to red but not vice versa, some original presence of yellow is likely. This posited overpainting fits with the appearance of the moustache, of which the visibe black painted parts, which are on the statue's right side, seem to emerge under a thick layer of red overpainting. Other surviving details of colour are red on the right hand, black elements on the wig (there seems to be no colour preserved on the nemes), and black on the front of thent beard, leaving the areas behind as negative space. Unlike the rest of the statue's surface, the inscription on the front of the plinth has lost all trace of colour and appears to have little of the plaster underlayer; this loss could be due to repeated copying, either in antiquity or since its rediscovery in the 1920s, or conceivably to how it lay in the ground. Yellowish patination-not paint-on the shoulders, down the back of the statue, and on the throne at the back suggests that the back areas were open to the sky for long periods, either after the inlaid eyes were removed or in the Late Period, and hence were presumably accessible to view. Several of the surface details just described strongly suggest that the Djoser statue was repainted long after it was first carved and completed. The possible replacement of yellow on the face with red and the overpainting of the moustache might fit a Late Period date for such restoration, since at that time those features would have seemed unusual and perhaps anomalous. A final relevant detail here is the presence of small areas of plaster on the damaged right profile of the nemes. These could only have been deposited after the damage occurred, and so provide strong evidence for a secondary treatment of the statue at a later exhibition catalogue (Milan, 1998), 260-1 [nos. 39-41]. The late Third Dynasty relief of Horus Qahedjet in the Louvre retains a similar facial type: Egyptian Art in the Age of the Pyramids, 177-8 [no. 9]. On all these figures the body is quite lean and taut; it cannot be compared directly with the undifferentiated form of the serdab statue. 31 Firth and Quibell, The Step Pyramid, pls. 16, 42. 32 Still clearer in Lange and Hirmer, Egypt, pl. 17. 33 A History of Egyptian Sculpture2, 14, with no further comment. 34 H.

Strikingly, the eye sockets with their disfiguring damage caused by the removal of the inlays do not appear to have been restored in later times. The overall form of the seated king leans slightly backward, as is again paralleled from the same period.36 In view of the great importance of thrones in other contexts,37 it is likely that the throne type contributes to the meaning of this work. The form of the throne is similar to that on the statues of Khasekhem (see n. 6), with a back rising to a little below the occupant's shoulder blades, distinctive sides carved in relief next to the occupant's lower body, and forward-sloping legs with a curve at the angle from the seat of the throne. The throne back of Khasekhem's Cairo schist statue has a flat, rectangular compartment above seat level, while those of his Ashmolean limestone statue and the Djoser statue are simpli- fied into a single rectangle with a raised border that has the same overall shape.38 The thrones of all three statues lean back, although Khasekhem's body is vertical with if any- thing a slight forward tilt, notably on the Cairo statue. In contrast with the Djoser statue, what survives of the Late statue is very lean and, especially in profile, gives the impression of a flattened cylinder, regardless of its present mounting. Whereas the double-layered head-dress appears reasonably three-dimensional when viewed frontally, in profile (pls. XIII, 2; XIV, 1) the back of the wig is thin, while the nemes is little more than a skin over it. The back pillar, too, is relatively unsubstantial, even though the back of the wig sits within its profile. It is as if the iconographic elements are applied almost enumeratively, without the desire to give them a fully plastic form. The sculptor of the Late statue may also have been limited by the size of the available block of travertine. Thus, whereas the Djoser statue is fully realized in the round and can be mean- ingfully viewed from all angles-although such viewing was not possible where it was set up-the Late statue seems designed essentially to be seen from in front. Subjectively, its verticality and anonymous features are more like scene-setting than an evocation of a per- son. These aspects of its composition might reflect the original function or location of EA 941, or they might simply signal that the sculptor had mastered, or been commissioned to work in, a style of this sleek, idealizing character. Archaism at Saqqara in the Late and early Ptolemaic Periods The context of the Djoser statue by the Step Pyramid suggests that it could have been accessible for viewing in the Late Period. The excavators noted evidence of restoration in the pavement of the mortuary ritual area to which the serdab belonged;39 although they did not suggest a date for the restoration, the Late Period is very plausible. The pyramid com- plex had already been the object of antiquarian visits in the New Kingdom,40 but interest in the site became particularly intense from the Twenty-sixth Dynasty onward. Copy grids visible on two of the three reliefs of Djoser in the galleries under the Step Pyramid are 36 E.g. H.

One example of this is a bronze base for a statuette of Ptah, which was excavated in the Sacred Animal Necropolis at North Saqqara in 1968-9.45 On the back of the base is the Horus name Netjerikhet (pl. XV, 2, 3), and on the two sides are the Souls of Pe and Nekhen (pl. XV, 4, for right side). The base is thus a pastiche of Third Dynasty and later motifs combined in a novel way, since Horus names are not normal in such a context. The form of the name is not the same as on the Djoser statue under discussion here, and so probably demonstrates that other examples of Djoser's titulary were recovered from the Step Pyramid complex in the Late Period.46 There was a vast amount of building throughout Saqqara in the Late and early Ptolemaic Periods. To the southeast of the Step Pyramid enclosure, on the site of the later monastery of Apa Jeremias, a temple-like complex was built around a Late Period tomb, with statue or shrine chapels whose walls were carved in Old Kingdom style.47 The last three native dy- nasties saw extensive rebuilding at Saqqara: Nectanebo I probably reconstructed the Serapieion, since his cartouches appear in a pylon of its enclosure wall, and Nectanebo II is identified in the Apis temples and on some sphinxes along the Serapieion Way.48 At North Saqqara, where the Sacred Animal Necropolis attests to the importance of animal cults, fourth century rulers, including Nectanebo II, undertook the wholesale remodelling of the desert escarpment for the Anubieion and Bubastieion complexes and the numerous service annexes that these required.49 Part of the Anubieion complex included the area around the 41 Firth and Quibell, The Step Pyramid, pis. 15-16. For comparable evidence from Abusir, see J. Baines, 'The Destruc- tion of the Pyramid Temple of Sahure', GM 4 (1973), 9-14. The reuse of motifs from the Abusir reliefs in a monument of the reign of Amasis shows that those grids cannot be later than the mid-sixth century. 42 For both of these points, see Firth and Quibell, The Step Pyramid, 90-1, pls. 12, 22 h-z.

Zemina, Forgotten Pharaohs, Lost Pyramids: Abusir (Prague, 1994), 29. 43 See Malek and Magee, BSEG 9-10, 168-71; they also suggest that the two leonine embalming tables (Cairo CG 1321-2), found by Mariette in subterranean galleries in the northwest part of the enclosure, date to the Late Period and relate to embalming practices in the vicinity. 44 Wildung, Die Rolle dgyptischer Konige. The cult appears to have been located in the area of the Bubastieion, so perhaps not in the Step Pyramid complex itself. Since the priest Ahmose, the principal evidence for the cult, was also a priest of King A sr-jtt, presumably the successor of Djoser who would have been known from king lists but perhaps from little or nothing else, these priesthoods may have been cultural statements as much as cultic realities. 45 Unpublished; photographed on site in 1969-70; precise dimensions not available but 5-7.5 cm wide.

Emery, 'Preliminary Report on the Excavations at North Saqqara, 1966-7', JEA 53 (1967), pl. xxvi, 4. 46 The form is also different from that on the statue base with the names of Djoser and Imhotep (Firth and Quibell, The Step Pyramid, pl. 58), so that the source would probably have been different again. 47 J.

Finds from these areas range from the Twenty-sixth Dynasty to the end of the Ptolemaic Period and so do not offer any guide to a close dating of what may have been set up, and where. One hypothetical location for the British Museum statue would be somewhere in installations for the cult of the dei- fied Imhotep, which presumably existed at North Saqqara. The statue's connection with Djoser would have been fitting if, as seems likely, it was known at the time that Imhotep had lived in his reign.51 A connection with Imhotep might also have motivated the use of Djoser's Horus name on the bronze statuette base of Ptah (pl. XV, 2-3), since Imhotep as a god was said to be the son of Ptah. Within the Step Pyramid complex itself, EA 941 could have formed part of a restoration programme like that observed around the serdab; alternatively, the statue could be a more indirect product of the Djoser statue's accessibility during or in the wake of such work. If the Late statue was erected as part of a restoration programme, this implies that there was a more thoroughgoing revival than has otherwise been proposed. It is conceivable that the area around the serdab and mortuary temple was 'landscaped' with both recent and older statuary. Some of the numerous unfinished statues found in the complex might belong to this phase, rather than to the original monument, or might be older works that were re- erected to create an imposing setting, as some of them have been in the modern refurbishment.52 The mortuary context of the Djoser statue makes it tempting to consider that EA 941 also had a mortuary connection, but there is no obvious place for this at Saqqara- although one could imagine the existence of a chapel for a statue cult within a larger temple complex-while little is known about the burials and cults of Late Period kings. The physical appearance of EA 941 may be significant in considering how and where the piece was originally used. The statue appears to be unique in being a 'travesty' in which a three-dimensional royal representation was created with the iconography of a bygone age: its key features have no continuity with the immediate past, nor are they an innovation. At the same time, the statue does not copy an older style, unlike some nonroyal Late Period pieces that imitate Early Dynastic or Old Kingdom works.53 Instead, EA 941 uses a con- temporary style to revive the rare model typified by Djoser's serdab statue.

The pastiche-like quality of the statue's archaism is all the more striking since the very existence of EA 941 implies that the Djoser statue (or a near-identical statue of this type) was accessible. Close copying may have been avoided in order to distance the Late statue from its model, for reasons that cannot be known. In royal representations of any period, iconography seems to have been more easily transferable than style. The relationship between the model and the later piece should also be considered in the context of broader patterns in Late Period and subsequent artistic development. The British Museum statue highlights the difficulty in some artistic domains of distinguishing a Twenty- sixth Dynasty style from a fourth century one, or a Late Period style from an Egyptian-form Ptolemaic one, because in all these periods kings were shown in a range of facial types, from the individual to the generic. If EA 941 is, as we tentatively suggest, a work of the fourth century (perhaps the Twenty-ninth or Thirtieth Dynasty), it fits well with contempo- raneous relief material, in particular in its marriage of disparate iconography and style. The fourth century was a time of large-scale and innovative work on temples, like the unparal- leled granite construction at Behbeit el-Hagar,55 and reliefs on monuments like naoi show a great interest in the diversity of sculptural forms.56 Nonroyal reliefs of this time also evince a taste for new combinations of features while building on Twenty-sixth Dynasty trends.57 An increased 'mannerism'58 is evident in stylistic quirks that create visual patterns but do not contribute to the superficial meaning of a scene. Toward the end of the fourth century and into the Ptolemaic Period, less of such 'mannerism' is evident. Instead, artistic devel- opments continue Late styles organically rather than creating deliberately eclectic mixes, the tomb of Petosiris at Tuna el-Gebel being one possible exception and a special case.59 In their Egyptian portrait sculpture, the early Ptolemies likewise continued Late Period styles, and EA 941 may be Ptolemaic, as Ashton and others have suggested. The dissimilar treatment of iconography and style on the British Museum statue may seem, to modem observers, to create a mismatch between these dimensions of meaning. In this respect, the statue and other eclectic works can be compared with the adoption of Egyptian iconography in different stylistic and representational modes in the Egyptianizing works of Roman Imperial times.60 The visual and conceptual distance between the Egyp- 54 The tip of the thumb is lost from the Djoser statue, so no comparison is possible there. 55 C.

Underlying both instances, however, is the fact that the designers sepa- rated 'content' from 'style'. For the Djoser and the British Museum statues, the artistic style corresponds to the period in which each was produced; the shared content is a particular iconography of divine kingship. Significance of the statues' iconography Because rather little Late Period royal statuary is preserved, and its use is poorly docu- mented, the British Museum fragment cannot easily be compared with other works or their functions. In order to supply a context, we review symbolic aspects of the iconography, which are best considered in relation to their original use in the Early Dynastic Period. This section therefore focuses principally on the Djoser statue. As the focal element abutting the Step Pyramid in the large court next to the mortuary temple, the Djoser statue must have had an overriding importance in its original setting. The iconography, which is a hybrid of divine and royal, fits with its role. Its most distinctive features are the divine wig covered by the nemes, the unusual beard, and the treatment of the body, all contributing to a massing of attributes that is hardly attested again in statuary until the later Eighteenth Dynasty.61 Traces of yellow paint on the skin are also significant, and in sharp contrast with the red paint typically used for men. The fusion of iconographic elements in the Djoser statue gives it a depth of meaning that has no clear parallels except in British Museum EA 941, although the lost repertory of cult statues may have included forms that similarly condensed meanings by overlaying attributes. The placement of the nemes over the divine wig makes the nemes superficially salient but also draws attention to the divine wig by not covering it completely, in an interplay of forms that is scarcely exploited in the more schematic Late statue. Presumably, an actual nemes head covering was designed for use with other, less voluminous head-dresses. On the Djoser statue, the tripartite wig represents the king's divine status, which emerges, as it were, to overwhelm the royal status signified by the nemes. Although the nemes was com- mon on royal statuary from the time of Djoser onward, all the well provenanced Old Kingdom examples come from mortuary complexes and so cannot show whether the symbolism of the nemes related more to terrestrial kingship or, as is attested in the Coffin Texts, had primarily celestial meanings.62 There is, however, no reason to think that celestial associa- tions would be less significant for the living than for the deceased king. Moreover, the nemes was later widespread on statues of kings in non-mortuary contexts, so that a reading of its symbolism as relating to kingship in general is more plausible than one limiting it to the deceased king. In anthropomorphic statuary larger than a miniature size, the nemes was normally worn in conjunction with kilts and was seldom depicted with the cloak of the 61 We have in mind the proliferation of attributes, such as combinations of wig and crowns, on statuary and reliefs of Amenhotep III. See A. P. Kozloff and B. M. Bryan, Egypt's Dazzling Sun: Amenhotep III and His World, exhibition catalogue, the Cleveland Museum of Art (Cleveland, 1992), with references; examples in statuary (much of it small) are nos. 12, 13, 15, 20, 21. 62 K.

Nonetheless, we do not mean to deny that the nemes may have occurred on statuary in temple contexts, for example, but only to say that no definite examples have been found. 2001 115</page><page sequence="14">JOHN BAINES and CHRISTINA RIGGS Djoser statue. The divine wig, by contrast, is very rare in royal iconography and conveys a clear message of deification.63 The beard is perhaps the most striking attribute of the Djoser statue. It is damaged and its precise shape cannot be reconstructed, but it appears to have been longer than almost any example now known, divine or royal, and significantly longer than that of the Late statue;64 the broken projection down onto the arm (pl. XIII, 4) cannot have been only a prop or a piece of negative space. The horizontal waves of the surviving part are those of a royal beard, whereas a divine beard normally has indications of a plaited texture. The beard's enormous size suggests that it not only merged royal and divine qualities but also had a special, presumably divine, significance. A very remote parallel for associating divinity with a long beard might be the snake's beard in the Shipwrecked Sailor, which is said to be two cubits long (cols. 63-4), equivalent to one-fifteenth of the snake's stated body length. Another fusion of royal and divine elements is the Djoser statue's enveloping cloak with a shoulder ridge. This seems to combine two garments that would separately symbolize the revivification enacted in the sed-festival (the ridged cloak) and deification (the enveloping cloak). Elsewhere, the cloak with the ridge is worn shorter, to the knee or mid-calf, and is generally depicted on standing or moving figures.65 Other short cloaks worn by Early Dy- nastic or Old Kingdom rulers lack this ridge and can have more surface details, as on the two statues of Khasekhem, which depict the king enthroned above his defeated enemies.66 The length of Djoser's cloak and its uniform surface-interrupted only for the emergence of his hands and the articulation of the toes under the garment-points to its additional significance as a mark of the king's deification. Already in the Early Dynastic Period, this enveloping cloak form may have looked back, within a different treatment of the body, to the unarticulated and undifferentiated bodies of ancient deities.67 Undifferentiated body types like Djoser's have often been characterized as 'mummiform', but there is no reason to believe that the artificially created shape of a mummified body influenced their iconography. The opposite is more likely to be the case: the ideal shape of a mummy, exemplified by the hieroglyph determining an image or statue (twt), reflects the symbolism of the undifferentiated, divine body. To be mummified was to aspire to certain god-like qualities and status, and the undifferentiated body as mummy was eventually ex- ploited in nonroyal contexts, for coffins, shabtis, and depictions of funerary deities.68 Cloaked bodies in general could have had some association with divine, undifferentiated physiques, since the garment revealed only the contours of the body, whether worn by a ruler or, for example, by a Middle Kingdom official. For royal representations, the undifferentiated body appears chiefly on colossi integrated into architecture, as in the second court of the temple of Ramesses III at Medinet Habu, where it contrasts with a differentiated body in 63 Another example is the wooden ka-statue of Awibre Hor (PM 1112, 888-9). Apart from the nude genitals, originally covered with a penis sheath, this statue has essentially the same iconography as relief representations of the royal ka, which have a more strongly divine character than general royal iconography; see further L. Bell, 'Luxor Temple and the Cult of the Royal Ka', JNES 44 (1985), 251-94. 64 A comparable beard appears on the unfinished architectural statues from the Step Pyramid complex; see n. 52. 65 Good examples of standing figures include the unfinished engaged statues found in the Step Pyramid complex; see n. 52.

In the shrine of Sety I in the Osiris complex of his temple at Abydos, relief figures of the king are strongly divinized and wear a white garment that envelops the feet.69 In these later examples, both royal and nonroyal, the undifferentiated body seems to signify enhanced or divine status. The same symbolism is well suited to Djoser's serdab statue, whose function was to mediate between his deified spirit self and the cult presented to him in the mortuary temple. One aspect of this function, and indeed of any mortuary cult, was the receiving of offerings, and the seated posture of the statue reinforces this. Djoser's closed right fist is raised to his chest while the other hand lies flat on his thigh, a pose which is very similar to the pose of tomb owners represented on Early Dynastic and Old Kingdom offering table scenes.70 The overall significance of the iconography may be that the king's deified self meets his human self at a point of transformation and transition between this world and the next. The tripartite wig, the length of his beard, and the enveloping cloak mark his divinity, while the nemes, the shape of the beard, and the ridged edge of the cloak convey royal, human quali- ties. The nemes and his yellow flesh also suggest the king's solar radiance, and the latter perhaps age as well.71 In this form, Djoser was renewed perpetually through the enactment of the cult. The decoration of the shrine of Sety I in the Osiris complex at Abydos again offers a useful comparison here;72 like Djoser's serdab, it provided a secondary cult place for the deified king. In the shrine reliefs, different figures of Sety I are shown with the nemes, with a divine wig and beard, with an overlong royal beard, and with a long enveloping cloak over an undifferentiated body. These traits are not fused in the manner of the Djoser statue, since the plurality of figures conveys meaning as a group, but the iconographic strategy of the shrine is closely comparable to that of the statue, representing the posthumous deifica- tion of the king. In the Late Period, the meanings o the Djoser statue would have been more apparent than they are to modern viewers, and they would also have been interpreted more freely and creatively than can now be done. At the least, it is likely that the iconography of divinization in the Djoser statue provided part of the stimulus to create the Late statue, British Museum EA 941. As a royal figure immanently deified in conjunction with a mortuary cult, the statue of Djoser stood apart from the statuary of succeeding periods, and thus may have offered a powerful statement that was worth reviving in a new context. We suggest that the Djoser statue was rediscovered between the Twenty-sixth and Thirti- eth Dynasties and, either directly or through an identical type, served as the model for British Museum EA 941. The style of EA 941 suggests a date toward the end of that timespan, but a number of dates are possible, including an early Ptolemaic attribution. The statue's idealizing facial type may have more to do with the king's aspiration to divinity than with 69 A. M. Calverley and M. F.

This difference from statuary may be due to compositional constraints in two dimensions; for nonroyal statues also raising the right hand, see Sourouzian, in Grimal (ed.), Les criteres de datation, figs. 46a-b (Metjen), 48 (Rahotep). 71 For yellow colour and age, see n. 34. 72 Reference in n. 69. It is not possible to give an analysis of this shrine here. The royal cult area in the temple of Ramesses III at Medinet Habu has some comparable features; see The Epigraphic Survey, Medinet Habu, VI (OIP 84; Chicago, 1963), pls. 447-51. 117 2001</page><page sequence="16">JOHN BAINES and CHRISTINA RIGGS physical identification as a particular ruler. The iconographic affinity with the Djoser statue argues for the Late statue's having been erected at Saqqara, perhaps as part of a Late Period refurbishment of the Step Pyramid complex or within one of the animal cult installations. Why a deified royal image was created and set up is uncertain; while cults of kings from earlier periods were revived in the Late Period,73 the case for a local mortuary cult of recent ones is less clear.74 Yet although the Late statue's ultimate purpose remains open to ques- tion, its significance is without doubt, for it is a singular object which revives, in contemporary visual style, an archaic and portentous iconography of kingship. 73 E.
