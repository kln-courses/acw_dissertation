<plain_text><page sequence="1">Shahr-i Sokhta and Tepe Yahya: Tracks on the Earliest History of the Iranian Plateau by C.C. Lamberg-Karlovsky and Maurizio To si Prior to 1967 little was known of the prehistory of eastern Iran. That year, however, saw the beginning of two research programs which were to have a major impact on our understanding of not only eastern Iran but its relations to Mesopotamia, the Persian Gulf, Turkmenistan and finally, the Indus area. The archaeological excavations at Shahr-i Sokhta, in Iranian Sistan, and Tepe Yahya in the Kerman province of south-eastern Iran, have been sponsored respectively by IsMEO and the Peabody Museum of Harvard University in col? laborations with the Archaeological Service of Iran. We begin with a summary of results and problems generated from these two research designs followed by a discussion of discrete correlations between Shahr-i Sokhta, Yahya and related sites and conclude with a tentative model of urbanization processes in our respective areas. This paper does not pretend to be a comprehensive review of the substantive data for either the internal processes or external parallels which support chronological contempora? neity of Shahr-i Sokhta, Yahya and related sites. We have selected the most significant par? allels for comparison and contrast; not only between these two sites but the related mate? rials from sites as distant as Turkmenia, Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf. Such an ap? proach has allowed us to suggest a number of interaction spheres and their different pat? terns of cultural integration. The materials presented and their interpretations must be con? sidered as tentative. We believe, however, that our presentation, on the one hand expan? sive and general, on the other restricted and concise, provides a new perspective. Future research must concentrate on the elucidation of specific detail and a strengthening of the models and interpretations herein provided. (*) This paper results from a collaboration proposed over three years ago. From the 7th of April to the 16th of May, 1972 the authors pre? pared the manuscript at the Peabody Museum, Harvard University. Both authors have had the opportunity to intensively study the material re? mains from Shahr-i Sokhta and Tepe Yahya through complimentary visits to IsMEO and the Peabody Museum. Our collaboration benefited from the assistance of R. Biscione, P. Kohl, R. Meadow and M. Piperno, all of whom are participants in our respective research programs. We are most grateful to Prof. G. Tucci, President of the IsMEO and Prof. S. Williams, Director of the Peabody Museum, who have freely provided their support and encouragement in this endeavor. The authors would like to thank Martha Lamberg Karlovsky who assisted with editing and typing. 21</page><page sequence="2">Shahr-i Sokhta: Model of an Expansive Settlement The Hilmand River ends its course in a 50,000 sq.km. land-locked basin, bounded to the west by the narrow, barren chain of Kucha Mountains and east by the extensive, arid depression of the Registan Desert. The present geological configuration of the basin is al? most totally the result of recent Pleistocene deposits consisting of marls, sand, clay and gravel (1). These quaternarian lake and riverine deposits have been recorded to a depth of over 500 metres (2). The Hilmand flows into this basin with a large intricate network of canals terminating in the Hamun-i Hilmand, an extensive swampy lake, widely exposed to rapid evaporation. A large belt of swamp flora, once rich in small mammals and birds, sur? rounds the eastern edge of the lake. The size of the delta and the rich overflow of the river make possible the present day cultivation of over 45,000 hectares of land (3). These geographical features have resulted in this area being the major population centre of eastern Iran south of Mashhad. Fields and villages line the natural and artificial canals while the main settled, non-farming population is located in the district's capital, Zabol. Although reduced in the past two decades, herding still plays a major role in the economic life of Sis tan. The cattle herders are concentrated on the eastern side of the lake. They live in small villages with reed huts built in a settlement pattern advantageous to the care of the cattle. Sheep, goat and camel herders generally live in semi-permanent encamp? ments of extended families in eight to twelve tents, set along the immediate borders of the cultivated areas. The kinship relations between herders and farmers are numerous and significant, in accord with the kinship model based on intermarriage present in most of the semiarid steppe lands of the Near East (4). We can therefore set forth the following ecological features of Sistan as a valid frame? work for research on the urban anthropology of the area: 1) an extensive irrigated prairie with clayey soil suitable for land-use, with an average rainfall of 150-200 mm.; 2) a general tendency to concentrate services and administrative power in a single nuclear centre; 3) the close proximity of mountains to the west with zones of limited mineral exploi? tation; (x) Italconsult, Project 3: Sistan Agricultural Development Comprehensive Flood Control and Irrigation Plan, Annex 1: Geo-pedological Report, Rome, Feb. 1962, pp. 9-15.

These six features testify to the logical tendency of Sistan to an accumulation and concen? tration of surplus with a parallel increase in animal and human populations. The division of labour and the settlement patterns, in accordance with the four different socio-ecological sub? systems, are integrated by a continuous interchange of goods and services. Any archaeological investigation in Sistan, concerned with processes, structures and models of the earliest as well as recent urban growth could hardly avoid taking into con? sideration these major points of reference. The environment suggests a preliminary state? ment: enormous quantitative development of the economic production and density of human and animal populations could have been reached here in a relatively short time, especially if related to the growth of other less suitable regions of the Iranian Plateau, i.e. the Soghun Valley surrounding Tepe Yahya. The crisis and collapse of this system could have been as rapid as the growth, on the other hand, owing to the instability of its hydro Icgical supply. All the recorded prehistoric sites are located in southern Sistan, at latitude 30?30' N, in a region that today is completely dry and unsuitable for settlement and farming (map 5). Islamic and early historical sites cluster north of this latitude. This sharp distinction in set? tlement distribution is due to a radical change in the riverine system of the Hilmand whose delta flow is now directed toward the northern part of the country (5). The first archaeological researches in this area were started in 1960 by the Italian Ar? chaeological Mission to Iran (6). Previous to this the only recorded survey had been carried out for a limited period by Sir Aurel Stein in 1916 (7). Since 1967 there have been ex? cavation and related investigations at Shahr-i Sokhta, the largest Bronze-Age site in Sis? tan (8): a flat plateau covered by a thick layer of potsherds (fig. 2).

All the minor set? tlements, which never exceed two hectares, are clustered around the dried-up areas of the delta (map 5). This is a rather unusual settlement pattern as one notes the absence of any medium-sized town between the 70 hectares of the nuclear centre and the 2-hectare villages south of it. Parallels to this peculiar distribution can be made with the settlement patterns of late Indus-Civilization sites east of Lake Machhar in Pakistan and that of southern Turk menia during Period Namazga V where the rural population tended to concentrate in the great urban complexes of Altyn and Namazga Tepe, averaging 70 and 50 hectares (9). The four campaigns that have been conducted so far at Shahr-i Sokhta have uncovered un area of 4,850 sq.m., revealing a succession of large and medium-sized buildings, stra tigraphically characterized by a continuous sedimentation of artificial fillings sealed by floors and walls, all testifying to a conspicuous architectural activity together with an advanced material culture (fig. 3). On the evidence of major architectural variations and changes in the complex of finds, primarily the pottery, an historical sequence, divided into four major periods, has been proposed (10). The earliest horizon (Period I) lies directly above natural sedimentary soil. Very little architectural remains have as yet been uncovered, but the finds supply us with an interest? ing, although incomplete, body of information. The pottery found shows remarkable con? nections with the types of the Geoksjur Culture which flourished in the second half of the 4th millennium along the Tedzen Delta in southern Turkmenia (figs. 4, 5) (11). Soviet archaeologists currently date the Geoksjur Culture around 3100-2700 B.C. on the basis of two doubtful Radiocarbon dates (12). In terms of settlements there are prob? ably no more than three sites to be ascribed to this period in the Tedzen Delta out of nine that existed in the middle of the 4th millennium B.C. during the previous Jalangac phase (Period Namazga II). According to I.N. Hlopin, all these sites were abandoned in two liminary Report on the Second Campaign, Sep? tember-December 1968 ?, EW, XIX, 1969, pp. 283-386. (9) V.M. Mas son, ?

Sarianidi for the Tedzen Delta is subdivided in the following periods: Cagalli Period: 5500-5000 Mondjukli Period: 5000-4700 gap? 4700-4000 Dasliji Period: 4000-3500 Jalangac Period: 3500-3200 Geoksjur Period: 3100-2700 Hapuz Period: 2700-2200 Altyn Period: 2200-1700 Ahucin Period: 1700-1200 Jaz-depe Period: 1200-700 The two Radiocarbon determinations provided for the Geoksjur (Namazga III) Period are: PUL 2: 2750 ? 220 Bin 720: 2760 ? 100 24</page><page sequence="5">phases as the different branches of the delta were progressively drying up (13). The sites range in surface areas around two hectares except for the mound of Geoksjur which extends for over eight hectares. As in the preceding Jalangac phase (3500-3200 B.C.) the popula? tion was still decentralized, divided between a number of small easily linked settlements each of which exploited the available resources of the surrounding territory. The natural consequence of this decentralized settlement pattern might have been the lack of a large ac? cumulated wealth and the relative stability of their culture for over half a millennium. However, in spite of the dissemination of population, their material culture was fundamen? tally uniform. The technical accomplishments in land use of the communities of the Geok? sjur Oasis are evidenced by the construction nd maintenance of a complex irrigation system with canals running for a distance of over ten kilometres (14). In addition to considerable innovations in town planning and technology, the Geoksjur Culture developed new pottery types from the local tradition: the fabrics are sand-tempered, evenly fired and of much bet? ter quality than the chaff-tempered pottery generally in use before. The development of the advanced down-draught kiln was probably responsible for these technical achieve? ments (15). The decoration is mainly represented by geometric and symmetrical motifs with square and polygonal panels often arranged in chess-board patterns (fig. 6) (16). This kind of pottery decoration is present on more than 40% of the total sherds so far discovered at Shahr-i Sokhta I and dated to the earliest known settlement in Sistan (figs. 7-13, 139, 140). Moreover, pottery of Geoksjur type has been recognized in the Quetta Valley (fig. 15) (17). Here in the local prehistoric sequence established by W.A. Fairservis, Jr this type of ware appears abruptly at the end of Period Damb Sadaat I providing a break from the earlier Kechi Beg tradition (18). This change in the pottery types corresponds to a series of remarkable achieve? ments in the material culture: stamp seals, clay figurines, alabaster vessels appear for the first time together with a more complex architecture (19). Settlements of this period are randomly distributed over the restricted space of the valley. Enrichment of material culture, improvement of architecture and expansion of the settlement pattern would therefore be indicative of a substantial change and development in the socio-economic structure. The same types of Geoksjur Ware have also been found at Mundigak in south-western Afghanistan, in levels of Period III (fig. 14) (20). This site lies about 40 km. north-east of the confluence of the Arghandab and Hilmand Rivers. Its position is therefore close to the (13) G.N. Lisicyna, V.M. Masson, V.l. Sa rianidi, I.N. Hlopin, ?

The presence of pottery from southern Turkmenia at Mundigak III is also accompanied by other meaningful cul? tural features, such as collective burials and anthropomorphic figurines with bird-beak fac? es (21). Both V.M. Masson and V.l. Sarianidi consider these close connections related to a diffusion of southern Turkmenian types into the Hilmand Valley and surrounding areas, mainly coming from the Tedzen Delta where they can be documented as the result of a long phylogenetic process. These connections do not show evidence for any significant break from the Dzejtun Culture, dated to the end of the 6th millennium B.C. (22). The Tedzen Delta is abandoned at the end of Namazga III Period and correcting the Soviet Ra? diocarbon determination based on 5535 half-life with MASCA factor (? 1.03), this date can be anticipated to the end of the 4th millennium. The earliest settlement at Shahr-i Sokhta and the remarkable change documented by the Quetta and Mundigak sequences might also relate in some way to the abandonment of the major southern Turkmenian cluster of sites (23). There is a remarkable uniformity of finds between Shahr-i Sokhta and Mundigak. This is so despite the fact that the extraordinary urban development of Sistan would not have been possible without the presence of friendly and culturally similar peoples upstream, where the river course and resultant rich overflow could have been easily diverted and tem? porarily blocked. In a way, the ancient identity of the material culture of the two sites confirms the early existence of a problem that was felt more than once in the later history of Sistan (24). Thousands of potsherds of Periods II and III at Shahr-i Sokhta bear witness to the cultural identity with Mundigak IV1-2; the same is true for the lithic industry, metal working, building techniques, brick typometry, figurines and seals. We do not con? sider it premature to think in terms of a "Hilmand Civilization", developed with those riv? erine resources at the end of the 4 th millennium on the quite uniform platform of Kechi Beg and southern Turkmenian models. For this period, the one possible direct connection with contemporary Mesopotamia is three clay cylinder sealings, a type which disappears at Shahr-i Sokhta during the following periods (figs. 16-18). All three resemble patterns of the Jemdet Nasr Period, together with a cylinder seal found on the surface of the mound in the first season of excavation (25). The following period, Shahr-i Sokhta II, is at present the best preserved and most exposed of the whole site. Extensive excavations have been carried out along the eastern edge of the mound uncovering several buildings (figs. 19, 69) (26). Full-time craftsmanship (21) Ibid., pi. XLI 1-5. (22) V.M.

The pottery manufacture was concentrated in isolated areas and localities, some a considerable distance from the urban complex. The recently excavated site of Tepe Rud-i Biyaban 2, located 29 km. south of Shahr-i Sokhta, exposed fifty downdraught kilns set closely together (fig. 20). The same principle of concentration seems to apply to metallurgy judging from the discovery of a large copper-working site in Afghan Sistan, a few kilometres away from the Iranian border (27). The pottery shows a slow but steady development from the earlier chalcolithic types, from extremely varied and accurate painted motifs to very standardized types in form and decoration (figs. 21-27, 54). Clay figurines, steatite and metal stamp seals (figs. 28-49), as well as the use of copper and stones expand to considerable degree, with evidence of local manufacture. The most interesting discovery from this period is one which gives a completely new significance to the cities that arose in the 4th and 3rd millennia on the Hilmand. Large quantities of lapis lazuli, carnelian, alabaster and turquoise were found together with the instruments to work them, testifying to the presence of an active market for these products at Shahr-i Sokhta. Alabaster is located in the rocky outcrops along the western border of Sistan, but lapis lazuli and carnelian were certainly imported goods from Afghanistan (28). As a matter of fact, more than 90% of the lapis lazuli and carnelian found at Shahr-i Sokhta are waste flakes (figs. 50, 51), which suggest that some sort of preliminary work was carried out here on these valuable materials before they were distributed elsewhere (29). The largest demand for these products, at the beginning of the 3rd millennium, was cer? tainly in Mesopotamia during Jemdet Nasr times, and this could well have been the destina? tion for most of the lapis lazuli polished at Shahr-i Sokhta. As G. Herrmann has recently confirmed, the source of the lapis lazuli used in Mesopotamia was Badakhshan, whence the Hilmand Valley constituted a convenient trade route to eastern Iran (30). The recent discovery of a hoard of gold and silver bowls at Fullol on the south-western border of Badakhshan, fairly close to the lapis mining centres, perhaps confirms the existence of such an extensive network of interchange (31). Some of the bowls are decorated with therio morphic motifs typical of early dynastic Mesopotamia and contemporary Iran (figs. 52, 53). This hoard, however disparate in both geographical and cultural provenance, suggests the diversity of influences concentrated in this region from widely varied areas of the west. (27) G.F. Dales, L.

The pottery types represent standardization, particularly in the painted Buff Ware. Buff Ware patterns are monotonously repeated in a dozen motifs (figs. 55-58) with a parallel increase of the fine Black-on-Grey Ware. Period IV of the Shahr-i Sokhta sequence was first discovered in the 1969 campaign; its extension seems more limited than the area covered by the city of the earlier periods. The most striking feature evident in the finds is certainly the near total end of the painted pottery tradition, while the increasing use of the fast wheel shows a definite improvement in the grace and plasticity of ceramics (figs. 61-63). Shapes of vessels are now marked by articulated profiles with sharp edges, paste is buff or brick-red in color, rarely painted but often slipped or burnished ? two techniques completely absent in earlier levels (fig. 60). A very small percentage of pots have painted decoration or "snakes" applied in relief, both similar in style to known south-eastern Iranian types, notably Yahya IVB and Bampur IV-VI (figs. 64-66). At any rate, despite these important transformations, we get the impres? sion of a basic cultural continuity between Period IV and the preceding periods, above all within certain ceramic shapes and the metallurgical tradition. A further connection is offered by a fragmentary pottery dish also found in the Burnt Building and related in shape and decoration to another specimen from Mundigak IV3 (figs. 67, 68). Our interest in this period is centred on an imposing architectural structure of over 650 sq.m., found on the top of a small elevation close to the south-east corner of the mound (figs. 71, 72). The building has thick walls of unbaked bricks preserved in some places to a height of over three metres (fig. 73). The plan is a complex of three connected buildings around a central courtyard. A narrow corridor runs along the outer wall, probably used for short-cut communications between the southern and northern wings, functionally reminis? cent of similar solutions in use in early dynastic Mesopotamia (32). Stratigraphically this building lies on top of structures of the earlier Period III as recognized in the eastern residential area (fig. 74). The foundations are laid into layers of Period III to a depth of 60-80 cm., while on the western side the whole building was strengthened with a massive mud-brick rampart. There is little doubt that the building saw a violent end; traces of a large and destructive fire are visible in all rooms, crushed jars and burned roof beams are lying on the floors (fig. 59). The burned skeleton of an eleven year-old boy, the right hand clutching a stone pestle, was found in the northernmost pre? served room. The destruction of the large Period IV building probably marks the end of the city itself. No traces of later settlements have been found at Shahr-i Sokhta or any other site in southern Sistan. During the 2nd millennium B.C. the delta of the Hilmand River shifted north and the whole area became completely dry and no longer adaptable for farming and extensive settlement. (32) P. Delougaz, S.

The mound is located in the Soghun Valley, at 28?50' longitude, approximately 225 km. directly south of Kerman and 30 km. north-east of the present town of Dolatabad. Situated at the approxi? mate centre of a mountain valley, about 1200 m. above sea level, the site stands to a height of 19.8 m. and measures 187 m. in diameter. Ceramics are spread from the mound to a distance of 2 km. along the Kish-i Shur River. The Soghun Valley itself is no more than 35 km. in width and 50 km. in length. There is only one other mound in the valley, a 13th-15th century Islamic settlement called Dasht-i Deh, being excavated for the Yahya Project by A. Williamson (34). The Soghun Valley is one of several intermontane valleys located between the Jiroft to the east and the Dolatabad plain (which extends some 60 km. to Hajjiabad) to the west. Tepe Nurabad, a late-4th and early-3rd millennium mound first reported by A. Stein is located 96 km. east of Yahya in the Jiroft Valley. A formid? able, narrow highland pass, the Tang-i Mordan provides direct access to the Jiroft from the Soghun. A direct route also provides access to the Dolatabad plain. Tepe Yahya is thus ideally situated on a route of direct east-west communication. Although prehistoric settlements near Yahya in the Soghun Valley are non-existent, we have recorded 27 4th-mil lennium sites around Dolatabad and (though incompletely surveyed) a number within the Jiroft Valley (35). In all areas of the Jiroft, Dolatabad and the Soghun, the prehistoric set? tlements are located in direct proximity to varyingly sized seasonal and perennial streams. It was our earliest impression that Tepe Yahya was an isolated site that did not support an extensive settlement population. It is now evident that there are a relatively large number of sites of different size and period within a one- or two-day walk of Yahya. Preliminary investigation suggests the presence of widely distant but related large sites with a long and continuous occupation (i.e. Tal-i Iblis, 125 km. north-west and Bampur, 350 km. east) and a random clustering of smaller Period V sites within 50 km. of them. The relationships be? tween the large sites themselves and between the large and small sites are presently being undertaken in our research program; thus the excavation of Yahya, Nurabad and intensive settlement survey. Prior to the initiation of the Yahya Project, south-eastern Iran was an archaeologically (33) Excavations have been supported by the National Science Foundation, Ford Foundation and the Peabody Museum, Harvard University, as well as through private gifts. The excavation has been published in a series of preliminary reports by C.C.

Only further excavation of different sites, analysis of resource utilization and settlement patterns can result in the appreciable understanding the area merits. The pioneer work of A. Stein in 1937 laid a foundation for the understand? ing of the area which has been recently built upon by J. Caldwell (1967) and B. de Cardi (1970) in south-eastern Iran and the Shahr-i Sokhta excavations in Sistan (36). Before summarizing the results of our excavations, it is important to review the meth? ods which have characterized our research design. From 1968 to 1971 we had four cam? paigns of approximately 11 weeks each. We have excavated a main step trench on the south side of the mound of five 10X10 m. squares (A, B, C, D and E), horizontally ex? panding the uppermost two (A and B) squares by another 10X10 m. (AW and BW) (fig. 75). Thus the total exposure of this southern trench represents 700 sq.m. of varying depths within different periods (see below). In 1970 we extended our excavation to the north side of the mound (fig. 76). A second step trench was dug in order to determine the extent of horizontal distribution of periods on the mound and to check the stratigraphic periodization already established on the south side. This north step trench consists of two 10X10 m. squares in the middle of the mound (XB and XC) and two 5X10 m. squares at opposite ends of the slope (XA and XD) ? a total of 300 sq.m. of excavated area on the north side. Excavation procedures were carefully structured to enable us to establish a corpus of stratified material. This corpus would then serve a dual purpose: 1) the recon? struction of a cultural sequence of long duration in an unknown area, and 2) placement of the surface materials gathered from survey and settlement-pattern analysis in a cultural and chronological context. The latter would in turn allow us to suggest patterns of relationship between different sites at different periods of time. The materials gathered from Tepe Yahya have allowed us to successfully accomplish this first purpose while research begins on the second. Our interest in this paper rests in the early periods of occupation at Tepe Yahya. The later Periods I-III (1000 B.C.-500 A.D.) have been summarized elsewhere (37). We briefly summarize here the results of: Period VI Period VA-C Period IVC Period IVB Period IVA 4500-3800 B.C. 3800-3400 B.C. 3400-3000 B.C. 3000-2500 B.C. c. 2200 B.C. (36) See J.R.

Radiocarbon determinations have dated Period VI to the mid-5th millennium for the earliest of its five directly superimposed mud-brick building levels and to the early 4th millennium for its latest construction (38). The structures of Period VI are largely hand fcrmed tauf, with only rare appearances of thumb-impressed bricks so common to Period V. The earliest building level provides the architectural template for all later overlying Period VI architecture (fig. 77) The structures appear in a series of small (storage?) rooms, ap? proximately 1.5 m. square (fig. 78). To date we have excavated almost twenty of these rooms and none of them indicate the presence of doorways, distinguishable activity areas, specialized features or function. Fragments of reed matting and timber found on the poorly preserved floors provide possible traces of fallen roof. The tools of Period VI include implements made of bone and flint. Hafted bone implements were recovered as well as sickle blades. The typical pottery of this period is a coarse, handmade, chaff-tempered ware in the form of bowls and large jars. Though never exceeding 5%, there is an increase in the appearance of burn? ishing on a red or brown slipped finer chaff-tempered ware within the five levels of Period VI. A large circular wall appeared in a limited area in the latest building of Period VI (39). Within the foundation rubble of this wall and in the associated rooms we recovered some seventeen sherds of a wholly unknown bichrome ware (fig. 79) (40). This type of ceramic, in the shape of small bowls of fine buff with geometric painted designs in black and in red, is without parallel. Save for this new type of pottery, Period VI suggests great uniformity in both architecture and ceramics. In one of the small rooms of the earliest period we recovered a carved steatite female figurine, 32 cm. in height, resting on top of a cache of flint tools and decoratively carved bone (fig, 90) (41). Preliminary analysis of the late neolithic economy at Tepe Yahya shows domesticated cattle to have been of primary importance, followed by sheep and goat (42). The domesticated plants include a variety of cereal grains. In the Soghun, Jiroft and Dolatabad areas, crop raising today involves irrigation; dry farming would provide an extremely marginal sub? sistence. Period V The transition to Period V at Tepe Yahya occurs without any break in cultural con? tinuity. This is clearly evidenced in architectural, ceramic and lithic remains. There are (38) Radiocarbon dates are listed in Lamberg Karlovsky, opp. citt., 1970, 1971, 1972. (39) See Lamberg-Karlovsky, op. cit., 1970, pi. 40, fig. 54 for illustration and discussion.

The ceramics throughout the three building levels of Period VA-C at Yahya can be paralleled at some distance to the east and west. Period VC has (less than 5%) painted Black-on-Red paralleled at Chah Husseini and Iblis, II, III, while VB has a Black on-Buff (5%) paralleled at Bakun and Susa A (figs. 80, 83). The last phase of Period VA sees an increase in Black-on-Red Wares {fig. 85) with the introduction of bevelled-rim bowls (about 8 fragments), undecorated fine orange wares (2%) and Black-on-Grey Paint? ed Ware (fig. 89). Also seen in greater numbers are an unparalleled bichrome ware with black-and-red-painted geometric designs over a buff slip (fig. 86). Throughout Period V there is a continuous increase in the utilization of imported re? sources unknown from Period VI: obsidian blades (total 14 pieces); turquoise and carnelian beads; mother of pearl beads and carved figures; alabaster beads, bracelets and statuary; and a variety of flints derived from unknown sources (figs. 91, 93, 94). Steatite, evident in Period VI, is continuously used throughout all periods for the production of beads, bowls, and later, cylinder seals (fig. 95). Metal tools are first documented in VB in the form of simple chisels and pins. They are manufactured by smelting, hot and cold forging of unal? loyed arsenical copper ore (43). The architecture of Period VC shows continuity with Period VI (fig. 77). Individual rooms (2.5X3.5 m.) with hearth, chimney and storage vessels are articulated with smaller rooms of varying size, forming a simple house complex (figs. 81, 82). Over 25% of the bricks are a standardized mold-made size (30X15X15 cm.) though individual bricks often vary (up to 80X15X15 cm.). The economy in Period V evidences the diminished use of domesti? cated cattle with an increase in the percentage of sheep and goat (42). The greater majority of sites in the settlement distribution around Yahya are of Period V. They are small, averaging one hectare, and numerous (as stated above, 27 were located around Dolatabad). Following Period V times, the sites are fewer but larger in size. Period IV Period IVC consists of a single building complex which contains a remarkable associa? tion of cultural materials (figs. 102, 103). There is a continuity of the Black-on-Buff Painted Wares of Period V (figs. 105, 106), the Black-on-Grey and bevelled-rim bowls (figs. 101, 107, 108). The characteristic Black-on-Red seems to have disappeared (44). New wares include Jemdet Nasr polychrome (fig. 104), club-rim bowls (fig. 109), snakes applied in relief (43) Metallurgical analysis on selected materials of Period V-IV have been undertaken by R. Tylecote, University of Newcastle-on-Tyne, Eng? land. His complete report will be published as part of the final reports on Tepe Yahya.

The latter types were present in very scarce quantity in Period VA. The brick size measures 25X25X12 cm. The wall of one room had a large, fired drain (fig. 100) through it and a second room contained a water well cleared, to date, to a depth of 2 m. The ceramics from Yahya IVC can be paralleled with sites in Mesopotamia, the Persian Gulf, Sistan and Baluchistan. Other materials found resting on the floor of this building are of great interest. From one room we have recovered six complete Proto-Elamite tablets and eighty-four blank tablets (the latter suggesting their local production) (figs. 104, 111, 112) (45). From the same two rooms several dozen cylin? der-sealing impressions, many fragmentary, some complete, have been recovered (figs. 104, 115-119). A surface find outside this building yielded two cylinder seals of Jemdet Nasr type (figs. 104, 120-122). The activities within and functions of this building are indicated by the materials recovered and may be interpreted as follows: 1) storage: small rooms with large storage jars; 2) record keeping: both blank and written tablets; 3) receiving and shipment of goods: the cylinder-sealing impression of one style and actual seals of another style. A change in architectural orientation is evident in the building of IVB resting directly above the IVC complex. A single room, 2.5X7.5 m., with small storage rooms containing unfired clay bins was uncovered (fig. 125). The pottery is continuous from IVC, with a decrease in painted wares and an increase in plain wares (figs. 126-129). Still present are the snake relief motif (fig. 113), burnished Grey Wares (fig. 126), Black-on-Grey, and bev elled-rim bowls (fig. 101). A considerable number of solid-footed chalices of Jemdet Nasr E.D.I type have been recovered (figs. 104, 114). A single cylinder seal and one early Persian Gulf-type seal are also present (46). This IVB complex is sealed by 1.5 m. of fill separated by several surfaces but no architecture (fig. 103). From Period IVB, including the lower architecture, but principally in the fill above, hundreds of fragments of carved steatite bowls, beads and objects were found (figs. 96-99) (47). The motifs on the bowls can be readily paralleled on numerous Mesopotamian sites, from the island of Tarut, Saudi Arabia and from the lower levels of Mohenjo-daro (48). Analysis of metal tools of IVB shows them to be of alloyed, arsenical and tin bronze (figs. 123, 124) (49). The steatite material at Yahya IVB shows considerable evidence for its local production in the form of incompletely cored vessels, large worked lumps of steatite ("ingots") and broken, incompletely carved vessels (fig. 98). To date we have located four source areas. Steatite outcrops with evidence of mining have been located within 32 km. of Yahya. With evidence for both source availability and local production it is entirely possible that Yahya (45) For full illustration see Lamberg-Karlov sky, op. cit., 1971.

Several objects indicating bead pro? duction and the use of boring techniques have also been recovered from IVB. On the south side of the mound, IVB is resting beneath a large building, whereas on the northern side there are three superimposed building levels of Period IVA (fig. 134). The duration and date of IVA is still undetermined though the last centuries of the 3rd millen? nium seem most probable. Ceramics are substantially different. Painted wares consist of a new black and red bichrome on a buff orange (less than 1%) (fig. 131) while the painted ware of IVB and C are wholly absent. One sherd of Kaftari Ware with a typical painted bird motif was found in this period. The dominant ware is a plain red or orange, rarely slipped, in the shape of open bowls with different firing and tempering techniques than those used in the earlier IVB (figs. 132, 133). More than 310 different potter's marks have been recorded. There are large rooms, each with a hearth and chimney (fig. 134). Small finds are relatively rare, save for a few plain steatite bowl fragments, a decorated plaque with architectural facade (fig. 136), a sherd with Harappan sealing (figs. 137, 138), two cylinder seals (figs. 121, 122), and the head of a clay figurine, possibly related to this period (fig. 135). Following Period IVA there is a gap in the Yahya settlement. Occupation reoccurs at the site in the early 1st millennium B.C. (51). Distribution of Types and Patterns of Interchange On Chart I we have gathered together a list of classes of finds which are significant in aligning the material culture of the major sites within Mesopotamia, eastern Iran and the Persian Gulf at the end of the 4th millennium B.C. This plotting system will show the degree of correlation of these finds between the different areas and may reasonably suggest the existence of cultural interaction. Polychrome bi-conical jars with nose lugs are found in southern Mesopotamia from Uruk IV times through E.D.I (52). This type is also present in northern Mesopotamia at the site of Tepe Gawra in Period VIII, as well as in the Diyala Valley at the major sites of Tell Asmar and Khafajeh where it is reported through all the Jemdet Nasr levels of Sin Temple I-IV (53). W. Nagel considers polychrome bi-conical jars to be one of (50) A program of neutron activation is being carried out at Brookhaven Laboratories by Dr M. Sayre and P. Kohl. The results of many samples analyzed from Yahya, Tarut and Meso? potamia are at present being graphed. The "steati? te" from Yahya has on analysis been shown to be chlorite. (51) J. Humphries is at present preparing his Ph.D. thesis on materials from the 1st millennium at Tepe Yahya. (52) See D. Hansen, ? The Relative Chronology of Mesopotamia, Pt. 2.

In the neighbouring Kharun Valley this type appears in Susa Ca together with the earliest evidence of Proto-Elamite writing (55). J. Perrot informs us that in his recent excavations at Susa, however, bi-conical jars and bev elled-rim bowls appear throughout levels 17-22. The first Proto-Elamite tablets are found in level 16 where no bevelled-rim bowTls are documented. This differs considerably from Tepe Yahya where tablets and bevelled rim bowls are in direct association in the building complex of IVC. At Susa bi-conical jars have a duration through period C with geometric motifs and a change to naturalistic scenes in Susa D, generally correlated with E.D.I-II. In the excavations of Tal-i Ghazir, similar polychrome biconical jars were found together with a fragment of a Proto-Elamite tablet, bevelled-rim bowls and a geometric cylinder seal depict? ing linked ovals of Jemdet Nasr type (56). In the light of latest discoveries, Jemdet Nasr seems to have included an area far beyond the Mesopotamian flood plain. Recent archaeological research in the Persian Gulf has brought to light the existence of Jemdet Nasr material on the island of Bahrain and the Oman peninsula (57). At Bahrain the stratigraphic sequence begins with the earliest building of the Barbar temple and the so-called "pre-city I" with the lowest levels of the Qalcat al-Bahrain settlement (58). More specifically, a single sherd of Jemdet Nasr poly? chrome bi-conical jar is reported from Barbar I and in larger quantity from the stone burial chambers of Hafit in the Buraimi Oasis. There are also indications of a Jemdet Nasr presence on the island of Tarut, off the Saudi Arabian coast north-west of Bahrain (59). At Barbar I the most common ceramic class, associated with the Jemdet Nasr sherd, is a plain brick red ware, well fired and grit sand chalk-tempered which also appears in the debris under? lying the "City F levels at QaPat al-Bahrain (60). It is mainly characterized by rimless glob? ular jars and ovoidal ones with short cylindrical neck, both decorated by horizontal parallel ribs. Present evidence suggests that a second Mesopotamian-related horizon in the Persian Gulf appeared during Jemdet Nasr times. This followed the al cUbaid settlements in the north-eastern province of Saudi Arabia and is recorded on over 60 sites along the coastal salt marshes with an inland penetration up to 40 miles. These two periods do not seem to overlap in terms of settlement distribution; Jemdet Nasr towns and tombs are found only on the islands and on the far distant peninsula of Oman. The presence of both periods is (54) W. Nagel, Djamdet Nasr-Kulturen und fr?hdynastische Buntkeramiker, Berlin, 1964, pis. 4-10. (55) L. LeBreton, ?

The major indication is given by a single bi-conical jar of gray, chalk-tempered ware. (60) Mortensen, op. cit.\ Bibby, op. cit.y p. 139. 35</page><page sequence="16">suggested only on the island of Tarut at the unexcavated mound at the local "women's bath" (61). At Tepe Yahya, polychrome bi-conical jars with nose lugs are attested for the first time in Period IVC in the form of two large, intact storage jars (fig. 104 A, B). There were also a number of polychrome sherds representing less than 1% of the total pottery found (%. 106). This type of vessei does not seem to be present further east. At Shahr-i Sokhta I, how? ever, there are bi-conical jars, made of Buff Ware, which include the familiar attributes of nose lugs and everted rim on short cylindrical neck (figs. 139, 140). It is a type exclusively characteristic of Period I, disappearing completely later in the sequence. It is important to note that at Shahr-i Sokhta I these distinctive features of Jemdet Nasr pottery are found in strict association with other sherds bearing painted motifs of southern Turkmenian tradition, thus providing a positive link between southern Turkmenia and Mesopotamia. Apart from the polychrome bi-conical jars, other characteristic types of pottery share a similar geographical distribution in Jemdet Nasr times: bevelled-rim bowls, solid-footed conical goblets and, to a more limited extent, knobbed ware types. In Mesopotamia the typical bevelled-rim bowl first appears at Uruk in Period IIIC (E-an-na XII); in contem? porary levels of Sin Temple I-II at Khafajeh (62) as well as in the Nippur sequence in levels XI-XII (63). This type of vessel seems to be slightly earlier at Susa (64). The limited pub ished evidence from the major protoliterate site of Choga Mish, tends to confirm a chrono? logical priority for Khuzistan over Mesopotamia for this specific type of vessel (65). At Tal-i Ghazir bevelled-rim bowls are reported prior to the Proto-Elamite period (66). Their ap? pearance precedes Proto-Elamite IVC at Yahya as well, being first noted in Period VA (fig. 84) (6T). The Yahya- and Susa-type bevelled-rim bowls are of smaller diameter and somewhat taller than their later Mesopotamian counterparts. The classic Mesopotamian type is widely diffused in Jemdet Nasr times; they are reported from numerous sites on the Iranian Plateau: Susa Ca-c, Godin Tepe V, Sialk IV, Choga Mish, Iblis VI and Yahy&lt; IVC (68). None are re? ported from the Persian Gulf nor from the Iranian Plateau north cf Sialk or east of Yahya. Thus, the distributional pattern of this type roughly corresponds to the ' igros chain of south (61) Bibby, op. cit., pp. 369-72. (62) Hansen, op. cit. (63) Hansen, op. cit. (64) An earlier type of bevelled-rim bowl which appears at Yahya, Susa and Tal-i Ghazir is smaller but taller than the classic Mesopotamian type. This observation has been made independ? ently by Caldwell, op. cit., 1968; R.H. Dyson, Jr, Excavation on the Acropolis of Susa and Prob? lems of Susa A, B, C, unpublished Ph.D. thesis, Harvard, 1968 and by C.C. Lamberg-Korlovsky, P. Kohl, ?

Conical solid-footed goblets appear in the E-an-na sequence at Uruk IV and level XII of Nippur (69). In the Diyala Valley this type is more closely related to E.D.I (70). Outside Mesopotamia they appear at Susa C, Yahya IVC/B and possibly also at Barbar I on the island of Bahrain (71). The distributional picture of knobbed ware is far less certain. Small round-shaped jars with applied knobs or studs are characteristic in the Diyala Valley ot E.D.II-III and even later (72). P. Delougaz emphasized the connections between this type of pottery in Mesopo? tamia and similar vessels at Mohenjo-daro (73). This parallel has been presented as a major correlation linking Mesopotamia with the Indus Valley in the middle of the 3rd millennium, mainly during E.D.III (74). Five sherds of indisputable knobbed ware have recently been discovered at Yahya in a reliable stratigraphic context of Period IVC associated with poly? chrome bi-conical jars and solid-footed conical goblets (figs. 89, 108, 114). This association is indirectly confirmed by a single vessel of knobbed ware found at Sialk IV in a Proto Elamite context (75). The archaeological evidence for this class of pottery is still far too uneven to provide a useful date or a significant correlation. There is little evidence for knobbed ware on contemporary sites of the eastern Iranian Plateau and southern Turkmenia. The one find of this type is reported from T.J. Arne's excavation at Shah Tepe on the Gurgan Plain (76). However, at Shahr-i Sokhta I-early II, a few bull vases have been found (fig. 141), a kind of vessels related to well-known similar examples found at Khafajeh, Sin Tem? ple IV-V (77). The pottery of the southern Iranian Plateau and the northern shores of the Arabian coast exhibit strong cultural relations with Mesopotamia during Jemdet Nasr times. The discovery of 51 cylinder sealings on the floor of the Yahya IVC building confirms this remarkable degree of cultural integration. The sealings are of two basic types: 1) depicting naturalistic scenes which include cattle, bezoar and lions, often portrayed in a stylized land? scape (figs. 115, 116); 2) simple and complex geometric patterns (figs. 117, 118). Both of these types are found in direct association on the floors of the rooms. The first type is readily paralleled at Susa C (78), the latter in Sin Temple IV at Khafajeh (79). Just as strik? ing in their direct parallels are two glazed steatite cylinder seals from Yahya IVC (and as? sociated sealings; figs. 104 E, 120) with Sin Temple IV (80). (69) See Hansen, op. cit.

(80) Ibid., pis. 14:121, 16:150. 37</page><page sequence="18">The incontestable evidence for connections between the greater Mesopotamian flood plain and the eastern Iranian Plateau is strengthened by the association of ten Proto-Elamite tablets at Tepe Yahya IVC. This discovery marks the easternmost extension of pro to literate tablets. Identical tablets have been found in Susa Cb, Sialk IV and Tal-i Ghazir with the same associations recorded at Yahya IVC: polychrome bi-conical jars, solid-footed coni? cal goblets, bevelled-rim bowls, naturalistic and geometric-decorated seals (fig. 104). There is no reason to assume that Yahya IVC and contemporary sites of the Arabian peninsula were provincial dependencies or epigons of Mesopotamia. The nature of basic continuity from Yahya V to IVC and the existence of a remarkable al cUbaid horizon along the northern Arabian coast provide evidence of a multi-directional cultural influence (81). The developing cultural uniformity evident all over the south-western plateau and the Persian Gulf from Godin Tepe to Yahya and Oman is to be seen as the result of an increasing cultural interac? tion over a large territory between areas previously less well integrated (map 1). A similar picture is emerging from southern Turkmenia and the north-eastern Iranian Plateau. The Shahr-i Sokhta I horizon has its most significant connections with the late Namazga III Culture on the Tedzen Delta and with Mundigak III. On the basis of pottery taxonomy the degree of cultural integration in this wide area (southern Turkmenia, Sistan, the Hilmand and Quetta Valleys) seems equal to that reported for the contemporary Jemdet Nasr sphere. Chess-board stepped-triangle patterns painted on Buff Ware, together with certain distinctive shapes (hemispherical bowls, oval jars) and clay, bent-body anthropomor? phic figurines are some of the most striking features shared over this wide area (figs. 7-11). However, there are also pottery types in the Hilmand and Quetta Valleys which are in as? sociation with Namazga III ceramics but are completely alien to the Turkmenian tradition; most particularly, the Black/Red-on-Grey Wares discussed in detail below. The distribution of southern Turkmenian materials in the Hilmand Valley outlines the existence of another large interaction sphere over the north-eastern plateau of Iran quite distinct from the Jemdet Nasr interaction area. The only concrete parallels linking the two interaction spheres are three cylinder sealings from Shahr-i Sokhta I and a fragmentary steatite cylinder seal from the surface (figs. 16-18). Although the three sealings have no exact Jemdet Nasr comparisons (82), the cylindrical seal with hatch-edged triangles is readily paralleled at the Sin Temple IV at Khafajeh (83). It will be observed that Chart II introduces a different set of geographical areas and sites and eliminates some from Chart I. The analysis of cultural remains between the geo? graphical areas, i.e. Turkmenistan and Mesopotamia, and the areas listed on Chart II suggest a decrease in the earlier expansive integration over large areas, an increase in regional inte? gration, and a quantitative decrease in the number of different types connecting each area.

The elimination of Mesopotamia and Turkmenistan on Chart II reflects the absence of a clear picture for these areas. Within Mesopotamia the Early Dynastic Period is still relatively unexplored and lacks coherent archaeological understanding. During this time it appears that a considerable reg ionalization took place. A distinctive segregation of culture areas in the Diyala, southern Adesopotamia, Khuzistan and Akkad can be isolated. It has been argued that this is a reflec? tion of the rise of the city-state in the case of Mesopotamia (84). The nature and degree of regional and inter-regional interaction at this time will be dealt with later in this paper. Soviet archaeologists argue that a nucleation of settlement took place in Turkmenia fol? lowing the abandonment of the Tedzen Delta in terminal Namazga III times at the sites of Altyn Tepe, Namazga Tepe and upstream on the Tedzen River at Hapuz Tepe (85). The Namazga IV Period is best represented at Hapuz and Ulug Tepe though a less clear under? standing exists than for the preceding Namazga III. The materials selected in Chart II depend on the sequences established at Shahr-i Sokhta and Tepe Yahya. Both sites, in fact, represent the best detailed sequence of stratified materials available within their respective areas. We will first correlate these two sites, the extent and degree of their interrelations and proceed from there to correlate them individ? ually with other geographical areas. Although there are generalized similarities in the technological, metallurgical, ceramic, architectural and lithic industries, we will concentrate on specific items that directly link the sites. The periods involved are Shahr-i Sokhta II-IV and Yahya IVB. One of the major types of ceramic uniting Shahr-i Sokhta and Yahya is a painted Black on-Grey Ware (figs. 143-146). This type of pottery is, in fact, a horizon style for the en? tirety of the north-east Iranian-Baluchistan interaction sphere. A detailed description fol? lows: 1) a reduced grey ware; 2) evenly fired at temperatures between 900-1100? C; 3) sand-tempered with homogeneous texture; 4) hardness ranging from 3-4 on the Mohs scale, one of the hardest potteries pro? duced in south-western Asia in the 3rd millennium; 5) smooth surface, rarely polished or shaved (when shaving is evident the marks are identically produced over the wide area of its distribution: Quetta, Shahr-i Sokhta and Yahya); 6) thickness range from 3 to 6 mm.; (84) R. McC. Adams, The Evolution of Urban Society, Chicago, 1966, pp. 79-169. (85) V.l. Sarianidi, ? Hapuz-depe kak pamjat niki epohi bronzy ?, KSIA, XCVIII, 1964, pp. 60-5. 39</page><page sequence="20">7) shapes dominantly restricted to open bowls and small carinated bi-conical jars (vessels with a volume exceeding 16 c.c. are extremely rare; 8) painted motifs applied on the outer rim except on interior of vessel when combs or curvilinear swastikas dominate; 9) paint ranges from a dark red to black on grey. There is evidence that the dark red on grey is an earlier variant at Shahr-i Sokhta and Yahya. Painted, geometric, horizontal bands, restricted to the upper half of the vessel, are the most common motif on the bi-conical jars. This type was first recognized by W.A. Fairser vis, Jr as Faiz Mohammed Grey Ware in the Quetta Valley of Pakistan and later more gen? erally defined as Faiz Mohammed Painted Ware (86). The remarkably wide distribution of this pottery with similar painted motifs has not been fully appreciated (map 4). Stein recorded the presence of this type on both site surfaces and in his excavations at Bampur, Khurab, Damin and Shah-i Tump (8T). Fairservis has noted Black-on-Grey Wares in the Quetta Valley (Period Damb Sadaat II/III), on the major sites of the Zhob and Loralei Valleys of north Baluchistan and in Afghan Baluchistan (88). Its presence is reported from the surface sites clustered around the Rud-i Biyaban area in Sistan. The stratigraphic excavations at Shahr-i Sokhta and Yahya place this Black-on-Grey Ware in an associated context. At Shahr-i Sokhta it first appears in Period I and becomes increasingly common in II/III. Its distribution along the Hilmand River is confirmed in the Mundigak III-IV2 levels. First appearing in Yahya VA it becomes more common in IVC and early IVB (fig. 107). It is known at sites immediately east of Yahya in the Jiroft. B. de Cardi, in recent excavations at Bampur reports Black-on-Grey Wares dominantly in Period IV-V (89). Beyond the borders of present-day Iran, it has been recorded in Oman at Umm an-Nar on the coast and inland, in the Buraimi Oasis graves and settlement (90). Al? though recorded from the Surab region, its distribution in eastern Baluchistan is generally not definable. We note that not a single sherd of this distinctive and widely distributed ware is known from the Indus, Mesopotamia or southern Turkmenia. Its distribution defines it as a horizon style within a single interaction sphere (map 4). At Shahr-i Sokhta and Yahya the earliest appearance of this type is characterized by dark red paint (incompletely fired) though in later times both dark red paint and evidence of poor firing disappear. These two stages of development in technology and/or style are duplicated in the Faiz Mohammed Grey Ware of Damb Sadaat II/III in association with Quetta and Namazga III patterns. (86) W.A.

In Period IV at Yahya, ap? proximately 10% of the ceramic inventory consists of a painted Black-on-Red (fig. 127). This type of pottery has a local distribution in the Jiroft and Dolatabad areas. In the form of large globular jars, the upper half decorated in geometric and curvilinear motifs, the ware is a coarse to medium grit with a red-slipped or plain orange-red surface. The designs in? clude meandering black lines which terminate in snake heads and plain geometric lozenges between horizontal bands (fig. 127). A second pottery type at Yahya which does not have parallels at Shahr-i Sokhta is a plain buff to orange ware with appliqued motifs (fig. 113). The applique is both meandering and parallel geometric lines terminating, again, in snake heads. The shape is usually in the form of large storage jars. Parallels for this pottery occur at the settlement sites of the Buraimi Qalcat al-Bahrain and Umm an-Nar, Anjira IV, in Susa D levels and at Mundigak IV (91). Painted snakes on ceramics are also present at Yahya IVB. At Sialk, on the central Iranian Plateau, multiple snakes painted on large cylindrical beakers appear as early as Period III4.7. The importance of this widely distributed motif is underscored by the dis? covery of a silver beaker at Fullol in south-western Badakhshan. The snake motifs are de? picted with triangular heads, incised eyes and checkered or parallel lines incised on the body. The snakes at Anjira IV are identical to those of contemporary Yahya IVB in placement on the vessel and style (92). At Yahya IVB Burnished Grey Ware continues from Period IVC. Pedestal chalices and open bowls are characteristic shapes (figs. 108, 129, 130). The pedestal chalices appear in a buff, red-slipped smooth ware as well as the Black-on-Grey. The Burnished Grey Wares and pedestal chalices are readily paralleled at Bampur IV-VI. At Yahya the Burnished Grey Wares represent less than 1% of the total ceramic assemblage. J. Perrot reports a limited quantity of streak-burnished Grey Ware from Susa A times. There are no parallels at Shahr-i Sokhta for the Burnished Grey Ware (fig. 110), applique ware (fig. 113), comb-incised ware (fig. 128) or footed plates (lids?). Almost all of these can be paralleled at Bampur, however. It would appear that Yahya pottery represents an intensification of a local production tradition. Only limited types have parallels in the Persian Gulf (applique) or Sistan (Black-on-Grey). Though the ceramics seem to be poor indicators of distant communication patterns, the seals, steatite, etc. from Yahya indeed suggest exploitation of specific resources which tie the areas together. The general evidence from the pottery collections at Shahr-i Sokhta II/III indicates (91) Casal, op. cit., fig. 73; see also note 92. (92) See Frifelt, op. cit., 1970, fig. 7; B. de Cardi, ? Excavations and Reconnaissance in Kalat, West Pakistan - The Prehistoric Sequence in the Surab Region ?, PkA, II, 1965, pi. VIII, 3-7; Le Breton, op. cit. 41</page><page sequence="22">that the majority of Black-on-Buff shapes and designs are not paralleled with types from Yahya IVB. The most common shape of this Black-on-Buff Ware is a pear-shaped vessel, some 8-10 cm. in height, decorated with geometric or stylized goats on the upper cone (fig. 21). It is most common in Period II but also appears in Periods III and IV. There are related types at Mundigak IV2 (93). This common type at Shahr-i Sokhta would appear to have its greatest distribution in the Hilmand Valley. The only incontestably related specimens are from Bampur III-IV (94). The concentration of this common type in the Hilmand Valley and its near absence beyond this area, points again to a ceramic intensification and the devel? opment of a local ceramic tradition. This parallels the situation at Yahya and forms part of the nexus of our model of cultural development (see below). The same limited distribution of these pear-shaped beakers is consistent with the equally limited distribution of the ogival, ovoidal jars and small, bi-conical jars with expanded rim above cylindrical neck (fig. 25). The evidence for strict correlations between Shahr-i Sokhta II/III and Mundigak IV1.2 can be confirmed in the presence of an important "brandy cup" shape characteristic of Mundigak IV. Though relatively common at Mundigak IV there are no more than twelve such sherds found at Shahr-i Sokhta (figs. 26, 27). On a recent survey along the coast of Iranian Baluchistan, W. Fitz, Jr discovered a copper-bronze stamp seal on the surface of a cairn burial (fig. 1). The seal is the shape Fig. 1 - Saidich Cairn Burial. Copper-bronze stamp seal from cairn burial. Seal was found on surface of the cairn between rocks where several sherds of Black-on-Gray Ware were also found. of a scorpion. Several Black-on-Grey sherds were found around the cairn, of a type previ? ously discussed. The cairn is located near the village of Saidich, an area reported by Stein to contain several cairns (see note 36). This type of copper-bronze stamp seal has a wide distribution; examples are reported from Namazga Tepe, Shahr-i Sokhta, Deh Morasi Ghundai, Bampur, etc. Yahya IVB, as previously described, consists of a single building level with numerous floors and surfaces (the latter without architecture) and a metre and a half of deposit above the lowest IVB building level (fig. 103). Some ceramic types from Shahr-i Sokhta show (93) De Cardi, op. cit., 1970, fig. 29, n. 305. (94) De Cardi, op. cit., 1970, fig. 43:438-69. 42</page><page sequence="23">'''' /J^r** H?s"n,?"

At Shahr-i Sokhta however, there is a break in the ceramic tradition with the first appearance of a Black-and-Red-orange Burnished Ware simi? lar to that of Bampur IV-VI. In the burning destruction of the Period IV building at Shahr-i Sokhta a few sherds of applique red ware and an intact canister jar decorated with parallel friezes of stylized running goats were recovered. Both of these types are paralleled at Bampur IV-VI as well as at Umm an-Nar and Kulli in southern Baluchistan (95). This new ceramic horizon is marked by the incised Grey Ware, a type which parallels the distri? bution of the earlier Black-on-Grey though in a more restricted area {map 4). Present archaeological evidence suggests that the two types are chronologically complementary; they are mutually distinct in time and association. Incised Grey Ware is usually burnished and of cylindrical shape, produced only in vessels with flat bottom and everted rim. Its colour ranges from dark to light grey. The overall incised decoration appears in two distinct design motifs: a frieze of hatched articulating triangles and the well known '"hut-pot" motif. The latter probably depicts reed architecture in combination with a simple, geometric linear pat? tern in a sort of horror vacui. We note that horror vacui appears as a stylistic parameter of the later Baluchistan cultures, i.e. Kulli, Nal, the Indus Civilization and Cemetery H at Harappa. The distribution of incised Grey Ware recorded includes numerous examples from the graves at Umm an-Nar in the Persian Gulf (96), Yahya (97), Bampur (98) (figs. 147-151), on sites surveyed and excavated by Stein, i.e. Katukan, Khurab and Da min (99). M. Tosi's recent work at Damin reports further examples of this incised Grey Ware directly associated with painted ceramics of Bampur IV-VI (10?). A. Hakemi has re? covered several full vessels of this type in the extraordinarily rich tombs at Shahdad, a site well irrigated by qan?ts, north-east of Kerman on the very edge of the Dasht-i Lut (101). These tombs are at present covered by large aeolic formations and are still unrelated to any nearby contemporary settlement. The incised Grey Ware at Shahr-i Sokhta appears to be identical in type to those at Shahdad and are restricted to the destruction level of the Period IV Burnt Building. The stratigraphic distinction at Shahr-i Sokhta is clear: the incised Grey Ware is found above the floors of the Burnt Building whereas the Black-on-Grey is found directly beneath this complex. The incised Grey Ware is found in association with the earliest Red-and-Grey streak burnished and Black-on-Grey Bampur IV4 Wares (fig. 60). The sites of Shahdad and Shahr-i Sokhta mark the northernmost extension of this type, Oman the southernmost (figs. 65, 66). The restricted distribution of the incised Grey Ware is evidenced by the absence of this ware in Pakistan Baluchistan. If further research confirms this restricted distribution it will (95) De Cardi, op. cit., 1970, fig. 43, 479 81; Thorvildsen, op. cit., fig. 22; Frifelt, op. cit.f 1971, fig. 2, F.

It is at this time that evidence suggests an increase in water conservation techniques with the use of gabarbands and minor dams (102). Incised Grey Ware is not found west of Tepe Yahya where only two surface sherds of this type are reported (103). Several hundred pieces of steatite vessels with identically incised motifs are present from Yahya, however. At Bampur IV-VI and at Shahr-i Sokhta the situation appears to be reversed: incised Grey Ware is dominant with respect to incised steatite (see below for further discussion of steatite). This may reflect an absence of steatite resource in these areas or a chronological discrepancy ? the incised Grey Ware being later (?). This detailed taxonomic approach leads us to the following preliminary conclusions: it would appear that ceramic parallels between the different sites are not quantitatively great in either specific numbers or shared types. There is little doubt that this approach, detail? ing specifically shared types of many disparate sites covering a large area, is the only way to establish both a relative chronological contemporaneity and a definition of interaction spheres. It provides also, as discussed below, a model for ordering and understanding the distribution of this previously ill-defined material. The ceramic evidence has allowed us to point to strong similarities in specific types between the following sites: Oman Yahya Shahr-i Sokhta Umm an-Nar Hili IVB IV III II Jemdet Nasr IVC Bampur VI IV Shahdad Early Horizon Mundigak IV, IV2 IV, III Evidence of Technical Progress M. Tosi has located an important pottery production centre in Iranian Sis tan at Tepe Rud-i Biyaban 2 {fig. 20). Pottery from this kiln site is related to Shahr-i Sokhta III and suggests that the ceramic technology has improved considerably from earlier times. The (102) W.A. Fairservis, Jr, ?The Harappan Civilization - New Evidence and More Theory ?, American Museum Novitates, 2055, 1961, fig. 1. (103) See note 97. 44</page><page sequence="103">kilns at Tepe Rud-i Biyaban 2 are all single-chambered, down-draught type, averaging 3.5 m. in length with a capacity of 1.5 cu.m. (fig. 142). The firing temperatures appeared to have quickly reached an excess of 1100? C, as evidenced by the quantities of wasters stacked around the outside of the kilns. This technological change is integrated and reflected in major changes in the social order, i.e. an evident concentration of full-time ceramic craftsmen. This implies that a level of social organization had been achieved which enabled maximum specialization and division of labour with minimal numbers of craftsmen producing ware for an increasing population. This complexity is paralleled only within a developing urban complex. Our reconstruction of the interaction areas of the eastern Iranian Plateau in the first half of the 3rd millennium B.C. has concentrated on the distribution of pottery types, having little to do with any historical approach to a problem. The importance of pottery has been based more on the quantity and degree of preservation than on its value at the time of its production. The information provided by ceramics is well integrated with the large quantities of stone materials from the excavations of Shahr-i Sokhta and Yahya (fig. 50). Compared to pottery, the manufacture of stone vessels, beads, seals, etc. is more reliable for the reconstruction of cultural relations, trade networks and the means of tech? nological production. Both at Shahr-i Shokhta and Yahya finished and unfinished products, stone wasters, tools and several kinds of stored resources testify to the existence of primary specialized activities performed by significant groups of craftsmen situated in the major cen? tres. The role of full- or part-time specialists in the social order at Shahr-i Sokhta and Yahya will be discussed in detail below. We suggest that this evolving craft specialization, in? creasingly alienated from food-producing activities, is a reflection of an interaction process between distinct groups within a community and between different communities. It results in the establishment of a hierarchical system within these same and between different com? munities. The present archaeological evidence for metal working in eastern Iran is still limited to the production of a few finished products and crucibles (see below). Though copper-bronze metallurgical techniques begin to show an increasing degree of sophistication, they do not equal the elaborate stone working industry which reached its climax in the first half of the 3rd millennium. The distribution of metal objects is not as geographically extensive as that of stone materials (104). Too little of Period I at Shahr-i Sokhta has been excavated to determine the extent of stone craftsmanship. Period IV, though more fully excavated, does not provide any evi? dence of an extensive stone industry. The elaboration of stone manufacture is limited to Shahr-i Sokhta II/III. Excavations suggest that this was the time of maximum horizontal settlement at Shahr-i Sokhta; at least 75 hectares being inhabited. Several different types of stone were available in the flood plain of Sistan and the (io4) por a map Qf ore distribution in Iran, see Caldwell, op. cit., 1961, p. 12. 45</page><page sequence="104">surrounding Pliocene hills. Two classes of local type were especially used: 1) basalt, diasper and flint were widely employed in the chipped-flint industry and 2) several kinds of alabas? ter were used for bead and vessel production. Quartz was also randomly available. Its use was limited to the manufacture of pear-shaped pendants. Also used, but not locally available, were lapis lazuli, carnelian, steatite, turquoise and chrysoprase. From the locally available stone resources there are an abundant number of different tool types. Over 40 are recorded, produced by blading and chipping techniques. Arrow heads account for over 50% of the inventory. The remainder consist mainly of blades, pergoirs and diasper drill heads used for drilling steatite and perforating alabaster beads (105). The thousands of alabaster vessels are of unrestricted type; the largest diameter of the vessel corresponds to the rim. This might imply a precise limit of the technical means available to the local craftsmen. The greatest quantity of imported stones in Shahr-i Sokhta II/III were lapis lazuli and carnelian. Several thousand samples exist for each in the form of raw material and simple wasters: less than 10% represent finished objects. It is unlikely, with this dis? crepancy in number of wasters to finished goods that manufacture was for local consump? tion alone. Carnelian is found in abundance along the dry beds of the narrow riverine valley of the Hindu Kush. There is little evidence for the use of large carnelian objects at Shahr-i Sokhta II /III; it appears to have been used there as well as in Mesopotamia for the production of small beads and inlay works. Lapis lazuli is found in a very restricted area of the Sar-i Sang Valley in the Kerano-Munjan District of Afghanistan (106). The lapis lazuli appears in large chunks at Shahr-i Sokhta II/III, sometimes reaching a weight of 0.5 kg. The quartz and pyrite inclusion readily identify the Shahr-i Sokhta lapis as coming from the Badakhshan source. The best route westward from Badakhshan follows the Kabul, Arghandab and Hilmand River systems, avoiding the massive orographic system of the Hindu Kush. Resource areas for turquoise and chrysoprase are less easily defined. In historical times turquoise is well known as being indigenous to north-eastern Iran. Steatite is rare at Shahr-i Sokhta and characteristically used for compartmented-stamp seals (120 in number) and very rarely in carved vessels. Only two carved vessels have been found (figs. 32-40). It is entirely possible that steatite was traded from the Kerman area where its origins are documented. Wasters of steatite are not reported from Shahr-i Sokhta. It is interesting to note that compartmented-steatite seals are not found at Tepe Yahya or on other sites in south-eastern Iran. At Yahya IVB, steatite was the most extensively worked stone. There is evidence for steatite bowl production in the earlier periods at Yahya as well (fig. 95). A female figur (los) Piperno, ?Drill-heads and Boring techniques from Shahr-i Sokhta?, South Asian Archaeology, (Papers from the First International Conference of South Asian Archaeology held in the University of Cambridge), London, 1973. Ac cording to the diameter of the drill heads found, Dr Piperno supposes that this kind of tool could not be used for boring small lapis -and carnelian beads. (106) Herrmann, op. cit., pp. 22-27. 46</page><page sequence="105">ine of steatite represents this material's first appearance in Period VI (fig. 90). Several undecorated bowl fragments (fig. 95), bead and bracelet fragments of steatite appear throughout Period V. From VC we have also recovered 53 turquoise beads and 6 car nelian chunks. The only piece of lapis lazuli, a perforated, incised bead, was found in VB context (fig. 94) and represents one of the earliest examples of lapis recorded from the eastern Iranian Plateau ? earlier than any found at Shahr-i Sokhta. A few alabaster fragments were recovered from Yahya VA-IVB (fig. 93). The first evidence for the use of non-local stone materials is found in Period V at Yahya. There is no evidence for turquoise or carnelian wasters. There appears a con? sistent pattern from Yahya V to Yahya IVB in the local use, and limited quantity, of these important imports. There was a remarkable increase in both use and manufacture of steatite during Yahya VI-IVB. This evidence is indirectly confirmed by the discovery of four local steatite outcrops with evidence of mining, in the Ashin Mountains, 32 km. to the north of Tepe Yahya. Two of these outcrops have a rather limited steatite exposure, the other two are relatively large; one is a 35 m. long and 20 m. high outcrop with sub? stantial evidence of quarrying. Proto-literate Yahya IVC has only three bowl fragments of decorated steatite. The lowest architectural complex of IVB has two steatite seals and one square steatite dish with incised eagle found on the floors of the rooms (107). One of the seals is a round, button-back ,type readily paralleled in the seal corpus from the Persian Gulf (108). The other is a steatite cylinder seal depicting a procession of a winged female figure alter? nated with a male. The latter has vegetal matter sprouting from his body (109). A third seal is disc-shaped, perforated through the middle with two human left feet incised on one side and an unidentifiable insect incised on the other (110). The left-feet motif is paralleled on Persian Gulf-type seals. Also found in Yahya V are square serpentine and clay seals with simply incised geometric designs paralleled at Tal-i Bakun and the Bayat phase at Tepe Sabz (fig. 92) (U1). We turn now to a short review of the extensive evidence for local production of steatite at Tepe Yahya. To date we have recovered over 1000 pieces of worked, partially worked and unworked steatite from Period VI to the latest phases of IVA. A consid? erable amount of this material has already been published (112). The incised bowl designs incorporate a complex variety directly paralleling steatite from the island of Tarut, at Mari, Telloh, Khafajeh, Nippur, Agrab and Susa C to the west (113), at Kulli-damb in Baluchis (107) See Lamberg-Karlovsky, Kohl, op. cit., p. 17 for illustration.

The Mesopotamian steatite bowls from the above sites exhibit identical patterns to those at Tepe Yahya. In Mesopotamia these incised bowls date from E.D.II-III. Over fifty complete steatite bowls have been recently found in the graves of Shahdad. Steatite is rare in the follow? ing IVA Period at Yahya. A single piece, however, deserves comment. It is a broken plaque, some 8 in. in height with an entire architectural fagade carved on one side (fig. 136) (116). The motifs are all paralleled in Yahya IVB, suggesting either a continuity of production, or more likely in the face of IVA rarity of steatite, an heirloom retained by later inhabitants. The lithic industry at Tepe Yahya shows that a high degree of variability occurred in different periods. A preliminary analysis, as yet unconfirmed statistically, suggests that an important change occured in Period VB (117). A remarkable development, both quantitative and typological is evident from Period VC (less so in VB) to VA and IVC. After VB there was an immediate collapse in production. This is indicated not only by the de? creased number but the disappearance of certain lithic types. A revitalization is evident in Period IVB however, with the appearance of new types. The VI and VC liths are typical of neolithic production; a large number of blades, simple and retouched double burins, and less frequently observed, carinated end-scrapers and backed tools. Sickle blades are most common in Yahya VC. They are shaped of blade elements with little or no den? ticulated retouch and undenticulated-crescent elements with convex back. This lithic pro? duction shows important technological innovations. A neolithic influence is still evident in the burins, end-scrapers and in the scanty presence of backed convex sickle blades. There was a consistent increase in the use of denticulated sickle blades after Period VA and a decrease in concave-shaped blades characteristic of earlier periods. Concomitant with the decrease in backed tools is the first evidence of bifacial working on a limited number of arrow heads. Arrow heads are very rare in the lithic industry of Yahya IVC and IVA. This sharply contrasts with the evidence from Shahr-i Sokhta. The majority of the tools from Yahya were manufactured from flint, chert and quartz. Eleven pieces were made of obsidian. The change in lithic types from VA to IVC coincides with a change in the variety of domesticated animals from cattle in VI-VA to sheep/goat in IV. Within the past few years, two sites in the rich province of Kerman have provided us with significant evidence of a metallurgical industry. At Tal-i Iblis, in a settlement dated to the early 4th millennium, the excavator discovered several fragments of clay crucibles (118). When analysed these crucibles were shown to have incrustations of slag (114) For a review of the material from Ba? luchistan, Kulli, Mehi, Shahi-Tump, etc. see Dur? rani, op. cit.

This evidence suggests one of the earliest instances of copper smelting in the Near East. The excavations at Tepe Yahya have provided hundreds of pieces of copper-bronze implements. Analyses by R. Tylecote of the Period V metals show the production of implements from natural copper-arsenic ores (119). In subse? quent Period IV levels there is evidence for casting a copper-arsenic bronze alloy. Of great interest are the incredibly rich copper-bronze implements in the graves at Shahdad: dozens of shaft-hole axes, foot-long pins, buckets and cauldrons depicting scenes. This south-eastern Plateau region suggests both a technological diversity and a richness of resource. Trade and Interaction Spheres We shall now turn our discussion toward an analysis of the trade in various min? erals between the eastern Iranian Plateau, the Persian Gulf and Mesopotamia. It is obvious that the presence of considerable material in an area which is wholly lacking in that resource is evidence of systematic exchange. Mesopotamia was devoid of the resources we are deal? ing with, namely: semi-precious stones, such as lapis lazuli, carnelian, turquoise, steatite, alabaster and diorite; and metal ores. Mineral resources available in Mesopotamia were, in fact, limited to poor building stones, bituminous asphalt and shell from the Shatt el cArab. In contrast, the rich environment of the Greater Iranian Plateau extending east of the Zagros Mountains to the Pamirs and Karakum Desert provided many of the above named materials (map 3). The production areas of certain of these resources are still lacking a precise geographical location. Copper is found in the Zagros near Kashan, in Ker man, in northern Makran near Zahedan and in Oman (see note 104). The exact prove? nance of carnelian and turquoise is uncertain. Diorite is said to come from Oman and Ma? kran. We wTill contrast these two areas ? one of primary source and production, the other of primary demand, in an analysis of the process of trade. It is apparent that Mesopotamia was not alone in establishing a market system of redistribution in the 3rd millennium. For at the same time in southern Turkmenia, during Namazga II-V, and in south-eastern Iran at Yahya IVC-B, there was an intensification of economic activity in the production, distribution and trans-shipment of materials. There is evidence for the increased use of lapis lazuli from Namazga III times in Turkmenia (120), and later at Hissar III in the Gurgan Plain (121). Steatite vessels from the south-east Iranian settlement at Yahya and mineral ores from the Persian Gulf settlements further suggest this intensification of local redistribution systems. The archaeological evidence available for social integration in the resource-poor Meso (119) Cast copper arsenic bronzes of late 3rd millennium are known from the Khurab cemetery: see C.C.

There is a greater degree of social integration within the uniform po? litical and economic area of mid-3rd millennium Mesopotamia, where sites are hierarchi? cally related. This integration between sites is largely absent on the Iranian Plateau. Only with confined geographical regions, such as Sistan and Turkmenia does there appear to be evidence for any political, social or economic consolidation. It should be noted how? ever, that except for the later Indus Civilization, Mesopotamia represents a greater con? centration of settlements, population and wealth than the area east of Sumer (Chart III). It is well known that after the 4th millennium in Mesopotamia, the nature of political integration was based on the city-state (an economic structure based on a system of re? distribution and reciprocity). Yahya IVC, with its large building, tablets, seals, sealings, etc. provides an associated corpus of material identical to that which is identified with the rise of the city-state in Mesopotamia. We believe that such sites as Shahr-i Sokhta, Yahya, Namazga and Mundigak formed administrative centres within state organizations, at least by the first half of the 3rd millennium. Trade within Mesopotamia was built upon face to face relations within a culturally integrated area. Contact between sites, whether of a social, political or economic nature was Direct {A ??* B); there was no need for intermediaries. Within an integrated area the degree of distance between sites does not necessarily effect the opportunity for direct contact. In areas that are not culturally integrated, however, the greater the distance be? tween sites, the less the opportunity for such direct contacts. Indirect trade (A -&gt; B C -? D) may take place with A and D being unaware of each other. The picture which emerges in the early 3rd millennium suggests a maximum interchange within a strongly integrated southern Mesopotamia and a disparate nucleation of population in the culturally less integrated Iranian Plateau. We can profitably isolate the following mecha? nisms of trade between the Greater Iranian Plateau and Mesopotamia. Direct-Contact Trade: goods traded between sites A and B, within a single culture area and without interme? diaries to interrupt the trade between A and B. There is no archaeological evidence to support the existence of Direct-Contact Trade between Mesopotamia and the Iranian Pla? teau. Direct-Contact Trade would have required Sumerian colonies, situated on the Iranian Plateau, to ship materials back to Mesopotamia without intermediaries. A second mecha? nism is Indirect-Contact Trade. Materials available or manufactured in one area are passed on to another, ultimately reaching a given destination through random distribution or as a result of a concentrated demand of one area (122). The destination of the goods may or may not be known to the original producers. Materials move from A to B to C to D to E, etc. Lapis lazuli and steatite provide a reference for discussing the model of Indi? rect-Contact Trade between Mesopotamia and the Iranian Plateau. Lapis was mined in Badakhshan and passed from there to sites such as Shahr-i Sokhta. At Shahr-i Sokhta the (122) For a further discussion see C.C. Lamberg Karlovsky, ? Trade Mechanisms in Indus-Meso potamian Interrelations ?, JAOS, XCII, 1972, pp. 222-29. 50</page><page sequence="109">lapis was locally worked and consumed. However, the abundance of lapis at Shahr-i Sokh? ta suggests that it acted as an intermediary, trading lapis further to the west (123). The pres? ence of large pieces of unworked stone at Shahr-i Sokhta and Mesopotamia suggest that the lapis was shipped in a raw state. Shahr-i Sokhta acted as an intermediary in the trans? shipment of this material from Badakhshan to the demand centres of Mesopotamia. There is no evidence to suggest that Shahr-i Sokhta had Direct-Contact trade relations with Meso? potamia. The same model can be advanced for trade in steatite, with the difference that there is ample evidence for steatite vessels originally manufactured at Yahya. Identical and complex iconic motifs suggest that a shared ideology was manifest in the meaning of these motifs, distributed from Mari to Yahya and Tarut. The shared iconography on these ves? sels suggest an unexpected degree of ideographic integration over a very wide area. There is no comparable evidence, however, to support the idea that political, social or economic integration was also present. Thus, between Yahya and sites in Mesopotamia it would appear that there was greater integration, at least in the ideographic (religious?) realm, than existed between Shahr-i Sokhta and Mesopotamia. There is no evidence to suggest that Yahya's production and export of steatite was anything other than indirect ? through the Persian Gulf sites, Malyun, Susa, etc. With the important geographical position of Shahr-i Sokhta and the evidence for pro? duction as well as trans-shipment of materials desired in Mesopotamia, it is intriguing to pose the question: To what extent were the people of Shahr-i Sokhta aware of the Me sopotamian Civilization? It must be remembered that Shahr-i Sokhta has only minimal evidence of shared material types common to Mesopotamia, and only in its earliest period. The material culture of Shahr-i Sokhta was wholly unaffected by the Mesopotamian counter? parts. However, it seems unlikely that the mature urban centre of Shahr-i Sokhta would have been unaware of the highly integrated social and political order within contemporary Mesopotamia. It was Mesopotamia which provided the demand for so many of the mate? rial resources of the Iranian Plateau, and the people of Shahr-i Sokhta were most certainly aware of the existence of the biggest marketing area of the Near East in the early 3rd mil? lennium. Neither the urban development of Shahr-i Sokhta nor Yahya were dependent on Mesopotamia through a process of diffusion, but through an internal and interdependent urban process resulting from the exploitation of resources and population growth. We per? ceive the urban process and social integration within Mesopotamia and the Iranian Plateau as a single process, interdependent, but adapted to two different models: one in Mesopo? tamia resulting in a cohesive social integration within a resource-poor environment suitable only for farming; the other evidencing greater cultural disparity in a less uniform geo? graphical territory but rich in mineral resources. An economic and social dialectic provided the feedback which contributed toward the integration of Mesopotamia and the Iranian Pla? teau. In both regions, according to an increasing body of information, a substantial in (123) M. Tosi, ?

We perceive two different models operating within the two different areas: within southern Mesopotamia there was maximum expansion of settlements over the allu? vium and by the first half of the 3rd millennium, there is a basic cultural uniformity. At this time within the Greater Iranian Plateau there is evidence which suggests an in? creasing concentration of settlements around the limited arable land and specific resources. The situation is, however, not comparable to the Mesopotamian model, for in this area nucleation does not result in cultural integration. Within this expansive geographical area we can isolate a number of distinctive interaction spheres within which there is considerable integration. However, between these same nucleated interaction spheres there is little evi? dence for significant economic interchange; an excellent example being the contemporary production of local alabaster at Shahr-i Sokhta and local steatite at Yahya. At both sites there is poor evidence for the presence of the resource which the other had produced. Eco? nomic relations between these interaction spheres might have been at a minimum level, while all seemed to be independently providing resources for the principle demand centre - Mesopotamia. Although we are able to isolate which resources, and from which areas Me? sopotamia obtained these resources, we are unfortunately unable to isolate what Mesopo? tamia provided in return for the goods it obtained from the Iranian Plateau. This puzzling aspect leaves us without adequate explanation. Later Mesopotamian texts, however, state that perishable luxury items, i.e. textiles and cereals were traded in return for the goods obtained (124). The general archaeological evidence for the end of the 4th millennium supports the supposition that two main interaction spheres can be recognized on the Iranian Plateau: 1) the Jemdet Nasr which would include southern Mesopotamia (the Diyala, the Persian Gulf and southeastern Plateau extending to Yahya), and 2) the southern Turkmenian one extending south to the Hilmand and Quetta Valleys (map 1). Within each of these sphe? res there are material evidences which support a degree of cultural integration, i.e. certain types of shared ceramics, seals, architecture, figurines, etc. At a later stage, corresponding to the first half of the 3rd millennium, Mesopotamia shows a general stability in the geo? graphical distribution of its settlements. Meanwhile, there are substantial changes which took place in the cultural alignments of the urban centres on the Iranian Plateau (map 2). These changes appear in the tendency toward greater nucleation and disintegration of the earlier pattern of cultural interconnections. This tendency in Iran is apparent in the cultural isolation of geographical areas within the late 3rd and throughout the 2nd millennium. The collapse of urban life in the second half of the 3rd millennium implies a sharp change in the pattern of social organization and production systems, i.e. the quantitative output of the community and its relations to the large demand centres of Mesopotamia.

A continuous dialectic is established between pastoralists, agriculturalists, nomads, villagers and city dwellers. The social organization within the Iranian Plateau consists of the inter? action between the complementary sub-systems. Given the permeability and flexibility of these sub-systems, the history of the Iranian Plateau can be seen as one of nucleation and dissemination, integration and disintegration. /V it "k This paper results from the close collaboration of the two authors over the past sev? eral years. It takes its inspiration from a data base built up over five years of field research in two different parts of the Iranian Plateau. Both authors are working in poorly explored and little-understood areas on the Plateau. It has been our attempt not only to integrate our two sites but to indicate, in a preliminary fashion, the degree of cultural integration of the eastern Iranian Plateau with the areas of Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf. In so doing it is apparent that the extent of cultural integration and chronolog? ical contemporaneity of the urban process in the different areas provides a new view toward understanding the entire area. * The photographs are by Mrs F.
