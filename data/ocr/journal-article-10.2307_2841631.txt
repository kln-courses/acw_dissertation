THE noble volume containing the " Second Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institu- tion," contains several articles of great interest, admirably and profusely illustrated. The first is an instalnment of Mr. Frank (Cushing's report on the Zuinis, among whom he has lived for several years, during which time he has not only become a member of the community by adoption, but has also been admitted to the " Priesthood of the Bow." This has given him exceptional oppor- tunities of examining into the nature of their beliefs, and of describing the peculiar customs and ceremonies connected there- with; and the account he here gives of their philosophy, and that which may be termed their animistic fetichism, cannot fail to interest all students of anthropology; and especially of that branch of the science which treats of the development of religion. The myths of the Zufiis are embodied in a long unwritten epic, publicly recited every four years, but only to the priests, and Mr. Cushing, although admitted to the priesthood, was only per- mitted to listen to one-fourth of it in 1881, the date of the last recitation. 'Their worship appears to be directed not only to sun, moon, stars, and all the forces of Nature, but to every natural object, animate and inanimate, which are all supposed to be con- nected together in one system of relationship, of which man is the centre. "In just so far as an organism, actual or imaginary, resembles that of man, is it believed to be related to him and correspondingly mortal; in just so far as it is mysterious, is it considered removed from him, further advanced, powerful, and immortal. It thus happens that the animals, because alike mortal and endowed with similar physical functions and organs, are con- sidered more nearly related to man than are the gods; more nearly related to the gods than is man, because more mysterious, and characterized by specific instincts and powers which man does not possess." They have no general term for God, but there are many anthropomorphic, monstrous and elemental beings, godlike in at- tributes, known as the "finishers or makers of the paths (of our lives)4," whilst the most superior of all is called "Holder of the paths (of our lives)." Their fetiches are either natural formns resembling prey-animals, or carvings of great antiquity representing these animals, which are regarded as the animals themselves, turned into</page><page sequence="2">Anthropologyical iifscellanea. 397 stone by two children of the sun-father, using as their weapons the rainbow and the lightning; hence these fetiches are supposed to possess magic power over the game. Chief among these are images of the mountain lion, bear, badger, wolf, eagle, and mole, presiding over north, west, south, east, the Above and the Below. Fetiches of these prey-gods, generally adorned with beads and a flint arrow head, are kept with great care and brought out on a special day for worship; one is lent to a party of bunters, and is carefully carried in a crescent-shaped bag, taken out and addressed in prayer, dipped in the blood of the slaughtered animal, and restored to the keeper at the end of the expedition. In addition to these prey-god fetiches, the priesthood of the Bow possesses a god in human form, called the " Knife-feathered monster," which is depicted on their shield, and is strongly suggestive of Egyptian or Assyrian art. As Mr. Cushing has returned to New Mexico, we may hope for further notices of this interesting people, whose works of art, with those of neighbouring tribes in New Mexico and Arizona, are illustrated in the last article of the volume before us, which is a " Catalogue of a Collection obtained from the Indians in 1879, by James Stephenson." Of these, some are ancient, obtained fromn ruined ppueblos, and some are modern. Most of the pottery, in colour, form, and ornamentation, bears a strong resemblance to early Greek, Etruscan, and Peruvian ware, as also to that from Hissarlik; but there are some forms which seem peculiar to the region, especially the clay baskets and ladles. The stone mauls and hammers appear to be precisely like the European, and there is a weapon fashioned like a boomerang, used in hunting rabbits. Mrs. Erminie Smith's article on the " Myths of the Iroquois" consists of a series of tales whereby these Indians explain various natural phenomena, in which, as in the folk-lore of miost nations, giants and pigmies play an important part, bat the "Great Heads" of these tales seem to be an original conception; they are ap- parently both good and evil, "with ever-watchful eyes, and long hair, which serves them as wings to bear them on missions of mercy or of destruction." Mr. Henshaw's paper on "Animal Carvings from Mounds of the Mississippi Valley," is written to prove that Squier and Davis, Wilson and other writers have been mistaken in their estimate of the art of the mound butilders, and in supposing that such animals as the manatee, toucan, &amp;c., &amp;c., are represented among their carvings; nevertheless, I believe that the majority of readers will be inclined to adhere to the opinion of the older writers, and will certainly see more likeness to the toucan, in the carving thus designated by Squier and Davis, than to the ibis as suggested by Mr. Henshaw, whilst they will hardly be likely to agree with him in regarding all the human heads as caricatures of the American Indian phvsiognomy. A paper on "Navajo Silversmiths," by Dr. Washington Matthews, U.S.A., is an interesting account of the method of work and tools employed by these clever artificers.</page><page sequence="3">398 Anthropological Mliscellanea. But the article which will attract the greatest amount of atten- tion, is that upon " Art in Shell of the Ancient Americans," by William H. Holmes. In this beautif ally illustrated article we find shells of various kinds applied to so many uses, that we are tempted to add an age of shell to those of stone and metal on the American continent. The specimens figured and described come from mounds in all parts, and represent. food and drinking vessels, spoons, pins, fish- hooks, agricultural implements, war-clabs, celts, &amp;c., as well as beads and other ornaments, from plain pendants to elaborately carved gorgets. The carvings on these gorgets are varied from a simple cross, to wonderfully designed and artistically executed figures, representing geometrical patterns, birds, the rattlesnake, spiders, and the human form, often curiously conventionalized: and in come cases spirited designs of combats, &amp;c., the singular part in which is, that they are almost identical with carvings from Mexico and Nicaragua, although found in Tennessee; the mounds from this latter state seem to have furnished the majority of these works in shell, although some are from Missouri, Alabama, Georgia, and New York. Among the most curious of the finds are a number of faces rudely pourtrayed, and suipposed to be masks; these also are chiefly from Tennessee, but they have been found in Klentucky, Virginia, Illinois, Missouri and Arkansas. The shell chiefly used for these ornaments is Busycon perversum, and its presence so far inland is a proof of long continued intercourse between the mound builders and the people dwelling on the coast whence these shells were obtained. Another very interesting part of this article describes the mana- facture and use of wampum, giving the mode of making the beads from the inner whorl of the shell, and the history of many famous wampum belts. It may be safely affirmed that the volume before us, with its pre- decessor, will prove a mine of wealth to students of American archaeology, and it is greatly to be regretted that our own scientific societies, being unaided by government, are unable to rival the Smithsonian Institution in their publications, especially in the matter of illustrations, which are so valuable to students.
