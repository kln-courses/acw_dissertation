<plain_text><page sequence="1">BRONSON ALCOTT'S "JOURNAL FOR 1838" (PART TWO) Larry A. Carlson T SECOND AND CONCLUDING PART of this edition of Bronson Alcott's "Journal for 1838" covers the months of June through December.' For Alcott this was a time of great disappointment and soul-searching. Within a one-week period at the end of June he suffered the double blow of finally having to close the Temple School and reluctantly accepting Emerson's advice that "Psyche" was not publishable. As he had begun doing in the spring, Alcott continued considering other ways of making a living and spreading his ideas. Throughout all the anguished weighing of options and meditating on his past experiences and future plans, he railed at the philistinism of the age and saw himself as a martyr to the cause of enlightened, noble ideas about human culture in a crass, materialistic society. The record of the psychological, moral, and spiritual development of his youngest child, Elizabeth, "Psyche" had evolved from earlier observations he had made on his two oldest children, Anna and Louisa May. Even after several extensive revisions undertaken with the guidance of Emerson, who had prom- ised to publish it at his own risk, the manuscript still suffered from abstractness, stylistic mannerisms, verboseness, and what Emerson told Alcott was "a want of unity of design."2 For his part Emerson found the process painful: his best friend simply could not embody ideas in concrete form and in a style that was at once direct and felicitous. In a letter to Margaret Fuller composed on the same day he wrote Alcott that "Psyche" should not be published, Emerson described his "faithful criticism" of the manuscript as "a very irksome piece of work."3 Alcott abandoned the book altogether, believing that he could best communicate his ideas and beliefs through action rather than the written word. "Why should I court the public," he noted in his journal, "but to stagger its faith, and belie my own ideas. I deem silence, living deeds, a fairer style of publication." 123</page><page sequence="2">124 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 Difficult to accept too was closing the Temple School, which he had operated since the fall of 1834. The steady withdrawal of patronage caused by the controversy over his Conversations with Children on the Gospels (1836-37) finally took its toll. Even two of his long-time friends had distanced themselves from the school: the Reverend William Ellery Channing, who had helped gather students for Alcott at the beginning of the experiment, had come to regard his friend's ideas as heretical; and Elizabeth Palmer Peabody, who had assisted Alcott in the classroom since the school's opening, had quit just before the Conversations was published, correctly sensing the scandal that would follow. His ego deflated when at last the doors were closed at the end of June, Alcott was also several thousand dollars in debt. In midsummer he contemplated several courses of action, most of which he rejected because they either did not suit his interests or provide sufficient money to support his family. Neither a proposed Mission of Education to Parents and Children in Boston nor a Ministry at Large in Louisville appealed to him, the former because it would not pay enough. The offer from Louisville was not as difficult to turn down even though it came from his old friend James Freeman Clarke, who was editing the Western Messenger, a Transcendentalist journal in the West. Boston was home for Alcott: he simply could not imagine himself away from family and friends like Emerson. Easiest of all for Alcott to exclude from his list of possible jobs was manual labor. He continued to see himself as a thinker, an intellectual whose ideas could reshape society; manual labor would leave him little time for thought. Orpheus he would be, but not Orpheus at the plow. The two plans that he did pursue were running a school at his house, on Beach Street, and conducting conversations for adults in the towns and villages outside of Boston. Alcott's "School for Mental and Moral Culture," which opened on 1 October, was more modest in scope and goals than the Temple School. He taught both sexes, from four to twelve (most were under ten), and charged eight dollars per term for a regular course of study, twelve for students wishing to learn Latin and French. He enrolled fifteen pupils, far fewer than the all-time high of over forty who were under his charge at the Temple School. Alcott's various journal entries about the Beach Street School are striking in their relative absence of the lofty aspirations that characterized those written about the Temple School. But even the modest plans he had for the new school were eventually thwarted when the next year he refused to dismiss an African- American student he had admitted and again suffered the inevitable conse- quences of a withdrawal of patronage. When he closed the doors in June 1839, he gave up his mission of teaching children. He concluded that until adults were better informed about educational reform his work with children would be destined to failure.4</page><page sequence="3">Bronson Alcott's "Journal for 1838" 125 Even as he set about teaching young people at his Beach Street home, Alcott began a "ministry of talking" in Lexington and Hingham. These conversations, addressed to adults, were a mixture of informal discussions and "high colloquy" on subjects centering on self-culture. The twelve conversations at Lexington, arranged with the help of his friend John Sullivan Dwight, who was preaching there, included such topics as "Elements of Human Nature," "Intellectual Relations of Soul," and "Law of Culture." Nearly as many as fifty people came to his talks at Lexington. Alcott's dozen conversations at Hingham, arranged by other friends, Charles Brooks and Anna Q. Thaxter, were almost as well attended and included the same sort of intellectual fare. Alcott apparently became a kind of celebrity bringing culture out of Boston to these small towns. The Reverend Increase S. Smith of Hingham, writing to Caroline Weston, waxed enthusiastically about these conversations: "We are soaring here once a week in the seventh heaven of Transcendentalism with Mr. Alcott. He makes quite a talk here just now. I enjoy his conversations very much, and agree with him too in very many of his views.""5 However gratifying these conversations were in nourishing Alcott's ego, they were not very financially successful: he received thirty-six dollars for his efforts at Hingham, thirty for the talks at Lexington. Still, though, he believed that he had found a suitable forum for his ideas and went ahead with plans to begin holding conversations in Lynn in January 1839. Also during the fall Alcott held a series of Monday evening conversations with the parents of his new pupils and Friday evening discussions with friends. Those attending the latter included such Transcendentalists and reformers as Emerson, Dwight, William Lloyd Garrison, William Russell, Theodore Parker, and Edward Palmer, the last named having achieved notoriety by refusing to use money. Alcott hoped that this circle of radicals would grow and help make his house "Headquarters of all Heresies." Whatever doubts "Psyche" may have raised about Alcott's ability with the pen, Emerson had nothing but praise for his friend's talents as a talker in the great age of talk: "Alcott is the only majestic converser I now meet. He gives me leave to be, more than all the others."6 Alcott also continued to take advantage of the many public and private opportunities that the Boston area provided for intellectual stimulation and growth. He had yet another phrenological analysis, this time by one of the Fowler brothers, and heard George Combe lecture on the fad and pseudoscience of phrenology. He attended the annual meeting of the American Institute of Instruction, taught Sunday School in Lexington, and shared his ideas about children with Sunday School teachers in Scituate and New Bedford. He met the Plymouth Association of Ministers and later, at Emerson's, the Cam- bridge Association. He participated in the anti-slavery activities of the New England Peace Convention and signed the Declaration of Sentiments. He</page><page sequence="4">126 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 heard Charles Follen's lectures on "Pantheism and the Personality of the Deity" and attended Emerson's series on "Human Life." And, as usual, he remained a prominent figure in the Transcendental Club; read widely; and maintained a large circle of interesting friends-"the noblest, best, most gifted" of the era- ranging from humble artisans and laborers to the well-educated listed above as well as such other intellectuals as Sarah Alden Ripley, Margaret Fuller, and Jones Very, an eccentric poet recently released from a mental hospital after having fallen prey to religious hallucinations. The image of Alcott that ultimately emerges from his "Journal for 1838" is that of a deeply frustrated reformer at a crossroads in his life and career. Uncharacteristically silent in his journal upon his reaching his birthday-he turned thirty-nine on 29 November-Alcott clearly felt that the year had been one more of losses than triumphs. As was his wont he measured his accomplish- ments and failures against those of his fellow Transcendentalists and reformers, especially Emerson. That he compared the obloquy heaped upon him because of the Conversations to be of the same sort that Emerson endured after delivering his Divinity School Address, on 15 July, speaks volumes about how he saw himself as an unappreciated seer unjustly penalized for speaking the truth about human culture and advancing a more enlightened view of society than would be accepted at the time. In his final journal entry for the year, he seemed to find refuge and strength in his past glories: "I have lived:-lived at times, days, hours, minutes, during the passage of this vale around the orb of day. I have had light, heat, sight, for brief and fitful moments; and memory yet reverts to these living hours wherein I rose from the sepulchres of sense, and was in God." He would not have this sense of being "in God" for some time to come.</page><page sequence="5">Bronson Alcott's "Journal for 1838" 127 [259] June. Week XXIII [3-9 June] L. Ministry of Education. My Book is off my hands, for the present.' My school makes small demands upon my time, and faculties. I inquire, what shall now yield occasion for worthy [260] exercise of my gifts. And await answer. But the future scarce vouchsafes intelligible answer. I hear, however, of an effort now in progress to ensure me the means of devoting myself to a Ministry of Education to the Poor of this city; and this without proscribing means of action, but leaving the whole to my own choice.8 I am to gather parents and children together, and teach, as I please.-Beside this, I recd. a communication from a friend, who has a similar work for me to do, in one of our western cities. I await particulars concerning these plans of action. The letter, recd. several days since, besides other interesting matters, contains the following: [261] "We have but four hundred dollars in prospect for the mission, but I think if Mr Alcott would agree to take that, and as much more as we could raise here; and be Missionary a part of his time, and keep school the other part, I could get him eight or ten scholars here at once. If he will say that he will come out, I will fall to work engaging scholars for him. Then he could keep school, and, in the afternoon walk about, and see the poor folks, and, on Sunday, preach to the children, and whosoever else we could muster. x xx x I should like to have him amazingly, and should think it a great thing; but I am afraid he would miss many things that he loves." &amp;c.9 [262] I shall, of course, prefer a ministry of this sort, in Boston, to any other place. If the proposition leave me free to act, and supply means for corporeal needs, I shall gladly enter upon such labour. I can compass my ends therein. Almost all that I would do, may find organ thereby. I can teach the doctrines of Human Culture. A school for the children during the week: Lectures for parents on Sunday: classes of young people, as I please. I can demonstrate principles thereby. I can reveal the Idea of which I am minister. Let such means be put into my hands, and I will teach and preach the Gospel that the age needs. My ministry shall become the foundation of a new and living culture; cleansing and exalting the schools, and the churches. [263] June Weeks XXIV-XXV [10-23 June] LI. Waiting. Two weeks, with short interlude of the intellectual life. This seems a crisis in my external being. I am lying in wait for the guidance of providence-going to and [264] from school; dwelling on the measure by which I should accomplish my purpose by means of the new form of action that devolves on me upon entering upon my ministry of</page><page sequence="6">128 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 education in this city: with the aids and hindrances that I should, doubtless, meet with in its prosecutions. Beside these topics of thought, the disposition of my family, health of my companion, &amp;c. were matters of consideration.'1 Rev. Mr Channing and Dwight, made me a pleasant visit." [265] June. Week XXVI. [24-30 June] LII. I withold Psyche. Emerson returned my MS. with his criticisms thereon. He points out the defects of the book; and seems disposed to have [265] me withold it from publication. I judge the counsel wise. And feel inclined, at present, to lay it aside, giving myself, the rather, to action, whereby I shall chance to ripen my faculties, and enrich my genius, for worthier composition, at some future day. Why should I court the public, but to stagger its faith, and belie my own ideas. I deem silence, living, deeds, a fairer style of publication. And my ministry will, I hope, favor such purpose. For the present, then, I will withold these papers. I will act; and let thinking spring more directly from deeds. I closed my school, with sadness-with gladness-mixed emotions. [267] LIII. Close my School at the Temple. I closed my School, in anticipation of entering soon upon my ministry of education, wherein I hope to demonstrate the principles of human culture in a popular form. I shall have more freedom of action, and stand in a fairer relation to the great interests of culture, by the position which I am now to take, than I have heretofore. My mode of action is yet to be determined. It is now four years since I resumed my labours of instruction in Boston, having been absent, as many; engaged [268] in teaching in Pennsylvania, with my friend, Wm. Russell." My labours here have not been fruitless, though by no means popular. They have drawn the attention of some of the finest minds amongst us, to the subject of human culture, and the institutions of education have been, to some degree, modifyed thereby. Abroad, also, they have been made a subject of inquiry. From England, France, and Germany, information has been sought, and my Books have been forwarded in answer.'3 But it is yet quite too early for the fruits of my labours to &lt;be&gt; ripen and be garnered. The seed sown, must find genial soil, fair sky, and careful nurture, ere the harvest can come in. Such time shall come. The future [269] shall bear witness to the truth of those principles which I espouse, and have set forth, in part, in my enterprize in this city. My</page><page sequence="7">Bronson Alcott's "Journal for 1838" 129 Books must in time find readers, and my methods be adopted as models of culture, both in domestic, and public instruction, in the Sunday School, and the church. I shall do somewhat by way of renovating existing forms of education. Whatsoever is good shall be accepted. The wants of the age, shall at last, find means of supply in the principles and methods of which I am the herald, in this country, especially as regards the culture of the spiritual instincts and faculties. [270] I insert, in this place, the receipts of my school for the four years under consider- ation: Receipts of 1834-5 $1794.00 " 1835-6 " 1649.00 1836-7 "1395.00 1837-8 " 549.00 Receipts for 4 years 5387.00 But my expenditures have exceeded, by $5000, the receipts of this period, including the support of my family, and the publishing of the "Conversations on the Gospels." [271] July. Weeks XXVII[-]XXVIII. [1-14 July] LIV. Household. I spent this time chiefly with my family, correcting the faults of my children, and seeking to to put my household in order. Mrs. Alcott's health is quite indifferent. [272] She cannot aid me, as she would in the important trusts of domestic culture. Our children suffer in consequence. But the wise compensations of nature, have, as on all the relations of life, come in to lend assistance. The children get self-resource, and self-dependence. I trust the days are coming when we shall be better able to do what the claiming natures of our little ones need, for their growth in intellectual and moral beauty. [273] July. Week XXIX. [15-21 July] LV. Mrs Alcott's Visit to Scituate. Mrs Alcott left Cottage Place, with one of the children, for Scituate, to spend a few weeks with her brother, [274] Revd. S. J. May, hoping to recruit her wasted powers by the refreshing agencies of nature. I spent this time chiefly with my children, Anna and Elizabeth.14</page><page sequence="8">130 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 I read, however, Emerson's Edition of Carlyle's Miscellanies, which came out at this time.'5 And refreshing reading it was, amidst the inane with which the age abounds. Most of these admirable papers I had read before. But I perused them with a new and grateful delight. Carlyle, is, of all modern English writers, most suggestive. His page is rich. He says more than any other writer, yet provokes to yet deeper and nobler thought. Two other volumes are to follow the two now issued. [275] July. Week XXX. [22-28 July] LVI. Stay in Scituate. I went to Scituate with the remainder of my family, during this week, intending to spend some time in the country. We found boarding and lodging with Deacon James, a plain farmer, residing near Mr. Mays.'16 [276] I visited Rev Mr. Brooks and Miss Thaxter at Hingham, with whom I had much conversation, chiefly in relation to my present condition, and future purposes.17 Mr Brooks has been engaged in lecturing on Education throughout the State; and is desirous of introducing the Prussian System into our common schools. He has corre- sponded with M. Cousin of France, and recommends his views of education to the people of N. England. Through him, I recd a pamphlet from Cousin, on The School for the instruction of the Poor at Amsterdam. I trust that he will write me, when he shall have read the Books which I sent him awhile since.'8 [277] I had some conversation with Brooks, and am assured from his tone and manner, that, not only himself, but others now engaged in the improvement of education amongst us, are quite ready to make use of my views and methods, without acknowledgement. But there shall be justice done me in the end. I feel honoured that men deem my views worthy of mention, and circulate them, though in their own name; they cannot bereave me of &lt;the&gt; creditt.l &lt;which is mine, whether much or little.&gt; TForl, &lt;But yet, all&gt; all truth is impersonal: it belongs to God; let no man claim property in it. The individual merit is in greater or less insight, in clearer or earlier revelation thereof, to the eye of others. [278] The present movement in education, of whom Mr Brooks, and Mr Mann, are the chief promoters, is, in every respect, popular.19 It is adapted to the present and immedi- ate wants of the people. It is not radical in its nature. It cannot long satisfy. The deeper needs of the soul will ere long cry aloud, and must be supplied. I wait in faith and patience, assured that so far as I have insight into the soul, and my methods are faithful to the laws of its action, shall my doctrines be received; and the present movement be herald of my word. [279] August. Week XXXI-II[-]III [29 July-18 August]</page><page sequence="9">Bronson Alcott's "Journal for 1838" 131 LVII. Doings while in Scituate During this period, I note the following particulars, as worthy a place in my diary:- [280] 1. Visit Rev Mr Sewall-Had some conversation with him on intellectual and moral topics. His mind is too conventional, his piety too feeble, owing to the predomi- nance of ill health, and the necessary dependance to which he has been subjected, to give him sympathy with my own views. I fear that I gave him pain rather than pleasure by the utterance of them.20 2. I met the S[unday] S[chool] Teachers on two occasions, for conversation. I believe these interviews were of service, by way of quickening thought on spiritual subjects. I also addressed the Sunday School in two instances, giving the children a talk, and a reading. [281] 3. I met the Association of Ministers for Plymouth County, at D[r]. Kendall's in Plymouth.2' Here I gave utterance to my views on the nature and evidences of Christian- ity, and was listened to with respect. My doctrine was not wholly cast aside. Here I met some friends. 4. I rode to New-Bedford, with Rev. Mr May, and passed Sunday in that place. Here I met a circle of S[unday] S[chool] Teachers, and discussed high moral questions. I saw Rev Messrs Peabody and Morrison, and other friends residing in N-Bedford22--I had a glimpse of the corrupt aristocracy which predominates in that place. [282] After an absence of nearly four weeks, I returned with my family to Cottage Place, myself and all members thereof quite refreshed by our stay. I now await the call of my instincts, to go forth, upon some labour worthy of the mission upon which I am sent. As yet I know not what I am to do. The Mission of Education to the City languishes. But slender contributions have been made to it. I am without employment. A few weeks must give me work, or my family will want. [283] August. Week XXXIV. [19-25 August] LVIII. American Institute of Instruction. I passed three days, of this week, at Lowell, in attendance on the doings of the American Institute of Instruction. Each year I leave the sittings of this body, feeling that I will not again attend, so little is attempted, so little is [284] done, for the real interests of human culture. I feel solitary, alone, amidst my fellows. I witness much noise, hear many commonplaces; my colleagues are garralous with measures, yet all seem quite wide of the things to be done. Instruction, instead of &lt;management&gt; education; management, instead of influence; forms, instead of principles, are mooted, with much display of word and gesture; yet nothing vital is effected.</page><page sequence="10">132 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 But, now and then, TI seel a man dreaming of the things needful. T&amp; doing a deed worthy of notel. These are the signs of hope. This Association is the work of a few Boston Teachers, and has no claim whatever to the name of the American Institute.23 [285] By means of its anniversaries, a few of the Boston School masters, parade from year to year, such crude views of instruction as they possess, in lectures and resolutions, before such audiance as they shall chance to gather, and collect materials, in this wise, for a volume of abstract essays on education; while the vital wants of the people remain unasked, unprovided, for. The people are not questioned in earnest. The time approaches when the true friends of human culture shall go forth amidst the people, and communing with them, face to face, shall reveal their very needs, and devise fit means for their sustenance. As yet, the facts of the case are not collected as data of action. I wish I could take my staff, and visit the fire sides, [286] school houses, altars, of the land, and do what my heart prompts me to do, for the general quickening of the common mind on this great topic. A simpler mode of action shall alone regenerate and revise opinion amongst us, as the means of establishing the institutions we demand. Associations, conventions, lectures, will not suffice. We must have talk, free communion, one with the other. In this, is our hope. I await the hour for such action. I must go forth, or others, in like spirit, amidst the people. But now are my feet stayed; and hands folded, for lack of substance wher[e]with to sustain myself and family. [287] August. Week XXXV. [26 August-1 September] LIX. Enumeration of Plans. I lie in wait for some thing to which I shall turn my faculties. Various plans of action suggest themselves, from time to time; as yet I am unable to enter upon [288] none. I enumerate the most important. 1. The Mission of Education to Parents and Children.-This plan meets with slender support as yet. But a little more than $400 has been contributed to set it in operation, and this sum, chiefly, by a few of my personal friends. I doubt its feasibility at present. My family cannot derive support from it. Time may add means, and I may be encouraged to enter upon it. 2. A Day School at the South of the City. Some of my friends, in this vicinity, are making exertions to obtain pupils for such an enterprize. I may be induced to enter upon it; although I do not see facilities offered thereby to the furtherance of my great ends, beyond present support.24</page><page sequence="11">Bronson Alcott's "Journalfor 1838" 133 [289] 3. Travelling throughout the towns and villages ?(or, in some modified form, in the city)l conversing, lecturing, and offering samples of instruction, T&amp; developing the principles4 of human culture. Here, the means of support for my family, seem to be denied. 4. Accepting the call at Louisville[,] Ky. as missionary and teacher in that place. I prefer to reside and do my work in the East. Here is my arena for action. 5. Entering some manual or mechanical occupation as a means of livelihood, devoting my evenings and Sundays to unfolding my views, in the composition of works for the press. Here I must necessarily devote an unequal portion of time to mere manual labour, reserving small time for thought or composition. [290] My course of procedure is not yet plain to me. I pine for action. I mourn, as &lt;friend&gt; for a loved, yet departed friend-for the opportunity of which I was so rudely bereft, as in my enterprize while in no[.] 7 in the Temple-yet do I look forward, the rather, to the things that are yet awaiting my faculties, than grieve unduly at the recollection of those now past. I shall honour my mission in due season. The age shall grow into my Idea, and then shall I have &lt;work,&gt; sympathy, influence, joy, in the exercise of my gifts, and Deeds shall be the Body and Countenance of Ideas, now invisible, impalpable, to the many. Hope-Faith! I draw on your o[v]erflowing urns! [291] September. Week XXXVI. [2-8 September] LX. Visit of Revd. Ezekiel Rich. Mr. Rich and daughter, from Troy[,] N. H. called on me, and spent a night at my house, during this week. I had seen him at Lowell, during the sittings of the Institute of Instruction, [292] before which he delivered an impressive lecture, on self supporting manual Labour schools. He is a remarkable man. A plain, simple, strong-minded, free, soul; educated a minister, and still a preacher; devoted to the improvement of human nature, by means of improved methods of culture. He is at present the founder of an institution, for carrying his views into operation, into which he receives orphans, chiefly, who, by means of their own labour, defray the expenses of a solid education, and are to be tra[i]ned into efficient members of the community. He is an earnest honest, man. His daugher, educated by his means, or, in accordance with his principles, [is] an energetic intelligent person; now 14 years of age, with the [293] faculty, bodily and mental, of most women of mature years. Mr. R's plans are iminently practical. Agriculture forms their basis. And he would train the mind amidst, and by, the scenes and occupations in which life is to be passed. He is a hardy son of nature, and seems raised up, by the needs of this age and people, to give a system of economical culture, suited to condition of the laboring classes.</page><page sequence="12">134 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 It is refreshing to meet with such samples of God's attributes, amidst the vulgar commonplaces of life. How seldom one meets with a genuine human being! All men are spoiled. I joy in finding such. I feel all my faith in the good [294] soul, quickened into more vivid life and reality. The godhead doth never leave himself without visible witness&lt;, in any age, of his own divinity&gt;, in the souls of the true, the upright, the original men, who amidst hindrance, persecution, wrong, and all sacrifices, reveal his face to the world! Mr Rich has met with great opposition. His plans have been misapprehended; but he has undoubted faith in his Idea, and whatsoever of truth he has seen, he will, I doubt not, ultimately make plain to the world. Such men as this, do the great things on the Earth.25 [295] LXI. Phrenological Analysis. While staying at Scituate, I rode over to Hingham to visit Mr Brooks and Miss Thaxter. Finding Mr Fowler there, a practical phrenologist, from N. York, I submitted myself to his examination. The following is the result; &lt;of his examination,&gt; differing, in some particulars, from the analysis both of Jones and Fletcher, whose reports are preserved on the pages of my Journals.26 I have slender faith in the doctrines of Phrenology as now current. It has foundation in our nature; but is [296] not yet surveyed in all its relations. The whole corporeal man is included in it; and, taken as a whole, the body is a type of the soul.

[298]]I omit his inference of character from organization; as, from the nature of the case, all such inferences must be more or less devoid of accuracy. There is much of quackery in this. Yet such characters are what the multitude ask; and from them the practcial phrenologist derives his support, rather than the scientific report of organs. [299] September. Week XXXVII. [9-15 September] Visit at Concord. I rode to Concord and passed two days with Emerson. Mr. Dwight and Channing accompanied me. During this time the Association of Ministers met at Emersons, and discussed, among other topics, [300] that of "Inspiration." But little, however, was said. The speakers, generally, were devoid of theory on this topic. Their veiws were tradi- tional, having no ground in the soul. Emerson, Francis, Stetson, Dwight, Parker, (mem- bers of the Symposeum) had theories of their own. Others, as Field, Barry, Swett, Newell, Muzzy, Frost, were wedded to tradition.27 This topic derives a greater importance at this time, from several causes. The doctrines of popular theology, are now under discussion. They do no satisfy the insight of thinkers among us.-Emerson lately, in an address before the students of Divinity Hall, gave utterance to some views of a freer, bolder, character, at which some of the con- [301]servatives raised a loud outcry; and the public prints were filled with the charge of "Atheism," "German theology[?]" &amp;c. raising quite a panic amongst the advocates of scholastic theology.28 I imagine the time has come when the cardinal topics of theology must be discussed. The grounds of human faith must be set forth in a fairer light. The soul must be explored in all its deep and mystic facts, and theology assume the form of a science, no longer resting on the dead letter of traditions. Into this discussion, I enter with hope. New light</page><page sequence="14">136 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 is to be shed over the whole doctrine of the soul. The best minds amongst us are already intent on such work. [302] An attempt will be made to heap obloquy on the names of those who advocate nobler views views. Many will seek to hide themselves; but now, all true men &lt;will&gt; Tmusti- come forward, and stand up in defence of of truth.-I deem my own labours as heralds of this hour. I am suffering from the words that I have uttered. I am almost bereft of a position in society. My books are Tmadel a scandal to my name. The same course will be pursued with Emerson. He will be made to suffer reproach. He is already condemned. But there are noble souls, a few, in our midst, and these, brave and reverent, shall win the day. I take the glory and the shame with such. [303] September. Week XXXVIII. [16-22 September] LXIII. Visit Lexington and Waltham. I rode to Lexington on Sunday morning [16 September], of this week; and after addressing the children of the S[unday] School, accompanied Mr. Dwight to Waltham, where he preached. We visited Mrs. Ripley, and dined with her, having much agreeable conversation on high topics. I [304] enjoyed her conversation very much. She is a person of remarkable acquirements, and fine powers. Her society is sought by men of learning and genius. She brings the best faculties of the day about her. Scholars frequent her dwelling. She has a few pupils at all times under her care.29 Mr Dwight preached for Rev. Mr. Ripley; His descourse was on the doctrine of living-a sensible essay. In the evening, I met, at Lexington, a large circle of persons, chiefly, to the consider- ation of the subject of "Free-Will." Mr. Dwight, with a few others joined in the conversation. All present seemed [305] interested in the discussion. I was invited to visit them again. This I purpose to do.-I intend to hold courses of conversations, in several of the adjacent towns, during the coming autumn and winter, on the "theory and practice of Self-Culture." This I can do, I fancy, to advantage both to myself, and those who may patronize such purpose. Whatever shall be my employment in the city, during the day, I can meet 'evening, circles in the villages, and discuss with them the doctrines of culture. Parents, teachers, youth, would enjoy such meetings. I deem this, as the most direct and ready means of quickening the mind of the people. I should gather all the best minds in the villages, and guide their thoughts to the worthiest topics. This is to be my way, I think, of publishing myself. [306] I purpose giving such courses in Hingham, Medford, Watertown, Lynn. Wherever there are a few free, earnest, minds I will go. Beside such courses in the adjacent towns, I mean to draw circles of similar character, and to like end, in the city. There are those, who would enjoy such manner of spending</page><page sequence="15">Bronson Alcott's "Journalfor 1838" 137 an evening weekly. These I intend to meet at my own house. I shall begin soon. Arrangements are &lt;soon to be&gt; made, by which such intention shall be tested. [307] LXIV. Peace Convention. I attended a Convention of the friends of Non Resistance, held at the Marlborough Chapel, on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, of this week. There was much discussion of the principles of Non Resistance. A Declaration of Sentiments was adopted, by a few of the members, in which these principles were carried into their remote consequences. To this declaration I gave my name, as the sentiments were those which I had long advocated, and upon which my life has long been grounded. I took this occasion to give utterance to my views.30 [308] But few of the members of this convention were prepared to carry these principles into act. The sacrifice demanded thereby was too great. The faith in moral power implied, was greater than they could give. Force, appeals to the fears, passions, interests of men, were deemed more potent. The might of meekness, the glory of self-sacrifice, overcoming evil with good, these were doctrines in which the many could not confide their reputation, interests, life. But a few were strong. And these gave evidence of their faith by utterance of their views. In these few I have hope. Though their modes of action may differ from those which I deem most effectual, yet do I see in the declaration of the sentiments which these have made, the heralds of a new era. Faith [309] in man; in the instincts of the soul; in the omnipotence of love, is implied ther[e]in, and the day cometh, when this faith shall prove its might, and honour the principles in which it is grounded. The soul shall be deemed able to rule itself. It shall not deign to appeal to sensual weakness; it shall be strong in the spiritual armour of humane affections; magnanimous sacrifice; patient endurance; con- formity to its ideal. Duty shall be its only safe defence; its shield and protector: a man's life is the testimony whereby his principles shall be tried.-The noble soul will neither defend his reputation, nor his life, by other than noble deeds, divine words; and then he pleads not for himself, but for principles, in whose life he hath his own being. He opens not his lips, save to assert the divinity of principles. [310] A society was organized, called the "New-England Non Resistance Society." I did not join this association. I cannot unite with any body of men. My contemporaries do not apprehend the scope of my views. I must pray, preach, act, alone. By such means can I alone preserve my liberty inviolate. I must constitute my own society, priest; write my own creed. Thus have I done hitherto; thus must I continue to do, until I shall find souls who survey life from a nobler point of sight. This I deem not arrogance; but simplicity. September. Week XXXIX. [23-29 September] Conversation at Hingham.</page><page sequence="16">138 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 I gave a conversation, on Wednesday evening [26 September], of this week, at Hingham. A heavy rain kept some from attending. Yet a dozen or more were present. The evening [312] passed agreably. Those present manifested a desire that I should hold a course, during the the evenings of the coming autumn. This I shall be pleased to do. The following order of considering the topics, in succession, seems natural; while it allows of the freedom so essential to colloquial descourse. Self-Culture Con. I. Conversation, the primary method of Self-Culture. Its conditions, rules &amp; c. Con. II. Self-Culture. Man its subject. Analysis of man. Body- Mind-Soul. Con. III. Explanations-Illustrations. [313] Con. IV. Doctrine of Culture, inferred from Human Nature, and grounded therein. Law: Harmony &amp; Integrity of Growth. Con. V. Explanations and Illustrations. Con. VI. Doctrine of Body. Law: Temperance. Birth-Incarna- tion-Death. Con. VII. Explanations &amp; Illustrations. Con. VIII. Doctrine of Mind-Law: Genius. Instinct-Understand- ing-Reason. Con. IX. Explanations &amp; Illustrations. Con. X. Doctrine of Soul. Law: Holiness. Conscience-Faith- Works. [314] Con. XI. Explanations and Illustrations. Con. XII. General Survey of the Doctrines and Disciplines announced and enforced. Conclusion. By these great subdivisions, I fancy that the truths which I would promulgate, may be drawn into the light, and find evidence in the consciousness of men. I can say all that I desire, from these points. The whole field of Man, Nature, God, is open before me; and &lt;the&gt; opinions, traditions, creeds and customs &lt;of men&gt;, find classification and value thereby. [315] LXVI. Removal to Beach Street, No. 6. After much waiting and watching with referance to my course of action, I decided, as the safest and best, to resume my school; my friends, meanwhile, having made some exertions to obtain day scholars, and with some success. Accordingly, I left Cottage Place, during this week, and fixed myself and family, at No. 6 Beach Street, in a convenient House; intending to receive my pupils therein, the rooms being spacious and well adapted to this end. I shall be unable to carry out my views on Education, practically, and</page><page sequence="17">Bronson Alcott's "Journal for 1838" 139 in full, by this arrangement; but can do somewhat amidst the needs of this hour, to support [316] my family, and prepare for more efficient action, when my day comes; as surely it must. Principles are already on the ascendant in the best minds. These shall honour themselves, one day, and me thereby. But now, I can abide by them in faith; do what teaching the age shall let; and be still my own master. I purpose to gather as many children into my room on Sunday as I can, beside my day scholars, and, if possible, give a model of spiritual culture, for the Sunday Schools. To this end, the sum raised by subscription for the "Mission of Education" will, doubtless, be applied. My conversations in the villages, will I hope, prosper. I design to hold similar [317] meetings, during the autumn and winter, at my own house. Thus, what with my day and Sunday School, my conversations in the villages and the city, I expect to find employment for my faculties, and to furnish my basket and store also. During the last few months I have been without a&lt;n&gt; &lt;a&gt;vocation. I have done little. I have theorized much on methods of action. My vocation seemed almost wrested from me. Now I am to resume it. With what success, time shall show. My organs are, as yet, all inadequate. I live, however, in the faith that each succeeding year, shall prepare the minds of men, and forge the organizations needful to do justice to the principles which are now apprehended, but in part, by the few, who, like myself, labour in secret, and unrequited. [318] I number among my friends, the noblest, best, most gifted, men of the age-the very men who are forming, and shall give shape to the coming time. My circle of associates is limited; but yet choice. I am not desirous of adding to its number, save of men of like minds. The time is drawing neigh which shall try the faith of these. Only the strong shall stand amidst the obloquy that shall beset their lives. A persecution is approaching for opinion's sake. I have already been tried. I am now suffering for my word. Emerson's is even now, a name of reproach. The town rings with the cry of atheis&lt;t&gt; m1, atheis&lt;t&gt; Tm, Blasphem&lt;er&gt; Ty1!- Thus must it be. Truth is ever a word of blasphemy to those who have lost all sense of the divinity of its origin, and who, &lt;know&gt; 'heeding,[ not of its oracle in their own souls, seek the false voices of the times, in which they live. [319] October. Week XL. [30 September-6 October] LXVII. Review of "Conversations on the Gospels.["] A well written article on the "Conversations on the Gospels," discussing my Doctrine of Human Culture, appeared in the Boston Quarterly Review, for October. This was written, I presume, by the editor, Mr. Brownson.3l [320] It is grateful to be spoken of in terms of kindness, after the long and vulgar abuse that is wont to greet my ear. The writer sketches the outlines of my principles of culture, with some faithfulness. His manner is popular. He will win attention by it. He says:</page><page sequence="18">140 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 "Mr Alcott may not be sound in his philosophy, he may not be correct in all his views, and he may carry, and we believe he does carry, some of his favorite notions to extremes; but he deserves profound reverence for his determination to be a man; to be true to Human Nature; for his fearless assertion of his own convictions, and for his deep and living faith in God and Humanity. He aims to be himself and not another; to think his own thoughts and not another's; and having done this, he will not lock up his thoughts [321] in his own bosom, and seem to acquiesce in reigning dogmas; but will utter them, regardless of the reproach or injury he may sustain by so doing. Such a man in these times, when there are so few who feel that they are men, and have a part of their own to act, is not to be cast aside, to be trampled on, without great detriment to our social and moral progress. Did we know what is for our good, we should seek out such men, and honour them as prophets sent from God to foretell and to usher in a more glorious future." Novel words these to meet my eyes from the pages of a review. I accept the facts which they were intended to cover and feel that there is reality in these. The day dawns when I shall be seen and valued as I am. Now am I of small [322] account in the eye of the age; &lt;and&gt; my theories are deemed absurdities; my enterprizes failures. Not so always. I have done what shall not be lost. I have uttered what shall not be forgotten. The ears of future time shall hear my word, though this generation be deaf. I have yet other deeds to perform; other words to utter, more worthy than their predecessors. Am I not yet young. Have I not all my faculties about me, and doth not hope and faith illumine my future. I must on. Let no time hallowed dogma; no current opinion, or usage, hinder me, in my way.-Onward! Ascend, O Soul! be not thou embarrassed by vulgar roar, by times nor seasons. Know no limit to thy ascent; no hindrance, save thine own infirmity, which prayer &amp; labour, shall &lt;renew&gt; Tassuredlyl surmount. [323] LXVIII. Open School at No. 6. Beach Street. I opened my school at my dwelling, No 6. Beach Street, on Monday [1 October], of this week. Fifteen children appeared. I suppose others will be added, as the school becomes more known. I printed the following advertisement in the public prints of the city.32 Mental and Moral Culture. Mr Alcott will reopen his school at his dwelling, No 6 Beach Street, on Monday[,] October first, for the admission of children [324] of both sexes from four to twelve years of age. Instruction will be given in Spelling, Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, Geography, and English Grammar; with the Latin and French Languages, if desired. Particular attention will be given to the general discipline of the intellectual faculties, and to the manners and morals of the pupils.</page><page sequence="19">Bronson Alcott's "Journal for 1838" 141 Terms for the English Studies $ 8.00 with Latin &amp; French 12.00 children under 5 years of age 6.00 Thus am I again reinstated in a school. It is to consist, I imagine, from present appearances, chiefly of children [325] quite young, nearly all of them under ten years of age, many not older than six years. My instruction must, of course, be quite elementary. I like this in som[e] &lt;accounts.&gt; Irespects.1 It will devolve upon me the necessity of addressing myself to the simplicity of the minds over which I am called to exert an influence. This necessity is, in itself, an important means of perfecting me in the art of teaching. It brings me at once into the vision of principles, and checks all that is merely pedantic, or conventional. It demands sight. It forces elements into the light. It compels truth in her fairest, simplest, profoundest aspects. It deals with nature. He who can provoke the profoundest faculties of the soul, and quicken their action on the highest verities, through the simplest and most natural means, by illustrations of most familiar character, [326] by statements plain to the intuitions of the soul, fulfils the highest ends of culture. The highest truths, when presented rightly to the mind, by the skilful teacher, shall command the assent, equally of child and adult; for they are alike objects of sight to each. They address the common sense, as well as the moral intuition, of the soul. Beside this practice of my art, on the young, I shall have chance of action on the adult minds, by means of my conversation. I shall make experiment on the soul, at its successive ages, and states, of apprehension.-Time shall come when wider influence; opportunity of addressing greater numbers, both of children and adults, shall be given me. So whispers Faith; so sayeth God! [327] LXIX Visit from Emerson. Emerson passed an evening with me this week. He tells me that he intends to resume his lectures, early in December, at the Temple, giving ten or a dozen descourses, as usual, on his favorite topics; thus disposing of the materials which he has gathered during the spring and summer, at his rural abode in the town of Concord.33 Fresh and fair, as the seasons which grew these idyls in the soul of the poet, must be TtheirlA influence on those who shall hear them delivered. Pieces of nature must they be.-I shall watch with interest the favour these meet with from the people of this metropolis. If they draw an audiance at all, it must be a choice one. Not a little [328] of moral courage will be needful in order to attend them, so strong is the sentiment of the town against him. His Cambridge Address has staggered the slender faith of many.34 Fashion has declared against him. He has already paid the penalty of his former popularity. His lectures will, of course, be honoured by the absence of coxcombs. Bigots, will hold him as a profane person. Only true souls, who honour integrity and independence, who have insight into principles, seeing through the shallowness of traditions, usages, will make show in his lecture room. His work will try men. It will reveal the true from the false; the real, from the apparent. I doubt not that he will be sustained. All fair, noble, free, souls will appear. The age is not without such.</page><page sequence="20">142 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 [329] The enjoyment of his visit was somewhat marred by the intrusion of French Magnetism, &amp; English phrenology. These came in during the evening, and must, of course, be entertained. And while he left at nine, these tarried until twelve o.clock.5 Any other evening rather than this. But patience! patience! I shall spend next Sunday with him, and then we will hold all such at bay, and this with all due civility. I can see truths worthy of all note in these doctrines; but am far from crediting &lt;the&gt; charltanry, or charltans. &lt;Simple, or cunning, as may be;&gt; I would interpret these after my own fashion, and give my own theories therefrom. Organology is only the instrument of the soul. True science will &lt;rather&gt; predict the necessary form [330] of the organs- even the whole corporeal man-from the known laws of &lt;the soul,&gt; tbeing,l rather than, by the superficial examination of organs, determine the qualities of the soul. The soul determines the forms of the organs; not the organs the nature of the soul. The whole corporeal man, were its language rightly read, is ever a type of the character of the soul; but then the soul must be seen in its pure essence, in order that this type shall be read aright.-And so of animal magnetism. Faith in the soul shall give insight into the laws of that subtile agency which &lt;exerts&gt; Tacts4l by means of corporeal functions--organs and functions are conduits of the spiritual power. They indicate its existence to the senses merely; They give phenomenal being to reality. Believe the latter, and the former is: faith finds in sight what sense merely confirms in substance. LXX. Second Conversation at Hingham I held a second conversation on Wednesday evening [3 October], of this week, in this village. The evening was fine. Between thirty and forty persons were present. The topic of conversation for the evening[:] "Conversation-its practice as a means of Self-Culture; the importance of cultivating it as the high art of the soul &amp;c," was considered at some length; several persons joining in the discussion. It is plain that conversation, in this wise, is quite possible. I wonder that this plan of action had not occurred to me earlier; so simple and feasible, does it now seem. [332] But simple means are the last upon which we stumble, so artificial have we become. This is particularly true as regards methods of culture. I trust that I shall be able to show the beauty of simple communication, man with man, as the readiest and most effective means of self-culture; as well as its adaptation to the school room and Church. There are several very intelligent women in Hingham, whose practice of this art, for years, more than is common in a village like this, renders conversation more graceful, easy, and instructive, than I shall be likely to make it, in other places. The influence of Miss Thaxter will favor, in a great measure, the ends of my effort in this place. [333] October. Week XLI. [7-13 October] LXXI.</page><page sequence="21">Bronson Alcott's "Journal for 1838" 143 Visit Emerson at Concord. I rode to Concord, on Saturday, of the preceding week, to spend Sunday [7 October] with Emerson. I never enjoyed his society more. We had much talk. And how easily do we apprehend each other. Conversation is no effort at all. [334] This man is the wisest of his day. No man amongst us approaches him. His genius is of Olympian order. He is a seer of divine eye. I joy in his gifts. I feel honoured by his friendship. I have, at least, one contemporary, whose soul delights in the same Ideas that have charmed me, and in whose light we live alike. Behold! a future awaits us. We walk, side by side; and not alone, but in divine friendship and holy aspirations. So may the years shine benignantly on the purpose that we love! [335] LXXII. Second Conversation at Lexington. Emerson came with me, on Sunday Evening, to Lexington, where I met a circle for conversation. The topic the same as at Hingham last week. A few good things were said. Emerson and Dwight were the chief talkers, although the circle was quite numerous, near fifty persons being present. I purpose holding a course in this village. The people seem to have been prepared by the teachings of Emerson and Dwight to receive simple truth, without fear, and in love. I enjoy the idea of meating them in furtherance of the same great ends which have guided their Iformer[?]4, teachingsT.1 &lt;of their&gt; [336] These conversations, while they shall diffuse juster views of man, and of his culture, will also give agreeable action to my faculties. I need such stimulus. I would grow. And growth with me is provoked by action of mind on mind. My teaching is not sufficient. The children do not yield all needful excitement. I need communion with adults; and on the highest topics. An evening, spent in conversation, is a discipline most grateful. I shall be likely to reap such benefit during the ensuing season, as I intend meeting circles of friends in the city, at my room, on one evening of the week; besides parents and others at their dwellings, in addition to the conversations in the villages. [337] LXXIII. Letter and Books from London. I received, during this time, a communication, with valuable books and pamphlets, from Mr. Greaves of London. He writes that he recd. twelve copies of the "Conversations on the Gospels," of which he speaks as "an invaluable work;" and desires me to send him a dozen copies of Vol. III. deeming this already published according to advertisement in Vol. II. He also sends for a few copies of the "Record of a School" 2nd. Edition; and closes his letter by inviting "any instructions, admonitions, or divine sympathies that shall further the universal good." He delegates a gentleman by the name of Wm Oldham to</page><page sequence="22">144 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 write in his behalf."3 There must [338] be a circle of persons in London of free opinions, with which one would like to become acquainted. Of these, are Mr. Greaves, the friend of Pestalozzi; Wingman[?], the author of "Divination of the New-Testament," and other works on the Transcendental Philosophy, and teacher, also, of a school, for spiritual culture; Mr Oldham; and Mr Morgan, author of "Hampden in the Nineteenth Century," "Religion and and Religious Education." The latter of these works, I have just received from my friend E. P. Clark, who imported it at my suggestion." In this, I was surprized, though much gratified at seeing the "Record of a School" commended, as a valuable work for teachers, and the desire expressed that it would be republished in England; an event that may, I fancy, take place; and why not the "Conversations on the Gospels" also? [339] I insert, in this place, the titles of the works sent me by Mr Greaves:- 1. "Three Hundred Maxims for the Consideration of Parents, in Relation to the Education of their Children." This, by Mr. Greaves. 2. Spiritual Fragments: Selected from the Works of Wm Law. By Mary Ann Kelty. 3. Psychological Speculations. 4. Substance of a Lecture on Public Genius as a Moral Power, delivered at the Milton Institution. By John Heraud Esq. 5. Platonic Parables.38 [340] I intend to write immediately to Mr. Greaves. I should have done this in answer to his letter of September 1837. I will write also to Mr Morgan; in whose writings I have long felt an interest. It is now five or six years since I first heard of this gentleman. His "Hampden in the Nineteenth Century" interested me greatly when I first read it. This work I found at a Bookstore in Philadelphia, and with no knowledge of the author, immediately purchased it. To Mr. Kennett, of London, I will write also, concerning my Books sent him by my publishers, some months since, for sale in that metropolis.39 [341]-[342]40 [343] LXXIV Mr. Combe's Introductory Lecture. I heard the introductory lecture of George Combe of Edinburgh, at the Masonic Temple.41 The lecturer gave a simple history of his becoming a believer in the doctrines of Phrenology, and of the causes which had led him to come to this country, as a teacher of this science. His manner was quiet, unassuming; and &lt;the&gt; style of writing, plain and direct. He will impress many amongst us, by the constant appeal which he makes to the understanding--the faculty which is most active, and is peculiar to the native of New England. I have no doubt of his being received amongst us, and his doctrines, with much</page><page sequence="23">Bronson Alcott's "Journal for 1838" 145 favour by all men of mere understanding. [344] He is known as the author of "The Constitution of Man," a work which made a good impression on the minds of some of our best men. The impression made by Dr. Spurzheim on the community, will also favour his purpose.42 That our first minds will espouse the doctrines of phrenology, as taught by its present advocates, I have no belief. The doctrines are partial. They are but half truths. They are presuming. They teach the dependence of the soul on organs. They are grounded in an implied skeptacism of the soul's independence of the body. We want a philosophy that shall account for organization; reveal its laws; show how the soul incarnates itself in organs, replenishes, voids[?], these by its own power-a philosophy of body-building. This, phrenology is not. It is but the physiology of soul. [345] LXXV. Third Conversation at Hingham. The evening, being quite rainy, but about twenty persons were present, of the &lt;the&gt; thirty, who attend the course. Our conversation was quite practical. It was chiefly on topics suggested at the previous evening. I answered many questions.-There are some, comprised in this circle, who require statements addressed to the understanding, rather than to the moral sense; who like details, rather than principles; facts, rather than the grounds &amp; laws of facts. Always is this class most numerous. The practical rather than speculative faculties are unfolded in most. I wish to speak to [346] the needs of such. The discipline of conversing will be useful to me in this respect. It brings me in direct relation to the understanding, and compels me to deal with apparent facts. yet a conversation devoted exclusively to the practical uses of principles, is not so kindling as to that of principles and laws in their universal applications. I love to enter into the seats of being to discuss those forces which create and modify facts. But high colloquy of this nature does not always come. The soul is not always in fit mood; it does not always possess "the vision and faculty divine," when in presance of its kind.-I enjoyed this, less than the previous conversa- tion. I shall not, however, be at all surprized to learn, that this, was most agreeable to the majority of those present. [347] October. Week XLII. [14-20 October] LXXVI. Third Conversation at Lexington. I held a third conversation on Sunday evening [14 October], in this village. Nearly forty persons were present. Subject-Elements of Humanity. Instinct-Reason--Under- standing-Organization-were considered somewhat in detail. Habit was distinguished from Instinct. The Will was also considered. [348] The conversation, this evening, was in every respect, successful. It was sustained, animated, and inspiring. Five or six persons took a part in it. It was a demonstration of my</page><page sequence="24">146 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 favorite theory, that conversation was possible on the profoundest topics of human thought, even with those unaccustomed to deep meditation, or free utterance. The statement of great principles, provokes the inmost life, and brings the soul into the presence of its inmost being, making it conscious of the divinity that stirs within its faculties. It makes it quick and living. In such wise am I to enunciate the doctrines of the soul, and wake the sluggish faculties of the people in our towns and villages, to a conscious life in God, in nature, in their own personality. [349] LXXVII. Fourth Conversation at Hingham. About thirty persons were present at this conversation. The subject was, as at Lexing- ton, Elements of Humanity. This was considered in its general aspects and relations. We were less successful, however, in the treatment of it than at Lexington. The same desire to dwell amidst details was apparent as at our former conversation. But after some time, the subject was uplifted into the light of principles, and the conversation became animated and interesting. I perceive that some members of the circle are timid, as regards the free and full utterance of opinions on the theological bearings of topics [350] discussed. They have little self-insight. They live amidst traditions; are desirous of learning through the memory alone; loving history rather than prophecy. These encumber the free discussion of subjects. Yet these must be met. I have, thus far endeavoured, and, I think, successfully, to treat such with respect, and to speak to their needs. But very few of those who shall hear the opinions stated in these conversations, will apprehend their full import, or accept them as grounded in facts of the human soul. But all, will be quickened to deeper thought, and more liberal sentiments. Some will date the entire revision of their opinions, I doubt not, from the influence of these meetings. Mrs Alcott accompanied me this week. We spent the night with Rev. Mr. Brooks of the village; who attended the conversation. [351] LXXVIII. Theory and Practice of Conversation. My theory of Conversation, as the natural organ of communicating, mind with mind, appears more and more beautiful to me. It is the method of Human Culture. By it, I come nearer the hearts of those whom I shall address than by any other means. I reach the facts of the case. I am placed thereby in the simplest of all relations. There is nothing arbitrary; nothing presuming.-Conversation must be my organ of address to the public mind. Thereby am I to publish my views. Therein am I to exert my faculties most worthily. Amidst the living interest of conversation, I am to generate and compose works for the press. All [352] that I would say, will find fit utterance, in this wise. A faithful record of these utterances will become the material from which I shall be able to compile works on the subjects thus discussed, and with great ease to myself, as well as in practical shape for the public. Such colloquies, grounded in actual facts, and thus having historical</page><page sequence="25">Bronson Alcott's "Journal for 1838" 147 accuracy, will have more vitality &lt;, and reality,&gt; than it would be possible to give them, by any other mode of composition, or form of arrangement. I fancy that, by the aid of stenographer, a literal and full record of these conversations might be obtained. This I hope to be able to secure when our success with such circles shall render the conversations worthy of being recorded. I shall learn the art of conducting them skillfully, so that subjects [353] of highest moment, and profoundest character, shall be discussed fully and in order, by successive speakers. Those works which have made the deepest impression on the human mind, have been composed, in part, at least, in this form. Socrates, in Plato, communicates his wisdom, by means of dialogues. How far these, as left us by Plato, were ideal, it may not be easy to determine; the selection of this style of composition, by so great a master as Plato, and the practice of Socrates, are the highest testimony in favor of both. The Gospels, also, confirm the same. Jesus was perfect master of the art of conversing. It was his chosen organ of communication with men. How perfect the specimens recorded by his biogra- phers, especially, by John. [354] I would revive this lost art, and prove its primary place among the means of culture. I hope to make this so apparent, by the good fruits of my own practice, as to institute conversations in towns and hamlets, for the instruction and discipline of the people. I would like to devote myself exclusively to such labours. The people are hungering for the bread of life.43 They would have some simple and ready means by which they may declare their needs, and receive the necessary sustenance, without hindrance. Conversation is this means. It is equal. It is human. It interposes no false or imposing check upon the full and free communication of soul with soul. It is man addressing his fellow man, as god in the primeval age, ere sin had made him strange and distant in his intercourse. [355] LXXIX. George Ripley. I passed an afternoon with George Ripley, editor of the Philosophical Miscellanies, and translator of Vols I and II. comprising important papers from Cousin, Constant, Jouffroy, with critical notices of their opinions. Vol. III, comprising the Minor Poems of Go[e]the and Schiller, is in press, translated by my friend, J. S. Dwight.4 Ripley is a desciple of Cousin. He is Eclectic in Philosophy. He loves independence. He is free and brave. He is catholic. I deem him one of the strong men of the time. He has faith in the soul. He loves humanity. He believes in progress. [356] How rare are such souls. I will write the names of every such man, in our midst, on this very sheet; yea, on this very page:- I. Emerson, Alcott, Brownson, &lt;Bancroft&gt;, Ripley, Hedge, (Francis, Furness, Clarke, &lt;Stetson,&gt; Dwight, Parker, &lt;Osgood,&gt; W Channing &lt;,Robbins.&gt;) II. W. E. Channing, Dewey, Follen, Garrison, Walker.45</page><page sequence="26">148 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 These I deem the free men and the brave, by whom great principles are to be honoured amongst us. Class I. are philosophical, and, therefore, more potent. Class II. are practical, and, therefore, less efficient. The first, apprehend things in their prin- ciples, the second, in details. [357] The men who are to give currency to new ideas that shall create a new literature for us, worthy of the soul, have yet scarce appeared. These are but the heralds of such master minds. Emerson is the only man, of the number, who possesses creative genius, and in him more than any other, are my hopes centerred. His influence is already greater than that of any other man; or, if not wider, is deeper, and commands the best faculties amongst us. The young and growing minds are turned towards him. He is shaping their course in the fields of literature and philosophy, and the ideas which inspire his own soul, shall waken theirs. He acts on the minds amongst us who are to do the things. I have no great confidence in any other mind. All others lack creative power; [358] they are men of talent, of erudition, but not of insight, not of genius. Some of them are destined to exert a good influence, yet not a commanding one on thought amongst us. They are not creators. They are not eyes. They are merely interpreters and scribes, not of "the vision and the faculty divine." Scholars are these, rather than men; or if men, the scholar is not subordinated to the man-the condition, always, of highest power. As to my share in this grand revision of thought, and its expression in literature, time must show. I would write my word in, and from, the souls of the people, through the medium of conversation, thus drawing truth from the facts of common experience, rather than from the history of opinions, as set forth in the systems of philosophers, or creeds of theologians. [359] An attempt is making to foist upon us, the superficial philosophy of France, as the only authentic creed of the soul. Eclecticism is claimed to be its last, best, word. The works of Cousin are studied as the modern gospel, that is to illuminate the soul of our nation, breathing the breath of life into our literature, philosophy, theology, &lt;and&gt; Itol revise all our institutions. I deem this attempt unworthy of us. French thinking is not American thinking. Eclecticism is not deep enough for us. We ask a philosophy of life. We demand something more than a philosophy of criticism. We need an eye to read the facts of the present moment, and these in the light of our own life, not in the dim haze of the opinions of those who have gone before Tprecededl us. [360] We too have eyes. To us, the world, and the soul, and God, are bared. We are, as were the ancients, in their presence. We too experience their life. We live in them. Not alone in the memory, but in the life that we now live, are these revealed to us. And we demand the right of seeing these face to face for ourselves; having put aside the spectacles of the past. We are not blind. Traditions, creeds, systems, are to us but as waymarks, footprints, that indicate the career of the soul, in its past sojournings to the beatific land of Truth; &lt;but not&gt; Ias, inns, and havens, wherein we are to tarry, save for a day and a night: not our goal.</page><page sequence="27">Bronson Alcott's "Journal for 1838" 149 History is useful to me no farther than I am conscious of the same facts in my own experience. It is in the light of [361] these that I apprehend the facts of history. I am the highest, and therefore, the only authentic fact, that can legitimate the facts of all the past. Erudition is not insight. It is not what I take upon my memory, that sheds light into my soul; but what I see by self-intuition, that makes me wise. Give me my own soul, and the world; and then, do I find all other souls, worlds, in these. I bring them into my sight. I go not to them; they come to me. All history is contemporaneous with my present life. It is a commentary on my experience: My light illuminates the darkness that antiquity may cast over it; I pierce this darkness, and see the same old eternal verities that once charmed the ancient world. I become a contemporary of truth, not of men: I am beyond the range of history, I antedate its records, which [362] can only testify to the facts &lt;,that I see in the higher witness of my own soul.&gt; of which my own soul bore prior testimony. History can only confirm prophecy. I see, and, as my sight is unobstructed by impurity of life, do I see clearly, and deeply into the causes of events; and, therefore, anticipate their appearance in time, which constitutes them facts of history. The pure soul foresees, which is prophecy. It pierces the limits of memory, and is face to face with eternal facts. By memory and foresight, the soul dates and antedates the facts both of history and prophecy; having oversight &lt;both&gt; of nature, time, space, and insight of itself. Eclecti- cism has but one eye, and that is in its hind head, not forehead. It gropes amidst the &lt;bones&gt; Igravest of the Past, and &lt;gathers the bones of the dead, thereby seeking to find&gt; Iwrites &lt;the history&gt;1l the history of the soul, in the relics of cemetaries! [363] October. Week XLIII. [21-27 October] LXXX. Fourth Conversation at Lexington. Mrs A. rode with me to Lexington, on the afternoon of Sunday [21 October], of this week, and was present at the conversation, in the evening, which closed, after an animated and interesting discussion of the doctrine of Instinct, at nine o.clock, after which we returned to our lodgings, in Beach St. [364] To discriminate, and make plain, the life of the Instincts from that of the Reason, is the popular difficulty. There is a very general distrust of the instincts. Men deem them bestial, vulgar. They see nothing divine in them. They deify reason instead; or distrusting this, in the fear of &lt;trusting&gt; relying too much on their own faculties, take refuge in a blind and vague notion of a traditional revelation. As to what faculty of the soul this revelation is addressed, what faculty or sense of the soul apprehends its truths, they give no account. They do not feel the divinity of the instincts, and know, that, through these, is the revelation of all truth made to the reason: that these are the light shining &lt;in&gt; Tamidst, the darkness of things, and falling on the dim orb of reason, which sees thereby; even as the light of the material sun, illumines the objects of the opake world, and Topesl, the eye of sense [365] to perceive them, in the ray of its resplendance. Thus instinct is to Reason what the sun is to 1thel material world. It is a quickening, enlightening, ray from the Orb of God. Instinct with the life of God, the pious soul dwells and shines in the light of his divinity. All his faculties, functions, are quick, intuitive, alert, and prayer ascends perpetually from the sanctuary of his nature to the throne of the Ideal, whose heaven of heavens is within the</page><page sequence="28">150 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 depths of the divine being that he is. Duty is the commanding law of his faculties, and he strives, both in thought and act, to obey its requirements. He bows reverently before the high throne of the Ideal whereon sits the Awful Ought, and ever seeks to conform the low Actual to its commandments. He worships, and obeys this ever present deity in whose life his faculties live, and by whose light they shrive and bless! [366] This circle, consisting of near forty persons, seems quite interested in the words uttered. As yet but few join in the conversation. The majority are content with listening. Mr Dwight, (who teaches regularly as their minister on Sunday,) and two or three others, constitute the speakers. These people are less affected by traditions, current opinions, creeds, and dogmas, I fancy, than most villagers. Mr. Emerson taught them on Sunday, for two years or more, and was succeeded by Mr. Dwight, who has been with them during the last twelvemonth.46 They seem better prepared for the doctrines which I would state, in their hearing, than are others less favored. I shall do something by way of confirming their minds in the principles of human culture. Among those forming the circle, are several teachers of schools. These I shall benefit, by imparting worthier views of their art. [367] LXXXI. Foresight. My friend, and former associate in the school at Germantown, Penn, became a tenant of the same dwelling with me.47 He, with his family, occupies one half of the house. By this arrangement, I reduce my rents to $200 per ann[um] and secure a commodious dwelling with a spacious room for my conversations and school. I now find employment. But not of a kind to task all my faculties. Five hours of each day are given to my school. I have, at this time, near twenty pupils mostly under 8 years of age. I find some pleasure in forming the characters of these into the beauty of [368] intellectual and moral excellence. Yet the labour is arduous; the results slowly realized; and my services but dimly appreciated, and scantily rewarded. Nevertheless, I have my reward. Would that as many more; yea, ten times as many, could receive the benefit of my influence, and thus my pleasure be increased in tenfold measure, as well as my faculties taxed to the utmost. My day will come. I wait for it; and will do, meanwhile, whatsoever shall come to my hand, though it be unworthy of my gifts. My conversations afford me very agreeable exercise of faculty. I grow a little by them. I shall soon open them in my room. A circle can doubtless be gathered in the city. Friday evening of each week, as before, I intend to give to this end.48 I mean also to meet the parents of my children weekly at their houses for conversation. [369] I shall soon have adequate employment. I shall create a sphere of action for my faculties. None of the existing organs of action are suited to my genius. Teaching by lessons, or lectures, or preaching, Tdoes notl, give me full and free scope. I demand something more earnest, thorough; touching the quick of the soul. This is to be done through conversations. I am to be Tone ofl the Talkers of the age. In this wise, am I to teach. And my talking is to reach all classes and ages. I am to converse with the young: I</page><page sequence="29">Bronson Alcott's "Journal for 1838" 151 am to speak with the old: with the child and adult. And with the erudite and illiterate; the simple and the bigotted; plain men, and proud men. I am to hold colloquy with Humanity, in its various aspects and conditions. Thus am I to have scope for my faculties, and a worthy work on my hands. I see my field, and am entering upon it. [370] How far my course may be impeded, by the opposition that success, in this form of teaching, shall provoke, remains to be seen. By and by, an outcry will, I suppose be raised against me. How far the people will have a willing, unprejudiced, ear, to listen to my word, I know not, nor how many will entrust their children to my care. Speak I must. And speak my word fearlessly, yet reverently. In the end, I shall have audiance. But this comes not yet in full. Persecution first. I foresee it. Already have the vials of bigotry been poured on my head; they are, even now, dashing Tagainstl, the head of Emerson; and when any public movement of mine shall become generally known, I must receive my share of reproach, from the popular idols of the time, whose Godhead I gainsay. [371] LXXXII. Fifth Conversation at Hingham. Our circle was small on Wednesday evening [24 October] of this week; the weather being very inclement. Nevertheless, we had fine conversation; chiefly, on the theory of Revelation. I gave a statement of the facts necessary to the production of a Gospel, showing its ground and root in the human soul. I find several persons, in this circle, whose minds are quite ready for the admission of light, on the great topics of the soul. These have outlived the traditions and usages of factitious life, and would fain return to the simplicity and reality of nature. They are meek and docile seekers. They are charmed by sim-[372]plicity. They would live in the light of facts. They would no longer dwell amidst the shadow of conventions. The world, God, and man, are dawning upon their vision in a divine beauty, and they joy in the revelation. In the soul, do they see All in All, and apprehend the All in It. I please myself with the idea of finding the free and fair souls who are born into the light of day, by means of my conversations in the towns and hamlets. In each of these, are persons, I fancy, who are waiting for words of life. Wheresoever two or more souls are gathered together, in the name of Holiness, there shall a gospel meet with acceptance. It is these that my word is to embolden. Not on the many, but on the few, shall I act; on the free, the noble, the brave, the excellent, [373] I address the instincts, the moral sense of men; those faculties which dignify and hallow the soul. Character is the end of my teaching. Not talent, merely; not erudition; not manners; but the free, fair, harmoneous soul, do I speak to, and unfold. To others my word shall oft become absurd; my truths, lies; my declarations, blasphemies; my theories baseless. It is to Experience that I speak: and only those who have lived the life of the diviner faculties, shall apprehend the facts thereof, in their reality. Experience of these, is the proof: without this, such facts are not. Doing is knowing. He that doth not, knoweth not. A pure life clarifies all the senses from motes of evil. It is the condition of all insight, all</page><page sequence="30">152 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 revelation; it is th[e] testifier to all the truths of the gospels of the soul. [374] Insight, the deepest insights of the soul, are the word of life. Within the soul are embosomed all facts, and these deep insights discover the order and the law, by which these shall become, sooner, or later, events in time and space. Both historian and prophet is the soul. Instinct is the prophet; insight the historian. Behold how the one doth evoke from the graves of memory, all buried facts of antiquity, and the other invest these with life, making them new in the Ideal of the Soul. Janus-faced, the soul looketh backward upon the hoary experience of past centuries and millenniums; and forward, over the future career that awaits its youthful faculties; Tsurveyingdl the Old and the &lt;Young&gt; New&lt;, surveying&gt; in the Eternity of its being. Ever is its experience a history and a prophecy of the immortal life that slumbers in its faculties; a ceaseless revelation to itselfl- [375] LXXXIII. Fifth Conversation at Lexington. I rode to Lexington on Saturday [27 October], of this week, and gave my fifth conversation in the evening. About twenty persons were present of the circle, Mr Dwight among the number. We had much talk on the Law of Culture. Conscience, the moral sense, was assumed as the supreme law of the soul. Therein, did the Godhead unfold his attributes; and publish his Will, to all the subordinate faculties and members of the soul. This was the sense of the Perfect. Obedience to its dictate unfolded all the faculties of the soul into the beauty of their Perfection. Within Conscience, was the divine theocracy of the [376] Soul administered; which, like the agency of gravitation on the material world, seduces all the faculties and members of the soul to harmony and &lt;beauty.&gt; lTorder.1 By conformity to its will, all are unfolded into the fullness of Beauty. The questions of a revelation, was also considered, as having its life in Conscience. It was this which created the Sacred Books. These were the history of its Will, Words, and Deeds, as revealed through the lives of holy men, at successive ages of the world. The Bible was the literature of the moral sense. It was Duty embalmed for the World. Various opinions were stated, by members of the circle, and different degrees of assent were given to the doctrine &lt;state&gt; thus presented, as more or less faith was felt in the Divinity of the soul. [377] October. Week XLIV. [28 October-3 November] LXXXIV. Preaching. I met the children of the Sunday School, in Lexington, and read them some parables from Krummacher.49 They seemed interested. Mr. Dwight gave two very fine descourses, full of faith in the soul. I had some [378] conversation, with various persons residing in the village, on high topics, and returned, in the afternoon, to my family in Beach Street.</page><page sequence="31">Bronson Alcott's "Journalfor 1838" 153 Mr. Dwight's, is now the only preaching in our midst, worthy of that name, that I know of. Emerson is silent. Who is there, having deep and infinite faith the soul beside. All men now preach traditions; How few who know of aught else. Who will listen to the veritable words of the soul, unless interpolated by creeds and traditions of antiquity. No man hath a modern gospel. No man apprehends the living facts that constitute the daily experience of the soul. [379] LXXXV. Sixth Conversation at Hingham. Our circle was full, on Tuesday evening [30 October] of this week; and the conversa- tion animated and prolonged. We discussed the Law of Culture. The birth of conscience in the soul was stated and illustrated at some length. Various questions, some implying doubts as to the authenticity of conscience, and the consequent necessity of a Revelation from a higher being than the soul itself, were put, and answered as the insight of the moment suggested. We entered into the depths of the subject. Yet were unable to consider it in its amplitude and fullness, during the time before us. I can but make statements, and answer such [380] questions, as these shall provoke from the minds of those present. The fruits are to be borne at a day, more or less remote, according to the fertility or barrenness of the soil in which the seed is sown, or rather, as the words uttered shall cherish the latent seeds of the soul, quickening these into growth and maturity. Miss Thaxter, with Mr. Smith, Teacher of the Derby Academy in the village, and Mrs Smith, are very apprehensive, and give dignity and influence of a local nature, to the views stated.50 Rev. Mr. Brooks is usually present, though seldom does he give an opinionT.1 &lt;as to the merits of the views presented.&gt; Mr. and Mrs. Smith, with Miss Thaxter, confirm &lt;these&gt; Tmy doctrineskl usually, by facts of their own experience. [381] LXXXVI. Sixth Conversation at Lexington. I walked to Lexington on the afternoon of Saturday [3 November] and held a conversation in the evening. Our conversation was lively, familiar, and more colloquial than usual. We discussed the Doctrine of Culture; considering, somewhat in detail, the Authenticity of the Moral Sense; its agency in the production of Gospels; its statements to the Reason in the formulas of Creeds; the condition upon which Revelations were possible; how from Living, Truth was ever revealed; how conscience was ever the last, best, word of the soul-its breathing life-TtheselA gave rise to much talk.-Mr Dwight was absent. [382] I had a long sequel to the conversation, at the house of &lt;Mr&gt; TMrs4l Robbins, to whose hospitality, &lt;and that of his wife&gt; and daughters, I am usually indebted for lodging and refreshment, when I frequent the village.51 I am the more and more satisfied, by the intimacy &lt;of my relations&gt; with the people, which these conversations promote, that I should devote myself chiefly, if not wholly, to this style of teaching. I think I foresee that I am to impart my word in this wise. My success, thus far, surpasses my expectation at the</page><page sequence="32">154 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 outset. Time and experience shall show me is the value or practice of my theory of talking with the people.52 [383] November. Week XLV. [4-10 November] Theory of Walking. I walked to Boston from Lexington on Sunday morning [4 November]. It is quite refreshing to think on foot. The brisk circulation that walking promotes, and the vision of [384] nature, which presents fitting images for the thought, as it rises in the soul, make this exercise vastly conducive to the highest ends of culture. The Perapatetic philsophers had facts in their favor.53 Body and Soul, were, by this means, quickened and invigorated to the fulfilment, of the great ends of living and thinking. Amidst the scenes of nature, under the wide cope of heaven, treading, erect, the plane of earth, man finds all his faculties addressed; &lt;and&gt; thought, at once, seizes its images and reflects its face upon the soul. Study is perfect only when aided by the presance of nature. Without this, the mind labours through the memory, and can do nothing more than evoke the ghosts of departed thoughts into its vision. [385] LXXXVIII. Advertisements. From the "Boston Daily Advertiser," I take the following advertisements, indicating the purposes of the persons therein named. These I preserve as historical documents of the day and the age:--- [386] Emerson's Lectures, will, I doubt not, draw together all persons amongst us, who are seeking for truth, and ready to look upon her serene countenance. The docile, the true, the pious, will frequent his lecture. I hope also to bring to my Conversations on Friday evenings, which I open on Friday [9 November] of this week Tat my dwelling,4 many such persons, for high colloquy on the Divine things of the Soul. Something shall thus be done for the realities of life, amidst this age of shadows and shams. I await the issue. My hours, during the ensuing season, shall not glide by amiss, so the soul be honoured, and I be suffered to utter my word into hearing ears. [387] LXXXIX. Seventh Conversation at Hingham. The evening was very pleasant, and the circle quite large of persons present. We had further conversation on the Law of Culture as declared in Conscience. Mr Brooks was present, and had many questions of a theological nature to put, which gave the conversa- tion, during a part of the evening, somewhat of a sectarian character. The fear was manifested, by some, that the authenticity of the Sacred Books, was questioned, and the historical evidence in regard to them, brought forward.-I have all the popular traditions associated with the facts stated in these Books, to meet and dispose of, as I best can, at the moment. Sometimes I get a [388] clear and satisfactory statement of these, where[i]n the facts of the case are brought, in their true relations, before the mind: sometimes the</page><page sequence="33">Bronson Alcott's "Journal for 1838" 155 insight of the moment is not equal to the occasion, and truth suffers thereby. But, afterwards, the right thing is said, and all is made plain to the docile and seeking heart. I find some bigots in this circle. Their creed is put in jeopardy by the staements made, and they set themselves to its defence, by urging all the commonplaces of sectarianism. I shall shake the faith of many in the authenticity of current opinions on all topics connected with the nature and ministries of the soul. I shall suggest many quickening ideas to members of this circle, who will date the renovation of their thoughts from hearing these conversations. [389] XC. First Conversation on Friday Evening. A few friends were present at my room on Friday Evening [9 November]. As no special pains had been taken to inform those who feel an interest in the topics to be discussed, in this manner, on Friday evenings, but few attended. But as the purpose becomes known, there will be no lack of speakers or listeners. My fear is that these meetings will become popular, and thus their great end be defeated. Free, fair, full, bold, utterances are what we seek. Truth, truth-this is the end of our communion one with the other. We come as seekers: we feel that we [390] have not fully attained to the fair vision of her transcendent beauty. Creeds, traditions, usages, forms, are of small regard beside her commanding presance. We credit the past no farther than it honours truth, and records its triumphs. That a few persons thus in quest of truth, and holding freedom in esteem, may be found, I doubt not. These will find each other. Friday evening will, I fancy, bring them together. I open my house, and say "come in, all free, docile, souls; come, utter whatsoever you have in your minds, and let us know each other." The conversation, this evening, was between Mr. Dwight, Russell, and myself. We had high descourse on "the Doctrine of the Godhead." [391] November. Week XLVI. [11-17 November] XCI. Seventh Conversation at Lexington. I walked to Lexington on the afternoon of Sunday [11 November], and gave a conversation in the evening. Pursuing the order of topics proposed at the outset of our course, we entered [392] upon the consideration of the corporeal relations of the soul. I briefly stated the doctrine of the Body: entering into the functions of breathing, eating, drinking, sleeping, &amp;c. These were all deemed acts of the soul. Birth, death, were slightly discussed. But we did not enter into the mysteries of the subject. Another evening will furnish occasion for such colloquy. The true theory of Incarnation has not, I conceive, been revealed. The dependence of the body on the soul is not seen. Those physiological facts which are to confirm this theory are not observed and collated to this end. Organization is a mystery. Science ventures not to compile its laws. Religion deems such attempt impiety.-But I [393] look</page><page sequence="34">156 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 forward to the day, when men shall apprehend these r[e]condite facts in the light of a pure and reverent faith; when life shall bare its subtile forces to the eye of the soul, and its agency in the creation and replenishment of the corporeal organs, through which it comes forth into the presence of the senses, shall be more clearly known. Then hunger, thirst, sleep, fatigue, lust, &amp;c. shall be understood. Birth, death, shall have rightful value in the apprehension of man. The soul shall reveal its eternal life; and declare, by all these organic states and functions, its vital immortality. Then shall it be seen how it doth constantly build its own body: form its various organs; replenish their waste; void their substance; enter and retreat, according to its own will, from the structures which [394] it doth organize. It undergoes sepultre and resurrection. It builds and unseals its own tomb. Organization is the grave into which for its terrestrial day, it tabernacles; yet with the blessed hope of a glorious resurrection, from its imprisonment, to the light of celestial centuries. At birth it organizes its members; it continues to replenish the waste and wear of these, while it remains an incarnate nature; but withdraws, at last, in death, from such shadowy existence, amidst tombs, to a simpler mode of being. Enwombed in matter, incarnated in flesh, entombed in clay, it dates itself in time, and marks its history in space; but passes on, in the cycle of its own eternity, no longer an embodied spirit, amidst the shows of matter. [395] XCII. Eighth Conversation at Hingham. The evening was splendid. More than the usual number of persons were present: among these, my brother in law, Rev. S. J. May. We entered, at once, into the depths of the sublime doctrine of the Incarnation of the Soul; discussing the subtile facts of birth, life, death, immortality. Descending into special corporeal instincts, we noticed, respira- tion, sleep, dreaming, waking, hunger, thirst, &lt;sight,&gt; Iseeing,, hearing, &amp;c. I talked more true to facts than usual on this occasion; and wrought more, by this effort, I fancy, than by any former one. [396] The facts of the organic life are more within the reach of common experience, than those of the intellectual and spiritual. All men know somewhat about these. All eat, drink, sleep, and have insight into ordinary needs. Hence the illustration of recondite laws of the soul, by means of these, makes appeal to the understanding, and experience of all. The corporeal instincts are more generally experienced than either the intellectual or spiritual. &lt;Not&gt; TButtl a few, indeed, gain clear insight of any other functions of the soul. Most live in the organs, and are more or less strangers to the intellectual and spiritual life. [397] XCIII. Second Conversation on Friday Evening. Several persons assembled, at my room, on Friday evening [16 November]. We had a long conversation on the doctrine of Instincts. There is no word, in our language, which has become more desecrated than that of Instinct. And yet none is of more divine import. Why this profanation?</page><page sequence="35">Bronson Alcott's "Journal for 1838" 157 Because man has violated the integrity of his soul, and introduced evil and lies into his faculties. He has profaned the sacred courts of his being; he has lost all consciousness of the divine instincts [398] which are the life of his soul, and knows not of the Divinity that stirs even in the midst of his very passions. He deems himself bestial, because the&lt;s&gt; corporeal life rules and subordinates the intellectual and spiritual in his eyes. He distrusts himself. &lt;His instincts are not apprehended. He deems them vulgar, because he employs them to vulgar ends.&gt; Familiar with the corporeal life, chiefly, he deems all life like it. All instincts, are, hence, corporeal. All life is animal, organic. He is an animal. He is a beast. Thus he des[e]crates his own soul; he becomes a lie to himself: he profanes all his instincts and words typify the facts within him alone. [399] November. Week XLVII. [18-24 November] XCIV. Eighth Conversation at Lexington. I rode to Lexington on the afternoon of Sunday [18 November], taking my eldest daughter with me.55 We had a very satisfactory talk in [400] the evening. The doctrines of the Incarnation of the soul; the functions of the corporeal life; the organization and dissolution of the body; the immutability of soul, and mutability of matter, were sepa- rately considered, and in connexion. Our talk lay over the subject of the Corporeal Relations of the Soul. I find that speaking from the organization, yields more than from abstractions. Both at Hingham and in Lexington, also, the conversation on this topic, has been of deeper interest to most, than any of the preceding. We came nearer to the very facts of the soul. We penetrated farther into the sacred courts of life. [401] XCV. First Conversation with Parents. On Monday evening [19 November], of this week, I met a circle of parents, at Dr. Flint's, for conversation, on the doctrines and methods of Human Culture."6 Most of the patrons of my present school, were present. We had agreeable talk on the subject of Corporal Punishment. I gave my views, in brief. I find that most of those who now patronize my school, are unfriendly to corporal punishment. How generous their views I have not learned; nor on what grounds they disapprove of it. By means of these interviews, I shall be able to ascertain the state of sentiment among them, on the [402] great subject of culture. I hope to ensure their sympathy in my views, and cooperation in my enterprize. I shall never demonstrate the principles of the true culture, in practice, unless parents shall first be made to apprehend the law, by which that practice is guided. They must not be left to judge empirically of results; they must apprehend the principles by which practice is directed; referring given cases to general laws. Education is a science. The art must be learned by the study of principles. Parents must come at once into this study. They must read the souls of their children; and adapt all discipline and instruction to the needs of this nature.</page><page sequence="36">158 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 [403] XCVI. Ninth Conversation at Hingham. The conversation, on Wednesday evening [21 November] of this week, was well attended. We considered the Corporeal Relations, still more in detail. Much was said on the laws of dietetics. Eating, drinking, sleeping, exercise, &amp;c. were considered. It is difficult to speak on subjects of this nature, involving the practice of those who hear, with entire success. Plain statements of principles, in their applications to practical details, become personal. Men find themselves hit. He who speaks thus shoots his arrows at random. He knows not who shall flutter&lt;,&gt; wounded&lt;,&gt; and reveal the quarry [404] he has pierced. I had hoped to get some talk on this topic from members of the circle, but most were quite dumb. They were ready to discuss it in its general bearings; but shrunk from personal applications. How difficult it is to concrete principles. This is, indeed, the great work of the reformer. "Hands off' cry all men whose interests, pleasures, creeds, usages, are affected by the statement of principles in living relations. No harm is apprehended so long as these are viewed in their abstract bearings. Danger is only in the attempt to give them a living concrete form; embodying them in institutions, creeds, usages, opinions. With most indeed, the abstraction is all! God is Van4, abstraction; attempt to state his being in concrete, incarnate, man and the outcry is, "Atheist!["] [405] XCVII. Tenth Conversation at Hingham. I rode to Hingham, on the afternoon of Saturday [24 November], and gave my tenth conversation in the evening. Rev. Mr. Frances, from Watertown was present. We considered, or attempted to consider, the Intellectual Relations of the Soul.-A part of the evening was spent, however, in discussing the Doctrine of the Godhead-a topic &lt;upon&gt; 'tol which the people of this village, are, at this time, more specially drawn, by the Address of Emerson before the Students of Divinity, at Cambridge, and the Reply of Mr. Ware.5' The personality of God, is said to be called in question, by this address, and some of the members of [406] this circle, are quite fearful of being drawn into the admission of such doctrine by receiving, with favor, the statements of my conversation. Hence much questioning, and cross questioning, in order to learn my views. Hence long episodes and digressions from the main topic of remark. Mr Francis seemed quite disposed to show his dissent from the doctrines of the address, and of the conversations; as have Brooks[,] May, and Phipps, who have been present, from time to time.5" It is quite easy to connect with any new opinion a name of reproach, and thus hinder its acceptance by timid or simple minds. Atheism is the term now applied to these views of the Godhead. [407] November. Week XLVIII. [25 November-1 December] XCVIII. Ninth Conversation at Lexington. I rode from Hingham on Sunday morning [25 November], stopping to dine at home,</page><page sequence="37">Bronson Alcott's "Journal for 1838" 159 and, in the afternoon, proceeded to Lexington. [408] We had satisfactory talk on the Intellectual Relations of the Soul. These people are quite simple. They are not seeking conformity with historical creeds, but insight into truth, as it relates to their special growth in grace. They are not alarmed at novel doctrines. Though less cultivated than the members of the other circle which I meet in Hingham, they are yet more simple and sincere. I shall benefit them, in no small degree, by the statements in which I indulge, in these conversations. [409] XCIX. Second Conversation with Parents. I met a circle, chiefly patrons of my school, and parents, at the house of Mr. Curtis.59 We considered the subject of the Spiritual Instincts of the soul, as distinguished from the Intellectual and Corporeal. I purpose to consider the nature and relations of the soul in Infancy and Childhood, as the preliminary to a right apprehension of the Doctrine and Practice of Culture. There are many mothers in this circle. It is to them that I aim to speak. I invite their experience. [410] I invite them to ask questions on special cases. I would aid them both in the theory and method of education. I have long wished to meet such a circle to such end. The members of this, though not remarkable for virtue or intelligence, seem sincerely interested in the study of the art of culture. They are, I fancy, less bigotted than my former patrons. They are less timid, time serving. I hope the result will prove such. I shall meet with them, from week to week, in hope.-I propose the following topics, as occasions for conversation:- Evenings 2-3. Moral Culture. " 4-5. Intellectual Culture. 6-7. Physical Culture. 8- Review. [411] C Meeting of the Symposeum Our Club met on Wednesday afternoon [28 November], at Mr Bartol's, in Chestnut Street. The following gentlemen were present: 1 Dr. Follen 2 Dr. Francis 3 Emerson 4 Alcott 5 Russell 6 Stetson 7 Bartol 8 Clarke 9 Dwight and 10 Parker" The topic proposed for consideration, was "Pantheism." This, of course, introduced the whole subject of the Godhead; and the conversation took a wide range. It was [412]</page><page sequence="38">160 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 free, bold, and, sometimes, profound in statements. Emerson, Dwight, and myself, had most of the statements to make, and it was put to us to illustrate the doctrines of the Godhead. There is, after all, but little thought on the great topics of theology, even by the members of this circle. Traditions and usages still dominate over the minds of these priests of the Modem Temples. They fear full, bold, fair, entire statements. The mind is cowed. Men dare not utter what they believe. The people are held in awe. Ministers lack boldness. They have but shallow insight. They are timid. The intellect of the clergy is subordinated to vulgar interests, creeds, practices. It is even yet under the tutel&lt;l&gt;age of the [413] Past. Its faith is historical. It does not read the facts of the soul amidst the miracles of life. It does not apprehend the Gospel which life is ever revealing to the regenerate faculties of the soul. Even in the secrecy of this club, where men would be tempted to indulge in the freest utterance of thought, I observe a timidity, a shrinking from the entire surrender of the soul to its noblest instincts. Men have not gained confidence in their faculties. Like children, just venturing to &lt;support themselves&gt; Twalkdl, they need the support of elder times, on whose traditions and usages they lean; and deem themselves strong in &lt;the&gt; borrowed aidq.lI &lt;of such lights.&gt; When shall we see a soul filled with that self-relying trust, and, drinking in the life of its own essence, boldly [414] surrendering itself to its God-driven instincts, and find&lt;ing&gt; it[s] own might in the faith and hope of its own faculties. Such was Jesus. Such must all souls, who would prove themselves worthy of the attributes of the Godhead, with which they are entrusted. Human Nature! no man hath divined its glory. No man knoweth its endowments. No man is bold enough to prove its might. None hath found the Godhead in its secret depths. [415] CI. Ride to Emerson's with Mrs A. I rode to Concord, with Mrs A. on Friday [30 November], and dined with Emerson. Mrs Ripley, from Waltham, and Mr Bradford, from Plymouth, dined with us.6' The conversation was quite general. I had some talk with Emerson before the arrival of other guests. But little was said of an interesting nature. The ride was very pleasant, the day being fine. We reached Concord about 11 o clock, and left &lt;for home&gt; at 3. At 6. we reached home. Mrs A. much in-[416]spired by the jaunt. I take but little satisfaction, in such visits unless I can have free, unreserved, continued, conversation. I would not only see my friend's face, sit at his fireside, and board, but have insight into his inward self; commune with his soul in familiar manner. The formality of intercourse is saddening to me. I am made solitary thereby. I am driven into myself. I am alone amidst the show. I become but an observer. I cannot descend into the &lt;vulgar&gt; circle, but sit &lt;apart, and&gt; silent, and apart.</page><page sequence="39">Bronson Alcott's "Journal for 1838" 161 O Simplicity where art thou fled! I look abroad wherever I go, but find thee not. No man is simple: all masquerade. How hard it is, amidst glitter and show, to shine and be, in very &lt;deed!&gt; word, and deed! [417] CII. Third Conversation on Friday Evening. Several persons were present on Friday evening [30 November]. Among these were Dwight, Parker, Russell, Bowditch, Flint, Frothingham, Norton.62 We had pleasant talk on Genius. Various views were presented. We have not, as yet assembled all who are to compose this circle. They come in slowly. It will take some weeks to bring us together. I have entire faith in the purpose. Men of free, bold, fair, soul will be drawn in, from week to week, as the purpose becomes known. By and bye we shall have talkers and listeners. [418] Perchance this same "Friday Evening Circle," shall become the means of gathering around the highest Ideas, the good and true souls in our midst. It may be the new age in its incipient form. Herein shall all creeds, traditions, usages, institutions, be tried in the light of principles. Freedom shall, for a few brief hours, from week to week, be honoured. The soul shall be worshipped. Human nature be seen in its divinity. The Godhead shall be traced in all things. Headquarters of all Heresies.-this may be deemed: for all Truth is heretical, in its first annunciations. Truth is the Ancient Heresiarch. Creeds, dogmas, traditions, ever flee before her, or do battle, with fear and dread. [419] December. Week XLIX. [2-8 December] CIII. Tenth Conversation at Lexington. Miss Thaxter from Hingham, spending a few days in town, rode with me to Lexington, on Sunday afternoon [2 December], and was present at the conversation in the evening. We resumed [420] the Subject of the Intellectual Relations, entering again into the consideration of the Intellect, as a function of the soul, though subordinate to the moral nature, shining always by a reflected light. We had a pleasing talk, and rode home after 9 oclock, the evening being very fine. I find an agreeable companion in Miss T. She is unusually apprehensive, inclining always to the highest view, and refusing every vulgar or profane statement, as false. She has taken a deep interest in the Conversations at Hingham, and exerts an elevating influence on the mind and manners of her native village. [421] Almost every member of the circle at Lexington, seems deeply interested in the subjects upon which we touch. A few remark on what is passing in their minds before the circle. Most however are silent, yet ready, listeners. They have quick ears. Questions</page><page sequence="40">162 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 suggested by the conversations, become, from week to week, topics of private thought, and social interest, while amidst their wonted occupations and familiar friends I feel more and more assured of the benefits of such meetings. They are practicable. They are useful. They will put worthier topics into currency. The people in the villages will be furnished with subjects for conversation. Their minds will be quickened. They will be sent out into the actual world with hearts and minds more living and active. [422] They will be made conscious of their own faculties. They will take the culture of these into their own hands. They will be made quick in all their faculties, able to sit in judgement on those who profess to be their teachers. Ministers will be tried by the standard which the statement of worthier views of man, nature, and God, shall serve to establish in their minds. The people will become more truly conscious of their own wants, and having their eyes opened to see the inadequacy of popular teaching and preaching, will demand and obtain that which is true and sustaining. Now the common soul is hungry for living bread. It must be supplied. Let the people see that they have it not, and forthwith it shall be set before them. [423] CIV. Third Conversation with Parents. A pleasant circle, and conversation, on Monday evening [3 December], at the house of Mr Everett. We resumed the consideration of the moral nature and relations of the child, and dwelt, at some length on the means of quickening and unfolding Conscience, as the supreme law of the soul. The members of this circle do not, as yet, venture their own opinions: a few ask questions, but these are seldom put, so that I have most of the talking to do. It will be so at first. Bye and bye, when the strangeness of the relation in which we stand, shall have worn away, this reserve will disappear; [424] lips will be unsealed, and there will be conversation, free, living, animated, and inspiring. I find quick and willing ears, a readiness to hear and entertain. I doubt not that these conversations will be highly useful. Every indication is fair at present. Something of this kind was wanting to complete my efforts as instructor while at the Temple. I had little or no communication with parents. I had little cooperation from them. There was great misapprehension. I was sacrificed to false impressions. The people knew not what I had actually done for the renovation of education in their midst. They do not even now dream of the good deed which I have done in their very city. My labours for Human Culture are not known, nor valued at their full &lt;cost&gt; price. [425] CV. Letter to Miss Ela, Concord, N.H. I wrote in answer to a correspondent in Concord, N. Hampshire, sending copies of the "Record of a School," first and second edition, and the "Conversations on the Gospel[s]," agreeably to her order. This person, Miss Ela, I became acquainted with last August at Lowell, during the sittings of the A. Institute of Instruction, and had some</page><page sequence="41">Bronson Alcott's "Journal for 1838" 163 conversation with her on topics of education. She is engaged in teaching a seminary, for young women in Concord, and is seeking for light to direct her in the art of culture."4 There are, doubtless, in our villages &amp; hamlets, persons truly interested in the welfare of the young, and intent in seeking [426] means for their culture. When I call such to mind, it carries me back to the time when I too was a villager, and teacher of the children thereof. How anxious then was I to learn from all sources within my reach. How full of interest &lt;was&gt; lati the reception of a new work on education. I wish I could put into the hands of every such person, copies of my books. Rather that I could see them, enter their schools, give them samples of methods of instruction and discipline. The time, I dream, is coming, when I shall meet teachers, parents, &amp; others, interested in Human Culture, and descourse freely with them on this great subject. But now am I doing my little work here on a dozen or two children, with but occasional action on adults. [427] CVI. Second Meeting of Symposeum The members of our Club met again, on the afternoon of Wednesday [5 December], at Mr Bartol's, for conversation. The following gentlemen were present:- 1 Stetson 2 Bartol 3 Russell 4 Mr Adam from Calcutta. 5 Alcott 6 Clarke 7 Dwight 8 Parker 9 Ripley 10 Bellows 11 Bradford" The conversation was animated and sustained. We entered upon the further consider- ation of"Pantheism.["] I stated the doctrine [428] that life was the primary fact, of which all theories of the Godhead, were attempted interpretations. Life was a universal conception. It was common to all natures. The identity of all things and beings was in this subtile essance. From Life sprang Light. Intellect and Sense, and organization were forms of its manifestation. After an agreeable conversation of three hours, most of the gentlemen adjourned to hear Mr Emerson's Lecture, at the Temple, commencing at Seven o. clock, to meet again, for further talk after its delivery.66 [429] CVII. Emerson's Introductory Lecture. There was a grand and inspiring statement of the primal facts of the soul. The audiance was choice. The truly worthy of the metropolis were present. Fashion was not there. Timid conservatism was not there. Bigotry did not show her face. Young</page><page sequence="42">164 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 men and women, yet rich in promise &amp; hope, were there. The free, the bold, the seeking, docile, were there. Reverent faculties came to find devout exercise, and found such indeed. I recognized every hopeful, devout, [430] person of my acquaintance, whether youthful or of matured age, present at the lecture. It was a hopeful fact in the history of thought amongst us, that so many were assembled, on such an occasion. It was full of meaning. After the lecture several gentlemen repaired to Mr Bartol's and had further talk on the Doctrine of Life. Mr Very, Mr Smith of Hingham, were present.67 I invited members of this club to meet at my house on Wednesday afternoon, before and after the Lecture, for further conversation. I hope this will be a settled plan while the Lectures are in delivery. Thus shall we have concert and life. [431] CVIII. Eleventh Conversation at Hingham. The subject of the conversation for Thursday evening [6 December], of this week, was the Moral Relations. We had an agreeable talk. I entered, with some particularity, into the great Idea of Duty, speaking of responsibility, of retribution, of Perfection. I ventured upon an analysis of the Ideas of God; of Heaven; of Hell; Reward[,] Punishment, Justice, Mercy &amp;c. Conversation must needs be eloquent on such high and sublime topics. There were but few speakers this evening. I said more than usual. I had docile, attentive listeners, and believe the hours were [432] spent to the good of those present. I gave utterance to my last, best, thought, on the doctrines of Duty; the Godhead, as the ideal of the soul; heaven as its beatitude, hell as its diabolic state of being: the phenomena of conscience were stated and illustrated: The Bible of Tradition was discriminated from that of the true conscience; the literature of the moral sense; &amp;c &amp;c. I found great pleasure in this effort. I believe the members of this circle are entering more and more clearly into these views, as presented, from evening to evening. I succeed in finding the facts of their consciousness, and an answer to my statements. [433] CIX. Fourth Conversation on Friday Evening There were more persons present at my room, this evening [7 December], than at any former time. We had high conversation, chiefly on the Doctrine of Forms. I entered into the great subject of the predominance of the Senses over the Conscience, showing its effect on the various theories of the Godhead, and the general Idolatry to which it gave rise; regarding both Reason and Sense, unless subordinated to Conscience, idolaters. They worship ideas, or idols, not seeing these to be typical of instincts, as love, truth, good &amp;c.</page><page sequence="43">Bronson Alcott's "Journal for 1838" 165 Present were Garrison, Palmer, Russell, Dwight, Norton, Frothingham, Chapman, &amp;c.68 [434] This was a bolder, freer, talk than I have ever witnessed before. Every speaker uttered himself fully, without fear of traditions, without reference to existing opinions or institutions. The spirit of every one seemed to be crying "Behold a new Heaven and a new Earth";69 for the present hath passed away, and a new one is in the quickening life of the soul, renewed and perfected by the sense of its own Creative Might, and Divine Glory.-These were some of the boldest, bravest, meekest, souls, uttering their pro- phetic instincts. Reform was implied in this very consideration of Forms. The True and living God was revealed amidst the idols and idolatry of the age. &lt;Theism,&gt; Atheism, Pantheism, deism, anthropomorphism were all seen to be indications and statements of the Godhead more or less &lt;partial and&gt; conformed to the Idea of Perfection in the Human Soul. [435] December. Week L. [9-15 December] CXI. Eleventh Conversation at Lexington. The conversation on S&lt;atur&gt;Tunlday evening [9 December], of this week, was at the house of Mr. Beals, with whom I passed the night.70 We had a long and interesting talk, commencing at 7 and continuing until near 11 oclock. The subject was the moral relations. I gave a statement of the [436] facts and phenomena of conscience, including the doctrine of retribution; of God; of Evil; of shame, remorse, heaven, hell, unclean spirits, demons, angels, death, resurrection &amp;c. This was one of the most interesting conversations of the course. Attention was deep and unbroken from the beginning to the end. I feel greatly encouraged by the docility of this circle. They seem quite ready to hear, and entertain any opinion however at variance from the current notions of men. I enjoyed my visit at Mr. Beals'. He is a simple truthseeking man. Human nature in its unsophisticated state yet shines and glows in him: and so in his companion. It gives one hope in man to behold such specimens. [437] Perchance, it shall be my mission to minister to the spiritual needs of the simple, meek, docile, souls, as I shall find these in my walks through the villages and hamlets. I have a Gospel: how shall I publish it? By meeting the people at their own homes, and, in simple communication with them, in circles, or families, utter what I have in my mind. This seems to me to be the way in which I am to quicken the minds of the sluggish, and meet the wants of the conscious. I must go to them. I must see them amidst the relations of familiar life. Conversation is my organ. And while I am thus finding the hungry and thirsty, the lame, the blind, the possessed, in the villages, and doing whatsoever I may for their needs, by reviving, sustaining words, Emerson will be pointing the minds Ieyeskl of [438] the simplest souls, in the cities, towards the same truths. His mission is to scholars; to men in whom the intellect has</page><page sequence="44">166 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 become the predominating faculty, who are pleased with the setting forth of truth in compositions that imply the exercise of intellectual skill. These men are to be won. He will win them to the apprehension of truth. He addresses the thinking, intellectual, conscious, men of the day; and, in doing this, utters much for the unconscious and trusting souls, to whom my word is more specially addressed. Thus shall the Gospel of the Soul be published, and quicken the best souls of the day.-Behold the sowers have gone forth to sow.7 The ground is tilled here and there, and the seed shall, ere long, bring forth rich golden grain. Cast the seed into age. The harvest is near! [439] CXII. Letter from Mr. Very, of Salem. I received a letter on Monday [10 December], of this week, from Jones Very, of Salem, formerly Tutor in Greek, at Harvard College, which institution he left, a few weeks since, being deemed insane, by the Faculty.72 A few weeks ago, he visited me, when we had the conversation to which he refers in his letter; and he was present, also, on Wednesday evening last [5 December], at Emerson's lecture, and at the Club, at Bartol's, after its delivery. He is a remarkable man. His influence at Cambridge on the best young men was very fine. His talents are of a high order: some disquisitions of his on the Genius and Works of Shakespeare, I am [440] soon to read: they are said to be compositions of a pure and noble genius.73 Is he insane? If so, there yet lingers glimpses of wisdom in his memory. He is insane with God; diswitted in the contemplation of the holiness of Divinity. He distrusts intellect; he would have living in the concrete, without the interposition of the meddling, analytic, head. Curiosity, he deems impious. He would have no one stop to account to himself for what he has done, deeming this hiatus of doing, a suicidal act of the profane mind. Intellect, as intellect, he deems the author of all error. Living, not thinking, he regards as the worship meet for the soul. This is mysticism in its highest form. He is more of this spirit than my English correspondents, Greaves and Oldham. [441] I copy the letter. Salem Dec 8. 1838. Mr A. B. Alcott Since my conversation with you, at your house, when I recognized, as I told you, something in you which the Spirit within me did not approve, I was led to get your "Remarks on the Gospels,"" and I there find that curiosity which I before remarked in your conversataion. This I write to you in Spirit, that you should leave all which hinders the Spirit of God from creating you again in his image; for while you retain it you still have some of your own will which we must give up entirely to find rest. God is our Father who is in Heaven:75 that is, in this rest, where we have, in the first place, no will opposed; and, in the second, where that has entirely gone, [442] when we have a good one, like his own, which we always submit. You have not yet entirely fulfilled the mission of John within</page><page sequence="45">Bronson Alcott's "Journal for 1838" 167 you. He must entirely decrease before Christ can send the Spirit to baptise you into his kingdom, which is not of that world of your own will, in which you still linger a little.76 John is still in prison; the sensible miracles have been done within his knowledge, but he still doubts whether he shall be raised from the spiritual death which he feels within him. He doubts because it is hard to believe this greater miracle which he has not yet experienced within him. He sends to enquire if this is the Christ which is preparing within him, or if there is some other. Jesus points the messengers to his visible cures as the proofs that He is that one who has even that power, and says to them "tell John that the blind do see, the lame do walk, the dead [443] are raised now on earth, and when I ascend to my Father I will send the Spirit to raise those spiritually dead in like manner. Blessed is he who is not offended or discouraged in coming to me. The way is hard and requires the abandonment of all the will, yet it is sure, and on that very account a rest. John while yet unborn leaped in his mother's womb at the voice of the mother of Jesus. May the spiritual John within you be stirred at the voice of him who speaks from Heaven. You have not gone out into the wilderness to see a reed shaken with the wind, nor one clothed in soft raiment, they are in the palaces. You have gone out to fast. Fast therefore, come neither &lt;neither&gt; eating nor drinking for so is John to be found.["]77 Many are called by his voice, but few are chosen by Christ's. For many rejoice to walk awhile in his light, but faint by the way, and many of his desciples think themselves [444] through idleness already within the kingdom, &amp; thereby offer it violence. But all that come before are thieves and robbers.The weary and heavy laden shall find rest. Rejoice ye weary! ye whom spirits mourn! There is a rest that shall not be removed; Press on and reach within the heavenly bourn By Christ the King of your salvation proved; There is a rest! rejoice ye silent stars! Roll on no more all voiceless on your way; Thou sun! no more dark clouds thy triumph mars; Speak thou to every land the coming day; It comes! bid every harp and timbrel sound; Bring forth the fatted calf, make merry all; For this the son was lost, and he is found, Was dead, and yet has heard his saviour's call; And comes within to drink the new made wine, And as a branch abide forever in The Vine. [445] You have now the good tidings of great joy, and I hope they are such to you. Be up and doing, for the night is at hand in which no man can work. The Spirit of the Lord is at hand and ready to be poured out on every soul, to discover the dark places of sin and build up forever the habitations of the poor. The heralds are sent forth for the marriage feast; may you soon have put on the wedding garment, lest we sit down without you. If you will read this letter to your class it will be my presence and for their comfort. Remember me to your wife. And if you see Mr. Bartol tell him from me, if you will, that most of my sonnets have been sent, I believe, to Dr. Channing, by Miss Peabody,78 and I</page><page sequence="46">168 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 suppose he can see or obtain copies of them in that way. This would be better than for me to send any to him one by one. This is also for your information. Amen, Jones Very [446] Mr Very was present at our last Symposeum, at Mr Bartol's, and made some interesting remarks on life-will-love, &amp;c. He said much that was true, and expressed himself with great beauty. His language is that of an Oriental, and one might almost fancy himself in the presence of St John, whose words he affects. He is a phenomenon quite remarkable in this age of sensualism, and idolatry. He is a mystic of the most ideal class; a pietist of the transcendental order. How few these are of sufficient insight into the soul to apprehend the facts of which he speaks, divested of the oriental dialect in which he puts them. He will be deemed insane by nearly every man. [447] CXIII. Fourth Conversation with Parents. I met quite a number of my patrons, and their friends, on Monday evening [10 December], for conversation on Education. The topic for the evening was the Intellec- tual Relations-or Intellectual Culture. I said much on the defects of our current systems of early culture with reference particularly to the intellect, and stated some of the methods by which a more thorough culture might easily be effected. These people are chiefly listeners to my word as yet. Now and then a question is put, by some one, but, in general, [448] they sit attentive hearers merely. I talked two hours this evening, with but two or three interrogations, (from 7 till 9 o clock) when general colloquy was had between individuals. People are less simple in the city, than in the villages. They are less open, candid, independent. They are more biassed by extrinsic considerations. I meet this circle with the feeling of being greatly misapprehended, not supposing an adoption of what is uttered, as possible. Still I think the members of it quite as free as citizens in general, and somewhat less bigotted than most on the subject of education. Good will come from the conversations in the end. [449] CXIV. Third Meeting of Symposeum. The following gentlemen were present at my house, on Wednesday afternoon [12 December], of this week. 1-Stetson 2-Ripley 3-Dwight 4-Russell. After a pleasant conversation, somewhat miscellaneous and desultory, including miracles, mysticism, conditions of apprehending the views of another, we adjourned to hear Emerson's Lecture." I read Mr Very's communication to those present. Mr Ripley remarked that it resembled the last letters of George Fox, both in thoughts and images."A</page><page sequence="47">Bronson Alcott's "Journal for 1838" 169 The mysticism [450] and Pietism were alike common to each. The latter is little more than a repetition of remarks made by Mr. Very at his last meeting with us at Mr Bartol's. I hope the writer will outgrow this partiality to the oriental dialect. A professor of languages, one would think, should incline to a more modem and western speech. We want the facts of the soul translated into a modem dialect. We want the English of the matter. The oriental dialect is not ours. Yet we are treated with this alone, as if it were a part of factual truth, by those who teach and preach. We need the Gospel of the nineteenth century, published from the soul as it now is, and in the images of this modem world. [451] CXV Emerson's Second Lecture on Home. At Seven we left for the Temple. Miss Thaxter, from Hingham, having spent the afternoon with us. Emerson gave a beautiful picture of the childhood of the soul, detailing its advancements Tpilgrimagel through &lt;the&gt; nature &lt;into which had just entered,&gt; and return again into itself-its true home. The audiance was large and very attentive. After the lecture several gentlemen came to my house, where we had two hours conversation, chiefly on the love of power in the soul. [452] The following persons were present after the lecture:- 1. Emerson - 2. Dwight. 3. Bartol - 4. Palmer. Miss Thaxter. We meet again on Wednesday fortnight [26 December], at Bartol's, before and after the lecture for that evening. I hope these meetings will be held often, during the season. The children of light8' should often assemble and justify wisdom of her offspring, amidst this age of bastard pretenders. [453] CXVI Twelfth Conversation at Hingham. I went to Hingham on the afternoon of Thursday [13 December], and held conversa- tion in the evening. We pursued the subject of the Moral Relations into some of its bearings, especially as regards the law of Retribution. Our circle was small this evening, and the conversation quite desultory, though interesting. As our course draws near to its close, members of the circle seem to feel deeper interest in the topics considered, and to apprehend them in the light of general principles. This was far from being the case at the beginning of the course.</page><page sequence="48">170 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 [454] The truth is that the soul is attractive to all men, when presented in simple and ideal lights to the mind. Heretofore it has been made anything but attractive. Human nature has been degraded by false theories, the product of degraded souls, and hence when men come to think of it, they associate with it, the ideas which these theories, and their own imperfect practice, suggests. The divine in the soul has scarce found a language; only the bestial is represented; only this is known and believed in, by the many. Diabolus rather than God, hath shown himself in the creeds and lives of men; and so the former hath the monopoly of his experience, and teaches him the devil-tongue in the very deed. [455] CXVII. Fifth Conversation on Friday Evening [14 December]. We had conversation at my room on the Instinctive life of the soul, tracing its action, in the modified forms of Intellect and organization. I gave an analysis of the soul, in its threefold branches of &lt;Soul&gt; HeartI, Mind, Body-in Will, Reason, and Organization. Present, this evening, were- 1. Russell 2. Norton 3. Frothingham 4. Palmer 5. Tolman.82 It is difficult to have animated talk [456] with the faithless, sensual, idolotrous. I find such in all circles. The world is full of such. O for meek, docile, believing, men! O for &lt;that&gt; "charity that thinketh no evil: that vaunteth not itself; is not puffed up"83 with dogmas, usages, vices! O for sincere, simple, men, to shame a world of cunning, bigotted, irreverent, pretenders; shadows of men; lies subsisting on truth; duplicity on unity; evil on good! Demons-ghosts of once holy souls,-apostates,-these are, and who does not find them, in his walks among mankind. Sadducees and Pharisees how many!- [457] CXVIII. Twelfth Conversation at Lexington. I walked to Lexington, with Mr. Dwight, &amp; gave my conversation in the evening [15 December]. The Moral Relations were further considered. We spoke of the phenomena of shame, of guilt, of retribution, in some of its simplest forms. These people are good listeners. They are quite willing to hear; they entertain novel statements, if perchance good shall be found in them. I deem them as free from narrow sectarian, bigotry, as any people with whose spiritual state I am acquainted. Seed sown in the soil of their being, shall be quite likely to spring up and bear fruit. [458] I would fain sow wheresoever the fields are mellow-and ready for the seeds [of] man's scattering. &lt;To survey the country&gt; I would go forth, scattering wheresoever I may, and awaiting the harvest, which many many years shall alone suffice to ripen, and other husbandman reap and gather. I would cast seed into 1"thelI Age. After times shall reap. He that soweth shall scarce survive to reap also. The mortal is too shortlived to</page><page sequence="49">Bronson Alcott's "Journalfor 1838" 171 harvest the immortal. The seed ripens not during the life of the sower. It is an immortal plant, and doth but lift its head above the surface, during the terrestrial season; genera- tion, after generation, behold its slowly advancing maturity, and the one sitteth under its shadow; while another partaketh of its fruits! Genius eats not of its own planting; it feeds its successors. [459] December Week LI [16-22 December] CXIX. Dr. Follen's Lectures on Pantheism. Returning from Lexington, on the morning of Sunday [16 December], I heard a lecture from Dr. Follen in the evening, on Pantheism."4 These lectures, of which he intends to give four, are intended for the present juncture, when men's minds in this [460] quarter, are more or less agitated by the question of the nature of the Godhead. Dr. Follen purposes to give the history of Pantheism, as it sprang up in India, and took various forms, in Greece, in the religious philsophies of the New Platonists, and in its latest statements among the Germans; particularly in the systems of Bruno, Spinoza, Schelling &amp;c.85 I purpose attending these lectures. He very kindly sent me a ticket of admission. I should like to learn the views of those who have inclined to this statement of the Godhead. What I have in common with them, is a point of some interest. I am charged with this heresy.-Dr F. is learned in the philosophies of the Soul. I shall thank him for the facts: making my own deductions, of course. The public will learn, I trust, that Pantheism is not Impiety; that the best and noblest souls, have inclined to its forms. [461] CXX Fifth Conversation with Parents. I met quite a large circle on Monday evening [17 December], at Mr Morse's, for conversation.86 We had much talk on Intellectual Culture. The inadequacy of our present systems, (if systems they might be called) was dwelt on, at some length, and methods more in accordance with the nature of the soul, stated and illustrated. The subject of discipline, especially as regards modes of chastisement, seems to interest members of this circle; who are not advocates for corporeal punishment under any circumstances. Our talk thus far, has had more or less reference to this branch of discipline. [462] The interest in these conversations increases, if I may judge from the increasing numbers who frequent our circle, from week to week. On this occasion, thirty or more persons, were present. Dr. Flint, Frothingham, and one or two of the women present, were the only persons who ventured remarks, or proposed questions. As yet, these are descoursings, rather than conversations. But the descourses make talk, and by and by, we shall have conversation in truth. I deem this the chief good. I would make talk on worthier topics, in families, in private circles. This alone were a worthy end. But more</page><page sequence="50">172 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 than this, talking will provoke thought. The attempt to give an account of the views of another, will lead to thought in the mind of the reporter. I feel somewhat encouraged by the present aspect and effect of things, in this particular. [463] CXXI Emerson's Lecture on The School. The lecture, this evening [19 December], was fine. He dwelt on the agencies by which the education of the soul is achieved. These were the intuitions of Instinct-the corporeal wants-the condition-persons-books-yet chiefly facts. But the true soul made all his teachers pupils and ministers. Instincts subordinated the body-condi- tion-persons-books-facts-the great end of culture. The audiance was much larger than on former evenings, and the company choice. I observe that many, who once found all manner of fault with the speaker, now come to hear him. The city seems in better humour. It must [464] yield this matter. All the true men are saying "this may be so." And it shall be so. The city is already taken. It shall be convicted out of its own mouth. Bye and bye, the villages shall add "yea and amen""' to the same statements. Light is shining, and all the children of light, are emerging from the darkness in which the past hath buried them. New ideas are dawning on the souls of the hopeful. The Orb of Light is using and shall chase away the clouds of error, traditions, lies, that obscure the vision of the soul. After the lecture, Emerson came &amp; passed an hour or two, in conversation, at my house. I showed him the pamphlets sent me by Mr Greaves from London, and also Mr Very's letter, of a few days since. From him I received, this evening, the following sonnets. [465]88 [466] These are a sample of the sonnets written by Mr Very, during the last few months. Some which I have seen are better than these. His poetry, like himself, is quite unequal. I see him, at times, &amp; am much impressed by the soul of the man. I reverence it. I feel myself, in the presance of a superior nature. He upbraids me; he rebukes me. I feel whatsoever of pretence, of sham, there may be in me. At other times, he seems wild, mystical, and I rather pity than worship the presance before me. I am the insane now, and now the sane soul. What does this mean? [467] CXXII. Concluding Conversation at Hingham. Mr Dwight rode with me to Hingham, on the afternoon of Thursday [20 December], and was present at my last conversation in the evening. Most of the circle were together. I gave a brief Review of the topics discussed at the successive evenings of the course, which was followed by very animated conversation on the doctrine of the Godhead, a topic which had intruded itself at almost every conversation, and upon which differing opinions were expressed. This was by no means strange. The doctrine of the Godhead includes, indeed, all other theories and statements of the soul. It is, indeed, the alpha and</page><page sequence="51">Bronson Alcott's "Journalfor 1838" 173 omega of the soul. All thought begins in it; all [468] speculation ends and returns into it."9 Hence it is involved in all the forms and manifestations of life. It is the formula in which piety states the divine in the soul. I closed by some remarks on the pleasure and profit which I had derived from meeting the circle; and on the feelings and views which had actuated me in conducting these exercises. I was pleased to find that I had met and partially supplied a want of the soul. I feel sure of having done good. Many have been quickened by the statements made. Some have ventured upon a career of thought, some have discovered the shallowness of current traditions; some are enquiring what is, and what is not; a few are disturbed, and turn [469] away, taking refuge in the time-hallowed and conventional, which has so long lulled the soul to sleep. The fruits of these interviews are yet to appear. Whatsoever of truth has been worthily uttered, shall not fall to the ground without germinating, and, sooner or later, bear its harvest. As for the rest, it is chaff, and shall be blown away by the winds. I have been encouraged by this attempt; and discouraged also. I am encouraged by the sensibility of the people to their wants, by their docility. They do ask for light; light they should have. My discouragement springs from the sense, made the more obvious to me by these conversations, of my own darkness; my inability to enlighten according to their needs. I would speak to persons, as well as the race. I would help single men and [470] women to apprehend and supply their spiritual wants. I would be an interpreter of the soul. I would teach the doctrine of the soul; and illustrate the disciples and duties that reveal and mature it, in the fulness of its divinity. I would inspire men with a reverence for their own nature; with the worship of the highest in the soul. Trial of this same thing in the villages, will, I fancy, enable me, in due time, to fulfil this end of a true teacher. I shall learn my art by the practice of it. I shall not wholly fail, if I do not fully succeed. Hope-Faith-are yet the angels whose shining presence accom- panies me, and I shall go forth amidst the dark, and lustreless age, to do whatsoever I may in shedding light, and inspiring life.

Sixth Conversation on Friday Evening. The circle was quite small this evening [21 December]. Frothingham, Palmer, Norton, and myself had the conversation. We discussed various high and divine topics- the incarnation of the soul-the genesis of matter-generation of organs-nature of instinct &lt;&amp;&gt;A.1 theory of the Godhead. These persons seem quite in earnest in their speculation. I find more or less of sympathy in thought with them. Norton seems to me, a free strong, souled, man, disposed to follow his highest, best, thought, quite indifferent to agreement or disagree- ment of the same with current opinions and usages. I detect [476] neither fear, nor exclusiveness, nor bigotry, in his thinking.-Frothingham seems to have pursued his thoughts quite isolated from men, and betrays, not infrequently, a bigotted adherence to his own modes of thinking. He had well nigh been buried in the grave of phrenology, but seems to live, and bids fair to rise from this tomb of the soul. Still he is yet clad in his grave cloths, and is, withal, quite spectral. I think him earnest in his pursuit of truth. He believes in the spiritual nature of man, and speaks of organs for all the faculties of the soul. Organization yet holds, however, too prominent a rank in his theory; the soul seems still imprisoned in it.-Palmer is a rare man. Entirely free from all superstitious regard for the past, simple, meek, docile, loving, he seeks for the best in all his thinking. He is a child of Love. He has faith in its might. [477] He thinks love is the fullest, fairest, attribute of the Godhead, and would have all men live, and move and have their being in it. So deep and earnest is his faith in this divine affection, that he will &lt;not&gt; Itakel counsel &lt;any&gt; Tof nol other in the conduct of his affairs. He will have nothing to do with money. He has set himself for the overthrow of Mammon. His sacrifices in putting his theories into practice have been great; while travelling the country in pursuance of his mission, he puts himself on the charity of persons entirely, and if refused food and lodging, seeks shelter in barns &amp; outhouses, and subsistence from the fields and or- chards. He has printed and circulated several numbers of a paper which he calls, "the Herald of Holiness," in which he states his views regarding Man, and his institutions.--At present he resides in Boston. He is a printer [478] and labours at his handicraft, receiving</page><page sequence="54">176 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 his bread, shelter, and wardrobe, as some equivalent. He intends soon to publish a statement of his views on the Idolatry now so prevalent regarding money. He deems all men idolaters of Mammon: and would win them from the worship of the Idol, to the service of God. I have seen him but a few times. My interest increases in him at every interviews. What a noble fact it is that a man, simple, meek, modest, beyond almost all men, should arise, in these days of gold, to expose the selfishness, pride, injustice, cruelty, to which the demon leads, and illustrate the charm and beauty of Love! "Go to, now ye rich men, weep and howl for the miseries that are upon you."9' [479] CXXV Close of Autumnal Quarter of School. I closed the Autumn Quarter of my school, on Saturday [22 December], of this week. My number of pupils, has been fifteen. I have passed the hours, from 9 in the morning, till 12, and from 3 till 5 o clock, with them daily; with the exception of Wednesday and Saturday, on which days I did not meet them after 12. o clock. They seem to have enjoyed their communication with me. Most of them are quite fond of school and, when their habits on admission are taken into view, have made promising advancement in conduct and learning. I have conversed much with them, have led them as fast as I could to the study of their own nature, [480] helping them to find the roots and grounds of all true wisdom, in the facts of their own souls. To this great end all their lessons have had direct reference. All words in their spelling lessons have been made the subject of free conversation. Their reading has been subjected to the same criticism. Writing has been practiced constantly. The theory of numbers has been explained as fast as they could apprehend it. And their conduct, at all times, made the subject of free and friendly remark. In regard to methods, I have pursued those which long experience has proved most conducive to my great ends. Corporeal chastisement I have not resorted to, in any instance. I have appealed to the sense of duty, to love; not to fear, not often to shame. [481] My pupils are quite young, none of them over 10 years age. Of course all instruction addressed to them, must be elementary and simple. I have found some delight in my intercourse with these young souls. They have been a study. But yet I sigh for wider opportunity of seeing and demonstrating great principles of culture. My means, materials, are too limited. My great purpose is encumbered. I am not free. I am not aided. Men do not know what I would do. But I live in hope. I cannot have children, until I shall first have opened the eyes of parents. This I am doing slowly. My conversations on Monday evenings are bearing some fruit doubtless, and, if continued, shall bear more. But I want a wider field; more persons-larger audiance. [482] I cannot but feel myself commanded, by an insight into the needs of the soul, to go forth amidst the people, and reveal, so far as I may, the doctrines and disciplines of culture. A few years devoted to this great purpose, would, I</page><page sequence="55">Bronson Alcott's "Journal for 1838" 177 am sure, generate life, and diffuse light in the souls of the people, and in the warmth and radiance thus quickened. I might enter upon an experiment, with adequate means, and generous faith and patronage, to prosecute it, undisturbed, to some successful issue. Till such work be done, the advent of my Day, hath not come. Shall I not go forth and hasten it? Who is there to do this needful thing. Parents, the people, these must be quickened to a sense of the divinity of the soul, and the meaning of the Family-which is, the Godhead concreting his attributes to sense! [483] CXXVI. Concluding Conversation at Lexington. I gave my concluding conversation at Lexington, on Saturday evening [22 December] of this week. The circle was large, nearly every member being present. After the review of the topics discussed at the successive meetings, further conversation was had on the doctrine of the Godhead.-This great subject will intrude itself whensoever the soul is under consideration. It is implied in all discussions of &lt;the&gt; Spirit. It is the alpha and omega of thought. People in the villages are stagger[e]d by any attempt to realize this statement in the intellect. They cannot approach the Godhead, save through Con- science. [484] They deify the moral nature. But this they do unconsciously. They demand aid of the senses, in order to realize him, and conceive of him in their own corporeal, instead of spiritual image. Thus they &lt;conceive of a&gt; Tregard God asl, a person like themselves; and speak of his personailty, as quite distinct, extrinsic, from their own souls. As yet, men are not sufficiently acquainted with the divine in their own souls, to bear the identification of it with God. This is deemed impiety, blasphemy. So was it in Judea. Jesus declared this great truth, and the people would stone him. Thus they stoned, or burned, or vilified, by worst names, the pure and divine, who, like him, asserted this fact of the Godhead. Shall those [485] who, now instinct with the same fact, venture to utter it, find other treatment from the many? No. Men will have it so. God is a separate, independent, nature, alien to their souls, because in their blindness and ignorance, they ar[e] alienated from him, or, in defect of self insight, see him not in the life of their souls. Emerson's, my own name, is, even now, synonymous with unbeliever, atheist, panthe- ist. So must it be, till men are wiser, purer, holier, divine. They see not into the depths of the soul. They do not ever see themselves. They are a duality. Sin has doubled them, and, losing their unity, they feel themselves no longer on[e] with the divine in the soul. Verily, they have tripled the soul, and [486] viewing it, under this three fold aspect, name it God, man, devil, according as it hath obeyed, or violated, the moral senseT.1 &lt;of the soul.&gt; Man deifies or demonizes, his soul, and thus beholds it in its unity, or diversity, of state. Soul! Soul! Soul! This is the life and light of all beings. More or less, of this divine essence, is God, man, or demon. Apostate souls are devils, and these are men, how often: the constant soul is an angel, how few such appear in flesh! [487] CXXVII.

[492] I have enjoyed these interviewA with these simple people. They appear to have enjoyed our meetings, and expressed themselves greatly profited by them. They spoke of having them resumed again in spring. I doubt not of the good fruits. I have carried their minds over a wide circle of most vital topics, and they have had deep insight into the soul. Thirty dollars was handed me, as some return for the pleasure communicated by these descourses and conversations. Returning, I stopped and dined, on Sunday [23 December], with Mr Stetson of Medford, with whom I had pleasant talk. He doubts whether people in that place are ready for as free and full conversations as these. [493] December. Week LII. [23-31 December] CXXVIII. Dr. Follen's Second Lecture. I hea[r]d Dr. Follen's second lecture on Sunday evening [23 December]. He entered still further into the history of the Pantheistic Idea of Unity, as appearing in the systems of the New Platonists, in Bruno, and Spinoza. He gives brief speci-[494]mens of the theories of these eminent philosophers, with criticisms on their merits and defects, as men and teachers. He does not, I fancy, apprhend the vitality of the theories which he states and criticises. He is an Eclectic I should infer from his views, there seems to be wanting a principle of unity in his thoughts. He is a believer in the Duality of &lt;nature.&gt; Being, and must needs make distinctions, which do not, as I deem, exist in the absolute. The effect of his lectures will be to make men less and less inclined to favor the doctrines of [the] teacher of Nazareth. They will fix men at their own moorings, where they have anchored for centuries. We want &lt;port, and&gt; breeze[,] sail, and sea room, on the ocean of thought.</page><page sequence="58">180 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 [495] CXXIX. Sixth Conversation with Parents. Our circle this evening (Monday [24 December]) was quite full. But yet few of those present had aught to say. we conversed on Physical Culture. Diet, drink, sleep, air, exercise, bathing, were adverted to, &lt;both&gt; in their influence on the mind, disposition, and health. The retributions of the moral law, were stated at some length, and some animated talk ensued-desease, pain, infirmity, death, were regarded as consequences of sin, or violation of the law of temperance. Heredity[,] deseases, tendencies, were included also under the same general head. The Conservative nature of retribution was dwelt on, as a form of universal justice. [496] I think these people become more and more interested, as we meet from week to week. They say little, but listen, and seem to favor the views stated. I have, thus far, endeavoured to be quite practical, keeping the needs of parents in view. I have been more successful than I expected. We have adverted to general principles chiefly to establish points of practice; we have not dwelt on them too long. I believe that I have generally adapted my speech, as well as thought, to their apprehensions. This, I find is possible. I would practice this frequently. It is an important discipline. It is perfecting me in the art of speaking. I am to teach, mostly in this way. I would speak in the familiar dialect of the people. This, I am doing. [497] CXXX. Emerson's Lecture on Love. After spending the afternoon at Bartol's, with Stetson &amp; Parker, in conversation somewhat desultory, I heard Emerson's lecture at the Temple [26 December]. It was a noble and fair statement of the soul, while under the influence, or rather, in the act of love. The speaker succeeded in treating the sacred and mystic facts of love, in betrothal, marriage, friendship, without profaning, or making them vulgar. It was a great feat. His vocabulary was chaste and sweet. Blooming and flowering facts were brought before the mind, and spring time, May-day, and the life of love, were seen, aside from organs and persons. [498] The audiance was large. Good words were spoken. After the lecture I met Emerson &amp; Dwight at Bartol's, and had two hours agreeable talk with them on various literary topics. The conversation did not rise into high matters. Emerson gave me "Very's Essay on the genius of Shakespeare." I read this paper with great delight. It is one of the remarkable things of the day. It is better than any thing I have seen, aside from "Nature" and the "Growth of the Mind," of modern origin.92 I am to have another paper of his on "Hamlet." These, with the sonnets, now numbering forty, or more, Emerson proposes to publish in a volume.</page><page sequence="59">Bronson Alcott's "Journal for 1838" 181 [499] CXXXI. Persons. Emerson and Dwight made me a short visit, on Thursday morning [27 December], and we had quite general talk on matters pertaining to the new signs of life in our midst. Both seem full of life and light: both are inspired by hope. At eleven o.clock, I called on Miss M. Fuller, now on her way, from Providence, (having left the Greene Street School, under the charge of Mr. H Fuller) to Groton, where she intends spending the winter. She speaks with doubt as to the continuance of the institution, under the care of Mr. Fuller.94 I [500] fancy that her withdrawal from the school will seal its downfall. I once had some confidence in this young man. But my confidence was, I think, misplaced, and I have ceased to correspond with him. Miss F confirms all my distrusts by facts, and experiences. There is to be no institution for Spiritual Culture as yet amongst us. We are not in earnest in this matter. Some years hence, and the thing may be a fact in the history of education amongst us. We had fine talk on high topics. Miss Fuller is the most remarkable person of her sex, now extant, amongst us. Her powers &lt;of apprehension&gt; are great. As a converser, she is unsurpassed by any contemporary of my acquaintance. She is a high promise. Biography and Criticism are [501] departments in literature wherein she must distinguish herself. She is, at present, engaged in translating Goethe's Conversations with Eckermann, for "Ripley's Philosophical Miscellanies," and is to furnish, bye and bye, a life of this great German enchanter.95 Her erudition is wide, her intellect robust, her insight sharp and deep. I trust young and fresh souls are &lt;coming&gt; Trisingi to &lt;the rescue of&gt; Idivorcel our literature, from the defiling marriage which has been consummated between it ,and sensualism. The offspring of such profanation of the soul, have already &lt;left a&gt; Tbelslim&lt;y&gt;TedI &lt;track, and vulgar speech, which&gt; literature, in all its departments of religion, poetry, philosophy, art, economy&lt;, now records&gt;. Sensualism has been the parent of, I know not what, illegetimate systems in each of [502] these departments of thought and action amongst us. Out upon the bastard brood! Let us have Matter married to Spirit, as a chaste and loving bride; so shall the two become one, and all nature, and all soul, shall be hallowed. Then literature shall be pure and unspotted from the taint of this concupiscence, heredetary in the young of a past age. [503] CXXXII. Proposed Conversations at Lynn. I rode to Lynn on Friday [28 December], of this week, and saw Rev Mr Robbins of that place. I had a very agreeable interview with him. He seems a freed soul, given to thinking, and on the highest and best topics. I became interested in him from reading in the "Boston Quarterly Review" an article written by him, entitled "Thoughts on Unity, Progress and Government.""96</page><page sequence="60">182 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 He seems desposed to favour my meeting a circle for conversation in Lynn, and invited me to give an Introductory talk, at his house, on Tuesday evening, Jan 8. which I purpose doing. Little doubt is there of [504] holding a course of ten or more, as in Hingham and Lexington. I shall learn by trial, how to tempt forth the dormant life from the souls of the villagers, and make talk for them on highest and noblest topics. No discipline can be better for me than this. It brings me in direct communication with the souls of the people; and I open as it were a confessional in their hearts. I gain an insight into their needs. I learn to state the highest truths in familiar terms. It is a noble exercise in composition. It widens and popularizes my vocabulary. [505] CXXXIII Seventh Conversation on Friday Evening. The following persons were present at my room on Friday Evening [28 December]: viz: Russell, Palmer, Garrison, Norton, Frothingham, Adams." We had animated talk on the Instinct of Love. This was traced in its various phases, in childhood, youth, mature life. Opinions were various. Garrison was dogmatic, prescribing to the soul its way of acting; having small reverence for its earlier manifestations in childhood and youth; decrying as profane all romance, and ideality, subordinating this divine sentiment to the dictates of reason. [506] Other gentlemen, especially Palmer and Russell, spoke kindly and reverently of these eras of the soul. They deemed these days of romance real and beautiful. So did I, of course. Garrison, I perceive is a Goth. He slays every thing that is not strictly conformed to the Reason. All men must be reasonable at all times. So dominating is this judgement of his, that he becomes cruel, savage, in his statements, and would crush and will the affections of an imaginative, ideal, soul. His reverence is for Reason, Justice, in their sternest phases. He is unaware how he treads on the finest sentiments of the soul, by his want of sensibility to the Beautiful, the Ideall .1, &lt;in the soul.&gt; [507] CXXXIV. Seventh Conversation with Parents. I met a small circle, on &lt;Tues&gt;IMonday evening [31 December], for conversation. We resumed the subject of physical culture, and had high colloquy until 1/2 past 9 o clock. The subject deepened and broadened into its widest fact, the nature and limits of Error and Sin. Temptation, innocence, depravity, holiness, and the great facts and graces that are comprised in the phenomena and habits of sin, were considered. I gave more scope to the conversation this evening, lifting it out of details, into which it had been suffered to &lt;fall, or rather exist,&gt; Thlie at some of our former interviews. It is needful. We shall have little animated talk, without touching high and divine principles. We shall draggle &amp; [508] flounce in the mine and moats of commonplaces, until we tire of the</page><page sequence="61">Bronson Alcott's "Journal for 1838" 183 attempt to soar, and meet thus for inspiration no more. I know what I have done by this talk. I have touched delicate topics and said, free, fearless, words. Whether this circle are ready to receive them, in docility and faith, as facts of their sacred consciousness time must show. I must talk on; and talking over deep and causal principles, must dive for these, and bring them into the light, that superficial facts and phenomena, may be divined and known. This is the only way to see the facts face to face. The visible, outward, phenomenon, is but a feature of the invisible, inner, principle, wherein, as the core of the fruit, lies the seed of the fact. [509] CXXXV Close of the Year. I opened the year at Cottage Place: I close it in Beach Street. Hope is now Experience. Facts have been daily revealed to me, here in this temporal and visible life- this shadow which I cast about myself, whereby to attain insight of the substance that is and abides. The sum of this brief overflight of soul, across the domain of space, I dare not attempt to state. Only shall other and further trials and flights, cast its sum for me. I have lived:-lived at times, days, hours, minutes, during the passage of this vale around the orb of day. I have had light, heat, sight, for brief and fitful moments; and memory yet reverts to these living hours wherein I rose from the [510] sepulchres of sense, and was in God. Alas! how few and transcient, these quickenings of the divine life, in the soul! How &lt;much of the time&gt; Toften, have I been buried, and dead to the true, living, eternal, facts, that are the joy, the beatitude, the knowledge, the apotheosis, of the soul. Awake! arise! O Soul! enter into the New Year that even now is dawning into the light of thy sense. Old Time, is renewing his youth; tomorrow he is a Babe. Be thou a child also. Be meek. Let the new born nurture thee in the knowledge and love of all its disciplines of Beauty, Truth, Good. Explore its features. Divine its gifts. Grow wise. Attain to a clearer insight of the angel that is cherishing in its bosom, Thyself. Time! Time! what is time to thee? what years? what millenniums, but the ebb and flow of [511] God through thy soul, into the shows of nature; that so thou mayst chronicle the great facts within thee, for a while, upon the images and objects of the senses! Space! space, is but the flexile self that thou art, ever shaping to thee Idols of thy thought, in its objects, that so thou mayst catch some glimpse of thy great nature, by beholding thy shadow! Penetrate through the world of things, into the world of thoughts, and thence, into the innermost life of instincts. Live in thy love. Come back to thyself. Retreat into life. Strive not to dally with the toys of things, with the shadowy, spectral, images of mere thought, wherein life is not, save as thou dost animate them. Act! Act! act from within. Put forth thyself. Will to be whole. Exist in all thy faculties. Put on the Perfect. Become the Ideal that now haunts the events of thy nature; [512] woos thee, and affrights thee, to conform thine Actual to the Ideal Beauty, that &lt;shall&gt; TwouldL make thee one with the Perfect and fair Godhead, who reveals the fullness of &lt;his and of thine own&gt; Being, in the Holy of Holies, within thy faculties, Twho is,[ enthroned on the altar of Conscience; whose Image is God; transcending, Times and Spaces; without beginning or end; Chronicle, or History.-</page><page sequence="62">184 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 APPENDIX ALCOTT'S RUNNING HEADS (June-December) [259] [blank]; [260] Ministry of Education in Boston; [261] Extracts from a Letter; [262] Ministry to Parents; [263] [blank]; [264] Anticipation; [265] [blank]; [266] Action!

Who was leading this effort to secure Alcott such a ministry is not known. 9. In her letter to Alcott of 2 May 1838, Sarah Clarke (1808-96) included excerpts from her brother James Freeman Clarke's letter to her regarding the Ministry at Large in Louisville. Clarke (1810-88), a Unitarian minister and editor of the Western Messenger, was an avid supporter of Alcott's educational reforms. Not included in the selection recorded in Alcott's journal is Clarke's fear that his friend would not be happy in the West: "but [I] am afraid he would miss things that he loves. No Transcendentalism or Emersonianism here." A complete copy of Sarah Clarke's letter is in Alcott's "Autobiog- raphy 1834" (MH "59M-306 [22]). 10. Alcott's wife, Abba (1800-77), had not yet fully recovered from a miscarriage she suffered earlier in the year (Madelon Bedell, The Alcotts: Biography of a Family [New York: Clarkson N. Potter, 1980], pp. 142-43). 11. Both were Unitarian ministers: William Ellery Channing (1780-1842), who helped Alcott start the Temple School but later withdrew his support over the uproar caused by Conversations with Children on the Gospels, served as pastor of Boston's Federal Street Church from 1803 until his death; John Sullivan Dwight (1813-93) was an itinerant preacher. 12. One of the organizers of the American Institute of Instruction and an editor of the American Journal of Education, William Russell (1798-1873) taught with Alcott in the Philadelphia area in the early 1830s. 13. For European interest in Alcott's educational reforms, see "Bronson Alcott's 'Journal for 1838' (Part One)," pp. 203-204. 14. Abba took Louisa May (1832-88) with her to Scituate. Anna (1831-93) and Elizabeth (1835-58) stayed with Bronson. Samuel Joseph May (1797-1871) was a Unitarian minister active in various reform movements, including education and reform. He frequently supplied moral and material support to his improvident brother-in-law. 15. As he had with Sartor Resartus and The French Revolution, Emerson had Carlyle's Critical and Miscellaneous Essays published in the United States. The Boston firm of James Munroe issued the first two volumes on 14 July 1838, the final two volumes on 1 July 1839 (The Correspondence of Emerson and Carlyle, ed. Joseph Slater [New York: Columbia University Press, 1964], pp. 16-22). Alcott's four-volume set, inscribed "A. Bronson Alcott from his friend R. W. Emerson," is at MH (*59A-97). 16. Vital Records of Scituate, Massachusetts, to the Year 1850 lists several people named James; which one Alcott stayed with is unknown. 17. Charles Brooks (1795-1872), Unitarian minister of the Third Congregational Church in Hingham, was an old friend of Alcott. Of his good friend Anna Quincy Thaxter (1796-1878) Alcott wrote: "Of the few persons known to me, there are none of simpler faith, clearer apprehension, or purer character than this lady" (Joel Myerson, "Bronson Alcott's 'Journal for 1836,"' STUDIES IN THE AMERICAN RENAISSANCE 1979, p. 55).</page><page sequence="65">Bronson Alcott's "Journal for 1838" 187 18. Visite aux &amp;coles de pauvres d'Amsterdam (Paris: Dupont &amp; cie, 1836) by Victor Cousin (1792-1867), philosopher and educational reformer. Sometime before the end of October 1837 Brooks (not Alcott) sent Cousin copies of Record of a School and Conver- sations with Children on the Gospels (Larry A. Carlson, "Bronson Alcott's 'Journal for 1837' [Part Two]," STUDIES IN THE AMERICAN RENAISSANCE 1982, p. 105). 19. Horace Mann (1796-1859) was an influential educational reformer of public education in America and served as secretary of the Massachusetts State Board of Education (1837-48). 20. Edmund Quincy Sewall (1796-1866), A.B. Harvard 1815, had earlier in the year undergone an operation at Massachusetts General Hospital to relieve pressure in his skull (Christian Register, 14 April 1838, p. 2). 21. James K. Kendall (1769-1859), A.B. Harvard 1796, had served as pastor of the First Church and Society in Plymouth since 1800. 22. On 24 May 1838 Unitarian ministers Ephraim Peabody (1807-56) and John H. Morrison (1808-96), both graduates of Harvard Divinity School, were installed as joint colleagues in the newly dedicated meeting house of the First Congregational Society in New Bedford (Edwin Stanton Hodgin, One Hundred Years of Unitarianism in New Bedford, Massachusetts [New Bedford: Vining Press, 1924], pp. 23-30). 23. A summary of the 1838 annual meeting of the American Institute of Instruction was published in the Boston Daily Advertiser on 29 August (p. 2). 24. This project may have been sponsored by Dr. John Flint (see note 56 below), one of Alcott's Temple School patrons; see Samuel J. May to Alcott, 22 August 1838 (copy in "Autobiography 1834"). 25. Rich had earlier published his views in A System of General Education; Primary, Liberal, and Supporting Itself, Prepared with Three Distinct Modes of Application. Designed Especially but not Exclusively for Females of the Middle and Less Opulent Classes: Tested by Reason and Experiment (Keene, N.H.: B. Cooke, 1835). Of his lecture at the American Institute of Instruction the Boston Daily Advertiser wrote: "The Rev. Ezekiel Rich of Troy, in New Hampshire, equally known by his benevolent schemes and his eccentricities, rose to read a lecture on Oral Instruction, and amused his audiance for about an hour with a minute description of an Institution, destined particularly for infant orphans, which he had carried on for several years" (29 August, p. 2). At a later date Alcott added at the bottom of this page: "Passed his town, June 1841, and learned from his neighbors that he was a ruined man." 26. Orson Fowler (1809-87) and his brother Lorenzo (1811-96) frequently toured New England. Lorenzo, who had recently been in Lowell (Lowell Advertiser, 20 August, p. 2), may have been the one who examined Alcott's head. The Fowlers' contributions to the pseudoscience of phrenology are discussed by John D. Davies in Phrenology, Fad and Science: A 19th-Century American Crusade (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1955), pp. 46-64. Silas Jones analyzed Alcott's head in November 1835 ("Journal for 1835," MH *59M-308 [8], pp. 459-67). John Fletcher's examination took place in March 1838 ("Bronson Alcott's 'Journal for 1838' [Part One]," pp. 218-19). 27. Next to the Boston Association, the Cambridge Association of Congregational Ministers, of which these Unitarian clergymen (except Parker) were members, was the largest such group in the area. Previously unidentified are Convers Francis (1795-1863) of Watertown, Caleb Stetson (1793-1870) of Medford, and Theodore Parker (1810-60)</page><page sequence="66">188 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 of West Roxbury. These three were regular members of the "Symposeum," Alcott's term for the Transcendental Club. Other previously unidentified figures are Joseph Field (1788-1869) of Weston, William Barry (1805-85) of Framingham, William Gray Swett (1808-43) of Lexington, William Newell (1804-81) of Cambridge, Artemus Muzzey (1802-92) of Cambridgeport, and Barzillai Frost (1804-58) of Concord. 28. Emerson's Divinity School Address was delivered on 15 July. For a perceptive analysis of why the Address proved so controversial, see Robert D. Habich, "Emerson's Reluctant Foe: Andrews Norton and the Transcendental Controversy," New England Quarterly, 65 (June 1992): 208-37. 29. Sarah Alden Bradford Ripley (1793-1867) was the wife of Reverend Samuel Ripley (1783-1847), Emerson's uncle. Perhaps the most learned woman in all of New England at the time, she had early in life mastered Latin, Greek, French, and Italian. She and her husband kept school at Waltham, tutoring generations of students bound for and studying at Harvard. When Edward Everett was president at Harvard, he claimed that she could fill any professor's chair (Francis W. Knickerbocker, "Sarah Alden Bradford Ripley," in Notable American Women: 1607-1950, 3 vols. [Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1971], 3:166). 30. On 28 September the Liberator published a summary of the meeting of the New England Peace Convention (pp. 2-3). The article listed those who attended, and it printed the Declaration of Sentiments. 31. [Orestes A. Brownson], "Alcott on Human Culture," Boston Quarterly Review, 1 (October 1838): 417-32. Brownson (1803-76) was an old friend and distant relative of Alcott. 32. Alcott's advertisement ran in the Christian Register from 29 September to 10 November (p. 3). 33. Emerson's ten lectures given in his series entitled "Human Life" were delivered at the Masonic Temple from 5 December 1838 to 20 February 1839. For the texts of these lectures see The Early Lectures of Ralph Waldo Emerson, ed. Stephen E. Whicher, Robert E. Spiller, and Wallace E. Williams, 3 vols. (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1959-72), 2:1-171. 34. That is, his Divinity School Address, delivered on 15 July. 35. The persons whom Alcott associates with these fads and pseudosciences are unknown. 36. English Transcendentalist and reformer, James Pierrepont Greaves (1777-1842) read Alcott's works with great interest and had first written him in September 1837. Greaves established, near London, the Alcott House, an experimental school inspired by Alcott's educational theories and practices. Because of the uproar caused by the first two volumes of the Conversations, a third volume was never published. William Oldham (1790-1879), a close friend of Greaves, handled business matters at Alcott House. For further information about Greaves and Oldham, see Joel Myerson, "William Harry Harland's 'Bronson Alcott's English Friends,'" Resources for American Literary Study, 7 (Spring 1978): 24-60. 37. Greaves had studied under the noted Swiss educator Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi (1746-1827). Wingman[?] is unidentified as is his book. Alcott's copy of John Minter Morgan's Hampden in the Nineteenth Century (London: Moxon, 1834) is at MH (*59A-</page><page sequence="67">Bronson Alcott's "Journal for 1838" 189 387). The person from whom Alcott received Morgan's Colloquies on Religion and Religious Education (London: Moxon, 1837) is probably Elijah Pope Clark (1791-1859), the cashier of the Bank of New England and avid reader of books, especially those by Carlyle (Correspondence of Emerson and Carlyle, pp. 27, 347). 38. Greaves, Three Hundred Maxims (London: Sherwood, Gilbert &amp; Piper, 1827); Kelty, Spiritual Fragments (London, 1838); Psychological Speculations (London: Bur- gess and Hill, 1827), author(s) unknown; Heraud, Substance of a Lecture (London: J. Fraser, 1837); Platonic Parables (London: Published for the Society, 1837), author(s) unknown. 39. Because of his despair over the failure of the Temple School, Alcott did not write to Greaves until 26 April 1839, the same day that he wrote to London bookseller Richard J. Kennett, to whom Alcott's publisher, James Munroe, had sent books in the fall of 1837 (Frederick Wagner, "Eighty-Six Letters [1814-1882] of A. Bronson Alcott [Part One]," STUDIES IN THE AMERICAN RENAISSANCE 1979, pp. 302-307). Whether Alcott ever wrote to Morgan (1782-1854), a miscellaneous writer, is unknown. 40. Pasted on both sides of the leaf containing pages 341-42 is a printed advertise- ment for "Pestalozzian School, Conducted by Mr. Dyne." According to the announce- ment Dyne had studied "many years at Paris, Florence, and Berlin, where, as well as in England, he has had every advantage of witnessing these modes of Instruction and their successful results." He is probably J. G. Dyne, author of Remarks on Education; with a few suggestions for its improvements, and an outline of the plan pursued at Bolton house school, Turnham Green (London: Drewett, 1840). At the top of p. 341 Alcott wrote: "(Sent by Mr. Greaves of London.)". 41. The first of Combe's sixteen lectures on "the science of Phrenology as connected with Education, Legislature, &amp;c." was delivered on 10 October (Boston Courier, 10 October, p. 3). Combe (1788-1858) was best known for his Constitution of Man Consid- ered in Relation to External Objects (Edinburgh: J. Anderson, 1828), which Alcott first read in 1829 (Frederick C. Dahlstrand, Amos Bronson Alcott, p. 81). 42. Johann Gaspar Spurzheim (1776-1832) was a pioneering phrenologist under whom Combe had studied.
