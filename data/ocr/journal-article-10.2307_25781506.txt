<plain_text><page sequence="1">BECKETT, GERMAN FASCISM, AND HISTORY: The Futility of Protest James McNaughton Accessing his letters and German diaries, this article argues that Beckett changes his aesthetic response to the rise of fascism during and after his trip to Nazi Germany in 1936-37. Before the trip Beckett satirises a stereotypical modernism's inability to counter the rise of totalitarianism; when confronted with Nazi totalising narratives of art and history, however, Beckett reevaluates the capacity of modernism to frustrate increasingly irrational fascist narratives. He even posits his German diaries as a documentary alternative to fascist histories. Not until he returns, however, does Beckett manage to formulate in his creative work a satisfying aesthetic response. What I want is the straws, flotsam, etc., names, dates, births &amp; deaths, because that is all I can know. [...] Meier says the background is more important than the foreground, the causes than the effects, the causes than their representatives and opponents. I say the background &amp; the causes are an inhuman and incomprehensible machinery &amp; venture to wonder what kind of appetite it is that can be appeased by the modern animism that consists in rationalising them.* (German Diaries, Notebook 4, 15 Jan 1937)1 In October 1936, Samuel Beckett arrived in Nazi Germany to view the collections of modernist art and to practice German. He planned to stay eight months, "if Europe," he commented ominously in a letter to confidant Thomas MacGreevy, "has not been obliterated before then" (9 Oct 1936).2 In the years before the trip, Beckett warily watched the rise of fascism. His uncle Boss Sinclair, a Jewish art collector, fled</page><page sequence="2">102 James McNaughton Germany in 1933 "with not much more than pyjamas &amp; toothbrushes," and when in the same year the style of fascist politics showed up in Ireland, Beckett denounced Irish politician W.T. Cosgrave as "Cockatoo Cosgrave arrayed as a Fascist" (SB to TM, 7 Sept 1933).3 The long sojourn in Germany crystallised Beckett's growing awareness of fascism's destructive logic and led him to formulate an aesthetic response that differed from that in his early work. In his first published fiction More Pricks than Kicks (1934), Beckett dramatises a critique of modernism articulated by Wyndham Lewis that claimed modernism would facilitate political catastrophe by foolishly associating freedom with the abandonment of cause-and-effect logic and rational analysis. When in Germany, however, Beckett changes his position. He brags that he himself lacks historical sense and he insists on the rational integrity of recognising historical and individual chaos. Beckett's reaction emerges in response to Nazi fascist totalising narratives of Germanic destiny in both political and aesthetic histories. The German compulsion to narrate history as the destiny of the German race led Nazi ideology to rationalise contradictions to that destiny and failures of the state with illogical causes, including Jewishness and modernism. Such is Beckett's disgust with sweeping historical narratives that he fashions his German diaries as a counterexample to cause-and-effect rationality: he lists obsessively, often without any syntactical connection, endless documentary facts, performing a private protest against the type of history he detests. Yet Beckett himself recognises the absurdity of a documentary diary that, while a political act of a kind, lacks the rational judgments and audience that might make it meaningful. Not until after the trip does Beckett find a way in his creative work to reconcile his early conviction that abandoning historical sense and cause-and-effect judgment represents a political liability and his later awareness that rationalising the chaos of history can generate dangerously irrational historical narratives that lead to censorship and war. Beckett's declarations when he returns from Germany that his creative writing will investigate rational mysticism or focus on a critique of language represent one attempt at reconciliation. So does the transformation and repression of cultural tragedies into cliches across his work, a performative erasure of history that permits, he suggests, irrational histories to shape perceptions of historical reality in the first place. Comparing the treatment of European politics in Beckett's early fiction with his attitudes first in Germany and then when he returns</page><page sequence="3">Beckett, German Fascism, and History 103 reveals the growing contradictions for modernists formulating a response to the rise of fascism. In his first set of short stories More Pricks than Kicks, Beckett often delivers political references as quips, which leave European politics seeming far from the pseudo-intellectual salons and streets of Dublin where the stories are set. Into this category fall the fight between the "communist painter" and the "labour man," the "rubber Stalin" wit impervious to rejoinder, and the joke about the French Prime Minister who refuses to fall into step with the extreme right without knowing first what they are stepping in (72-3, 144, 155). Yet the book also deploys dark allegories that warn against treating Irish culture as separate from European developments. For instance, in the story "Walking Out," the protagonist of the collection Belacqua heads out to spy on lovers in the woods. On his trip his fiancee Lucy rides up to him upon her jennet, suggestive of "Nobel Yeats" (144). Yeats's Nobel Prize lecture, delivered to the Royal Academy of Sweden in 1923, parallels praise for Lady Gregory's patronage of the theatre in Ireland with admiration for the "splendid spectacle" of the Swedish court, which - unlike the institutions of English and "American Democracy" in Ireland - promotes "discipline" and "taste" (Yeats, 418). Astride her horse, Belacqua's girlfriend recalls the Protestant Ascendancy and presumably something of Yeats's proto fascist comments. Moments later Beckett slams into the horse "a superb silent limousine, a Daimler no doubt, driven by a drunken lord" (118). Lucy is crippled; the beast expires "in the twilight" (118). Yeats's high horse aristocratic fantasies and embarrassing fascist sympathies, well known when Beckett revises this story, meet the futuristic violence of German technology - a grim warning of the irresponsibility fascism entails. This technique - labeling a character with an allusion to a political position - makes so sharp a shortcut to allegory that the political critique appears as overt as it is tenuous. Nevertheless, Beckett's warning seems clear. Beckett has more artistic success when he employs this type of allegory to examine the optimism among some in his Parisian circle that claimed avant-garde experimentation and assault on rational thought would somehow counter the grim political catastrophe developing in Europe. With Belacqua, the indolent aesthete protagonist of More Pricks than Kicks, Beckett examines modernist claims that aesthetic experiment could amount to political responsibility. As early as 1929, Wyndham Lewis had accused those associated with the journal transition of naively responding to the rise of totalitarianism by</page><page sequence="4">104 James McNaughton celebrating irrationality and foolishly insinuating that verbal revolution would result in revolution proper. For Lewis the important revolution was technological, "the new conditions of gas and aerial-warfare" that would be deployed against "the sleeping citizens" of all nations and thereby make any revolutionary victory pyrrhic (91). By abandoning reason, he claimed, and associating freedom with intellectual flux and non-conceptualised experience in the tradition of Henri Bergson, modernists sacrificed the one tool that might prevent war, which was reason itself. Though Beckett's first assignment in Paris was to validate Joyce's Work in Progress in the face of Wyndham Lewis's attacks, by the time he writes his stories Beckett takes Lewis's ideas more seriously. Beckett dramatises Lewis's political critique of a stereotypical modernism with his protagonist Belacqua. Belacqua is a caricature of the type of modernist-aesthete who tries to shirk habit and live in a flux of sensation and rich aesthetic consumption. He boycotts rational and political thought, and shudders at the thought of a "big idea or petition" intruding on his aesthetic pleasures. This Bergsonian cannot tolerate a clock in his house, preferring to live in a state where time is not measured, and he avoids the "bosthoons of his own class in case they foist a big idea on him, forcing him, perhaps, to conceptualise his experience" (15). Moreover, he has no historical sense. Another character accuses him of "sandpapering tomb[s]," erasing history like Beckett's postwar fiction is said to do (30). And without the capacity for remembering, he tends to repress or forget the tragedies that occur around him, after he enjoys witnessing them. Belacqua lacks the capacity for cause-and-effect rational analysis and so the same events threaten to recur. Oblivious to the logic that states the same cause will produce the same effect, Belacqua drives recklessly on the street where earlier he witnessed a tenement waif get run over. And Beckett expands to the cultural domain of crime and punishment this theme that enjoying the aesthetic spectacle, rather than understanding its cause, allows it to repeat. Belacqua pities the real-life gardener McCabe in the first story because he will be executed by the Irish state. Yet, Belacqua refuses to sign the petition to spare his life, and in the last story McCabe's own supposed crime replays in Belacqua's life when his gardener rapes his maid and burns down his house. Just as Lewis would warn about the war, failing to rationally conceptualise experience - either individual actions or the cultural habits of crime and punishment - allows events to recur.</page><page sequence="5">Beckett, German Fascism, and History 105 Belacqua's Bergsonian characteristics become an excuse for utter irresponsibility, existential apathy, and political naivete. Eventually his attitudes lead to violent punishment, a scene which Beckett overlays with dark overtones that suggest his political concerns. In the story "Yellow" Belacqua's typically modernist distrust of reason leads to a warning about fascism and Stalinism. Belacqua must undergo an operation to remove a tumour, but the entire episode is narrated as if Belacqua will be tortured and executed. To keep out the idea of being exterminated, Belacqua adopts, the narrator tells us, the strategy of the Stalinist clowns, Bim and Bom: with laughter he will destroy the pernicious idea of administered terror: "He would arm his mind with laughter [...] then he would admit the idea and blow it to pieces" (177). Belacqua uses good-humour as a coping mechanism, a strategy that ultimately implicates him in his own death. The Russian clowns, as Beckett knew, were reportedly the only two allowed to criticise Stalin's harsh policies, the better to diffuse dissent. Stalinist overtones mix with German references, and when Belacqua steps smartly, "ohne Hast aber ohne Rast, into the torture chamber," he is gassed to death by a drunken doctor (177). Beckett pulls off the scene with great comedy, but the narrator's political overlay implies that by banishing his own rational dissent Belacqua acquiesces to another abuse of technological power, associated again with German technological efficiency. Before the journey through Germany in 1936, as these episodes from More Pricks than Kicks suggest, Beckett implies that the modernist celebration of irrationality can lead to a naive acceptance of, and even complicity with, administered fate. The trip to Nazi Germany changes Beckett's relationship with modernism to the point that he brags that he possesses Bergsonian characteristics similar to those he satirises in Belacqua. Whereas Belacqua reveals the dangerous irresponsibility of abandoning historical sense and banishing ideas and conceptual reason, in Germany Beckett claims that he himself has no sense of history and he stresses the importance of recognising the fallibility of cause-and-effect logic. Beckett casts himself as heroic modernist; he appears reluctant to analyse politically his experience in Germany; and he puts forth as a virtue his inability to conceptualise art, history, and literature with master-narratives. He vows never to write another piece of literary criticism again. He casts away the process of intellectualising and contextualising artwork with language: "I'm afraid I couldn't write about pictures at all," he writes to MacGreevy about his work on Jack</page><page sequence="6">106 James McNaughton B. Yeats. "I used never to be happy with a picture till it was literature, but now that need is gone" (28 Nov 1936). He calls the historical circumstances that lead to the creation of an artwork a 'fable convenue" and rails against literary critics who "in the phrase of Bergson can't be happy till they have 'solidified the flowing'" by assimilating a work into historicised cause-and-effect categories of thought (31 Jan 1938). Beckett portrays himself as possessing a pure modernist and anachronistic sensibility - Bergson's duree - that cannot categorise, for instance, paintings by their historical placement in time or school, but only experience them as a mode of singular particular perception. "You have said it often enough," Beckett brags to MacGreevy; "no sense of history" (4 Sept. 1937). In German thinking, historical perceptions were often colored by the conviction that history and art were, if not identical then at least matching developments that mutually influenced one another (Grosshans). In response to the German tendency to make art serve nationalist ends, to fuse racial purity and cultural homogeneity, Beckett posits his inability to see any connection whatsoever between historic circumstances and artistic production. Beckett's aesthetic pronouncements respond to the politics of culture and history in Germany, which made an enemy out of modernism because it violated Hitler's mandate that art unify and order a people based on racial grounds. Notoriously, Hitler's hatred achieved its sensational articulation in the opening speech of the "House of German Art" in Munich, which he had built to house his ideal classical collection. Hitler excoriated modernist art, whose infamy was illustrated in the famous Entartete Kunst Sachandausstellungen, which opened the next day down the street. Beckett missed the speech, but Hitler's rhetoric, much like the periodic shame-exhibits themselves, was a terminus on a track already well laid. Hitler extols the virtue of clarity in art: "The most beautiful law which I can envisage for my people" is, "[t]o be German is to be clear." And emphatically he dismisses the fashions of European modernism: "every year something new," he says, "[o]ne day Impressionism, then Futurism, Cubism, and maybe even Dadaism" (Hitler, 476). Germany needs "an art which reflects their growing racial unification and, thus, the portrayal of a well-rounded, total character" (478).4 Beckett, to his great disappointment could not view much of the modern art because it was censored to the cellars and rounded up to be mocked in the shame</page><page sequence="7">Beckett, German Fascism, and History 107 exhibit. And, in the fuller excerpt of this article's epigraph, Beckett makes his antipathy for Hitler's clarity and unity obvious: I am not interested in a "unification" of the historical chaos any more than I am in the "clarification" of the individual chaos, &amp; still less in the anthropomorphisation of the inhuman necessities that provoke the chaos. What I want is the straws, flotsam, etc., names, dates, births and deaths [....] I say the background &amp; the causes are inhuman and incomprehensible machinery &amp; venture to wonder what kind of appetite it is that can be appeased by the modern animism that consists in rationalising them. [...] I want the old fashioned history book of reference, not the fashionable monde romance that explains copious[ly] why e.g. Luther was inevitable without telling me anything about Luther, where he went next, what he lived on, what he died of, etc. I say the expressions "historical necessity" &amp; "Germanic destiny" start the vomiting moving upwards. (Notebooks 15 Jan 1937) In letters, Beckett evaluates modernist landscape painting in similar terms - by how successfully the artist avoids animising and anthropomorphising the landscape.5 Here Beckett applies his aesthetic concerns to narrative forms that support fascist "historical necessity" and "Germanic destiny." No longer satirising modernism's limitations in responding to the rise of fascism, as Lewis proposed, Beckett appears more concerned with confronting the narrative logic of fascism itself, especially as it employs art to interpret history. The aesthetic response which makes no attempt to "clarify" individual or historical chaos, he implies, represents a logical alternative to fascist narratives. Rejecting the logic of "Germanic destiny," particularly as it necessitates the fabrication of causes that Beckett finds irrational, also highlights Beckett's concern with anti-Semitism. In Germany the "anthropomorphisation of the inhuman necessities that provoke the chaos" was in its worst allegorical simplification the Jew, who was the necessary scapegoat for a rational system of history that could not reconcile Germany's supposedly divine "Germanic destiny" with its egregious historical failures, such as losing World War I. Beckett's reading of the monde romance Mein Kampf- his personal copy was by 1941 "well-thumbed" and "heavily underlined" (Bair, 314) - would have revealed this to him; as would his familiarity with "Jewbaiting</page><page sequence="8">108 James McNaughton Streicher and his rag" (SB to TM, 7 March 1937) - a reference to Julius Streicher, editor of the anti-Semitic journal Der Sturmer who would later be hanged at the Nuremberg Trials for his Nazi propaganda; as would his knowledge of "the I. B. (Illustrierter Beobachter) mentality &amp; the Schwarzen Korps ... mentality," the former the Nazi Party's illustrated newspaper, the latter the newspaper of the S.S. (Notebook 4, 11 Jan 1937). Beckett suggests that sticking to the facts - "straws, flotsam, etc., names, dates, births and deaths" - avoids at least the illogic of searching for rational causes that, given the assumptions of Germanic racial destiny, become irrational. Indeed, Beckett styles his German diary as a documentary exemplar to protest the idealised historical narratives he loathes. He models his notebooks after the type of history that he opposed to the monde romance, "the old fashioned history book of reference." Hundreds of pages of quotidian material, often free from syntactical connection, make the text often seem more antiquarian in its documentation than reflective. He lists every book he receives, notes the paintings in almost every gallery he visits, draws maps of streets and the museum complex in Berlin; and though the notebooks do not lack long reflective meditations, they are more remarkable for their lists of hard facts. Here is Beckett recounting a typical day in Hamburg: out for walk: Biischstr., Gerhofstr., Konigstr., Poststr., A.H. Platz, Johannistr.[s/c], Burstah, Hopfenmarkt, Deichstr. (where fire broke out in 1842. Saw Kneipe Zum-Brand-Anfang), Hohe Br., Cremon, Catharinestr., Catharinenstr., Grimm, Zollenbr., Brodschrangen, Kl. Johannisstr., where at corner of Schauenburgerstr. dived into Weinhaus Rheinpflaz &amp; drank 5/20 litre of 1935er [...] Leistadter Kirchenstiick Riesling Spatlese, much better [....] Then on to Deutschlandhaus, when loudspeaker blaring A[dolf] H[itler] &amp; Goebbels opining Winterhilfswerk in Berlin - Apoplexy. They must fight soon (or burst). (Notebook 1, 6 Oct 1936) Beckett records "where he went next, what he lived on" without skipping a street name. The stunning collection of nouns - made more surprising because Beckett has listed most of these street names in entries just days before - rarely receives anything like syntactical connection or logical analysis. This obsessive documentation relents in rare moments, such as at the end of this citation, to reveal what</page><page sequence="9">Beckett, German Fascism, and History 109 motivates the documentary protest against "historical necessity," namely, approaching war. To make the future prediction, Beckett turns to the convenient anthropomorphic shorthand that he critiques above. "Apoplexy" - the loss of consciousness caused by a brain hemorrhage - suggests both that Hitler's and Goebbels' rhetoric leads to the loss of consciousness among the listeners and that Hitler and Goebbels are themselves the body politic rising to such a fever pitch that they will have a stroke if they do not launch war: "they must fight soon (or burst)." Allegory, folding into the leaders the national populace, makes easy shape of the historical chaos and shows that at the moment of critique Beckett is forced into self-contradiction. In a revealing passage, Beckett acknowledges the futility of his documentary endeavour and he reapplies the old critique of Bergsonian modernism to his own diary. With more self-pity than comedy Beckett recognises that failing to analyse his observations and abandoning rational interpretation threatens meaninglessness: The little trouble I give myself, this absurd diary with its lists of pictures, serves no purpose, is only the act of an obsessional neurotic. Counting pennies would do as well. An "open mindedness" that is mindlessness, the sphincter of the mind limply for ever open, the mind past the power of closing itself to everything but its own content, or rather its own treatment of a content. / have never thought for myself I have switched off the incipient thought in terror for so long that I couldn't think now for half-a minute if my life (!) depended on it. (Notebook 4, 2 Feb 1937) By failing to offer "treatment of a content," by being unable to analyse rationally the record of his observations, Beckett acknowledges that what at first appears an alternative to rationalised historical narratives "serves no purpose" and is "absurd." In this self-conscious moment Beckett recognises his purposelessness as an unknown writer writing what would be until after his death an unknown diary, unable to get beyond the dead-end of confronting fascism's application of providential "rational" history with a private attempt to overwhelm categories with long series of "mindless" details. His equation of "'open-mindedness'" with "mindlessness" echoes Lewis's critiques of a Bergsonian modernism that foolishly equates mental flux and lack of</page><page sequence="10">110 James McNaughton categorisation with freedom and resistance to rational control. This moment puts Beckett back where he began in his critique of Belacqua. Like his character to whom he alludes, Beckett claims he has switched off thought in horror, and could not think even if his "life (!) depended on it." The parenthetical exclamation shows Beckett's self-pity and his impotence in the face of coming war; it also inflates the stakes of thought to the black-comedic level of More Pricks Than Kicks, where the refusal to think makes the character complicit in his own death. That Beckett recognises listing documentary fact as a meaningless gesture and perhaps even a failed attempt to expose the irrationality of fascist logic engages an aesthetic and political debate in the 1930s. By 1937 realistic documentation had become a popular method of confronting fascist propaganda. We see it in England with the increased popularity of documentary film, the success of the Left Book Club, and even the publication journal called Fact, a socialist monthly that hoped to change consciousness and effect action by transmitting factual information. Yet in the face of fascist propaganda, particularly as its ideology anthropomorphised contradiction with virulent anti-Semitism, facts alone could not counter the mythic narratives. Slavoj Zizek concludes a similar line of thought by noting "the proper answer to anti-Semitism is therefore not 'Jews are really not like that' but 'the anti-Semitic idea of the Jew has nothing to do with Jews; the ideological figure of a Jew is a way to stitch up the inconsistency of our own ideological system'" (48). I have posited that Beckett's disgust with a rationalism that anthropomorphises chaos argues this very point. Anti-Semitism helps to square the circle of Germany's providential racial "destiny" and its historic failures such as losing World War I. Beckett confirms this again in another rare moment of political analysis in his diary. He agrees with his new friend Axel Kaun's assessment that Nazi Germany's propaganda has been terribly effective, which leads the diary to speculate on the appropriate Jewish response: [Axel Kaun] [...] analyze[s] the new Germany as one half sentimental demagogies and one half the brilliant obscurantics of Dr. Gfoebbels], who he declares counts for more in what has been "achieved" than all the others put together, with which I can comfortably agree. He deplores the failure of the Jews in exile to establish a spiritual criticism &amp; the futility of their protest against the inessential. The communistic view that Dr. G. is at all costs to be encouraged as he is the USSR's best advocate in Germany!</page><page sequence="11">Beckett, German Fascism, and History 111 Certainly he is a pupil of their technique. All refreshing from Prussian or is it Saxon lips. (Notebooks 11 Jan 1937) Beckett appears refreshingly pleased to record Kaun's analysis because he agrees with it. Though Kaun's terms are somewhat opaque, "the futility of ...protest against the inessential" likely describes a type of criticism that contradicts myth with fact but fails to diagnose the ideological shape of thought, what Kaun calls "spiritual criticism." The vagueness of the term "spiritual criticism" indicates the trickiness of responding aesthetically to fascism, a trickiness highlighted by Beckett's contradictory responses before and after his trip. Belacqua's laughter which attempts to destroy reason and political thought and Beckett's philosophical skepticism which attempts to disassociate historical facts from the narratives that irrationally shape them both fail, by Beckett's own estimation, as modes of critique. They appear a mere coping mechanism to face violence in the one case and an "absurd" response to an ideology that can embrace factual contradiction in the other. This oscillation from satirising a character who foolishly abandons conceptual reason, to himself refusing to provide coherent interpretive narratives - whether literary, historical, or biographical - indicates an impasse that Beckett's creative work attempts to resolve. Beckett appears caught in a paradox: on the one hand, without memory and the capacity to rationalise the past, the present cannot be understood and the same events threaten to repeat. On the other hand, he rejects causes and background and finds the rationalisation of them intellectually dishonest and politically dangerous. Far from making him an ahistorical writer, as Beckett's critical reputation often has him, this paradox reveals Beckett caught between the fear of forgetting the past and greater fear of rationally misshaping it. Beckett's diaries expose both aspects of this dilemma: he obsessively documents paintings and street names before a war that threatens, as Beckett wrote to MacGreevy, to obliterate Europe entirely. Indeed, though the diaries provide a failed alternative to the excessively rational forms of "Germanic destiny" with the "obsessional neuros[is]" of their mindless content, they reveal Beckett's concern about the preservation of cultural memory. The loss of history, in other words, appears as problematic as its formal misapplication. If Beckett's private letters and diaries appear caught in the simultaneous necessity and dangerous absurdity of giving historical</page><page sequence="12">112 James McNaughton content a form, his creative work more deftly manages the paradox. When he returns from Germany Beckett's creative writing addresses two interrelated yet contradictory problems. First, he turns to a critique of language to expose precisely the transcendental notions such as "Germanic destiny" or "historical necessity." Second, he begins to dramatise across his works the process by which the content of history becomes voided, repressed, and forgotten. Beckett articulates the former in his famous German letter to Axel Kaun where he claims that official English appears to him "like a veil that must be torn apart in order to get at the things (or nothingness) behind it." The less quoted but funnier version comes out in a letter to Mary Manning at the same time: Austin Clarke is starting a verse speaking society. With Padraig Fallon &amp; all the little N.U. girls. I asked one was it to be alfresco &amp; she left the room - / am starting a Logoclast's League. May I count on your support? I am the only member at present. The idea is mystical writing, so that the void may protrude like a hernia. (SB to MM, 16Feb 1937)6 Beckett opposes the socialite value of Irish literary culture with his own Logoclast League, a mocking revision of the Irish nationalist Gaelic League. He performs as the misogynist avant-garde writer to distance himself and his art from any national affiliation. Far from expressions of historical and political disengagement, however, Beckett's "mystical writing" would be better understood as the "spiritual criticism" mentioned by Axel Kaun, particularly as it tries to expose the ideological distortions of the historical "void." Making the "void...protrude like a hernia" represents a desire to reveal the linguistic and narrative methods by which fascism shapes historical data. To tear language apart often means exposing the ideological imperatives built into it, the assumption of authority, and the manipulation of fate. Revelations like this occur in Beckett's work all the time. On the minor linguistic level in "L'Expulse," for instance, the narrator's father promises him a hat: "Viens, mon fils, nous allons acheter ton chapeau, comme s'il preexistait dupuis l'eternite dans un endroit determine" (1958, 14).7 This trick of the possessive case that</page><page sequence="13">Beckett, German Fascism, and History 113 gives transcendental eternity to a hat is a typically bathetic example. But semantic games also establish the transcendental authority of Watt's colonial landlord Mr. Knott or Didi and Gogo's Godot, whose captivating authority commands servitude in the one case and paralysis in the other. Both of these entities are versions of "hernias in a void," that is, transcendental projections of language and ideology that necessitate seemingly rational behavioural responses. Friedrich Nietzsche wrote "I am afraid we are not rid of God because we still have faith in grammar" (483). This old existential problem reappears in Beckett's work, energised by the historical fact that it has become a political problem: language grants perilous "thinghood" to the chaos of history and affects political policies and citizens' actions. Though more than a political enterprise, Beckett's assault on language has these pointed benefits of exposing the power of narrative forms that make certain conclusions appear necessary - submitting to the quasi colonialism in Watt, waiting endlessly for Godot, sacrificing your life to the state, buying the hat. Not only does Beckett expose such linguistic mystifications, but he also evokes allegorical schemas used to explain historical progress, only to make a farce of their persistence as explanations. Beckett states his objection as his incomprehensibility of the "anthropomorphisation of the inhuman necessities that provoke the chaos," what we might call historical allegory. When history is anthropomorphised into a schema such as the master and servant relationships in Watt, Godot, and Endgame - a schema long associated in German philosophical tradition with a universal rational historical process - the form persists but the rational and explanatory value of the form has been spent. If Beckett's work reveals how language creates spurious "hernias," he is also interested in how the "void" itself is created. However much his work unhinges causes from effects and removes realistic background that would help us contextualise his characters or landscapes, Beckett self-consciously demands that the reader consider the cost of forgetting and repressing history. Read serially, Beckett's work re-echoes events again and again, pushing them further into cliche and metaphor to examine how history and historical trauma become assimilated and forgotten. In the first story of More Pricks than Kicks, to which I referred above, Beckett fictionalises the real-life state execution of Henry McCabe, a gardener who was charged with killing an entire household and burning down their house when Beckett was a student at Trinity. This was the most significant mass murder in</page><page sequence="14">114 James McNaughton twentieth-century Ireland - mass murder, that is, without even the shadow-dignity of political motivations. The McCabe affair itself could be seen as a de-politicised echo of the scores of Anglo-Irish big houses burned down only four years before. In the last story of the published collection Beckett co-opts the details of Henry McCabe's crime for Belacqua's own life, where his gardener rapes his maid and burns down his house; and in Watt, written ten years later, the details of that historical event surface eerily in metaphor, where the gardener repeats again and again that he gets on with his wife "like a house on fire" (144). By this point Ireland's most sensational murders had long been forgotten but still linger in Beckett's text. This process of first fictionalising a historical event, co-opting it for his characters, and then subsuming it into cliche, demands we re-question the assumption that Beckett's fiction is a negative of reality, or that it ignores it altogether. When Beckett's work is read serially, in other words, his increasing focus on language's formal and epistemological failures is not without an examination of the costs. Beckett shows across his works how language gradually makes historical content - the historical facts of violence, in this case in Ireland - an empty cognitive form. This process of converting content into abstract cliche erases or represses memory and creates Beckett's void that presumably gives the fascist misshapes or "hernias" space to emerge. Beckett refuses to be compelled into error by the "prejudice of reason that forces us to posit identity, permanence, substance, cause, thinghood, being," as Nietzsche put the old problem long before. But neither does he fail to reveal how language, by its increased abstraction and move to facile conceptualisation, bleaches memory and, as Beckett puts it in Watt, "turnfs] a disturbance...into a pillow of old words" (115).
