<plain_text><page sequence="1">Some notes on epiphany Mysteres de l'instant ANTHONY GRITTEN continues the debate about the nature of the listening experience IN THE LAST ISSUE of this journal Arnold Whittall wrote about what he saw as 'some musicological disputes'. Introducing the sus- pects in his drama, the first part of his paper was a thinly disguised roman a clef, with myself as the guilty protagonist. Named later on, Whittall went on to detail some apparent absurdities in my writing for which I am to blame, and a few rather unfair remarks, for which I apologise. Whittall, too, though, is guilty of several misun- derstandings, small and large, and these ought to be mentioned. The problem I have with 'Whittall's way' (as the journal's cover advertised it) and the wider approach it represents is neither with its post- Adornian understanding of Modernism, nor es- pecially with its hermeneutic approach towards musical texts. It is, rather, with its underlying conception of the way we listen to music. Guid- ing what follows is my belief that Whittall labours under a misapprehension as to the nature of the relation between listener and music, or act and ob- ject, during performance (and, therefore, a mis- apprehension as to the relation between listening to music and writing about music): it is not a symmetrical, dialogic relation. I hope this sets the record straight. Judging by Whittall's response and the tone of his remark about 'that concept of "epiphany" so important to Gritten',' he has misunderstood the point I was trying to make about the temporal moment of musical engagement - about epiphany. Let us begin by looking at one of the points over which Whittall and I seem to disagree: our un- derstanding of 'the symbiosis between short-term experience and long-term reflection in which the enjoyment of music is founded' (p.8). This is my fault for not having been entirely clear, though I do wonder at the logic of this remark, specifical- ly, whether it would be kinder to speak of 'the en- joyment of music in which the symbiosis be- tween experience and reflection is founded'; maybe this marks the difference between musical listening and musicological listening. At any rate, for Whittall, 'long-term reflection' seems to mean primarily the duration between performances during which the listener may choose to spend time thinking about music and musical perfor- mances, and 'assimilating' their values.2 Some lis- teners do indeed reflect upon their musical expe- riences and even talk about them, and this often functions in an educational capacity for self-im- provement. However, what I have been con- cerned with is what, along the same lines, might be called 'short-term reflection': those moments during live performance when the listener is asked to reach beyond the sonority of the present ges- ture towards his or her memory, however unpre- pared and fallible it may be, even to question the very reliability of that memory. Thus Whittall's most important and lasting criticism (though he spends the least time on it), which is that my con- ception of the musical act ignores the role of mu- sical memory and its tendency toward ritual (p.14), is true, partially. I have ignored (long- term) memory as Whittall chooses to understand it, but this is because my focus has been on an- other element of the musical act: those moments where, despite (in fact: because of) the listener's striving towards individual autonomy, what Whittall calls the 'memory and modelling [...] which drive the interpretative engine' (p.14) fail. Those moments I have called epiphanies. Notes 1. Arnold Whittall: 'Dissenting voices: subjectivity, synthesis, and hermeneutic narrative', in The Musical Times vol.141 no.1873 (Winter 2000), p.12.

MY own preference, then, is indeed towards 'divergence', as Whittall puts it (p.9); but this is because it allows, to borrow Levinasian termino- logy, a move away from the 'totality' of a Bakhtin- ian polyphony (Whittall's model for a Modernist musicology) towards the 'infinity' of a singular re- lation between listener and music. For although my concern is certainly the musical act qua act and its nominally future-directed moment of mu- sical engagement, it is also clear that the quest for autonomy, like the quest for certainty, is more of- ten than not interrupted from outside by events, usually surprises, which ask the listener to ques- tion the extent of his or her autonomy as a sub- ject, or, inversely, his or her contingency and de- pendency on the music. Although spontaneity, then, is one of its ele- ments, perhaps even the primary one, given that sensation - hearing - lies at its core, the musical act is not simply a Bergsonian instant without context or continuity, and its spontaneity must THE MUSICAL TIMES / SPRING 2001 11</page><page sequence="2">3.

Nevertheless, although I there- fore agree with Whittall that the spontaneity of the experiential moment of the musical act needs to be tempered by something that can take ac- count of musical knowledge and expectations, I find his suggestion that it should be tempered by 'memory and modelling' (p.14) unsatisfactory, not only for the pragmatic reason that memory and modelling seem to presuppose a high mini- mum level of musical knowledge (does Whittall's well-oiled mechanical construction - his 'inter- pretative engine' (p.14) - work in the same way as the fragile act of listening?), but also because to my mind these are already part of the act as conventionally conceived, one half of its inten- tionality. Rather, in order to account for its tem- poral continuity as an act beyond the apparently instantaneous spontaneity of each 'single' con- scious act or gesture (and this includes music that, qua compositional procedure, emphasises tendencies towards discontinuity), tempering ought to come from outside the act (which is to say, not as a balancing 'tendency'). Going some- what against the notion of a musical act as whol- ly spontaneous, intentional and future-facing ought to be not the activity of memory and mod- elling, but the absolute otherness of temporality (which 'makes' memory what it is - in both sens- es: 'constructs', and 'forces'). This tempering ele- ment may be extrapolated from the thought of Emmanuel Levinas, whose conception of the act (not his term) reorientates its intentionality (not Bakhtin's term) differently - ethically.3 This is why I broached the idea of epiphany, for the apparent reciprocity of, or symmetry be- tween, listener and music is, I believe, no more than apparent. Conventionally, of course, we as- cribe a great deal of intentionality to our relation with music, to the musical act. But although it is hardly worth writing that music is primarily a temporal event, and almost as banal to observe that our ways of thinking about music thus ought to be modelled on the experience not of space but of time, to my mind we are yet to find an ade- quate way of doing this. The Husserlian 'adequa- tion' of thought and object that lies behind much writing is unsatisfactory, not just because it might fail, being an act rather than a state of being; but, more profoundly, because the idea of adequation is itself problematic from a temporal perspective. More specifically, attempts at a phenomenology of music (Thomas Clifton's and David Lewin's be- ing probably two of the greatest4) have failed not because their conception of 'experience' failed to balance, symbiotically or otherwise, complemen- tary tendencies towards understanding and expe- rience, reflection and perception, form and ex- pression, continuity and discontinuity, disso- nance and consonance, and so on ad infinitum, but in fact for the very opposite reason: they did not allow for and retain the absolute surprise of the temporal. Such is their essential modernism. Even when the idea of surprise was brought into the discussion (and, then, not often enough), discussion always turned sooner or later towards modes of understanding predicated upon assimi- lation and reduction, upon the idea that 'intelligi- bility is what can be rendered present'.5 As a way of dealing with surprise, I believe that epiphanies may provide a small element of a phenomenolo- gy of music, for their fundamental role is to ques- tion the cosy symmetry between the listener and the music - from outside. A T this point, it may be worth revisiting Edward Cone briefly. As I chose to read Cone (more about this choice below), epiphanies concern one aspect of the relations between gestures as they are experi- enced by the listener. They ask the listener during performance about his or her relation to the mu- sic. This, not the ostensible topic of 'consequen- tiality', is, I believe, the central issue of 'Twelfth night' - or at any rate, the fundamental lesson which might be extrapolated from a slow reading of that essay and Cone's other essays from the mid- to late-1980s. To recapitulate, epiphanies are surprising, and lie towards the other end of the expressive spec- trum from gestures that are commonly said to be inevitable or predictable. They are events where the gesture confronting the listener is neither a necessary outcome nor a logical consequence of earlier gestures; at any rate, whether it is or is not, they are not experienced as related in this manner, for they are not a matter of structure (though they can be traced - followed - within structure) but of experience, and are thus contingent upon the vicissitudes of performance and - though Cone did not go this far - performers. According to Cone, the surprise embodied in certain ges- tures, or epiphanies, radically undermines the en- tire 'deterministic ideal' behind the conventional analytical trajectory: More than that, our difficulties in dealing ade- quately with such passages [as the major-mode ending of Beethoven's F minor Quartet] should remind us that our modern analytical methods, powerful as they are, have serious limitations. Those methods have taught us many things, es- pecially about musical continuity; but they have never worked so well, nor so generally, as their proponents have sometimes claimed. In particu- lar, they are unable to deal adequately with dis- continuities of every kind, with contrast, with surprise - with just those situations that call into question the concept of inevitability because THE MUSICAL TIMES / SPRING 2001 12</page><page sequence="3">they seem to depend on the exercise of the com- poser's free will, not to say his caprice.6 No doubt there may be an element of exagger- ation here; after all, 'Twelfth night' was a keynote speech. But Cone's point is surely more than just the lipservice of 'any musicologist with a healthy respect for theory', as Whittall's brush stroke paints it (p.12). It is that conventional analytical techniques can handle neither the surprise of epiphanies nor the absolute contrast with what 'goes on to precede them': with their carnivalising tendency away from the word towards the act, from discourse towards the event, they were its heart of darkness. For Cone, musical gestures oc- casionally appear unforeseen and unpredictable in the way that life consists, not just of the fol- lowing through of a plan (however much of a scheme one may have psychologically in mind), but equally of an unpredictable, and thus gen- uinely creative sequence of actions, reactions, and gestures. This is a similar argument to one Cone had put forward in 'Beyond analysis' with regard to the intractability of certain aspects of - more precisely, the motivation behind - musical structure. In 'Twelfth night', though, Cone takes the issue of how knowledge functions during the musical experience in a different direction. Whereas he had in 'Beyond analysis' maintained that the listener cannot know why music is struc- tured as it is, in 'Twelfth night' he argues that, in addition, and even if he or she knows that the work is in, say, sonata form with the divisions falling in such-and-such places, the listener can- not know how music is structured, at least, not in advance - not fully in advance. Experience is its own reward. This, for me, is the significance of epiphanies, for they act as a means by which the listener is asked to confront the surprise - the contingency - of certain gestures, whether the surprise is per- formative, structural, expressive, or a certain type of musical noise,7 or any fragile combination of the four. In fact, surprise is central to epiphany, and to talk about one ought to be - usually - to talk about the other. However, the greater the epiphany/surprise embodied in a gesture, the greater the possibility that the event will ask the listener to question the very relation between what is and what was and reassess his or her under- standing of (read: relation to) the ongoing conti- nuity of the music, especially the apparent de- rivations between gestures (the aesthetic embod- iment of causality). For as Thomas Clifton noted, 'we, as participants, have been abruptly thrown out of the temporal life of the movement and back into ourselves. [...] it is in the nature of sur- prise to suddenly strengthen self-consciousness.'8 Of course, I have read too much into Cone's es- says, as I will be the first to admit - again. I have done so, however, not just because his music crit- icism is exemplary and deserves close attention, 6.

Epiphany arose as part of this project, as part of a meditation upon, amongst oth- er things, a potentially musical interpretation of a remark of Bakhtin's: 'there is no understanding of evaluative non-predetermination, unexpectedness, as it were, "surprisingness", absolute innovation, miracle, and so forth.'9 To be sure, I might simi- larly have described epiphanies in terms of the anagnorisis and peripeteia (recognition and re- versal) that bring memory into the equation (terms which Jonathan Cross has recently used to good effectlo). But my concern so far has been with the 'first half' of the equation: surprise. Hence Whittall's remark that epiphany 'is diffi- cult to detach from the compulsions of retrospec- tive, contemplative thinking (as a way of enhanc- ing musical experience)' (p.12), a remark which constitutes a certain egology of music, unneces- sarily implies that I had assumed that epiphanies are 'detached' from everything that can be tarred with the brush of 'the large-scale' or 'the formal', and that I had neglected the role of thinking about the large-scale formal perspective during the musical experience (by which Whittall also seems to believe that I ignored the possibility that music theory might come in useful, 'form' in both its technical and hermeneutic tendencies being something which Whittall seems to equate with music theory). Not so. During performance, epi- phanies in fact open up the immediate present of this gesture - such as it is, ephemeral, transient, temporary, and so on - to the larger perspective of formal design. They are precisely the form-giv- ing moment of a musical gesture, both a revela- tion about and a revelation of: Whenever we feel our mortal darkness illumi- nated; whenever we feel sudden clarity stabbing into our darkness - as when we are literally en- lightened by poetry, or music, or logic, or prophe- cy, or insight - then Apollo is the name of what happened to us.ll The very fact of the eruption, remembered pres- ence, and aftermath of epiphanies indicates that their temporality is, first and foremost, a human temporality, and a function of the relations be- tween performers and listeners taking part in the event. Like earthquakes, epiphanies occur more frequently than we are led to believe, complacent as we can easily be in our recorded age from 'over- exposure' to music.12 Indeed, it is often broadly epiphanic events that 'prompt' us to use language and talk about music, as with essays as different as Cone's 'Schubert's promissory note: an exercise in musical hermeneutics', Joseph Dubiel's 'Com- poser, theorist, composer/theorist', and Rose Rosen- gard Subotnik's 'How could Chopin's A-major Prelude be deconstructed?'.13 CCEPTING that epiphanies embody an element of absolute surprise ought to have certain consequences for the way we think about the relation between listener and music, for what this journal's last ed- itorial sagely called 'the primary responsibility of the ear' (p.2). Challenging the self-proclaimed necessity of causality within a succession of mu- sical gestures, epiphanies question the very na- ture of the listener's desire to anthropomorphise music and, consequently, the extent of the conti- nuity and motivation of aesthetic subjectivity (thematic progression and derivation, respective- ly). They function like temporal 'vortexes.'l4 The significance of this ought to be clear: In itself the conception of the epiphany makes a large statement about the nature of human life; it suggests that the human fact does not dominate the scene of our existence - for something to 'show forth' it must first be hidden, and the hu- man fact is submerged in and subordinated to a world of circumstance, the world of things; it is known only in glimpses, emerging from the dan- ger or sordidness in which it is implicated.15 This is not to say that my conception of epiphany is, like Trilling's, Freudian (though Whit- tall seems to read me that way), in the sense that reason is fallen and resident within the uncon- scious, and that only some sudden revelation can break the mystical power of irrationality and re- store reason to its prelapsarian power. My point is not that in the beginning there was reason, and therefore an opposition between reason and reve- lation, experience and epiphany. It is simply that there are limits to the mastery of reason (as con- ventionally understood) in the musical act, in large part because aesthetic temporality is not the same as the self-identical time required by cogni- tive reason16, and hence that, in order to be more generous towards the musical experience in our writing, we need a kinder understanding, not of reason or musical knowledge, but of temporality. Indeed, the fact that there is an asymmetry be- tween act and object means that the listener's at- tempt to come to terms with the significance of an epiphany by drawing it into his or her ongoing understanding of the music can be only partial; reflecting on his or her relation to the music, the epiphany remains a surprise. That is, even if we acknowledge the roles of 'memory and modelling' (p.14) in assimilating the surprises of epiphanies into the wider fabric of musical form, such as- similation ought to be acknowledged as being no more than incomplete. To claim otherwise would surely be to objectify music and to override the anthropomorphic quality of musical engagement, THE MUSICAL TIMES / SPRING 2001 14</page><page sequence="5">at the root of which is the very possibility of sur- prise central to live performance. It is in this respect that I think we ought to think of their being a certain 'passivity' within the musical act, and thus a certain reliance - which is not necessarily an exclusive insistence - on the temporal present, however fleeting and unpre- dictable. Indeed, one of my motives is to suggest that precisely what epiphanies do is ask the lis- tener to face up to the absolutely other temporal- ity of music - its 'coming-to-be' for the listener. As I think Whittall and I agree (if not in our in- terpretation of it), 'the heart of the musical act is a human encounter' (p.12), though what I am trying to get at here with passivity is a kind of aesthetic 'silence', a fragile nakedness that em- bodies a conscious withdrawal back from, rather than a violent assertion of, identity and musical subjectivity. I introduced epiphany in order to come to terms with a specific, but I believe im- portant, mode of encounter which music pre- sents as central to its - and therefore our - very nature, which is what we might recognise as 'the face' of music.l7 Hence the 'world of gestures and responses' to which I alluded, and the obligation to keep attending this musical world and keep present to consciousness its face - a requirement that is unending and, because it turns on contin- gency, best undertaken through live performance. Indeed, it may be that epiphanies can't happen when listening to recordings, but they certainly do happen in live performance, which is by na- ture contingent - unpredictable, vulnerable, and risky. Strange, then, that Whittall should comment, for example, that the theories underpinning my remarks are 'impervious to any possibility that the act of listening is inherently vulnerable or un- stable' (p.9). In fact, that is exactly the opposite of what I meant, and I don't see how Whittall ma- noeuvred himself into that corner. It is precisely because the act of listening is 'vulnerable and un- stable' that The rite has, as I said, an 'undoubted (but nevertheless fragile) power to hold one's at- tention [emphasis now added]' - to make the lis- tener responsible for it. Similarly, Whittall's jibe, 'How ethical is that?' (p.10) refers back to his previous misreading, that not only is 'the listening "synthesis" ethically su- perior to the thinking "symbiosis", but also [em- phasis added] that what happens in the "act" of listening can be confidently defined in a singular as well as an ethical manner' (p.9). I said nothing about the idea which follows Whittall's 'also', and the description 'ethically superior' is not mine. In fact, I believe almost the opposite, and that Whit- tall's implicit equation between 'singularity' and 'ethics' is misleading, and his use of the adjective 'singular' quite worrying. Indeed, consider one of Whittall's main worries, namely whether 'the act of listening - that supremely subjective and elu- sive phenomenon, so subject to distorted recol- lection and real-time distraction - can be plausi- bly be accorded a hot line to "an ethical world of gestures and responses" that is closed off from contemplation and reflection' (p.10). This is a worry for him because of his prior equation of an ethical world with nothing less than a situation that is not 'supremely subjective and elusive' and so on. If, however, interactions between listener and music were allowed to be 'supremely subjec- tive, elusive, subject to distorted recollection and real-time distraction', modelled less (which does not mean 'not at all') on the metaphor of legal im- peratives and more (which does not mean 'en- tirely') on the prosaic vulnerabilities of everyday human interaction, this would, I believe, open up the musical act to a whole new dimension of en- gagement (in fact, not 'new' at all, just more kind- ly understood). Hence epiphany, the lesson of which ought to be, if nothing else, humbling. Calling into question the spontaneity of the listener's act, then, the nature of the significance of epiphanies is first and foremost ethical. Epi- phanies reveal what ought to be the natural, liter- ally 'sensation-al', passivity of listening; but this passivity entails a responsibility to the music - it is a vigilant passivity. Hence the relation between listener and music is neither reciprocal nor dia- logic, but asymmetrical and answerable. Para- doxically, in fact, the two never meet: the listener is responsible for each gesture - ought to care for it - even before it becomes present to his or her consciousness. Hence the act of listening, if it is to respond to the subjectivities of music which Whittall describes on his opening page (p.7), requires attention (something to which, for me at any rate, recordings aren't automatically con- ducive) and is vulnerable to all-too-human lapses of concentration. It is difficult. 15.

W HAT HAT about the consequences of all this for musical prac- tices? Let us begin with Whit- tall's suggestion that 'when em- phasis in listening shifts away from the live pub- lic performance to recordings heard under do- mestic conditions, [...] I would question whether real-time acts of engagement are always and au- tomatically more genuinely 'synthetic' than the thinking engagement with the score' (p.11). There are two points to make here. First, I had not suggested that; I merely said that they are two different things, and require different (but, yes, related) kinds of skills. The passage Whittall has misread is this one: Strictly speaking, of course, [recording] has sim- ply replaced one kind of work with another, though the problem is that the nature of the work involved in the private consumption of THE MUSICAL TIMES / SPRING 2001 15</page><page sequence="6">18.

Anthony Gritten is Lecturer in Music at the University of East Anglia, Norwich recording (not to mention the public experience of muzak) has yet to be properly investigated. In particular, it would be interesting to know the extent to which there are continuities with the activity of and participation in live performance, or whether [private consumption of recordings] is an entirely different order of musical experi- ence. Secondly, I am unsatisfied by Whittall's implicit equation between 'recordings heard under do- mestic conditions' and 'thinking engagement with the score', not because these two activities cannot overlap (clearly they do, and much analytical spadework goes on in this manner), but because I don't believe we yet understand the extent to which the act of following the score while listen- ing actually effects, influences, and even changes the musical experience and therefore what we write about it. In live performance, the nature of engagement may well be different to that of pri- vate activity, not only because the listener sees and co-performs, but also partly because record- ings embody a dangerous, if necessary, assump- tion (particularly acute in 'live' recordings) that the act is more permanent than it is, and that we somehow ought to have a choice as to when and where to face up to what we know and can say about it. But it is worth asking, Is not what is not permanent more human than what is? Whittall remarks, for example, that 'It is getting close to an aesthetic which favours warm beer and cycling to the village church on Sunday mornings to argue that the effort of attending such a perfor- mance, and of attending to it, are superior virtues in themselves' (p.11). Although, being a per- former, I certainly do value live performance, I did not mean to imply the Protestant idea that 'at- tending a performance' is itself virtuous. Maybe it is; but my belief is that there are certain over- whelming questions that need answering during performance, which are less pressing, if at all, out- side it, and that as a consequence, 'attending to it' (Whittall's second, inserted clause) is not a trivial matter. Indeed, being an act, there is always a per- formative 'surplus' (Bakhtin's term) to listening that overflows any attempt to write about it, since, in the very act of addressing itself to someone, music breaks open its own totality and prevents its enclosure within its objectivity. As Levinas asks rhetorically about this surplus, 'Does the Saying signify nothing but the Said?'.18 This surplus aris- es from the very temporality of music, and is em- bodied, as I have suggested, in epiphanies. Whit- tall himself actually knows this, and, acknowledg- ing the absolute difference between reading about music and listening to live performances, wearily admits that he writes 'in the hope that at least some of [my readers] will seek out and listen to the music in question - even, if necessary, at a public concert [sic]' (p.11). It seems, then, that Whittall's way harks back to a situation Furtwangler described in 1936: 'A vision of the world that is merely talked about, i.e. one to which lip-service is paid, which is at best known, rather than one which is lived and active, is the signature of our contemporary con- ditions'.19 This is why, of course, from Whittall's perspective I have 'a problem with culture' (p. 11) and a fear of 'Drowning in Noise'20; I may also have a problem with 'an educational system', though I don't know. This does not mean, how- ever, that I also believe that 'that motion [not a word I would choose] from act to object renders the object resistant to all subjective interpretation and response' (p.11). What I wrote was that 'a musical culture sustains the very musical event upon which it preys. This is the essence of the symbiotic life-cycle of a musical culture', and by this I meant that act and object are two sides of the same coin, and a 'subjective interpretation and response' no more or less than part of the life-cycle of a musical culture - and, yes, inher- ently vulnerable. My own current focus is simply on one side of the coin - the act - rather than the other, hence my bias towards epiphany. Whittall asks later, in a similar vein, 'if "all musical events and the acts that create them" are "transformed, sometimes out of all recognition" by the passing of time, how can we be sure what the pure, orig- inal experience truly was?' (p.12). This is true, but, again, it is not what I said. I did not say that a musical practice is or should aim to exist as a process of constant reconstruction; that would indeed be 'utopian' (p.12), as Whittall rightly says. I was trying to point out the on-going, changing, transformative, which is to say fundamentally creative effect of 'subjective interpretation and re- sponse' upon the musical object. Writing chases its tail; or, as it says on the back of Frank Ker- mode's The uses of error,21 more poetically, 'The history of interpretation [...] is to an incalculable extent a history of error'. I hope to have made several points about the nature of the musical act and, therefore, how we talk about it. The central issue was what I believe to be Arnold Whittall's misconception of the rela- tion between listener and music during live mu- sical performance. As to whether my 'rant against recording' (p.10) was justified, I'm afraid that al- though I remain open to correction, I also remain an unreconstructed believer in 'musicking'.22 I should end, nevertheless, by noting that I have learnt several things from Whittall's paper. I am grateful for the lecture, for though I was not born on a Thursday, I have far to go. Neverthe- less, despite its official seriousness, I still believe that writing is an opportunity for preparation and rehearsal - so, yes, I dissent. If you need a con- fession, come and hear me perform. And after- wards we'll go for a warm beer. THE MUSICAL TIMES / SPRING 2001 16</page></plain_text>
