<plain_text><page sequence="1">A FURTHER SURVEY OF FEMALE DELINQUENTS UNDERGOING BORSTAL TRAINING1 By P. EPPS (London) Three hundred girls, sentenced to Borstal training between April 1948 and August 1950, were surveyed in a previous article and various points which emerged from it were discussed (3). It is thought that a review of 100 of this series, comprising 90 who were recalled for further training owing to un satisfactory behaviour, and 10 who served prison sentences for offences committed before the end of their Borstal sentences, may be of interest from the viewpoint of possible factors accounting for their failure to benefit from training so far. This sample represents, in the main, the first 100 to be seen at Holloway prison, either in transit to the recall centre or serving sentences, although it includes a few who passed directly from other prisons to the centre or served sentences elsewhere. A comparison, based on various factors determined in the first survey, is made between the original group of 300 girls (termed Group A) and the present series of 100 (termed Group B). This leads to a discussion of various points, suggested both by these comparative figures and also by clinical assessment of their attitude and behaviour at this later stage of their careers as compared with the original training period. COMPARISON OF THE TWO GROUPS Age and Charge No particular age-group appeared to be prone to failure, the average age on reception, in each group, being 18-8 years. Larceny remains the commonest offence for which they were sentenced to Borstal training, occurring in 44-6 per cent, of Group A and 45 per cent, of Group B girls. The remaining charges are as follows : housebreaking, in Group A 16 per cent, and Group B 18 per cent. ; breach of recognizance, 16-6 per cent, and 18 per cent. ; absconding from an Approved School, 17 per cent, and 14 per cent ; wandering abroad, 1-6 per cent, and 2 per cent ; drunkenness, 1 per cent, and 3 per cent. 1 I am indebted to the Prison Commissioners for permission to publish this article, which does not necessarily represent their views. 265</page><page sequence="2">266 p. EPPS Of the 26 noted in Group A as having had no charge but that of ' care and protection ' or ' beyond control but whose behaviour in Remand Home or Approved School was deemed to warrant a Borstal sentence, 9 reappeared in Group B, two charged now with larceny, one with drunkenness and six still with no charge. Five of the latter were recalled for poor work records and promiscuous sex behaviour ; one absconded from her home shortly after returning to it. Four of the 11 first offenders, who had presumably been sentenced to Borstal training because of the seriousness of the offence, were recalled, the original charges being housebreaking in three cases and larceny in one. Two were recalled for unsatisfactory behaviour, and two had new charges, one for housebreaking again and one for wandering abroad. Home Background An unsatisfactory home background figured prominently in the original survey, as it has done in numerous studies on delinquents, but it has been observed that comparisons are difficult since varying estimates as to what constitutes a deprived home exist. Some authors have included economic and social, as well as emotional factors, but the important result, that of the individual's reaction to such stresses, may be difficult to judge retrospectively. It may be of significance that in two respects the rate in the second series was higher, namely, in those whose parents had been separated or divorced (Group A 25-3 per cent., Group B 35 per cent.) and in those brought up in Institutions (Group A 9 per cent., Group B 13 per cent.). Illegitimacy was the same in each group (10 per cent.). Figures for the incidence of abnor mality in the family history (psychosis, mental deficiency, alcoholism) showed little difference in the two groups. Delinquency in the home remained high (Group A 28 6 per cent., Group B 31 per cent). School Records Comparison of school records shows that the proportion of those who received any form of higher education was only slightly lower among the recalled (Group A 13-3 per cent., Group B 11 per cent.) ; with a correspond ing slight rise among those who had been to elementary schools only (Group A 86-6 per cent., Group B 89 per cent.). Figures for ex-Approved School girls remained high (Group A 49-3 per cent., Group B 48 per cent). Intelligence and Emotional Instability The small number of girls of superior intelligence reappeared in much the same proportion, Group A showing 3-8 per cent, and Group B 3 per cent. The distribution of average and inferior intelligence in Group A was 49-8 per cent and 46 4 per cent., while in Group B it was 46 per cent, and 51 per</page><page sequence="3">FEMALE DELINQUENTS UNDERGOING BORSTAL TRAINING 267 cent., showing some tendency on the part of girls of dull intelligence to re appear in increased numbers. The proportion assessed as emotionally unstable is considerably higher amongst the recalled and reconvicted, being 27-6 per cent, in Group A and 37 per cent, in Group B. Of these 37 unstable girls in Group B, 17 were of average intelligence and 20 were dull, a proportion that corresponded mainly with that originally found in Group A, where 43 of the 83 unstable girls were dull. Neurotic Trends Girls with character disorder and psychopathic traits tended to fall into the group of emotionally unstable already discussed ; in addition we find girls with neurotic conflict. Those presenting neurotic symptoms were 21 per cent, in Group A and 27 per cent, in Group B. Fifteen of these 27 neurotic girls (nine of average and six of inferior intelligence) had also figured in the group of 37 unstable girls, giving a total of 49 unstable and/or neurotic girls, one of whom had superior, 20 average and 28 inferior intelligence. Little difference was found among those who had received out-patient psychiatric treatment (Group A 6-3 per cent., Group B 4 per cent.) or had been certified patients in Mental Hospitals (Group A 1-3 per cent., Group B 1 per cent.). Physical Health Those assessed as having some physical defect were only slightly higher in the second group (Group A 10 per cent., Group B 12 per cent.), while height and weight showed little difference (Group A 62 7 ins, 129 lbs, and Group B 62-7 ins, and 134 2 lbs). Insufficient anthropomorphic work was done on this particular series to justify any conclusions regarding the connec tion between delinquency, personality and physique, although some of these girls were included in another study dealing with this problem. Pregnancy and Venereal Disease Figures for these conditions remained much the same in the two groups. Syphilis occurred in 14-6 per cent, of Group A and 15 per cent, of Group B, and gonorrhoea in 28-6 per cent, of Group A and 29 per cent, of Group B. Pregnancy was present in 19 6 per cent, of Group A and 19 per cent, of Group B, from which it might be concluded that the opinion that pregnancy had a stabilizing effect was wrong, or it might be merely a consequence of the greater difficulties that face the girl, burdened with a baby, on her release. The 15 per cent, found to be virgo intacta among the original trainees</page><page sequence="4">268 p. EPFS dropped to 10 per cent, in those recalled and reconvicted, whilst those judged sufficiently promiscuous to rank as prostitutes rose from 34 per cent, in Group A to 39 per cent, in Group B. Thirty-three (five of whom were married) of the 100 recalled or re sentenced, were found to be pregnant, eleven of them for the second time. The social work entailed in dealing with this number of illegitimate children is therefore a major problem, and it would be interesting to see, by a follow up study of the children, how many of the latter secured a sufficiently stable environment to ensure normal development. DISCUSSION It is thought that certain problems, which merit discussion, emerge from this survey of 100 girls who, of the 300 originally reviewed, represent some of those who have given evidence of continued social maladjustment after undergoing a period of Borstal training, which averaged 21-5 months (6). There is a hard core among trainees, who will later swell the ranks of recidivists, and it would seem suitable to endeavour to pick them out as early as possible in their delinquent careers for more intensive study and treatment, since it it doubtful that the usual Borstal régime of discipline, training in work and educational classes, will prove sufficient for their needs. It is even more urgent to tackle such cases at an earlier stage, in Remand Home or Approved School (and it is to be noted that 48 per cent, of Group B are ex-Approved School girls), and therefore the increased availability of psychiatric investigation and treatment now found in such homes and schools is welcomed. Work on prediction tables, along the lines originated in U.S.A. by the Gluecks, and more recently under investigation in this country, could usefully be validated for the Borstal group, as an objective way of picking out those girls likely to be poor risks and in need of different or additional treatment. The higher rate in Group B of unfavourable home conditions, whether pertaining to those with separated or divorced parents, to those who passed their childhood in Institutions or to those from delinquent homes, shows that the placing of girls on completion of training needs very skilled hand ling. The majority of girls, often by their own wish, return to their homes, only a minority going to hostels or residential posts. Careful investigation of the home and of the attitudes likely to be encountered by the girl, together with preparation of the parents for her reception, calls for the expenditure of much time by skilled social workers. The advisability, particularly for those being discharged from a ' closed ' Borstal institution, of short periods</page><page sequence="5">FEMALE DELINQUENTS UNDERGOING BORSTAL TRAINING 269 on parole at home before final release on licence, might be considered in these cases. Passing to those whose personality problems are more prominent than their environmental difficulties, we come to the emotionally unstable and neurotic groups, both of whom reappear in Group B in increased propor tions. It is doubtful whether the dispatch of a few of the more outstandingly maladjusted to another establishment, for psychiatric observation and pos sibly psycho-therapy, is the answer to the problem. The effect of the emotionally unstable girls on a group, and the resulting epidemics of aggres sive behaviour, were pointed out in the original survey of trainees. The connection between these outbreaks, whether the aggression was directed outwards as ' smashing ' or inwards as self-mutilation, and its relation to unhealthy erotic behaviour were discussed. Their needs would probably be better met if placed in a smaller community, where they could be handled more individually, in a therapeutic atmosphere by a specially skilled staff. Here group-therapy, allied with individual treatment, could be practised, combined with the usual occupational and educational programme followed in a Borstal Institution. It is by no means only the girls of dull intelligence who contribute to the unstable and neurotic groups, so that lack of intelli gence would be no bar to therapy and, even amongst the dull, there are some with sufficient insight to profit by therapy. There are, of course, those of dull intelligence but of relative stability, for whom a prolongation of the usual training régime would provide the answer. Others, who would profit by a more individual handling possible in a smaller group, are to be found amongst those institutionalized in childhood, and whom we have already noted as reappearing in Group B in increased pro portion. Although immaturity is commonly found in delinquents, it seems to be particularly striking in this class, as is their difficulty in forming any but superficial emotional attachments. It is possible that administrative elasticity would allow of temporary transfer of the less unstable to this small centre for treatment, while those more seriously disturbed might need to spend all or most of their training period there. The chronic absconders from Approved Schools form an interesting sub group of the unstable, many of them being more disturbed than is apparent on the surface. Of the 14 who reappeared in Group B, 10 were labelled unstable and two neurotic. It is probable that a compulsive element is often present, which tends to be overlooked, since they may conform for the time being to ' closed ' conditions, in which owing to their history they are usually confined, and they may even, in some cases, welcome the discipline which relieves them of all decisions. Once released, their problems return, with the probability that, without deeper investigation and treatment, the previous</page><page sequence="6">270 p. EPPS reaction pattern reasserts itself. The figures for those charged with abscond ing from Approved Schools (17 per cent, and 14 per cent.) do not by any means include all the ' runners ' since many of those charged with breach of recognizance (16 6 per cent, and 18 per cent.) have broken probation by absconding from hostels and others from their homes, so that this group presents a problem of some size. The sexually promiscuous form another group which raises various problems. That a smaller proportion of those originally thought to be virgo intacta reappears in the second group might be taken to show that con tamination is a minor matter, but clinical impressions suggest that it is, never theless, an important one. The majority of Borstal girls have been amateur prostitutes before being sentenced and, while care can be taken to remove the professional prostitute from the Borstal institution, there is undoubtedly the risk of adversely influencing those less experienced, with the graduation of the amateur to the professional class after release. As with the criminally experienced, careful classification is important in dealing with this problem. It is probably a more urgent problem with the girls than the boys, and it is unfortunate that the necessarily small number of establishments for girls, who number only approximately 200 to 3,000 boys (7), renders classification more difficult. The Prison Commissioners' proposal to divide the ' closed ' Borstal for girls into two may foreshadow even smaller establishments and better classification (5). CONCLUSIONS 1. Reference to the somewhat scanty literature on the subject of adoles cent female delinquents suggests that they constitute a very difficult problem, e.g., Aichhorn (1) is far from optimistic in his suggestions for dealing with sexually promiscuous girls. It would seem advisable if those likely to prove recalcitrant to the usual Borstal régime could be picked out at the onset of their training for more intensive investigation and treatment. 2. Emotionally unstable girls and those showing neurotic symptoms, or evidence of neurotic conflict, return in increased proportion. It is suggested that they need a greater degree of individual handling, such as could be applied in a small group, where the usual régime can be augmented by group and individual psychotherapy. Girls with a history of having passed much time in Institutions or of having repeatedly run from their homes or from Institutions also need the benefit of this mode of rehabilitation. 3. Careful classification is needed to prevent the sexually promiscuous unduly influencing the sexually inexperienced. Those among the latter whose behaviour rests on a neurotic basis, or who are judged to belong to</page><page sequence="7">FEMALE DELINQUENTS UNDERGOING BORSTAL TRAINING 271 the ' larval ' group of prostitutes described by Glover (4), may be suitably referred to the smaller group previously described. 4. Those potential failures recalled for further training need careful scrutiny to see if any treatable factors in their delinquency have been missed. The report (8) that recalled girls are conscious of failure, yet apathetic about the future, would seem to make a vigorous rehabilitation programme, in cluding all means of approach, desirable. 5. External and internal factors in social maladjustment are much inter linked, but those girls who have to return to unsatisfactory homes need con siderable help from a social worker, whose efforts need to be directed both towards the girl and the parents, or parent substitutes. Much work is also demanded from the social workers concerned with the care of girls released with their babies. A follow-up study to show the number of girls who eventually separate from their children might suggest that, in the light of work done by Bowlby (2) and others on the effects of separation on per sonality development in the child, more attention could be directed to the least unfavourable time of separation.
