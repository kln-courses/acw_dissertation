<plain_text><page sequence="1">SUMMARIES LURIANIC KABBALAH: BETWEEN MYTH AND SCIENCE Joseph Dan Fifty years have passed since Gershom Scholem and Isaiah Tishby published their presentation of the Lurianic myth of the divine con traction before the creation, the catastrophe which occured when creation was attempted, and the saga of the tikkun, the mending of this catastrophe, as characterizing all history, directing human ac tions in the present, and indicating messianic redemption. This was undoubtedly one of the greatest achievements of Scholem and Tishby, which was dominant in kabbalistic scholarship for such a long time; only in the last few years do we see the beginnings of new approaches to this vast subject. This papaer is intended to limit the mythical character of Lurianic Kabbalah by pointing out another aspect, which can be described as scientific, prevailing in the Lurianic concept of the structure of all existence. Medieval Kabbalah, with few and unsystematic exceptions, saw the ten sephirot as intensely personalized divine manifestations. The anthropomorphic character of the divine realm as a whole was dom inant also in the descriptions of the particular sephirot, and this was extended to the inter relationships between them, often designated in intense erotic metaphors. A few examples are scattered between the 13th and 15th centuries, in which the number of the sephirot was extended by seeing a sephirotic structure within each sephirah, and by finding a sephirotic structure in realms outside of the purely divine. Lurianic Kabbalah, however, formulated an intricate concept of the existence of everything - from the supreme Godhead to the lowliest of material beings, in which each being, and each part of each being, is constructed from elements which correspond to the structure of the ten sephirot (of five countenances, according to Lurianic termino logy). The personal, mythical nature of the Zoharic divine hypostases has been transformed into a purely structural concept. The nature of malkhut is that of being last in every portion to which any being is [VII]</page><page sequence="2">SUMMARIES divided, as that oiketer is to be first and highest. It seems appropriate to designate such an attitude, which seeks to define all existence by one, basic and all dominant structural principle, as reflecting a scientific attitude. This aspect does not deny the mythical character of the funda mental Lurianic message. It only demonstrates the arbitrariness of external scholarly terminology when applied to traditional texts. The term 'myth' is used today in the most vague and diffuse manner, losing all specific meaning. Meaning can be found only in limiting myth to a specific textual context, like 'Greek myths' or 'Zoharic myth'. Even then, the external term has to yield to the intrinsic demands of the religious concepts which were developed without awareness of the existence of this terminology. In Lurianism, what modern scholars call 'scientific attitudes' and 'mythical attitudes' could develop side by side without being in conflict, as they are in modern usage. PRINCIPLES AND AIMS IN LURIANIC COSMOLOGY Karl E. Grözinger Are there discernible principles and aims in Lurianic cosmology which are the basis for the development of its quite sophisticated cosmological hierarchy? Are there 'logical' guidelines informing the development of this complicated emanatistic system? The school of Isaac Luria combines two contradictory principles in its cosmological descriptions, which relate to the two rival schools of medieval philo sophy, the 'Nominalist' and the 'Realist'. By means of this combina tion Luria attempts to answer a basic question of medieval philo sophy, namely: How could the infinite Oneness bring forth a plurality of limited beings? The two principles working in Lurianic cosmology may therefore be defined in philosophical terms as: (1) the positivistic principle of physics and mechanics, and (2) the nominalistic principle of aspects (1behinot). Luria applies the first principle in describing the emana tion of the light of En Sof using terms taken from natural science or [VIII]</page><page sequence="3">SUMMARIES evidence of the senses: the infinite light of En Sof, which could not be directly received by a world of limited beings, had therefore to be reduced and weakened by methods found in the physics and mechan ics of liquids and light, by utilization of narrow channels, windows, filters and spatial remoteness. Thus Luria applies his knowledge of natural science in describing the creation of the sensible and intelligi ble world, basing his cosmological doctrine on the assumption that it too was subject to the 'natural law' discernible in this world. Luria utilizes anthropological, psychological and linguistic data and contemporary theories in the same 'scientific' manner in order to describe the creation of a plurality of limited beings out of the infinite Oneness. In contrast to this 'realistic' view however, Luria maintains that all these individual beings are no more than aspects, behinot of one and the same divine light. The term 'aspect', behinah, can be compared to the concept of 'attributes of relation' espoused by me dieval philosophy, in which a plurality of attributes of relation do not affect the essential unity of an individual. By applying this principle, Luria is able to describe reality in its entirety as being a plurality of aspects, without affecting the axiom of one single being, namely the light of En Sof. Plurality exists in the nominalistic sense alone, a plurality only of logical relationship. Luria apparently viewed the combination of the nominalist and realist positions as an adequate depiction of the divine unity as a plurality, or cosmic plurality as aspects of one divine unity. THE METAPHORICAL RELATION BETWEEN GOD AND MAN AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE VISIONARY REALITY IN LURIANIC KABBALAH Rachel Elior The Lurianic discourse reflects an intense and essential human experience which has not been adequately evaluated in the academic inquiry into Lurianic Kabbalah. The theogonic process is expressed in the context of the stages of human procreation, the Divinity and the divine realm are often addressed as 'Mother' and 'Father', who [IX]</page><page sequence="4">SUMMARIES are depicted as engaging in sexual union, as experiencing pregnancy, enduring the pangs of childbirth, as well as nursing and nurturing children. Lurianic Kabbalah thus overturns the common perception of a dichotomy between existence and eternity by depicting the divinity via basic human attributes, to the extent of even granting God the title of Adam Kadmon and by endowing the individual with a divine soul which sustains endless existences by means of meta morphosis. Further, the experiences of crisis, catastrophe and death are no longer solely a part of human destiny but are applied to the heavenly worlds as well (shevirat ha-kelim, mitat ha-melakhim). All concepts relating to life and death lose their finality, since they are now seen as part of the endless process of progression through meta morphic stages. The transition from the infinite to the finite is pre sented in anthropomorphic metaphors which rely upon visual images of the human body and the act of procreation, which becomes the paradigm for divine autogenesis. The male and the female aspects of the Divine are represented in Lurianic imagery in the line and the circle respectively, as a limitless abundance vis-ä-vis the containment of a vessel; as expansion versus limitation; or as the union of oppo sites which together define the divine wholeness. Luria's vision was of the universe as one immense Anthropos forming the archetype for both man and the Divinity. This reality shatters all conventional dichotomies and creates the parallel visions of the Deity in the image of man, and man as a reflection of the Divinity, both unbounded by time and place. ON THE CONCEPT OF ZIMZUM IN KABBALAH AND ITS RESEARCH Moshe Idel The term zimzum recurs several times in the literature of early Kabbalah. Nahmanides' Commentary on Sefer Yezirah contains a significant passage, analysis of which demonstrates its close concep tual similarity to the view found in the Lurianic texts, namely that the first act of creation was the withdrawal of the divine light and glory [X]</page><page sequence="5">SUMMARIES from the space in which the world would be created. Similar views can be detected in other 13th-century texts of the Sefer ha-'Iyyun litera ture. Of great importance for 16th-century Kabbalah are some later developments, where the process of withdrawal is related to the emefgence of evil out of the highest level of the divine world. This view recurs in the writings of Shem Tov ben Shem Tov, a 15th century Castilian kabbalist. The assumption by scholars that the doctrine of the divine with drawal was Isaac Luria's innovation, and that it was developed as a reaction to the expulsion from Spain is examined in the second part of the study. The appendices deal with the epistemological understand ing of zimzum and an early kabbalistic text, probably by Azriel of Gerona. 'TWO YOUNG ROES OF A DOE':THE SECRET SERMON OF ISAAC LURIA BEFORE HIS DEATH Yehuda Liebes In the biographical literature concerning Isaac Luria we are told that the cause of his death was a sermon which he delivered to his disciples centering on a certain passage in the Zohar which opens with the words 'two young roes of a doe'. Since the content of this sermon proved so dangerous, it has not been preserved. The task of the present article is to put forth a conjecture about the possible content of this sermon. Three methods are used in this formidable task: (1) a study of the circumstances in which this sermon was delivered, and of some Lurianic passages that may have some connection to those circum stances; (2) a study of another sermon, which has been preserved, and which had similar consequences, causing the death of Luria's son. This sermon,s theme centered on a doe giving birth with the aid of a serpent's bite. Drawing a parallel between these sermons may aid us in understanding the nature of Lurianic esotericism, as well as other issues; (3) a study of the Zoharic passage on which the sermon was [XI]</page><page sequence="6">SUMMARIES purportedly based, of Zoharic parallels to this passage, and of their Lurianic commentaries. Our conclusions are: firstly, the sermon dealt with the theme of redemption, and furthermore, that its very delivery was meant to hasten the coming of the Messiah; secondly, redemption in this context meant first and foremost the perfection and completion of the soul of Isaac Luria himself and the souls of his closest disciples (especially Haim Vital), these being necessary preliminaries to a redemption which would include the realm of the divine kabbalistic entities (sephirot). This sermon, which can be viewed as the consum mation of Lurianic Kabbalah (regarded, in turn, as the summit of all Kabbalah), may shed new light on the nature of this Kabbalah; perhaps the major concern of Lurianic Kabbalah was not ontological myth surrounding the divine kabbalistic entities, as has previously been thought, but rather the human soul, and especially the souls of Isaac Luria and his inner circle. Thus Isaac Luria is not only the author of Lurianic Kabbalah, but its main subject as well. KATNUT ('SMALLNESS&gt;) AND GADLUT GREATNESS') IN LURIANIC KABBALAH Mordechai Pachter The description of the process of tikkun (restoration) of Ze'ir Anpin (the short-faced one) and Nukbei (his female) after the catastrophic shevirat ha-kelim (the breaking of the vessels) in the divine worlds is one of the most powerful mythical descriptions in Lurianic Kabbalah. This, because it is entirely based on a detailed comparison to the growth of the human being, from his conception in his mother's womb to his old age, with extended use of the pair of concepts katnut and gadlut, which is transferred with mythical daring from the human experience, with all its implications in that context, to the divine experience. However, already in Lurianic theosophy a change occurs in the understanding of katnut and gadlut, which obscures, or even denies, its mythic character. The beginning of this change occurs when these [XII]</page><page sequence="7">SUMMARIES terms cease to depict specific periods in the growth of Ze'irAnpin and Nukbei and begin to mark changing qualitative states in the divine life. In this way, they are removed from the human-biological model, in whose image their meaning is formed in the theosophic context, and become basic principles of a dialectic law, according to which the dynamic of the divine life operates. These principles become trans formed into general cosmic principles, which encompass all being. The result of this is that the rhythm of the changing states of katnut and gadlut encompass all being, although it is clear that it is most significantly expressed in human experience. In the anthropological context, Lurianic writings use the terms katnut and gadlut to refer to basic situations in human history, prima rily Jewish history, in addition to their use to describe basic states in the rhythm of individual life. They also refer to the two extremes in the life rhythm of the exceptional man, the Zaddik, determined primarily by his own initiative, and expressed in his mystical activity. On the other hand, these terms also describe the context of his life, which is interdependent with the society in which he lives. He may therefore descend at times to the level of katnut, not as a result of his own actions, but due to the sins of his generation. And lastly: in several Lurianic writings the possibility is raised of distinguishing between the Zaddik and his generation by use of this contrasting pair of terms, in which the Zaddik is represented by gadlut and the generation in which he lives, by katnut. These meanings for the terms katnut and gadlut became central concepts in Hassidic thought, where they describe and explain phe nomena in human experience, and have been viewed as the innova tion of Hassidism. Our study, however, shows that these concepts were actually borrowed from Lurianic Kabbalah. [XIII]</page><page sequence="8">SUMMARIES SELECTIONS FROM EPHRAIM PENZIERI: LURIA'S SERMON IN JERUSALEM AND THE KAWANAH IN TAKING FOOD Ronit Meroz This article contains selections from the writings of Ephraim Penzieri, Vital's Damascene disciple; a short sermon delivered by Luria in Jerusalem, and Joseph Don Don's report of what Luria had said concerning the kavvanah while taking food. Regarding Luria's sermon, we may never arrive at a firm date for it; but from the point of view of Luria's spiritual development, we may conclude that it was either delivered before his departure for Egypt (which cannot, therefore, have taken place at the age of eight, as legend has it) - or else during a later visit there. At any rate we can conclude (a) that Luria was in Jerusalem as an adult; (b) that the contents of the sermon attest to its belonging to a very early stage, certainly earlier than his permanent settlement in Safed, when his ideas had progressed much further. The second part allows us to identify Don Don as a hitherto unknown disciple of Luria. He is probably also the author of other teachings previously attributed to Vital. There is evidence as well for yet another kabbalist who contributed to the formation of Luria's thought: Simeon Turno. The importance of these writings is not only in the additional light they shed on the Lurianic circle, but also on the development of Lurianic thought between his settlement in Safed and its clearer formulation in Kanfei Yonah. In this period, Luria held some quasi-pantheistic beliefs. We can discern a revival of the 14th-century kabbalistic idea of reincarnation in Lurianic and other 16th-century kabbalistic writ ings, including animal, plant or inanimate reincarnation. Joseph Ashkenazi's strong influence upon Luria, in particular, should be recognized. Reincarnation was viewed as the explanation for a num ber of commandments concerning ritual slaughter, sacrifices, and abstention from certain foods, both in Don Don's writings and in later Lurianic texts. This is linked with the kavvanah in taking food, a [XIV]</page><page sequence="9">SUMMARIES linking of concepts which other 16th-century kabbalists seem to have been anxious to avoid, because of the strkingly mythical implications. LURIA'S STATUS AS AN HALAKHIC AUTHORITY Moshe Halamish Despite his stature, Isaac Luria did not see himself as an halakhic authority (posek). Nonetheless, because of the traditions concerning his erudition and his charismatic personality, his customs and teach ings were accepted as binding in wide circles. This article deals with the question: Did halakhic authorities view Luria as an halakhic authority? This question is primarily relevant when there is a contra diction between his view and that of the halakhic authorities. The halakhic sources provide no definitive answer - there are differences of opinion. Of interest is the use of the term 'king' to describe Isaac Luria's position, apparently an attempt to endow him with a status equivalent to that of a halakhic authority. Analysis of the documents which have come to light reveals that while the devotees of Kabbalah relied on Luria's direct source of heavenly inspiration as the authority for his directives, halakhic authorities on the whole evaluated his pro nouncements according to accepted halakhic norms. HALAKHAH AND COMMERCE IN THE BIOGRAPHY OF ISAAC LURIA Abraham David Isaac Luria's reputation as a distinguished kabbalist was established as early as the end of the 16th century, but his biography is almost unknown, aside from legendary reports in the writings of his pupils. Several sources, including Genizah fragments, provide some in formation about his life in Egypt, prior to his arrival in Safed in the [XV]</page><page sequence="10">SUMMARIES year 1569. Certain details about his image as a Talmudic commenta tor as well as legal authority in Cairo have come to light, as well as his extensive involvement in domestic and international trade in various goods, such as spices, wheat, vegetables, silk and leather garments. One source provides laconic information concerning his philanthro pic activities on behalf of the Safed community. DREAM, VISION AND REALITY IN HAIM VITAL'S SEFER HA-HEZYONOT Michal Own This article analyzes the Book of Visions (Sefer ha-Hezyonot) by Haim Vital as an autobiography. Two main genres׳of the autobio graphy have been classified: (1) the public autobiography; (2) the personal autobiography. We demonstrate that both genres are pres ent in Vital's work, the public and the personal. MOSHE CORDOVERO AND ISAAC LURIA Bracha Sack The similarity between Moshe Cordovero and Isaac Luria is greater than scholars have thought. They both studied the Zohar literature in depth and interpreted it. Both of them attempted to follow the way of life prescribed in the Zohar by R. Simeon bar Yohai and his circle, in the belief that thus they would hasten the redemption. Scholars have shown that Luria was influenced by the idra section of the Zohar; Cordovero was no less influenced by it. One aspect of the veneration of the idra concerns death: the death of R. Simeon bar Yohai as a tikkun. Luria's own death is associated with this concept of death as tikkun. In his discusssion of the various notions of the concept of kiddush ha-Shem (sanctification of the name of God), Cordovero analyzed in depth the concept of death as tikkun. Both Cordovero and Luria established a series of kavvanot for nefilat [XVI]</page><page sequence="11">SUMMARIES apaim in the Shemoneh 'Esreh which is a symbolic act of sanctification of the name of God. Cordovero and Luria alike discussed the death of R. Akivah. Both, following the Zohar, dealt with his origins: on the one hand he was the descendant of converts, and on the other, the paradigm of those who sanctify God's name. This apparent contra diction was explained by the doctrine of metempsychosis; the process by which R. Akiva's soul had returned to the nation of Israel. Thus, kiddush ha-Shem was explained as a human sacrifice whose purpose was to perform an act of tikkun and sustain the Shekhinah. Strengthening the Shekhinah was the goal of Cordovero's circle, which shared the same mystical atmosphere in which Luria lived upon his arrival in Safed. Both Cordovero and Luria habitually studied Kabbalah and delved into its mysteries in the same places which had been frequented by R. Simeon bar Yohai and his circle. They both felt that in this way they would merit the mystical inspiration to which they aspired. GEN1ZATHA-OR IN SIMEON LAVI'S KETEM PAZ AND THE LURIANIC DOCTRINE OF ZIMZUM Boaz Huss In 1571, the year in which Isaac Luria taught his esoteric doctrine in Safed, Simeon Lavi (RaShal) wrote his commentary on the Zohar, Sefer Ketem Paz, in Tripoli, North Africa. A central topic of this work is a description of the process of emanation as a process of sequestra tion of the divine light (genizat ha-or). This concept bears a certain similarity to the kabbalistic doctrines describing zimzum within the Divine which appear in kabbalistic writings prior to the 16th century as well as in the works of Moshe Cordovero, and, as is well known, play a central role in Lurianic Kabbalah. This article discusses the points of similarity between the concept of genizat ha-or as it appears in Sefer Ketem Paz, and the kabbalistic doctrine of zimzum, in particular as it appears in the writings of Luria's disciples. The major similarities are: the view that emanation [XVII]</page><page sequence="12">SUMMARIES involves God's voluntary self-limitation; the principle that the ema nator defines a place for the emanated beings, and the view that the emanated beings cannot bear the strength of the unbounded flow of divine light. Another point of contact is the view that the source of evil is related to the divine self-limitation. However, many differ ences between RaShal's doctrine and that of zimzum are evident as well. A major dissimilarity is that RaShal's system does not depict a crisis in the divine world. Another difference is the absence of the term zimzum in RaShal's thought. The Safedian concepts of zimzum and RaShal's view of the withdrawal of the divine light were developed in approximately the same period. Both RaShal's concept of genizat ha-or and the descrip tions of zimzum in the writings of Cordovero and Luria's disciples are based upon interpretations of Zoharic passages. The points of similarity between Lurianic zimzum and RaShal's genizat ha-or, which developed independently, demonstrate that at least some of the central ideas of the doctrine of zimzum existed in kabbalistic thought without reference to the term zimzum. The contemporaneous emergence of these views illustrates two major characteristics of Kabbalah in this period: the attempt to create systematic, encompassing systems of thought which unite different and often contradictory views in a new and innovative structure, and the use of Zoharic exegesis in building these systems. THE ZOHARIC COMMENTARIES OF JOSEPH IBN TABUL Zvia Rubin Joseph Ibn Tabul, one of the closest disciples of Isaac Luria, wrote many commentaries on the Zohar. This article analyses his herme neutical techniques and his literary methods as reflected in these works, based on a comparison of Tabul's Zoharic commentaries and those of Luria. One of our conclusions is: Tabul commented on sections of the Zohar which his master did not deal with, and more surprisingly, Tabul interpreted sections of the Zohar which did have [XVIII]</page><page sequence="13">SUMMARIES commentaries by Luria in a new and different way, although he was aware of Luria's commentaries, even quoting them in his own. THE LURIANIC CONCEPT OF PROPHECY IN THE WRITINGS OF ABRAHAM COHEN HERRERA Nissim Yosha Abraham Cohen Herrera, the disciple of the kabbalist Israel Sarug, wrote two kabbalistic treatises in Spanish in Amsterdam between 1620 and 1630, entitled Casa dela divinidad and Puerta del cielo. These are essentially attempts to give a philosophical and rational interpretation of Lurianic Kabbalah in the concordant spirit of Re naissance scholars, in particular that of Pico della Mirandola and Marsilio Ficino. Herrera dealt with the ontological and epistemologi cal aspects of Lurianic thought, and thereby made a significant con tribution to the development of rationalistic schools within Kabbalah and Hassidism, which emphasized the theosophical and metaphysi cal meaning of Lurianic myth. This article deals with one topic, prophecy, which is central to Herrera's epistemology, articulated primarily in his Casa dela divinidad. Herrera's citations of teachings from his master Israel Sarug in the name of Luria are of great bibliographic significance: Sarug showed him Lurianic sermons on the topic of prophecy, not all of which have parallels in the Lurianic works in print. Herrera's attempt to create a consistent doctrine of prophecy by merging the Neoplatonic school of Marsilio Ficino, the scholasticism of Thomas Aquinas, Jewish philo sophy following Joseph Albo, the Talmud and the Kabbalah, and, finally, Lurianic thought, which he viewed as the apex of truth in general and the culmination of kabbalistic thought in particular, is interesting; Herrera viewed prophecy as the climax of intellectual endeavor, which cannot be achieved without divine grace. It is clear, therefore, why Herrera preferred Albo's views on prophecy to Mai monides', and why he so highly esteemed Aquinas' thought, with its emphasis on divine grace. Despite Herrera's harmonization of Kab balah and Neoplatonism, he rejected several of Ficino's ontological [XIX]</page><page sequence="14">SUMMARIES views, adopted from Pseudo-Dionysius, concerning the origin of the angels between the First Cause and human intellect, for, according to kabbalistic thought, they originate in the World of Yezirah, which is hypostatically a very distant emanation of the First Cause. Herrera,s important contribution is demonstrated in the Lurianic interpretation he gives to Exodus 24:10-11, according to which Moses and Aaron's prophetic achievement was a product of hesed (grace), while that of Nadab and Abihu and the elders of Israel was the product of din (judgement). Herrera adds to this interpretation his own eight kab balistic interpretations in the Lurianic spirit, and four philosophical interpretations in the spirit of scholasticism and the Renaissance. Herrera's concordant attitude is a cultural phenomenon which could occur only in a kabbalist of Converso origin, who was brought up in the scholastic and Renaissance culture, and was intellectually active in the Jewish world. THE INFLUENCE OF LURIA ON THE SHELAH Elliot R. Wolfson The purpose of this article is to examine in detail the influence of the teachings of Isaac Luria on the writings of Isaiah Horowitz, known as the Shelah. I argue that the Shelah should not be considered either as a main conduit for Lurianic Kabbalah or a post-Lurianic kabbalist uninfluenced by Lurianic ideas in any essential way. On the contrary, the evidence shows that the Shelah treated the teachings of Luria as Kabbalah in its most proper sense and therefore restricted transmis sion of them to oral channels, within the geographical boundaries of the land of Israel. While the Shelah did not expound Lurianic Kabba lah at any length in writing, his own works are filled with references to Lurianic motifs and texts. The Shelah distinguished between theo retical and practical issues, allowing himself to elaborate in detail with respect to the latter. [XX]</page><page sequence="15">SUMMARIES LURIANIC KABBALAH AND RABBI ISAAC HA-COHEN KOOK'S PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEM Joseph Ben-Shlomo Rabbi Kook often uses Lurianic terminology and kabbalistic symbols, but entirely transforms their original theosophical and mystical meaning. The fundamental concepts in Lurianic Kabbalah, zimzum, shevirat ha-kelim and tikkun, take on a new meaning within the context of his thought. While zimzum is the barrier to pantheism in his system, as in Luria's, it here expresses the dialectic duality between the transcendental God and His will to create the world, rather than representing a theosophic process within the Divine. Shevirat ha-kelim also does not signify a catastrophic event in the divine world, but rather the differentiation of reality into multi plicity in order that it reunite on a more perfect plane. Tikkun is therefore the actual process by which the world achieves its absolute perfection. This aspiration is embedded within each creature, driving him towards self-perfection. It is found in all beings, from the inani mate to man, and is manifest in physical, and especially biological, processes (such as evolution), an expression of the freedom of each being (whose source is in the divine will) functioning on various levels of consciousness. The goal of perfection is never fully realized, for that is God himself; in this way Rabbi Kook maintains the ontological distinction between God and the world. Of particular significance for his system is the working out of this process in history, and the historiosophical conclusions drawn from the metaphysical realm. This is the basis for his views concerning Israel's redemption in the modern period, which demand a return to nature and the repair of the damage caused by the galut in the physical as much as in the spiritual realm, the goal being the restoration of unity to all manifestations of life.
