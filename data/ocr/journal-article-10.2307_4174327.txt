<plain_text><page sequence="1">Josephus, Mosollamus, and the Ancient Mariner by Dorothy Bilik JOHN Livingston Lowes unearthed the sources that fed Cole- ridge's imagination and thus illuminated Coleridge's poetry. Lowes' method, in part, is to raise rhetorical questions concerning the cruces in the poem and to answer the questions qualifiedly in a fluid, wide-ranging, associative style like Coleridge's own. In dis- cussing the gloss to The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Lowes asks, "But what is the learned Jew, Josephus, doing in that galley?" Josephus (c. C.E. 37-1oo), unlike the Neoplatonist Michael Psellus with whom he is coupled, is not an authority on demonology.' However, Lowes points out that Josephus and others wrote about Cain; and Cain, together with the Wandering Jew, combined with Wordsworth's sug- gestions and other influences, culminated, because of Coleridgean magic, in the haunting figure of the ancient Mariner.2 Coleridge's notebook entries for 1796 include excerpts, in Greek, from Josephus' Antiquities; in an 1802 entry Coleridge refers to Josephus' The Jewish Wars.3 It would be reasonable to assume that Coleridge was reading ' The Road to Xanadu: A Study in the Ways of the Imagination (1927; rpt. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1955), 216-17. However, a few scholars interpret some comments made by Josephus in Antiquities i8:1, 3 and Jewish Wars 2:8 as referring to gilgul- transmigration of souls and not resurrection. Given Coleridge's "cormorant's reading and tenacious and systematizing memory" (Lowes, 39) the possibility exists that Cole- ridge may have known of this. The phrase "tenacious and systematizing memory" is Coleridge's own and Lowes quotes it often. ' Lowes, Ch. xiv, "How an Old Navigator Met Strange Company in Limbo," 220- 338. According to his note on "We Are Seven," Wordsworth made a number of sug- gestions about The Ancient Mariner, among them that the mariner kill the bird. 3 The Notebooks of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, ed., Kathleen Coburn, Bollingen Series L., Vol. 1, 1794-1804 (New York: Pantheon Books, 1957), entries 277; 279; 280; 851. 87 ? 1989 The University of North Carolina Press</page><page sequence="2">88 Josephus and the Ancient Mariner Against Apion along with Josephus' other works. There is a direct mention of Against Apion in an 1815 letter to William Lisle Bowles which suggests Coleridge's familiarity with the work: Besides it is supposed that before his controversy with Apion Josephus had forsaken the Pharisaic, and passed over to the Patrician, Party. Yet in this work are the strongest evidences to be found of the whole Canon of the O.T. as we now have it: as all alike inspired by God himself.4 Whether Coleridge read all Josephus' works in Greek or used Wil- liam Whiston's English translation which first appeared in 1737, he appears to have regarded Josephus with respect. But respect for Jo- sephus as historian or even as occasional demonologist does not fully account for the presence of "the learned Jew" in The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. Indeed, Josephus' importance to the Rime may be in his relation to a question raised by the poem itself and asked by many of its critics: Why did the Mariner shoot the Albatross?5 Given Coleridge's poetic world, perhaps the question should re- main unanswerable, at least in terms of ascribing a motive to the Mariner. Nevertheless, a clear analogue for the slaying of the Alba- tross is found in Against Apion. Josephus cites a Greek historian, Hecataeus of Abdera (4th century B.C.E.), who allegedly witnessed the following incident while on the march with Alexander the Great. During a march to the Red Sea there was, among an escort of Jewish cavalry, a robust, intelligent man, one Mosollamus, who was consid- ered by all the best bowman. Mosollamus noted that the force was halted and discovered that a seer was watching a bird in order to determine what the army should do next. The seer told Mosollamus that if the bird stood still, they ought all to stand still; that if the bird flew onward, they ought all to move forward; that if the bird flew backward, they ought all to retreat. The Jew, without saying a word, drew this bow, shot and struck the bird and killed it. The seer and some others were indignant, and heaped curses upon 4 Collected Letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, ed.

'Why so mad, you poor wretches' he retorted; and then, taking the bird in his hands, continued, 'Pray, how could any sound information about our march be given by this creature, which could not provide for its own safety? Had it been gifted with divination, it would not have come to this spot, for fear of being killed by an arrow of Mosollamus the Jew.'6 Despite obvious differences in tone and form, there are striking parallels between Hecataeus' anecdote and the rime. For, while the Greek tale may be characterized as a comic and didactic analogue of the Mariner's rime, the issues confronting both protagonists are strangely similar. What primarily differentiates Mosollamus from Coleridge's Mari- ner is the former's complete control of events and awareness of his actions. What overwhelmingly characterizes the Mariner is his un- awareness. He appears to be unaware when he shoots the Albatross. He is unaware (as he says twice) when he performs the blessing that is to free him (IV. 285-7).7 Mosollamus is ever aware and alert and secure in his faith. His tale is no paradigm for original sin as Robert Penn Warren sees Coleridge's poem;8 nor does it contain the neurotic guilt which William Empson posits as part of the Mariner's burden.9 Mosollamus is quite proud of his action. He has a motive and mes- sage. His jealous God has commanded him: Thou shalt have no other Gods before me. (Ex:20:3) This is the first commandment and all the evidence in Leviticus and Deuteronomy points to its over- whelming importance. Admonitions against signs, portents, ora- cles, auguries, wizards, necromancers and such abound in the Penta- teuch. Such heathen practices lead to the greatest danger-idolatry- the worship of gods other than Jehovah. Mosollamus has practical reasons for his deed; the seer and the auguries are holding up the war. So Mosollamus kills two birds with one arrow, thereby ridding the army of a roadblock and teaching the pagans a Jewish lesson.'0 6 Josephus, Against Apion, trans. H.

Mo- sollamus was sure of himself, sure of his ability as a marksman and sure of his God. The army undoubtedly soon marched again and most likely was victorious. In such a context the killing of the bird is hardly a moral question. Yet no matter how much the poem and the tale differ in tone and characterization, there are telling similarities in action and theme. Most striking is the attitude of the "others" toward the bird. The seer and his fellow Greeks believe the bird's actions are portentous, and that by following the bird a correct decision can be made in relation to the forthcoming battle. In the eyes of the Mariner's companions the arrival of the Albatross is related to the breaking up of the ice. As the glosser tells us, "the Albatross proveth a bird of good omen" (I. 70-5). As the rest of the poem graphically demonstrates, the bird "proveth" nothing of the kind. In the dream/nightmare world of the rime, chance operates with customary neutrality. Two hundred men are killed seemingly to avenge the death of the Albatross while the bird-killer is "saved" from death to serve a "death-in-life" sentence because of a roll of the dice. The Mariner dreams that the reason for vengeance is that the particular bird happens to be the favorite of a peculiar Polar Spirit. It cannot be assumed that the bird, though friendly, was a good omen. In Coleridge's poetic world the laws of cause and effect are frequently suspended in order to allow for poetic impact. Like the soldiers in Hecataeus' tale, the mariners and the glosser appear to be incorrect about bird prophecy. In poetic fact, the mariners are punished just because they are superstitious about the bird. The poem records no immediate reaction to the slaying of the Albatross. Coleridge gives the impression of time passing (II. 82-90). The mariners, literal fair weather friends, change their minds about the bird and the deed when the wind blows or the fog appears. They leap to simplistic cause-effect conclusions. "Jewish joke." Rabbi Nachman wams that "all scoffing is forbidden except scoffing at idols which is permitted." The Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin, ed. Isador Epstein, trans. H. Freedman (London: Soncino 1935), I, 63. A well-known Talmudic tale is equally iconoclastic. Abraham as a young boy smashes every one of his father's idols except one, in whose hands he places a stick. When the father asks who did the idol smash- ing Abraham says it was the idol with the stick in his hands. The father says "But these gods can't do anything!" And Abraham says "Let your ears hear what your mouth is saying."</page><page sequence="5">Dorothy Bilik 91 For all averred, I had killed the bird That made the breeze to blow. Ah wretch! said they, the bird to slay, That made the breeze to blow! (II- 93-6) After the wind shifts, Then all averred, I had killed the bird That brought the fog and mist 'Twas right, said they, such birds to slay That bring the fog and mist. (II. 99-102) The almost sing-song repetition, the twinned diction, the internal rhyme and the heavy use of monosyllables contribute to an effect of nursery rhyme simplicity and superficiality. The childish solipsism of the mariner's response is made manifest in their callous opportunism which has no concern for the bird except as it might affect them. The mariners are described by the glosser as "accomplices in the crime" because of their perfidy. But the crime involved is more seri- ous than opportunism, at least according to the Pentateuch. Like the soldiers in the earlier tale, the mariners stand accused of anthropo- morphism and idolatry. The Albatross was hailed "as if it had been a Christian soul" (I. 65), and it is fed human food. What the mariners admire about the Albatross are what they consider to be its human qualities, with all the condescension involved in the relationship of an owner to a pet. They domesticate the wild, innocent creature. Then they anthropomorphically ascribe religious motives to the pres- ence of the bird. Even for the pious glosser the Albatross becomes "the pious bird of good omen" which, in traditional religious terms, is idolatrous. Paradoxically, the "fair breeze" which the mariners now childishly attribute to the death of the Albatross (II. 103) enables the company to perform the Promethean action of being "the first that ever burst / Into that silent sea" (II. 105-6). Even here the internal rhyme com- bines solipsisrm with the pride of discovery. The hubris of being "first," usually a mixed curse, is related to the egocentricity of the attitude toward the Albatross. The mariners do not punish the Ancient Mariner for his action until well after the killing of the bird and the entry into the silent sea. Only after natural calamities dog their ship do they elect the Mariner</page><page sequence="6">92 losephus and the Ancient Mariner scapegoat. In their primitive, simplistic and superstitious action they are attempting to absolve themselves and thereby pacify the various deities they feel they have offended. Ironically, instead of sacrificing the Mariner to appease a group of angry deities, they are themselves sacrificed. "Even the worship of one God becomes idolatry in my convic- tions," says Coleridge, "when instead of the Eternal &amp; Omnipresent, in whom we live and move, and have our Being, we set up a distinct Jehovah tricked out in the anthropomorphic Attributes of Time &amp; Suc- cessive Thoughts-&amp; think of him, as a PERSON from whom we had our Being. The tendency to Idolatry seems to me to lie at the root of all our human Vices-it is our Original Sin."" William Marshall looks at The Rime of the Ancient Mariner in relation to these comments. For a few years following the composition of the poem Coleridge still re- garded anthropomorphism or any notion of a personal deity as a form of idolatry.... By anthropomorphism Coleridge appears to have meant animism as well. Actually they are similar in that each confuses levels of being: in anthropomorphism one moves downward from the idea of God to the image of man, and in animism one moves upward from the sensation of object to the image of animal or (in personification) of man."2 Marshall also cites a frequently omitted section of Coleridge's famous comments to Mrs. Barbauld. Coleridge demurs when Mrs. Barbauld finds no moral in the Rime, "the only fault in the poem is that there is too much. In a work of such pure imagination I ought not to have stopped to give reasons for things, or inclucate [sic] humanity to beasts."'3 The need "to give reasons for things" is the Mariner's rather than Coleridge's. Marshall stresses the irony of the simple, primitive Mari- ner's understanding of his experience and its distinct difference from Coleridge's. Robert Penn Warren's important essay does not concern itself with irony but it does point out the relation between Cole- ridge's thoughts on idolatry and the action of the poem. Warren de- scribes the Mariner's deed as a crime against Nature and hence against God. Warren cites Coleridge's observations on Man's "Satanic lt Letter to John Prior Estlin, 7 December 1802, Griggs, Vol. 2, 893.

For the 1796 notebook entries from Josephus indicate that Coleridge was reading about Nimrod who was perhaps the first Bibilical embodiment of the secu- larization of power. The sons of Noah, according to Josephus, were incited by Nimrod to believe that they alone were responsible for their happiness and plenty. Nimrod wanted to turn men away from the fear of God and to bring them into his power. 15 Not unlike Warren, M. H. Abrams associates the slaying of the Albatross with "the Mariner's prideful self-sufficiency, his readiness to cut himself off from the universal community of life and love."'6 In a sense the Mariner's "god-like" act enables the ship and its crew to perform the Promethean action of discovering the Pacific. The Mari- ner says proudly "we were the first." Coleridge's characterization of idolatry as "Original Sin" and "Satanic" may influence him toward a negative view of the discovery. That characteristically Coleridgean fear and ambivalence toward creativity that is manifested in Kubla Khan may also be manifested here. In contrast to Mosollamus' icono- clasm, neither "godlike" action (neither slaying nor discovery) is done in God's name. Jehovah is the jealous God when man dares to usurp God-like functions, and the Hebraic context of the poem has been noted by many. Frederick Pottle notes that the rime "is not unlike a story from the Old Testament recording the exceeding fierce wrath of the Lord; for example, how He smote the men of Bethshemesh because, through no malice at all, they had looked into the ark."'7 And Edward Bot- stetter says in reference to the throw of the dice determining life and death: "The Moral conception here is primitive and savage-utterly 14 The Statesman's Manual in The Complete Works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, ed.

In the dream, the typically Coleridgean evasion, the Mariner "learns" that the death of the Albatross is being avenged by the Polar Spirit-hardly a surrogate for Jehovah. The Mariner needs reasons; for Coleridge to ascribe such "reasons" to God would be idolatrous. And it is idola- try, in its animistic and anthropomorphic forms and in its manifesta- tion as human hubris, that is being avenged in the poem. Arbitrary boundaries have been transgressed but they have not been recog- nized as boundaries until after they have been violated. Paradoxically, despite the "evil" of the Mariner's deed there is something in it of felix culpa, a fortunate fall which gives him more wisdom than his companions who die unshrieved and in ignorance. The Mariner does not attribute magic powers of weather control to the Albatross. Although he does say "'As if it had been a Christian soul, / We hailed it in God's name" he does not appear to participate in the domesticating of the bird. "It ate the food it ne'er had eat" (II. 67) replaced the earlier version "The Mariners gave it biscuit worms." The Mariner seems isolated from his companions even before the action. Perversely, although he kills the Albatross, he does not at- tempt to exploit the bird for human purposes. The mariner may not necessarily be an unwitting instrument of Jehovah's wrath but he is moving, albeit with some loss, from paganism to piety. Within the Hebraic tradition, man and nature are differentiated. Nature within the poem, with its ice storms, deadly calms, and treacherous winds, is neither benign nor subservient to man. These natural phenomena take place in the transgression areas where man does not usually venture. The "Hermit good" who represents a kind of norm in the poem, is specifically depicted as living in harmony with nature, in the wood with moss as his cushion. When the ear- splitting sounds "split the bay," when the terrifying figure of the Mariner emerges from the strangely sinking ship, the Pilot falls into a fit, the Pilot's boy "doth crazy go"-but the Hermit prays. The Hermit has already described the natural universe where he is at home where "the owlet whoops to the wolf below / That eats the she-wolf's young" (VII.536-7). The Hermit neither condemns nor ap- proves. All of nature is accepted for what it is. 18 "The Nightmare World of the Ancient Mariner," Tuxntieth Century Views: Coleridge, A Collection of Critical Essays, ed.

He prayeth best, who loveth best All things both great and small For the dear God who loveth us, He made and loveth all. The Mariner's "moral" presents a God who does not appear in the Mariner's universe as experienced within the poem. He persists in creating God in his own image and may thus still be idolatrous. However, he is now passive rather than active, humble rather than proud, accepting rather than questioning. Within the world of the poem, the love that he expresses at its end is arbitrary like his "crime." After the violence and the terror, the Mariner's sense of his experience is inadequate and anticlimactic. Such is the perception of a simple, primitive and frightened man in need of explanation. The Mariner's simplicity and need for a moral contribute to the wedding guest's wisdom and sorrow. The Mariner, no wise man, taught better than he knew. The more fortunate reader experiences the extraordinary power of the poem that transcends its sources, analyses and even its deconstruction. To the distinguished company which includes Cain and other di- verse wanderers, the Old Navigator and other sailors, Nimrod and other hunters may be added the cavalryman-archer Mosollamus who, transformed by Coleridge's shaping powers of imagination, adds a paradoxically orthodox yet outrageous quality that represents a similar paradox in Josephus, the Ancient Mariner, and, most im- portant, in his creator.'9 University of Maryland i9 A Coleridgean controversy surrounds the authenticity of Josephus' source for the story of Mosollamus. Ben Zion Wacholder, writing in the Encyclopedia Judaica (Jerusa- lem, 1971), ascribes the Mosollamus story to Pseudo-Hecataeus I, an ardent Jew who took on the identity of the Greek historian in order to counteract the anti-Semitism of the time. Menahem Stern in a more recent study (Greek and Latin Authors on Jews and Judaism, Jerusalem, 1974, 21-5), offers extensive evidence for Josephus' use of a slightly revised version of the authentic book of Hecataeus. The creator of Satyrane's letters and the "person from Porlock" who himself used the pseudonym Silas Tomkyn Comberbacke, would have appreciated the controversy surrounding the authenticity of Mosollamus.</page></plain_text>
