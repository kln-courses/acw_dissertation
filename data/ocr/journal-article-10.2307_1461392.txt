<plain_text><page sequence="1">Garry Wills' Sour Birds An Essay Review* JUSTUS GEORGE LAWLER In his recent survey of the past quarter century of Catholicism, Garry Wills joins that long line of revisionist thinkers whose new philosophy peren- nially puts all things in doubt. Every- thing that the Catholic in the pew might have thought to represent the achievement of the sixties--decline of Roman triumphalism, new modes of worship, humanization of sexuality, freedom of expression-all these, rath- er than being lauded as victories are dismissed or denigrated as trivial or subversive. Not unlike Dio Chryso- stom trying to prove that Homer lied about Troy's defeat, Mr. Wills mar- shalls a formidable array of rhetoric in support of his own singular thesis on the burning of Rome's topless towers. That thesis, with multiple ramifi- cations, is that the crisis in Roman Catholicism is the result not so much of the credibility gap which the hier- archy perpetrated as the gullibility trap into which "liberals" fell-a thesis clearly congruent with James Hitch- cock's Decline and Fall of Radical Catholicism which Mr. Wills excori- ated-the uncharitable will be tempted to believe--lest his own singularity be impeached. The major difference be- tween the two is that Mr. Hitchcock names names while Mr. Wills depends heavily on hypostatized abstractions, "liberal Catholicism," "the Movement," etc.. Now, it is true as Toynbee wrote in A Study of History that, "It is hard- ly possible to write two consecutive lines of historical narrative without in- troducing such fictitious personifica- tions as 'England,' 'France,' 'The Con- servative Party,' 'The Church' ... ." This is true; but it is equally true that this attribution of interiority and self direction to abstractions or artificial constructs leads to the victory of poetry over truth, of historicism over history. It is the favorite device of propagan- dists: "Communism is intrinsically evil," "Russia is intent on world con- quest," etc.. Or to cite one of Mr. Wills' own contributions to the genre: "In the wake of Vietnam, America, which has been very skilled in certi- tudes throughout its history, has be- come a new Rome capable of self- doubt."

JAAR XLI/1 (March 1973) @ AAR</page><page sequence="2">GARY WILLS' SOUR BIRDS 123 which I shall return shortly, has affini- ties with Mr. Wills' methodology which is to take the headlines and cliches, the slogans and stereotypes of the sixties, exalt them to the status of hard data, principles, axioms and then, in their apotheosized condition, sub- ject them to an elaborate exegesis-the latter more or less after the fashion of an old-style preacher exhaustively min- ing for moral content a single verse of the gospel or of a New Critic explicat- ing a line of Marvell. Generally one can't fault the exegesis which is Scho- lastic to an extreme. But one does re- peatedly question its subjects which are nothing but the encapsulations of shorthand journalism. Wills' muse it seems is to be invoked under the title, Clio of the Bumper Sticker. Thus is taken with Teutonic seriousness the "datum" that there are two transcen- dentally related Johns, F. Kennedy and XXIII, as well as two wahlverwandt- schaftlich linked Jackies, Grennan and nee Bouvier; and the mysterious nexus (like Byron's March hare and May heroine) along with each pole is ela- borately dissected. Since the basis for these conjoin- ings is so tenuous and slight, one can- not regard this as just the kind of parallel-drawing Lord Acton warned Mary Gladstone about as the besetting temptation of all historians. The link- age is so nominal that it puts one in mind of the mnemonic tags of children or the phonic pairings of the primitive. We seem to have to do here with McLuhanite history, non-linear and oral-and, one might add, hardly the way to compose annals. Apparently Mr. Wills, having rejected the ex opere operato "magic" of ecclesiastical sacra- ments-like so many others fleeing institutional churches for media-mys- ticism and the occult-has embraced "sympathetic magic": the doctrine that ancient herbalists called "signa- ture," e.g., nutmeg looks like the hu- man brain, therefore nutmeg is good for the brain. "Catholics had the Pope, their own John, to balance against 'secular John' in the White House. But for a while they had no Jackie." Ergo out of the cosmic matrix of history: Enter Grennan. (To the matter of neo- primitivism I shall return when con- sidering Mr. Wills' final injunction, "It is time to join the underground.") If on the one hand the shadow of The Gutenberg Galaxy hovers over and mars chis chronicle, then on the other (and more disturbingly), is the tragedy of its debt to Orwell's Ministry of Truth. It is only too bad that every hallucination publicitaire of the sixties is taken with such high seriousness that what Newsweek or Life or NBC commemmorated or fabricated then is regarded as fact now. But it is a misfortune of considerably greater magnitude that significant events and entire movements of thought go un- recorded and, indeed, are consciously suppressed-much after the fashion of Soviet Encyclopedists. When Mr. Wills bemoans the subterfuges of American hierarchs and Roman pon- tiffs, he ought to reflect upon his own debt as chronicler to the spirit of Stalinisme pio-duodecimal. Let us begin at the beginning. Fac- ing Mr. Wills' title page is a list of his other works, but with one remarkable omission, a volume of over three hun-</page><page sequence="3">124 JUSTUS GEORGE LAWLER dred pages, and by title and time of publication highly prime to his pre- sent purpose: Politics and Catholic Freedom, 1964-but a public embarass- ment for a burrower to the under- ground, since the book along with his period pieces abundantly, almost wan- tonly, documents Mr. Wills' own reac- tionary views and role during the greater part of the sixties when, as pro- teg6 of William Buckley, Jr., he was a fan of the latter's solipsistic prosings and connings, as well as implicit de- fender of some of his less venial extrav- agances. One of these was Mr. Buck- ley's suggestion that John XXIII's Mater et Magistra "must strike many as a venture in triviality coming at this particular time in history" - "This par- ticular time" being the period of the Cool War which Buckley characteristi- cally was trying to re-refrigerate. Wills' book taking off from the ensuing con- troversy not only displays his views and role during the sixties, it also illustrates his tactics-which have, unfortunately, perdured into the seventies. Thus in Bare Ruined Choirs he re- fers to my writing "in a book on Mater et Magistra, that the 'mandate of the encyclical' reaches to such duties as op- position to Operation Abolition . .." (my emphasis); whereas in Politics and Catholic Freedom he clearly acknowl- edged that my words were patient of the meaning I obviously intended-- which was that such opposition re- presented one kind of " 'translation' of doctrine into action which the Pope advocates." Similarly, Wills notes in the present book that "William Clancy [of CRIA] ... stated the ground rules for using papal encyclicals as follows: 'The clear, over-all direction of papal teaching on political-social problems has been in the general direction of what we in this country, rather loosely, for lack of a better term, called "lib- eral".' " Thus a purely descriptive his- torical judgment to which no one, in- cluding Mr. Buckley, could take excep- tion is transmogrified into a "ground rule for using" encyclicals; and Clancy, like Lawler (among other "liberals") is indicted as a dogmatic inquisitor force- fully imposing his narrow views on all Christians. It would be to exhume dead issues (matricide and magistricide) to go into the faulty illations, the deletions, the distortions that blot Wills' earlier argu- ment; and since the present book pro- vides enough examples of these flaws we can concentrate on it. (I observe in passing that Mr. Wills makes jest of Harvey Cox's Secular City with its red jacket as "the little red book" of "Catholic liberals."-an intriguing heuristic here. May one note that the stealthily excised Politics and Catholic Freedom is covered in blushingly bril- liant scarlet?) As I have said, one would never imagine from Mr. Wills' omissive his- torical reconstruction that he himself was an actor in the drama he is now narrating. When he asserts that "Fa- ther Andrew Greeley, would-be canon- izer of Jack Kennedy, became Daniel Berrigan's leading denigrator"--when he so asserts, who would imagine that Garry Wills, would-be canonizer of Daniel Berrigan now was one of his leading denigrators then? And since that "then" encompasses a major por- tion of the period covered in this</page><page sequence="4">GARY WILLS' SOUR BIRDS 125 book, and since Mr. Wills was a major figure in developments during that period, one wonders why mere jour- nalistic integrity wouldn't demand the same public scrutiny of his own deeds that he brings to bear so truculently on those of others. Most remarkably of all, in his cavalier attribution of guilt to the "liberals" for the follies of the Vietnam war-follies that Mr. Wills only very tardily recognized-- there is no mention of the impetus that war consistently received from the florid bellicosity of his associates at National Review. Mr. Wills, of course, has since un- dergone a dramatic metanoia, from defender of Buckleyism to defender of Berriganism; but where one might ex- pect maybe penitence or maybe mere acknowledgment, there is only hector- ing and bravado. The reader is left to assume that Wills' volte-faced repre- sented merely the organic and virtually imperceptible development (if there was any development at all) of a single line of thought. In fact, when writing of the necessity for change ("aggiorna- mento" to use the despised term of Mr. Wills' rightist years) in religious life during the seventies, he betrays precisely such imagined immutability. In a homely and heavy-handed aside he rails at opponents of change: "It is as if I should look at my ten-year-old son and attack him: 'You are not the nine- pound infant I brought home from the hospital.' For that matter, my wife is not the same girl I married (what right had she to change?), nor I the boy [boy!] who married her (how unfair that I had to change, IF I have)." The italics are Mr. Wills' (the caps are mine), and the exemplum betrays the depths of this quirk for concealing his own private intellectual revolution. Now, it would be unkind to up- braid Mr. Wills for the dilatoriness of his moral alteration. Was not Paul the greatest and the last of the apostles, and does not Thomas Browne warn that "festination may prove precipita- tion"? So, certainly "liberals" must wel- come Mr. Wills to the happy realms of light, and applaud his gargantuan leap of faith from reaction to radi- calism-which, on examination, may not exactly make him an ideological Evel Knievel, since the leap turns out to be merely from one simplism to another. Moreover, not only has he en- tered the liberal temple, he has vaulted into the very sanctum, and display- ing the zeal of all conversi has out- Berriganed the Berrigans-even to now engaging in those surrealist ges- tures whereby one courts jailing (but not for any more time than convention- ally sobers a drunk in the clink) for picketing Pentagon or White House; all, if I recall correctly, that one may respond ingratiatingly to the query, "Daddy, what did you do to end the war?" Or should that be Dada? Truly it would be unkind to upbraid him for past cunctation in the light of present heroicity. But it is certainly not unkind to observe as a matter of the history he is so diligently chronicling that it was he, from his various pinnacles of edi- torial eminence (National Catholic Reporter, National Review, etc.) who once condemned Berriganism for "fo- menting" intolerable rebellion: "This is the point at which martyrs or pro-</page><page sequence="5">126 JUSTUS GEORGE LAWLER phets become rebels. In the name of conscientious objection, they are assert- ing a right to sabotage. They declare a practical aim-to stop an action legiti- mate authority is conducting." When in a lengthy critique of these judg- ments (Continuum, Spring, 1965), I compared Mr. Wills' attacking Daniel Berrigan to a mousing owl hunting a falcon, who would have conceived that a few years later he should be flying in that same formation-proving per- haps thereby the truth of one of those Teilhardian maxims he repeatedly de- rides: everything that rises converges. Not for nothing is this the year of Jonathan Livingston Seagull. One must allow benefit of all pos- sible doubts; such lacunae may re- sult merely from lapse of memory. Some conversions, psychiatrists tell us, are like electroshock therapy, obliter- ative of the past. But it is more likely that what Mr. Wills is indulging in his slanting recital is what Sean O'Fao- lain called "postcogitation." O'Faolain had reference to Cardinal Newman's revisionary autobiographical rumina- tions-and Newman, one recalls, is still one of Wills' ideals. Thus it may be that his dismal autopsy of those days which were for almost every Catholic like those of Wordsworth at the re- volution ("bliss to be alive . . . very heaven") represents nothing more than a case of sour grapes; nothing more--to badly parse-than tristis post cogitum. Although it may indeed be all of these things, I think it is possible to precision more finely what actually is at play here by an examination of Mr. Wills' justly praised style. The attri- bute is "cool," and the celebrant, Thomas Wolfe. Apparently the Ar- noldian touchstone would be Talley- rand's pas de zele. But then one is hauled up short by the irony that that might be the very motto of the famed Kennedy Mafia or of Secretary Mc- Namara, both frequently roasted by Mr. Wills. Is it possible that the de- spised liberalism of the sixties could constitute the proper analogue to Mr. Wills' stylistic finesse, so that the drift of Thomas Wolfe's imprimatur mir- rors exactly Wills' condemnation of the Kennedy regime: "the new style was . . cool, detached, yet mobile"? It would hardly be surprising, then, if this rhetoric reeked of the same hau- teur, the same superbia that was so noi- some in the Defense Department Whiz Kids or in the life-style of Robert Kennedy as seen through the eyes of Jimmy Hoffa-and Garry Wills. Nor is all this a mere matter of the nuances of Wills' prose, of occasional inadvertant lapses into hubris; rather it is structured into the texture of his entire book. The airs of arrogance here ascend from the printed page like great billowing and obscuring clouds of in- cense, so that (to use a churchy image from those Missal prayers Wills scores) descendat super nos miseri- cordia tua: or, loosely translated, God help us, if this is the necessary ap- proach to comprehending our past his- tory. First, some instances of Mr. Wills move from the central city of straight reportage to superbia; and then, an analysis of the style itself. (My em- phases throughout) Item. "Even Mai- sie Ward's didactic publishing house</page><page sequence="6">GARY WILLS' SOUR BIRDS 127 provided a place for exseminarians like Philip Scharper to carry on a specific 'apostolate.' " No mention here or elsewhere of exseminarians like Garry Wills carrying out their aposto- late at the didactic (albeit with a leer, a smirk, and a grimace) National Re- view. Item. "When National Review quoted a crack as 'going the rounds in Catholic conservative circles'-Mater, si; Magistra, no!-the liberal press rose to Savonarolan heights at the treatment of papal injunctions with such levity." (Where else would "levity" be han- dled but on the "heights"?) But noth- ing here about the fact that the crack originated with Garry Wills, then al- most sole occupant of those "Catholic conservative circles." Item A ". . . the cozy little world of instantly acclaimed 'intellectuals' known as Commonweal Catholics." Item. "Catholic liberals went giddy with surprised fulfillment listening to others praise 'their' Presi- dent. Item. "Another orgy of ecumeni- cal praise was indulged in, two years later, when John XXIII issued his encyclical ... ." Savonarolan tactics, instant acclamations, giddiness, orgies -strange comportings for those whose "style was . .. cool, detached, yet mo- bile." So much for the apophasis (though the best is too long to cite, covering two paragraphs on pp. 93-4) and the hyperbole-both basic ingredi- ents in the lingo of superbinites. Let us look now at some of the non-sequiturs and tautologies: equally basic ingredients. Item. Harvey Cox is quoted, "The fact is that man is placed in an environment of problems which he is called to master." Wills without a break explicitates: "Thus a well-planned poverty program would solve the city's problems, just as cor- rectly graduated force would settle the problem of Vietnam" (note also, the neo-primitivism of the entirely gratui- tous parallel). But here too the ironies keep doubling back, since Wills' ap- praisal of poverty programs is identi- cal with Richard Nixon's immediately after the last election: remember, "... the solutions of the sixties were massive failures. They threw money at problems and for the most part they failed." If Nixon agonistes is, as Wills taught us to believe, the last of the liberals, then Mr. Wills is second to last. Item. "... the priest was forced to pray an hour daily from a latin book that was no book, but the summary of a monk's day of chanted prayer." Clearly a summary is never a book; like that Tanquerey Synopsis Theolo- giae ... Wills the seminarian drank in. Item. Of encyclicals: "What ma- gic was in these documents, most named after their opening words, writ- ten in stilted Renaissance Latin of the papal courts? Nothing intrinsic." How about some extrinsic magic? Item. On celibate "suppression of sexual love": "This amounts to systematic undermin- ing of all kinds of love, which are all, in their own way, sexual, since they all have to do with one's sense of self, and therefore with sexual identity." As they used to say in vaudeville (voodooville?), "Love me, love my dog"-for Mr. Wills that would pre- sumably entail the "sin of bestiality." The tautology that caps, clears, and clinches all has to do with church cen- sorship: "evil books were not rejected because they were evil (if they were</page><page sequence="7">128 JUSTUS GEORGE LAWLER evil) but because, being evil, they were implicitly legislated against by the church." This may be what is meant by "Catholic conservative circles." In much of this Mr. Wills has scavenged up the right dirt; sexual suppression, censorship, etc., are con- temptible. But his mode of condem- nation is scarcely calculated to instill confidence in his analysis of more com- plex issues. Perhaps his cheapest dis- tortions have to do with Teilhard who, along with Kennedy, is the villain of the era. Here Wills' cool fails to come to his aid, and one is reminded of Andrew Jackson's last regrets that he was unable to shoot Henry Clay or hang John C. Calhoun. Since we are still in the phase of rhetorical analy- sis, I shall provide only a couple of instances, reserving for later a fuller treatment of Wills on Teilhard. Wills quotes Teilhard: "What fascinates me in life is being able to collaborate in a task." The boundless non sequitur of the very next sentence links the two bogeys: "So Kennedy called in the ex- perts, Harvard with its dissertations, MIT with its slide rules, the Ford Cor- poration with its computers." Or, of Teilhard's military service: "The war's impact, felt in the mud and squalor of serving mangled men, was oddly consolatory." One wonders why a ded- icated religious should not find con- solation in the service of the wounded. Wills' most exuberant rhetorical fling comes in a running commentary on an allocution of Jacqueline Gren- nan. Since Sister Grennan rarely de- viated into sense, Wills' achievement is not exactly herculean. The com- mentary proves to be a long-winded diversion which never pains but it bores. And it should be said that Mr. Wills, who can talk about "female heroines", is not perhaps the best ex- emplar of Attic grace-which indeed he may equate with writing on the heights or even in the loft. In any case, Jacqueline Grennan was never taken very seriously, except in the six- ties by Life, and in the seventies by Wills. But if the style is the man, we have here in all these examples a key to understanding Wills' own peculiar Denkform as well as the olympian hauteur of his book. In assaying the implications of this style, I do not want to engage in the kind of exercise in neurogenesis Wills undertakes with the writings of Teilhard. As noted, Wills suffered a profound transforma- tion some time in the sixties from convinced conservative to passionate, even aggressive radical; symbolically, from the pages of the Modern School- man to the pages of Playboy. Now it is impossible to believe that this transformation occurred overnight. Rather, one assumes that for a consi- derable time he was in a state of dubiety, that is literally in a state of duality, split between loyalty to his past opinions and opinion-makers (only last year Buckley publicly called him a "turncoat") and the lure of the revolutionary evangel. Suspended be- tween these extremes of frigid cold and white heat, he could not but assume a posture of detachment, superiority, coolness - much like a nineteenth-cen- tury Puseyite whose hankerings after Rome were not quite strong enough for conversion but whose hatred of</page><page sequence="8">GARY WILLS' SOUR BIRDS 129 Protestantism would not allow him to return to the old "two-bottle ortho- doxy", in this case the orthodoxy of National Review. Divided thus within himself Wills was incapable of judging one way or the other, though occasionally he fell into arrant opinion-mongering and delivered himself of arbitrary and self- contradictory pronunciamentos. In this condition where two wills make a won't (exactly the logical argument of the Monotheletes), Wills' state approx- imated that of the classic esthete who, because of his chilly remoteness, re- duces everything to a spectacle of mas- sive impersonal forces. Whence, too, the hypostatization encountered earlier: "the liberal press," "Commonweal Catholics," etc., are pre-defined entities moving undeviatingly towards their fated destinies. In this bloc-headed ap- proach the imperative of the great cul- ture-historian Johann Huizinga-"de- liver us from all anthropomorphism" -cannot but be ignored as the most divergent personalities and viewpoints are heaped together in some ungranu- lated lump that becomes self-contained, self-operative, self-moving. Wills' estheticism also explains his compulsive use of parallels. For a last example: "With Humanae Vitae ... Paul VI did to his reign what Lyndon Johnson did with the Vietnam war." That, one fears, is art, not history. All categories look gray in this cloudy dark night of the judgment, and everything Wills wants to roast provides only more mist for his grill. Lastly, the esthete's preoccupation with spectacle over plot, drama over history, facade over interior, allows him to bypass the substance while inflating for purely dramatic effect shadows and images. Teilhard's complexification is simply wiped out in a few strokes of the pen. One could even hazard the generaliza- tion that the esthete will almost in- variably cultivate a highly refined rhetorical style (Puseyites were very strong on ritual and ceremony). Be- cause he gives so little attention to the snarled skein of reality, all the esthete's energies are free to be channeled to the intricacies of the surface, to polish- ing the periphery. In this light, Wills can be diagnosed as still suffering from the veneer disease of the terribles sim- plificateurs of National Review whose sophistry is akin to the program of New Realism in painting (as Wills would say, NR = NR): the most elaborate technical skills are devoted to nothing other than the exact redupli- cation of photographs. True, all expository prose requires detachment, "distancing," some kind of objective correlating. But the usual devisal, say with a Kempton, is to en- list analogies from history-as most recently Kempton comparing the psychological wrestlings of Ellsberg with those of Newman. Here one achieves detachment on a temporal, not a spatial scale; and the resulting irony engenders historical enlighten- ment, not esthetic entertainment. Un- fortunately Mr. Wills, though one imagines he imagines he is emulating Kempton, and though he is certainly more learned than most of the new journalists (after all, how many ex- Jesuits write for Esquire?), just doesn't know enough history to bring the feat off. Here, as certification and as speed-</page><page sequence="9">130 JUSTUS GEORGE LAWLER ily as possible, the mandatory cata- log of factual errors: Rabbi Abraham Herschel, Albert Delp, Haeckel's Ver- gil, Cardinal Dupanloup; Br6mond and Gide are "philosophers"; Claudel converts at "High Mass"; Le Fort writes "Song of the Scaffold" (a reveal- ing anthropomorphism); Berdyaev is Catholic; Guardini and de Lubac try to make Rilke and Dostoyevsky "or- thodox"; etc.,-all this perhaps illustra- tive only of the inertial drift afflict- ing all voyagers in these strange seas of thought. But where one would ex- pect the helpful historical analogy, it rarely comes. One muses at the use Wills might have made of Bossuet's, "I have God, the king, and Mme. de Maintenon on my side" (think of Bil- ly Graham, Nixon, and Mme. Chen- ault). Similarly when analogizing Paul's lamination of Church and pa- pacy, Wills comes up with the under- graduate editorialist's "L'Tglise, c'est moi," rather than the factual and there- fore historically illuminating Pio No- no's "lo sono tradizione." Interestingly, Mr. Wills' most am- bitious study in parallels (and here I make the transition from matters of style broadly conceived to matters of substance) is in a textual study of Teilhard's writings and those of Msgr. R. H. Benson. Now, it is well known to all students of Teilhard that his imagery owes something to that of Benson. But then the imagery of both owes something to the whole composite library of religious and mystical writ- ings down through the ages. Wills in- forms us-somewhat breathlessly- that both Teilhard and Benson imag- ined the priest as mediator "of Crea- tion's need and God's grace"; not very telling, after all, since the notion is at least as hoary as Leviticus. "Another strong element in Benson is a belief in prayer, spiritual aspiration, and the strivings of the mind as palpable pre- sences"; and ditto with Teilhard-but, alas, ditto with Blake and Boehme and scores of others. In some language in Benson about electricity running ma- chines and prayer running the ma- chine of the world, Wills finds "the germ of another Teilhardian image." But the germ was epidemic, and Mar- xists like Day Lewis a generation later would use it to describe the spread of their ideology, even as Hopkins a gen- eration before used it of "God's grandeur" ("to reck his rod" for Hop- kins meant to be in touch with the ter- minals of the divine battery). In death both real and mystical, for Ben- son "anguish and ecstasy were one"; so too with Teilhard. But so too with every annotator of Plotinus from Pseudo-Dionysius on. As a conse- quence, one is not quite sure what Mr. Wills' exercise is supposed to suggest, except perhaps to find Teilhard guilty of associating with a known "scrib- bler," "aesthete of the fin de sidcle," "bagger" of souls for Rome, etc.. Much is made of Teilhard's ex- perience of the burning of his own hair as a child, the mood of frangi- bility this engendered, and his realiza- tion of personal mortality. ". .. A wound had been given--one around which all his thought would, like layer on layer of scar tissue, be built up in ridged intricate hardness." One doesn't know exactly what is so vexatious here. The experience that one is per-</page><page sequence="10">GARY WILLS' SOUR BIRDS 131 ishable must be the point of departure for virtually all philosophy, all art, everything truly human. Comes then some fine Hollywood writing: "Com- pared to iron and stone, he was being hourly devoured; his breath was fuel to his own fires, became the fire-he was a fire; the quicker he flared, the quicker he would fade"-again, an un- exceptionable experience treated as though it were neurotic, and a com- monplace image from Heraclitus through Pascal (even through Hop- kins again), treated as though it were exotic. In fact the same image occurs in that queer sonnet by Shakespeare from which Mr. Wills derives his title. Certainly no one questions that Teilhard uttered a lot of nonsense; who hasn't? (De te fabula, Mr. Wills.) But the nonsense is not what rubbed off on a whole generation from the fifties to the seventies. Teilhard in The Divine Milieu showed the Chris- tian that his work in the world was not divisive, that the engineer, the poli- tician, the journalist when doing well what they did were by that fact ful- filling their religious and human voca- tion. The Phenomenon of Man opened up to both Christians and non-Chris- tians the perspective of an evolu- tion in which they were an essential element. If one thinks back to the spirituality and "Christian anthropol- ogy" of the first third of this century, Teilhard's achievement stands as no small thing-certainly as no mean thing. Mr. Wills' treatment of Teilhard echoes that of Thomas Molnar or Tri- umph; and one is not sure the ranting tone comes from the fact that Secretary McNamara allegedly read Teilhard, or that Teilhard allegedly influenced the Secretary-possibly a distinction with- out a difference since, after all, they are both to be classified as "liberals." In his concluding sentence, Wills announ- ces that Teilhard "became the posthu- mous theologian to Camelot" (more or less, one may illate, as Mr. Wills has become scholar in residence at Playboy where Hugh Hefner reads him). But there are more villains under- foot than just Teilhard and the Ken- nedyites: the bare ruined choirs are full of vultures, shrikes, and cuckoos- technocrats, instant intellectuals, and Jackie Grennans. And true to Wills' anthropomorphic bias, many of these villains will be "abstractions given head"-the words are Stevens defining poetry. Chief among such abstractions is "Latin," which is center stage throughout much of this melodrama; though really, we are not talking about Latin but "Church Latin" which-an- other howling oxymoron - was a "lan- guage that was no language at all - a weird mix of patristic translatorese, mediaeval hymns, and Renaissance (or Pseudo-Renaissance) petitions called 'collects.' " So much for that non- language-language employed by such tasteless victims of translatorese et cetera as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven et al. "One effect, therefore, of Latin training was to make current thought and debate impossible"-as at Vatican II, or among the last ten British prime ministers, or among all those theologi- ans Wills elsewhere cites, Congar, Lonergan, de Lubac, Murray, Rahner, etc.. The weight Wills invests in the destructive power of Latin is elephan- tine. Priests are "Prisoners of Latin"</page><page sequence="11">132 JUSTUS GEORGE LAWLER who have "been schooled to think (or feign thinking) in doctrinal tags and Latin formulae" (N.B., not "formulas" -and as though vernacular tags would be an improvement). Every concei- vable shade of infidelity, every doubt experienced by believers of every re- ligion is here attached to Latin. "Try- ing to believe for others, make others believe, make excuses for believing, find less belief than yours to scourge-- all this built for the mind a labyrinth that doubt was not supposed to pene- trate. And the concrete form this laby- rinth took was the Latin liturgy." Those of us untrained in classics, and who wouldn't know our elbow from our aorist, not perceiving the gravamen of this, will be inclined to wonder whether Latin may not be too slight and fragile a vessel to bear this immense cargo of causality. We may even be inclined to learn from Mr. Wills elsewhere, and think that possib- ly he--like Teilhard-underwent some traumatizing experience in childhood related to Latin. Maybe some irate nun slapped his cheek for laughing (too much jowel movement - all annals of Catholic upbringing report - brought speedy punishment in parochi- al schools) at the transduction of "Terry's got a snotty nose" from "Te rogamus audi nos"-it was every aco- lyte's pun - and "around that wound, like layer on layer of scar tissue, would be built up in ridged intricate hard- ness" this love-hate neurosis which im- pels one to become both a professor of Latin and its chief derogator. The explanation is no doubt too subtle and too psychoanalytic. It is more likely that all we are witnessing here is an- other example of Mr. Wills' addiction to parallels: the Latin language is a language that declines; a Latin church is a church that declines. (Though one might have difficulty explaining that to the Greek Orthodox.) But it is not just Latin that failed. It was the Latin liturgy; but not just the Latin liturgy, but liturgy as such. And Wills has his jolliest hour regal- ing the reader with descriptions of what liturgy is all about. The prose, attaining the higher peaks of the low- er journalism, is at least worthy of Shelley in Piedmont: The Mass became a hierarchic dance ar- ranged around the Host, bowings, blessings, kneelings, liftings, displayings and hidings of it .... The Host itself was a thing un- like all other bread, or any kind of food- dough baked to a shiny thinness, ["like gold to airy thinness beat"? JGL] then stamped out in flat circles (less than bite- size to forestall chewing); a light disk balanced on one's tongue by the priest, then lifted to the palate by the tongue, there to stick, hard and alien at first, at last dissolv- ing against the taste buds without effect on them--chaste 'supersubstantial' manna, like nothing else, plastic dew fallen from hea- ven . . . The Hosts were hard currency, negotiable stuff of salvation-most of them stamped with a liturgical sign (just like a coin), and each capable of purchasing a soul. Catholics with a memory will find this paragraph as hard to swallow as Mr. Wills' imaginary host. It is true, all ritual acts from "The Magic Flute" to a presidential inaugu- ration tend to perfunctoriness; but re- gardless of the encrusted detritus at- tached to the Mass, for millions it never became the travesty described by Wills. It entailed a "presence," a Shekinah,</page><page sequence="12">GARY WILLS' SOUR BIRDS 133 and it maintained continuity with that "presence" from times, literally im- memorial. Let it be said, too, that now all those bowings, blessings, kneelings, liftings, displayings (shew-bread?), and hidings have been abandoned, there is not much evidence that faith has been commensurately intensified. On the contrary. The faint-brained and hair-hearted services that often have succeeded even the Latin low Mass are capable of being more artificial, more empty precisely as they entail a hypocritical fellowship, forced spon- taneity, compulsory authenticity-all imposed by blue-jeaned, bell-bottomed, turtle-necked ministers, of whom the best one can say is that all that hair seems to have gone to their head. (For most of us, admittedly, a side issue. ) Wills' two best chapters are on the contraception-sexuality debate writ- ten, if I remember rightly, at my sug- gestion for a symposium four years ago. That debate had been pretty well resolved in 1964, so much of Wills' discussion eight years later possesses at least the freshness of, say, the latest photo of the Duchess of Windsor. But Wills proves himself an able theologi- cal polemicist-probably because of his training in Latin. Still, one supposes that since the whole wrangle was so strictly intermural, so quaintly Roman Catholic, it would strike the typical non-Catholic (to say nothing of the typical Playboy reader fondling his center folds) as being about as mean- ingful as a treatment of Ben Zoma's teaching in the Babylonian Talmud. Though it is not inconceivable such readers would assume that a people that could participate in the nods and becks of Wills' low Mass would hardly balk at still arguing in 1972 about primary and secondary ends, cupiditas, per se destinatus, etc.. If it wasn't the breakdown in liturgy, the sexuality debate, and cer- tainly not liberal machinations, nor Teilhardism, nor Kennedyism, nor all the other phantoms in Mr. Wills' opera, if it wasn't any one or all of these that brought about the crisis in Catholicism, what was it? Let me supply a modest theory. The crisis in world Catholicism resulted from the failure to exorcise the ghosts of Trent. Only in the last two decades has Catholicism undergone the kind of humane religious reform that Protestantism has experienced for the past four centuries. In America this crisis was exacerbated by the fact that Catholicism had been the most stable identity factor for several gener- ations of immigrants. With the assi- milation of these immigrants into the larger culture, such identity and such stability were realized through more conventional social instruments, educa- tion, profession, the arts, etc. (Here I would agree entirely with Wills who has written elsewhere that the ethnicity fad is a purely political expedient of short-term utility; or, more bluntly, that "ethnicity" is a code word for "racism.") Religion to the catalytic generation, that is, the generation which has precipitated the crisis in Catholicism, is less the center of exis- tence and more the circumambiance; or, to use one of those execrable Teil- hardisms, religion is the "envelope" in which man lives, moves and is. Its con- tents are something else again.</page><page sequence="13">134 JUSTUS GEORGE LAWLER Though Mr. Wills has told his reader that "we do not solve our pro- blems-we are lucky if we succeed in finding them, learn to live with them, reduce the pain . . .": though he has spoken thusly of problems (not myster- ies), he does proffer in his concluding chapter something that seems to ap- proximate a solution for him. "It is time to join the underground." With that he leaves his reader and all those printed sheets (ruined quires?) de- voted to vivisecting Catholicism. "It is time to join the underground" - not a bad clarion (and, true to program, it would certainly fit on a bumper sticker). But as a serious proposal for tomorrow, not yesterday, it seems at once too vacuous and too inflated. Notwithstanding its breeziness, it has been the subject of labored and lengthy scrutiny by more than one reviewer- reminding at least this reader of the problem in Chaucer's tale of how to analyze and subdivide a fart: "How hadde this cherl ymaginatioun to shewe swich a probleme." In fact, what Mr. Wills' pithy valediction re- presents is merely another illustration of his own-and by this time rather tiring-neoprimitivism. It is the old Origenist ploy. The complexities are just too overwhelming; that whole tangled jungle lying between mystique and politique is just too impenetrable. Therefore? Therefore, ignore its very existence; castrate the intelligence, or at least dedicate the intelligence to arti- fice not history. If this is a solution, then one is compelled to conclude that truly, "we do not solve our problems."</page></plain_text>
