<plain_text><page sequence="1">HARRY MILGROM Assistant Director of Science New York City Schools Brooklyn, New York WITHIN number the of past projects few years, have a number of projects have been started to develop science pro- grams for elementary schools. These projects will undoubtedly make im- portant contributions to science in- struction in the elementary grades. However, the total impact of a A Guide To Science Handbook Preparation particular program will depend upon the extent to which teachers can put the program into practice in their own classrooms. To help teachers introduce and use new programs, handbooks have been found to be very effective. Here is a checklist that can serve as a guide to either the preparation or evaluation of teacher handbooks. 1. Are the basic objectives of the science program clearly defined? £] 2. Are the anticipated outcomes of the science pro- gram set forth in terms of specific understandings, attitudes, knowledge, and skills that children may be expected to acquire? Q 3. Have the science content areas to be explored in the handbook been designated? □ 4. Has a course of study outline been prepared to serve as a framework for the development of the selected science areas? □ 5. Does the outline indicate the scope of the material for each grade and the sequence to be fol lowed? □ 6. Is the material organized in the form of major problems, sub-problems, fundamental questions, experiments and investigations, and understand- ings? □ 7. Is the material designed to place teaching empha- sis on the purposes, the methods, the processes and the techniques of science, rather than on the mere facts of science? □ 8. Has an editorial policy been formulated to assure a good format and a concise, interesting writing style? □ 9. Has an editorial policy been formulated to guard against the use of dogmatic statements? □ 10. Has an editorial policy been formulated to avoid the temptation to arrive at generalizations on the basis of insufficient evidence? □ Are such words as every, all, never carefully checked to make sure that they can be justified in a statement? □ 11. Has an editorial policy been formulated to avoid the perpetuation of unverified anecdotes about scientists or their discoveries? Q 12. Has an editorial policy been formulated to guard against the inclusion of anthropomorphic state- ments which attribute human attitudes and feel- ings to plants, animals, or inorganic things? □ 13. Are the teachers introduced to the great variety of approaches and techniques that can be used in science instruction? □ 14. Are the problems and questions at each grade level of interest to and within the scope of the under- standing of the children at each level? □ 15. Do the questions serve to provoke thought and stimulate activity? □ 16. Are the questions of such a nature that children may be expected to obtain answers to them with some degree of success? □ 17. Do the questions, explorations, and experiments encourage the children to think things through on their own power? Q 18. In the development of activities, are the children trained to devise their own approaches and mate- rials, to be on the lookout for ramifications of the original problems, to strike out in new directions, and to come up with a variety of findings? □ 19. Are the activities presented in such a way as to leave the door open to unexpected discoveries? Q 20. For each activity, are the expected learnings set forth in clear, simple terms? Q 21. For each area, are enrichment activities suggested for children who may wish to explore the area in greater depth? □ Are leads to project work and further experimentation provided? □ 22. Are the illustrations clear, accurate, and to the point? □ Do they contribute to a better under- standing of the text? □ 23. Are the supplies needed for the activities safe to use and easy to obtain? □ 24. In each area, is adequate and accurate background material presented to enable the teachers to guide the work in the area with confidence and with some degree of comprehension? □ 25. Does the handbook contain up-to-date bibliogra- phies of reference books for teachers and science books for children? [1 26. Does the handbook contain lists of appropriate audio-visual aids? □ 27. Is reference made to community resources that might prove of value in the study of particular sci- ence areas? □ 28. Does the handbook contain a glossary of science terms? Q 29. Does the handbook have a table of contents and an index? □ 30. Are the supplies needed for the activities in the handbook summarized in a special listing? □ 31. Does the handbook feature an appendix of useful facts and measurements? □ APRIL 1966 11</page></plain_text>
