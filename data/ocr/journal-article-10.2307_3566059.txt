Fire in the Venezuelan Amazon 1: Fuel biomass and fire chemistry in the evergreen rainforest of Venezuela. - Oikos 53: 167-175. The biomass, structure and chemical properties of fuels were measured in seven rainforest communities in the Venezuelan Amazon. Total surface fuel biomass which consisted of the root mat, litter layer, and downed woody materials ranged from 13 t ha-1 in an open canopy, low stature upland forest type (Bana) to 253 t ha-~ in a floodplain forest type (Low Igapo). The majority of the fuel biomass was composed of the root mat and large (&gt; 7.6 cm diam.) woody debris. Chemical contents of vegetation may play an important role in fire behavior. Energy contents of fuels will affect fire severity while compounds in the ash content may act as flame retardants. The energy content, total ash and acid insoluble ash fractions of litter layers and individual plant species varied greatly among communities. Energy content (gross heat of combustion) of the leaf litter layer ranged from - 19,000 to 25,000 kJ kg-~. Forest floor litter ash content varied from 0.8% to 7.7% and acid-insoluble ash varied from 0.4% to 6.2%. In addition to climatic characteristics that affect fuel moisture, it has been suggested that ecosystems with very long fire return intervals (e.g. tropical rainforests) are relatively inflammable because fuel biomass is low, fuel energy contents are low, and flame retardants are high. However, in the Venezuelan Amazon, values of fuel biomass and energy content were often greater and ash contents (flame retardant properties) were often lower than those reported for temperate ecosystems with frequent fire-return intervals.

Mueller-Dombois (1981) suggested that in con- trast to many temperate ecosystems, natural fires played no significant role in the development of tropical rain forests. He argued that as a result of rapid decom- position, significant accumulations of organic matter (fuels) did not occur in tropical rainforests. In addition, high humidities and frequent rainfall maintained mois- ture contents of organic materials above the threshold of possible combustion. Mutch (1970) found that fuel Accepted 3 February 1988 © OIKOS energy contents of litter were lower and flame retardant properties were higher in rain forests relative to those same properties in Pinus ponderosa forests in North America or Eucalyptus obliqua forests of Australia. This was hypothesized to aid in a decreased probability of fire in tropical rainforests. Recent studies reporting the amounts and ages of charcoal in rain forest soils of the Upper Rio Negro suggest that fire, although not common, has occurred in some rainforest areas (Sanford et al. 1985, Saldarriaga and West 1986). Radiocarbon dating of soil charcoal samples indicated that numerous fires have occurred in. the past 6,000 yr in the Upper Rio Negro.

Vegetation types near San Carlos de Rio Negro vary with pedologic conditions and elevation above mean river height. Igapo forest occurs in seasonally flooded areas, Caatinga and Bana on Spodosols, Species-dominant Tierra Firme on Ultisols, and Species-rich Tierra Firme, Second growth, and Treefall Gaps on Oxisols. Increased human activities in the form of timber har- vesting, road building, slash-and-burn agriculture, and pasture conversion for livestock have resulted in an increase in the frequency of fire in tropical rain forests. For example, Uhl and Buschbacher (1985) reported that timber exploitation in the eastern Amazon caused ex- tensive canopy openings and additions of slash to the forest floor which allowed for frequent occurrences of wildfire. Similarly, selective logging combined with an unusually prolonged dry season led to the burning of 4.5 x 106 ha of rain forest in East Kalimantan and North Borneo in 1982 and 1983 (Malingreau et al. 1985). Little information exists on the biomass, composition or chemistry of fuels in disturbed and undisturbed trop- ical rain forests of the Amazon Basin. To gain an under- standing of the current and future probability of fires in the Amazon, we conducted a two-part study in the Amazon rainforest of southern Venezuela. The objec- tive of the first part of our study (reported herein) was to quantify the biomass, structure and chemical proper- ties of downed fuels (root mat, litter layer, woody de- bris) in five undisturbed and two disturbed Amazon forest communities. Study area The study area was in the Amazon Territory of Vene- zuela near the confluence of the Casiquiare River and the Rio Negro (1°56'N, 67°03'W). The climate of the region is equatorial with a mean annual temperature of 26°C. Mean annual precipitation is 3500 mm and an average of more than 200 mm falls in all months of the year (Heuveldop 1980). Precipitation is lowest from October to March, though rainless periods longer than 10 d are very rare (Uhl et al. 1988). Typically, slash and burn activities occur during the months of November to February. Slash fires will rarely spread more than a few meters into undisturbed forests. Evidence of recent fires in undisturbed forests is extremely rare. We studied fuel characteristics in each of the main forest complexes at San Carlos de Rio Negro. Three tall closed-canopy forest communities were sampled: Caat- inga, Species-dominant Tierra Firme, and Species-rich Tierra Firme. Two low canopy forest types were sam- pled: Low Igapo and Bana. Two disturbed communities were sampled: Treefall Gaps in Species-dominant Tierra Firme forest and Second-growth forest from abandoned slash-and-burn plots (overstory age 8-10 yr) (Fig. 1). The major forest complexes consitute an intricate mosaic around San Carlos de Rio Negro; however, it is possible to differentiate each complex on the basis of geomorphological position, soil characteristics, and flo- ristic composition (Herrera 1977, Cuevas and Medina 1986) (Fig. 1). Low Igapo are floodplain forests which occur on land lying below the mean river level. Here, trees form dense, low growing stands (5-10 m tall) on hydromorphic gley soils. Caatinga and Bana occur on Spodosols. Caatinga, a closed canopy forest 20-30 m tall, occurs where the sand is fine grained and the water table remains close (within 100 cm) to the soil surface throughout the year. Bana, a low open canopy forest (5-10 m tall) occurs on coarse sands that are somewhat more elevated, and better drained than Caatinga. Tierra Firme forests occur on lands elevated well above the water table. Species-dominant Tierra Firme forests have closed canopies (approximately 30 m tall) and occur on Ultisols. This community is typically dom- inated by Eperua purpurea Bentham (Caesalpinaceae). Species-rich Tierra Firme forests have closed canopies at 20-30 m in height and occur on Oxisols. Dominance patterns are less predictable in this forest type than in the Species-dominant Tierra Firme.

Detailed descriptions of the composition, structure and successional relationships of the forest complexes can be found in Herrera (1977), Klinge and Medina (1979), Uhl and Murphy (1981) and Uhl and Jordan (1984). Methods Three sites were established for study in each of the seven vegetation types. At each site, three plots (3 x 15 m) were established for a total of nine in each forest type. All sampling of fuels occurred within these plots. Fuel biomass and structure Downed woody materials are the dead twigs, branches, stems and boles of trees and shrubs that have fallen and lie above the organic horizons (Brown 1974). This fuel component was sampled by the planar intersect method (Van Wagner 1968, Brown 1971). Because moisture content is a major variable affecting combustion, fuels are often partitioned into classes based on rates of mois- ture loss or dry down (e.g. a timelag constant). Water loss from organic materials tends to follow a logarithmic rate for which the time required to reach an equilibrium moisture content can be divided into periods (Pyne 1984). The timelag constant of any given fuel particle is the time for it to lose 63% of the difference between its initial moisture content and a new equilibrium moisture content under standard laboratory conditions of 27°C and 20% relative humidity (Byram 1963). The standard moisture timelag classes used to partition downed woody debris based on diameter are: 1-h (0-0.64 cm), 10-h (0.65-2.54 cm), 100-h (2.55-7.6 cm), 1000-h sound and 1000-h rotten timelag classes (&gt; 7.6 cm diam.) (Deeming et al. 1977). We established two 15-m fuel transects in each plot to measure fuel loads. One thousand-hour timelag fuels were tallied along the entire transect lengths; 100-h timelag fuels were tallied along the central 5 m of these transects; and both 1 and 10-h timelag fuels were rec- orded along central 3 m of the transects. The diameter of each 1000-h fuel particle that intersected the transect was measured to the nearest centimeter. For 1, 10 and 100-h fuel particles, we estimated mean diameter (based on measurement of 100-150 randomly selected fuel par- ticles for each size class in each vegetation type) and thereafter simply counted the number of particles that intersected the transect. Bias due to fuel particle tilt was corrected for as outlined by Van Wagner (1968) and Brown (1971). Because topography of all study sites was nearly level (&lt; 5% slope), there was no need to correct for bias due to slope. Twenty randomly collected samples of each fuel size class from each vegetation type were measured for spe- cific gravity (particle density). These values were used in the biomass estimation procedure for all woody mate- rials. In each vegetation type, 30 organic horizon cores of known depth and volume were collected, oven dried at 85°C for 48 h and weighed. These data were used to formulate regression equations to estimate biomass of the combustible layers of the organic horizons (root mat and litter layers combined) using depth as the independ- ent variable. We then measured the depth of the com- bustible portion of the organic horizon at each meter along each of the fuel transects for prediction of bio- mass using these regression equations. The biomass of the litter layer (Oi horizon) alone was also estimated using a 50 x 50 cm plot. Samples were collected immediately adjacent to each of the nine main study plots and next to a temporary weather station (i.e. 10 plots per vegetation type). All samples were dried for 48 h at 85°C and then weighed. Forest floor cover was estimated by the point-inter- cept method (Mueller-Dombois and Ellenburg 1974). At each 0.5 meter along the fuel transects, the surface cover was recorded as either litter, root mat, bare ground, rock, moss/lichen, wood debris or live vegeta- tion. Chemical measures that may influence flammability The chemical composition of plants and fuels are an important influence in fire behavior (Mutch 1970). Fire severity is related to the energy content (gross heat of combustion) of fuels. However, the availability of en- ergy for combustion can be inhibited by certain inorga- nic constituents (Broido and Nelson 1964, Broido 1966). These inorganic constituents are minerals found in the ash content of fuels (Broido and Nelson 1964) and specifically in the acid-insoluble ash (silica-free ash) content (Mutch 1970, Mutch and Philpot 1970). These inorganic compounds produce a catalytic effect that in- hibits the formation of combustible compounds during pyrolysis. Pyrolysis is the thermal degradation of mole- cules prior to combustion. The pyrolysis of plant materi- als produces the volatiles that support flaming combus- tion. Increasing the acid-insoluble ash content mini- mizes or decreases the net pyrolytic reaction leading to flaming combustion (Broido and Nelson 1964). Composite litter samples, as well as litter and green leaf samples from the dominant species in each vegeta- tion complex were analyzed for energy content, total ash and acid-insoluble ash. The composite litter samples were collected from the forest floor adjacent to each plot and a weather station (i.e. 10 samples per vegeta- tion type). Each sample consisted of 10 combined grab- collections taken along a transect parallel to the plot. Four samples of litter and green leaves from 11 common species were also collected. Each sample consisted of mature green leaves from 10 different individuals. Litter samples were collected from the forest floor beneath the plant where green leaves were collected.

Total ash was determined by complete combus- tion of a 5 g sample in a muffle furnace at 450°C for 8 h. Acid-insoluble ash was determined by boiling the total ash sample in 100 ml of 2N HCL and re-ashing in a muffle furnace (Van Keulen and Young 1977). The acid insoluble ash component is the amount that remains after boiling and re-ashing. Differences in all fuel parameters of the forest com- munities were tested by analysis of variance. If signifi- cant (P &lt; 0.05), the Least Significant Difference (LSD) test (Steel and Torrie 1980) was used to determine the statistical relationship between parameter means. Results Fuel biomass Specific gravity (particle density) of downed woody ma- terials ranged from 0.41-0.68 (Tab. 1). Specific gravity of fuels varied by size class as well as by vegetation type. The 1000-h sound class usually had the highest specific gravity of all fuel classes while the 1000-h rotten class was generally the lowest. Specific gravity was usually high for fuels of Species-dominant Tierra Firme while Caatinga fuels tended to have moderate to low particle densities. The biomass of the forest floor (litter and root mat) was most accurately predicted using linear and multipli- cative equations (Tab. 2). The coefficients of determina- tion in Tab. 2 suggest that there are other factors that account for variation in forest floor biomass in addition to depth of the organic horizons. For example, the density of the root mat in all vegetation types appeared to vary as a result of proximity to downed logs and tree bases. Typically, the root mat had a greater depth, but a relatively lower density immediately adjacent to tree bases. The total fuel biomass varied by greater than 20-fold among the seven vegetation types (Tab. 3). The Bana community had a significantly lower fuel biomass than all other communities (13 t ha-~). In contrast, the Low Igapo fuel biomass was significantly greater than all other communities (253 t ha-l). The organic horizons (litter and root mat) comprised &gt; 75% of the total fuel biomass in undisturbed commu- nities. Only a small fraction of this was litter (i.e. from 2% of the fuel load in the Treefall Gaps to 23% in Bana). Biomass of the litter layer was 8 t ha-~ in Low Igapo and ranged from 2-4 t ha-~ in the other six vege- tation types. In all vegetation complexes, the smaller size classes of woody debris (1 and 10-h fuels) composed only a minor proportion of the total fuel biomass (1- 10%) (Tab. 3). One thousand-h fuels did not occur on any transects in Bana because there are few trees in this community that produce a bole &gt; 7.6 cm in diameter. Disturbance significantly altered the biomass and ar- rangement of organic materials in Tierra Firme forests. In disturbed communities (Second-growth and Treefall Gaps), coarse woody debris were a much more impor- tant constituent of the fuel load. For example, the thin undeveloped root mat and litter layer in Second-growth stands only comprised 33% of the total fuel biomass, whereas 1000-h fuels comprised 65% of the total. In Tab. 2.

Forest floor cover All communities were characterized as having a contin- uous layer (&gt; 98% cover) of organic materials on the forest floor (Tab. 4). The dominant surface cover of the forest floor in all communities was the litter layer (&gt; 60%). Litter exceeded 80% cover in Low Igapo and Second-growth vegetation types. Moss was an impor- tant cover type only in the Bana community. The root mat without an overlying litter layer was 15-23% of the total cover in the closed forest communities. Basal cov- er of live understory vegetation in the Bana was 5% and &lt; 2% in all other vegetation types. Fuel chemistry Striking differences existed in the total ash (TA) and acid-insoluble ash (AIA) components of the litter layers among vegetation types (i.e. the whole community cate- gory in Tab. 5). The litter layer of Low Igapo contained significantly higher amounts of TA (7.7% ± 0.6) and AIA (6.2% ± 0.7) than all other vegetation types. Total ash values in the litter of Bana were also significantly higher than the other vegetation types (5.1% ± 0.5) (Tab. 5). The average TA content for litter in all other forests was 2.1% or less. Though the TA in Bana and Low Igapo was high, the makeup of this component was very different. The majority (+ 95%) of the ash in Bana litter was soluble in acid (i.e. silica). In contrast, the majority (± 81%) of the ash in Low Igapo litter was acid-insoluble (i.e. composed of compounds other than silica) (Tab. 5). As would be expected, green leaves and litter of dominant species in Bana (and, no doubt, in the Low Igapo) communities had comparatively high quantities of TA. The green leaves of a common large-leaved Araceae present in Bana had a TA content of 15.0% + 0.3. However, only 1% (0.15 ± 0.01) of this total ash consisted of acid-insoluble ash.

Appar- ently, the Araceae accumulates silica which is not a characteristic displayed by all members of the commu- nity. For all of the plant species sampled, the TA concen- tration was higher in the green leaves than in the litter. In contrast, the AIA concentration was equal or higher in the litter than in the green leaves. In addition to the highest values of TA, litter of Low Igapo and Bana vegetation types had the lowest values of gross heat of combustion (GHC) (Tab. 5). Litter of Caatinga forest had the highest GHC of all forest com- plexes (significantly greater than values of Low Igapo or Bana). The gross heat of combustion of individual spe- cies ranged from 18,933 to 25,128 kJ kg-1 for green leaves and from 19,028 to 25,643 kJ kg-~ for litter. There was no apparent similarity in values of GHC among species within the same forest complex, as var- iation in energy content of species within forests was as great as that between forest types. For example, in Second-growth, GHC of green leaves was 24% greater in an overstory dominant, Bellucia grossularioides, than that in a common understory plant (Salagenella sp.) (Tab. 5). Discussion Fuel biomass We used a combination of planar intercept and regres- sion techniques to estimate fuel loads. In North Amer- ica, the planar intercept has long been used to estimate fuel biomass, but we know of no other studies that have applied this technique in tropical rain forests. Non- destructive techniques are advantageous where destruc- tive sampling would preclude further on-site measure- ments. For example, this technique allows for repeated measures necessary to estimate the rate of fuel accumu- lation and decomposition, or for the estimation of fuels consumed by fire through before-after measurements (e.g. see Uhl et al. 1988). Comparisons of fuels in other fire regimes There are some interesting similarities and contrasts between the fuel loads of tropical rain forests and tem- perate forests of North America. First, organic horizons often constitute a major proportion, if not the majority of the total fuel load in both zones. A major difference is in the composition of these organic horizons. The lower organic horizons of temperate forests (Oa and Oe horizons) are primarily composed of decaying organic matter while those of tropical rain forests in the north- ern Amazon basin are primarily composed of live fine roots and decaying organic matter. OIKOS 53:2 (1988) 172</page><page sequence="7">It has been suggested that the moist, warm conditions typical of tropical rain forest communities, such as those at San Carlos, result in rapid decomposition of organic material. This in turn prevents the accumulation of heavy fuel loads and, therefore, decreases the probabil- ity of fire. However, fuel loads in the different vegeta- tion types at San Carlos ranged from 13 to 253 t ha-1. This great difference in dry matter biomass among these rain forest communities is as great as fuel load differ- ences reported for many North American temperate forest communities. Kauffman (1986) reported that the biomass of the fuel loads in mixed conifer forests in the northern Sierra Nevada (USA) ranged from 75 to 117 t ha-l. These fall within the range of fuel loads at San Carlos. In contrast, the fire regime of these North American forest communities has been characterized as that of frequent, low intensity surface fires with a mean fire return interval of 8-10 yr (Kilgore 1981). In the temperate rain forests of western Washington and Ore- gon (USA), Little et al. (1986) reported that biomass of organic horizons ranged from 46 to 244 t ha-'. Mean biomass of downed logs (&gt; 10 cm diameter) in old growth (Pseudotsuga menziesii) rain forests of this re- gion was 118 t ha-1 (Spies et al. 1988). The fire regime of this ecosystem has been characterized as variable, with frequent low intensity surface fires, and severe stand replacement fires occurring every 200-500 yr (Kil- gore 1981). Fire frequencies for tropical rain forests are largely unknown. Sanford et al. (1985) reported soil charcoal in Tierra Firme forests of San Carlos to be 250, 640 and 1560 yr in age (B.P.) at one site and 350, 1540 and 3080 yr at another. This suggests a fire return interval much longer than many temperate forests (i.e. fire return interval for Tierra Firme of 389-1540 yr). From these data, it appears that there are few relationships between organic biomass and fire regime, or that biomass of dead and downed organic materials is a limiting factor for sustained ignition and spread of fire in tropical rain forest communities. A major point of confusion is whether to include the live root mat as a component of the fuel load in tropical rain forests. Fuel biomass excluding the root mat ranged from 4.4 to 30.0 t ha-1 in undisturbed vegetation types. Therefore, biomass of dead and downed organic materi- als are lower in tropical rain forests than temperate forests of similar stature. However, complete combus- tion of the root mat has been observed in Low Igapo, Second-growth and slash-and-burn plots in Tierra Firme sites. In addition, its fire behavior during combustion and ecological role as a germ plasm source for species re-establishment is similar to the organic horizons of temperate forests, therefore the root mat warrants in- clusion as a fuel load component in tropical rain forests. Mean depth of the root mat in Species-dominant Tierra Firme and Low Igapo was not significantly differ- ent (20.8 and 21.5 cm, respectively) (Tab. 2). However, density of the root mat was 0.05 g cm-3 for Species- dominant Tierra Firme and 0.11 g cm-3 for Low Igapo. Even though density varies tremendously among micro- sites in the individual communities, the overall root mat density and biomass is much greater in Low Igapo. Because of the relatively high biomass estimation for Low Igapo, we were concerned about sampling errors associated with either the measurement of root mat depth or the relatively low correlation coefficients of the predictive equations. However, mean biomass from 30 eight-cm diameter cores of the root mat was estimated at 239 ± 13 t ha-~. This is very close to our predicted root mat biomass of 240 ± 28 t ha-~. In forest ecosystems, a relatively continuous fine fuel component is necessary for sustained ignition and fire spread. Forest floor cover of all communities at San Carlos was such that a fire event would not be limited by the lack of a continuous layer of fine surface fuels (lit- ter, root mat, 1-h fuels or ground-layer vegetation). Moreover, the biomass of the litter layer in our study (Tab. 3) falls within the range or exceeds the biomass reported for many temperate forests with a frequent fire-return interval. For example, Van Wagtendonk (1974) reported litter loads in four temperate coniferous forests that ranged from 2.9 to 4.2 t ha-'. Fuel chemistry It has been observed that increasing ash contents re- sulted in decreased rates of maximum volatilization, increased residues after combustion and active pyrolysis at lower temperatures (Philpot 1970). Philpot (1970) reported the greatest changes pyrolitic properties oc- curred in fuels having ash contents from 0.01% to ap- proximately 4.0%. In studies with plants collected from both tropical and temperate regions, TA has ranged from 0.1% to 27.1% and AIA has ranged from 0.1% to 25.3% (Philpot 1970, Mutch and Philpot 1970). In the composite litter samples of this study, TA ranged from 1.4% to 7.7% and AIA ranged from 0.14% to 6.2%. Total ash and AIA contents in green leaf samples ranged from 1.1% to 15.0% and from 0.04% to 0.88%, respectively. The extremely low AIA content (0.04%) of green leaves of Micrandra sprucei in Caatinga and Bellucia grassulariodes and Vismia sp. in the Second- growth stands barely exceed that of pure cellulose (0.01%). These are among the lowest AIA contents found in the literature. Mutch (1970) hypothesized that fire-dependent plant communities burn more readily than non-fire depend- ent communities because natural selection has favored development of characteristics that make them more flammable. This would include high GHC values and low values of TA and AIA. Obviously, none of the communities in our study are "fire dependent" as there is no dependence on fire-initiated reproduction for spe- cies persistence. The only forest community in the San Carlos region where evidence of recent wildfire was apparent was in Low Igapo forests and here, GHC OlKOS 53:2 (1988) 173</page><page sequence="8">values were lowest and TA and AIA values were highest of all vegetation types sampled. Low Igapo communities are submerged during 4-6 months of each year. It is possible that the high TA and AIA contents of Low Igapo were the result of deposi- tion of undetectable fine sediments when this commu- nity was submerged. Nevertheless, these high TA and AIA values do reflect the natural situation that could affect fire ignition and behavior. Mutch (1970) proposed that there should be an in- verse relationship between ash and energy content. However, we observed no such relationship. There are apparently other chemical constituents that affect GHC, most notably the crude fat content (Mutch 1970). Even though Araceae litter in Bana had a relatively high ash content, its energy content was the highest of all species sampled. This may have resulted from a high volatile oil or wax content evident on the leaves of this species. Four of the seven plant communities did burn when ignited during the dry season of 1986 (Uhl et al. 1988). These are the Second-growth, Treefall Gap, Low Igapo and Bana. Bana and Second-growth plots burned more readily than Treefall Gaps. The AIA content of the composite litter samples in Bana and Second-growth plots was 0.27% and 0.33%, respectively (Tab. 5). The AIA content of Treefall Gaps was 0.43%. Even though not significantly different, these values may account for some of the observed differences in fire behavior as pyrolytic reactions may be affected by changes in min- eral content of as low as 0.15% (Broido 1966). The GHC for litter in the rain forest communities ranged from 20,040 to 21,949 kJ kg-1 which is similar to ranges reported for the litter component in temperate coniferous communities in North America (20,472- 21,526 kJ kg-1) (Van Wagtendonk 1974). Mutch (1970) reported that the energy contents of litter from the frequent fire-return interval forests (Eucalyptus obliqua and Pinus ponderosa) were significantly greater than tropical litter. However, of the 11 species sampled in our study, four had a higher energy content than Eu- calyptus obliqua (23,422 kJ kg-~) and seven had an equivalent or higher energy content than Pinus ponder- osa (21,959 kJ kg-~). This suggests that there is no general relationship between fire frequency and energy contents of leaves and litter on a global scale. Though high contents of volatile oils and energy may have an evolutionary relationship to the flammability of fire- prone ecosystems of North America and Australia, these characteristics appear to be indeterminate or re- lated to other environmental processes in the Venezue- lan Amazon. Conclusion Fuel loads in seven tropical forests ranged from 13 t ha-~ in the low-stature, open canopied, Bana vegetation to 253 t ha-~ in low floodplain Igapo forests. In undis- turbed forests, the majority of the fuel loads are com- posed of the organic horizons (litter and root mat). Large downed woody debris (1000-h fuels) was the dominant fuel component in disturbed communities. Total energy content, total ash, and acid-insoluble ash are important chemical constituents of fine fuels which may effect combustion and fire behavior. Values of these constituents were variable among communities as well as among species within a single community. With the exception of areas subjected to regular clearing for slash and burn agriculture, fire return in- tervals are very long in the forest communities of San Carlos. Comparison of fuel loads and chemical proper- ties of this ecosystem and those with more frequent fire return intervals suggests that there is no global relation- ship with fuel loads, fuel chemistry and fire regime. Rather, other factors, primarily microclimatic effects, such as relative humidity, precipitation patterns, and consequently fuel moisture content may be the most limiting factors to sustained ignition and spread of fire. Human activities associated with deforestation will greatly increase fuel loads in tropical rainforest ecosys- tems. Woody debris was increased by almost four-fold in Treefall Gaps compared to Species-rich Tierra Firme. Along with increases in fuel loads, the canopy loss may result in drier environmental conditions allowing fuels to dry below a threshold of fire combustion. Under this scenario, the increased quantity of fuel biomass may result in severe fires which may significantly affect the subsequent successional patterns and species composi- tion. Additional microclimatic and fire ecology studies are needed to examine the causes and ecosystem level effects of fires of both natural and anthropomorphic origin.
