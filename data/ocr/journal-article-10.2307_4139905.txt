<plain_text><page sequence="1">God as Otherwise Than Being: Towards a Semantics of the Gift. By Calvin O. Schrag. Northwestern University Press, 2002. 157 pages. $27.95. The most recent book of Calvin Schrag, long one of the most eminent American philosophers in the continentalist tradition, is a significant contribution to the growing field of continental philosophy of religion. This exceptionally clear and well-argued book, which helpfully brings together a great deal of what is happening in recent continental religious theory, pursues a three-fold movement: beyond beings to Being, beyond Being to the Good, and finally, beyond the Good to the Gift. (1) Beyond beings to Being. Schrag first seeks a way beyond the God of metaphysi- cal theism (God as the highest being, as the cause of other beings) by recourse to Tillich, for whom God is not a being beyond or beside beings, and hence not a personal being at all, but being-itself, a move Tillich clearly made under the influence of Heidegger (15-16). The personal God of classical theism is an anthropomorphism who is impaled on age-old dilemmas of the problem of evil (see Spinoza). The other alternatives to classical theism-the atheisms of Nietzsche and Freud-are rejected by Schrag as reactive positions that do not explore what is happening in the idea of God in a sufficiently affirmative way. (2) Beyond Being to the Good. But for Schrag God is not just otherwise than beings (Tillich) but also otherwise than Being-itself, lying beyond, not only metaphysics and epistemology but also theism and atheism. The resources for this claim, the basic claim of the book, are found in three sites: a) the later Heidegger (Heidegger III), who moved past Being to that which gives Being, Ereignis, which is the first appearance of the "an-economics of the gift"; b) Jean-Luc Marion, for whom God is not Being but, in classical Neoplatonic style, a superlative hyperousios, more eminent than Being whom Being-itself never reaches; c) Levinas, who represents the most radical position of all, for while Heidegger's "gods" are creatures of the poets, and while Marion's God belongs to a classical Christian Neoplatonism, Levinas strikes out on the altered ground of ethics as otherwise than being and knowledge. Levinas describes the responsible subject faced with the neighbor who comes toward</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 277 us in the trace of God (a predominantly prophetic idea of God needs to be complemented by a priestly and sacramental sense of concrete embodiment). (3) Beyond the Good to the Gift. But even this ethical re-envisioning of God is insufficient, for taken to the end the relationship to the neighbor exacts an impossible and an-economic responsibility, what Schrag calls the "fitting response" demanded by the concrete situation, which is the gift of uncondi- tional love (agape/caritas) beyond ethical duty. Now the dialogue partner shifts from Levinas' to Derrida's analysis of the gift and especially to Kierkegaard. For the gift lies beyond the ethical as such, in the properly religious stage, by which Schrag means to resist the tendency of a certain version of post- modernism (Nietzsche, Foucault) to estheticism. The gift is not anything we "own" (or first possess in order then to give) but something over which we are stewards, which is paradigmatically true of our relationship to nature, which does not belong to us but rather we to it. God is thus to be thought within or perhaps even as the horizon of the gift. God's presence in the world is neither that of the realized eschatology (Hegel), nor the constant deferral of the arrival of the kingdom of God in Levinas and Derrida, but what Schrag calls a "preenacted eschatology," a partly realized eschatology, in which the kingdom has not fully come but begun to come. The transcen- dence of God is the transcendence of the gift, which is its unconditionality, which is nonetheless immanent to our quotidian economies. We acknow- ledge a gift not by a return gift (economy of remuneration) but rather-fol- lowing Stephen Webb-a continuation of the gift by giving to a third one farther down the chain, so that the recipient is transformed by the gift into a giver (without returning anything to the original donor). One acknowledges an unconditional gift by attesting to it. The ethical returns, not as nomos but as transfigured or transvalued by the gift; economies or rights and duties remain, but they are punctuated by gifts and ongoing giving, an "asymmet- rical reciprocity," not an exchange. We move about in the acknowledgment of a gift that precedes us. God gives the power of giving, the ongoing partici- pating in giving, enhancing the gift. Beyond philia, which is a reciprocal arrangement among equals, in which it would be irrational to befriend one's enemy, Schrag takes up Kierkegaard's exposition of the Christian concept of non-preferential agape/caritas extended to the "neighbor," rich or poor, friend or enemy, scrutinized by Kierkegaard in Works of Love (Harper, 1962). The kingdom of God is manifested in the workings of the gift as the works of love. Love is action. The gift is what comes to mind in the wake of our inquiry into the God without being. We began questioning about the meaning of God and have ended up thinking about the gift (142-143). This provocative and well-written book raises several interesting questions: (1) Is this to be understood as a "death of God" theology where God has died but lives on in the "gift"? Is God to be thought within the horizon or the semantics of the gift, or has God become the horizon or the semantics of the gift? Tillich is the father or grandfather of a certain amount of radical theology,</page><page sequence="3">278 Journal of the American Academy of Religion and philosophers of religion like T. J. J. Altizer, Mark Taylor, and Charles Winquist took their clue from Tillich's theology of culture to argue that the transcendent God of classical theism has died but lives on by having been transformed into culture, transferred to what Deleuze would call the plane of immanence. Taylor locates this living-on in Las Vegas and Times Square, in the neon lights of the casinos along the Strip and in the NASDAQ board-which is a completely virtual "stock exchange"-flashing on Time Square. That is the esthetic death of God. Now it is perhaps not widely noticed that Levinas is also a philosopher of the death of God. Levinas is no less convinced than Nietzsche of the death of the God behind the scenes, the death of the two worlds theory inherited from the Greeks and perpetuated in Christian Platonism. Levinas is no less proposing a displacement of religion in the classical sense not however by art and virtual reality (Taylor) but by ethics. The kingdom of God is to be realized not in the Magic Kingdom but by an ethical or moral kingdom of ends. The death of God for Levinas is jus- tified not as an esthetic phenomenon but as an ethical one. The trace that God leaves behind is invisible, not visible, not the invisibility of an electronic or virtual world but the moral invisibility of the face that commands. Is this the next step in the death of God theology, that God dies by living on- beyond esthetics and ethics-in the gift? That we do not give gifts to cele- brate the Incarnation but rather giving gifts is the Incarnation? (2) If so, how does this position differ from Irigaray's (and from her critique of Levinas), in which the transcendent God of Love has become an immanent divine milieu of love? Love is the medium in which we (should) live our lives. It is not a transcendent entity but immanent force which overcomes the subjectivity of autonomous agents and sweeps the lovers into each other's arms. In the divine milieu of love lovers are not to be conceived as monadic agents or subjects issuing intentional acts of love but as moments swept up in a powerful and immanent force. Is this the same account in which "God" has become the "divine" and the divine is love (love is divine)? Or how does it differ from Vattimo's transcription of God into love? (3) By the same token how does this account relate to the concrete confessional faiths? Is this the theory that philosophically demystifies concrete cultural- religious practices like prayer or church going? Or alternatively, if someone has nothing to do with the confessional faiths and does not "believe in God" but leads a life of "gifting," has one on this accounting entered into an authentic relationship with "God"? (4) Finally, is this transcription of the idea of God as the God of love into the semantics of the gift in the end too narrowly Christian? Does it apply to con- ceptions of God outside the biblical tradition? Is it possible to transcribe God in terms that are "otherwise than the gift"? Should that be the title of Schrag's next book? doi: 10. 1093/jaarel/lfi032 John D. Caputo Syracuse University</page></plain_text>
