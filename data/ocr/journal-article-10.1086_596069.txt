      <p>I want to begin this lecture by expressing my profound gratitude for the appointment as the Edward L. Ryerson Distinguished Service Professor of Theological Ethics.1 Renowned scholars have occupied the Edward L. Ryerson chair, ranging from its first holder, a physicist, to my immediate predecessor, Richard Saller, a distinguished historian. I am especially honored to be able to join this company of scholars. I am also bold enough to think that it is a tribute to this university that a theological ethicist is recognized in this way. The wide reach of inquiry at Chicago has always included the study of the religions and the many ways societies navigate moral and political challenges. The motto of this university is well chosen. <italic>Crescat scientia, vita excolatur</italic>: “Let knowledge grow from more to more and so be human life enriched.” This motto includes in principle the conviction that the growth of our knowledge about the religions will also, must also, lead to the increase of human life. Much of what I will have to say today about “humanizing religion” spins around these matters.</p>

         <title>Humanizing Religion?</title>
         <p>Events like this one grant a speaker a certain degree of latitude rarely found in the academy. In what follows, I want to touch on ideas and themes that have occupied me over the last years. This lecture continues my work to develop an ethics of responsibility for the integrity of life from a perspective that is at once humanistic and also deeply religious, in my case Christian.</p>
         <p>The title of the lecture trades on a double entendre that is meant to name a current worry about religion and the human future. How can religions be humanized so that they might help to forge a viable future rather than reduce the world to violence and ignorance, and, conversely, how, if at all, are the religions humanizing forces that invigorate the human spirit in global times when existence seems increasingly flattened and drained of depth? The idea of humanizing religion designates a double movement of thought that can be undertaken in different ways within diverse disciplines, traditions, and communities. However, it must be admitted that the idea of humanizing religion marks out contested ground in the academy and indeed throughout the world. Religion and humanism are often at odds and sometimes violently so. I take it for granted that each of us has some awareness of these ongoing global clashes. I will not explore them in detail.2 Yet theological ethics, I submit, must be reconceived in order to meet these and other global challenges. Accordingly, the interactions among humanism, religion, and the reconstruction of theological ethics are the specific topic of the reflections that follow.</p>
         <p>Importantly, the question of humanism and its relation to religion has deep resonance with the history of the University of Chicago and also denotes heated debates among the faculty of the Divinity School. Recall just a few of the voices. John Dewey, for instance, had his own kind of humanism, but Paul Tillich did too, what he called “ecstatic humanism.” In developing a philosophy of nature, Charles Hartshorne insisted on thinking “beyond humanism.” Henry Nelson Weiman, conversely, wrote about God as the “source of human good.” James Gustafson warned that while God is indeed the source of good, the deity is not the guarantor of human well‐being.3 The debate about religion and humanism continues today.</p>
         <p>However, if one wants to grasp what is revealed and concealed in debates about religion and humanism and also reconstruct a discipline, then the connections, if any, between religious and humanistic outlooks need to be articulated and analyzed. Paul Ricoeur, late of this faculty, helps us get at some of these connections in an early essay, “What Does Humanism Mean?” I am going to draw on this passage, although my argument leads in a different direction than Ricoeur’s. He wrote this: “Man is man when he knows that he is <italic>only</italic> man. The ancients called man a ‘mortal.' This ‘remembrance of death' indicated in the very <italic>name</italic> of man introduces the reference to a limit at the very heart of the affirmation of man himself. When faced with the pretense of absolute knowledge, humanism is therefore the indication of an ‘only': we are <italic>only</italic> men. No longer ‘human, all too human': this formula still shares in the intoxication of absolute knowledge; but ‘only human.'”4 This quote draws us into modern and classical thought about death, the will to power, creativity, <italic>Lebensphilosophie</italic>, the human attestation to being, and, most radically, the question of the good that human power ought to serve. Can sustained attention to that oft‐silenced remembrance of death limit the illusions of human power and knowledge and also signal the religious impulse? How might theological reflection articulate religious sources to invigorate the human spirit?</p>
         <p>The remembrance of death, I argue later, is indeed at the origins of our sense of responsibility, as Ricoeur intimates. Yet the remembrance of death fails to specify the good that we can and ought to respect and enhance in our relations and actions, a good revealed, I contend, in the love of life intertwined with death’s remembrance. The love of life, I also contend, finds symbolic expression in religious discourse. That is to say, while the remembrance of death—one’s own and that of others—seems at the origin of a sense that power ought to be given responsible form, it does not, I submit, tell us about the good that should be served and furthered. One ought not, as too many thinkers have, conflate reflection on “responsibility” and the “good.” Furthermore, Ricoeur’s point obscures the fact that the reality of and tensions among life and death are etched not only into our being but also, and importantly, within the social and natural environments, the structures of experienced reality, in which we dwell and for which people are increasingly responsible. The tensions between remembrance and love, death and life, give rise to different outlooks on the space of existence, both religious and humanistic. They can induce the quest to surmount finitude through the increase of knowledge and will, as Ricoeur noted, or to extinguish human craving. They can also be an impulse for convictions about the goodness of mortal being, which can limit the human power to control and order other forms of life.5 Mortality inscribed within a love of life thereby lays open as well how we can and ought to relate to realms of nonhuman life endangered in our age.6</p>
         <p>The tensions between love and remembrance within our being and found in the social and natural environments are given expression in religious texts and practices and thus connect the religious impulse with features of human life as well as social and natural environments. Theological ethics, on my understanding, must explore the dynamics and possibilities of lived reality in and through the resources of a specific tradition in ways pertinent to orienting responsible existence. In Christian thought, the area of my expertise, the tenacious ambiguity of our being and the reality of the world are articulated in symbols, narratives, and doctrines from different perspectives. Most profoundly, God can only be conceived without absurdity, as St. Augustine once put it, when one thinks “of Him as life itself.”7 The being of God is pure life graciously animating the whole of creation, yet a creation that is, nevertheless, constitutively finite. The reality of death and the desire for continued life can—and, tragically, do—fuel in human beings the celebration of power at war with finitude. When they do, they become from a Christian outlook a structure of experience, an environment within which we dwell, and it is symbolically depicted in scripture as the law of sin and death, a bondage to the machinery of violence and injustice under which creation groans even while human beings paradoxically mistake this slavery for real life. As Protestants thinkers have always insisted, redemption is liberation from illusion and servitude into the freedom of new life—new creation under the power of Christ’s spirit. These claims provoke the most radical level of reflection in this lecture. How can theological ethics working within the university make sense of those symbolic resources—or the resources of other religious traditions—for the sake of orienting responsible existence? Existentially speaking, the complex modalities of life captured in religious discourse—Christian or some other—disclose the deepest questions posed by pondering humanizing religion and thus are part of my inquiry.</p>
         <p>The tensions between remembrance and love that are etched into our mortality and our vitality and that structure social worlds are the hermeneutical key for the thoughts that follow. They enable us to ponder the double entendre of my title because these tensions link humanism and reflection on the religions. The following pages seek to unfold these tensions on the way to showing the importance responsibility and also the integrity of life have for current theological ethics. Yet at this juncture please note that we have also isolated a possible danger buried in our university’s motto. Is the quest for and pretense of ever‐increasing knowledge actually aimed at overcoming finite limits, the triumph of the will to power, under the dream of absolute knowledge? Is this motto, ironically, a slogan of bondage to illusion and futility? Can it be seen otherwise within a vision and hope of renewed life and responsible freedom? I shall take up those questions at the conclusion of this lecture since they open constructive reflection on the purpose of humanistic inquiry and religious studies.</p>
         <p>Admittedly, the argument that follows will be sketched in broad strokes, and future research and writing will be needed to fill out the details. In my defense, the purpose of an inaugural lecture is, after all, to announce a scholar’s agenda. I intend, then, to explore humanizing religions through several steps of reflection already intimated, which enact different but related strategies of thought: historical and social diagnosis, the critique of religion and humanism around key themes, systematic reconstruction of my discipline, and existential reflection that connects the steps of the argument. I hope you come to see that there is a crucial point in undertaking this kind of multidimensional thinking.8 Let me turn to the wild and confusing debate about religion and humanism in history and current social life.</p>

         <title>Religion, Humanism, and the Moral Space of Life</title>
         <p>The origin of humanism is often traced back to the second century CE in the West and the concern for good Latin usage. <italic>Humanitas</italic> is also sometimes linked to Greek ideas about <italic>paideia</italic>, or education, and training in the arts. Yet the idea of humanizing religion, as I have coined it, aims to reclaim insights of ancient thinkers, Hellenistic and biblical, that are lost if we just focus on the history of the idea of humanism.</p>
         <p>The connection between the formation of human life, as the core of any conception of humanism, and discourse about “God” reaches far back into Western thought. The renowned classicist Werner Jaeger, who once served on Chicago’s faculty, noted that the Greek idea of <italic>paideia</italic> found expression not only in sophistic and rhetorical terms, in Protagoras’s insistence that “man is the measure,” but also in Plato and Aristotle’s claim that “theology,” or rational reflection on the divine, is in fact first philosophy. God is the measure of things, the “unconditioned” as Plato put it.9 The grand enterprise of a rational theology was thereby meant to articulate the divine norm of human existence and the means, if any, of forming a way of life so measured. Strategies of formation are of course many, ranging from ascetic practices to the struggle for virtue and also devotion and obedience to the divine. Among classical thinkers, the labor of self‐formation did not set in opposition religious devotion and education. Stoics, Platonists, and Aristotelians as well as Christian and Jewish philosophers in different ways agreed that human life is only rightly formed, educated, through disciplines that link human beings to what exceeds finite being; life is a struggle of self‐overcoming toward what is most high, most real, most divine.10 As Aristotle put it in his <italic>Nicomachean Ethics</italic> (X.7.1077b31), “Man must not, as the poets tell us, strive for human things nor, because he is mortal, attend only to mortal things, but he should make himself divine as far as possible.” That idea returns in an inverted form in the nineteenth century with Friedrich Nietzsche’s proclamation of the <italic>Übermensch</italic>, the self‐overcoming of “man.”11</p>
         <p>The idea of humanizing religion, if we take the double entendre seriously, succinctly captures other historic strands of thought outside the ambit of Hellenistic thought. Rather than designating the apotheosis of human striving, here religion itself humanizes. The Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath, we have Jesus teach after healing a man. The Hebrew prophets demanded that the divine, too, is called to justice. There is, as Hans‐Dieter Betz has noted, something of an ancient humanism around the theme of the treatment of the enemy.12 Humanizing religion designates not only the agenda of Hellenistic first philosophy but also convictions about justice and care of the oppressed and thus the critique of and liberation from structures of bondage. These ideas arise mainly within strata of the biblical texts and so signal another side of our civilization’s legacy. Humanizing religion, historically speaking, denotes, then, different strands of thought and social life that have shaped Western discourse.13</p>
         <p>These ancient strategies of thought and evaluation about human striving for perfection and overcoming structures of bondage are buried in the cultural memory of the West. They now seem lost to us, although I am trying to reanimate them. Humanism is usually conceived in our social context in different terms. On a modern account, humanism means an outlook on life in which human flourishing is of central concern and in relation to which other ways of construing the world are interpreted and evaluated. Humans are the “center” of value, and diverse forms of life derive their meaning and purpose from human needs and capacities and not the human relation to the divine.14 What is more, the operative powers in the world, and so the makers of history, are human beings, no matter what other “powers” might be operative—divine or social. Modern humanism means, as Tzvetan Todorov puts it, that “man <italic>alone</italic> (and not only nature or God) decides his fate. In addition, it implies that the ultimate end of these acts is a human being, not suprahuman entities (God, goodness, justice) or infrahuman ones (pleasures, money, power).”15</p>
         <p>This kind of humanism, we can say, encodes a specific way of seeing and evaluating the world, a mentality or sensibility, and thereby forms part of the structure of lived reality within which people dwell. Its hallmark is the creative self‐formation of human beings.16 The best expression of this outlook, as often noted, is found in the Renaissance thinker Giovanni Pico della Mirandola. In his famous <italic>Oration on the Dignity of Man</italic>, Pico depicts the deity speaking to human beings: “The nature of all other creatures is defined and restricted within laws which We have laid down; you, by contrast, impeded by no such restriction, may, by your own free will, to whose custody We have assigned you, trace for yourself the lineaments of your own nature.”17 Humanistic <italic>paideia</italic> is nothing else, in this exalted form, than the formation of human “nature,” the core of which is the strangely wonderful and yet also vulnerable power of will. Human beings are subject to nothing beyond their kind, not even the divine, and the norm or measure of existence must arise within the will itself. Renaissance and modern humanism, in converse to much classical humanism, holds that the right orientation of human life is the creative exercise of power to shape one’s existence, rather than an ascent or unity with the “divine.” The modern vision of human existence thus linked an account of the good as finite flourishing with the drive to liberate human beings from ignorance and want.</p>
         <p>Within the emphasis on human agency and flourishing there is a deeper philosophical claim about human knowledge. Edward W. Said made the point extremely well: “The core of humanism is the secular notion that the historical world is made by men and women, and not by God, and that it can be understood rationally … [and] that we can really know only what we make or, to put it differently, we can only know things according to the way they were made.”18 The scope of human understanding is linked to what we have made, that is, the artifacts of human imagination, theory, and labor, and in the domains of history, science, culture, and language. This makes the productive sciences, or <italic>poiesis</italic> as Aristotle would call it, basic to human knowing in ways Aristotle and other ancients would not have understood. If Said’s claim is right, then all we can know are the products of human making, the reservoir and legacy of cultural products, and yet that “making,” while an affirmation of creative power, denotes a limit to knowledge rooted in human finitude.19</p>
         <p>From this perspective, humanizing religion could mean an inquiry into the penchant of the human imagination to make deities in human, all too human, form and yet to mistake the creative power behind those ideas. The ancient satirists rightly noted that if animals had gods, they would look like them. Deities usually look like their worshippers. Humanizing religion, accordingly, would engage religious symbols, myths, and practices—even in their most blatant anthropomorphic forms—as indirect expressions of the human quest for meaning and thus inscriptions of spirit. One of the most penetrating humanistic critics of religion in the modern age, Ludwig Feuerbach, in his <italic>Das Wesen des Christentums</italic>, explored this exact linguistic and psychological point, namely, that ideas about deities or heavenly realms are projections of the human essence and thus the alienation of human beings from themselves.20 Once this projection is identified, he reasoned, alienation might be overcome. The followers of Feuerbach are many, often unknowingly, and they rarely note the roots of their protest against human servitude and illusion in the biblical traditions.21 Still, there is a strategy of humanizing religion that is conjoined to the modern critique of religion. Human beings are not to strive for divinity, as Aristotle or Plato might claim, but, rather, the divine is to be decoded as an expression of human alienation. Or, as Luc Ferry argues, we have now moved to the belief that “man [is] made God.”22</p>
         <p>Here we find, I suggest, one of the roots of the current global debate about religion and humanism. At the level of structures of perception and frameworks of experience, the present tendency, unlike the ancients', is to draw the distinction between a humanistic outlook and a religious one in terms of the scope of human knowledge. Humanists explore the domain of human makings and so the realms of history, language, and culture in which we fashion and seek meaningful individual and social lives. Reality exceeds human makings, yet knowledge centers on our creative powers and finite limits (as Immanuel Kant first insisted). The humanist account of knowledge, thus, requires the denial of any other higher, sacred, or revealed meanings. The religions, conversely, are believed to present a different observation of the world that transgresses or exceeds human epistemic limits. Lived social reality on a global scale is being structured by a debate about the creation of meaning and the dynamics of human understanding. The debate comes to a head in disputes about posting the Ten Commandments at state houses or riots and deaths over political cartoons of religious figures and, more subtly, in theories about language and the scope of knowledge.23</p>
         <p>We have now isolated one of the structures of current lived reality—the moral space of much current life—rooted in debates about knowledge. If we shift from an account of humanism to the idea of religion, and so continue to probe the double entendre in the title of this lecture, other dynamics structuring contemporary life come to the fore. What do I mean?</p>
         <p>Debates about how to define, analyze, and assess “religion” are of course a permanent feature of the academic fields that constitute this school.24 On my understanding, a practice, symbol, story, community, or tradition is “religious” if it requires some belief, sense, or construal about what is unsurpassably important and real that invigorates life and enables people to meet, endure, relish, or surmount intractable features of existence. Whatever else religion involves, it is about life and death, creation and destruction, bondage and liberation, suffering and enlightenment, vulnerability and access to ancestors’ or deities' powers, or, conversely, the escape from the illusion of those beliefs and powers. The world’s religions conceive and orient human existence in radically different ways but always with respect to modalities of being and worth irreducible to finite existence or the products of human making. The point of religious existence is access and conformity to sacred realities, that is, the formation of a way of life shaped by nonhuman powers or agents.</p>
         <p>In this light, the idea that religion might be humanized is attacked by many proponents of the religions. Around the world religious leaders decry secular humanism, rant against the godlessness of modern science, and lament what they see as mounting moral decay. Within the academy there are thinkers, like Charles Taylor, who worry about “exclusive humanism” and its loss of a sense of transcendence and also about how this form of humanism is driven by a “rage for order” to transform and control every facet of life for human benefit. Mystery seems drained from human existence, Taylor complains.25 Some Christian theologians challenge humanistic claims in the name of a theocentric outlook meant to thwart anthropocentrism. Others want to draw a strict line between the Christian community, as a community of peace, and the “world” as a domain of violence.26 Those theologians cannot imagine that truth might be found outside the walls of the church. Conversely, the so‐called new atheists of Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennet, and company find laughable or lamentable the idea that religion obviously elevates, invigorates, and ennobles human dignity and destiny. It is doubtful for them that some truth might be encoded in the myths, symbols, and practices of the religions. Religious claims to authority, deference, and even obedience sound to these critics like nothing but crass authoritarianism and priestcraft.27 Feuerbach speaks anew, even if in less sophisticated form.</p>
         <p>Another dividing point between religion and humanism now becomes clearer. Typically, the religions, whether indigenous, primitive, or axial (to use some standard and blunt distinctions), conceive of reality as the interaction of agencies that can and do act on and in human existence and to which human beings can have access and ought to conform their lives. What is most important and real cannot be grasped within the framework of human actions but must be seen within a wider, if more chaotic, field of forces, often conceived as deities, spirits, or the one God. Religion implies the animation of self, community, and world from what is beyond the self or community or the world. The debate about religion and humanism is not then just over knowledge and perception, my first point, but also power and agency.</p>
         <p>We have now briefly probed the double entendre in the title of this lecture. Having done so, we are back to the nub of the normative problem. Is the purpose of the human powers of forming existence, our own and the environments in which we exist, a creative overcoming of mortal being in order to make man as divine as possible, as Aristotle argued? Maybe the purpose of life is to increase the will to power and overcome man into a new form of life, as Nietzsche thought. Conversely, we might agree with Todorov or Said that the aim of life is our responsibility for other human beings. Is one or all of those ideals inscribed in the motto of this university? Or is the purpose of human life, as the religions proclaim, conformity of self and community to some divine force, reality, power, or being that might invigorate but, we have to admit, possibly diminish human worth and finite life?</p>
         <p>Looking briefly at debates about religion and humanism and drawing on a range of classical and modern thinkers, I have tried to articulate and also analyze animating sensibilities of our age around the themes of knowledge, power, and value. These sensibilities motivate social life, religious and political conflict, academic dispute, and the deep anxiety among people around the world. What has my brief diagnosis actually uncovered?</p>

         <title>Knowledge, Power, Value</title>
         <p>The themes of knowledge, power, and value found in the global debate about religion and humanism shape current lived reality. That is to say, probing the debate about humanism and religion has enabled us to engage in a brief diagnosis of structures of lived reality and to isolate mentalities and sensibilities that motivate life within those structures. Let me briefly explore each of these themes (knowledge, power, value) and in doing so isolate the current critique of humanism and religion, which must be addressed in the reconstruction of theological ethics dedicated to humanizing religion. I am taking then a second critical step in these reflections that will be followed by thoughts on the shape and task of my discipline. Only in the final step of the lecture will diagnostic, critical, and systematic levels of reflection be brought together through attention to more existential concerns.</p>
         <p>First, consider the theme of knowledge. Humanists, like Said, link knowledge to the domain of human making and so the realm of history, language, and culture. Human action forms the “center” around which the rest of reality is observed, known, and valued. The religions, conversely, are taken to present a different observation of the world. What is real, ultimately, are sacred, holy, or divine powers that interact with and on human beings, and what is ultimately important is the right relation between human beings and these powers. Apparently humanism and religion encode different structures of perception through which knowable reality is organized, and those encodings are diverse responses to the tenacious ambiguity of mortal being. Part of the global conflict between humanism and religion is about which encoding of perception ought to orient social life.</p>
         <p>However, one has to ask a question. Given the condition of the global age, is either account of knowledge possible and pertinent? The German sociologist Niklas Luhmann notes, “Modern society is a polycentric, polycontextual system. It applies completely different codes, completely different ‘frames,' completely different principled distinctions according to whether it describes itself from the standpoint of religion or the standpoint of science, from the standpoint of law … from the standpoint of economics.”28 Even if one does not agree with Luhmann’s stark claim about systemic social differentiation, it is still the case that contemporary high‐modern, global societies are not ordered around one center, whether divine or human or even the self/other dyad. We cannot grasp reality from just one frame of reference; there is no center to knowledge.</p>
         <p>Some people find this situation terrifying and retreat into strident humanistic or fanatic religious outlooks centered on man or God. They hope to control the whirl of the age through the reduction of complexity to a single center or form of knowledge. Others see the polycontextual space of social life backing a free play of meaning and the destruction of inherited binary oppositions that are encrusted in traditional thought forms.29 Yet for some thinkers, myself included, our global, polycontextual condition invigorates a search for more complex and yet also coherent accounts of knowledge. Knowledge is multidimensional, I contend, and is constituted by the interaction among codes and frames rather than being organized through a “center” or a “hierarchy,” whether that center is the man of humanism, the god of religion, or the deconstruction of those binaries. Ironically, it seems that both contemporary religionists and strident humanists want to push back on the complexity of contemporary societies and champion simpler modes of thought and yet in doing so risk a reduction and not a gain in understanding.</p>
         <p>This critique of knowledge exposes the theme of power as well. There are a host of thinkers who decry both religious and humanistic outlooks as illusory, on the one hand, and, on the other, dangerously naive. The problem is not that religion and humanism offer different observations of reality but, rather, that they share too much, namely, a focus on “agents,” human or divine, who exercise power and shape reality for their ends. Thinkers as diverse as Luhmann, Martin Heidegger, and Michel Foucault, to name a few, see the obsession with agents who make reality as part of a metaphysical and “technological” outlook.30 The extension of power shapes human subjectivities, as Foucault put it, but also endangers the future or the very fate of Being, in Heidegger’s terms. If we are to understand the world in which we dwell, then the quaint idea, succinctly put by Todorov, that “man <italic>alone</italic>” makes his fate must be jettisoned root and branch and so too ideas about divine providence. The criticism is redoubled when we recognize that both humanism and the religions have blinded us to the moral status of endangered nonhuman life.31 How then are we to conceive, interpret, and understand the power(s) shaping our world?</p>
         <p>These points lead to a third one that has emerged from this inquiry: the theme of value. If the accounts of knowledge and power rooted in conceptions of human or divine agents are no longer plausible—that is, if humanistic and also religious outlooks seem incapable of grasping the structures of current lived reality—what is to serve as the measure or norm for evaluating individual and social existence in relation to the realm of mortal life? Where, we might say, does the good reside, and can it orient responsible existence? The search for the norm or measure of life hounds our age no less than ancient Greek philosophy, the biblical witness, modern humanists, or current critics of humanism and religion. Worldwide, people are asking about the forces structuring reality and whether ideas about goodness and justice have relevance and truth at all. Are we at the mercy of nonhuman and nondivine powers, the fate of Being, and therefore must endure our fate devoid of appraisal? Is there no room, no ground, for confidence that convictions about what is good have some purchase on the world in which we dwell, a confidence that can well up from the human love of life? I have tried to suggest that siding with either humanism or religion in order to respond to this situation is a false option because these outlooks do not address the challenges posed to their basic assumptions: first, the assumption that reality is structured by agents; second, an account of knowledge from the perspective of the favored agent (human or divine); and, third, that the good is defined either in terms of human flourishing or conformity to sacred powers. It is not surprising, then, that the humanities, religious studies, theology, and ethics seem at a loss for how to orient their work within the compass of the university. Their operative assumptions about knowledge and acting agents are widely rejected by various social and natural scientists and also by dominant strands of philosophy and cultural analysis.</p>
         <p>Can we reclaim religious and humanistic insights in the light of the critics through a reconstruction of forms of inquiry? That is the systematic question my discipline faces and the one to which I now turn.</p>

         <title>On Theological Ethics</title>
         <p>I obviously cannot set forth an entire theological ethics in one lecture. Besides, if I could do that, it would put an end to my writing books. I do not want that to happen! These limitations noted, what can be said? In sum, I seek to reclaim the task of humanizing religion as an enduring religious and cultural project buried deep within social and cultural legacies but now revised along lines intimated by the critiques of knowledge, power, and value. The work of reconstructing a discipline requires a hermeneutic of retrieval but also innovation. I judge too that it requires, at its most conceptual level, escaping forms of thought systematically dominated by the concept of a “center,” a human or divine agent or subjectivity and intersubjective relations or the deconstruction of those binaries still tied to that logic. And, further, it requires probing basic sensibilities of existence, the love of life and the remembrance of death, in order to articulate theologically the sense of responsibility and also the good that human action can and ought to serve. Let me explores these matters.</p>
         <p>While any discipline will no doubt have a dominant question it seeks to answer, this question, I contend, is embedded in a network of other questions that link and reflexively relate disciplines. Freedom to think beyond the logic of a center has profound ramifications for theological ethics since most of its forms have been dominated by that logic; they have been theocentric, Christocentric, logocentric, or ecclesiocentric in structure and purpose. Yet at the level of knowledge, we need to think of disciplines, and so theological ethics, as multidimensional in shape. As Mary Midgley has noted, “We exist, in fact, as interdependent parts of a complex network, not as isolated items that must be supported in a void. As for our knowledge, it too is a network involving all kinds of lateral links, a system in which the most varied kinds of connection may be relevant for helping us to meet various kinds of questions.”32 Attending to the debate about humanism and religion as encoded yet intractable perspectives on lived reality is important because it alerts us to the multidimensionality of knowledge and thus the demand to develop disciplines of thought that resist reduction to one form or one center. Any discipline so conceived must clarify lateral links within the network of knowledge and how it brings its resources to bear within the wider field of inquiry. Knowledge is a reflexive space of reasonable claims advanced and redeemed in response to basic questions. These links are important in order to establish the cogency, scope, and validity of a “discipline.”</p>
         <p>This multidimensional idea of knowledge bears its fruit in a reconstruction of theological ethics. In very different ways the religions provide guidance for human living, not simply with reference to a center but by answering a range of questions as well as the complex interactions among these questions. The questions demarcate a “space” or environment of human existence determined by the problem of how one ought to live, say, as a Protestant Christian or a Reformed American Jew, a Shiite Muslim or a Tibetan Buddhist. “Morality” is a name for the placement and right conduct of human existence, an outlook and way of life marked by sensibilities and orientations. “Ethics” is the critical, comparative, and constructive thinking about this moral space by answering the question, how should one live a good life? and the various subquestions that problem poses. The validity of an ethics is determined by the scope and intensity of its ability to intersect with other outlooks and disciplines and redeem the pertinence of its claims. An ethics that can intersect with and engage a wider scope of outlooks and positions will attain relatively greater validity than rival options for guiding human lives. That criterion is, actually, what dictated the shape of this lecture. It is why I probed the structure of current lived reality and engaged various thinkers around the question of the formation of responsible existence.</p>
         <p>This leads us to the question of the forces or agencies structuring lived reality. The moral space of contemporary life is increasingly a polycontextual field of forces, some human and some suprahuman, whether conceived religiously or not. That fact has been a reason for my work on the theme of responsibility. An ethics of responsibility, I contend, insists that human beings exist within patterns of interaction, with environments laden with values, to which they must respond and in which environments and agents reflexively shape each other. The capacity to have actions imputed or ascribed to an agent is with respect to the power to respond to environments—some of those environments are composed of other agents—that sustain but also limit action. Imputing and ascribing responsibility and so identifying agents are of course exceedingly complex processes, and I cannot explore them in this lecture. Still, responsibility is about the exercise of power in response to other powers, human and nonhuman, in which that is always and already laden with orienting goods, with values.33</p>
         <p>Now, the “world,” as I understand it, is a concept one uses for the complex ecology of reflexively interacting environments and the values historically etched into them. As human power grows through technological means, so too does our responsibility and also, interestingly, the world. In fact, our global age is a time of many worlds arising and reflexively interacting around the planet, and this challenges human beings to orient existence amid the possible collision and clash of diverse value orientations.34 The current attacks on human agency in the name of the fate of Being, like Heidegger's, or nonpersonal social forces, in different ways by Luhmann and Foucault, are wide of the mark. The increase of power expands rather than effaces agency and responsibility; it creates new worlds, for good or ill. We must, then, insist on the work of ethics within the academy since it provides a normative discourse of power and responsible agency linked to the articulation and analysis of the lived structure of reality as itself structured through the interactions among agents and surrounding historically shaped environments. On this point, the religions and the legacy of humanism were right to explore agents who fashion worlds.</p>
         <p>The reconstruction of theological ethics in the face of its critics requires, in terms of knowledge, replacing making with a multidimensional network of lateral connections. In terms of power, it replaces concern for unbridled forces with the relation between power and responsibility in world creation and orienting human life. What then about the most basic claim of value; that is, what ought to form the normative conviction of a theological and ethical vision? If we jettison here as well monocentric approaches, if we insist that we cannot define the good just around human flourishing or just around the divine, if we try to tread a path in and through but finally beyond anthropocentrism, theocentrism, or the current neohumanist focus on the finality of other human beings or even an ad hoc postmodernism, what do we have? This returns us, I think, to the elusive and tenacious ambiguity of human life that comes to expression in both religious and humanistic outlooks. It requires us to shift to a more existential level of reflection on responsibility and also the good we can and ought to serve.</p>
         <p>If anything characterizes our age it is the many endangerments to and alterations of life ranging from the genetic to the planetary. In this situation, some thinkers insist that we need a heuristics of fear about the possible end of nature and also to focus on human mortality in order to evoke a sense of responsibility.35 Jacques Derrida puts this forcefully in <italic>The Gift of Death</italic>. “My irreplaceability is therefore conferred, delivered, ‘given,' one can say, by death. It is the same gift, the same source, one could say the same goodness and the same law. It is from the site of death as the place of my irreplaceability, that is, of my singularity, that I feel called to responsibility. In this sense only a mortal can be responsible.”36 As Socrates is reported to have claimed, philosophy is about learning to die. Yet that is not quite right, I submit. While showing wherein the consciousness of responsibility might arise—that is, in the singularity of being toward death, my own or that of the other—the focus on mortality by Socrates, Derrida, Ricoeur, and others cannot clarify the purpose of responsibility, that is, the good human power is to serve. At best, it discloses that we ought not to do harm, a demand of nonmaleficence. Ethical reflection on how we ought to live too often dodges the question of why we ought to affirm life, our own, that of others, and also the wider compass of life on this planet. Here religious resources can and must be explored. That is, too often a theological or philosophical ethicist fails to grasp what Augustine profoundly understood, namely, that the remembrance of death is itself inscribed within life, and, therefore, one can bring this vitality to articulation in terms of the good that moral responsibility can and ought to respect and enhance.37 This opens and requires theological reflection into responsibility itself. How then are we to articulate the purpose of responsibility beyond the claims of a modern, humanistic orientation, man as the measure, but also beyond theocentrism? How can this purpose encapsulate the task of humanizing religion?</p>
         <p>Recall that the great insight of the Hellenistic and early Christian humanists, as Werner Jaeger recounted it, was to think through the opposition. As he noted, “Theology was intended from the very beginning to transcend humanism but at the same time it was the true fulfillment of the task which humanism had formulated.”38 A “theology” implied a <italic>paideia</italic> or a form of education that provided orientation to individuals and societies. Further, the biblical religions and the modern critics of religion advanced the insight that life, the flourishing of existence, and not death can and must orient human action. The task is to overcome the alienation of life from itself. More provocatively, I contend that the call of conscience to that task arises through the tensions among remembrance and love and is itself testimony to the life of our life, a vitality construed theologically as the “God” who communicates life and invigorates freedom and responsibility for new life. The remembrance of death is indeed at the origins of the sense of responsibility. I am bound to orient my power responsibly rooted in the vulnerability of mortal being—my own and that of others—to violence. Yet when one interrogates the complexity of religious symbols and practices along with the dynamics of mortal experience inscribed in the love of life, one can come to see, I submit, that the purpose of responsibility is to respect and enhance the integrity of life. Power ought to serve the integrity of life; responsibility is power so oriented and exercised.</p>
         <p>However, a revision is needed for our global times. It is not life qua life that is the norm, the good, for responsible existence. That conception would merely replace one centrism for another: biocentrism for anthropocentrism or theocentrism. It is, rather, the integration of many dimensions of life, the integrity of life, which must orient individuals and social action in our global times. This idea—the integrity of life—is a complex one. Within the work of theological ethics it enables critical reflection across an array of domains of existence and the goods proposed or entailed. It also provides orientation for responsible action. That is to say, the idea of the “integrity of life” articulates a multidimensional conception of the good but also a norm or measure for responsible actions and relations.39 Responsible existence is a life of integrity formed, personally and socially, through an enduring dedication to the integrity of life. The integrity of life provides the norms for humanizing religion in the full sense of the idea. It moves beyond a merely humanistic or theistic conceptuality or even the deconstruction of that dyad in order to articulate a good that resonates with religious and moral depths in the remembrance of death and the love of life. Keeping our attention on humanizing religion is thus meant to save us from a reduction in a conception of the moral good, to insist on the complexity of goodness. From diverse strands of our cultural legacy—Hellenistic, biblical, modern—there arise the resources to render productive, rather than destructive, the tension between the limit of death and the love of life, a sense of responsibility and the proper object of responsible action, the integrity of life.</p>
         <p>I have now sketched a reconstruction of theological ethics around a multidimensional account of moral knowledge, the place of responsible power in the moral and religious life, and, finally, the normative good of the integrity of life with its theological import. This conception requires rejection of monocentric forms of thought, humanist, theistic, or antihumanist, in favor of differentiated and pluralistic conceptions of knowledge, power, and value. The idea is to try to think as deeply and complexly as the structures of lived reality for the sake of orienting life responsibly. Much more could be said, of course. In fact, my present and future work is trying to provide a fuller account of theological ethics in the global age. Let me conclude with a few thoughts of a somewhat different order.</p>

               <p>The love of life in the face of morality is a crucial theme in modern and postmodern thought ranging from Nietzsche's insistence on “Yes‐say” through Albert Schweitzer’s “ethics of the reverence for life” and up to theologians as diverse as Karl Barth, who spoke of the Command of God as the “Permission to Live”; Paul Tillich, on the “courage to be”; Knud Løgstrup and his idea of the “sovereign expressions of life”; and most recently Jürgen Moltmann and his interest in the “spirit of life.” Sadly, it is not possible to explore these thinkers in this lecture. I have tried to address these thinkers, and others as well, in recent writings and will continue to engage them in future work around the theme of the integrity of life.</p>

         <title>Intellectual Labor</title>
         <p>We live in a time when it seems that many disciplines within the university are unsure of their task and purpose. Some scholars bemoan the listlessness of the humanities and religious studies. There are the relentless attacks, sometimes warranted and sometimes not, on things modern and Western. Of course, the question of what defines the university and its several disciplines is itself constitutive of the university and its disciplines. Yet the purpose of answering that question, and so clarifying the nature and connection of forms of knowledge, is not always transparent in our time, especially in the humanities and religious studies. Unconcerned with squabbles among humanists and scholars of religion, the natural sciences, like neuroscience and genetics, and the social sciences, especially economics, daily make inroads into domains of thought previously defined as the <italic>Geisteswissenschaften</italic>. In this context I have proposed a reconstruction of my own discipline in order to demonstrate its place within and contribution to the wider work and purposes of the university. This proposal might have implications for other fields of study. That is a question for thinkers in the various disciplines to debate. Yet beyond the matter of how we constitute and conceive of disciplines of inquiry, I have been driving at something else in this lecture.</p>
         <p>The remembrance of death and the love of life, which I have explored today, are in fact etched into the structures of our everyday, lived reality. Forty years ago this week, riots broke out at Columbia University and other institutions of higher learning and then, in May, throughout the United States and Europe over the war in Vietnam. Martin Luther King Jr. was shot. We are still at war but now on a global scale. And the killing of the just and innocent continues. Years ago some farsighted people grasped the massive danger we posed to our planet’s environment and forms of life, and we this week celebrate Earth Week in order to counter that danger. The past months have been scarred by an onslaught of murders in our city, especially against children. The remembrance of death surrounds us. Yet this week is also one of freedom and life. Jews around the world during Passover look back and reenact those events that led to their liberation from bondage. Christians look forward to Pentecost and the rush of new life in the spirit. Other religions also celebrate life in its many forms. People of good will around the world struggle against the onslaught of poverty, oppression, and dehumanization in the name of human dignity and also the fragile goodness of finite life.</p>
         <p>Other events, celebrations, and sorrows, religious and otherwise, could be mentioned. Again, all of these—and much, much more—form the structures and dynamics within which people dwell and that pose the basic question of how we can and ought to orient life. What then is the aim of intellectual labor? How can knowledge grow so that life might increase, especially in our age when so many forms of life and cultural forms are endangered? Is it possible to rejuvenate the humanities and to probe the religions in order to envision a new self‐overcoming of human power and knowledge into responsibility for the integrity of life within the complexity of the world? That is the work of humanizing religion.</p>
         <p>I conclude, then, that the task of theological ethics and, more broadly, the humanities and, if I can be bold, more broadly still the university itself is to examine carefully and critically and from multiple perspectives—including the religions—what it means to be and to live as responsible human beings within the vulnerabilities and complexities of forms of life. When we within our several disciplines respond to this task with all the vitality and resources at our disposal, then, I believe, knowledge will indeed grow from more to more, and life will be increased without the illusions of power or servitude to the tyranny of idols.</p>
