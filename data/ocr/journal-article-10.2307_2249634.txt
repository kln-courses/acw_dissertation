<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOL. XXXIV. No. II33.] [JANUARY, I925. A QUARTERLY REVIEW OF PSYCHOLOGY AND PHILOSOPHY I.-F. H. BRADLEY. By A. E. TAYLIOR. IN writing these pages at the request of the Editor of MIND I know well that I am undertaking, a task which I can only fulfil very imperfectly. My last opportunity of seeing and speaking with Bradley-the conventional "Mr." is best dis- carded in writing of a great philosopher and a great person- ality,-fell in September, 1923, almost exactly a year before his death, during the afternoons of three days which I was spending in Oxford on important business. He was then, apart froin an increasing deafness and another disability incident to advanced years, against both of which he bore up with great gallantry, to all appearance in good health and spirits, though unable to do much continuous mental work, and there seemed every reason to hope that we might have him among us for at any rate several years to come. Speaking of his own pl-ans for the future he remarked that when he grew "really old" he would, of course, have to give up solitary life in College, but added at once, "however, that question need not arise for some years yet". In the course of 1924 I received more than one letter from him, the last written only a few weeks before his sudden death from blood- poisoning. In all of them he wrote cheerfully of his health and his outlook to the future. He owned that he should probably have to renounce all intentions of further serious philosophical work, but, as he said, " I can be happy enough wwithout philosophy". Thus the news of his death came to me as a great shock from which I do not feel myself yet to have recovered. I do not know that at any time I should feel competent to attempt a purely "objective" estimate of the strength and the weaknesses of his philosophy or its 1</page><page sequence="2">2 A. E. TAYLOR: relation to the thought of eminent predecessors and contem- poraries; I am sure that I could not make the attempt now while the sense of personal irreparable loss is so strong upon me. What has to be said of Bradley's philosophy Ii must be content to leave to be said by others who perhaps stood personally rather further off from the man and can think of him primarily as the author of the three or four books on which philosophy among English-speaking students has fed full for a generation. My own object in the little I have to say is chiefly to record some of the personal impressions left behind by the thirty years during which I knew Bradley as the kindest and most unwearied of friends and advisers. I trust in this way I may perhaps do something to dissipate mis- conceptions which I have found current among those whose knowledge of him has been derived wholly from his writings. My own acquaintance with Bradley began in 1891 when, as a very young man, I entered on residence at Merton as a Bellow of the College. During the five years of that residence, from 1891 to 1896, I naturally had the opportunity of almost ,daily intercourse with him in Term time. This constant intercourse came to an end, except for occasional visits to Oxford, with my removal to Manchester in 1896, but from 1896 to 1924 we kept up an unbroken correspondence, at one time pretty frequent, of later years more interrupted by his advancing age and my own increasing occupations, but always kept sedulously "in being". I shall always deeply regret the misfortune that, owing to my having been obliged to transport myself and my belongings across the Atlantic and back again, the whole or all but the whole of the letters I received from Bradley before the end of 1908 have perished. They were numerous and often long and were largely taken up with discussion of important metaphysical and psycho- logical questions. My own experience, like that of others, was that Bradley was one of the most generous of. corre- spondents. He was always prepared to examine any question submitted to him with scrupulous care and untiring subtlety. It is much to be hoped that some of the recipients of these communications have been more fortunate, or more careful, than myself and have preserved them entire. A volume of Bradley's philosophical correspondence would be of the highest interest, not only as illustrating the doctrines of his, books and indicating his views on many topics on which the books are silent, but as placing him with Descartes and Leibniz in the very front rank of philosophical letter-writers. The ease and readiness with which Bradley expressed him- self on philosophical matters in private correspondence would</page><page sequence="3">F. H. BRADLEY. 3 mnake such a volume all the more valuable as an introduction to his thought that in his published works he has adopted a compressed and pregnant style which often leaves his precise meaning ambiguous. In many cases his letters, if they could be collected, would remove serious difficulties which beset the interpreter of his books. I shall never cease to blame myself for having preserved only the letters I have received from him since my return from Canada in 1908. It is natural, in view of his increasing years, that these should have been fewer and briefer and that they should be taken up more with matters of personal interest than with the discussion of philosophical problems. Among those who knew Bradley only by his books I have found a curious impression that he was by temperament a recluse, avoiding the society of his fellow-men, wrapped up in his solitary studies and devoid of any wide knowledge of life and affairs, in fact a philosopher of the type satirised in Heine's well-known lines., Nothing could be further from the fact. It is, of course, true that, owing to the serious physical trouble which beset him all through life (though in his later years he seemed, to me at any rate, to be less dis- abled by it than at an earlier time), Bradley had to be careful of his health, and in particular, to avoid exposure to draughts and chills, and'this naturally prevented him from going out much into Oxford " society". But he was neither naturally unsociable nor difficult of access. At the time of my own residence in Merton it was his habit, unless actually out of health, to dine daily in Hall or in Common Room, and there he was accessible enough to all the numerous guests who were constantly frequenting the College. As a conversation- alist I have never met his superior, I doubt if I have met his equal, for wit or variety of interests. He was not of those who bring their metaphysics with them to the dinner-table. He had an unusually wide knowledge not only of good literature but especially of social and historical memoirs, English and French, which made his table-talk as instructive as it was fascinating. It is true that, like most serious thinkers; he did not always " suffer fools gladly," and he had a reasonable objection"to having his dinner hour spoiled, or what was worse, his working hours interrupted, by humour- less earnest-minded persons who worried him unseasonably with questions intended to "draw him out" on philosophical topics, or merely inquisitive strangers who came to " lionise " him. With bores of this kind his method was to adopt a, tone of courteous and high-bred ironical deference which left them baffled, while it provided infinite entertainment to</page><page sequence="4">4 A. E. TAYLOR: the judicious spectator. I have been told by those who knew him in his earlier manhood that in those days he would sometimes carry this urbane answering of a fool according to his folly gravely through a whole evening in a way which reproduced the most finished achievments of Plato's Socrates, but by my own time he had come to temper justice to this kind of offender with a great deal of mercy; the elenchus was more rarely displayed and after one or two searching questions he would lead the conversation round to a different topic. The brilliancy, however, was still there; the scintilla- tions of wit which leak out from time to time in his books and have become famous are no more than samples of the manner of his daily conversation. No man could have been a better illustration of the falsity of the conception of a metaphysician as a being who passes his time in day-dreaming about unreal abstractions and knows nothing of the actual world of life and men. For many years Bradley took a very active part in the business of managing the affairs of his College and his judgment was exceptionally valued for its practical shrewdness by his official colleagues. I have often heard the remark that he furnished a living argument against the wisdom of the abolition of the old " life Fellow- ships," since he was the only Fellow of the College who was at once of sufficient standing to have a good knowledge of all its business affairs and at the same time, as he held no official position, able to bring a sound independent judgment to bear on the policy of the actual officials, Wardens, Bursars and others. Without him, it used to be said, the College meeting would be composed exclusively of the acting officials on one side and on the other of temporary " seven years Fellows," not connected with the College long enough to have an adequate knowledge of its -business and too young to exercise a sound critical judgment. The value attached by the administrative officials of a College with large estates and a great deal of financial business to Bradley's judgment in all these practical matters is high testimony to his competence as a " man of the world" in the honorific sense of the phrase. I cannot refrain from mentioning another striking illustra- tion of the same point. In view of Bradley's freqtient avowals in his writings of incompetence to deal with questions with a mathematical bearing it may be interesting to record a remark once made to me by a distinguished living mathe- matician; "Bradley is not a mathematician because he was never taught mathematics, but I am sure that if he had been taught, he would have been a good mathematician.- When a matheiaatical question can be put in terms he understands,</page><page sequence="5">F. H. BRADLEY. 5 he always has a, judicious answer for it."' (This was said 4 propos of a discussion of a moot point iin the logical founda- tions of the Probability Calculus.) That Bradley was a great gentleman and a brilliant conversationalist was, of course, manifest to any one who had ever passed an hour in his company; that he was eminently a man excellent in counsel was equally known to all who had occasion to transact practical business with him. His colleagues at Merton were perhaps even more imnpressed by his rigid and unremitting adherence to the high standard of duty he had set up for himself. It was a matter of general regret that he took the obligation of serving the College by his counsel so seriously that he would repeatedly endanger his delicate health by travelling up from the more sheltered regions to which he was repeatedly driven, to attend, in the most rigorous of weather, College meetings of no- special importance, even when he had been warmly entreated to spare himself the exposure. Not infrequently the result would be immediate confinement to his own rooms or even to his bed. None of us doubted that the price had to be, paid in considerable physical suffering, and some danger, for this fidelity to a standard of obligation which every one but himself judged excessively austere; but he could never be got, though the inclemency of our Oxford winter and early spring regularly drove him to seek refuge in the South of England or the South of France, to take what others regarded as only reasonable care of his own health at the expense of sitting a little more lightly to duties which most of us would have been ready to disregard when they demanded a small sacrifice of our own convenience. There have been critics of B3radley's ethical theories who have shown an inclination to 'regard them as rather lax; I doubt if the complaint would ever have been made by any one who was a witness of his practice. Perhaps I may be allowed to take this opportunity of saying that there can have been few philosophers who have less deserved the reflections which are constantly made by writers of the Pragmatist type against the so-called cold- blooded "intellectualism " of the Idealist. Though the retired life he was constrained to live may have done some- thing to conceal the fact, Bradley was emphatically a man of warm and deep personal feeling, rather perhaps too much than too little of the GefAhlsmensch. This is true of his attitude in other than strictly philosophical matters. The -warmth of his feelings indeed made some topics occasionally more than a little difficult to discuss. My own residence in</page><page sequence="6">6 A. E. TAYLOR; Merton fell just at the height of the Home Rule controversy, on which, naturally enough, there was a nmarked difference of opinion in our society; Bradley was by conviction a strong Unionist and had, as was usual with him, strong and weighty considerations to urge on that side of the question. But it was impossible to discuss the subject with him at any length without discovering that behind all arguments. of policy there lay in his mind a rooted distrust of the late Mr. Gladstone which amounted to a burning passion. The source of this personal hostility was no secret; it arose from ineffaceable emotions awakened years before by the failure of the Liberal Government to support and rescue Gordon in the Soudan. For fear of being misunderstood I should shrink from repeating in the hearing of any person without a keen sense of humour some of the things I remember Bradley to have said at the time about the overflowing villainies of the " Grand Old Man ". Perhaps it may be safe to chronicle one remark made at a rather later and calmer time when the news came that Tennyson was steadily sinking. "I wish it had been the other old man, but I believe the devil is too much afraid of him ever to come for him." Here at least the fun was as manifest as the fury. I must, of course, say something about Bradley in the rela- tion in which he was most interesting to me, as a personal influence on younger students of philosophy. When I look back on my own early days I do not know whether to be more impressed by his readiness to encourage the rather callow beginner or by his anxiety to insist on the importance of personal and independent thought. Young men coming, like myself, to the society of the College hot from the school of Literee Humcaniores, with a limited and one-sided stock of reading and:correspondingly one-sided and premature " views " must have appeared to him, as we really were, amazingly raw, But he was unwearying in the kindness and patience with which he would discuss our problems and try to save us from our own dogmatism and conceit. It would be a complete mistake to suppose that he ever showed any desire to indoc- trinate us with his own convictions or to found a "school," though he was always ready to state his convictions without reserve and to try to make us understand, his reasons for hold- ing them. My own experience, I presume, is in this respect typical of that of others. I had come out from the schools thoroughly imbued with the Hegelianism then fashionable at Oxford and anxious to throw myself for the time almost ex- clusively into the study of Hegel's text. / For all Bradley's admiration for Hegel and agreement with much of what</page><page sequence="7">F. H. BRADLEY. 7 seems to be his teaching, he by no means encouraged this bias without important reserves. Though he urged wide and careful study of Hegel's works and treated Hegel's deliver- ances in all departments of thought as deserving of the gravest attention, he would accompany every recommendation with the qualification, " but you must always remember that the man had a perfect itch for making out black to be white if he possibly could." It was characteristic of him that one of the earliest pieces of advice I had from him (and I have always been glad that I followed it), was to make a thorough study of Herbart as an excellent corrective of Hegelian bias. I have to thank him also for directing my attention to the importance of serious study of empirical psychology, a branch of knowledge at that time disliked and suspected by most of the Oxford philosophers. (I remember that one of the most brilliant of the group, quem verecunditae cacusa non nomino, once remarked to me that the less his pupils knew of psychology the better he should be pleased.) It was charac- teristic of Bradley that the psychologists he most admired were those who kept most resolutely close to empirical fact. Wundt, on that ground, he thought " not fit to hold a candle " to William James, and I fancy he always believed I was wasting my time in spending a year in the Leipzig labora- tory. For much the same reason he always insisted that Volkmann von Volkmar, in spite of his trappings of Herbartian metaphysics, was far and away the most instructive of all the German writers on psychology, a view which, if it is not an impertinence in me, I should like to endorse. Of German plilosophers as a body, unlike many of his Oxford contemporaries, he had no high opinion. I have heard him say humorously that he would like to force all German writers on philosophy to write in French under pain of death, because if they had to express themselves in a foreign language they would have to know before they began a sentence how they meant it to end. As it is, he maintained, a German Metaphysiker writes the opening words of a para- graph-long sentence without any clear notion of what is to follow and leaves it to chance whether the whole shall have an intelligible meaning or not. It may be of interest to record some of his obiter dicta about individual German thinkers. With Kant he had, as his published works show, comparatively little sympathy, though he regularly used to qualify his verdicts by the remark that he had never studied Kant profoundly and therefore too much weight should not be attached to his criticism. Fichte, he once told me, he thought quite the most difficult of the Germans to understand,</page><page sequence="8">8 A. E. TAYLOR: and had never been able to derive much profit from the attempt to study him. The same general attitude comes out in a remark he once made about T. H. Green to the effect that his work would have been of more permanent value if he had selected Hegel rather than Kant as the thinker whom he should either follow, or desert only when he was absolutely clear about his reason for disagreement. Next to Hegel and Herbart the German philosopher with whom he felt most sympathy was, so far as I could discover, that Gefiihlsmensch Schopenhauer, in spite of his total disagreement with Schopenhauer's unreasoned pessimism. But the desire of both Hegel and Schopenhauer for disciples repelled him. The "-faithful" of both persuasions struck him as simply ridiculous and he professed himself unable to understand why any philosopher should wish to have disciples at all. His own concern was not the propagation of any set of views 'but the stimulation of a few persons with the ability and opportunities for the task to take metaphysics seriously and to think over its problems for themselves.' In letters I received from him during the last few months of his life he more than once says of himself that he is fully content if his writings have been found by a few such persons really useful in the prosecution of their own thinking. In the same spirit, though he was as removed as a man can be from any desire for "public recognition " for its own sake, he expresses himself sincerely pleased at receiving the Order of M-erit as evidence that his work has been found really useful by the right kind of man. I have sometimes heard the complaint that by not republishing his famous Ethical Studies Bradley was showing himself neglectful of the needs of younger men who are thinking for themselves on the great issues of conduct and would be helped in their thought if the book were not so all but unprocurable. I think I should say, therefore, that I know he had serious intentions of republica- tion; he wrote of the matter to me as late as the date of the recent re-issue of his Logic, expressing himself as fully intending a new edition, if his life and health were prolonged sufficiently for him to do for the Studies what he had already done in the way of appended excursuses for the Logic. The Ethical Studies were left to the last, as I always understood, simply because they were his first publication of importance and he felt the tisual dissatisfaction of a writer of advanced years with his own juvenile work. The Ethical Studies would probably have been felt by their author to need more supplementation than the Logic, and he can hardly be blamed for attacking the more manageable task first, (though it must</page><page sequence="9">F. H. BRADLEY. 9 be remembered that he had been careful at least to explain that the book continued in its main features to represent his views on the questions with which it- deals.) Personally I should have been glad if he had undertaken what would have been the much less arduous work of collecting and republish- ing without alteration, in a convenient volume, the various essays in Psychology he had contributed to MIND, and I did all I could to plead for this, but I do not know whether any preparations had ever been made for such a volume. Perhaps Bradley set less store on these psychological essays than some of his readers; at any rate in his letters to myself he always contrived to put the question by. I have already expressed my intention of abstaining from any attempt at an estimate or criticism of Bradley's philo- sophy, but I must at least utter a protest against a misunder- standing of its temper which I have found current among some who, as I should have thought, might have known better. There seems to be an impression abroad that Bradley was personally hostile to religion in general or to the Chris- tian religion in particular and that this hostility colours his published work. As to the question of personal attitude I may perhaps be entitled to say something on the strength of a friendship of more than thirty years' standing. I am con- fident that no one who knew Bradley personally at any time would have supposed him to be anything but wvhat he actually was, an intensely religious man, in the sense of a man whose whole life and thought was permeated by a conviction of the reality of the unseen things and a supreme devotion to them. Long ago I heard a colleague, who shared none of Bradley's speculative interests and must have been speaking sinmply on the strength of impression produced by every-day association in social life, make a remark which goes to the root of the matter. " You might naturally expect that a man of Bradley's critical intellect would not believe in God, but it's so obvious that he does." Bradley, in fact, though the last man to "talk religion" in mixed company, when he did touch on it was wont to describe himself as a Christian, though not a particularly orthodox Christian. "My religion," he said to me in one of our latest conversations, "is Anglicanism; I haven't 'practised' for a good many years, but I would do so -to-morrow if I thought I should be the better man for it." In his later years, as Prof. Clement Webb has truly re- marked, he grew more emphatic in the conviction that our age is suffering more from want of a genuinely spiritual re- ligion than from any other disease of the soul, and did not disguise his desire to see a general revival of the religious</page><page sequence="10">10 A. E. TAYLOR: spirit. In the last conversation lI had with him the talk turned upon this subject. He spoke bitterly of the Christian ChLirch in our own country, chiefly on the charge of its alleged ' idolatry" of the text of the Bible, a fault not, I think, really common among Anglicans at the present. He com- mended the Roman Church for its discouragement of pro- miscuous Bible-reading, but held that it did not go far enough. He would have the Church, he said, cease to appeal to any literature from the past and insist directly upon its own inherent authority as the living voice of the divine Spirit. Possibly some of my readers who know Bradley only from his books may be surprised at a remark called from him by a passing reference in the same conversation to Purgatory. "But what ,do you mean by Purgatory? Does it mean that when I die I shall go somewhere where I shall be made better by discipline? If so, that is what I very much hope." In another mood, no doubt, he might have dwelt on the intel- lectual difficulties in the way of such a hope, but it was chAr-- acteristic, or at least I thought so, that he evidently clung to it. The explanation of what looks like animus against Chris- tianity in Bradley's books is, in fact, capable of a simple ex- planaition. In the first place, as ought to have been plain to any intelligent reader of the concluding essays in Ethical' Studies and of the chapter about religion in Appearance and Reality, Bradley's own personal religion was of a strongly marked mystical'type, in fact of the specific type common to the Christian mystics. Religion meant to him, as to Plotinus or to Newman, direct personal contact with the Supreme and Ineffable, unmediated through any forms of ceremonial prayer, or ritual, and, like all mystics in whom this passion for direct access to God is not moderated by the habit of organised communal worship, he was inclined to set little store on the historical and institutional element in the great religions. Thus while the conception of the meeting of the divine and the human in one " by unity of person " lay at the very heart of his philosophy, he was wholly indifferent to the question whether the ideal of the God-Man has or has not been actually realised in flesh and bloo'd in a definite histori- cal person. Like Hegel, he thought it the significant thing about Christianity that it had believed in the incarnation of God in a definite person, but also, like Hegel, he seemed to think it a matter of small importance that the person in whom the "hypostatic union" was believed to have been accom- plished should be Jesus the Nazarene rather than any other, and again whether or not the belief was strictly true to fact. The important thing, to his mind, was that the belief stimu-</page><page sequence="11">F. H. BRADLEY. 1I lates to the attempt to the achievement of " deiformity " in our own personality. This indifference to considerations; of historical fact is, to my own mind, an intellectual defect. An "historical" religion, no doubt, makes a greater initial demand on the faith of the believer than one which has no " historical " roots, but in compensation, where it is believed its efficacy in taking actual command of life is infinitely greater. The defect, however, if it is such, is one not peculiar to Bradley, but common to him with most of the best philo- sophical minds of his generation, and it might not be hard to point to actual Christian divines among us in whom it is as marked as it was with him. From the much more un- Christian tendency to mere " immanentism " with its attendant consequence of uncritical belief in endless secular " progress " as the good for man, he was notoriously wholly free, and rightly claimed that in this matter it was he and 'not the average popular preacher who was true -to the Christian tradition. Much of what is popularly called by reviewers the anti-Christian bias in his writings reveals itself, on ex- amination, as hostility not to historical Christianity but to the radically un-Christian humanitarianism of Tolstoy and other nineteenth-century writers. With the humanitarianism which shrinks from justice out of unwillingness to' make a scoundrel uncomfortable he had as little in common as Jesus Christ. I recall his once saying to me what I think in prin- ciple disposes of all charges of 'hostility to Christianity based on grounds of this kind. "Now-a-days if you speak of the wrath of God the clergy tell you you are no Christian; in my early days they said you were no Christian unless you were always talking of the wrath of God. And~ yet the wrath of God is a real thing, just as real as the love of God." I think also that there is a further complication to be taken into account by anyone who is trying to do justice to Bradley's attitude to the religious problems in which he took so real an interest. I have already remarked that- he seemed firmly convinced that the average Christian has an unintel- ligent and idolatrous worship of the letter of his Scriptures and that much practical mischief is wrought in social life by his tendency to convert biblical maxims uttered under very different social conditions from our own into a hard and fast code for- our personal conduct. This he held to be injurious to good citizenship, a point on which he spoke with warmth in the last conversation I had with him. I gathered, in fact, that he had written a very severe attack on " Christian ethics" from this point of view, but was inclined not to publish it as it was uncertain whether publication might not do more harm than good. I cannot account for what seemed</page><page sequence="12">12 A. E. TAYLOR: F. H. BRADLEY. to me his groundless belief in the actual dangers of " biblio- latry " except by the supposition that they may possibly have been real in the intensely narrow Evangelical circles in which he had been brought up as a boy. I suspect'that Bradley sometimes held Christianity responsible for the peculiar intellectual and moral deficiencies of the Simeon Trustees. In one respect it is only the truth to say that Bradley was much truer to the traditions of Christian theology than the theologians who have charged him with error. No scandal ought to have been caused to Christians by his repeated insistence on the intellectual difficulties which arise when you take the popular conception of a "personal God" for complete and definitive truth. In insisting that, while we cannot avoid thinking of the Supreme in terms of anthro- pomorphism, our anthropomorphic imaginings are all inade- quate Bradley was, in fact, strictly true to the orthodox tradition that all our knowledge, if you can call it knowledge, of the divine nature is "analogical ". At best we are trying, to see per speculum in asnigmate; our analogies, from human nature at its best are the best guides we can have, but they are analogies and nothing more, and they will always fail, us if we press them too closely. Like all the mystical souls, Bradley was always alive to the significance of the saying that "a God comprehended is no God". "The Absolute," when all is said, remained in his view a transcendent mystery; it never became, as it tends to become in the hands of some "Idealists," transparent. The cloud of "unknowiing" be- tween ourselves and It was always there, a position as orthodox in Christian theology as indispensable to any sane practice of the " mystical way ". Of course I am not pretending to suggest by these remarks that Bradley was, or would have wished to be thought, an orthodox theologian. My object 'is only to explain how he could reasonably speak of himself, when' all deductions have been made, as a Christian and to point out that he was at least technically much less unorthodox than most of those who attacked him on the score of his supposed heresies. For the rest, I would merely remark that, in all that has to do with the great religious issues, the volume of Essays on Truth and Reality seems to me to come nearer than any other of his writings to being an expression of the positlon he was accustomed to adopt in-personal intercourse during the last thirty years of his life. In all essentials, at least so I should say myself, that position is in the direct line of the great Augustinian tradition which has been 'the source of most that is best in English philosophy, no less than in English divinity.</page></plain_text>
