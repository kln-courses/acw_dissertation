<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ARABIC ELEMENTS IN THE JEWISH NEO-ARAMAIC TEXTS OF NERWA AND CAMADIYA, IRAQI KURDISTAN YONA SABAR UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, Los ANGELES 1. INTRODUCTION 1. 1. The Neo-Aramaic I manuscripts from which these Arabic elements were gleaned were mostly copied in the second half of the seventeenth century. The texts, however, indicate an earlier tradition of literary style, whose traces are well observed in the religious literature of the Kurdish Jews to the present day. The multilingual vicinity of the towns of Nerwa and 'AmadTya,2 with its cross-section of various ancient and new cultures, Hebrew-Aramaic, Kurdish, Persian, Turkish and, particularly, Arabic, had made a strong impact on this literary style. 1.2. The contents of the texts is mostly Midrashic (homiletic) commentaries on various portions of the Bible, based on traditional Rabbinical Hebrew- Aramaic sources, with many local embellishments, re-creations and interpolations. Although it is not very likely, the Neo-Aramaic texts may have been redacted directly from Judaeo-Arabic sources. The large number of literary and theological idioms and expressions in Arabic seems to support this view.3 However, no such sources have been found, and the numerous Arabic elements are merely loanwords nec- essary for the expression of a literary-religious style in the otherwise generally colloquial Neo-Aramaic. Lit- erary Arabic terminology is common in the Neo- Aramaic translations of the Bible, as well as in literary-religious texts in Kurdish, Persian, Turkish and other languages.4 1.3. In any case, Arabic was not unknown to the anonymous redactor(s) into Neo-Aramaic, who was probably from 'Amadlya.5 Its Jews spoke Neo- Aramaic, but knew Arabic as well, and had strong Rabbinical and commercial ties with the predomi- nantly Arabic center of Mosul. The Jews of Mosul, many of whom had their origin in Kurdistan proper, spoke mainly Arabic, but a sizeable number also spoke Neo-Aramaic and Turkish. In a manuscript dated 5476 (=1716 A.D.) (Columbia University X893 J7382), texts in Hebrew, Arabic (in Hebrew characters) and Neo-Aramaic are found side by side. The Neo-Aramaic dialects in the district of Mosul are more affected by Arabic borrowing than the Neo-Aramaic dialects of Persian and Turkish Kurdistan which, respectively, have more loanwords from Persian and Turkish. 1.4. The Arabic elements in these texts had been borrowed directly from Arabic or indirectly through other contact languages, such as Kurdish, Persian and Turkish, as occasionally suggested by their spelling or ' This is the name given by scholars to the Aramaic dialects spoken by Jews and Christians in Kurdistan ("Eastern NA") and a few villages in Syria ("Western NA"). For more details see "Neo-Aramaic" in Encyclopedia Judaica (1972), 12:948- 52. 2 Both situated in the Hakkariya region near the Turkish border. They were important centers for Jewish learning in Kurdistan during the sixteenth-seventeenth centuries. How- ever, in 1832 'AmadTya (pronounced 'Amldya by the local Jews) was besieged and almost destroyed by the Agha of Rawanduz. Nerwa, which was annexed to Turkey in 1925, had a similar fate when before the outbreak of World War I it was set on fire by a Barzani sheikh; see Sabar (1982), pp. xx-xxi. 3 See below, ?8.3. 4 See Yushmanov, p. 7; Leslau (1958), p. 146. In the NA speech of the Jews of Zakho (a nearby town) Arabic proverbs are common; see Sabar (1978), ?3. 5 Most of this literature probably came out of the school of Rabbi Samuel Barzdni (d. ca. 1630) who according to a local tradition was buried in 'AmadTya. However, his son-in-law, his daughter and his grandson all officiated as heads of the yeshiva (traditional school) in Mosul; see Sabar (1982), ch. XV. 201</page><page sequence="2">202 Journal of the American Oriental Society 104.1 (1984) acquired meaning.6 It is also obvious that the Arabic elements had been integrated in the Neo-Aramaic during various old and more recent periods, as some of the divergencies in spelling must be attributed to various layers of borrowing.7 Generally speaking, the linguistic features exhibited belong to the Arabic of the sedentary population of Northern Iraq, particu- larly of Mosul, as well as of Aleppo8 (Syria) and Anatolia, for example the qeltu ("I said")-type, rather than the gelet-type of lower Iraq.9 In the following sections aspects of orthography, phonology, morphol- ogy and lexicology will be discussed and, whenever appropriate, compared with Arabic elements in other Neo-Aramaic dialects, especially with the one spoken by the Jews of the town of Zakho, which is closely related to the Neo-Aramaic of these texts and of which I am a native speaker. 2. ORTHOGRAPHY 2.1. The texts, as customary in Jewish languages in general,9a are written in Hebrew letters. The Hebrew alphabet with some additional modifications is used to indicate consonants and vowels as well. The stock of consonants is indicated as follows: X = ' (glottal stop, hamza) 'I = d/d ( j ) and occasion- 3 = b/v ally d (a6 1 = g ;7 =h '1 =g ( ! )1 =w(/v) (Fj reC )/ j C )hz( T (French j) n =h (j = kix (C) X = z (Rand J:) o = m 1 = t/ == 0 S n =l t/ ) BY ': ( t,) Note that most of the Arabic consonants are indicated by the parallel Hebrew letters, adding diacritical points to indicate the particular Arabic (and other borrowed) consonants. Note also that the Hebrew letters n, Z, -I(D, n) indicate the plosive as well as the parallel fricative consonants, as is customary in unvocalized Hebrew, without any diacritical points. Similarly, double consonants are not indicated, e.g., ['zh] = Clzze "honor." Emphatic pronunciation other than the old emphatic consonants (Q, s, z, q) remains unmarked, e.g., ['lh] = 'allah (Z.) "God," [h'dr] = hidlr "present."'0 2.2. The vowels, as much as can be concluded from the spelling and comparison with the spoken NA dialects of the area," seem to be the following: Short: a, e, i, i (central, shewa), u, o Long: d, e, 7, a, 3. Most of the vowels are usually indicated by the vowel- letters ', h, w, y, and occasionally, in case of homo- graphs, Hebrew vowel points are added as well. The rules concerning the indication of vowels by the vowel-letters are as follows: (1) In final open syllables (with "short" or "long" vowels): e is indicated by -h or -yh, and occasionally by -y, e.g., [zhmh - zhmyh] = zahme; [bly blyh] = bale. i is indicated by -y, e.g., [qwy] = qawi a is indicated by -' and occasionally by -h, e.g., [czt'] = cizzlta. 6 See below, ?8.9. Note also that "words of Turkish and especially Persian origin are strikingly common in ... Mesopotamian [Arabic] dialects" (Blanc, p. 140). 7 See below, ?3.1.1. 8 E.g., the commonly used qawi in the sense of "very" is common in the dialect of Aleppo but not in the Iraqi dialects; see also below, end of ?8.9. Similarly, words with the consonant d- Ly is usually pronounced z, as is ; in the Iraqi dialects, except in the Christian dialect of Baghdad -seem to be of Syrian-Anatolian origin, e.g., haddr "present!"; see Blanc, p. 19; Noeldeke, pp. 397f.; below, ??3.2, 3.5. 9 See Blanc, pp. 3-11; Yushmanov, pp. 5f. Note, however, that the phonetic change r &gt; g, one of the most typical features of the dialect of Mosul (as well as the Jewish and Christian dialects of Baghdad) is absent in the Arabic elements of NT; see Blanc, pp. 22, 24. 9a See, for example, Judaeo-Arabic; Blau, pp. 46f. 10 See below, ?3.2; see Blanc, ??3.21(f), 3.23; Yushmanov, pp. 10f. In Z. the tafxlm tends to be phonemic, the contrast being mostly between native words and borrowed words, e.g., 'oda (&lt; OA 'abdd) "slave" but o da (Arabic-T.) "room"; see Sabar (1976), p. 81, n. 441. In specially dubious cases I consulted with Hakham 'Alwan Avidani, a native of 'AmddTya, and Khodeda Shalom, a native of Nerwa, as well as NA dictionaries, glossaries and grammars. It should be mentioned that the native informants were not always able to help as some words had become obsolete and were unknown to them altogether.</page><page sequence="3">SABAR: Arabic Elements in the Jewish Neo-Aramaic Texts 203 u/o are indicated by -w, e.g., [hrw] = hirru. (2) In all other syllables: (a) Long vowels (usually in accented syllables) are indicated as follows: d by '; i1/3 by w; T/e by y (very much like Arabic writing). (b) Short vowels: ulo are often (unlike Arabic) indicated by w, but a, i (i, e) are only occasionally indicated by, respectively, ', y, e.g., [hwkwm - hkm] = hukum; [qi - q't] = qat; [dpt'r] = daftar; ['bd'n] = Dabadan (influence of Arabic writing?) "never"; [Ddr - h'dyr] = hadlr. Diphthongs are often indicated by double y/ w. Note also that an initial cluster is often indicated by the prosthetic aleph, e.g., ['czym] = i'zlm "great." 2.3. In NA speech in general and, we assume, in these texts as well, the primary accent is usually placed on the penult syllable, including naturalized borrowed words. In the case of Arabic words with long vowel in final closed syllable, this may result in shortening the vowel,'la e.g., (Z.): za'if "weak," qur'an "Koran," miskin "submissive." The spelling rules men- tioned above apply to native as well as borrowed words, excluding Hebrew, in which case the borrowed words usually retain the original spelling. 3. PHONOLOGY: CONSONANTS 3.1. While some OA consonants underwent phone- tic changes, the parallel Arabic (and Hebrew) ones usually retained their original pronunciation, as follows: 3.1.1. OA C and g (spirant 1) became ' in native words, but Arabic ' and g ( t ) are usually retained,12 e.g., sa'dde "happiness," gdfilin "fools." However, occasionally Arabic ' is reduced to ', probably from an older stratum of borrowing, e.g., sane'ta (&lt; sina'at) "skill" (but s-n-' "to shape"), xile 'ta (&lt; xil 'at) "gift," n-f-' "to be useful" (but manfa'a, nafa' "benefit, use"), '-m-r (&lt; '-m-r) "to build." With some verbs the ' is retained (usually with some semantic distinction) in one conjugation but not in another,13 e.g., '-j-b IV "to wonder, be amazed" but '-]-b I "to want, to wish"; C-y-n I "(God) to help" but '-y-n IV "(man) to help." Occasionally, the opposite change may occur, e.g., casil (&lt; 'asl) "good origin, noble lineage."14 3.1.2. OA fricative f is usually reflected by p in NA, but to judge from the Z. pronunciation, is retained in Arabic (and Hebrew) loanwords, e.g., safare "travels," f-k-r "to reflect." In case of "inherited" Arabic loan- words from OS the reflex of f seems to be p (as in native words), e.g., qapla (&lt; qifila) "caravan," qaplya "member of caravan."'5 3.1.3. OA h is usually reflected as x in NA, but retained in Arabic (and Hebrew) loanwords, e.g., hai "condition," sahriye "desert." With some roots it is dubious whether they are Arabic or OA, e.g., s-r-x (&lt; OA s-r-h?) "to call out, to shout"; x-i-s (&lt; OA h-i- s?) "to redeem, to rescue."'6 3.2. The spelling, when possible,'7 indicates empha- tic pronunciation (tafxTm) of several originally simple consonants: s-i-h (&lt; s--h) "to arm," salThe "weapons"; S-i-t (&lt; s-i-t) "to rule"; h-s-r (&lt; h-s-r) "to sigh"; s-b-h - s-b-h "to praise"; ;-b-h - d-b-h (&lt; d-b-h) "to slaugh- ter"; z-n-t-r (&lt; z-n-t-r) "to insult"; mazmfit (&lt; mazmut) "solid." 3.2.1. The opposite change, i.e., original emphatic consonants being reduced to simple ones, is rarely attested: S'arte (&lt; Sart) "rules"; qista (commonly qista &lt; qissat) "story, case"; zarb (&lt; darb) "power, force." 3.3. The velar consonants g, x tend to interchange: x-d-m - &amp;-d-m (&lt; x-d-m) "to serve," &amp;-l-q - x-l-q (&lt; &amp;-l-q) "to close," &amp;-r-q - x-r-q (&lt; &amp;-r-q) "to drown," k-;-b - x-z-b (&lt; k-d-b) "to be enraged"; -f-r - x-f-r (&lt; -f-r) "to atone." 3.4. Based on Z., double consonants may become single:" haddda (&lt; hadddd) "iron-smith," xabiza Ila This may occur even in an Arabic dialect; see Blanc, ?3.34. However, whenever suggested by the spelling, we usually preserved the long vowels in our phonetic transcrip- tion, e.g., wazir [wzyr], but wasgyat [wsyyt], pi. of waslye "commandment" (pseudo-sound f. p1., for the original p1. is wasdyd); see other examples below, ?5.6. 12 In H. loanwords as well; see Sabar (1974), ??4, 6; Blanc, p. 20 (on retaining r in H. loanwords but not in native words in the Arabic dialect of the Jews of Baghdad). 3See below, ?7.7. 14 Cf. Z. 'asljya "of good quality," qur'an "koran," '-m-r II "to command, criticize" (&lt; '-m-r); '-n-k-r (but '-n-k-r in NT) "to refuse"; 'askar (but 'askar in NT) "army." Are these cases of hyper-correction? See Blanc, ?3.24(b); Yushmanov, p. 11 (qurqdn for qur'dn). 15 See below, ?8.8. 16 See below, ?8.7.1. 7 See above, end of ?2.1, and n. 10. 1 There are, however, cases of doubling even in the same morphological pattern, e.g., (Z.), hammdla "porter," tayydrci "pilot," xaddamta "maid." These may be more recent bor- rowings. On the other hand, there is occasionally doubling of an originally single consonant, e.g., saga (Z., but sC'a in</page><page sequence="4">204 Journal of the American Oriental Society 104.1 (1984) (&lt; xabbiz) "baker," 'abada (&lt; 'abbdd) "worshipper," qasdpa (&lt; qassdb) "butcher"; mahife (&lt; mihiffa) "canopies," kira (&lt; karra) "time," cl-ya (&lt; cullTya) "attic." Note that in a final position an originally double consonant is reduced to a single one, but doubled when a suffix is added, e.g., gam (&lt; gamm) "concern" but kammi "my concern." 3.5. Note also the following more or less isolated changes:'9 buxtin (&lt; buhtin) "false plot"; mahramTn - mahrmrnT "deprived people," h-j-m - h-j-m (&lt; hij- m) "to find rest (from pain)"; x-f-q h-f-q (&lt; x-f-q) "to stir (emotions)"; hirge (&lt; xirqa "rag"?) "(worn) clothes"; hus'ta (&lt; hujjat) "pretext"; qasdpa (&lt; qassdb) "butcher," s-b-h - s-p-h (&lt; s-b-h) "to resemble," k-b-s - k-p-s (&lt; k-b-s) "to conquer"; 'umbar (&lt; 'anbar) "storehouse," hanaq (&lt; hahnaq) "mockery"; xzlmzta (&lt; xidmat) "service"; daskara (&lt; tadkara) "writ"; nisbita - nzzbzta (&lt; n-s-b) "circumstance"; s-g-l - I (&lt; s-g-l) "to work"; c-n-t (&lt; c-n-d) "to resist," nahTd (&lt; nahlt) "hewn (stone)," halbad (&lt; al-batta) "certainly"; 'istatta (&lt; *'ustadta) "master's wife"; gazab - aadab "rage," hdzirfn "present audience," h- z-r "to appear" but hadir "right away";20 hawan (&lt; 'awdn) "due time," ray (&lt; ra'y) "advice," ddyim (&lt; d'im) "always," haya (&lt; hayd )21 "shame"; kiriyat (&lt; kardhat) "ugly"; '-y-n (&lt;c '-w-n) "to help," t-y-b-x (&lt; tawbTx) "to reproach"; f-y-r (&lt;f-r-r) "to fly.",22 3.6. Metathesis: fas'hitydta (&lt;fahisa-t) "(sexual) abominations"; kab'a (&lt; kacb) "knuckle"; qulfa (&lt; qufl; Z. qufla) "padlock"; !-m-c (&lt; t-c-m)23 "to overlay"; h-r-s' (&lt; h-s-r) "to crowd"; s-j-d - s-d-j (- s- jj- s-y-j &lt;s-j-d) "to bow in worship." 4. PHONOLOGY: VOWELS 4.1. Final a (a, ah) commonly changes to e (imala), 24 except when preceded by a guttural consonant, e.g., xidme "service," qahwe "coffee," zahme "annoyance," tobe "repentance," fatwe "religious opinion," waslye "bequest"; ma'ne "meaning," zine "adultery," bale "however," but: maslaha "affair," jamd'a "congrega- tion," qal'a "fortress,'" ta'a - t!'e (- d'lta) "obedi- ence." Exceptions:25 barTya "desert," barnlya "flask," badla "night watch," joqa "group," kdra (&lt; karra) "(recurrent) time," naba "night watch," najma "star, embellishment," nqjda "gang"; da'we "plea" (but Z. da'wa "[invitation to] a wedding.") Cf. also 'inni (&lt; 'inna) "that; because." 4.1.1. Medial a occasionally becomes e (T): jjrTye (&lt;jariya) "maid," feka (&lt;fdkiha) "fruit," hikim - hdkim "ruler," 'imin (&lt; 'amin) "secure" (but xilzs "pure, exempt," xiliq "Creator," qdtli "enemy," hddir "right away"), rammilTn- rammdlTn "soothsayers," darset - darsacat "on the hour, right then" (P.-K.); salThe (&lt; silah) "weapons." 4.2. Vowels a/i tend to become u(u?) (is'mdm):26 cudab (&lt;caadab) "suffering," juza (&lt;jaza ') "reward, punishment," ruza (&lt; rida) "will," sur (&lt; sirr) "secret," qasud (&lt; qasid) "messenger," subah (&lt; sabah) "morn- ing," hubra (&lt; hibr) "ink," fukur (&lt;fikr) "thought," fuhum (&lt;fahm) "understanding, "fu'la (&lt;fit ') "deed." 4.3. Adding an auxiliary vowel to separate final clusters:27 fuqir [pwqyr] (&lt;fuqr) "poverty," fukur [pwkwr] (&lt;fikr) "thought,"hukum [hwkwm] (&lt; hukm) "reign"; bahhar [11T] (&lt; bahr)28 "sea," caqll [cqyl] (&lt;caql) "mind." 4.4. Diphthongs aw, ay usually become, respectively, o, e: qom "people, nation," qol "agreement, condi- tion," sot "sound," xof "fear," maja "wave"; ciba "disgrace," hef "pity," hewdn "animal," hebita "awe." Exceptions: 'awwal "first"; hawja "need," mawtan NT) "hour," bahhar "sea" (see below, ?4.3); see also below, ?4.6: qista, etc. '9 Some of these occur in the intermediary languages, e.g., buxtan &lt; K, or in the Arabic dialects, such as daskara &lt; Iraqi Arabic (see Noeldeke, p. 398: taskara); see below, ?8.9; others are common in the native words, e.g., b - p, d - t, g-x. 20 See above, n. 8. 2 See below, ?4.5. See below, ??7.3-7.5. 23 So in the native verb t-m-' (OA tcem) "to taste." Is qalme "lice" from Arabic qaml? It seems more likely that qaml itself is a metathesis; cf. OA qalmj, Akkadian kalmatu, H. kinnTm. 24 For a detailed study of imdla in old and new Arabic dialects see Levin; cf. Yushmanov, p. 13; Blanc, ??3.36, 4.3. It is interesting to note that it never occurs in native Aramaic words, even in a case when both the Arabic and the NA forms coalesce; cf. the NA participle hdkim "he governs" but hikim (&lt; Arabic hakim) "governor"; see Noeldeke, pp. 391, 393. 25 Most may be explained by certain phonological condi- tioning (see Levin, pp. 31 ff.) or borrowing from dialects in which imdla does not occur; cf. qahwe, dacwe in NT but qahwa, dacwa in Z. 26 See Yushmanov, p. 13; Blanc, pp. 32, 35ff., 40. 27 See Blanc, ?3.52; Noeldeke, p. 392. 28 See Blanc, p. 55: bahar; see above, n. 18.</page><page sequence="5">SABAR: Arabic Elements in the Jewish Neo-Aramaic Texts 205 "homeland," mawlayi "my Lord," dawilta (&lt; dawlat) "wealth, government" but dolatmand (P.) "wealthy."29 4.5. Final a' usually becomes a 30 juza "punish- ment," haya "bashfulness," hawja "need," bala "trouble," xata "sin," but kire "rent, wages"; cf. also sahrdye (with the P.-K. izafe) "desert," 'azdye "mourning," and similarly ma'ndye (&lt; ma'nd) "mean- ing." 4.6. Varia: 'cqll - 'aqll3l (&lt; 'aql) "mind"; LabTt (&lt; Obht)32 "certainly," 'axTr (&lt; 'dxir?) "end," jdhilTn ] jahTlTn (?)

There seems to be velarization of the vowel i in the word ya cnix [y cnyk] - ya cni "namely."36 5. MORPHOLOGY: NOUNS 5.1. Many Arabic nouns in singular are suffixed with an Aramaic ending.37 The Arabic feminine ending -at, as in P.-K., is retained in such a case.38 (a) The OA definite article suffix -a (m.), -ta (f.): daxIa "crop's produce," qasra "palace," DamTra "emir," karba "agony "; awwalhta "beginning, "axTrita "end".39 dawilta "government," qista "story," Iaybita "(awe- some) hoariness." (b) The OA abstract noun suffix - uta: qyz-i ta "jurisdiction," gardbata "foreignness," wahrduta "singularity (of God)," waqhita "insolence," qasuduta "mission," 'inatata "coercion" (&lt; 'inad or iCndt?). (c) Adjectival ending -dna: xofiana "scary, awesome." (d) Other endings: xalhya (&lt; xdl) "maternal uncle"; xalunta (diminutive) "sister" ("little aunt"); rohdya "soul, spirit." 5.2. Occasionally a borrowed Arabic root is used with Aramaic noun patterns: hakoma "king," naqosa "missing, lacking"; zoddna "additional, more"; mtafsirina "interpreter, exegete"; jarrabita "(straining) trial."40 5.3. However, many nouns in the singular are bor- rowed with no modification or suffixing,4' e.g., tafsTr "commentary, translation," waqt "time," farq "differ- ence," Dihsdn "favor"; szlca (&lt; silcat) "merchandise," zamCa "consternation," nuqra "silver." 5.4. Some nouns interchange between both forms, with or without the Aramaic suffix: sanduiq - sanduiqa "chest, coffin," waz-r -~ wazTra "vizier," cizze -czzlta "honor," 'amdne _ Damdnita "trust," sarqi - farqdya "eastern (wind)"; a cTf(adj.): za cfa (n.) "weak," miskTn (adj.): miskTna (n.) "poor, submissive."42 5.5. Nouns in plural often take an Aramaic plural ending:43 qistyata "stories, happenings," hikdyityita "tales," casirityjta "tribes, "h.hjiyJt a "(necessary) tools"; wazTre "viziers, " DamTre "emirs," xatdhe "sins," 'aIjbe C cajlbwdta - cajIbydta "wonders." 5.6. Some nouns retain the Arabic plural form:44 gfillTn "fools," jahlThn "boors," rammdlln "geoman- cers," farlftn (instead of the regular broken plural, 'asraJJ CurafJ ) "eminent persons"; wasfyat45 "be- quests," rihdnTyat "divine creatures," xafa-ydt (instead of xafa-yd or xaftydt) "mysteries"; cuyuin "(spiritual) 29 See Blanc, ?3.37; Yushmanov, p. 13. 30 See Blanc, ?3.35; Levin, p. 48. 31In Z. only 'cqll (noun and adj.) "mind; intelligent, smart." 32 Spelled [tbyt], perhaps a defective spelling for [t'bt] Lblt. For the use of adjectives as adverbs see below, ?6.4. 33 But 'azim in Z. (the accent on the last syllable indicates unnaturalized, recent borrowing; see ?2.3 above.); see Blanc, ??3.32, 3.33; Yushmanov, p. 11 (on "bookish" words). 34 See Noeldeke, p. 393. 35 See above, ?3.4. 36 Velarized vowels (ix, ux) are common in some NA dialects; see Sabar (1976), p. 37, n. 6. 37 See Leslau (1956a), pp. 24f.; Leslau (1957), pp. 231f.; Leslau (1956b), p. 209; Sabar (1974), ?21; Sabar (1975a), pp. 283f.; Sabar (1975b), ?3.6. 38 See above, ?4.1 and below, ??5.3, 5.4, 8.9; see Noeldeke, p. 393; Leslau (1958), p. 157, and all loc. cit. in n. 37 above. 39 It seems that the Aramaic f. ending in these two cases is added directly to the base 'awwal and DaxTr (both used in NT), rather than being modified from Arabic Dawwalyat and DaxTrat. 40 Note that some of the words in ?5.1 may also be considered as belonging to Aramaic noun patterns, rather than Arabic forms suffixed with Aramaic endings, e.g., r&amp;hdya, waqh4ta. Cf. Leslau, all loc. cit. in n. 38 above. 41See Leslau, ibid. 42 See ?6.2 below. 43 See Leslau (1957), p. 232 (uses only native pl. ending); Leslau (1956b), p. 209 (same); Sabar (1974), ?18; Sabar (1975a), p. 285; Sabar (1975b), ?3.3. 44 Unlike the Ethiopic dialects; see n. 43 above. As in Arabic dialects in general, in the case of the sound pl., only the oblique case ending (-Tn) is used; see Blau, p. 106. 45 See n. lIa above. See Blau, p. 108: 'ust&amp;1n "masters," etc.</page><page sequence="6">206 Journal of the American Oriental Society 104.1 (1984) eyes, visions," bunuid "intrigues"; 'arwdh "spirits," askdl "images, icons"; waldd(&lt; awld "offspring. 5.7. Some nouns have both plural forms, the Ara- maic and the Arabic:falake- aflJak "celestial spheres," maqbdre - maqdbzr "burial grounds," ma'bjide - macbidat macbadTn "idols," bartlle - bart lat "bribes."46 5.8. The Aramaic plural ending is superimposed on the Arabic plural form: hawale (&lt; Dahwal) "condi- tions, " fu Cale - fu cle (&lt;aficl 'afJdl) "feats," mllkTne (sound plural ending instead of Damlak) - milke "estates, possessions.

Some Arabic broken plural forms appear as 48 -versa, a singular noun in Arabic is singular, and vice-esasnuanoniArbcs used as a plural or collective noun: Danwdr49 "fire, light," Darzdq "livelihood," 'arjal "lifetime," kamdm "cloud(s)," jawdhir "precious stone" (pl. jawdhzre); bunud "intrigue(s)"; jirfye50 "maid(s)," rahme "mercy" (sg./ pl.), xazTne "treasure house(s)"; caqdr "estates" (sg. in Arabic). 6. MORPHOLOGY: QUALIFIERS 6.1. As in NA in general, native adjectives agree with the qualified noun or pronoun in singular mascu- line and feminine, but in plural the masculine form serves both masculine and feminine, e.g., yarTxa (sg. m.), yarixta (sg. f.), yarTxe (pl. m. and f.) "long." However, in the case of borrowed adjectives, the singular masculine is used invariably with all four categories,5' e.g., tole'ta rakixta u~zacTf"worm (f.) (is) soft (f., OA) and weak" (m., Arabic), 'ene hasuid-fla "his eye (f.) is envious" fm.), baxte haldl gyane "his own lawful (m.) wife," nafs xdlhs "pure (m.) soul" (Arabic f. noun); sul(tne c'ddl "just (sg.) rulers," gzbbdre c ffm "mighty sg.) heroes," kullu dilmin uqdtil "all of them (are) enemies (sg., K.) and mur- derers (sg., Arabic)," xdhls hdwax "we shall be exempted (sg.)." 6.2. Exceptions (agreement does occur):52 baxta didi h5ya haramta "my wife shall be forbidden (to you)," mtallaLTn-Vlu "they are triple (pl.)," gpefi cazizln ufarjfln "they become beloved (pl.) and eminent (pl.)," hdwe tdlhbTn dhaqqa "they shall be seekers of truth." This is especially so in the case of adjectives treated as nouns: tre ?arjf Tn "two eminent persons," yd gfillTn "O fools," hwi minnid Dane qani 'In uakirdn "Be (counted) among the content and grateful ones." 6.3. Some nouns are used as adjectives: tasal "care- free" (&lt; tasaliT, inf. of s--y V), kzrayat "ugly" (&lt; kard- hat "aversion"), hatlke "disgraceful" (&lt;"disgrace"), kasad "unsalable" (&lt;"unsalableness"); mgabTne "too bad!" (interj.) (&lt; mu,&amp;dbana "defraud in a bargain"), ta'se "alas!" (&lt; tacs "unhappiness"). Occasionally an adjective may become a noun: diyydri "gift" (&lt; diy&amp;rT "domestic, for the house"); zarar "necessity" (&lt; zaruirr "necessary"). 6.4. Adverbs in Arabic may be expressed by nouns either in the oblique (nasb) case or with a preposition. However in NA the case ending is omitted: yaqTn (- byaqrn) "certainly, wholeheartedly" (= yaqTnan), ddyzm "always" (= dadiman), majan (- 'il majdn) "vainly, in vain," lazim "inevitably"; tahaqqat "surely, certainly" (&lt; tahqTqdt "verifications"). Cf. also qawi "very, strongly, greatly" (&lt; "strong," adj.).53 However, the use of nouns with prepositions is more common,54 e.g., 'il batale "in vain, vainly," 'il gafle "suddenly"; b'ax-r "finally, at last," bzdhir "openly," bldyiq(i)55 "properly," bhaqqa "truly, indeed," bizz5r "by force," beer hawan "untimely," bmurfiwe "beseechingly, kindly" ("with manliness"); an interesting case is b 'arju "beggingly" (lit. "with I beg (you)"), "please."56 6.5. In a few cases a noun with a preposition is used as an adjective: bzarb "violent, grave," baazab "angry, violent," bhaqqa "true, truly." Cf. Aramaic bxdye "alive" (lit. "with life"). 6.6. For the comparative the Arabic elative (af 'al) is occasionally used instead of the analytical NA phrase: 'as cab - b ? sa'ba "harder, more difficult," 45a Cf. other such examples below, ?5.8; see Blau, p. 108: wlad "children," shdb "friends." 46 See &gt;-abar, all loc. cit. in n. 43 above. " See Leslau (1958), p. 157. 48 See Leslau (1956a), p. 25; Sabar, ibid. 49 Specifically as in the NA translation of the Biblical "pillar of fire" and "pillar of cloud" (Exodus 13:21). 50 In this and the following two examples the Arabic sg. f. ending -e coalesces with the NA pl. ending -e. 5' See Sabar (1974), ?23; Sabar (1975a), p. 286; Sabar (1975b), ?3.4. 52 Especially as a predicate; see Sabar, ibid. 53 See n. 8 above. An interesting "absurd" example is qawi zac'f-Tle "he is very ('strong') weak." 54 See Leslau (1956a), p. 26. " This word is also declined: bidyiqox "as affordable by you," blayiqe "as worthy for him." 56 Cf. also the declined form hdgak, lit. "far be it from you" used invariably, e.g., hadgk minnid 'ildha "Far be it from God; God forbid!" hd~ak minnid hdzirln "Far be it from the present (audience)."</page><page sequence="7">SABAR: Arabic Elements in the Jewish Neo-Aramaic Texts 207 Daqdam "(more) important, senior (official)"; Da'zcm(!) (- bis' bzarb) "more grave, severer."57 7. MORPHOLOGY: VERBS 7.1. With some modifications, Arabic roots are freely borrowed and easily integrated in the NA verbal system. In addition to the regular basic roots, new roots may be created from the derived verbal patterns, e.g., t-k-y "to recline" (&lt; ittaka 'a, w-k- ' VIII), t-f-q "to occur" (&lt; ittafaqa, w-f-q VIII),58 x-t-r "to select" (&lt; ixtdra, x-y-r VIII). 7.2. This is especially so in the case of new roots of four or more radicals: t-f-s-r "to interpret" (&lt; tafsrr, inf. of f-s-r II), t-y-b-x "to reproach" (&lt; tawbTx, w-b-x II);59 D-n-k-r "to refuse" (&lt; Dankara, n-k-r IV); s-t-h-l "to merit, to deserve" (&lt; ista hala, '-h-l X), s-t-h-y "to desire" (&lt; istaha, s-h-y VIII); s-t-'-b-r (&lt; ista'bara, '-b-r X) "to consider." 7.3. As in the case of Aramaic roots, verbs having identical second and third radicals (C1C2C2) shift to second radical -y roots (CIyC3): h-y-b (&lt; h-b-b) "to like, "f-y-r (&lt; f-r-r) "to fly," q-y-r (&lt; q-r-r) "to confess, to confirm" (thus coalescing with Aramaic q-y-r [&lt; q-r-r] "to be cold"), s-y-k (&lt; s-k-k) "to doubt,"s-y-d(&lt; s-d-d) "to block, to seal." 7.3.1. However, the change occurs only in the NA conjugations I (ground form) and IV ("causative"),60 but not in II (parallel to fa''ala), e.g., j-s-s (112 mjass5se) "to spy," s-b-b (112 msabbobe) "to cause.",6' 7.4. As in the case of Aramaic roots, verbs having a glottal stop (hamza) as the second or the third radical shift, respectively, to CIyC3 and CIC2y: s-y-m (&lt; s-'-m) "to hate, to loathe"; h-d-y (&lt; h-d- ') "to calm." Cf. also n-f-y (rare) - n-f-' (&lt; n-f-') "to be useful. ,6la 7.5. As in Aramaic, verbs with second radical w shift to second radical y: r-v-m (&lt; r-w-m) "to find appropriate, desirable" (thus coalescing with Aramaic r-y-m [&lt; r-w-m] "to rise"), r-y-j (&lt; r-w-]) "to creep (insects)," j-y-z (&lt;j-w-z) "to be possible, permitted," C-y-n (&lt; '-w-n) "to help." This change occurs only in the first and the fourth conjugations, but w is retained in the second conjugation: j-w-b (II mjawobe)62 "to answer," t-w-j (II) "to crown," c-w-n (II, derived from the noun 'awdn) "to act maliciously" 4-w-d II "to accustom" The root d-'-r "to return" seems to be derived from the participle form of d-w-r (da'ir, Arabic, or da er, OA?). 7.6. Proto-Semitic verbs with first radical w became 63 yC2C3 in OA (and North-West Semitic in general). Only three borrowed Arabic roots with initial w have been attested so far, and they seem to retain the w: w-j-b (IV) "to blame, condemn," w-k-l (II) "to ap- point," w-s-y (II) "to enjoin." It is also interesting to note that verbs of the primae y class in NA usually appear only in I (yqdra "to be heavy") and IV (mayqire "to make heavy") conjugations, whereas the only borrowed Arabic verb of this class, y-q-n "to be convinced" appears in the II conjugation (myaq5ne). 7.7. NA of NT has only six verbal conjugations, and out of these only three are basic, the other being variants, as follows: 1) I (qWdla), cognate of the ground form in Arabic; 2) II (mfad5re), cognate of faccala with root type (C, C2C3); 3) 112 (Mjassose), same as II with root type CIC2C2; 4) III (mtafsore), same as II with quadriradicals; 5) IV (maq!ole), causative, cognate of Arabic af 'ala 6) V (mis3tah5ye, mista'b5re), verbs with infix (s)t. Due to the limited number of cognate conjugations, compared with ten or so in Arabic, the borrowed Arabic roots have to be "squeezed" in the available NA conjugations, e.g., y-q-n II "to be convinced" (this meaning appears in Arabic conjugations I, V, X), q-h-b II "to prostitute herself" (= Arabic III, V); k-l-q I "to close" (trans.) (= Arabic IV) as well as "to be closed" (= Arabic VII); k-r-q I "to sink" (intrans.) (= Arabic I) as well as "to sink" (trans.) (= Arabic II, IV), "to be very involved in doing something" (= Arabic X); '-m-l II "to trade" (= Arabic III); b-y-r I, II "to feel helpless" (= Arabic I, V, X), IV "to make one feel helpless" (= Arabic II). It is interesting to 57 E.g., 'a'czlm minnid ymdya bdugla letn "(A sin) graver than swearing in vain there is not." However, the spelling [).czym] is dubious and may stand for czlm as well; see end of ?2.2 above. 58 In the case of t-k-l "to trust (in God)" it may be either from Arabic ittakala (w-k-l VIII) or OA t-k-l, itself probably from Akkadian takdlu (&lt; w-k-l); see S. A. Kaufman, The Akkadian Influence on Aramaic (Chicago, 1974), p. 106. 59 See Leslau (1956b), p. 209; Sabar (1975a), ?24; Sabar (1975b), ?3.2.1. Many quadriradical roots in Z. are derived from Arabic nouns, e.g., z-n-j-r "to chain" zinjfr "chain." 60 See ?7.7 below. 61 Cf. ?7.5 below. 61a See Blau, p. 83f. 62 In Z. also mrnaybe. 63 OA/H y-l-d is the cognate of Arabic w-l-d.</page><page sequence="8">208 Journal of the American Oriental Society 104.1 (1984) note that even in case of cognate conjugations, the borrowed root may appear in a different one, e.g., h- k-y II (but IV in Z. and Az.) "to speak, to tell" (= Arabic I); s-t-'-b-r (V) "to consider" (= Arabic VIII, for Arabic X means "to shed tears, etc.").64 7.8. Many new verbs are formed combining an Aramaic verb with an Arabic noun, e.g., (a) '-w-d (&lt; OA c-b-d) "to do, to make": -'azdye "to mourn," -hfle "to cheat," -qW1 "to make conditional," -xiydl "to fancy," -mine "to wish," la-garaz "to be impartial." (b) d-w-q (&lt; OA d-b-q) "to hold": -sahil "to slight," -CzzZlta "to honor," -bunud "to plot," -bkire "to rent," -bhabs "to imprison," -husta (&lt; hujjat) "to use a false excuse," -nTye "to grudge."65 8. LEXICOLOGY 8.1. The percentage of Arabic loanwords in NT is quite high. Out of 1050 lexical entries of one typical text, 315 entries were borrowed, directly or via inter- mediary languages, from Arabic. In some prosodic instances almost the entire vocabulary is Arabic and only the declensions are Aramaic; for example, yd yisrda'J, la qatlht nafs majdn, uhissox la fasditin surtid Dinsdn, ugimsabbibit igyanox qitla bger hawdn, mud bsurtid s'arf xhqle 'ildha 'insdn, umzoyinne bmantiq ublhsdn "O Israel, thou shalt not kill a soul in vain, and beware of harming the image of man, and (thus) cause thyself untimely death, for God had created man in the image of the Eminent, and had adorned him with (the faculty of) logic and tongue." 8.2. The extent of the Arabic elements morphologi- cally and semantically is almost unlimited. In addition to the major morphological classes already mentioned, occasional borrowings from other classes occur as well,66 e.g., (a) prepositions: cannld (&lt; Can) "about," sob "beside," tla-xdtpr "for (the sake of)"; (b) other particles: yd "O" (vocative particle); Dinni "that" (rela- tive pronoun), "because" (conjunction and intensify- ing particle); Dinkdn "if," laykan "lest, must not." The definite article appears only in compounds: rabb al- CdlamTn "Master of the universe," bTs al-masTr "bad lot, bitter end." 8.3. Due to the religious character of the texts the major semantic areas of borrowing seem to be as in the following: (a) Religious, theological and spiritual terminology,66a e.g., fatwe "religious opinion" (- H. halakha),67 'a~tr-dydt "the Ten Commandments," haldla (- H. kd?,Fr) "ritually pure," hardma "ritually forbidden," hurme "wife, lady" ("forbidden [to others]"), tobe "repentance," fa?hztydta "abominable rituals" (= H. to Cbd); 'ar? "the Divine throne," xdlhq "Creator," max/lqdt "creatures"; ma'buide "idols," '- b-d "to worship idols," kdfirin "infidels"; 'isldm "Islam"; qudrita "Omnipotence" (referring to God, to avoid anthropomorphism), 'izzita "Glory," jaldhta "Splendor," ni'mlta "Grace." (b) Political, adminis- trative and juristic affairs: wazTre "viziers," 'amTre "emirs," hikim "governor," hakoma (- tuldtna) "king, sultan"; qasra "(royal) palace," qdziyiqa "jurisdiction, judge's office," dd'i "plaintiff," mzddaci "defendant (civil law)," da'we "plea," qardr "confession, admis- sion"; 'ilim "science." (c) Material culture: dawilta "wealth; government," filsa "small coin," mdl "prop- erty," 'aqdr "estates," mahsu "profit," '-m-l "to trade," maslaha "transaction, business"; risds "lead (metal)," nuqra "silver," p/lad "steel"; manzal "way station," 'arabdna "wagon," maskan "residence," mawtan "home region"; 'ays' "subsistence," rizq "means of living."68 8.4. It should be noted that many Arabic loanwords have synonyms from Aramaic or other languages, e.g., maqbar - betqora (OA) "cemetery," dunye - 'cljm (H.) "world," xalunta - xdta (OA) "sister," bahhar qulzum - yam saf (H.) "Red Sea," 'axirita - Cdand (H.)- pafrez (K.) "the end of days." 8.5. Some loanwords have developed a new mean- ing, such as nuqra "silver" (&lt;"silver ingot"), julle 64 See Leslau, ibid; Sabar, ibid. 65 See Leslau, ibid; Sabar (1974), ?24; Sabar (1975a), p. 288. 6, Some of these are loan translations from K.; see below, ?8.9; Noeldeke, pp. 405ff. for a list of such translations. 66a See Leslau (1956a), p. 34; Leslau (1956b), p. 213; Leslau (1956c), p. 284; Leslau (1956d), p. 141f.; Lesalu (1957), p. 244; Leslau (1958), p. 167. It is interesting to note that OS/ OA loanwords in old Arabic occurred also in the domain of religion; see Fraenkel, pp. 266ff.; Jeffery, pp. 19ff.; Yushmanov, p. 22; Noeldeke, pp. 389f.; see below, ?8.8 and n. 80. 67 It is somewhat surprising to see such emotionally loaded Islamic terms used for Jewish religious matters, instead of (or together with) H. ones; see Sabar (1974), ?26 (sex "member of the Jewish burial society"); Sabar (1975a), p. 290 (molla [&lt; mawid] "Jewish or Muslim learned man"). To this category belong also epithets such as: ta'cda "Exalted be He (= God)"; say'yid al-fazl "Master of virtue (= Moses)"; badr al-zaman "Full moon of (her) time (= Queen Esther)." 68 See Leslau, ibid. 69 See Sabar (1974), ?25; Sabar (1975a), p. 289f.</page><page sequence="9">SABAR: Arabic Elements in the Jewish Neo-Aramaic Texts 209 "clothes" (&lt;"horse-cloth, pack-saddle"), daxia "grain crops" (&lt;"revenue, income"), macqal "noble man" (&lt; "reasonable"), q5i "conditional agreement" (&lt; "say- ing"), hamd "self-control" (&lt; "praise"),70 cawdn "in- triguer" (&lt; "repeated war"),7' sudad' "distress, danger (of sinking: boat)" (&lt;"headache"), hissox "beware!" (&lt;"your sense"), mahzar "marriage-union" (&lt; "pres- ence, assembly"), h-j-r ikis "to have intercourse with" (&lt; "came to"; cf. H. bd' 'el, euphemism); qat 1) "(not) at all" 2) opens a question, e.g., qat SItin "Is there . . ?" (an influence of H. kelfim).72 An interesting case of mutual influence exists between the verbs s-m-x (OA) and h-m-i (Arabic): Arabic NA OA h-m-I 1) "carry, bear" "stand" 2) "be pregnant" s-rM-x __ 1) "stand, "stand, support" support" 2) "be pregnant" 8.6. It is interesting to note that even in close NA dialects, loanwords may acquire quite different mean- ings. For examplef-r-h "to be glad" in NT, but "to be scared" in Z.; h-i-k "to annihilate, destroy" in NT, but "to soil, to dirty" in Z.; da'we "plea" in NT, but "wedding" in Z.; manzal "way station" in NT, but "dark storage room" in Z.; barnTva "jar of oil" in NT, but "dumpling rich with fat meat" in Z.; h-i-h-i "to ululate" in NT (as in Iraqi Arabic), but "to become worn out and thin (cloth)" in Z.73 8.7. The gender of loanwords may change, perhaps influenced by the gender of a native synonym,74 such as markab (f.) "boat, ship" (cf. saftna, f.), bahhar (f.) "sea" (cf. ydma, f.);75 'askar (f.) "army," jawahir (f. sg.) "pearl"; feminine nouns ending with -a (&lt;-at) morphologically coalesce with masculine native nouns, and hence they may become masculine: feka (&lt;flakiha) "fruit," nuqra "silver," barn~ya "jar."76 8.7.1. Aramaic being a sister-language of Arabic, it is not always possible to determine whether a word or a root is native or borrowed; for instance, bdla "atten- tion," matla "parable," t-r-k "to abandon," s-r-x (OA s-r-,h)77 "to cry out," b-h-t "to be dismayed," ,sb "beside." 8.8. Some Arabic loanwords had already been at- tested in OS, as is also indicated by their spelling- pronunciation: qalwa (&lt; OS qalib &lt; Arabic qdlib) "(metal) bar, mold," qapla (OS qafJa &lt; Arabic qdfila)78 "caravan"; in ?-l-m IV "to become a Muslim" the Arabic meaning is superimposed on the Aramaic verb (already so in OS), whereas in saldmdtiye "peace offerings"79 the H.-OA meaning is superimposed on the Arabic root. Note also that some OA/OS loan- words in old Arabic are among the Arabic loanwords in NA, such as t-y-b "to repent," tobe "repentance," dTn "faith," jahannam (- gehinndm, gehdna) "hell," 'clam "world, people," millita (- 'immzta) "nation."80 8.9. There is no doubt that many of the Arabic loanwords had been borrowed via the intermediary contact languages, Persian-Kurdish and Turkish, as is occasionally indicated by their spelling-pronunciation81 or newly acquired meaning, such as dawilta (P. dawlat) "wealth," sall-he (P. salih) "weapons,"' ma'ndye (with the P.-K. izafe), nuqsdni (K.) "shortage," xuldsi (K.) "salvation," ftka (K. &lt; fdkiha) "fruit," diyydri "gift" (K. &lt; "residential"), had "access, daring" (T. &lt; "limit, border"), zarb (T. &lt; darb) "shock, wonder." This seems to be also the reason for the various spellings of the same Arabic word, e.g., mahrfimTn mahramin (P.), xidme - xilmrta (K.), cizze- 'zzita (P.-K.). This influence may also be observed indirectly, 70 E.g., zille mhamde "lost his self-control; submitted to (sexual) seduction." Cf. Z.: si bhamdox "walk slowly, patiently." 71 From which a new verb, C-y-n (2) II "to act maliciously, to lurk" is derived. 72 Only the first meaning exists in Arabic; see W. Wright, A Grammar of the Arabic Language (Cambridge, 1955) 1, p. 286. 73 This variety in meaning is especially common in quadri- radical (onomatopaeic) roots, e.g., h-i-h-i (Hava): "to weave thin. To sift with a fine tissue. To repeat (sound); to bewail (the dead: Druse); to pronounce the Mohammadan formula of faith; to threaten to become a Moslem (angry Christian)." Cf. Yushmanov, p. 22: "?armata is in Egypt 'rag,' in Syria ,whore. 74 See Blanc, p. 148: bMb "door" (f. in the Muslim dialect but m. in the Jewish and Christian dialects); Blau, p. 96; Sabar (1974). ?20; Sabar (1975a), pp. 286f.; Sabar (1975b), ?3.3.1. 75 But m. in OA. 76 But f. in Z. 77 See above, ?3.1.3. 78 See above, ?3.1.2. 79 See Sabar (1975a), p. 290. 80 See n. 66a above. On Aramaic loanwords in the Arabic dialects of Iraq see the references in Blanc, p. 173 (al- Calabi), p. 177 (Canfma). 81 See n. 19 above.</page><page sequence="10">210 Journal of the American Oriental Society 104.1 (1984) such as via word order, idiomatic use, and so forth. For example, flan ndaa - fldnkas (K.) "so-and-so"; in Arabic fuldn follows the noun, whereas in K. it pre- cedes it, as shown by the variant;" '-w-d mine"to wish" (lit. "to make wish") &lt; K. mine kirin; haddid manTle "Who will dare?" (lit. "limit-of who-is") &lt; T. kimin haddine. On the other hand, P.-T. loanwords may be borrowed via Arabic, as is occasionally sug- gested by their spelling, such as fange "rifle," as in the Arabic dialect of Aleppo &lt; P. tofang.83 8.10. Some words seem to be Arabic, but are obscure, and I could not find them in the dictionaries. For instance, nazim [nzym] "of inferior quality (metal),"84 frantlye [prntyyh] "(golden) coins,"85 talgdm86 [ulgm] "pure (silver)," MJlan87 [so'ln] "God will!" (&lt;in s'd'a alldh?), qunbare88 "tunnels, caves" (but in P.-Arabic, Z. "crest, bomb, shell"), matardye [mtryyh] "shoulder garment (against rain?)" (= Arabic "mug" but mimpara "waterproof garment"),89 sawad "cattle" (&lt; Arabic sawad "numerous flock"?), mindaja referring to a certain activity of Moses on Mount Sinai, perhaps from Arabic mundjd "confidential intercourse"; h3]an [hwjn] "provided only that, as soon as" (&lt; Arabic hawjan "necessarily"?), madwe [mdwwyh] "suffering, affliction" (&lt; Arabic d-w-' "to be ill" or Biblical H. madwe?), qarTr d'arwdh "happy souls?" (&lt; Arabic qarTr al-'ayn "happy"?), d-b-l "to wrestle" (&lt; "to beat with a stick" in Arabic, or "to be pressed together (fruits)" in OA?), j-g-r "to be vexed, angry" (&lt; Arabic j-k-r "to be vexed" or P. jagar "sorrow"?), s-m-s-q "to stroll, to enjoy free time," mistahib [msthyb] "awesome" (&lt; Arabic h-y-b?). 82 See the common use of x5? (P.-T.) in Iraqi Arabic dialects, e.g., x5? walad "good boy" (Blanc, p. 151). 83 See Blanc, p. 148; cf. Z. tfakke. 84 Perhaps related to manzzum "mordillM, Alc. mordiscada cosa medio comida" (Dozy). Cf. K. nizm "low," P. nazlm "6mist, cloud." 85 Related to P. parand "pearl, glittering"? 86 Perhaps of T. origin. 87 Pronunciation suggested by Avidani (see n. 11 above); often translates H. yihT rdson. 88 A translation for H. mehillht, niqrot. 89 The context does not suggest "raincoat" i.e., xa matarlye miftaxir, kulla dehwa "(She was wearing) a sumptuous coat, all of it gold"; a translation for Talmudic siriqon "silk-stuff, silken garment" (Jastrow, p. 988).
