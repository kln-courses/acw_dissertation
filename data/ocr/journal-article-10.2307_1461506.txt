NOEL discipline "on the boundary"-to employ the entirely fitting phrase of Paul Tillich-between the theological and the artistic imaginations. With characteristic elegance and erudition, Scott attempts, in his own studies of modern literary works, to heed closely the statements he believes it to be literature's function to make about our existential situation. Only by such an attentiveness, he insists, can Christian theology sustain the relevance of its answers to the questions lived by modern man. As an apologetic strategem, there would seem to be little to quarrel with here; yet as literary criticism, it has elicited demurrers from scholars of literature and religion alike. J. Hillis Miller, commenting on a work edited by Scott, raises "the vexed question of the degree to which the theologian or religious phil- osopher is justified in taking literature seriously as a testimony to the spiritual condition of a time," for he harbors the fear that "literature belongs to another dimension altogether." Miller's fear is expressed with sympathy for the general project of theological literary criticism, because, as he stresses, "a separation of theology and literature would tend to reduce literature to triviality, for meta- physical presuppositions in a work of literature are fundamental and determine its other aspects."3 William Spanos, another literary commentator, focuses Miller's worry on the specific area of apologetics by warning of the dangerous tendency of Chris- tian critics "to appropriate artists who are committed to other than Christian beliefs as Christians or approximate Christians."4 While Spanos apparently exonerates Scott from this excess, Robert Fitch, a theological onlooker, is less lenient. Fitch claims that while "nine-tenths of Nathan Scott's writing gives us superb criticism... the last tenth ... is outrageous theologizing." By this he means to implicate Scott in the "pious imperialism" against which the Chris- tian apologist is cautioned: "Let us call ourselves Christian, acknowledge that there can be great literature composed from another perspective than our own, and let us beware of a pious imperialism which tries to stake a claim on every appearance of excellence."5 In her Literature and the Christian Life, Sallie TeSelle suggests the con- nection between these caveats and the Tillichian method of correlation so cen- tral to Scott's apologetical theology of culture. Mrs. TeSelle sees Tillich's correlationism as expressive of a "religious amiability," which she describes as "an open-handed acceptance of culture in general and of the arts in particular because culture itself is crypto-religious."6 This attitude, in turn, "results in a 'J.

Thus, for example, she makes much of Scott's negativistic misreadings of modern literature, em- phasizing "his unwillingness to speak of the not insignificant portrayals of joy, love, fun, human fellowship, and animal good spirits in modern novels."9 She also seems to concur with William Spanos' wish that Scott "would rely more heavily on the formal as opposed to the thematic aspects of modern works."10 But rather than exploring precisely what it is in his theology that would produce such negativism and "thematism"-what in it actually prevents Scott from seeing secular affirmation or mediating form-she prefers simply to foreclose on the possibility of there being a theological criticism at all. She counsels "theologian-critics" to leave aside the explication of specific literary texts and to content themselves with prodding secular literary scholars "into doing the sort of criticism that has always been the glory of the profession-the criticism that dares to suggest what a work says through the way it says it.""1 That ad- justments in their theology would allow future theological critics to do such glorious criticism escapes Mrs. TeSelle, for, as she asserts, "the major criticism that I have made against the theologian-critics pertains to their criticism, not their theology."12 Surely it ought to be clear that if Nathan Scott, as a Christian literary critic, is in certain respects a bad critic, it has everything to do with his theology and the sorts of exchanges it permits between religious thought and modern litera- ture. These elements of Scott's work cannot and should not be strictly segre- gated.

NOEL adopt here, and from it we see that the possibility of a theological criticism deserves a continued commitment, and Mrs. TeSelle's advice must be rejected. This means that whereas she dismisses Scott's book The Broken Center from her consideration of his practical-critical misreadings on the grounds that in it he is "primarily a theologian, not a critic,"1" we need for this very reason to con- sider it a crucial document. And it is such not only for discerning the exact theological allegiances and entailments which give rise to the failings of his criticism, but also for inferring from those failings the hermeneutical imperatives laid upon any theology which would aim to analyze modern literary texts. The present essay, therefore, attempts to diagnose more fully the exegetical errors ascribed to Nathan Scott by searching out their source within his theology as articulated in The Broken Center. It is hoped that with a close inspection of Scott's actual rhetoric we may effect an assessment which, avoiding any negativistic or thematistic unfairness itself, can provide a sound basis for specu- lation on the implications of Scott's work for the future of theological criticism. I Subtitled Studies in the Theological Horizon of Modern Literature, The Broken Center is representative of Scott's recent thinking in that six of its seven chapters are revisions of essays previously published over the eight years since the appearance of Modern Literature and the Religious Frontier in 1958. In- deed, in the preface to his later work Scott describes it as a resumption of the effort begun in the earlier one. While we are not primarily embarked here on a developmental study, it may be worthwhile to proceed through Scott's chap- ters in the order of their original publication, devoting a separate section to his culminating statement, "The Crisis of Faith in the New Theology and the Pro- mise of Grace in Poetic Art," which is the latest-written and the only original essay in the book. The opening chapter of The Broken Center is directed to a depth analysis, I" bid. It should perhaps be added here that in a recent essay in review of a work by Walter Stein, Mrs. TeSelle seems to modify her rigid compartmentalization of theology and criticism. Unfortunately, while her endorsement of Stein's defense of Christian criticism allows for a theological literary criticism, it does so in such a way as to again fail to zero in on the possible theological causes of critical failure. Thus, for example, all successful critics are urged to become aware of the deepest theoretical presuppositions of their criticism, which are bound to lie somewhere in "the Judaic-Christian Western humanistic tradition." But we can only infer that for Mrs. TeSelle the failure of a critic is always a practical and never a theoretical problem, which means that although Christian theology is no longer to travel as an invisible man in the land of literary criticism, it now has diplomatic immunity. This is still an insufficient integration of theology and criti- cism with which to confront the hermeneutical questions raised by literary modernity, and it is significant that the "pay-off" for Mrs. TeSelle in her affirmative response to the Stein book comes from his chapter on King Lear, not from his overly thematistic readings of modern texts.

It begins by carrying forward the frontier metaphor of the 1958 book, pointing out that what has most fundamentally given [the artist's] life the aspect of crisis has been that recession of faith and that erosion of the religious terrain announced by Nietzsche in the nineteenth century, and, in our time, by Sartre. . ... [In] a late bad time . . . when the traditional premises regarding the radical significance of things have collapsed and when, therefore, there is no longer any robust common faith to orient the imaginative faculties of men with respect to the ultimate mysteries of existence . . . then the literary artist is thrust upon a most desolate frontier indeed." However, it is the Yeatsian title of the later book that even more aptly bodies forth our period-style for Scott, since eccentricity, fragmentation, and anarchy are the most definitive qualities of reality post mortem Dei. In the face of such a forlorn prospect Scott informs us that the modern writer "has had to become, in a sense, his own priest, his own guide, his own Vergil" (p. 8), and is forced into "pursuing a system of values or beliefs in the world of his own subjectivity" (p. 9). Scott closes his baleful pathology report with the belief that "what one feels to be formative in much representative literature of our period is the profound need for a deep restoration of confidence in the stoutness, reliability, and essential healthiness of the things of earth" (p. 19). Mistrusting the common, the immediate, and the familiar, the modern literary imagination finds itself, in this viewing, an isolato, lost in the mazes of extremity. Does Scott see no hopeful sign in all this? He does, but only after a fashion. He grants that for all its "icy alienation" and denial, our literature's paradigmatic hero is a figure who reveals "what Tillich calls 'the courage of despair'-the courage, despite everything problematic and uncertain in his world, to affirm his humanity" (p. 23). This message of faith-despite-nihilism becomes, then, a subdued word of hope to the attentive theological imagination: If the high forms are once again to appear at least possible for us, their reinter- pretation must be informed by the kind of awareness that comes from facing the distresses of life without any of the supports and consolations of religious faith. And so, in the attentiveness with which the religious community today often listens to our poets and novelists and dramatists, we may discern some earnest of the reconstructive role that may yet be played by modern negation and denial (pp. 23-24). Here is the apologetically salutary attentiveness mentioned at the outset of the present essay as one of Scott's main stresses. It should be recognized, how- ever, that this is almost the nearest he comes in The Broken Center to hearing " Scott, The Broken Center: Studies in the Theological Horizon of Modern Litera- ture, pp. 2-3.

NOEL a word of health from modern literature to an ailing theological sensibility, and even here it is a word heard only "despite" the cries of pain which constitute literature's predominant naming of the nature of our period-style. This opening essay of Scott's book bears out the accusation of his negativism insofar as in it he fails to hear an unequivocally encouraging note from modern literature. More subtly and more significantly, we must see that for Scott even the courageously despairing vision of secular literature is valuable only as an aid in reconstructing the religious center broken with the Nietzschean deicide, in re- storing the possibility of what Scott revealingly refers to as "the high forms." We shall return to a discussion of this rather reactionary notion of religio- cultural vitality in a later context. For now suffice it to say that this means that Scott is scarcely entertaining the possibility that modernity might, in and of itself, build something both novel and valuable. He is ignoring the possibility, for instance, that becoming one's own priest, guide, or Vergil could represent a gain over the psychopomposity of traditional religious supports and consola- tions;15 or that the modern pursuit of values and beliefs in the world of sub- jectivity could have the positive result suggested by the title of an important phenomenological study, Experiencing and the Creation of Meaning: A Philo- sophical and Psychological Approach to the Subjective;16 or that some currents in contemporary literature could be attempts to confirm and implement Nietzsche's deicidal plea to remain faithful to the earth and his warnings against the unhealthiness of Christian ressentiment.'7 Moving on to "Faith and Art in a World Awry," we find it too much a continuation of the negativism just uncovered in the first essay to merit any extended treatment. Here Scott envisions literature's somber communiqu6s from the miasmas of penultimacy, evoking from the Christian community per- suasive news of rescuing eschata in a full-blown Tillichian correlation of existen- tial plight and kerygmatic cure. However, according to "The Bias of Comedy and the Narrow Escape into Faith," apparently modern literature in its comic mode can contribute some- thing to human existence fully as affirmative and healing as the Christian kerygma. A comic hero like Chaplin's Tramp or Cary's Gulley Jimson (unlike, say, Sartre's Roquentin) "grapples," as Scott puts it, "with the thickness and the density of the concrete world of human experience, delighting in all its smells, sounds, sights, and tactilities. The comedian is not generally an aviator: He does not journey away from the familiar world of earth; he refuses the experi- ment of angelism; he will not forget that we are made out of dust" (p. 101).

But upon closer inspection we discover that even in its most affirmative mode modern literary expression is never affirmative apart from Scott's quali- fying "despite." He reminds us that comedy's point is always that "our health and happiness are contingent upon our facing into the fact that we are finite and conditioned, and therefore subject to all sorts of absurdities, interruptions, inconveniences, embarrassments-and weaknesses. This is," Scott concludes, "the courage that the comic vision requires of us" (p. 94). William Spanos is certainly justified in saying that Scott's interpretation of the comic gesture (which Spanos traces through Christopher Fry and Charles Williams to Dante) construes it as the "most difficult of all" the options open to the modern literary artist.18 In any case Scott admits that there are "few great comic geniuses in the modern period" (p. 89). In fact, "The Tragic Vision and the Christian Faith" goes on to indicate that any converging affirmations of a "robust materialism" in Christianity and comedy may be beside the point of contemporary relevance: "Man has become a question to himself and, in this icy aeon of perplexity, he feels the definitive category of his self-interpretation to be that of the tragic" (p. 121). This category, in turn, is shown to entail "an unpalliated vision of shock and crisis, and of man in the extremest possible situation where all guaranties of meaning and security in his pilgrimage on earth have disappeared" (p. 131). There- fore, between the tragic vision and the Christian faith we would expect to see Scott reporting only the sharpest sort of antithesis. At first such an expectation is confounded by Scott's appeal to the traditional Christian concept of an "interim period between that disclosure of history's meaning which occurred in the drama of the Incarnation and that final fulfillment of its meaning which is . . . expressed in the symbol of Christ's 'second coming' " (p. 138). Never- theless, it eventually comes out that in the final analysis the fully Christian man becomes a question to himself only in a curiously rhetorical sense, because even if the Christian faith (in its involvement in the interim period) follows the tragic vision "directly into the fields of anguish," Scott has to admit that it descries beyond them "the horizons of a brave new world" (p. 144). It turns out for him that while modern comic literature can offer no answers to man's existential questions that the essentially comic vision of Christianity does not already have, the tragic literature which is most centrally expressive of our secular modernity has no answers at all. In examining "Society and the Self in Recent American Literature," Scott directs his attention to the novel and decides that contemporary practitioners of that genre in this country are above all "committed to the registration of the ' Spanos, "The Critical Imperatives of Alienation," pp. 93, 95.</page><page sequence="8">354 DANIEL C. NOEL self's experience of its own inwardness in an adverse world" (p. 223). He feels it is ironic that with this commitment our literature has produced so few me- morable characters in comparison with the "tough, assertive, tangy figures" in the recent British novel. Unlike American heroes, these "live in the human polity, they are creatures of history, and, in them, the mettle of the self has been tried and proven in the matrix of a dynamic culture" (p. 227). Only by learn- ing from "the traditional Christian soulscape" (p. 230), Scott claims, can American novelists again people their own works with such characters, since "without something at least analogous to the sacramental vision of reality that is created for Christianity by its doctrine of Creation and of the Incarnation ... the likelihood is that, when faced by entangled and unpromising circumstances of life, the writer may be able to manage nothing better than a querulous retreat into the privacies of the isolate self" (pp. 230-31). This pointed diagnosis of recent American fiction leads Scott into a disagreement with R. W. B. Lewis which further exposes the flawed theological foundations of the former's criti- cism. For Scott, "our granting R. W. B. Lewis the point he has made, that the ambiance of the new American novelists in an irredeemably post-Christian dispensation" (p. 229), is at the least a tactical blunder, considering what Scott sees as the demonstrable need of these writers for a Christian-like sacramental vision of reality. But this sidesteps the point Lewis wants to make in observing the post-Christian environment of American literature. His main thrust is felt in his statement that "the fact is-to judge from recent literature, anyhow- that the old subject, the old community, the old order seems past recovery."19 This is an assessment which Scott obviously fails to confront by asking Lewis to exert "a more critical pressure on the literary imagination at the present time" (p. 230), for Lewis' claim clearly implicates Scott's Christian soulscape--the fulcrum required for exerting the pressure--as well. Furthermore, to the extent that Lewis is right, Scott's request is tantamount to asking that an outmoded doctrinal standard be prescribed to contemporary literature. Lewis has himself questioned the hermeneutical worth of such a procedure in the following terms: "What is open to doubt is not the value of a theological approach to literature, but the value of approaching this particular body of literature with any set of terms and doctrines that has been fully and finally elaborated, historically, once and for all."20 Whether this is indeed the case with Scott's set of terms and doctrines, as his reaction to Lewis would imply, can be judged more accurately as we move ahead to scrutinize the next chapter of The Broken Center. "Mimesis and Time in Modern Literature" apprises us at some length of what Scott calls the "neo-Gnostic" or-following Jacques Maritain (p. 53) and " R. W. B.

This is the experiment in angelism which, as we have learned, is refused by the few comic heroes of recent art but precisely succumbed to in the majority modes of our writing. Scott here juxtaposes with it the tendency in recent theology (Bon- hoeffer, the later Barth, Bultmann, Gogarten, Fuchs, Ebeling, R. R. Niebuhr, J. A. T. Robinson, Oscar Cullmann) toward what Carl Michalson termed "an historical critique of the theological reason" (p. 65). It is noted that the juxta- position points up "a sharply reversive movement: for whereas the literary imagination often wants very much to escape from time altogether and to find a timeless eternity, the theological imagination . . begins to be most ardently committed to the timescape of history and begins to regard the eternity of the traditional Christian vision as misconceived, if not chimerical" (p. 65). The countervailing character of these two trends suggests to Scott the possibility of a "Christian mission" whereby "the theological community may assist the artist in learning something of the same lesson in his sphere that it has already learned in its own" (p. 66). We are quickly led to understand that such a mission would involve no at- tempt to sponsor a program of "art for religion's sake." Rather, it would en- courage a dialogue between theology and literature in which it would be theol- ogy's role "to cherish, to admire, and thus indirectly to commend, some of the great examples ... of the modern imagination reckoning with the world out of an acceptance of the fact that human life is irrevocably committed to time and to history" (p. 68). The examples (which is to say the exceptions) whom Scott cites are Eliot, O'Casey, Brecht, Joyce Cary, William Carlos Williams, Heming- way, Silone, Camus, and Auden. These are all said to be men who in their unquerulous acceptance of the irrevocable temporality of the human condition . .. in various ways furnish examples apart from which any greatness in the things of literary art must be very unstable indeed: and, for this reason, it is to such artists as these that the Christian critic of modern literature ought perhaps to turn for his proximate models of health and sanity of spirit (p. 76). Scott's essay "Mimesis and Time" nearly convinces us that, after all, he does allow some exceptional representatives of literary modernity to prescribe stan- dards, or contribute answers, of their own. Unfortunately, it is again in the last accounting a Christian theological paradigm dictating which secular authors are to be commended as models of health and sanity of spirit. Moreover, the paradigm is not one drawn primarily from current theology, for here in the chapter on temporality, as in Scott's treatments of the present period-style, comedy, and American fiction, the central norms spring from the conservative Catholic sacramentalism associated with names like T. S. Eliot and Charles Wil- liams, Jacques Maritain, Allen Tate, and Dorothy Sayers, rather than from the post-neoorthodox theologians of the "historical critique." It is only from such a ' Tate's complicity in the use of Maritain's label "angelism" is noted in Spanos, "The Critical Imperatives of Alienation," p. 93, n. 7.</page><page sequence="10">356 DANIEL C. NOEL conservative vantage that in addressing modern literature Scott can recommend restoring the high forms of premodern culture, view the comic as modern literary art's inherently hardest ploy, and advise that American novelists adopt a sacra- mental vision of reality. It is the same essentially Dantean perspective, we also realize, which gives rise to all the blatant or latent negativism in Scott's critical approach. And not only modern literature, but contemporary theology as well, is judged by this standard. As becomes evident in "Mimesis and Time," this is how Scott determines which current theologians, or which aspects of their thought, are to join in reconstructing the integrated medieval sensibility with those modern comedians and tragedians deemed resistant to the angelistic temptation. We have already seen how all other exemplars of literary modern- ism ate either rejected as neo-Gnostic escapists or assigned the negative role of providing the poisons to which Christianity is the antidote. We should expect to see uncooperative theologians faring no better at Scott's hands as we carry our analysis forward and seek corroborative evidence of his employment of what would have to be called an outmoded theological norm. The important thing to clarify here is that on the basis of his own rhetoric, rather than because of any baldly stated credo, we are indeed finding Scott's theology to comprise, at its core, a "set of terms and doctrines that has been fully and finally elaborated, historically, once and for all." Perhaps an illustra- tion of why approaching modern literature with such a theology is, to reiterate the suspicions of R. W. B. Lewis, of doubtful value lies in comparing Lewis' explanation of the "doctrines" of American literature with an aside in "Mimesis and Time." Lewis warns that "the doctrines of Hawthorne and James, of Emerson and Thoreau, of Poe and Melville, like those of their twentieth century followers, are for the most part not received abstractions put into imagistic forms. They are 'transcendental world-views' created by the very play and pressure of the images invoked."** Scott shows a reluctance to attend to the play and pressure of literary imagery when he sets out to defend the Maritain-Tate critique of angelism as a critical norm overriding all formal-linguistic considerations. He begins by granting that one cannot assume that what is defective in the modern sense of time has utterly disabled our literature, for that would be patently nonsensical, since much of the writing that one has to cite as exemplifying the problem-Proust's Remembrance of Things Past, Joyce's Ulysses, Rilke's Duino Elegies-is ... chiseling on the hard- est stone and must, in the splendor of its art, evoke astonishment at the sheer magnificence of its lordship over language. But surely it is permissible to believe that, other things being equal, the artist in whom there is a profound acceptance of temporalitas may have a better chance of winning "surprises of grace" than he who rebelliously refuses the human condition. (pp. 67-68) "'Lewis, "Hold on Hard to the Huckleberry Bushes," p. 477.</page><page sequence="11">NATHAN SCOTT AND THE NOSTALGIC FALLACY 357 The possibility to which Scott's theological stance has blinded him is that the message of the mediating form and language of the greatest modern art, neo-Gnostic or otherwise, may entail a redefining of the human condition. This is an instance of the thematism of which Scott has been accused, the practice of looking past literary forms to themes. It is, as we shall see in the next section, directly traceable to the way the medieval sacramentalism of his theology leads him to see through, and thus ultimately past, the finite to the infinite. Together with the negativism discussed earlier, Scott's thematism is confirmation of Lewis' worst suspicions, constituting evidence not only that the application of an out- moded doctrinal standard to modern literature is worthless, but that it even has an hermeneutically deleterious effect. It therefore deserves the label "the nostalgic fallacy," a warning by Sallie TeSelle being the actual source of the adjective: Nostalgia for the supposed integrated sensibility of the Middle Ages can be a comforting sedative but hardly a plan of attack on our dissociated sensibilities. And there is a bit of conservatism of one sort or another in many of the Christ- ians who have spoken to this problem in our life and art. T. S. Eliot, Malcolm Ross, Allen Tate, and Erich Heller see the best of all possible worlds as one in which finite reality is naturally and instinctively referred symbolically to infinite reality.' Mrs.TeSelle's failure to relate Scott's practical-critical performance to the contours of his particular theology prevents her from realizing that the kind of nostalgic Christian conservatism she here derides aptly names the theological source of the errors she elsewhere attributes to Scott's criticism. In fact, Erich Heller, one of the men she cites in her description of Christian nostalgia, is the dedicatee of Scott's essay on "The Crisis of Faith in the New Theology and the Promise of Grace in Poetic Art," in which we now need to seek for further examples and ramifications of the nostalgic fallacy. II The crisis of which this chapter speaks begins with the Nietzschean madman of the Frdhliche Wissenschaft, and while there is no more worthy origin for any religious dilemma, Scott's reading of it is open to question. He maintains that it would doubtless be to mistake Nietzsche's intention, were his declaration that God is dead to be taken as a metaphysical doctrine. For, in this connection, it is significant surely that he never contended that there was no God, but said rather only that a deicide had been committed on this earth. It seems likely, in other words, that he was not intending to put forward a proposition about some super- sensible event that had taken place in the realm of noumenal reality: he wanted rather to give us, in melodramatic fashion, a judgment about the direction and * TeSelle, Literature and the Christian Life, p. 35.</page><page sequence="12">358 DANIEL C. NOEL tonality of our culture. In short, when he asserted that God is dead, he was speaking not in the role of metaphysician but in his capacity as observer and diagnostician of modern civilization, and what he really wanted to announce was a "great refusal" which modern man himself had made (p. 147). Although Scott opens the succeeding paragraph with something of a disclaimer ("But however Nietzsche's message is finally to be assessed, in its various minutiae..."), his interpretation here is an important initial indication of the overall thrust of his essay. This can be seen by comparing Scott's Nietzsche with W. Richard Comstock's: Thus the God of western Christendom has been the moral, metaphysical and sacred point of unity, whereby man's cosmos revealed its meaning, importance, and ultimate value. The "death" of this God means not only the end of belief in a certain anthropomorphic deity, but, more important, the death of all the functions that he performed for western man.... With him goes the religious aspect, the metaphysical structure, the sacred dimension of existence." Comstock shows that it is not necessary to claim that Nietzsche was intend- ing to advance a metaphysical proposition in order to make the point that his parabolic or mythic language did refer to noumenal reality, at least insofar as the mythos of God's death specifies the demise of any Ding-an-Sich. To say, with Scott, that the death of God is modern man's great refusal is to imply that modern man need only "accept" God. That is, it is itself a refusal of the Nietzschean pronouncement on the supposition that the problem is within the reach of a voluntaristic solution. And this is exactly a function of the nostalgic fallacy pervading Scott's approach. But while Scott's delimitation of the Nietzschean vision which helped to usher in modernity commits the reader to an unrealistic sense of a fully modern man's options, his neglect of the Nietzschean sense of gain following from God's death is perhaps equally misleading. Scott notes that the dedicatee of his essay has pointed to "the mergence in Nietzsche of the figures of Jacob and Pro- metheus" (p. 147, n. 3). He fails to mention that even the conservative Heller, after citing this conjunction, also indicates that the death of God leads to a mergence of negative and positive results: "'God is dead'--this is the very core of Nietzsche's spiritual existence, and what follows is despair, and hope in a new greatness of man, visions of catastrophe and glory .... "25 When Scott does refer, in passing, to "a creature bearing the glamor of that lonely grandeur which Nietzsche expected to distinguish the post-Christian man, the man whom he called the 'superman' " (pp. 152-53), it is only to claim that such a man cannot be found in an exemplary modern novel like The Stranger. Indeed, his slighting of this hopeful side of Nietzsche's message complements his reduction of the death of God to man's great refusal. Together, these misreadings provide the "*Comstock, op. cit., p. 269.

In continuing to trace the currents which have given rise to the new theology, Scott calls our attention to a cast of mind distinguished by an inability to descry in the world any reality that evokes a sense of ultimacy or of radical significance. This is a kind of total secularization of consciousness that is, to be sure, most sharply focalized in the collapse of theistic faith; but, in its deepest aspect, it entails not so much the loss of connection with anything resembling what Rudolf Otto in The Idea of the Holy called "the numinous": what is basically lost is the sacred, and the great impoverishment of the human spirit consists in the death of all awareness of any animating power or presence amid and within the familiar realities of nature and history (p. 150). The important factors to notice in Scott's description are that it speaks only of loss and that it contrasts with this process of flattening (elsewhere referred to as "banalization," "profanization," "desacralization," "platitudinizing," and "level- ing" [p. 154]) a familiar model of health and sanity. For the "charming aesthetic" of the Chinese Mustard Seed Garden Manual he appeals to here, in which the "whole of reality is instinct with spirit and with presence, with the numinous and the Sacred" (p. 151), is barely distinguishable from the medieval ideal in which, as we have heard, "finite reality is naturally and instinctively re- ferred symbolically to infinite reality." Since the new theologians are those who primarily follow Dietrich Bonhoef- fer in affirming the very movement of modern consciousness Scott is lamenting, it is clear that his sympathies lie with the "traditionalists" whom he says "are today shivering with a most desperate anxiety before the new wave of 'religion- less Christianity' that seems prepared to spend with a reckless profligacy the 'Catholic substance' of Christian theological tradition" (p. 161). The image of Catholic substance is tell-tale, as is the appearance of the term fides perennis when he completes his chronicling of the new theology and begins his assault upon it: Yet, however impossible it may be for the modern sensibility to acknowledge as credible the notion descending from the fides perennis of a God-thing whose existence is rationally demonstrable, one cannot altogether escape the feeling that the new theology (if one may be permitted so homely an analogy) is by way of throwing out the baby along with the bath water (p. 171). Scott's attack on the radicals is notably dependent on his account of their work, since a debatable assignment of the definitive role to Paul van Buren al- lows him to tar all of the new theology with the brush of van Buren's admittedly positivist proclivities. The capstone of the argument Scott builds to show van Buren as more radical even than William Hamilton or Thomas Altizer is the oft-remarked fact that van Buren "cannot even understand, as a propositional statement, Nietzsche's proclamation of the death of God" (p. 167)---a fact which Erich Heller, again, would say brands van Buren as decidedly pre-</page><page sequence="14">360 DANIEL C. NOEL Nietzschean and un-radical in sensibility.26 This additional, if indirect, instance of his failure to follow the Nietzsche interpretation of the man to whom the chapter is dedicated is crucial to Scott's misrepresentation of radical theology as the spiritual offspring of A. J. Ayer. At this point, drawing upon Ernest Gellner's critique of the analytic heirs of logical positivism, Scott equates the pathological modern process of the flattening out of sacred presence with the analysts' world view, one which, he believes, "is statable in such a proposition as, 'The world is what it is,' or 'Things are as they are,' or as it was put in the proposition by Bishop Butler-which G. E. Moore took over as a kind of motto of his own philosophy-'Everything is what it is and not another thing'" (p. 154). With this collusion once posited, the new theology (seen sub specie van Buren) can then be charged as an accomplice when Scott explains just how it threatens to throw out the baby with the bath water: In the process of relegating to the discard the old anthropomorphic dilutions of Transcendence, the new theology-in its servile attitude before the norms and standards of a positivistic culture-is close to expelling the Transcendent itself from our life-horizon. And it is just at this point that we can see something of the enormous price that a religionless Christianity is about to pay for the prize of "relevance" in what is called a post-Christian world.... [That price is] to con- fine the human spirit within an absolutely finite province of meaning: it is to settle for a world-view quite as impoverished as that which Ernest Gellner renders by the proposition, "The world is what it is" (p. 173). In order to be absolutely certain about the perspective from which such a critique can be conceived, it will be helpful to refer again to Sallie TeSelle's discussion of Tillich's theological imperialism, relating it, as she does not, to this precise act of Scott's thinking. She compares "the problem T. S. Eliot epitomizes in his famous phrase, 'the dissociation of sensibility,' and the one Tillich speaks to in his insistence on the participation of the finite in the infinite, of all finite meaning, beauty, goodness, and being in an ultimate ground," and decides that the two problems reduce to one: "Very simply, finitude cannot sustain itself."27 Mrs. TeSelle's comparison assures us that it is only from a nostalgic medieval viewpoint that Scott is able simultaneously both to castigate the theological radicals (after misrepresenting them as positivists) for focusing on a finitude which he finds impoverishing and applaud certain aspects of Tillich's thought (after listing him in the genealogy of the new theology). In point of fact, "Heller, in ibid., p. 176, refers to Nietzsche as follows: He never said that there was no God, but that the Eternal had been vanquished by Time and that the Immortal suffered death at the hands of mortals: God is dead. It is like a cry mingled of despair and triumph, reducing, by comparison, the whole story of atheism and agnosticism before and after him to the level of respectable mediocrity and making it sound like a collection of announcements by bankers who regret they are unable to invest in an unsafe proposition. I TeSelle, Literature and the Christian Life, p. 34.</page><page sequence="15">NATHAN SCOTT AND THE NOSTALGIC FALLACY 361 Scott's acceptance and use of Tillich's notion of the depth or transparency of the finite, as of Gabriel Marcel's distinction between objective problem and onto- logical mystery, is entirely dictated by his nostalgia for an integrated pre- Cartesian sensibility: What is surprising and distressing is not that certain of our younger theologians should be having their difficulties with the doctrine of God and should be in something of a muddle as to how persuasively to recast the case for a theistic position. The really astonishing fact is that they should be so overborne by these difficulties as to want to redefine our human life-world in such a way that the question of ultimate reality may be adjudged an unreal and illicit question. For this is surely a most treasonous foreclosure of the real horizon that men face-which is intersected again and again by radical Mystery, by disclosures in and through the realities of our finite world of "a transfinite dimension," "a tap root which seems to connect" them "vertically as it were, with what Paul Tillich has called the ultimate Source, Ground, and Abyss of all finite reality" [Theodore M. Greene]. As Dr. Tillich himself said in one of his finest sermons, "You cannot think or say: Life has no depth! Life is shallow. Being itself is surface only." (p. 174) Now not only does Scott here plainly beg the questions raised by radical theology (or raised for theology by Nietzsche) when he presumes that the radicals must be prompted by essentially apologetic difficulties to "redefine our human life-world" or to effect "a most treasonous foreclosure of the real horizon that men face." He is also showing us the underpinnings of his antiformalistic readings of modern literary texts. It is, after all, the idea that finitude cannot sustain itself that leads him to see through, and thus ultimately past, the finite to the infinite, and which therefore underlies his critical bypassing of literary forms in search of transcendent themes. That is, if Scott maintains that the mind "has the experience of beholding the ordinary realities of everyday and of finding that, all at once, they become, as it were, transparent, so that they can no longer be taken for granted" (p. 175), we want to reply that if ordinary realities, or the assuredly finite media of literature, become transparent, as he says, that is precisely when it becomes almost impossible for them not to be taken for granted. Ironically enough, for Scott, this looking beyond the finite to the infinite, beyond the surface to the depth, beyond the linguistic and for- mal elements of a work's structure to its themes or religious messages--all of this is itself a kind of neo-Gnosticism or angelism. That the anti-radical theology producing Scott's thematism is inadequate to deal with modern literature can be seen from another angle by juxtaposing the language of Scott's theological critique with J. Hillis Miller's portrayals of our characteristically formalist modern poetry. In his Poets of Reality Miller begins by noting that "the death of God is the starting point for many twentieth- century writers,"28 and then pursues the attempts of poets like Yeats, Eliot, Thomas, Stevens, and Williams to move beyond nihilism into a new realm of SJ. Hillis Miller, Poets of Reality, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 2.</page><page sequence="16">362 DANIEL C. NOEL "proximity." This is a realm in which our human life-world is indeed per- meated by "presence," but not at all a sacred presence of the Beyond in the immediate or of a transfinite dimension through the finite: "If there is to be a God in the new world it must be a presence within things and not beyond them .... It is the presence of things present ....1"29 Scott's criticism of the theological radicals for daring "to confine the human spirit within an absolutely finite province of meaning: ... to settle for a world-view quite as impoverished as that which Ernest Gellner renders by the proposition 'The world is what it is' " would therefore have to be his question-begging judgment on these paradig- matic modern poets as well. Furthermore, when Miller's poets move into their "new region of copres- ence" they abandon the major Tillichian variation on the Dantean theme of Scott's theology--the concept of "depth": The disappearance of dimensions of depth in twentieth-century art provides special difficulties for someone trained in the habits of romanticism. An abstract expressionist painting does not "mean" anything in the sense of referring beyond itself in any version of traditional symbolism. It is what it is, paint on canvas, just as Williams' wheelbarrow is what it is .... In the same way the characters of Williams' fiction, like those of the French "new novel," have little psycho- logical depth." And Miller adds that examples of the new immediacy may be found in widely divergent areas of con- temporary thought and art: in the flatness of the paintings of Mark Rothko and Franz Kline, as opposed to the romantic depth in the work of Paul Klee; in the "superficiality," as of a mystery which is all on the surface, of the novels of Ivy Compton-Burnett or Alain Robbe-Grillet .. .81 By contrast, back in his essay on "The Bias of Comedy" Scott includes Robbe- Grillet among "writers who live under a spiritual dispensation essentially the same as that classically emblematized by such earlier modern texts as Hugh Selwyn Mauberly and The Waste Land and The Magic Mountain and The Castle and The Sun Also Rises" (p. 79). Scott is simply unable to acknowledge a view- point that is not in some way a testimony to the medieval vision or to a longing for that vision, and it is because classical modernism does, in some respects, betray such a longing that he wishes to classify a Robbe-Grillet as he does rather than confronting, with Miller, the roots of post-modern depthlessness and atheism in even a Yeats or an Eliot.32 2 Ibid., p. 10. 8 Ibid., p. 9. Emphasis added. 81 Ibid., pp. 10-11. 8 It may be that one way of defining the post-modern is by saying it is the exacerba- tion and extension of elements of modernity beyond the point of being assimilable (either positively or negatively/dialectically) by Christian apologetics. In Scott's latest two books-Craters of the Spirit and Negative Capability--as well as in his contributions</page><page sequence="17">NATHAN SCOTT AND THE NOSTALGIC FALLACY 363 If the real horizon of Miller's "poets of reality" discloses any religious presence at all, it is what Miller calls "a fugitive spiritual power . .. . within things and people."33 And it is more than likely the difficulty of articulating the logos of this power (rather than any apologetic retrenchments) that exer- cises the most radical of the new theologians Scott upbraids. Unsurprisingly, therefore, it is not the poets of reality who hold out, in Scott's view, a "promise of grace" to a contemporary theology in dire need of "a restoration of health and sanity" (p. 177). This promise is offered only by poetic attestations to a "sentiment of Being" (Wordsworth) --either positively, with the English Ro- mantics and their heirs, or negatively/dialectically, with the conservatively con- strued literature of our time: "In this very abysmal sense of abandonment and dereliction that pervades our poetry and fiction and drama, there is also an infinite longing ... " (p. 185). And so, instead of the eschewal of all imperialisms toward secular art which the title seems to suggest, "The Crisis of Faith in the New Theology and the Promise of Grace in Poetic Art" gives us the ultimate refinement of the nostalgic fallacy: Nietzsche and modern poetry misread so as to serve in a last ditch attempt to undo the work of a theological radicalism which Scott calls theology's "latest excursion into 'modernism"' (p. 182). The standpoint revealed here might have been appropriate in Pascendi, the 1907 encyclical of Pius X, but it is hardly the sort of basis we need for a viable theological criticism of modern literature. III To recapitulate our omnibus critique of The Broken Center: By closely con- sidering the "way" of Scott's text as the proper reflection of the "what" of his theology, we have found Scott to be guilty of the nostalgic fallacy. By this we mean that Scott's theology of culture gradually reveals itself as controlled by a conservative Catholic sacramentalism, or Dantean vision of religio-cultural syn- thesis, which comprises an outmoded set of terms and doctrines-and therefore an inadequate hermeneutic-with which to approach modern literary works. The fallaciousness of applying such a standard is seen precisely in the negativistic and thematistic misreadings it produces, first in Scott's view of the relation be- to the Adversity and Grace volume, the specifically post-modern problematic comes into greater prominence (which means, in the nature of the case, that the nostalgic fallacy is committed with greater violence to literary meaning). These recent writings of Scott are dealt with by the present author in Daniel C. Noel, "Post-Modern Literature and the Idea of Grace," Cross Currents, XX, 1 (Winter, 1970), 99-102. Tom Driver, a most skilled and sensitive Christian critic, includes an extremely suggestive discussion of the notion of the post-modern as it affects Tillichian correlationism in his review of one of Langdon Gilkey's latest works.

Remembering Hillis Miller's remark that "a separation of theology and lit- erature would tend to reduce literature to triviality" as well as R. W. B. Lewis' assurance that "what is open to doubt is not the value of a theological approach to literature," we must reject Sallie TeSelle's proposal to cease doing theological criticism. But the question remains as to what kind of theology would be cap- able of mounting a cogent or non-fallacious criticism of our period's literary expressions. Without being able to present a systematic constructive statement within the scope of the present essay, we can at least attempt an answer to this question and suggest a few of its implications. Once we allow for Scott's tendency to accord more centrality to positivism than is warranted, his own nostalgically condemnatory descriptions of post- Nietzschean theological radicalism, in their terminological similarity to Miller's picture of the poets of reality, are a sort of back-handed clue. Inquiring after what would account for this resemblance, we are led to the probability that it is the shared willingness of the poets of reality and the most radical of the new theologians to ground their speaking and thinking on the shifting and uncer- tain surfaces of contemporary secular life. It could just as well be depicted as the motivating intention discussed by Maynard Kaufman in his account of "Post- Christian Aspects of the Radical Theology": ... there is widespread sympathy among theologians for the concerns which motivate these radicals, even among those who do not think it is possible to do theology this way and therefore retreat back to the faith of their fathers. But if one appreciates the intention of the radical theologians to articulate the positive in secularization it is not possible to do theology as it has been done either. Traditional Christian theology can provide one with criteria for understanding the contemporary situation only in a distorted form .. .". To Kaufman, one implication for religious reflection of this intention is that "if we are to speak of the contemporary situation constructively we must speak in terms of a post-Christian theology."35 With Kaufman's discussion in mind, we conclude from our reading of The Broken Center that in order to understand modern literature in an undistorted form a theology must be able, as Scott's is not, to articulate the positive in secularization. That is, it must be a radical theology, which also amounts to saying that it must accept the post-Christian expressions of contemporary cul- ture as sources or standards for theologizing. With such a drastic methodo- logical reconception once posited as the overriding imperative, however, we ought in closing to review it in such a way as to suggest some of its repercus- sions, both for theological criticism and for theology generally. "Maynard Kaufman, "Post-Christian Aspects of the Radical Theology," in Toward A New Christianity: Readings in the Death of God Theology, ed. Thomas J. J. Altizer, New York: Harcourt, Brace and World, 1967, p. 346. "Ibid., p. 347.</page><page sequence="19">NATHAN SCOTT AND THE NOSTALGIC FALLACY 365 Langdon Gilkey may be the most sympathetic of the traditional Christian theologians to the concerns which motivate the radicals-nothwithstanding, we should add, Nathan Scott's acknowledgement that an unpublished essay of Gilkey's "partly inspired" his own emphasis in "The Crisis of Faith" chapter (p. 169). But even Gilkey's sympathies do not extend to the radical reorienta- tion of theological method entailed by the stance of an Altizer or a Hamilton. He bridles, for instance, at their "use of literature as a direct source of theologi- cal reflection . . . as an authoritative basis for ideas in Christian theology." While he realizes that literature has theological implications and has long been seen as voicing religious meanings, Gilkey asserts that this ... is not the same thing as saying that secular literature can or should be an originating and self-authenticating source for theological concepts, or that it provides criteria for determining the rightness or contemporaneity of theological reflection. To maintain this is, of course, to deny any trans-cultural origin of essential religious notions and to regard as valid a theology growing directly out of the cultural consciousness itself, as expressed in art, literature, and science." Now aside from the fact that we want perhaps to substitute the word bracket for the word deny in the second sentence and to ask, regarding the first, how else is the contemporaneity of theological reflection to be determined, the per- ception here is acute enough. Gilkey correctly sees from inside the tradition, as Kaufman does apparently from outside it, just how great a shift is necessitated by the logic of radical theology and how small is the likelihood that this shift can be accommodated within Christian theology qua Christian. This is, again, the methodological new beginning required for the theological literary criticism of modern texts. It is when he goes on to contend that radicalism casts the theologian in the role of "amateur literary critic"37 that his vision starts to fail him. But before it does so he helps us perceive a curious kind of complementarity. For Gilkey's claim about the inevitable amateurism of the radicals' activity can be quickly refuted by pointing to the base of competence provided in the new discipline of Religion and Literature Nathan Scott has done so much to foster (as well as by appealing to the authorizations of professional literary scholars like Miller and Lewis). And beyond Gilkey's error there is his insight that radical theology must do literary criticism of our expressed cultural consciousness in order to find criteria and sources. If we compare this with the conclusion drawn after our close reading of The Broken Center that theological criticism of modern literature must be radical in order to have an adequate hermeneutic, we see that we are not looking at two "8Langdon Gilkey, "Sources of Protestant Theology in America," Daedalus, XCVI, 1(Winter, 1967), 93.

Looking still closer, a single radical theological criticism is revealed in which literary criticism is done in order to find criteria and sources with which to be radical, which in turn is in order to have an adequate herme- neutic with which to do the literary criticism, and so on. Perhaps here, finally, the re-naming of theo-logy demanded by the mythos of God's death receives its ratification, and something like the poetics of religion- of our post-Nietzschean, and therefore post-theistic, and therefore post-Christian, faith or spirituality-begins.</page></plain_text>
