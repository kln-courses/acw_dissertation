<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE rather than by considerations intrinsic to the texts themselves, the essay leaves the impression that the doctrine of God (as omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent, eternal, true, just, good, pure, and holy) is in fact a scholarly midrash on the multiplex sources. Nonetheless, the essay remains a valuable retrieval of information from a vast literature regarding such matters as the pronunciation of the tetragrammaton, the (91) names of God found in the midrashic and talmudic literature, and (in part II) material bearing upon early Jewish use of anthropomorphic language. In connection with the latter, the author inevitably is led to discuss allegory as an exegetical tool for handling biblical anthropomorphism; his contribution here is of lasting value. Some of the reservations expressed in these lines are clearly shared by Professor Werblowsky, who writes the preface to this edition. Nonetheless, Werblowsky welcomes the book back into print not only because many of the scholarly judgments contained therein have stood the test of time (e. g., Marmorstein's thesis that the euphemistic tradition surrounding the tetragrammaton enjoyed its own evolution, maqom being supplanted in the 3rd century C.E. by ha-qadoS baruch hu'), but because such issues as merits and anthropomorphic language are of contemporary theological relevance. W. SIBLEY TOWNER YALE DIVINITY SCHOOL The Septuagint and Modern Study, by Sidney Jellicoe. Oxford and New York: Clarendon Press, 1968. Pp. xix+424. $9. This comprehensive discussion of LXX studies in the present century is intended to supplement Swete's Introduction (revised by Ottley in 1914), not to supplant it. After an introductory chapter on modern LXX study, its antecedents, beginnings, and development, Professor Jellicoe divides his book into two parts. The first part, "Origins and Transmission-History" (pp. 27-171), has successive chapters on LXX origins (the Letter of Aristeas), modern theories of origin, early revisions (Aquila, Theodotion, Symmachus), Origen and the Hexapla, and the Trifaria Varietas (Origen's recension, and those of Hesychius and Lucian). In the second part, "Text and Language" (pp. 173-359), there are chapters on LXX MSS (with a descriptive list of all uncials, a brief discussion of cursives, and a survey of the more important papyri and fragments), the various versions, modern editions and text-critical studies of LXX books (esp. the Cambridge and G6ttingen critical editions), language and style, and the current situa- tion in LXX studies. Finally, two appendices (a comparative table of the MSS sigla employed in the Cambridge LXX, and a list of all the MSS and fragments collated in the Gottingen and Cambridge critical editions), a selected topical bibliography, and various indices complete this impressive and very useful resource volume. The book is clear and readable throughout. Printing errors are kept to a minimum, but the following corrections should be made: "more" for "ore" on p. 23 (n. 5); rephrase the third sentence on p. 29; "dependence" for "independence" on p. 98; replace the 230</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE broken letter in "n'1ln" on p. 121 (line 26); "B-M.I.ii.295-304" for "B-M.i.295-304" on p. 276 (n. 2); "nllJ';-o3" for "nil-1.o"" on p. 323 (line 3). Also, the totals on pp. 223-24 are apparently incorrect, since more MSS are said to be common to B-M and G6ttingen when the Psalter is not included (49 MSS) than when it is (46 MSS). On pp. 194-97, it should be noted under the uncial symbols H, K, and M, that Lagarde and also Rahlfs (in Sept.-Stud. ii) used them for the MSS 188, 190, and 27, respectively (as indicated on pp. 213-14). Note 4 on p. 239, concerning Papyrus Fouad 266, should also have a reference to F. Dunand's Introduction (see the review in JBL, 86 (1967), pp. 476-77). Due to J. D. Shenkel's recent publication, Chronology and Recensional Development in the Greek Text of Kings (1968), the brief remarks on textual and chronological problems in Kings (pp. 285 f.) will have to be modified. In the total discussion of Samuel-Kings (pp. 283-90), there is no clear treatment of the MSS boc2e2, of Barthelemy's suggestion that they alone preserve the OG in sections /3y and ya, and of F. M. Cross' response that they represent a genuine revision ("proto-Lucian") to the Palestinian Hebrew text used by the author of Chronicles, represented by 4QSama and 4QSamb, and known to Josephus (HTR, 57, 1964, pp. 292-96). Jellicoe's earlier discussion of Lucian's recension (pp. 157-71) also fails to take Cross' new evidence into account. The brief remarks on the Greek text of Jeremiah (p. 301) should have included some mention of the major divergence in length and order between the LXX and the MT. While the main point of pp. 324-29 (that apparent divergences between the LXX and the MT on the meaning of terms do not always reflect different Hebrew readings) is a good one, the examples chosen to illustrate it are not all equally compelling. Finally, the index of biblical passages should have been expanded to include references to the pages where passages are said to be preserved in MSS or in fragments. Although this review has concentrated on points that need to be corrected or supplemented, it has done so in the context of genuine praise for a very important contribution made extremely well. Students and scholars alike will find it very useful. KEVIN G. O'CONNELL, S.J. WESTON COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS Introduzione all'Antico Testamento, Vol. I: Dalle origini all'esilio, by J. Alberto Soggin. Brescia: Paideia, 1968. Pp. 301. L 2,200. The author of this first volume of an introduction to the OT should not be un- known to the reader, for he has published extensively for a number of years, particularly in German, and the quality of this work surely has established his qualifications for the task he has set himself. He is now professor of OT on the Waldensian Faculty of Theology in Rome. His work has the distinction of being the first of its kind, an in- troduction to the OT based on the modern approach to the subject, written in Italian. 232</page></plain_text>
