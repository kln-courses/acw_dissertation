Fol- lowing Italian law, work was suspended and ar- chaeologists were called in after the first ship was discovered. Moving quickly because con- struction could not resume until they were done, excavators found three more ships, cargo and other artifacts, and part of an ancient quay. One hull, 46 by 20 feet, is in particu- larly good condition. 'The wood seems to have been buried almost yesterday," says a project volunteer. 'The planking is still fastened to the frame with copper nails." Potsherds found nearby date the ship to the mid-second century a.D. According to project director Stefano Bruni of the Archaeological Superintendency of Tus- cany, the design of the hull suggests that it is a warship. If this is the case, says Bruni, "it will be the first known imperial warship whose structure survives rela- tively intact, contributing immensely to knowledge of the Roman fleet." This ship was empty, but the cargo of another vessel, dating from the first cen- tury b.c., was nearly intact. Amphoras (two of which were stolen from the exca- vation) contained a liquid residue (possi- bly wine); remains of cherries, plums, and olives; as well as sand from the Bay of Naples. Another freighters hull was very well preserved, but no cargo was found. Near a fourth, smaller boat, a wicker basket, a leather sandal, and a coil of rope were discovered. Sixteenth-century histories mention a part of Pisa known as the Porto delle Conche (Port of the Basins), after an an- cient inland harbor on the Auser River (now known as the Serchio). The loca- tion of the port, which no longer exists, was not known; Bruni speculates that it may at last have been rediscovered. Conservators are encasing the hulls in resin so they can be moved, allowing construction to proceed. The city and the archaeological superintendency hope to build a special facility where the pub- lic can view the ongoing conservation, which is expected to take several years, before the ships are moved to a museum tor permanent display. -ALS *4 Archaeology, May/June 1999</page><page sequence="2">J 0 S © 1 ' •8 I I t Í u !

During several months of excavation on the site of a future office complex in Spitalfields, a rescue team from the Museum of London also uncovered the foundations of a medieval priory and a Roman cemetery containing the remains of low-born Roman Britons in wooden coffins and simple shrouds. The sarcophagus is six feet long and weighs two tons. Out- side it were a 12-inch-long green glass phial and jet objects, possibly a cosmetics set, including a lidded circular canister, two disks, and two pointed rods. Inside was the lead coffin, decorated with scallop-shell designs. Francis Grew, the muse- um's archaeology curator, explained that the change from cremation to inhumation around a.D. 250, the use of jet during the late Roman period, and the style of the phial date the burial to the third or fourth century a.D. According to Jenny Hall, the museum s Roman curator, the richness of the grave reflects the affluence of London during a period when the city served as a prominent trade center and seat of the provincial treasury. The lead coffin is on display at the museum while conser- vators clean and treat the exterior in preparation for opening it. When the investigation is complete, the human remains will be buried in sanctified ground. Says Grew, "Until the opening, we can be sure of nothing save that no expense was spared on this burial." -Larkin Mitchell Borneo Cave Art Two with have groups been hundreds discovered of caves of hand in decorated northeast- stencils with hundreds of hand stencils have been discovered in northeast- ern Borneo, within the borders of In- donesia, confirming the presence of cave art on the island. A Franco-Indonesian expedition working on behalf of the In- donesian Ministry of Tourism, led by Jean-Michel Chazine of Frances Nation- al Center for Scientific Research and speleologist-photographer Luc-Henri Fage, found no archaeological material in the caves, leading them to surmise that they were probably used as sanctuaries. Based on stylistic comparisons with cave paintings on nearby islands, the re- searchers believe the art may be between 8,000 and 20,000 years old. Kalimantan, the Indonesian part of Borneo, is an area the size of France and had remained unexplored archaeological- ly until 1992, when French researchers began systematic surveys. Investigating mostly limestone caves, Chazine and Fage discovered the remains of numer- ous dwellings, then, in 1994, their first decorated grotto.

They are sometimes decorated with geometric designs whose meanings are unknown. It is thought the dolmens, which number in the thousands, were used for both burial and ritual purposes. Scientists worry that fantastic stories pro- mulgated by New Agers are misleading visitors into thinking the dolmens were built as launching platforms for UFOs or by little people who rode rabbits. A conservation project headed by Vik- tor Trifonov of the Institute for the Study of Material Culture History at the Rus- sian Academy of Sciences in St. Peters- burg has begun surveying and mapping the sites, restoring the dolmens, and ex- cavating areas threatened by tourists. Work began at Zhane, a site near the re- sort town of Gelendzhik on the Black Sea coast, which is now visited by as many as 100 people every hour. The site, consisting of three dolmens placed in a row about 30 feet apart, was excavated in 1997 and one of the dolmens, bulldozed in the 1950s, reassembled. Trifonov hopes to work with New Agers in pre- serving other threatened sites. -SPMH Deep Probe at Çatal Excavation Çatalhõyiik to the base of of began a the 75-foot-deep eastern this April. mound trench Fears at Excavation to the base of the eastern mound at Çatalhõyiik began this April. Fears that the site, near the city of Konya in central Turkey, is drying out prompted the probe. Çatalhõyiik is a key site in the study of early farming and the rise of cities (see Archaeology, March/April 1998, pp. 43-47). The high water table under the Konya Plain has kept the mounds lower levels saturated for the last 9,000 years, pre- serving organic materials that otherwise might be lost to decomposition and de- cay. As a result of increased pumping of water for agriculture, industrial, and city use in the early 1990s, the water table has been lowered, drying out the oldest levels near the base of the mound. This drying may cause artifacts preserved for millennia to deteriorate rapidly, resulting in the loss of environmental, economic, and dating evidence, and, possibly, com- plete examples of wooden containers, baskets, textiles, and incised wooden tablets, all known from fragmentary re- mains found in the 1960s. The World Bank has brought in hy- drological experts to assist the Turkish government in devising a technologically simple and cost-effective solution: irriga- tion ditches near the site will be filled, creating a moat around it and raising the water table locally. This will make it pos- sible to maintain the water level within the mound at any given point. Because the mound has already begun drying out, archaeologists will assess any damage that has occurred and determine at what level the water table should be main- tained. In a six-month campaign, they will extend a 1965 trench, carrying it through the mound's lowest levels, recording and conserving organic re- mains and artifacts and installing moni- tors to measure the water table. -Orrin Shane and Mine Kûçûk www.archaeology.org 19</page><page sequence="6">E I S £ v U 1 1 - ancient -eTTI-mN RU|NJ For the past 17 years, the staff of Far Horizons Archaeological and Cultural Trips has been designing unique itineraries for small groups of sophisticated travelers who desire a deeper knowledge of both past and living cultures.

In a forthcoming issue of Current Anthro- pology ' they argue that cooking arose among early Homo erectus about 1.9 million years ago. Because cooking ne- cessitated collecting food in one place rather than eating it where it was found, there was the risk of theft. When males stole food from females, the latter responded by offering food and sexual favors to males who would protect them. The first cooking is signaled by the smaller teeth and jaws, larger female body size, and larger brain size of H. erectus compared to its forebears, argue Wrangham and coauthors, as well as by possible hearths suggesting control of fire. In particular, they point out that many tubers, high in energy, are edible only when cooked; this important new food source would have helped H. erec- tus develop its larger body and brain. While body and brain size have been said to reflect an increase in meat-eat- ing, the authors note that modern African hunter-gatherers eat mostly plants and that among omnivorous ani- mals like chimpanzees, meat-eaters have smaller or only slightly larger bod- ies than plant-eaters. -ALS 20 Archaeology, May/June 1999</page><page sequence="7">s è Interested in All Things Ancient Egyptian?

Box 1475, Sebastopol, CA 95473-1475 USA Roman Shipwreck Off Alexandria The water b.c. cargo vessel about of lying one-half a mid-first-century under mile 30 off feet the of b.c. vessel lying under 30 feet of water about one-half mile off the coast of Alexandria has allowed re- searchers to reconstruct the ship's trade route. A team of six divers led by Jean- Yves Empereur, director of the Centre d'Études Alexandrines, found a mass of amphoras but no sign of the ship's hull, which was probably destroyed on the rocky seabed. Examination of the amphoras re- vealed three different varieties. The majority, some 495 examples, bore stamps on their rims and handles, and a number still had their stoppers, made of fired clay sealed with pozzolana, a kind of mortar. These were manufac- tured on the southeastern coast of Italy, possibly in Apulia or the neighboring regions along the Tyrrhenian Sea. The contents of the vessels have not been studied and none has been raised to the surface, but traces of resin on the inte- rior of some broken amphoras indicate they were used to transport wine. The two other types of amphoras, roughly a dozen of each, were of Cretan and Rhodian manufacture. The Cretan and Rhodian vessels were found on the surface of the de- posit, an indication of loading order and, consequently, the probable itiner- ary of the ship carrying them. In all likelihood, the vessel set off from south- eastern Italy after loading the largest part of its cargo. It then made a stop on Crete; study of the amphoras should de- termine where, since a fair number of the island's ancient amphora-produc- tion workshops are known. The ship then sailed' for Rhodes, where it added a small complement to its cargo and headed for Alexandria. The team suspects the ship took a direct route rather than following the Levantine coast; fourth-century b.c. lit- erary sources attest that ships were then making direct crossings. Whatever its adventures at sea, the unfortunate vessel was in sight of Alexandria when it must have struck a rocky outcrop, al- most certainly the one at the foot of which lie the amphoras. Without enough sand to envelop and protect the ship, its wood eroded from exposure to salt water and the sea's turbulence. -Colin Clement 22 Archaeology, May/June 1999</page><page sequence="8">Pacific Lizards or Red Herrings? New about question genetic the long origins data accepted are of Polynesians, calling views into question long accepted views about the origins of Polynesians, the inhabitants of the scattered central and eastern Pacific islands. After colo- nization of the Indonesian islands, Aus- tralia, and New Guinea by 40,000 years ago, the Solomon Islands southeast of New Guinea apparently formed the east- ern limit of human habitation in the South Pacific. Xhree thousand years ago, however, colonization -of islands farther east began. These later colonists were believed to have originated in mainland Asia, perhaps southern China, voyaging through the corridor of inhabited islands on their way east. In a recent issue of the American Journal of Human Genetics , Oxford Uni- versity's Martin Richards and his col- leagues reviewed the geographic distribu- tion of a set of shared genetic traits called the Polynesian motif. Many schol- ars have viewed the genetic uniformity of Polynesians as strong support for what is informally known as the express train model of rapid expansion out of a home- land in Taiwan or southern China around 6,000 years ago with little mixing between them and existing populations in Melanesia and Micronesia. Richards and his colleagues, however, found that the genetic evidence indicates the Poly- nesians came from somewhere in the voyaging corridor - perhaps eastern Indo- nesia betwéen southeastern Borneo and the Moluccas. Furthermore, the Polyne- sian motif has not so far been found any- where in China, Taiwan, or the Philip- pines, and it is thought to date back in eastern Indonesia something like 1 7,000 years. These findings contradict the tim- ing and geography of the express train model for Polynesian origins. Genetic evidence use^l to support the express train concept was recently pub- lished in the journal Nature by evolution- ary biologist Christopher Austin of the South Australian Museum. Austin exam- ined the DNA of a small Pacific island lizard {Lijpinia noctua) and found that on islands west of the Solomons it was ge- 24 Archaeology, May/June 1999</page><page sequence="9">netically diverse but on Polynesian is- lands it was more uniform. Austin be- lieves a few lizards (or even a single preg- nant female) could have stowed away on a canoe in New Guinea or a nearby is- land. Their progeny evidently then moved from island to island farther east into the Pacific as uninvited hitchhikers on voyaging canoes. Because this found- ing population was small, it had a re- stricted gene pool and therefore less ge- netic diversity. This, Austin claims, is evidence that Polynesians swept rapidly out of Asia. Many Pacific archaeologists are chal- lenging this conclusion. As anthropolo- gist Kevin Kelly of the University of Iowa notes, the lizard genetic evidence only deals with the unintentional human transport of this small creature from somewhere in the New Guinea area to Polynesia, not from Taiwan or southern China (where the lizard, in fact, does not exist). In short, the lizard genes tell us nothing about an ancient Polynesian homeland in Asia, or about how fast they moved to the central and eastern Pacific islands beginning 3,000 years ago. -John Terrell K-Man in the Lab The the newick first Burke Man round Museum has of been study in finished Seattle, of Ken- at newick Man has been finished at the Burke Museum in Seattle, almost three years after the skeleton was found on the banks of the Columbia River. The Army Corps of Engineers, which has jurisdiction over the river, originally decided to turn the 8,400-year- old bones over to Indian tribes for rebur- ial under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. Follow- ing a lawsuit by scientists seeking access to them, the corps asked the National Park Service for advice. Francis P. McManamon, the park service's chief archaeologist, determined that not enough was known about the skeleton and ordered studies to decide what to do with it. The examination consisted only of nondestructive tests: description and measurement of bones and teeth; analy- sis of soil sticking to the remains; obser- vations of bone trauma and tooth wear; and analysis of a stone point embedded in the pelvis. Though the results had not been released when Archaeology went to press, the scientists conducting the study did hold a press conference. Anthropologist Joseph Powell of the Uni- versity of New Mexico was quoted in a newspaper interview as saying, &lt;ťThe guy had some serious muscles. He would have made a good... football player. And he probably had a nasty chronic tooth- ache, given that his teeth were worn down to the roots." If the initial round of tests does not provide enough information to determine the disposition of the skeleton, the park service may call for radiocarbon dating, DNA analysis to assist in inferring ances- try, and stable isotope analysis to help determine diet.

Baffled village ing described peasants in Gansu by province in Chinese a windswept are news- be- village in Gansu province are be- ing described by Chinese news- papers as blond-haired, blue-eyed de- scendants of Roman mercenaries who allegedly fought the Han Chinese 2,000 years ago. While no one in the modern town of Lou Zhuangzi is fair and there is no proof that the Romans ever set foot in Gansu before the Christian era, the reports have revived discussion over whether a group of Romans offered their services, to the Hun warlord Jzh Jzh in 36 b.c. before settling in the Gansu village of Liqian, thought by some to be Lou Zhuangzi. This idea was first proposed by Homer Hasenphlug Dubs, an Oxford University professor of Chinese history, who speculated in 1955 that some of the 10,000 Roman prisoners taken by the Parthians after the battle of Car- rhae in southeastern Turkey in 53 b.c. made their way east to Uzbekistan to enlist with Jzh Jzh against the Han. Chinese accounts of the battle, in which Jzh Jzh was decapitated and his army defeated, note unusual military formations and the use of wooden forti- fications foreign to the nomadic Huns. Dubs postulated that after the battle the Chinese employed the Roman mer- cenaries as border guards, settling them in Liqian, a short form of Alexandria used by the Chinese to denote Rome. While some Chinese scholars have been critical of Dubs' hypothesis, others went so fár as to identify Lou Zhuangzi as the probable location of Liqian in the late 1980s. Ten years later, still no academic pa- pers have been published on the sub- ject, and no archaeological investigation has been conducted in Lou Zhuangzi, but the media and local government re- main unfazed. County officials, sensing potential tourist revenue, have erected a Doric pavilion in Lou Zhuangzi, while the county capital of Yongchang has decorated its main thoroughfare with enormous statues of a Roman soldier and a Roman woman flanking a Com- munist party official. -Erling Höh 26 Archaeology, May/June 1999</page><page sequence="11">i ! i 1 Highest Dig Yields Inka Sacrifices The two atop perfectly girls the 22,000-foot and preserved a boy Andean were bodies found vol- of two girls and a boy were found atop the 22,000-foot Andean vol- cano Llullaillaco in northwestern Ar- gentina by Johan Reinhard of the West Virginia-based Mountain Institute and Argentine archaeologist Constanza Ceruti.

"Great care was taken in preparing the sacrifices," said Reinhard, noting the llamas had been lined up as if in a caravan.

One girls body had been slightly damaged by lightning; the others head was deliberately deformed into a conical shape. The latter wore a white feathered headdress.

At a March 4 ceremony at the Turkish Embassy in Washington, Wil- liam I. Koch, the Boston businessman who has held the coins since 1984-85, announced that he was returning them. Koch was given a medal by Kenan Yurt- tagiil, acting director general of the Gen- eral Directorate of Monuments and Mu- seums, who expressed Turkeys gratitude to Koch for safeguarding the coins since the lawsuit began in 1989. The hoard - nearly 2,000 Greek and Lycian silver coins - was found in April 1984 by three treasure hunters near El- mali, north of Antalya. Among the coins were 14 Athenian decadrachms, possibly commemoratives struck after an Athen- ian victory over the Persians ca. 468/467 b.c. Before it was found, only 13 deca- drachms were known. According to a 1988 Connoisseur arti- cle, the treasure hunters sold 1 ,889 coins to a middleman, who sold them to a Mu- nich dealer for $1.325 million. Koch and his partners bought 1,750 of the coins for $3.2 million and began selling them in 1987. Turkeys efforts to recover the coins began to pay off in March 1988, when the Numismatic Fine Arts gallery, owned by Bruce McNall, was to auction ten of them. Turkeys lawyers halted the sale, and McNall returned the coins. Turkey learned that Koch and his as- sociates had purchased most of the coins and demanded their return. After Koch refused, Turkey began a lawsuit in feder- al court in 1989. On the eve of the trial, scheduled to begin on March 8, Koch agreed to surrender the coins. Turkeys attorney, Lawrence M. Kaye, said, "The recovery.*. is another out- standing example of Turkeys continuing success in its war against the internation- al traffic in looted antiquities that victim- izes so many nations." Even with this re- covery, however, more than 200 coins from the hoard are still unaccounted for. -MR 28 Archaeology, May/June 1999</page><page sequence="12">1 J I è i s I 3 S -s I i m Vegetarian Essenes? Twenty-eight the southern edge of Israel the spartan Ein may Gedi dwellings have oasis been on in Twenty-eight the edge of the Ein Gedi oasis in southern Israel may have been the home of a community of Essenes, the Jewish sect thought by some to have collected the Dead Sea Scrolls. While no inscriptions have been found positively linking the site to the group, its proximity to the village of Ein Gedi a mile away is grounds for assuming that its inhabitants belonged to the same community, says Yitzhar Hirschfeld of Hebrew University, the sites excavator. Descriptions of the Essenes by ancient authors such as Pliny the Elder "fit the character of the site," he says. Another clue is the presence of a mikveh, or Jewish ritual bath. The Essenes are thought to have flourished between the second century b.c. and the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem by the Romans in a.D. 70. Ancient sources describe them as a tightly knit group of men, possibly celi- bate, who practiced communal owner- ship of property. "The people who lived here worked the fields of the oasis," says Hirschfeld, who suspects that the site was a permanent, rather than seasonal, settlement. The dwellings were built for one person only and measure six by nine feet. They appear to have been oc- cupied twice, in the first and early sec- ond centuries A.D., and between the fourth and six centuries. Three larger buildings possibly had a communal use; one, likely a kitchen, had three stoves and a thick layer of ash on the floor. While the site yielded a fairly rich collection of pottery vessels, glass sherds, and seven coins from the early Roman and Byzantine eras, it is most remarkable for its laçk pf animal bones. "Although we worked carefully, sifting everything, we didn't find any," says Hirschfeld, adding that the settlers might have been vegetarian. Although Josephus noted that the dietary restric- tions of the Essenes were stringent, the nearby village appears not to have been bound by vegetarianism. "We've found 4,000 animal bones in the village of Ein Gedi," he notes. Judaism has histori- cally advocated vegetarianism only occasionally for ascetic reasons or dur- ing periods of mourning. Excavations will continue in the winter of 2000. -SPMH 30 Archaeology, May/June 1999</page><page sequence="13">Khmer Site Looted During dreds stolen the from of sculptures past the six Cambodian months, have been tem- hun- dreds of sculptures have been stolen from the Cambodian tem- ple complex of Banteay Chhmar, accor- ding to a recent New York Times report.

Set to begin in 2002, the three-year program will be offered to ten to 12 students every other year. The first year will be devoted to archaeology, anthropology, and conservation courses; the second will offer more technical training; and the third will include exca- vation and museum internships. "Tradi- tionally, conservators have been trained to work only on fine objects in muse- ums," said Getty antiquities curator Marion True. "By providing fieldwork opportunities and a deeper understand- ing of the materials from which objects are made the program will raise the stan- dard of work undertaken in the field and ensure that evidence from the past sur- vives." The degree will be conferred by UCLA. -AMHS www.archaeology.org 31</page><page sequence="14">Egyptian Gold Rush A2r900-year-old led untapped to as much gold in papyrus as Egypt's $16 billion map Eastern has in A2r900-year-old led to as much as $16 billion in untapped gold in Egypt's Eastern Desert, between Luxor and Aswan and the Red Sea. "Modern technology will help make [mining] the uneconomical low-grade deposits of the pharaohs vi- able," says Sami El-Raghy, an executive with Centamin Egypt Ltd., the company that hopes to exploit the deposits. According to a report carried by the Wall Street Journal in February, the Egyptian government has given Centa- min title to 5,000 ¿quare miles of the Eastern Desert. The company became aware of the region s potential by study- ing the map, found at Luxor in 1820 and now in a museum in Turin, Italy, which shows the locations of pharaonic mines. Sixteen have beèn identified, but the map indicates there may be as many as 104 others. Centamin began repro- cessing the debris left by ancient miners at the Sukari mine in 1997. More than 153,000 ounces of gold have been re- covered there. Initial estimates suggest- ed there may be 2.1 million ounces at Sukari, but it is now thought that there may be as many as 10 million ounces worth about $2.98 billion. In Centa- min s 1998 annual report, chairman Ro- land Bocso described Sukari as "one of the prime gold projects on the worlds mining scene." At a conference in Cape Town this February, El-Raghy said that the entire Eastern Desert may hold 55 million ounces ($16.39 billion). The Wall Street Journal article noted that "ancient workings pepper the area" at Sukari but makes no mention of any efforts to record them. Responding to Archaeology's inquiry about protecting sites at Sukari and elsewhere in the Eastern Desert, El-Raghy said, "As a mining executive I'm very much aware of the current and future heritage value of the archaeological sites. As an Egyp- tian, Im even more aware and proud of this rich history. My exploration crews. . . are instructed to record any site they come across. We intend to take into ac- count the preservation of all sites in our development plans." -MR 32 Archaeology, May/June 1999</page></plain_text>
