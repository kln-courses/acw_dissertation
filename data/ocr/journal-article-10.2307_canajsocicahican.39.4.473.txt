From it, by successive trans- formations, have come all the other manifestations of collective activity:  law, ethics, art, science, political forms, and so on. Everything is religious  in principle (Durkheim [orig. 1897] 1978: 123). 1. Inevitably, when one reads texts from a different era, s/he encounters the  spirit and writing conventions of that era. We wish to acknowledge that  Durkheim’s books and articles were written in an era in which gender neu- tral language was neither used, nor widely regarded as significant. Today, by  contrast, gender inclusive language within the human sciences is a rightly  established social fact. To avoid the risks of mistranslation through modern- ization, we have decided to retain the terminology from all original texts and  translations throughout this volume. © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(4) 2014 473 </page> <page sequence="2"> 474 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(4) 2014 A religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred  things, that is to say, things set apart and forbidden—beliefs and practices  which unite into a single moral community called a Church, all those who  adhere to them (original emphasis; Durkheim 1995 [1912]: 44, i.e., The  Elementary Forms of Religious Life/ Les formes élémentaires de la vie  religieuse, hereafter abbreviated as EFRL or shortened to The Forms). The focus of this special issue for the Canadian Journal of Sociology is Émile Durkheim’s book, The Elementary Forms of Religious Life  and contemporary engagements with it. In honour of its centenary,  we bring together ten original contributions joined by their shared en- gagement with Durkheim’s powerful text. This collection can be read as  a living manifestation of the contemporary relevance of The Forms, a  testament to its capacity to elicit new questions about the nature of social  reality, elucidate the social forces animating forms of collectivization,  and stimulate creative directions within contemporary social theory.  In The Forms, his arguably greatest work, Durkheim explicates the  elemental social basis of religion to uncover its ultimate foundation in  the “real,” declaring from the outset that “there are no religions that are  false” (EFRL: 2).2 Religion for Durkheim emerges from the substratum  of the social since what the collectivity values “is the source of all re- ligious experience” (cf. EFRL: 274; Milbrandt and Pearce 2011: 269,  270). Broadly defined as a system of obligatory beliefs and practices  relative to sacred things, religion is no mere epiphenomena; rather, it is  a necessary and constitutive element of all viable collectivities (EFRL:  429), from the White Cockatoo clan of pre-modern Australian totemism  to contemporary Canadian society. Today, we extend this to the globe, as  witnessed by such things as the collective effervescence of World Cup  football, communicated by the collective representation of the “buzz”of  vuvuzelas emanating from televisions around the world, transcend- ing and linking societies together in a vibrant cosmopolitanism “from  2. As Fields points out, the French word “élémentaires” can be translated as  either “elementary” or as “elemental.” “Elemental” serves to remind the  reader that “Durkheim is interested in “a fundamental and permanent” as- pect of humanity and its “ever-present source,” which can be discerned if  studies in what he take to be its elemental forms. Whatever those forms are  [...] they have an underlying identity that persists despite unceasing change  and limitless diversity” (1995: lix–lx). An additional exemplar of this method  is found in Durkheim’s lectures on socialism (1962) in which he examines  all the varieties of socialism to distill what they have in common. Mauss  described Durkheim’s explication of his approach to socialism “as a model  of the application of sociological and historical method to the analysis of the  causes of an idea” (1962: 34). </page> <page sequence="3"> EFRL: diSCurSive MonuMent, SyMboliC feaSt               475 below” (Datta 2012: 531; Turner 2006a; Inglis 2011; Inglis and Robert- son 2008). This collection was itself conceived in the aftermath of an effer- vescent conversation, about how Durkheim’s last major text warrants  new engagement and re-examination, especially in light of contempo- rary theoretical developments and socio-cultural formations inviting  Durkheimian analysis or intervention. In this introduction, we discuss  the features of the enduring impact of The Forms and offer a brief  overview of the book. We invite the reader to apprehend The Forms  as a discursive monument, one that occupies a strikingly nodal place  within the discursive networks of the social sciences. As a discursive  monument, The Forms has been “left by the past” (Foucault 1972: 7)  and yet it stands. Its production is a singular “event” (Foucault 1972:  8) affecting the human sciences as a monumental work in many major  theoretical traditions both positively and negatively. The Forms can also  be taken up as part of a symbolic feast of social analysis, nourishing a  range of interpretive approaches. This circumstance, we are pleased to  say, is evinced by the range of contributors’ work here. Most significant- ly, they are reminders of the salience of the questions Durkheim posed  concerning the very constitution of social life (cf. Milbrandt and Pearce  2011; Ramp 2010; Datta 2008). The analytical and explanatory power of the concepts in The Forms  makes it possible to extend Durkheim’s conception of how collective  power is symbolised in enduring, existentially meaningful, consecrated,  totem-like forms beyond his immediate empirical referent of central  Australian tribes. The concept of the sacred can be applied to a wide  range of phenomena, from the rather ordinary ritual and meaning of don- ning one’s “Sunday best,” to extraordinary global social facts such as the  revolutionary collective effervescence witnessed in Eastern Europe in  1989 (Tiryakian 1995). Many recent theoretical developments, notably  heterogeneous, build upon The Forms. These include Jeffrey C. Alexan- der’s sociological conception of justice developed in The Civil Sphere  (2006) and Julia Kristeva’s psychoanalysis of revolution in Revolt, She  Said (2002), among many others. The Forms also functions as an on-go- ing foil for Giorgio Agamben’s influential genealogy of politics, religion  and economics (2009). Although The Forms has been read for over a century, 2015 marks the  twentieth anniversary of the publication of Karen E. Fields’ translation  of the book into modern English, together with corrections to footnotes,  references and maps (Fields 1995: lii). Fields’ translation and introduc- tion both consolidated and opened up a new era in Durkheimian studies.  Indeed, her stated hope was to facilitate new readings and study of The  </page> <page sequence="4"> 476 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(4) 2014 Forms both within and beyond sociology and anthropology (xxiii). Her  work has been invaluable to our own. The reliance of English-language  Durkheimian studies on her translation, including the bulk of the contri- butions below, is indicative that Fields’ hope has become reality.  There are several features of this project. First, the spirit of the col- lection is one of creatively appropriating Durkheim’s work to develop  novel lines of sociological inquiry, even in cases where what is creative- ly developed arises from critiques of The Forms. This is significant as it  highlights the extent to which generations of justified criticisms of Durk- heim’s work have not led to its abandonment.3 This suggests that what is  enduring about Durkheim’s book is its theoretical visuality (López 2003;  Woodiwiss 2005), its method of rendering realities of human life empiric- ally apprehensible within the order of social scientific discourse, despite  contradictions and aporias in the text. Second, we draw attention to the  disarticulation of the sacred-profane distinction from “religion” proper.  For Durkheim, as for the contributors in this issue, sacred and profane  powers can be found quite outside the domain of formal religious institu- tions, from highly charged occasions to the most troubling domains of  social life. Third, we note the optimism about social life that Durkheim’s  sociology offers. In contrast to the rather unquestioned tendency in much  contemporary critical social science to view morality with suspicion, the  cultivation of strong and affective social bonds can be regarded as a posi- tive basis of collective life, as a “good thing” and condition of existence  for human flourishing. Morality can guide humane and democratic judg- ments; it need not be viewed as a social fact to be a priori denounced as  inherently complicit in a dubious status quo. One of the major lessons of  Durkheimian sociology, after all, is that healthy manifestations of social  life are an ontological foundation (an elementary potentiality) to be dif- ferently leveraged to enhance the conditions of human flourishing (cf.  Watts Miller 2012; Pearce 2001; Datta 2010).  Contextualizing durkheiM’S intervention The theoretical and practical reference points for Durkheim’s sociologic- al programme are explicitly the French Revolution, the unfulfilled prom- ise of the First Republic and the abnormal form in which French society  in particular, and Western European society in general, developed. This  inhumane and unjust development was signified by class warfare, wide- 3.

These conditions impeded the  necessary development of plural bases of a democratic-communicative  infrastructure necessary to adequate conscientious considerations of so- cial justice, i.e., a concern with the well-being of society as a whole,  which would require the full inclusion of all social groups. In a word, the  most advanced, complex societies were “anomic.” The human sciences, Durkheim’s included, sought to address the  real impacts of the industrial and French revolutions (cf. Foucault  1994: 345). The privileging of state-facilitated industrial and economic  growth characteristic of Louis Napoleon’s French Second Empire had  led to abnormalities in the division of social labour, the unequal allo- cation of socially necessary resources, and serious social pathologies  causing human suffering. The France of Durkheim’s day, the Third Re- public (1870–1940), while full of promise, was in a precarious state.  The German defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871)  challenged nationalist grandiosity. This was accompanied by divisive  ideological debates between liberals, socialists, conservatives, and cler- ics concerning the direction France should take (Milbrandt and Pearce  2011, 240–242). The brutal, murderous crushing of the Paris Commune  in 1871 by the state served as a chilling caution to revolutionary idealists  (Stedman Jones 2010; Ramp, this volume). Durkheim sought practical,  viable and desirable sociologically derived solutions to these serious  problems. A central task for a healthy and normal modern state form  was to attend to the facilitation and celebration of “moral individualism”  in all facets of society for all persons (Durkheim 1973). For Durkheim,  broadened democratic politics was a means to the end of empowering  people to be able to experience the benefits of collective life, endure tra- gedies because of social support, and facilitate creativity and flourishing. In Durkheim’s own lifetime, a belief in the potential for a more hu- mane, pluralistic and substantively egalitarian society recalled the cre- ative collective effervescence of the French Revolution (EFRL: 213,  430). Today, we witness a rekindling of transformative democratic and  socialist ideals against conditions that can be understood to violate a  modern society’s “need of justice” (Durkheim 1984 [1893]: 322; Pearce  2001: 71–83). This can be seen through coordinated and effervescent  manifestations against authoritative regimes (the “Arab Spring”), chal- lenges to neo-liberal attacks against workers (“Occupy” and “anti-aus- terity” movements), and movements directed against colonial legacies  (e.g., the indigenous peoples’ “Idle No More” movement in Canada).  Crystallized collective representations expressing ritualistic street mani- </page> <page sequence="6"> 478 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(4) 2014 festations (e.g. “We are the 99%!”) and transnational expressions of soli- darity can be read as signs of an increasingly integrated, albeit highly  uneven, international society. Energized by intolerance for injustice,  such movements are suggestive of a shared conviction in the ideals of a  just society that transcends individual nations (Durkheim 1984 [1893]:  322). Such movements  seem to us consistent with Durkheim’s concep- tion of the (sacred) ideals that modern society arouses within the souls,  or consciences, of its members.4  Collective movements and political  formations organized against exclusionary practices and divisive politics  can thus be understood as indicating that the moral needs and ethos of an  increasingly differentiated global society have been transgressed, sup- pressing the development of genuinely organic, cosmopolitan solidarity. Social Institutions and The Forms The discursive reach of The Forms across the human sciences can, in  part, be accounted for by the range of social institutions and phenomena  that Durkheim sought to describe, analyse and explain. The research pro- grammes of the Durkheimian team centred around the publication of the  journal L’Année Sociologique are indicative of the range of social facts  under consideration, with the study of religion afforded a privileged  place. When the journal was founded in 1896, a section of reviews  was reserved for the Sociology of Religion, among General Sociology,  Juridic and Moral Sociology, Criminal Sociology (and Moral Statistics  in Volume 4), Economic Sociology and Miscellaneous, (dealing with el- ements of social morphology for instance) (Fournier 2013: 276).  The central focus in The Forms is Durkheim’s account of the consti- tutive components from which the social institution of religion is com- posed. It is important to note that for Durkheim “religion” is a sociologi- cal concept referring to one among several major social institutions in  complex societies (e.g., law, morality, the family, work, the state, etc).  Durkheim, in 1909, while explicating the central logic of his sociology  and making a case for the essential role of the comparative-historical  method in sociology, lays out the contours of institutional analysis as  follows: The principal problems of sociology consist in researching the way in  4. The French word “conscience” means both “consciousness” and “con- science”; here we use the French word. Durkheim exploited both of these  senses in his use of the word conscience using it to refer both to the con- science individuel (the consciousness and conscience of individual persons)  and to the conscience collective (the consciousness and conscience of a soci- ety as carried and sustained by collective representations especially). </page> <page sequence="7"> EFRL: diSCurSive MonuMent, SyMboliC feaSt               479 which a political, a legal, moral, economic, or religious institution, belief  and so on, was established, what causes gave rise to it, and to what use- ful ends it responds. [...] In effect, to understand an institution, one must  know of what it is made. It is a complex whole, comprised of parts; one  must know these parts and be able to explain each of them separately as  well as the way in which they are combined (Durkheim 1978: 82–3). Durkheim’s methodological reasoning is instructive as concerns his con- ception of sociology as a science of institutions and how institutions con- tingently combine to constitute a society because with Australian totem- ism, the institution of totemism and society are one and the same. Thus,  to describe, analyse and explain totemism as the elemental form of reli- gion is at the same to time to describe, analyse and explain the elemental  form of institutions. Further, the simplicity of the Australian case makes  it possible to describe, analyse and explain the constitution of a society.  This works in the case of Australian totemism because the institution is  totalising, enframing all facets of human-social existence. The Forms and Durkheim’s Sociological Problematic The Forms consolidates work on two concepts central to Durkheim’s  entire sociological programme: solidarity and collective representations.  These concepts are markers of what we take to be Durkheim’s funda- mental theoretical problematic, namely, the conditions of possibility of  social life. Solidarity is a concept designed to explain the kind of force  working in and through individual persons, an essentially moral force  compelling them from within to act in the interests of others, even when  they do not feel so inclined and may prefer to act egoistically (Durkheim  1984 [1893]). Solidarity refers to people’s sense of social attachment,  their capacity to satisfy moral obligations share concerns and respon- sibilities in common with others, all of which are necessary to societal  integration (Watts Miller 2012: 37ff.) Durkheim’s scientific revolution was to have found epistemological  means for opening the continent of a science of morals, including moral  feelings/sentiments, without the aprioristic romantic baggage of suppos- ing that people are born “good.” Collective representations like totems,  language, the calendar, a flag, currents of public opinion, ideals such  as freedom and equality, or monetary currency, to name but a handful,  are external carriers and markers of solidarity. As such they are “social  facts,” external to any particular individual or group; they cannot be  changed through an individual act of will, and are thus coercive upon  individuals’ egoistic inclinations. Social facts are regulative of people’s  actions, obliging members to honor socially instituted ways or face sanc- </page> <page sequence="8"> 480 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(4) 2014 tions, whether these take the form of ridicule, (e.g. if one commits a  “fashion crime” [cf. Durkheim 1982: 51]), derision, or formal punish- ments meted out by the state. They are also typically general or per- vasive throughout a society. Collective representations are a repository  of frameworks for thought, communication and social action that have  become crystallized, facilitating coordinated life with others, and pre- scribing “ways of acting, thinking and feeling” (1982: 52). While we  highlight the significance of collective representations, it is important  to emphasize that Durkheim rejected a purely cognitivist sociology. In  The Forms in particular, he illustrates the importance of enacted social  practice in the creation, renewal, and transformation of collective rep- resentations. This is highlighted by Anne Warfield Rawls (2001; 2012)  whose work draws attention to the ethnomethodological reading of what  Garfinkel called “Durkheim’s neglected legacy” (Garfinkel 2002: 94). SuMMary of ThE ELEmEnTaRy FoRms oF RELigious LiFE While there is no substitute for reading Durkheim’s text itself, prefer- ably in English and French, here we offer a predominantly paraphrased  summary of lines of reasoning and central concepts in The Forms, about  what we have found incisive in the book.5 Of course, an overview of this  sort reflects our own editorial choices and admittedly may be seen as  unnecessarily “scholastic.” Our hope though, is to provide a guide for  continuing to engage with the contributions in this volume and with The  Forms, portraying what we take to be a discursive survey of Durkheim’s  ambitious project as a whole. The original subtitle of the book is “Totemism in Australia” indicat- ing the primary empirical referent for the development of Durkheim’s  position (Fournier 2013: 603). The book is organized by an introduction,  attention to seminal questions, two major sections, the first dealing with  beliefs (Book II), the second with rituals (Book III), and a conclusion  distilling key points. The primary aim is to analyse elemental component  parts (5) in the simplest example of religion known, and explain how the  parts combine to produce an enduring, institutionalised form of moral  community. In turn, this constitutes the conditions of possibility of soci- ety itself and the resultant collective human capacity for reasoned moral  reflection, judgment and understanding (Stedman Jones 2001). The data  were especially drawn, if imaginatively (Watts Miller 2012: 151ff.),  5.

Relying on,  J. S. Mills’ argument that explaining a single case in methodologically  rigorous form is sufficient to establish a theory (418, cf. 92), Durkheim  sought to conduct a sociological analysis in which all religions, primitive  and modern are discussed “on equal terms” (Fournier 2013: 605; cf. Ros- ati 2008), thus distinguishing his work from that of Lucien Lévy-Bruhl  (cf. Tiryakian 2012). Finding the simplest case was important given the  historical development of complex societies with their wide variations  of religious beliefs, practices and syncretic combinations (5). Durkheim  resolves this problem with his usual method of seeking to identify ele- ments common in all instances of a belief system, restricting himself  to developing a definition amenable to a positive science of religion,  i.e., one that can be based on (but not reducible to) observation and de- pendent on analysis, breaking the phenomenon down into its most basic  components. Durkheim announces the result of his work in his introduction, argu- ing for the social origin of religion, encapsulating collective life in shared  symbols that in turn guide ritual practices that sustain and renew the  group (9). Stressing his ambition early on, he advances an argument that  the basic conceptual framework of human life, involving conceptions of  time, space, genus, force, personality and their active, communal com- bination in the work of reason, is fundamentally social in origin (10-18). True to his “scientific rationalism” (Durkheim 1982: 33; Stedman  Jones 2001; Gane 1988), Durkheim begins by providing a definition of  religion. Because researchers inevitably bring preconceptions to their  studies, it is preferable to develop and reflect systematically on how vari- ous preconceptions are likely to shape the development of a scientific  research programme, rather than risk relying on intuitions or unexam- ined preconceptions. He dispenses with influential theories of religion  including those stressing that religions arise as a means to deal with what  people find mysterious since the beliefs in sacred beings tend to facili- tate the routine workings of social life and are certainly not reserved for  things deemed inexplicable (26). Neither can religion be understood as  being based on a belief in divinity since there are religions that do not  depend on a belief in a god; Buddhism is a prime example. Durkheim,  largely following his earlier piece from 1899, “Concerning the definition  of religious phenomena” (1994a), advances a “positive” definition of re- ligion stressing that belief systems and obligatory ritual actions are fun- damental to religion (34). However, in contrast to his earlier definition,  he now emphasizes the sacred and its distinctiveness from the profane. </page> <page sequence="10"> 482 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(4) 2014 Religious beliefs and rites pertain to two different classifications of  real and ideal things designated by the Latin-based categories of “the  profane and the sacred” (34). Because the sacred depends on the social  practices of sanctified persons like priests, any part of human reality can  become sacred, depending on whether it is treated in special, ritualized  ways (35). This also implies that sacrality cannot be derived from how  humans experience nature. Rather, it derives from what fundamentally  pertains to collective life and is radically differentiated from profane  existence with its individualistic orientations and interests i.e., “ego- ism”, especially those associated with utilitarian and economic matters.  This difference between the sacred and profane is substantial, dealing  in markedly different realities affecting human existence in radically  heterogeneous ways (36). Profane life is deemed subordinate to the  sacred realm and dependent on it. Religious beliefs and the rites guided  by them specify how communication and movement between the sacred  and profane spheres is to be conducted. Male initiation rites are a prime  example of this because they radically transform a boy for entry into  adult religious life and full communal membership. Initiation amounts to  a series of practices of cleansing the boy of his profanity and subjugating  it. In short, the sacred and profane refer to two fundamentally differ- ent, opposed, but intimately connected worlds. Religions are constituted  when a system for coordinating and ordering sacred things has been es- tablished (38). In contrast, magic is derivative of, and distinct from religion, even  while containing beliefs and rites, because magic is rather about the use  of technical knowledge to achieve the utilitarian end of a person seeking  the services of a magician. Magic is thus more like doing business than  like religion. Unlike religion it has no need of bonds of mutual obliga- tion or an institutionalized collective like a church to sustain them (42).  Durkheim concludes this section with his definition of religion (quoted  in full at the start of our Introduction). The remainder of the book mounts  a comprehensive defence and explication of the theorem. Using his standard rhetorical device of criticising predominant theor- ies of the day to make his own seem more plausible, Durkheim challen- ges animism and naturism. The animistic theory influentially advocated  by Edward Tylor contends that religious beliefs stem from the difference  between wakeful and dream states in people. In dreaming, people experi- ence their soul and the souls of the dead. For Tylor, death liberates the  soul from the body to become a spirit that still affects the lives of the  living, serving as the basis for the development of religious ideas. Natur- ism, exemplified within Max Muller’s work, holds that religion emerges  from imaginative solutions for explaining natural phenomena like light- </page> <page sequence="11"> EFRL: diSCurSive MonuMent, SyMboliC feaSt               483 ning. People come to believe that such forces are manifestations of a per- sonified spiritual entity and thus are born the gods. Naturism, however,  does not have a way to explain the radical difference between sacred and  profane things, especially the awe and respect that are part and parcel  of religious feelings, ones that frequently are attached to natural things  people routinely encounter being treated as sacred in totemic religions.  Naturism thus cannot explain the emergence of something super-natural  (83–84). The difference between the sacred and the profane lacked an  adequate explanation. Durkheim postulates that ethnographic descriptions of totemism pro- vide evidence of the earliest form of religion. Totemic religions, as found  in Australia and North America, reflect the social basis of the elementary  distinction between the sacred and profane not least since the totem plant  or animal also constitutes the basis of societal organization, the latter  implying the formation of a moral community (93). Durkheim focuses  on the Australian case of the Arunta in particular because North Amer- ican cases involve more advanced and complex forms of social organisa- tion, indicating that they have gone some distance from their origins and  hence are no longer elementary (93-94). Book II addresses the elemental beliefs of Australian totemism as  an emergent system, grounding them in an analysis of clans as the basic  grouping of collective life. Clans bind individuals in kinship, that bond  being represented by the name of a totem, whether a plant or animal  species (103). Clans exist within a tribe and in inter-tribal relations. The  totem name is what distinguishes a clan as a group from other groups,  individuals, things and places that do not belong to the clan. The emblem  is thus a marker of membership, symbolising what is exclusive to the  group (181). Australian tribes consist of two phratries each consisting  of several clans. Members of a phratry are obliged to practice exogamy  (marrying outside of the group). Members of the clan are also bound by  a system of obligations that concern helping each other, mourning and  joining forces to fight enemies. This system for organizing social life is united by the dominance of  the totem as emblem, providing the means for designating to whom obli- gations and rules apply. Totemism is thus both a system of knowledge,  facilitating classification of what belongs where, and a system of obliga- tions pertaining to moral life. However, the totem is more than a name; it  is rather a powerful symbol of the collective (111) and is above all “writ- ten” (Gane 1983; cf. Masuzawa 1988), whether traced on the ground at a  burial site (113) people’s dwellings, or things used in daily life (114). It is  on the body itself that the totemic symbol is frequently written as found  with tattooing (116), or when painted on a newly initiated person upon  </page> <page sequence="12"> 484 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(4) 2014 first entry into a sanctuary (117). To take a contemporary example, the  rainbow flag, ubiquitous during LGBTQ pride marches and designated  “pride” times in cities around the world, offers a vivid example of the  group emblem as powerful “rallying sign” that symbolizes, affirms, and  reconstitutes the group (local and transnational) to and for itself. Partici- pants adorn their clothing with this emblem, paint it on their faces and  bodies, and wave it in the air during ritualistic street parades.  A recurring example of sacred ritual objects in The Forms are chur- ingas. These objects have the totemic mark of the group and great care is  taken to look after them (118). They are the holiest of objects, set apart  and forbidden to women and the uninitiated (119). They are kept in a  hidden sacred place, separated from profane daily life, constituting that  place as the holiest of holy places. Because holy places are protected by  collectively imposed interdictions, they can also be used as places of  refuge (120). By analysing the uses of totemic markings, Durkheim argues for a  homology between the totemic emblem and religious life because to- temic emblems have a predominantly ritual use in collective ceremonies.  Thus while it is a collective label, the totem is also a profoundly religious  thing (118). Durkheim here follows a methodological principle of using  the description of setting apart and forbidding by the community to argue  that totemism is indeed an elementary religion precisely because it has a  system for sacral differentiation. The sacred character of the totem mark  (124) emerges from the power of the clan being signified in material  form — it is the totemic symbol itself that is sacred, not the material  objects or bodies on which it is written (133). Totemic emblems as collective representations of the group, together  with the system of social organisation, result in cosmologies constitut- ing the first form of a genus necessary to operations of logic (148). The  logical hierarchy of the terms genus and species in which a species be- longs to a genus, stems from totemic cosmologies in which the collective  totem takes primacy over individual totems, the former constituted by  rituals pertaining to the group and the latter given to individuals at birth  to designate their specific place in the group (179). Durkheim’s explication of totemism as inextricably linked to social  organisation is also elaborated in terms of a totem belonging to an indi- vidual, and totems dividing the tribe into two sexes: male and female.  An individual totem is tied to the name of an individual and is associated  with an object that is the sacred property of that individual. This name  is sacred and is not used in everyday life (159). The individual totem  is generally worn or tattooed. In the case of individual animal totems  functioning as patrons to persons, the characteristics, virtues and vices  </page> <page sequence="13"> EFRL: diSCurSive MonuMent, SyMboliC feaSt               485 imputed to the animal are deemed to be shared with the human in a  kind of similitude (160). Examples of the relationship between humans  and animals in contemporary mythological representations include a  “familiar” attached to a witch (e.g. a black cat or a goat) or Voldemort’s  snake Nagini in the Harry Potter series. While the individual animal to- tem is a patron, the human has power over the animal (161). The cult of  the individual totem emphasizes the on-going ties between individuals  and the materials of daily life (162). Whereas an individual in a clan is  seen as offspring of the clan’s totem, in the case of the individual totem,  that relation is more like one of friendship (162). The totem of the clan  provides a collectively protected identity for all members (163) and is  combined with the individual totem to constitute something akin to a  surname and a sacred first name designating the specific place and pow- ers of an individual within the clan. Sexual totems refer to a tribal totemic system differentiating between  the sexes, inclusive of all men and women in all clans of the tribe. The  sexual totems constitute two rivalrous groups (167) with ties to respect- ive mystical, protector, sacred animals from which all are deemed to  have descended (167). Like the clan, sexual totems are also collective  (167). The tribe itself is believed to be the spawn of a mythical pair of  ancestors. The sacredness of each sexual totem must be respected by  both sexes and they live the bulk of their collective lives segregated from  each other (168). There is thus a continuum of totems with individual  totems on one end, then sexual totems in the middle, and tribal totems  at the other.  With a cosmology derived from the totemic system, all people,  things, places, etc., that are part of clan life are seen to depend on, and be  suffused with, a totemic principle because it is an impersonal, imman- ent life-force. The basis of religious belief systems is thus exemplified  in ideas of such impersonal, pervasive forces like those evinced by the  Melanesian notion of mana (202). These forces do more than take nature  as their referent; they also refer to people’s sense of obligatory conduct,  impacting morals — aboriginals faithfully and rigorously practice rites  because their exemplary ancestors did so (192). In short, the totemic  principle unites the totality and workings of the cosmos, encompassing  both nature and social life. Durkheim concludes Book II with three famous theoretical develop- ments. The first is the rough equation of “totem = god = society” (cf.  Lacroix 1979; Pickering 1984: 231–235; Fields 1995: xxxv–xxxviii), the  second his concept of “collective effervescence,” and the third a theory  of the soul, of spirits and “high gods.” Concerning the first theoretical  development, “Durkheim’s theory is extremely forceful: he considers  </page> <page sequence="14"> 486 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(4) 2014 gods as a symbolic form through which men [sic] can worship collective  life, though he never makes a pure and simple identification of God and  society” (Rosati 2008: 242). For Durkheim totems are highly emotion- ally charged symbolic expressions of the belief in the totem principle, a  belief in something like divine omnipotence. As he states, the totem “is  the outward and visible form of what I have called the totemic principle  or god; from another, it is also the symbol of a particular society called  the clan. It is the flag of the clan” (208). Durkheim’s reasoning also sug- gests, however, that religion with its gods is really a misrecognition of  society and its power because the totemic principle is imaginatively  transformed by synthesizing a belief in the totemic principle with the  natural substrate of a specific animal or plant species (208); something  else emerges from this combination irreducible to the properties of its  constituent elements. Hence, the “equation” of god and society is not  simple. The misrecognition is likely both constitutive of religion and  inescapable given how, in Durkheim’s view, humans synthesize con- sciousness of matter in sensations, sensations themselves immediately  being synthesized with collective representations to form individuals’  perceptions, the world that spontaneously “makes sense”  to people (cf.  Stedman Jones 2001; Lacroix 1979; Strawbridge 1982). How people experience religious powers is homologous with their  experience of the power of society. The source of all power, includ- ing that of authoritative individuals, is society (210, 215; Pearce 2001:  33–38; Lacroix 1979), and to experience the sacred is to frequently be  empowered by communion with it. Divine power and authority is not  simply an external coercive force but one that can empower the believer  (211; cf. 419). One’s god has the power to fundamentally change oneself  as one might find with conversion experiences. Indeed, collective power  can be radically transformative, as found for instance during the French  Revolution in which otherwise ordinary persons acted heroically or even  murderously (213). A specific kind of event generates an experience originative of this  system of beliefs about power, namely “collective effervescence.” Echo- ing Mauss’ (1979) study of the oscillations of social life among the  peoples of the Arctic, Durkheim notes that social life in Australian tribes  alternates between two phases: a less social, economically-oriented,  rather dull, and routine period pertinent to subsistence, and a second  period like corroboree, an electrifying, emotionally intense, physically  engaging gathering including all members, even the uninitiated (217).  Being in proximity with others itself energises participants. Encouraged  by seeing and feeling others behaving outlandishly, transgressing routine  expectations about appropriate conduct, and breaking out spontaneously  </page> <page sequence="15"> EFRL: diSCurSive MonuMent, SyMboliC feaSt               487 in music and dance (218), it becomes a moment of shared extreme emo- tion and movement. To use a Nietzschean turn of phrase this is an ex- perience “beyond good and evil” when the laws and morals pertaining  to routine social life are suspended, much as they are for the gods as  depicted in Greek mythology — it is a state in which the “exception”  is the “rule” (Datta 2010). People’s experience of the radically different  power of the collective, generative of a belief in the power of the sacred,  is produced on such occasions. This social force is ecstatic (228; from the Greek, “ekstasis”) in  which people “stand” (stasis) “out of” (ek-) their usual placement in the  order of tribe, phratry, clan and routine activities associated with daily  life. The spatial organisation of the sacred (e.g., temples and sanctuar- ies) thus finds its origin in temporality, in the collectively effervescent  event (Datta 2010: 177). Collective effervescence generates a unique  force constitutive of moral life, empowering people with the capacity to  transcend egoistic, individualistic orientations, concerns and practices  characteristic of profane life. It does so by giving people an experience  of acting very differently than they usually do, with the group being the  referent of that action. The powerful, overwhelming feelings experienced in collective ef- fervescence are transferred to the totem animal or plant by a sort of con- tagion to endure as a revered symbol to which people are passionately  attached (232). It is in this respect that the effervescent assembly is cre- ative (Pickering 1984, 386), generating a new contingent assemblage of  “words and things” (Datta 2008: 292). This also how “creative collective  effervescence” as found during the French Revolution can be revolu- tionary without being destructive (Stedman Jones 2001: 213). The totem  symbol functions as a mnemonic device of the ecstatic occasion (222),  becoming a highly crystallised collective representation of the power  of the social (a social fact), and an elemental condition of possibility  of social life (225). The totem symbol becomes a generalized existen- tial referent for epistemic, ontologic, affective, normative and aesthetic  judgments. Things deemed sacred become so by the application of the  collective representation of the totem emblem to them, providing a con- duit for an on-going communication of the idea and experience of social/ sacred energy onto things so marked (231; cf. 424), superimposing them  on nature (230; cf. 424). The final section dealing with the elementary beliefs of religious life  explicates how the notion of soul provides the basis from which ideas  about spirits and finally tribal gods emerge. Durkheim’s theory of the  soul attends to the social constitution of personhood and subject forma- tion. Individuals are constituted through a synthesis of their body and a  </page> <page sequence="16"> 488 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(4) 2014 soul that individualizes the life of the totem principle for a person, en- suring the group’s perpetuity in that person (263–267). The soul, while  closely bound to the body, nevertheless has an independence from it and  lives after death. Funeral rites typically involve means to encourage the  soul to leave the body (246) and go to its own specific world, something  akin to heaven (247–248). Durkheim argues that the soul is part of the  totem principle embodied in individuals (251). Because each empirical,  physical individual has its own consciousness, each soul is different  (251). Durkheim links the soul to its collective origin by noting that it  contains one’s highest self and the basis of one’s moral consciousness  (251–2). For Durkheim then, the conventional, typically liberal, theor- etical opposition between the individual and society is misleading; the  individual soul depends on the collective soul and the life combining the  collective continues in the lives of its individual members (252, 269). The totemic being is believed to be the soul of an ancestor that con- tinues to be bound to individuals through churingas (258). The origin  of the tribe is believed to have stemmed from various ancestors (259).  An overlapping socio-logic of totemic principle, ancestors, and souls al- lows Durkheim to point to the sacredness of the soul, containing a divine  spark, whereas the body is associated with the profane (265), not least  since the body individualizes consciousness via the senses (275) form- ing a physical substratum to the social constitution of subjectivity and  personhood (274). The social source of the soul gives it a reality outside  the minds of subjects (265) because it comes to the individual from the  external social world, originating from the shared idea of a totemic prin- ciple like mana (252). This lends moral force to the soul, constituting  people’s capacities as moral agents (266). The double constitution of  human subjects emerges from the articulated combination of the domin- ance of the soul (266) with its collective origin associated with the totem  principle, residing in and guiding the body-profane (273). One might  be tempted to call this something like the “social DNA” of the popula- tion (e.g., “A love of hockey is in our collective DNA.”) The soul is the  agency making it possible for people to transcend merely egoistic and/ or animalistic inclinations. Souls are believed to have the power to make  other souls, providing for the enduring existence of the life of the group  that transcends the lives of any of its individual members (272). While the collective soul is impersonal and a property possessed by  all members of the group, an individual soul is personal reflecting a syn- thesis of the distinct empirical embodied locations of each individual  and the unique perspective arising from this. Individuals thus are able to  appropriate the sacred in their own way making it meaningful to them  in their specific circumstances (273; cf. Durkheim 1982: 47 n6). Hence  </page> <page sequence="17"> EFRL: diSCurSive MonuMent, SyMboliC feaSt               489 Durkheim anticipates Foucault’s theorem that “the soul is the prison of  the body” (Foucault 1979: 30); for Durkheim, the soul personalises the  power of the social enabling people to regulate their desires (275; Fields  1995: xxix). Having linked the substance of the soul to the enduring life of the  group, Durkheim develops his analysis to account for the ideas of spirits  and gods. While the soul is intricately linked to the body, spirits are not  so tied to the body and are able to move about (276). A ghost is not a spir- it because lacking obligations to the group, whereas spirits have power,  authority and are responsible for doing things in the world (277–281).  Spirits are typically beneficent but a belief in malevolent spirits (286)  emerged to explain human miseries (284). Spirits mark the further “indi- viduation of religious forces” (286). Totemism as an elemental system of  religious beliefs thus provides means for understanding how individual  souls that personalize the totemic principle become privileged ancestor  spirits that subjugate others to become high gods (299). The institution of the tribe and its subdivisions (286) is central to the  development of a notion of gods believed to be highly valorized totemic  beings, specifically, mythologized ancestors (293-294). The rites of the  tribe, especially those of initiation, pertain to all subdivisions and are  practiced in the same way. Initiation is a tribal ritual in which the cult  of a high god like Altjira, is celebrated (291). Tribal high gods represent  the tribe to other neighbouring tribes and hence exist in an international  context (292). The notion of a high god seems to have emerged from the notion  of “civilizing heroes,” special ancestors deemed to have been key to  the development of the tribe (294). A civilizing hero is so because he  is believed to have inaugurated the basis of central social practices and  institutions like religion (294). High gods, closely related to civilizing  heroes, are fundamentally totemic in nature. Legends indicate that high  gods emerge from hostilities between totems. Durkheim argues that the  high god of the tribe is the representation of the spirit of an ancestor, an  ancestor that defeated others (299).The ascendance of one high god (to- temic being) is deemed to morally justify the exclusion of the vanquished  and their subjugation to the dominance of the victor (296). High gods are  especially celebrated for their creative power of being able to reconsti- tute boys as men during initiation rites. The high god’s governance of  initiation demonstrates their dominance over all persons in the tribe and  hence too, pointing to something “universal” for all tribe members. In  short, the high god combines all of the totems to represent a supreme to- tality (298). An international mythology emerges as a consequence of the  international (inter-tribal) recognition of gods and exchanges between  </page> <page sequence="18"> 490 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(4) 2014 tribes (298). With his analysis of elementary beliefs, Durkheim aims to  link the empirical body, individual and collective representations, the  social constitution of the person, the combination of subgroups (e.g.,  clans) and the tribal totality. The belief in the totemic principle, itself  emergent from the ecstatic event of collective effervescence, subtends  all but the body (299). The superhuman powers attributed to high gods  reflect the personification of the undifferentiated forces stemming from  the shared experience of collective effervescence. As a shared collective  representation, the high god captures the experience of the whole facili- tating the means by which the tribe becomes aware of itself as a totality  (299). These elementary beliefs however, also depend on rites and are  affected by them. Book III, “The Principal Modes of Ritual Conduct” attends to ele- mentary rites, this being necessary to completing the theoretical model  of the “cult” that combines beliefs and practices. Beliefs, mythologies,  cosmologies and doctrines are means for guiding conduct, designed to  produce and reproduce experiences of this power greater than the indi- vidual, especially in ritual form. Through the cult, groups and their mem- bers reaffirm their commitment to the cult hence also reaffirming the  basis of solidarity and mutual obligation shared by members. Through- out the five chapters that comprise Book III, Durkheim emphasizes the  efficacy of the cult, especially how it contributes to the re-creation of “a  moral being on which we depend, as it depends on us” (352). For him,  the name for this being is “society.” Every cult consists of a complex and intertwined combination of  negative and positive rites. No single rite can be fully understood on its  own. Durkheim begins with the negative rites, consisting of prohibited  ways of acting aimed at the maintenance of respect for sacred objects.  Taking the form of interdictions (taboos), the system of negative rites  works to prevent unsanctioned mixing and forms of contact between  sacred and profane. Violation (sacrilege) is believed to bring spontan- eous physical disorder (e.g. sickness, revulsion, death) to the offender.  Additionally, the guilty one (a sinner) is denounced and punished by  public blame or disapproval, even if minimally. Stressing that religious  prohibitions are categorical imperatives grounded in collective respect,  Durkheim re-emphasizes the distinction between religion and magic,  pointing to the latter’s essentially utilitarian elements. Spatial and temporal prohibitions govern and define the system of  the negative cult. First, religious and profane life cannot spatially co- exist, hence the institution of “temples and sanctuaries” (312). Second,  profane and religious forms of life cannot temporally coexist, hence the  institution of “holy days” (313). Consequently, there is also a separation  </page> <page sequence="19"> EFRL: diSCurSive MonuMent, SyMboliC feaSt               491 of activities according to days defined as religious/holy and secular. For  example, inasmuch as work is defined as a profane activity, its cessation  is required during days set apart as holy. Spatial and temporal separa- tions are most pronounced in simple societies where group life is clearly  delineated by periods of concentration and dispersion. It is important to stress that the system of religious prohibitions is a  means to an end, a necessary but insufficient condition for the “positive  cult.” The cumulative and transformative effects of negative rites are  well illustrated in the Australian example of the novice undergoing tribal  initiation who is required to bear significant abstinences. It is in relation  to this that Durkheim discusses the important role that ascetic suffering  plays in all forms of religious life. Far from being exceptional, asceti- cism is an “essential element” of religious life (316).  First noted by Konrad Theodor Preuss (1904), physical pain is in  itself regarded as generative, sanctifying, and even virtuous because it  signifies a person’s willingness to break ties with the profane world on  behalf of the valued collectivity. Durkheim is thus able to draw connec- tions between excruciatingly painful ritual torments undergone by the  neophyte during an initiation ceremony hundreds of years before him,  and religious ascetic practices more familiar to his (typically Roman  Catholic) reader; both dramatize the relationship between renunciation  and transcendence, from being ruled by the profane concerns of embod- ied self and world, to a type of emancipation and “mastery over things”  without which society could not exist (320). The reader may at times  cringe from examples Durkheim provides of such things as ritual ampu- tations, tooth extraction, or ceremonies that require the novice to lie im- mobile on a bed of leaves and smoking hot coals (318). The principle at  stake is that to serve the gods, the individual must forget him or herself.  The most important principle Durkheim is bringing into view here is that  if it is to lift us “above ourselves,” society requires continuous sacrifices  on the part of its members. Asceticism and painful suffering are intimately connected with the  institution of sacrifice. As Durkheim continuously reminds the reader,  “religious interests are only social and moral interests in symbolic form”  (321). A condition of existence of social life is that members be will- ing (and ideally, enthusiastic) to place something above their individual  (especially bodily) interests, proclivities and concerns. Accordingly, it  is important to be mindful of the important relationship between respect  and the sacred in Durkheim’s account of religious life (cf. 269). Alluding  to the emotional energies intrinsic to the rhythms of collective life and  shared respect for the sacred, Durkheim writes, “Religious forces are in  fact only transfigured collective forces, that is, moral forces; they are  </page> <page sequence="20"> 492 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(4) 2014 made of ideas and feelings which the spectacle of society awakens in us,  not of sensations that come to us from the physical world” (327). Sacral contagion is part of what necessitates the cautious separation  of sacred and profane worlds. It is important to recall that sacred forces  are collective forces communicated, not part of nature proper. Sacred- ness necessarily carries within it “a certain transience” (322), rendering  the slightest contact with the sacred object dangerous. The mobility and  radiant power of the sacred thereby creates dangers, demanding that “ex- treme rigor” be used in the application of prohibitions dividing sacred  and profane. A simple illustration of this principle is the importance of  ritual washing (e.g., of instruments) preceding a religious ceremony. The negative cult bridges profane and religious life but to get to the  sacred, one must first create distance from the profane. The “positive  cult” is the system of rites that organizes and regulates religious con- duct. Imaginatively drawing on Spencer and Gillen’s works, Durkheim  concentrates on the complexities and efficacy of the tribal Intichiuma  ceremony of the Arunta. Celebrated by all of the Arunta clans, for Durk- heim this ceremony exhibits all of the essential features of the positive  cult. In particular, it contains the fundamental elements of sacrifice, that  Durkheim identifies as a foundational institution within “the positive cult  in the higher religions” (340). Taking place during the fertile season of nature, the Intichiuma con- sists of a two-phase celebration. In the first, a series of rites are per- formed to establish the the health and welfare of the totem species. The  second phase involves a heightening of prohibitions to reinforce the to- tem’s sacred power. A final ceremony involves a collective, ritualized  preparation and consumption of the totem species.  In his interpretation of the efficacy of Intichiuma, Durkheim builds  on, but transforms William Robertson Smith’s prior writings on sacrifice.  As the ritual meal involves communing with the sacred principle that  inhabits the plant or body of the killed totemic animal, god and worship- per become united in the same act. At stake is the renewal of the totemic  principle itself so that the tribe may remain itself (342). With his account  of sacrificial communion (and contra Smith), Durkheim emphasizes that  without the faithful the gods would not exist. The faithful periodically  renew and regenerate god, group, and selves simultaneously through rit- ual offering and communion. The circle of the sacrificial offering gener- ates a microcosm of society. Through acts of communion and offering,  “[a person] gives to sacred beings a little of what he receives from them  and he receives from them, all that he gives them” (345). Durkheim’s analysis of the positive cult demonstrates how ritual  life and social life are one and the same. And above all, it dramatizes  </page> <page sequence="21"> EFRL: diSCurSive MonuMent, SyMboliC feaSt               493 the importance of collective renewal through collective assembly. Such  congregating plays an essential role in developing and revitalizing the  self-awareness of the collectivity as such. Although most of the time the  demands of life are such that people are more or less dispersed, periodic  assembly is a necessary condition for the perpetuity of a group. This is  as true for the Australian tribes that occupy the bulk of Durkheim’s focus  in The Forms as it is for any contemporary group or society. As he states,  “Let the idea of society be extinguished in individual minds, let the be- liefs, traditions, and aspirations of the collectivity be felt and shared by  individuals no longer, and the society will die” (351). Having established the general importance of the positive cult, es- pecially through the example of sacrifice, Durkheim next examines mi- metic (imitative), representative (commemorative), and piacular rites.  Mimetic rites draw on two general principles: “contagion” and “like pro- ducing like” (360). Consisting of sounds and movements, they both ex- press and recreate the kinship between clan member and totemic species.  Challenging Tylor and Frazer’s rather abstract explanation, Durkheim  argues that as members assemble for the rites, they believe themselves  to be the species whose name they bear. Through assembly, and with the  totem emblem as “rallying sign” (362) that gets marked on bodies and  emulated through sound and gesture, members affirm their feeling of  belonging to a moral community; they “take cognizance of the kinship  that unites them” (362). The rite simultaneously expresses and recreates  this kinship. Throughout his writings, and pronounced in The Forms, Durkheim  rejects psychologistic or utilitarian explanations of human action to ad- vance a materially anchored form of sociological reasoning. For example,  Durkheim draws attention to the efficacy of ritual practices that affect the  consciousness of the member. Feeling euphoric from the ceremony, the  faithful morally reconstitute themselves. For the practicing member, the  efficacy of the system of rites seems inseparable from each single part of  the ceremony. It is in relation to this that Durkheim locates the origin of  faith, for while the believer does not understand the “specific power pre- scribed by dogma to each rite taken separately” they nevertheless feel as  if “it would be impossible to emancipate themselves from those without  falling into moral disarray” (364). What is at stake is not the “truth” or  usefulness of the individual proposition or part, but rather the “invisible  influence” over consciousness that participation in the whole event cre- ates. Pertinently, it would be impossible to “disprove” the effectiveness  of the rite through a scientific experiment, over and against what Durk- heim calls this “favorable prejudice” (365). Faith is no simple cognitive  </page> <page sequence="22"> 494 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(4) 2014 matter; it is felt within the very soul of the believer. Denial, then, would  constitute a moral and existential upheaval for the believer. Further, drawing on Hubert and Mauss’s general theory of magic  (2001 [orig. 1902]), Durkheim uncovers its socio-religious origins.  People’s faith in magic, although seemingly detached from collective  life in the figure of the lone magician, itself derives from some previous  collective effervescence. Durkheim next expounds on a more general  theory of knowledge, drawing critical connections between religious  and scientific histories and origins. The “origin of the precept on which  mimetic rites rest,” he argues, can be used to explain the origin of the  principle of causality (366). He discusses the twofold character of the  idea of religious “force”: it is experienced inwardly, yet moral forces  are impersonal and external to individuals. In the case of moral forces,  the faithful feel the force internally. Furthermore, they are never fixed in  any one individual, and they spread contagiously. Physical forces have  similar properties; we perceive their effects when they resist us, “but not  the force itself” (369). The human experience of being social provides  access to understanding how causality works by moving things within  the context of relations with other things. Although it includes the idea of  force, the scientific principle of causality includes a reflected judgment  concerning the effects of an antecedent cause. Durkheim is hereby chal- lenging both pure empiricism and the aprioristic idea that the intellect  is the ultimate creator of the principle of causality. Collective life is the  template through which we give meaning to our experiences, providing  the means by which we can reason and reflect on them (372). In his discussion of representative (i.e. commemorative) rites, Durk- heim emphasizes how the group regenerates a historical sense of itself,  integrating members in time, especially by rendering its “mythical past  present” (379). A mythology, Durkheim explains, consists of a moral  system, a cosmology, and a history. In a most general sense, commemor- ative ceremonies revitalize both conscience and (group) consciousness.  They also render visible the recreational and the aesthetic dimensions of  religious life. He focuses especially on the Intichiuma rites amongst the  Warramunga to locate the origin of games and major forms of art within  religion. Although Durkheim does not hesitate to remind his reader that  religious rites belong to “the serious side of life” (386), recreation is  no mere add-on as it constitutes an integral component of the moral re- making accompanying the positive cult.  Religious ceremony is essentially connected to festival, which once  again brings into view the primacy of collective assembly within ritual  practices. In his discussion of festival, Durkheim highlights the emotion- al resonances of collective life. Joy and exuberance are not trivial but are  </page> <page sequence="23"> EFRL: diSCurSive MonuMent, SyMboliC feaSt               495 important elements of group revitalization. A memorable example Durk- heim cites is that of the Laughing Boy totem of the Warramunga (383).  Throughout his general discussion of commemorative rites, Durkheim  re-emphasizes the non-utilitarian dimensions of religious life, highlight- ing its emotionally powerful, deeply social, creatively effervescent, and  morally revitalizing dimensions for the believer. The positive rites en- gender consciousness of the group, and in so doing reaffirm the moral  unity necessary for group survival. Durkheim’s discussion of ritual conduct concludes with a considera- tion of what he terms “piacular rites.” Although both mimetic and com- memorative rites belong to the serious sides of collective life, they are  nevertheless happily and confidently enacted (392). In contrast, piacular  rites are used under trying conditions of loss or fear and are sad and  mournful. He emphasizes that mourning is a collectively sanctioned re- lationship to calamity, a collective obligation like any other, and thus not  a “natural” or pre-social response. Why, Durkheim wonders, does the  deceased member demand mourning, which may take the form of harsh  abstinences or cruel sacrifices? Like all positive rites, mourning practices bring about a state of effer- vescence amongst practitioners. To commune in sadness, after all, is still  to commune. The crucial sociological point concerning mourning rites  is that they constitute forms of moral communion, reaffirming the group  that has just suffered a loss. The idea of the soul as outliving the body  is found here, inasmuch as the soul stands for a part of the social group  being revitalized following a loss or calamity. Poignantly, Durkheim ex- plains that “[p]eople cry together because they continue to be precious to  one another and because, regardless of the blow that has fallen upon it,  the collectivity has not been breached” (405). Death, illness, insufficient  harvests, drought, famine, etc., are different examples of events causing  collective distress, worry, or fear, and whose occurrence threatens the  collectivity. The collective nature of mourning rites thus “raise(s) the  vital tone” (411) and in this way, such rites work to neutralize the same  dangers that brought them into being. The group becomes conscious of  its power to withstand calamities, precisely by bringing group members  together. New memorializing collective representations can subsequent- ly form to mark the loss for the group. In the final section of Book III, Durkheim develops the idea of the  ambiguity of the sacred, crediting Robertson Smith for differentiating  between two modalities of sacred: those that are benevolent and pure,  inspiring respect and gratitude, and those that contain “horror”, i.e. evil  and impure powers that bring “disorder, death and sickness” (412). The  sacred, in other words, is not simply the good and the holy because it also  </page> <page sequence="24"> 496 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(4) 2014 consists of evil and pollution; for Durkheim both symbolize different  aspects of collective reality. In addition to the need for both pure and im- pure sacred to be kept strictly separate from the profane, contact between  the two types of sacred is considered a terrible profanation. According  to Durkheim, Smith insufficiently accounted for the distinction between  pure and impure sacred, thus he devotes the final pages of the chapter  to its explanation. Whereas the “pure” sacred belongs to the positive  cult, the contaminating powers of “evil”, i.e. “impure sacred”, Durkheim  reasons, must emerge from piacular rites; they are a potent expression  and symbolic manifestation of the collective anxieties and emotions that  gave rise to such rites, working to neutralize them, for example, through  proper burial of the deceased member. Although he leaves the distinction  somewhat under-developed in The Forms, the relationship between the  “pure” and “impure” sacred, and the theoretical utility of such a distinc- tion, was more fully developed in the work of Durkheim’s celebrated  student, Robert Hertz (1960), as well as in the writings of Hubert and  Mauss.  Durkheim reiterates the central argument and method of the text in  his conclusion. The author is confident in having made his case, namely  that the most fundamental ideas, essential relationships, and major forms  of ritual conduct, are found in the single case of pre-modern Austral- ian totemism (418). Rebutting the scholar who imagines s/he has found  the essence of religion in representations, i.e. beliefs, Durkheim reminds  his reader of the importance of practices in his account of religious life  (420). As emphasized throughout Book III in particular, it is only through  the cult that religious beliefs have efficacy. This is another way of saying  that a society can only exist if members assemble and act cooperatively.  This leads Durkheim to conclude that social reality lies at the core of  religion (421). At this point, he returns to the religious origins of the  fundamental categories of thought. Durkheim concludes by solidifying his case that religion stems en- tirely from social reality and that there are no false religions. He draws  attention to the social origin of ideals and images of a “perfect” society.  Along similar lines, he explains that immoral conduct expresses the “real- istic” dimension of religion: devils, gods and angels are equally aspects  of the “real” society, albeit enlarged and transformed (423). Religion  thus reflects, and is a representation of, all aspects of social reality, even  its most repugnant ones (423). Accounting for the formation of the ideal  (424–425), Durkheim acknowledges that a society undergoing change  may be divided by conflicting ideals, a conception central to his under- standing of transformations taking shape in modern societies. Ideals are  fully of the world, because they are formed and communicated to people  </page> <page sequence="25"> EFRL: diSCurSive MonuMent, SyMboliC feaSt               497 in social life (425). True to his social ontology, Durkheim stresses that  that collective consciousness depends upon a prior “sui generis synthesis  of individual consciousnesses”, the product of which is “a whole world  of feelings, ideas, and images that follow their own laws once...born”  (426).  Referring to modern society, Durkheim’s discusses increasing differ- entiation and the cult of the individual. Though individualized religion  may on the surface appear to complicate his overall account of religion,  religious forces being engaged in such cases remain instanciations of  social forces (427). Personal piety may keep a faith alive for a period  but not indefinitely; to account for the perpetuity of beliefs one must ac- knowledge that a faith is shared with others. Further, to feel inspired by  religious conviction implies a desire to spread those convictions. Some- what related to this point, Durkheim makes reference to the emergence  of international gods, which are themselves the fruits of tribal mixing,  territorial fluidity and the movement of people (428), which today we  call global culture. Durkheim anticipates the waning of national borders  and the emergence of global sociality that increasingly touches on uni- versal ideals (428–9). The collective and communicative nature of religion constitutes its  enduring, eternal form, even given changes to its substantive features  (429). Moral renewal in which shared sentiments are reaffirmed and re- created can only be accomplished with regular assembly (429). The con- temporary social theorist may need to be imaginative, supposes Durk- heim, for during periods of moral malaise or mediocrity, when the old  gods are dying off and new gods have yet to be born, it may be difficult  to conceive of such events, especially on a grand collective scale. Durk- heim’s sociological convictions here lead him to speak in the language  of moral prophet, assuring the reader that “new ideals will again spring  forth and new formulas emerge to guide humanity for a time” (429).  His brief reference to the fleeting but enthusiastic French Revolutionary  period provides a secular example of what such a day might look like. Finally, Durkheim understands himself to have lifted the veil of the  “mythological imagination,” and perhaps modern rationalist conceit, to  reveal the deep affinity between religious and scientific thought. There  exists persistent opposition between science and religion, in which the  former amounts to the negation of the latter (432). Religion is tied to ac- tion and living in a way that science is not, thus Durkheim supposes the  conflict to be limited. Even while religion lacks the self-understanding of  science, Durkheim contends that religion, rather than fading away, will  likely continue to change (432). </page> <page sequence="26"> 498 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(4) 2014 Concerning conceptual thought, Durkheim attends to the shared col- lective origins of scientific and religious ideas with their characteristics  of impersonality and stability, to offer a nascent sociology of knowledge.  Durkheim challenges any account of knowledge that imagines sense ap- pearance to be a source of unmediated truth, not least since the key com- ponents of logic are not to be found in unmediated observations of the  natural world (438). Logic itself is socio-historically emergent and Durk- heim credits the Greek Platonist tradition as a key source from which  logical life became self-aware (438). Central to Durkheim’s theory of  religion and human understanding is that beyond the empirical world  there exists a “whole system of representations that possess marvelous  properties” (438). Both religious and scientific thought fundamentally  share dependence on systems of concepts and categories pertinent to all  (435). As collective representations, concepts constitute the real basis  on which societies are able to think about and reflect upon themselves  (436). Collective representations found in religion and science pertain  to generalities and to think conceptually is to understand what is most  profoundly real (437). The authority of the concept comes from soci- ety; thus to be considered “true” any single concept or distinction must  align with society. Faith in science is not so different from religious faith  because the values of both forms of knowing are found in the social  world. Anticipating contemporary sociology, Durkheim explains that the  valorisation of science depends on shared ideas about what it is and does  for the collective (439). In the final pages of The Forms, Durkheim expands upon the fun- damental categories of thought (e.g. space and time) that provide a  framework for all other concepts and classifications. The most import- ant of these categories is that of “totality” (442). Durkheim also draws  attention to the conscience collective representing for him “the highest  form of psychic life” (445). He again makes reference to an emergent  internationalism that continues to push the boundaries of people’s under- standing of existence (446). Ambitiously, Durkheim claims to have re- solved the antimony between science, religion and morality, inasmuch as  he has developed an account of how they emerged from the same basis,  namely the elementary forms of religious life (446). Durkheim credits  Kant for having understood elements of this even if failing to under- stand the basis of the dual constitution of humans and the dialectical  relationship between individual and society that generates the condition  of possibility of thought through the gathering of individuals (446–447).  Echoing a theme that permeates all of his writings, Durkheim reminds  the reader that society is itself a part of nature and its complex forces  from which a more elevated kind of life develops, transforming individ- </page> <page sequence="27"> EFRL: diSCurSive MonuMent, SyMboliC feaSt               499 ual components through societal combination (447). He reminds us that  understanding humanity and its diversity, by examining the nature of the  social world that simultaneously transcends and permeates individuals,  opens up a powerful explanatory approach within the human sciences.  The Forms serves as both argument for, and example of, this. theoretiCal ConSequenCeS: analytiCal and CritiCal The Disarticulation of the Sacred from Religion  Durkheim, in a novel way conceptually and analytically disarticulated  the sacred from religion providing an alternative to the typical view that  “traditional” societies are religious and modern ones “secular” (cf. Ber- ger 2001). In The Forms, the sacred is considered as actual social prac- tice in terms of an operational definition: it is that which is “set apart  and forbidden” and something that evokes powerful emotions of awe,  respect and horror. This makes it possible to methodologically extend  the analysis of the sacred to domains outside of religion, conventionally  understood (Turner 2006b). In contrast, religion proper, for Durkheim,  refers to the institutionalization of sacralisation pertaining to groups’  structuring beliefs (collective representations) and rites (practices; ac- tions) that, combined, form the cult of the moral community.  The disarticulation of the “sacred” from “religion” had a significant  impact on Durkheim’s broader sociological themes concerning the rise  of “moral individualism” and the “cult of the individual” in modern, in- dustrial societies characterized by a complex and highly differentiated  division of labour (cf. Fields 1995: xlix–li). Moral individualism has  emerged as an explicitly sacred idea and ideal of global sociality (e.g.  international human rights; “crimes against humanity”); it is sacred in  positive terms (i.e., sacrosanct, [Datta 2010: 179–180]) and is hence a  beneficial and potentially integrative collective representation and social  fact (Datta 2013). Durkheim also illustrates this kind of disarticulation  when he states that “great though the freedom we allow one another may  be, it would be tantamount to sacrilege for a man wholly to deny prog- ress or to reject the human ideal to which modern societies are attached”  (EFRL: 215). His concept of the sacrosanct status of the human person  (the “cult of the individual”) and scapegoating of vulnerable persons and  groups in moments of social crisis (EFRL: 404), of which anti-Semitism  was a prime instance (Durkheim 2008 [orig. 1899]), also points to mod- ern manifestations of the sacred distinct from a traditional institutional  basis in “religion.” Since the rights, capacities and civic engagement of  </page> <page sequence="28"> 500 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(4) 2014 the (modern) individual depend on a complex and egalitarian form of  social organization, the “individual human person and collectivity are  equally sacred” (Milbrandt and Pearce 2011: 242). Durkheim’s practical- political and educational sociology concerned the constitution, develop- ment and enhancement of specific social institutions to protect, develop  and sustain respect for the sacrosanct value of moral individualism as a  sacred ideal that lacked quasi-religious institutional supports.  Modalities of Social Being In providing a model of the elemental constitution of society and social  life, Durkheim presents us with three modal states of social existence.  The first is that of dispersion, characteristic of profane, predominantly  pragmatic economic life, in a division of labour necessary to subsistence  in which everyone is assigned their task and place. The second is that of  ecstatic collective effervescence. The third is the crystallized institution- al mode as one finds with an enduring religion, dependent upon the cultic  combination of beliefs and practices. This seems too limited a schema  for analysing the various qualities given to social life. Even viewing  them on a continuum inadequately resolves this. For example, there are  moments on the job working with others, possessing moments of joy,  effervescence, enthusiasm and creativity. Or, as has been described by  noted Christian church historian, Juroslav Pelikan (1973–1990), once  effervescent, deeply meaningful religious ceremonies can become dull  and routine, just something done habitually on Sundays; likewise, be- liefs may become dry, dusty, uninspiring dogmas. Or, one could point  to ostensibly effervescent occasions at a party or nightclub where one  certainly does not feel like “one of the crowd” and one’s sense of radical  difference from the revelers can lead to loneliness or even despair. Collective Effervescence: Phantasmic Origin of the Just Republic? There are more than methodological problems with Durkheim’s im- aginative use of ethnographic data from Australia. Given his concern to  reconstitute attachment to the ideals of the French Third Republic, The  Forms appears to function as an answer to the problems of civic sclerosis  and malaise. In this light, Durkheim’s conception of creative collective  effervescence as witnessed in the French Revolution is akin to a phan- tasmic Edenic myth of the founding of the just society, one prior to the  law (cf. Zizek 1999:  251–252), a state to which socialised peoples can- not return, and this on Durkheim’s grounds. After all, we live in a world  of social facts and cannot by an act of will erase that reality. Ironically,  believing so was precisely the error, in Durkheim’s view, of revolution- </page> <page sequence="29"> EFRL: diSCurSive MonuMent, SyMboliC feaSt               501 aries (cf. Durkheim 1961: 258; Pearce 2001: 45) and, we might add, of  George W. Bush in believing that toppling the tyrant Saddam Hussein (a  coercive social fact) would lead to the flourishing of liberal modern Iraq.  Rather, it is necessary to consider the complex conditions of existence  necessary to produce freedom and democracy in any society. Questions of Exclusion and Domination There are also significant problems with how Durkheim glosses over  the extent to which the sacred depends on domination and exclusion;  only initiated men in his empirical cases can be full participants in reli- gious, and by implication, societal life pertaining to the well-being of the  tribe. Sacralisation itself and the protection of holy places by rigorously  imposed interdictions, make holy places exclusive places, restricted to  powerful individuals even while those places are pertinent to all mem- bers. Contemporary debates about the ordination of women in Christian- ity highlight such dynamics. Moreover, the hegemonic status of tribal  high gods and the political economy of sacralised collective representa- tions generates “symbolic violence” in which dominant institutions and  groups are able to impose an official point of view on social affairs thus  delegitimizing, marginalizing, or demonizing others (Bourdieu 1989).  The formation of the Christian canon spurred by church leaders mobil- izing support for denouncing Marcion, whose theology was deemed her- etical, illustrates the point.  Curiously, while he mentions the scapegoating of women in his dis- cussion of piacular rites, and describes exercises of what could be called  domination and exclusion, analyses of these phenomena are noticeably  underdeveloped. Durkheim addresses scapegoating in “Anti-Semitism  and Social Crisis” (2008) but he fails to theorise sacral violence in The  Forms (cf. Arppe 2009). Indeed, this oversight contrasts sharply with  Girard (1972) for whom the sacred emerges precisely from an act of  collective violence on a marginalised person, a victim whose allies are  incapable of retaliation. Pertinent in this regard is the extent to which  subjugated groups supply ready pools of sacrificial victims feeding, with  their blood, the gods of the victors (Pearce 2011).  Durkheim stresses that people feel “good” and empowered by acting  “altruistically,” ostensibly in the interest of the well-being of “the whole”  as understood by a dominant group. Moral force is typically experienced  as a sentiment, a feeling and internal force; it may entail a kind of inner  buoyancy in which one feels uplifted and becomes stronger, or when  one feels the pressure of duties and obligations weighing on one’s con- science. The generally positive view of sociality that Durkheim’s sociol- </page> <page sequence="30"> 502 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(4) 2014 ogy invites need not imply that simply being together or acting in concert  is ipso facto humane and just. Rituals and ceremonies shoring up support  for fascist and authoritarian regimes constitute an obvious case in point.  Durkheim could be accused of romanticizing the group in The Forms  by leaving underexplored how the authority of clan leaders emerges, for  example (see Pearce, this volume). Although Durkheim neglects this, it  is important to acknowledge that this power and enthusiasm can be put  to vastly different and possibly very brutal, fascistic ends (cf. Bataille  1994). Impeded too by Durkheim’s focus on a single, elemental case,  is adequate attention to antagonistic and competing sacreds within or  between tribes. A fair criticism to make of The Forms is that it fails to  adequately theorize conflicts and harms arising from the imposition of  dominant moral regimes on subordinated individuals, groups and institu- tions, justified in the name of ensuring the security of the dominant. Inequality and Privatization: Their Dehumanizing Effects As much of The Forms brings into view, the experience of being and  acting in concert is the source of love, justice, enjoyment and ultimately  freedom. For Durkheim, it is how people are constituted as being able  to rise above egoistic interests and appetites closer to humans’ animal  nature and instead be other-focused, be “good,” and embody in practice  the goodness of loving, sacrifice, and duty to something beyond oneself.  This capacity emerges from actual social practices of assembled groups  not least through the empirical apprehension of those practices/rites af- fecting every participants’ or witnesses’ conscience; that is how an inter- nal force like one’s conscience can be based in the real. Yet, Durkheim  was too optimistic about social organisation, neglecting what his own  work says about power inequalities and exclusion as inherent to the ele- mental forms of social life as he describes them. Still, it is important to read the The Forms within the context of  Durkheim’s broader writings on modern societies, especially concerning  the need to substantially renovate democratic, egalitarian governance.  He explained how political and economic organizational forms pro- duce uneven hardships on people, disproportionately benefiting minor- ity dominant groups that reap socially produced rewards unjustly. This  was behind his innovative conception of the “forced” and (thus) unjust  contract, formulated in the context of “abnormal forms of the division of  social labor” (Durkheim 1984[1933]: 310–322). Understood in a modern  way, inequality, social exclusion, and inherited privilege thwart genuine,  spontaneous solidarity, giving rise to a “forced solidarity” (Pearce 2001:  129). Central here is Durkheim’s valorization of humanity as a whole  </page> <page sequence="31"> EFRL: diSCurSive MonuMent, SyMboliC feaSt               503 and cognizance of the difference and diversity necessary for organic soli- darity that itself requires considerations of social justice pertaining to all  persons no matter how “different” or even “deviant.” Moreover, Durk- heim does not simply argue the liberal point about “tolerance” and the  need for (negative) rights to protect individuals’ liberties: difference is  to be facilitated, and groups and the state are obliged to help vulnerable  persons and groups in realizing their potential insofar as it benefits and  deepens organic solidarity. So, taking Durkheim’s broader sociological  approach into account, while societal organization can produce unjust  hardships on people, it should equally be stressed that society is not in- herently a source of corruption. Rather, it is the prime site in which we  are made ourselves, and thus, we might say that a society can itself be  made more human and be organized from bottom to top to enhance hu- man fulfillment; injustice limits this, but so does privatization.  Durkheim’s sociology thus implies that an excessively privatized so- ciety, settlement, or institution is also a place that deprives persons  of their full humanity, robbing them of possibilities to develop them- selves more fully as social persons, in concert, with others (Datta 2012:  532–533). We can think here of such things as excessive car culture or  declining government support for public transit (Datta 2013), types of  neighborhood design in which there are no safe sidewalks, bylaws pro- hibiting forms of community engagement in public spaces (Milbrandt  2013), or even forms of parenting advice that discourage children from  taking social risks. “To be cut off from (a) communal source of life is  to be deprived of resources for individual happiness” (Cladis 2008: 98).  Accordingly, one could argue that privatized forms of existence that are  built and designed under the auspices of a weak (i.e. egoistic) and not  “moral” conception of individualism create the conditions for a uniquely  modern kind of moral suffering (cf. Cladis 2008). a diSCurSive MonuMent and SyMboliC feaSt In The Order of Things, Foucault describes in detail the discursive system  of possibility of the human sciences, sociology, psychology and literary  analysis in particular (1994). He thus provides means for understand- ing the conditions of possibility of the impact of The Forms and at the  same time, a reminder of the circumstance that we still inhabit the same  discursive world of Durkheim — sociologists remain contemporaries of  the text, and wittingly and not, are frequently intertextually positioned  by it. Foucault distinguishes sociology from the other human sciences by  noting its attention to how working, producing, and consuming persons  </page> <page sequence="32"> 504 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(4) 2014 generate for themselves “a representation of the society in which this  activity occurs, of the groups and individuals among which it is divided,  of the imperatives, sanctions, rites, festivities and beliefs by which it is  upheld or regulated” (Foucault 1994: 355). Foucault’s description is cer- tainly befitting of The Forms. But, while Foucault heralds Freud’s Totem  and Taboo for its contribution to a critical dimension in the human sci- ences (Foucault 1994: 379), we find The Elementary Forms of Religious  Life to be at least as commendable given its scope. But, how can sociologists account for the circumstance of diver- gent and conflicting interpretations, appropriations (Foucault 1972: 129,  136), and developments of The Forms (cf. Ramp 2010)? How could  work drawing on The Forms inspire the surrealist and phenomenological  interpretation offered by Georges Bataille (1989), Talcott Parsons’ func- tionalism (1957), Levi-Strauss’ structuralism (1969) and also provide  a central resource for the humanist rationalist critical theory of Jürgen  Habermas (1987)? These theoretical positions are not exactly compat- ible! Does this imply that Durkheim’s work is itself incoherent and rid- dled with contradictions (cf. Stedman Jones 2001)? We suggest it does  not, but rather points to Durkheim’s ambition to push his sociological  programme as far as possible, the result being it touched on the entire  terrain of the human sciences. In many respects, The Forms writes the  totemic emblem of “sociology” on the key concerns and frontiers of the  human sciences. Thus we concur with Pearce that Durkheim can be just- ly counted among Marx, Nietzsche and Freud as a “founder of discursiv- ity” (2001: 9; Foucault 2003: 387). To consider discursivity is to consider the effects generated by read- ing and rereading especially concerning the conception of the “object”  under investigation and the criteria used to assess knowledge claims  (Foucault 1972). Present intellectual times display a great deal of suspi- cion towards classic texts, particularly those written by the hands of fre- quently caricatured “dead, white, European males.” Prone to challenging  “canons” as part of a commendably critical scholarly practice, sociology  is also sometimes guilty of deifying “the new” with a fetishistic (per- haps amnesiac) modernism, forgetting “its already hard-won insights”  (How 2007, 19; cf. Fields 1994: xii–xxvi; Baehr and O’Brien 1994).  Unsurprisingly, engagements with an ambitious work like The Forms  have been both positive and negative in tone (cf. Tiryakian 2012; Durk- heim 1975: 205-303; Fournier 2013: 628–638; Ramp 2010). But, “there  remains the problem of the appropriate stance to take towards ‘flawed’  work” (Pearce 2001: 2), especially when compounded by entrenched  misunderstandings of texts. </page> <page sequence="33"> EFRL: diSCurSive MonuMent, SyMboliC feaSt               505 The unfortunately enduring and hegemonic impact of Parsonian  functionalist impositions on Durkheim’s work, for example, producing  serious distortions of Durkheim’s sociology, have lead generations of  sociology students to dismiss him as a guilty conservative unworthy  of serious engagement (Ramp 2008) and unable to account for social  change (Stedman Jones 2001: 5–10). Yet, we contend that many of those  same students (and their professors!) would very likely consider the  power and integrative dimensions of shared symbols for various col- lectivities (family, city, sport team, social movement, nation, etc.) to be a  sociological fact. Along similar lines, while most sociologists accept the  utility of Goffman’s model of “interaction rituals” as helpful for studying  everyday/night life, its Durkheimian underpinnings (drawn significantly  from The Forms) are commonly left unacknowledged (cf. Collins 2004;  Burns 1991: 26). Gouldner’s caution is pertinent: “A science ignorant of  its founders does not know how far it has travelled nor in what direction”  (1962: 8).  Even justified criticisms need not relegate works to the dustbin. As  Pearce notes, “the specification of the inadequate political and epistemo- logical assumptions within a text does not simply discredit it; it still may  be an advance in its specific field, and it may be possible to reformulate  it so that it is more coherent and productive” (Pearce 2001: 2). Critical  and creative engagement requires an ability “to recognize and unravel  the different discourses and chains of meaning that lie embedded in any  piece of theoretical writing and learn to put theory to good use, rather  than simply accepting or rejecting them” (Pearce 2001: xxi). Thus, in  addition to its status as discursive monument able to help contemporary  sociologists reflexively locate themselves in the epistemic space of the  human sciences, The Forms can also be taken up as a symbolic feast.  To read the papers in this collection is to confront the circumstance of a  plurality of creative and critical engagements with, and appropriations  of, a book pertinent to a wide range of sociological sensibilities. SynopSeS of artiCleS This collection represents, we believe, a substantial contribution to  contemporary Durkheimian scholarship, sociology and social theory  broadly speaking. Amid their diversity, these articles well reflect the the- oretic robustness of The Forms with their inquiries into a wide range of  contemporary social phenomena, including the nature of theorizing itself.  Through critical and creative interventions, innovative applications, and  the initiation of new lines of inquiry, they re-energise engagements with  </page> <page sequence="34"> 506 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(4) 2014 an already animated text, exemplifying the crafts of social analysis and  theorizing. Thus, far from The Forms being considered a now surpassed  artifact in the “Museum of Classical Theory,” or footnote in the history  of ideas, throughout this collection Durkheim’s multilayered text serves  as a significant resource and powerful sociological stimulus. Just as  active engagements with The Forms yield new insights into the ele- mentary forms of the sacred and profane shaping collective life today,  Durkheim’s concepts, categories, questions and models are here produc- tively deployed to consider phenomena unanticipated by Durkheim’s  own concerns. We suggest that what is being honoured and renewed in  recognising the totemic function of The Forms by sociologists (Watts  Miller 2012: xi) is the importance of committed, theoretically reflexive  sociological practice aiming to explain both shared vexations and on- going wonder about the sui generis nature of the social. Although they  overlap in significant ways, we have divided our synopsis of the articles  below into two general categories: those which are primarily concerned  with the theoretical implications of The Forms, including its production,  reception, and political dimensions, and those that more explicitly draw  upon The Forms to analyze specific and contemporary socio-cultural for- mations and events. Group I: Reading and Theorizing The Forms The first set of papers exemplifies the art and practice of rigorous and  committed theoretical research characterized by dialogical readings of  The Forms, its place in Durkheim’s sociology, and beyond. They offer  original, at times quite provocative, interpretations of his sociology of  religion. In addition to the broader Durkheimian tradition from which  they draw, these interventions are strongly marked by authors’ engage- ments with a range of theoretical resources from Gramsci and Foucault,  to Hegel and Lacan. In different ways, they serve as reminders that not  everything has been said about Durkheim’s work and that puzzles re- main, a point noted by Marcel Fournier at the outset of his paper. And  further, their different readings, emphases, and lines of inquiry bring into  being the inescapably oriented work of theorizing.  In “The Elementary Forms as a Collective Work: Henri Hubert and  Marcel Mauss’ contributions to Emile Durkheim’s Later Sociology of  Religion,” Marcel Fournier performs what could be called a religious  excavation of The Forms. He considers how Durkheim’s relation to Ju- daism may have shaped his understanding of the centrality of religious  practices, emphasizing the importance of both ritual and excitement in  Durkheim’s conceptions of religion and society. His rendering of the in- </page> <page sequence="35"> EFRL: diSCurSive MonuMent, SyMboliC feaSt               507 tellectual milieu in which the book was written and critically received  displaces the common image of this text as the crowning culmination of  Durkheim’s theoretical project. Fournier foregrounds the neglected work  of the L’Anneé sociologique équipe, especially early writings by Hubert  and Mauss, in the germination of some of Durkheim’s central ideas. And  crucially, he re-opens a question central to any reading of Les Formes:  in what sense is religion a distinctive social phenomenon? Fournier’s  answer is that it involves the ritualistic and representational methods by  which collectivities confront the haunting problem of their own disap- pearance. The elemental problem of group perpetuity is dramatized and  made particular by the death of the member. Contributions by Natalie  Polzer and Alexander Riley (below) attend to this issue explicitly. Lionel Obadia reflexively considers and critically interrogates the  marginalised place that Durkheim’s sociology of religion currently  occupies within French sociology. The central concern of the paper is  announced in its title: “Is Durkheim’s “Sociologism” Outdated? Debat- ing “Individualism” in Contemporary French Sociology of Religion.”  Obadia argues a definitive “No.” He argues that contemporary French  repudiations of Durkheimian theory are steeped in profound misunder- standings of Durkheim’s conceptions of religion and modern individual- ism, and their applicability to so-called contemporary “individualized”  spiritualities. Obadia identifies and reviews recurring deployments of  “individualism” within contemporary French sociology of religion, em- phasizing their partial readings of Durkheim. Individualism, Obadia ar- gues, is a complex reality and symbol of modernity to which religious  actors (among others) refer. Obadia thus emphasises Durkheim’s socio- logical conceptions of the individual, the sacralisation of the human per- son, and image of society as a “machine-producing Gods”, highlighting  the importance of Durkheim’s statement that “man alone does not be- lieve.” Misunderstandings of Durkheim’s central conceptual apparatus  he suggests, are symptomatic of a serious misunderstanding of the nature  of contemporary societies. Obadia’s intervention concludes by recom- mending a pragmatically oriented sociology in which forms of religious  individualism actually produced by individuals and collective actors are  given priority. Central to Alan Blum’s contribution is the basis of people’s attach- ment to group life. In “Durkheim’s Ruse: The Concept as Seduction,”  Blum accentuates the ceremonial nature of the symbolic order, arguing  that The Forms is at its heart a story about the relation of thought to  religion, with the problem of existential ambiguity playing a central, al- beit under-acknowledged role. Analysing what he terms the elementary  forms of reflective life, Blum proposes that religion functions as a ruse  </page> <page sequence="36"> 508 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(4) 2014 in Durkheim’s text, as it does in collective life more generally. It permits  the modern, purportedly secular subject to develop a spirited relation  to ambiguity against the backdrop of the accident of shared member- ship and the arbitrary, groundless basis of human being. Drawing from  ordinary language philosophy (“meaning is use”), Plato, Hegel, Simmel  and Lacan, Blum emphasises the centrality of desire within collective  life. Desire propels the creation of “concepts” as media for social bonds  and conduits for ways of “doing.” Like the accident that is one’s family  name, conceptual distinctions bind members in powerful and enduring  ways. Collectively generated concepts are thus read as “images” or “re- flections” that mirror modes of being social. Despite their contingency,  beliefs and conventions aim to reaffirm the intelligibility of the social  order by treating it “as if” it is sacred and untouchable, hence the “ruse.”  Emphasizing Durkheim’s sacred-profane model, totemism, classifica- tion and collective representation, Blum argues that the “enigma of am- biguity” is dramatized in The Forms in ways that reveal its constitutive  existential consequences. The central lesson of Durkheim’s text, Blum  argues, is that what fortifies us is our elemental need and desire to be in  society. And while captivated by (and largely captive in) social being,  members also improvise within the grips of this inescapable condition.  Theoretical work itself, including the relation of reader to text, can be  read as a sign of such a relationship. The political (and potentially violent) implications of The Forms is  the central focus of William Ramp’s article “The Elementary Forms  as Political (A)theology.” Ramp addresses how The Forms can help  us to understand sovereignty and revolution in a manner pertinent to  a resurgent interest in political theology. The “disturbing potential” of  Durkheim’s conception of religion, Ramp argues, has been eclipsed by  an emphasis on solidarity and the renewing effects of collective ritual.  Ramp directs attention to the significance of the post-revolutionary  context within which Durkheim lived and wrote. Raising important  questions about the relation of social theorizing to politics, he suggests  that the curious absence of an explicit discussion of monarchical  sovereignty in The Forms reflects a political and thereby oriented refusal  on Durkheim’s part. This discursive tactic, Ramp argues, amounts to  a “literary decapitation” to preclude the appropriation of Durkheim’s  own sociology by apologists for monarchism, and reactionaries. His  engagement with The Forms thereby re-opens issues concerning sover- eignty and absolutism today when notions of social totality are treated  with utmost suspicion. Drawing on a range of Durkheim’s other writings  on revolution (notably his thesis on Montesquieu), and recent writings  by Agamben and Kristeva, Ramp develops a conception of the monar- </page> <page sequence="37"> EFRL: diSCurSive MonuMent, SyMboliC feaSt               509 chical sovereign as a collective representation and figure made sacred.  The rhetorical effect in Durkheim’s work is thus that relative inattention  to the ancien régime becomes a “political non-act.” The scant attention  Durkheim gives to significant events such as the Paris Commune, Ramp  suggests, may have been partly motivated by his keen sense of how revo- lutions transform identities and energize actions in ways that can lead to  violent excess, while compromising duty, positive social constraint and  collective moral force. Frank Pearce advances an appreciatively critical reading of EFRL in  his paper, “Challenging the Anthropomorphic Master Narrative in the El- ementary Forms and Forging a More Materialist Durkheimianism.” This  intervention paves the way for a fruitful synthesis of Durkheimian and  Gramscian social theory, inflected with critical realism. Arguing that The  Forms is a deeply flawed text, he maintains that its richness can be re- cuperated through careful engagement with Durkheim’s earlier writings  on religion and social organisation to elaborate a more nuanced theory  of religion than is found in The Forms. Pearce questions the plausibility  of Durkheim’s claims about the nature of sui generis entities as found  with his conceptualization of society, the collective conscience, religion  and institutions, each of which have emergent properties. These proper- ties include consciousness and self-consciousness and even a reflexive  consciousness. This model of the specific properties of social institu- tions, social agents and societies can be very useful but becomes prob- lematic when overly reliant on metaphorical and analogical language.  Pearce argues that The Forms, in particular, problematically anthropo- morphizes sui generis phenomena like society, the collective conscience,  and religion rendering them virtually indistinguishable from each other.  He challenges this anthropomorphism and Durkheim’s ungrounded op- timism, which he argues is based on a belief in the inherently positive  quality of religion and hope that societies will produce institutions nec- essary to their existence. Drawing on critical realism and resources in  Durkheim where he avoids anthropomorphism, Pearce develops a non- anthropomorphic Durkheimian conception of society as an emergent sui  generis entity. Gramsci’s conception of class struggle and hegemony is  combined with this to complete Pearce’s retheorization, resulting in a  much renovated model of society based on the asymmetrical articulation  of competing overlapping groups rather than on a homogenous collec- tive conscience.  </page> <page sequence="38"> 510 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(4) 2014 Group II: Creative Deployments and Contemporary Analyses Contemporary cultural analysis and case-study research loom large in  this collection, demonstrating the operational possibilities of engaging  with The Forms. The second group of studies exemplify the benefits of  dialogically reading a classic text in light of contemporary circumstances  and research strategies. The emotional intensities of collective forms are  emphasized in compelling ways throughout this section, and through  quite varied phenomena. Major themes from The Forms that figure  prominently in these pieces include the heterogeneity of the sacred and  profane, the generative possibilities of effervescent gatherings, totem- ism, the production of the sacred through potent symbolic representa- tions, and the sacred as an essentially energizing social force. In “The Elementary Forms of Carnival: Collective Effervescence  in Germany’s Rhineland”, Yvonne Niekrenz explores the structure and  meaning of contemporary carnivals. She emphasises their spatial, tem- poral and embodied structuring frames, and the pleasurable forms of  social frenzy that such events engender for participants. Her study is  a compelling contemporary illustration of the process by which the sa- cred comes to be disarticulated from formal religious institutions. Drawn  from an ethnographic study of an annual Rhenish street carnival, the  “extraordinary” lifeworld of carnival is conveyed by the inclusion of  participant comments, field observations and local textual materials per- taining to various street events that punctuate the paper. Revealing its  fading, historical Christian (Roman Catholic) roots, the continued cel- ebration of this traditional festival is, indeed, puzzling. To account for its  perpetuity, Niekrenz argues that such collective and liminal events are  magnified occasions in which actors confront and enjoy the place of am- bivalence in contemporary social life. Her reading of Durkheim empha- sizes the potency of collective assembly and effervescence, highlight- ing the efficacy of social rituals, emotional intensities generated through  embodied social congregation, the importance of social renewal and the  generation of solidarity through “corroboree.” Her analysis draws fruit- fully from Maffesoli’s conceptions of post-modern tribalism, proxemics,  and Dionysian social energies. The ethnographic detail brings to the fore  a variety of contradictory social experiences that Niekrenz argues are  part of the “extraordinary realities” and ambivalences that carnival time  brings into being: mortality and finitude, the intermixing of sacred and  secular, movement and play, sensuality and intoxication, and the oppo- sition between order/disorder. Stressing the play of social forms, and  accentuating the emotional and embodied dimensions of collective expe- riences in shared spaces and consecrated times, Niekrenz’s study draws  </page> <page sequence="39"> EFRL: diSCurSive MonuMent, SyMboliC feaSt               511 productively on The Forms to analyze a contemporary event, in ways  that emphasize and illustrate the sacred dimensions of secular culture in  a globalizing era.  In “The Market Totem: Mana, Money, and Morality in Late Moder- nity,” James Cosgrave draws upon The Forms to put forth a new analytic  framework for theorizing global financial markets within the current  global capitalist economy. The key to this framework is the concep- tualization of “the market” as a totem. Drawing on familiar visualiza- tions, such as the movement of the stock ticker and the economic chart  as domains of collective representation, Cosgrave develops a picture  of the dynamic and volatile character of markets as late modern “to- temic entities” which signify sacralised aspirations, beliefs and values  of contemporary capitalist societies. “The market,” he emphasizes, is  an essentially collective phenomenon irreducible to individual actors or  transactions. By drawing on and developing Durkheim’s early approach  to economic anomie, alongside The Rules of Sociological Method, Cos- grave analyses markets as “social facts” that are external to and coercive  upon people, and which generate particular ways of “thinking, acting  and feeling” (Durkheim 1982: 52). Cosgrave considers how the social  bases of markets generate powerful emotional investments, organized  around hopes that financial investments will rise to confer wealth (the  capitalist forms of mana) and fears that they will fall. While Durkheim  may have denounced the modern “market society” as socially danger- ous and immoral in his earlier writings, Cosgrave’s analysis paves the  way for a potentially fruitful Durkheimian-guided framework to theorize  the emergent and totemic features of contemporary markets and market- related phenomena, including speculation and confidence. Cosgrave’s  contribution is especially pertinent in the context of what can be identi- fied as a period of anomie within the global capitalist economic system. The articles by Natalie Polzer and Alexander Riley are Durkheimian  analyses of the social meanings of commemorative rituals pertaining to  traumatic world-historic events, namely the Jewish Holocaust (Polzer)  and the 9/11 terrorist attacks against the United States (Riley). Polzer’s  article, “Durkheim’s Sign Made Flesh: The ‘Authentic Symbol’ in Con- temporary Holocaust Pilgrimage” is a theoretical intervention and also  a qualitative and comparative study of the ritual uses of Holocaust rel- ics in three distinctive and contemporary transnational pilgrimage con- texts. Developing an innovative synthesis between Durkheim’s notion  of “sacred symbol” and Benjamin’s conception of “authenticity,” Pol- zer advances the concept of the “authentic symbol” to account for the  transformed nature of religious symbols in transnational contexts. De- scriptions of the bodily remains and clothing of the doomed are woven  </page> <page sequence="40"> 512 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(4) 2014 into her narrative in ways that illustrate how “authentic symbols” are put  to work and engaged by participants in socially powerful ways. Highly  ritualized sequences and structured experiences embodying elements of  Durkheim’s negative and positive cult are richly detailed throughout the  analysis. The demand for “authentic” artifacts, Polzer emphasizes, is not  unique to Holocaust pilgrimage nor even religious experience; rather it  is feature of Western modernity dating as far back as late nineteenth cen- tury forms of tourism. It can also be seen in the contemporary cultural  form of “Dark Tourism.” While Polzer draws productively upon Dur- kheimian categories throughout the paper, particularly in relation to the  structure of ritual practices and the sacred as a fundamentally energizing  social force, she argues that the contemporary insistence on “authentici- ty” demands a modification of his conception of the relation between the  symbolic and empirical/material. As well as offering a powerful contem- porary case study, Polzer’s work points toward a critical Durkheimian  phenomenology. Through her cases, Polzer demonstrates how collective  representations and rituals are conditions in and through which persons  come to understand a set of traumatic events at a deeply subjective level. Significantly, Polzer’s work provides a neo-Durkheimian reply to  Agamben’s charge, one that can be traced back to Levi-Strauss (1969;  Hénaff 1998) that the Durkheimian conception of the sacred reduces to  psychologism (Agamben 1998: 77–78). What Agamben misses is the  sociological import of attending to the affective and deep phenomeno- logical consequences of sacralisation and the systems of exclusion that  both constitute and sustain them. Emotions point to how what is external  to an individual’s consciousness comes to be manifest in the heart of  subjectivity itself, frequently unwittingly reproducing sacred differenc- es. Marked shifts in affective states are thus a methodological indicator  of the constraint and power of the social as it resides in, and has conse- quences for, subjective formations. Alexander Riley’s contribution, “Flags, Totem Bodies, and the  Meanings of 9/11: A Durkheimian Tour of a September 11th Ceremony  at the Flight 93 Chapel” is a rich cultural sociological analysis of an  ideal-typical commemorative religious ceremony at the “Thunder on the  Mountain Chapel” in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. This is a chapel devoted  to the memorialization of those who lost their lives on Flight 93, the third  plane to have crashed on that globally fateful day. Using ethnographic  methods, he attends to the neglected effects of “9/11” and its ongoing  story within the longer narrative of the sacrificial cult in American  civil religion. Riley makes the convincing case that understanding the  structure of totemic religion provides heuristic means for contemporary  cultural analysis of the sacred in US life. Riley’s description and  </page> <page sequence="41"> EFRL: diSCurSive MonuMent, SyMboliC feaSt               513 analyses of services at the Chapel compellingly reveal how “clan” and  “totem” are constituted and replenished in the face of the sacrificial death  and blood of the “heroic” member, one who sacrifices her/himself to  protect the community. The US flag serves as representation of the dead  national hero and hence partakes of and condenses what is held sacred in  American civil religion. In complementary and contrasting ways, Riley and Polzer emphasize  the constitution and effects of symbolic potency in contemporary com- memorative rituals. Both highlight the social meanings generated for  participants through commemorative rituals, emphasizing the powerful  creation of bonds between living and dead, that is, between the mortal  group member — who may be asked to sacrifice for the group in the fu- ture — and the “eternal life” of the collective in the face of traumatic loss  (death). Nationalism and the readiness to sacrifice for the collectivity, be  it the states of Israel (Polzer) or the USA (Riley) in the form of possible  future military service, are important themes raised in both cases. They  underscore the need for further investigation of the relations between  religiosity, nation, war and militarism in contemporary society, while  troubling the politics of sacrifice and sacralisation. Finally, Mervyn Horgan’s article “Durkheim, Development and the  Devil: A Cultural Sociology of Zoning Conflict” is a case study of a  recent conflict over a rezoning proposal for agricultural land in rural  Nova Scotia. Like Riley, Horgan builds on the neo-Durkheimian cul- tural sociological tradition pioneered by Jeffrey C. Alexander. Guided  by this approach and drawing on a detailed study of a land proposal that  was ultimately defeated, his study affirms Durkheimian-derived insights  into the centrality of the sacred-profane binary in organizing the civic  sphere. By showing how symbolic power is also a moral power, Horgan  analyses the creation of moral community through meaningful invoca- tions of the sacred, in this case, the sanctity of farmland. Drawing on  ethnographic materials in ways that bring Durkheim’s conceptual ap- paratus to new life, Horgan’s study includes a rich examination of the  dynamic relationship between beliefs and rites within the political life  of a farm community. His study of the symbolic and material battle over  the value and use of low-density rural land provides means for challeng- ing the implicit urban imperialism underlying much of the contemporary  social sciences literature on municipal politics. Horgan’s study invites  further comparative examination of how notions of the “local” can be- come sanctified and energizing for community members in the face of  socially dangerous, and apparently “outside” influences (such as land  speculation).  </page> <page sequence="42"> 514 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(4) 2014 diSCuSSion: o Canada? Before concluding, we wish to draw attention to the displacement of  “Canada” in the genealogy of Durkheim’s book, and hence too, in the  formation of modern sociology and social theory. Certainly, there is no  denying the significance of the Australian case for Durkheim as has been  exceptionally well discussed by Watts Miller (2012). But The Forms  contains numerous footnotes detailing Durkheim’s reference to aborig- inal peoples in Canada, drawing on Franz Boas’ research in particular.  For instance, Durkheim notes the use of special ceremonial masks on  the North West Coast (114, n76), Haida and Iroquois beliefs about the  descent of man [sic] from animals (135), a Kwakwaka’wakw (Kwaikiutl)  legend from British Columbia (136, n34), the belief in sacred parts of the  body “among the Hurons, the Iroquois and the Algonquins” (158, n3)  and the Algonquin “manitou” is cited as an example of the notion of the  totemic principle (EFRL: 196), something made familiar to Canadians  through the winter holiday song, “Huron Carol.”  Most significantly, it is little known beyond specialists in the his- tory and development of Durkheimian social science, that an essay by  Durkheim’s nephew and closest collaborator, Marcel Mauss, supplied  Durkheim with the idea of “collective effervescence” in his work with  Henri Beuchat, Seasonal Variations of the Eskimo: A Study in Social  Morphology (Mauss 1979 [1906]; Fournier 2013: 506-507; 612; see also  Fournier, this volume). We see Mauss discussing “Baffin Island and the  northern shores of Hudson Bay,” “Labrador,” and the “Saint Lawrence  area of northern Canada” (Mauss 1979: 24).  According to extensive ethnographic reports of Arctic peoples, indi- vidual families disperse and engage in hunter-gatherer activity in sum- mertime. In the winter months, families return to a shared, collective  “settlement,” “a group of assembled families who are united by spe- cial ties and who occupy a habitat [... consisting of] a concentration of  houses, a collection of tent sites, plus hunting-grounds on land and sea”  (Mauss 1979: 27). In wintertime, assembled families participate together  in on-going festivities. As Mauss writes, “One can thus describe winter  life as one long celebration,” involving “non-stop religious life” (58). In  a manner presaging The Forms, Mauss notes that,  Winter is a season when Eskimo society is highly concentrated and in a  state of continual excitement and hyperactivity. Because individuals are  brought into close contact with one another, their social interactions be- come more frequent, more continuous and more coherent; ideas are ex- changed; feelings are mutually revived and reinforced. By its existence  and constant activity, the group becomes more aware of itself and assumes  a more prominent place in the consciousness of individuals (Mauss 1979:  76) </page> <page sequence="43"> EFRL: diSCurSive MonuMent, SyMboliC feaSt               515 In short, the oscillation between two distinct phases of social life (sum- mer and winter) constitute the basis on which social morphology, the  organisation of space, community, identity and knowledge are combined  into a total social system. And yet, Mauss’ study of Arctic peoples re- ceives but one mention in The Forms in Durkheim’s concluding remarks  on the cycles of social life (354; Fournier 2013: 619). Henri Beuchat, a young member of the Durkheim research team and  student of Mauss, was to be the Canadian specialist. He was sent to do  fieldwork in the Canadian Arctic on the recommendation of “Marius  Barbeau, one of the first members of Edward Sapir’s team in Ottawa to  set up the Canadian Arctic Expedition of 1913–1916” (Mauzé 2004: 64).  “Unfortunately, in January 1914 the boat on which Beuchat was trav- eling, the Karluk, sank. The young French ethnographer who could have  become an expert on Eskimo culture died of cold and hunger on Wran- gell Island off the coast of Alaska. [...] His tragic death may have put an  end to the development of French research in North America” (Mauzé  2004: 64; cf. Fox 1979: 14–15). While Beuchat faced a tragic end, we  hope that drawing attention here to the neglected impact of Canadian  data on Durkheimian studies will spur, along the lines recommended by  Riley (2010), new reflexive, critical, historical work on the “imagined  Canada” in Durkheimian sociology and anthropology. ConCluSion: being CharMed; being otherwiSe Our own reasons for continually engaging with Durkheim’s magnum  opus, The Elementary Forms of Religious Life, largely stem from his  conception of the life and dynamism of the social, its complexity, and  ambivalent powers. As evinced by his oeuvre, Durkheim had a remark- able capacity for conceptualising the bonds constituting enduring soci- eties, and a commitment to explaining imminent threats to what is most  humane and promising in contemporary societies. This distinctive Durk- heimian sociological approach is accompanied by his sense that combin- ing theoretical work, empirical research and practical-political concerns  is constitutive of the best of sociology as a social science pertinent to  all. The Forms is exemplary in these respects and the array of questions,  concepts, categories and models developed and deployed in the book  touch on all of the major contours of the epistemic space of the human  sciences. This is why it is a “monumental” work containing rich material  for the kind of symbolic feast of contemporary engagements evinced by  the contributions in this volume. </page> <page sequence="44"> 516 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(4) 2014 The tendency of conventional forms of religious piety to wane with  capitalist development and complex state formation, alongside the wax- ing of “spirituality” in which individuals draw on a range of beliefs about  the sacred, rites, symbols and trappings to create personalised micro- syncretisms, need not imply that Durkheim’s focus on the power of so- cial institutions geared toward “higher things” and la vie sérieuse, is no  longer sociologically pertinent in complex societies, especially in the  global north. As suggested by recent empirical research by Abby Day  (2011), contemporary religious persons in the global north are already  practical Durkheimians (if unwittingly), attending services and par- ticipating in the activities of collective worship and charitable works  precisely because they enjoy and draw strength from participating in a  moral community, caring for and doing things with others. In Durkheim- ian terms, they are being social. As demonstrated by the contributions  herein, neither does the decline of “official religion” require a narrowed  research programme restricted to the conventional concerns of the soci- ology of religion (cf. Turner 2006b).  Durkheim’s work suggests that in moments of collective efferves- cence humans constitute the actuality of their own immediate, imman- ent, yet transformative power. This is a human power to constitute rad- ically different social actualities. For him, to discover, experience and  conceptually apprehend the social power of being together with others,  serves to remind us of a radical otherness in all persons. This is not the  “Otherness” of the “Others” depicted by nineteenth century anthropol- ogy; neither is this the otherness and peculiarity of how “we” once were,  as narrated by historians; nor is it the “otherness” of our psychical struc- tures as explored by psychoanalysis and surrealism. Rather, it points to  the “otherness” of what we can be.  It is this existential constitution of the human animal as social via  collective representations that receive the transfer of collective sentiment  that fundamentally makes it possible for a person to genuinely care about  others, to be considerate and experience that which makes the power  of justice possible, even when people do not feel so inclined. This is a  paramount concern in Durkheim’s work, one evinced in his first major  work The Division of Labor in Society. Anticipating his later conception  of the joys of collective effervescence in The Forms, he stresses that the  requirements of moral life, facilitative of life together, are not simply a  matter of rules and duties in which we sacrifice our own interests for the  betterment of others without getting something powerful and beneficial  in return. As he puts it in The Division of Labor in Society, </page> <page sequence="45"> EFRL: diSCurSive MonuMent, SyMboliC feaSt               517 At the same time that our energies are freed from their daily obligations,  from their regular duties, they feel the need of tearing loose, of playing in  new circumstances where rules are neither determined nor imposed, for  the pleasure of doing and the joy of being free [...]. It is this need which in- spires all gratuitous acts we accomplish, from the refinements of worldly  urbanity, the ingenuities of politeness, the losing of sympathy in the midst  of the family, the kinds of attentions, the gifts, affectionate words or ca- resses between friends or relatives, up to the most heroic sacrifices that  no duty demands. For it is wrong to believe that these noble inventions,  as they are very justly called by Janet, are met with only in extraordin- ary circumstances. They are invested with the greatest importance; life is  full of them; they invest it with charm (Durkheim 1933[1893]: 430-431,  emphasis added). Thus, for Durkheim, doing what is right and good, moral and just, can  also feel good because it is consistent with an ontological harmony  through which people are constituted as persons in the first place.  This suggests to us that The Forms serves to remind the sociolo- gist that it is the joy and love of being together that makes life livable.  As Durkheim poetically states, “The only hearth at which we can warm  ourselves morally is the hearth made by the company of our fellow men”  (EFRL: 427). Of course, we take Durkheim to mean our fellow person,  for it would be inconsistent with his conception of a solidaristic social  order to imagine that moral life, and its continuous regeneration, applied  to less than half of all social members. Certainly, there are obstacles  to universalising love, justice, and solidarity, as Durkheim was so well  aware, but these are not insurmountable because such obstacles are also  social, sharing in its nature as historically emergent. The Forms is thus,  in the end, a sociologically optimistic book reminding us that we  have unactualised potentials for being  more humanely otherwise,  together. referenCeS Agamben, Giorgio. 1998.
