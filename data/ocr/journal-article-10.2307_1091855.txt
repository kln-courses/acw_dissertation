<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MODERN LAW REVIEW could form the subject of a critical question. It might appear from references to the Digest at p. 39 that the Romans used " jw gentium " to mean international law. Some allusion might have been made in Chapter 5 to the doctrine of the natural rights of States. It is said at p. 60 that "social engineering" is a phrase "not repudiated by Roscoe Pound himself." Surely Pound coined the phrase, and he likes it so much that he reiterates it in his latest book Justice according to Law. The references to legal textbooks given in the footnotes date mostly from the tinle when the lectures were delivered rather than when the book was prepared for publication. We need not be fastidious about that in a book of this kind, but two or three specific complaints may be made. References to Allen's Law in the Making are to the 1st ed. (pp. 2, 17), the 2nd ed. (pp. 7, 66), the 4th ed. (p. 67), or no edition at all (pp. 14, 20 and 91). It is strange to find Dicey's Law of the Constitution cited from the 3rd ed. (p. 17). A quotation from Sir Percy Winfield at p. 19 is said to come from the Harvard Law Review, but we must consult Paton's Jurisprudence (presum- ably the 1st ed.) to find the volume and page. The inconvenience of inconsistent or out-of-date references is increased where they are the sources of second-hand quotations. Whether "By me kings reign" comes from Chap. 7 or Chap. 8 of Proverbs must be left to theologians to decide (cf. pp. 42, 44). O. HoOD PHILLIPS. CASES ON CHURCH AND STATE IN THE UNITED STATES. By MARK DE WOLFE HOWE. Harvard University Press. [London: Geoffrey Cumberlege. 40s.] IT would be too harsh a judgment to say that the Founding Fathers shirked the issue of religion in constructing their new instrument of government, but it might be reasonable to assert that it was a subject upon which they felt less certainty than they did, for instance, on property or popular democracy. For purposes of political propaganda Jefferson could allow that men are endowed by a Creator with certain unalienable rights, but whether the Creator was an anthropomorphic God or a merely mathematical final cause did not greatly concern those wise and experienced gentlemen. The First Amendment to the Constitution mentions religion definitely and, in the context of State-building, negatively. There is to be no established religion and no obstructions to the free expression of religious ideas. Thus it has become possible to argue that the Federal Government, and, in its train, the State Governments are to be considered as definitely negative with regard to the pressures of the religiously inclined who would wish to influence government towards sympathy for their particular church or for religion in general. But the role of government as the impartial arbiter between the forces of religion and anti-religion has been difficult to maintain in an environ- nient where militant atheism has never proved as acceptable socially as moderate religion. Materialism and agnosticism have had their triumphs, notably in the Scopes trial, and their publicists of national renown in Ingersoll and Mencken; but the irreligious, it is confidently assumed, are temporary and light-hearted backsliders; they are not atheists. What have, in fact, been the practices of American communities become powerful arguments on the side of those who argue that religious sentiment is a natural and useful cement of the constitutional edifice, and that therefore this comfortable development of social values should bear more weight with the courts than formal constitutional principle. As Mr. Justice Reed put it in McColl/wm, dissenting: "Devotion to the great principle of religious liberty should not lead us into a rigid interpretation of the constitutional guarantee that conflicts with accepted habits of our people. This is an instance where, for me, the history of past practices is determinative of the meaning of a 890 VOL. 16</page><page sequence="2">constitutional clause, not a decorous introduction to the study of its text" (333 U.S. 208, 1948). If religion is a cement, the consciousness of religious diversity may well prove a solvent. Any public authority which by its policies emphasises this consciousness of diversity may find that its actions are not welcomed by the courts. That at any rate seemed to be one of the lessons of MoColluha, but the Court of Appeals of New York in 1951 (Zorach v. Clawson, 100 N.E. 2d. 463) gave its approval to a system of religious instruction in the State which differed from that condemned in McCollum by a hairsbreadth. The "wall of separation between Church and State" no doubt still exists, but it is no longer constructed of unyielding stone. New'and flexible materials are in fashion. The wall is no longer straight, but is conforming to the pattern of the varying political and social pressures applied to it by the weight of organised political-religious groups. All wish to find accommodation within the wall, for outside life is more difficult and rather more expensive. Professor Howe has compiled an instructive array of cases to illustrate the major phases of the Church-State question in the United States. The cases are arranged to illustrate various aspects of the general issue, but an historical line of development is also displayed. Disestablishment was the classic problem of eighteenth-century America, while education is the question of our time. To connect the two we have Mr. Justice Rutledge's immense opinion in Everton (330 U.S. 1, 1947) here reduced to a " flashback " of five pages-in the opinion of this reveiwer rather too summary a treatment. There is great variety in Professor Howe's selection; Disestablishment, the Church as Corporation, Ecclesiastical Adjudication, Police Powers and Education. We have Jefferson's researches into Hale's opinion that "Christianity is parcel of the laws of England" set out with a nice respect for the ancient reports and the Norman- French idiom. The vicissitudes of the Russian Orthodox Church are related in St. Nicholas Cathedral v. Kedroff (302 N.Y. 1, 1950). Here the whole history of the Church in modern Russia, from its casting out after the October Revolu- tion to its recall, in 1945, to political use as a part of the Soviet State, is set down in fascinating detail. In S. S. mad B. Live Poultry Corp. v. Kashruth Corp. (S.Ct. of N.Y., N.Y. County 158 Misc. 358, 1936) we hear the sad story of a Bronx poultry dealer who did not appreciate the extent of the jurisdiction of the orthodox rabbis. (The student will recall that chickens also made legal history in a famous New Deal case.) There is a comic diversion in the case of Guy W. Ballard, alias St. Germain, who used the much-abused U.S. mails for fraudulent "religious" purposes. The U.S. Supreme Court withheld canonisation in 322 U.S. 78, 1944. From such light reading we can turn to the U.S. Supreme Court's decisions in the Flag Salute cases and in Everson and McCollwm. The finale is on Broadway, with a double feature, the Italian film the Miracle and Streetcar, both of which, it was asserted, would give offence to the Catholic faithful, and Catholics are organised to repel attacks upon their faith and their moral values. Professor Howe is too modest in using the adjective "temporary" to describe this first edition. It is an important book of cases for the American student. Religion is an essential part of the American way of life and its importance for the constitutional lawyer may well increase, especially if the Federal Government takes bold steps to assist those great institutions of higher education in United States that are private foundations, for many of them have denominational origins. Religious questions are becoming somewhat uncomfortably involved in political issues in America. Many local, and even some Federal, practices seem prima facie unconstitutional, but the courts can take comfort in their difficulties from the view of Chief Justice John Marshall that the American constitution is not to be subjected to " refined and meta- physical reasoning" which might leave it "a magnificent structure indeed to look at but totally unfit for use."
