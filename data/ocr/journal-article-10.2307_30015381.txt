<plain_text><page sequence="1">Pigeons, People, and Paradise: Skinnerian Technology and the Coming of the Welfare Society Dennis Saleebey University of Texas at Arlington Many utopian visions have become clouded for lack of a technology with which to convert socioethical prescriptions into policy and program. The Welfare Society as utopia is in similar jeopardy. However, there does exist a technology which, used judicially and experimentally, could be translated into principles and practices de- signed to achieve the goals of the Welfare Society. That technology is the radical behaviorist technology of B. F. Skinner. This essay explores the possibility of the union of this humanist ideal and that behaviorist technology. Though pale by contrast, welfare policies and programs often spring from utopian visions of the future. These political-social reveries usu- ally adumbrate the proper relationship between, and adjustment of, human needs and institutional perquisites.1 Resolution of the tension between the confounding ideals of agency and communion is their ultimate promise.2 The Welfare Society is a utopian vision occasioned, in part, by the hesitant spurts toward equality and social justice in the sixties. While the Welfare State, tired and battered western ideal that it is, calls for the provision of relatively generous minima of social resources-not tied to work-for all, the Welfare Society is marked by a shift in institutional priorities away from the expansion of profits, produc- tion, property, and economic growth toward the constriction of pri- vate power and the development of public responsibility for the channeling of resources publicly committed to human development. Romanyshyn outlines the ideal in this way: "The concept of the wel- fare society stems from our aspirations to maximize the development of every individual. Man is the central concern. Human dignity and community rather than property or equality of opportunity are the central values. Welfare in this sense is not a separate set of institu- Social Service Review (September 1976).

All institutions are evaluated in terms of their contribution toward the development of the kind of human being we want and the social order we value."3 Wilensky and Lebeaux's classic distinction between the residual and institutional conceptions of welfare allows us to distinguish between welfare institutions as particularized, disorganized media of meager sustenance for those unable to care for themselves and welfare in- stitutions as focal means for the development of human resources.4 Alfred Kahn's conception of social services as social utilities (a full range of services provided to the community under public auspice, not private market, which are deemed essential to personal and social development), Richard Titmuss's notion of a universalist "welfare world" (in which all economies shift their base from private conscrip- tion to public provision of amenities through international redistribu- tion of resources and transfer of income), and Gunnar Myrdal's "wel- fare culture" (in which all social, political, and economic institutions center on the provision and expansion of social resources under the aegis of democratic decision making) are all statements about the shape of the Welfare Society.' These different conceptions directly or indirectly imply the follow- ing: 1. Social institutions will shift their priorities toward the develop- ment and allocation of all that it takes to sustain human functioning at a satisfactory minimum level. Beyond that, resources allowing, plan- ning will be geared to maximizing human capacities. 2. Decisions about the development and distribution of social re- sources (e.g., education, health, child care and development) will be, in part, returned to the people. 3. Survival of all, before allocation of resources toward develop- ment of the many, demands the careful and democratic setting of priorities and the intelligent planning and array of means to achieve them as the essence of "governmental" activity. 4. The orientation of social institutions around developmental requisites means that public policy must be firmly committed to the stimulation and testing of knowledge and its translation into a broad spectrum of social programs. In this way, social science knowledge may become the most valuable social resource. 5. A tenuous implication of the above dimensions of the Welfare Society is that axial values such as independence, personal autonomy, self-reliance, and private property may have to be supplanted by other values such as interdependence, the community as the basis for goal setting, and the world as the arena of impact for social policies. The Welfare Society as utopia is intelligible. As a practical matter it becomes murky. It cannot be realized without a bedrock of natural, human, and social resources and an articulate technology for creating</page><page sequence="3">390 Social Service Review and relating those resources to biological, psychological, and social developmental necessities. These, in turn, can only evolve from a sufficient level of affluence and an ample fund of knowledge ("sci- ence" and "philosophy"). Michael Harrington, in recounting the troubled fate of democratic socialism, argues that socialist failures have turned not so much on ideological and political corruption as on deficient intellectual, moral, and fiscal resources." But as the level of intelligence and social resource rises there will be a nearly inevitable confluence of both the ideals and style of democracy and socialism as human-centered social schemes.7 Democratic socialism and other utopias can only be based on "... the unprecedented development of technology and it can become an actuality only when there is a con- scious majority that masters that productivity and puts it to the service of human need."8 And "... the one set and undeviating aspect of socialism is its commitment to making the democratic and free choice of citizens the principle of social and economic life."9 So, the triumvirate of resource development and management, the technology of human development, and planning for both, all so clearly essential to the Welfare Society, needs a framework from which principles and methods of change can be generated. Has the visionary nowhere to turn? Is he stuck with the limp process of "muddling through"? Is he bound by stultifying incrementalism? Or is there knowledge available that can be translated into a technology in the service of human development and firmer community? The answer to the last question is yes. We have now a knowledge base, derived and tested empirically, molded into a lucid technology, which ought to be considered by the architects of the Welfare Society. It is the radical behavioral technology of B. F. Skinner. Behavior Technology Skinner is at pains to refute the existence of "autonomous" man. He regards this particular belief as completely inimical to human prog- ress. The myth of autonomy and the supporting ethics of freedom and dignity have created a society that relies heavily on a relatively ineffective, morally objectionable conglomerate of punishments and negative sanctions. Likewise, the philosophies that support autonomy obstruct effective social planning since the ultimate responsibility for action lies within the individual. The path to utopia is strewn with the corpses of"inner men."'10 Skinner would have us credit the environment as the source of behavior rather than "... the inner man, the homunculus, the pos-</page><page sequence="4">Skinnerian Technology and the Welfare Society 391 sessing demon."" What we do we do because the consequences of our actions are rewarding and directing. "Behavior which operates upon the environment to produce consequences ('operant' behavior) can be studied by arranging environments in which specific consequences are contingent upon it."'12 It is the arrangement, the timing and spacing of environmental contingencies, that extends or exterminates behavior. Both inner (subjective, mental) and outer (actions, observable behaviors) events are subject to the same laws or influences; they are not different classes of responses. "When we say that behavior is a function of the environment, the term 'environment' presumably means any event in the universe capable of effecting the organism. But part of the uni- verse is enclosed within the organism's own skin. .... We need not suppose that events which take place within an organism's skin have special properties for that reason. A private event may be distin- guished by its limited accessibility but not, so far as we know, by a special nature or structure."'13 More specifically, that precious sense we designate as "self " is "... a repertoire of behavior appropriate to a given set of contingencies."'4 Likewise, a "... culture is very much like the experimental space used in the analysis of behavior. Both are sets of contingencies of rein- forcement."'5 Behavior is most effectively produced, replicated, and shaped through contingencies that are positively reinforcing. Positive rein- forcers following a given behavior or set of behaviors increase the probability of the repetition of that behavior(s). " According to John Platt, human beings' need for positive reinforcers is as "basic and primitive as their need to survive."" Thus, the basic principle govern- ing the design of a culture is to planfully array contingencies that are positively reinforcing to desired (in terms of socially valued goals) complexes of behavior. Certainly, we do much of this anyway. The idea that people should be rewarded for things that they do in order to get them to do it again is as old as humankind. But, Skinner cau- tions, we do this mindlessly, inconsistently, and, consequently, inef- fectively. If culture reduces to the planning of contingent relations between behavior and its consequences what guides are there for the design of the "good" as opposed to the "bad"? Like Darwin (or more correctly his enthusiasts who saw in his theory a social-ethical imperative),'1 Skinner's bedrock ethic is sur- vival: "A culture, like a species, is selected by its adaptation to an environment: to the extent it helps its members to get what they need and avoid what is dangerous, it helps them survive and transmit the culture. ... It is only when the survival of a culture is taken into account that a special kind of design emerges, a design in which the</page><page sequence="5">392 Social Service Review contingencies of that survival shape and maintain the behavior of its members.... ."19 The link between the individual and the culture are those good things that exist as positive reinforcers and those things become good because they have survival value.20 With this brief sketch of radical behaviorism can we begin to outline the shape of the Welfare Society? Let us begin with Skinner himself: "Good government is as much a matter of control of human behavior as bad; ... attacking controlling practices done by those who defend the ethic of freedom is, of course, a form of counter control. It may have immeasureable benefits if better controlling practices are thereby selected. But the literature of freedom and dignity have made the mistake of supposing that they are suppressing control rather than correcting it. The reciprocal control through which culture evolves is then disturbed.'"21 The point is that all social institutions are agencies of control-whether totalitarian or egalitarian. However, control is felicitous to the extent that: (1) it is based upon the best available technology and knowledge; (2) each controlling practice is related to survival; (3) there is adequate balance between control and countercontrol. ("The ultimate strength of a controller depends upon the strength of those whom he controls.")22 We must, then, honestly examine the function of social institutions and to do that we must abandon the gratuitous language of permis- siveness or freedom because it obscures the issue of control in a shroud of dubious values. Permissive societies especially have been managed by punitive and selectively applied behavioral techniques (aversion, counterconditioning). Not only is punishment relatively in- effective as a behavior modifier or "motivator," but to swathe its use in the cloak of Enlightenment philosophy is simply dishonest. However, the widespread use of punishment is a logical extension of the belief that controls come from within and that we are the agencies of our own salvation or condemnation. It could not be otherwise. For Skin- ner, this is the crux of his critique of social institutions. What enlight- ened behavior control can bring about by returning control to the environment is an end to punishment and its accompanying affective correlates-anxiety, dread, guilt, frustration, and self-doubt. Likewise, it may promise the attenuation of "alienation" and "anomie," which are defined by Skinner as the absence of effective and positive reinforcers. This, then, is the humane center of Skinner's proposals. By way of concurrence, Harvey Wheeler suggests that the liberal democracies which emerged in the middle of this century began to exert increasing controls over general behavior. But this was accomplished largely through aversive and punitive measures. The "deferred social cost" of punitive control was the suppression of a wide range of behavior.23</page><page sequence="6">Skinnerian Technology and the Welfare Society 393 Radical behavioral technology, by offering positive reinforcers as in- ducements, holds the promise not only of being more efficacious but of eliciting a more extensive range of behavior-an idea which has been part of the Enlightenment ideal for nearly two centuries.24 This, in turn, makes more probable the exertion of effective means of countercontrol. Behavioral depletion is the condition of the domi- nated; a depressed individual being the classic example in individual terms, an oppressed minority the classic example in mass terms. Paulo Friere in his Pedagogy of the Oppressed contends that the oppressed need not only become aware of their condition but also learn to act competently. To do this they need to increase the richness of their behavioral repertoire.25 Skinner makes the same plea: extended be- havioral repertoires lead in the direction of co-control and away from oppression. The conditions for the alteration and redesign of culture that Skin- ner outlines are the prepotent conditions for the ultimate achieve- ment of the Welfare Society. Without such a technology, social plan- ning for human development remains a pipedream. What will be the hallmarks of a society loyal to radical behavioral principles? 1. Formerly aversive institutions will give way to institutions de- signed for effective behavior shaping-coercive socialization is re- placed by operant socialization. 2. Socialization will be for diversity and variety. "The only hope is planned diversification, in which the importance of variety is recognized."26 Variety is not just a preference but a necessity for survival-"If men were very much alike, they would be less likely to hit upon or design new practices, and a culture which made people as alike as possible might slip into a standard pattern from which there would be no escape."27 3. An extensively applied social technology emerges only through planning, design, and experimentation-especially on a small scale. It is here that the methods of behavioral technology and the exigencies of the Welfare Society converge. Planning, for the behaviorist, stems from the need to escape accidental and haphazard sets of contingen- cies. To do this, the behaviorist must design a system based upon the clear definition, operationalization, control, and manipulation of all relevant variables. For the utopian, planning is the means whereby there is an assured, quantifiable, and predictable relationship between resource and need, and social practices and goals. Both the utopian and the behaviorist can only maximize their outcomes through social experimentation and evaluation of the results of such experimenta- tion. "Planned societies can be sterile, stifling, and coercive, but they can also be creative, free, and open. It seems reasonable to assume</page><page sequence="7">394 Social Service Review that we are more likely to evolve into a society we like if we plan for it and construct environmental contingencies to increase the probability that creative and productive behavior occurs, than if we proceed without plans or without sufficient awareness of what variables con- trol our behavior."28 4. We will become a more truly democratic society in that the tech- niques and occasions for countercontrol will be specified and ex- panded. Ideally, democracy is the provision of countercontrol. The enemy of countercontrol, however, is bureaucratization, bigness, and the private monopolization of natural and social resources-the ele- ments that characterize our society, now run by the mythic motor of freedom and dignity. The architects of our government knew these dangers well. One of the authors (probably Madison) of the Federalist Papers in making a plea for a society that helps men master their passions and regulate their conflicts averred: "If men were angels no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controuls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: You must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place, oblige it to control itself."29 A clear statement, is it not, of the need for balance between control and countercontrol? Skinner's own words reflect Madison's concern: "... . the great problem is to arrange effective countercontrol and hence bring some important consequences to bear on the behavior of the controller."30 In any experiment, social or laboratory, the "symmetry of the reinforcement method" must be preserved, or it is doomed to failure.31 5. Authoritarian hierarchies are generally antagonistic to social experimentation except under certain oppressive and ethically ques- tionable conditions (e.g., how can we get workers to be more com- pliant?). But the Welfare Society, as mentioned above, can only evolve with the provision of experimental social space and with the designa- tion of experts in operant techniques as designers of that space. As- suming that such experimentation does proceed swiftly, what will the ultimate effect be? Wheeler suggests that we can anticipate three significant alterations in smaller social units. The first is debureau- cratization: under an operant technology the patterns of organization become the behavior patterns of the individuals that make up the organization. A top-heavy administrative structure, that tangle of rules, norms, and procedures, is the result of ineffective immediate means of control and countercontrol. Second, organizations will be- come smaller. Hierarchies of bureaucratic control will constrict as contingencies emerge through the development of natural operant procedures. Conditioning and behavior shaping is only effective</page><page sequence="8">Skinnerian Technology and the Welfare Society 395 when contingency variables within the specified environment are well known and deliberately related to designated organizational and so- cial behaviors. Finally, organizations will move toward self- management because the only feasible interactional context for oper- ant principles is the balance of control and countercontrol.32 6. The Welfare Society will be a society of "positive" liberty -freedom to do-as opposed to "negative" liberty-the occasional lifting of aversive conditions. It will be a society of expansion, not constriction. It will be a society moving toward the paradoxical ideals of autonomy and community.33 Here, whether they like it or not, humanists and behaviorists stand on common ground. Both advocate the expansion of human powers; the extension of behavioral ap- proach and cognitive reach. The ills that the humanists see-fetishism, exploitation, narcissism, aggression, sadism (the malignant charac- terology illustrated so beautifully by Fromm)34-are, in a sense, the products of negative liberty, the attempts to escape from authority, constriction, and oppression. The suppressive and narrow socializa- tion that produces these ills operates, to a large extent, on the princi- ple that internal controls must be built into human beings, no matter how viciously or capriciously applied. Skinner's critique of autono- mous man thus coincides with the humanist critique of the subversion of human nature in commercial-industrial society. The fear of liber- ated man in modern industrial society may be supplanted by the fear of constricted man in the Welfare Society. 7. Behavior technology will be of revolutionary democratic import because anyone can use it-its use need not be confined to scientific, political elites. In summary, then, radical behaviorist principles and techniques of behavior change provide a methodological juncture between the two elements essential to the Welfare Society-availability and specific ar- rangement of social resources (contingencies), and a technology of human development (behavior shaping or operant conditioning). And they do this in a dramatic way not yet provided by any other social science theory or scheme. It also meets the usual requisites for utopia-technological know-how and adequate resources (in that re- sources in operant technology do not have to be material objects).35 With insufficient or narrowly delineated resources utopians and Skinner alike sense that the authoritarian manipulation of technology becomes more probable. Finally, behavioral technology satisfies most of the criteria of liberal social policy including the perfectability of man, the necessity of planning for community, and the decline of objects as reinforcers. Further, such a technology implies that human nature is contorted and shriveled by the environment and change must come from the outside.36</page><page sequence="9">396 Social Service Review The requirements of simplicity, empirical validity, and generaliza- tion are all, at this point, met to a degree by behaviorist methodology. In addition, we have a frank and communicable basis for manipula- tion and power exchange rather than a disguised and hypocritical one. And the technology is decidedly antipunitive and promises change without barbarous, aversive socialization practices. Reservations and Uncertainties This essay cannot rest here. Though I have written in generally posi- tive terms about radical behaviorism, I am not a behaviorist, and I find much of behaviorist methodology to have disturbing ethical im- plications. Nevertheless, I am sure that Skinner's ideas have rev- olutionary import, even promise. Some reasons for my own circum- spection are set below. "Naive" Theory of Society Skinner and behaviorists as a group tend to be naive sociologists. In continually referring to environmental contingencies, Skinner ig- nores many of the realities of social life, at the macrolevel especially. He never mentions the importance of power, or institutional struc- ture, or the web of role networks in which we are all embedded. He simplifies in his mind what he in fact can simplify in the laboratory -contingencies of reinforcement. Skinner assumes, almost as a given, a kind of benevolent despotism. By skirting the swamp of daily political conflict and power struggles he is giving ".... expert sanction for programs of behavior control ..." and supporting, by implication, "... those who are already favorably disposed toward behavior control."3" Thus, he does not address the inevitable struggles over the contingencies of reinforce- ment which might follow on the heels of an "operant" revolution. There is little reason to suppose that control and countercontrol will emerge as an equitable balance between social unequals. The dramat- ic social significance of the fact that the greatest successes, if not excesses, of his technology have occurred in "total institutions" seems lost on Skinner."3</page><page sequence="10">Skinnerian Technology and the Welfare Society 397 Benign and Malignant Psychopathy When we finally assume that human beings are not ultimately respon- sible for their acts but responsive only to the contingencies that im- pinge upon their acts we have moved away from the "moral society" toward the "hospital society." Contemporary China is the best exam- ple of the latter. The Chinese reputedly have virtually eliminated aversive conditioning and have begun to socialize, resocialize, and exert social control in the form of positive reinforcement or "treatment."39 The operant human may be the benign psychopath: an individual blithely but singularly responsive only to available rein- forcements and not guided by personal decisions and commitments made in response to a confusing and conflicting array of possibilities. Life for the "hospital society" inmate is not a series of choice-points, but instead a predictable (perhaps perfectly amiable) path festooned with motivating, wholly external rewards. But benign psychopathy is not the worst possibility. Whatever cruelties the assumption of our own autonomy has wrought, it has led us to believe that we can control ourselves and direct our efforts, even in the absence of reinforcements, toward sometimes ill-defined end states shaped by ethical compromises. In effect, Skinner is asking us to reject the importance of dialectic tensions between indivduals, the possibility of offering new and autonomous meaning, and the central importance of indeterminacy in human encounters. In asking us to do this, he is asking us to disavow the mystery of the subjectivity40 of other humans and, therefore, the appreciation of the human experi- ence. In laying aside these dimensions of encounter, we may encourage the further evolution of the psychopath. "The hero of our age ... free from guilt, free from anxiety, he pursues his interests without compunction, manipulating others to reach his goals." He "... shamelessly and guiltlessly, with great charm and 'good intelli- gence' manipulates for his own interests."41 The malignant psychopath manipulates us precisely because he is acutely aware of the contingencies that operate upon us and we are not. For the psychopath, behavioral technology may be a godsend: it provides tools for swift and sure control of people and things, and it provides the rationale for artfully manipulating. The insides of humans-the hopes, agonies, doubts, joys-all the things that propel us to touch each other are excess baggage for him. For generations growing up under the aegis of behavioral technol- ogy and unresponsive to the relevance of guilt, interpersonal agonism, anxiety, and self-reflexiveness in human affairs, we may be</page><page sequence="11">398 Social Service Review designing a social matrix of mutual psychopathy-people manipulat- ing themselves and others to acquire, even hoard, the rewards avail- able. It really does not matter if the rewards are contingent on "good" or "ethical" behavior; in the technology lies the undoing. Science, Scientism, and the Experimental Method as Behavioral Paradigm Skinner and others of similar persuasion implore us to become more scientific. In particular, we must, they say, apply the scientific method to unraveling the skein of social order and individual conduct. In turn, we ask to what sort of science is Skinner referring? A model of causality in human affairs is the goal. The means are objectivity, rigor, quantification, and experiment as a way to generate principles of control of the natural world such as used by physical and natural scientists. Yet we might suggest that those bugaboos of the social learning laboratory-the ineffable, the subjective, the intuitive, the anthropomorphic-are now turning up in the pristine laboratories of the physicist, chemist, and biologist. Is Skinner therefore inviting us to a laboratory long abandoned by those who built it? Skinner seems not so far away from Robert Merton's Puritan scientist who, con- vinced of the absolute orderliness of the universe, recreated asceti- cism in the laboratory in order to bring salvation to a morally recalci- trant world,42 without recognizing that ascetism requires removal from the disturbing complexities of everyday life. Skinner is surely a technologist. He has created something and it works. He is a scientist as well. A disturbing question is: Is he a "scientian"? Malachi Martin says that in the modern longing for an- swers, the scientian emerges as one of a priesthood-he speaks with "... dogmatic absolutism, claimed omniscience, and mystic privilege."43 The scientist speaks tentatively, respects the limit and range of the phenomena under study and lets the data speak. The scientian uses his background ". . . to extrapolate the currently known data of his field-and, if necessary, the data of other branches of science-in order to discourse on the whole of man, including, specifically, ethics, morality, religious instinct and practice ... humanism, and all the so-called values-the 'inner' things of man.""44 According to Martin, the "scientian leap" from the laboratory to the social and moral order is unwarranted by the data but often justified by the fact that the scientian has uncovered "... the fly in the cosmic ointment, ..." in Skinner's case, the literatures of freedom and dignity.45</page><page sequence="12">Skinnerian Technology and the Welfare Society 399 A more serious problem, however, relates to the discussion above of malignant psychopathy and naive sociology. The name of the game in the laboratory is control and manipulation. The more elegant the experiment, the more pervasive the control and, in the case of human subjects, the more necessary the deception. The experimental paradigm is a theory-in-use, one that, in Argyris's view, an individual actually uses in interaction. If we were to observe him, though, he would be likely to report that some other theory informed his be- havior (a theory-in-action).46 The experimenter proceeds on the as- sumption that the experimental world can be totally controlled by him and that the behavior of subjects that emerges under conditions of such control is an accurate reflection of the behavior of subjects in the real world. The paradox of the laboratory (or the total institution) is that to insure "free choice" (that is, to insure that the subject can choose to behave in a way not hypothesized) the experimenter must deceive.47 He cannot reveal what is truly happening (e.g., Stanley Milgram48 cannot reveal that he is studying obedience to authority) nor can he allow the subject to realize that the experimental situation is not an egalitarian one but an authoritarian one. The ethical di- lemma is whether, in order to apply knowledge gained in the experi- mental laboratory, the same conditions must apply in the real world, and whether the theory-in-use of the laboratory must govern our day-to-day interactions and the politics of social reform. If this is the case, then it becomes clearer why Skinnerian technology has thus far had its greatest successes with animals, children, and institutionalized, powerless populations. If this is the case, the agony implicit in the literatures of freedom and dignity may be a better route than the autocratic manipulations of a social system as laboratory. Conclusion Skinnerian, radical behavioral technology offers the means for initiat- ing and testing social reconstruction of the kind implied by the vision of the Welfare Society. Experimentation on a small scale should prob- ably proceed. But such a developmental program should not be un- dertaken without the widest public knowledge and continuing evaluation-both ethical and empirical. John Sisk asserts that moralists and reformers depend to a large degree on limited or highly concentrated and focused information.49 Perhaps that is the appeal of Skinner's ideas. They obliterate the subtleties, subterfuges, and accidents that govern much of our lives. For this reason, experimental social reform based on this methodol-</page><page sequence="13">400 Social Service Review ogy must be undertaken only with circumspection and a high degree of skepticism. The essence of the reservations presented herein is that while the methodology may be of sufficient power to be a basis for alteration of the social world, it may have within it assumptions which do not permit the achievement of the "human-centered" institutions of the Welfare Society.

This is a very important point. Operant conditioning can be extremely effective with the use of nonmaterial reinforcers (such as verbal and nonverbal responses to behavior). Thus, we may come to the point where we have a rich lode of human reinforcers (response contingencies) in the midst of diminishing material resources. 36.

The most consistent and continuous behavior shaping seems to occur in institu- tional settings where the behavior shapers have all or most of the power-in schools, institutions for the retarded or mentally disturbed, or even in families-parents shap- ing the behavior of children. When it comes to relatively free adults, then contracting becomes an important element of behavior modification practice: this is not part of Skinner's paradigm. In a word, many of the successes have occurred in settings where it would seem hard to make an argument for the concomitant strengthening of counter- control (see, e.g., Teodor Ayllon and Norman Azrin, The Token Economy [New York: Appleton Century-Crofts, 1968]). 39.

For about ten years Stanley Milgram has conducted experiments in obedience to authority. The basic paradigm is that subjects, thinking they are participating in a study on the effects of punishment on learning, administer shocks of increasing voltage (they do not know the shocks are bogus) in a learner (actually a confederate of the experi- menter) every time he makes a mistake in learning sequences of words. The astonishing finding is the high percentage of people who go on to give what they think are real shocks to a very painful level, in spite of the protests of the learner, at the demand of the experimenter. 49.
