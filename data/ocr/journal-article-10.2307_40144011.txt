<plain_text><page sequence="1">Biblical Correspondences and Eschatological Questioning in the Metafiction of Murilo Rubiao The idea of an all-powerful divine being is present everywhere, if not consciously recognized, then unconsciously accepted.1 C. G. Jung To Frazer, magic is compulsion; religion is pro- pitiation; a combination of the two exists side by side since neither method proves fully successful alone ,2 Melville Jean Herskovits By ROBERT E. DiANTONIO Contemporary Brazilian fiction is beginning to receive the kind of critical attention that has previously been reserved for the "boom" years of Brazil's Spanish- speaking neighbors. Translations of important works are now internationally well received. Though not yet generating the kind of cult following enjoyed by a Garcia Marquez or a Vargas Llosa, Brazilian fiction is being intensely reviewed by professional scholars. Most recent Brazilian fiction is strongly couched in sociopolitical meaning. Writers such as Marcio Souza, Ivan Angelo, Joao Ubaldo Ribeiro, Roberto Drum- mond, Ignacio de Loyola Brandao, Luiz Vilela, and others have created a literature of international inter- est by seizing the meaning of a sociopolitical present and recasting it in transnationalized literary tech- niques. However, one very singular writer, Murilo Rubiao, has maintained a consistent tradition of undefinable personalism in his short fiction since the 1940s. His is a unique esthetic focus, related to the "metafictions" of Barth, Kafka, and Borges, but still richly framed in the writer's personal vision and concerns. It is generally the case that most discussions of Rubiao's works un- derscore the surrealistic or magically realistic qualities of his writings. His fantastic visions and magical worlds are usually alluded to and described, but very rarely is there an attempt to analyze the underlying oneiric logic and thematic unity in his fiction. A detailed exploration of two of Rubiao's famous stories - two pieces that lend their names to col- lections - may offer an insight into the fictional world view of one of Brazil's most original writers. The evolu- tionary philosophical focus that these two stories por- tray is an interesting one and worthy of further study. Bobby J. Chamberlain relates that Rubiao was born in Silvestre Ferraz, Minas Gerais, in 1916 and worked as a journalist, government bureaucrat, and commercial attache.3 O ex-mdgico (The Ex-Magician from the Minhota Tavern) was published in 1947; O pirotecnico Zacarias (Zacarias, the Pyrotechnist) came out in 1974. Although there exist parallels in style and structure, Rubiao's thematic and eschatological focus during the passing decades has altered dramatically. Raymond S. Sayers considers Rubiao "one of the two or three outstanding writers of fantastic fiction, a genre that occupies a strong place in modern Brazilian writing. "4 Sayers observes that Rubiao's characters are depersonalized and that there exists no real tension or empathy between reader and text. The reader "is forced to remain an outsider - that is precisely the effect which the author desires and which contributes to his originality. "5 Utilizing Sayers's reading of Rubi- ao's fiction as a point of departure, the present study calls attention to the seminal importance of these short narratives in the development of contemporary Bra- zil's postmodern antirealistic fiction. While underscor- ing the historical importance of this fiction, the study will also analyze Rubiao's use of biblical corre- spondences and inversions to tender an evolving vision of eternal eschatological questions. I The idea of creating or recasting a parallel religious text, one that complements and may run contrary to traditional theological thinking, is not new. In six- teenth-century Portugal and Spain there existed an abundance of ascetic and mystical writings: "Jewish religious thought has had two major . . . aspects. One has been that of down-to-earth rationalism repre- sented by the Talmud and its vast commentary litera- ture. The other has been that of mysticism embodied in the literature of the Cabala. While the Talmudists sought to apprehend God, wisdom, and righteousness by means of logic, the cabalists sought the same objec- tives by means of the 'hidden wisdom' and esoteric practices. . . . Denied the natural means for coping with reality they grasped at the magical. "6 Rubiao's fictive imagination constructs an ingenious parallel text that is, in essence, aparodistic inversion of important biblical motifs and themes. The biblical layer is especially strong in "The Ex- Magician from the</page><page sequence="2">DiANTONIO 63 Minhota Tavern." No element of Rubiao's fiction is extraneous. He is a conscious and deliberate artist. Elizabeth Lowe states that "Murilo Rubiao claims to have rewritten 'O Convidado' for twenty-six years/7 The author himself affirms, "I never worried about giving an end to my stories. Using ambiguity as a fictional means, I try to fragment my stories to the utmost to give the reader the certainty that they will go on indefinitely" (CBL, 196). Thus one must assume that the biblical correspondences are consciously planned and that the creation of a magical reality is not merely an end in itself. Lowe's reading of these works stresses the theme of "the sentence to infinite repeti- tion, or the condemnation to eternal life" (CBL, 149). Jorge Schwartz also highlights the "theme of the in- finite, rendered by repetitive and circular action, [which] reduces the alleged future to an eternal pres- ent. This, in turn, becomes the 'mask' of the Apoca- lypse" (CBL, 154). 8 The masterful aspect of Rubiao's minimalist and carefully constructed fiction is that it is accomplishing exactly what the author has stated that he intended to accomplish: "using ambiguity as a fic- tional means, " that is, to generate active reader partici- pation and critical interpretation. Theodore Ziolkowski, in discussing novelists like Gunter Grass, Gore Vidal, and John Barth in his book Fictional Transfigurations of Jesus, states: "It is hardly surprising to find a strong strain of parody in ... their . . . fictional transfiguration. . . . These sophisticated talents of the twentieth century with their jaded sensibilities, who know everything and have lost all naivete, must agree with this modern Faustian view that all the devices of art 'are suitable today only for parody.' "9 In the way that John Barth's Giles Goat- Boy "exploits the Bible for the sheer aesthetic fun of structural parody ' (FT], 257), Rubiao's fiction is a parodic analogue of biblical occurrences. However, Rubiao's use of fantasy and magicality has a deeper, more theological focus: a concern with the problemat- ics of eschatology. Rubiao's stories explore universal theological questions. Ziolkowski refers to "the vast neo-baroque splendor of Barth's zany cosmos ' (FTJ, 257); Rubiao's esthetic vision is anything but zany, for it is steeped in melancholy and anguish. He has cre- ated two companion pieces of short fiction wherein death has no finality and the central question - even though presented in an antirealistic and avant-garde manner - is the eternal relationship between the di- vine and the human. II Rubiao's fiction blurs the distinction between illu- sion and reality, magic and religion, the human and the divine. The God figure's realization of his eternal na- ture and the subsequent burden that this discovery causes form the axis upon which both pieces turn. The ex-magician comes into existence abruptly, and his miraculous genesis is depicted in flat, colloquial, and prosaic terms: "I found myself one day, with light gray hair, in the mirror of theMinhota Tavern, a discovery which in no way frightened me, any more than it astonished me to take the owner of the restaurant out of my pocket."10 The magician's story continues in a nar- ratively detached fashion. It consciously accommo- dates and exploits the creation myth. The story's tone inverts biblical hyperbole and grandiloquence, for this modern-day deity's manner is anything but godlike. Rubiao's story tenders important metaphysical ques- tions from the perspective of the God figure's inability to explain his capacity to create: "He, rather per- plexed, asked me how could I have done such a thing. What could I answer, given my situation, a person who lacked the least explanation for his presence in the world? " (EM, 109). This same ironically colloquial tone and an extreme openness of meaning is now found in much of the antirealistic fiction of Ignacio de Loyola Brandao, Moacyr Scliar, and Luiz Vilela: "I said to him that I was tired, that I was born tired and weary" (109). Rubiao's stories are tightly constructed analogues and purposefully vague allegories. A historical and sociopolitical dimension is added, as the magician is employed to entertain the customers at the very tavern where he was created: "So I began, from that time on, to entertain the clientele of the establishment with my magical activity " (EM, 109). In an overt accommoda- tion of Jesus's first manifestation of his divine power at the wedding feast at Cana, Rubiao burlesques the fact that in contemporary society the profit motive out- weighs religious revelation. The man himself, however, failed to appreciate my habit of offering onlookers a variety of free lunches, which I would mysteriously draw forth from the inside of my own jacket. Judging it to be not the best of transactions merely to increase the number of customers - without a corre- sponding growth in profits .... (EM, 109-10) The story continues to explore and exploit the brood- ing God figure's conception of himself. Although he possesses the ability to perform supernatural feats, he is not at peace, for he is envious of others: "Why be moved, though, if those innocent faces, destined to endure the suffering inflicted upon any man's coming of age, aroused no pity in me, much less any anger, over their having everything I longed for but did not myself possess: birth, and a past" (EM, 110). The contemporary irony of Rubiao's inverted mythic perspective is that the God figure is not presented as all-knowing and all-powerful but is instead as racked with self-doubts as his human counterparts. His pow- ers become a burden: "As I grew more popular, my life became intolerable " (EM, 110). He longs to put an end to all the attention that he continually receives. In an act of self-mutilation he decides to try to remove the source of his anguish: "On one of these occasions, completely furious, and resolved never again to prac- tice magic, I cut off my hands. To no purpose. As soon as I moved, they reappeared, fresh and perfect, on the ends of the stump of each arm! " (EM, 111). Having failed, he merely wishes to die: "I had to resolve my</page><page sequence="3">64 WORLD LITERATURE TODAY despair somehow. After weighing the matter carefully, I concluded that only death would put a proper end to my misfortune. " Rubiao then incorporates the motif of Daniel in the lions' den: "Steadfast in my decision, I took a dozen lions out of my pockets and, crossing my arms, waited for the moment when I would be de- voured. " Here even the lions are filled with a parallel sense of anguished ennui: " 'This world is tremendous- ly tedious,' they declared" (EM, 112). Upon learning this, the magician turns violent and slays them in a grotesque manner: "I failed to restrain my outright rage. I killed them all, and began to devour them myself. I had hopes of dying the victim of a fatal in- digestion. " The magician comes to realize that he is immortal; he can find no way to kill himself. Theologi- cal inversions and ironies are sharply drawn. I pulled the trigger, expecting a loud report and the pain of the bullet tearing through my head. There was no shot, and no death: the handgun turned into a pencil. I rolled to the floor, sobbing. I who could create other beings had no means to liberate myself from existence. (EM, 112) The story's most profanely ironic twist occurs as the magician-God figure finally does discover a means of dying, a quotidian form of death, so to speak: "From a sad man I heard that to be a civil servant was to commit suicide little by little. I was in no condition to de- termine which form of suicide was best suited to me: slow or quick. As a result, I took a job in the Depart- ment of State " (EM, 112). As in much Brazilian fiction, sociopolitical reality is viewed here with a fine sense of absurdist black humor: "1931 began cheerlessly, with threats of mass dismissals in our department and a refusal by the typist to consider my proposal. Faced with the possibility of being discharged, I tried some- how to look after my own interests" (EM, 113). Work, love, and friends are only "momentary distractions." The magician is still racked with anguish: "I struggle with uncertainties." However, he now wishes to re- main at his trivial job and reverts to magic, attempting to deceive his supervisor; yet, when he most needs his magic, when it is intrinsically important to him, it fails: "I was forced to admit defeat. I had trusted too much in my powers to make magic, which had been nullified by bureaucracy" (EM, 113). He now can only feign his "miraculous gift of wizardry." At the story's end he is left alone contemplating his existence: "Of course, the illusion gives me no comfort. It only serves to intensify my regret not to have created a total magical world" (EM, 114). The central symbols in Rubiao's fiction are color, light, and brilliance. Fireworks, seminally important as an emblem of divine presence and knowledge, also constitute a motif that is underscored in both pieces of short fiction. In a poignant soliloquy the magician la- ments his inability to cover the earth with magically polychromatic displays that emanate from his own being. He yearns for the love and attention of all men. In essence, he seeks the transcendence of divine affir- mation. At certain moments I imagine how marvelous it would be to extract red, blue, white, and green handkerchiefs from my body, fill the night with fireworks, turn my face to the sky and let a rainbow pour forth from my lips, a rainbow that could cover the earth from one extremity to the other. Then the applause from the old men with their white hair, and from gentle children. (EM, 114) The tale ends on this note of pathos, with the God figure dreaming of radiant transcendental displays of color. Rubiao's story evolves as an inverted spiritual quest, a theological enigma in which both God and man suffer and dream of revelation within the "Keno- ma," the nonplace of emptiness. Ill It is possible to view Murilo Rubiao's fictional world as an esthetic continuance of the absurdist and antilogi- cal elements that were contained in the novels of Mario de Andrade and Oswaldo de Andrade. His fantasist's imagination has also inspired and influenced younger writers, laying the groundwork for the popularity of the Brazilian absurdist antinovel. In essence, his fic- tional poetics have expanded existing Brazilian literary traditions while remaining firmly rooted in the col- lective spirit of the absurd that has constituted such a strong world view from colonial times to the present. His narrative obsession with metaphysical issues, the offhand, colloquial, and ironic presentation of his sto- ries, and his characters' comic-strip thinness and quasi-allegorical nature are all antecedents of such present-day novels as Ignacio de Loyola Brandao's Zero. Rubiao's serious metaphysical musings are pre- sented in an absurdist narrative form. Inverted biblical motifs evolve as contemporary "cabalistic" enigmas filled with magic, mystically ambiguous meaning, and evanescent flashes of pure metaphysical illuminations.</page><page sequence="4">DiANTONIO 65 In his essay "The Christian Novel Now' Peter S. Prescott observes, "One need not profess the faith to recognize the mythic structure that Christian themes can lend a narrative, or the fine opportunities for moral perplexity that they afford/'11 Within the fictive world that Rubiao creates are the stirrings of the "metafic- tional vogue " that was to occur some twenty years after the publication of "O ex-magico." It was Robert Scholes and William Gass who defined the term meta- fiction. Gass, the American philosopher, critic, and novelist, points out metafiction's affinity to anti- literature. The use of philosophical ideas in the construction of fictional works - in a very self-conscious and critical way, I mean - has been hastened by the growing conviction that not only do these ideas often represent conceptual sys- tems of considerable complexity, they have the further advantage of being almost wholly irrelevant as accounts of the real world. They are, that is, to a great degree fictional already, and ripe for fun and games. . . . Indeed, many of the so-called antinovels are really metafictions.12 The more recent of the two narratives, "Zacarias, the Pyrotechnist," begins, as do all of Rubiao's stories, with a biblical epigraph, in this case from the Book of Job (11:17): "And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday; thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning star "13 (EM, 87). Job, a contemporary em- blem of suffering and anguish, gives voice to his strong faith in God and the future. His vision of divine revela- tion is expressed by the symbol of intense light. In The Art of Biblical Narrative (1981) the critic Robert Alter, while discussing the historical interweaving of biblical events and characters, states, "The only evident ex- ceptions to the rule are [Jonah and] Job, which in its very stylization seems manifestly a philosophic fable (hence the rabbinic dictum, 'There was no such crea- ture as Job; he is a parable')."14 Rubiao's approach to his fiction is very much in the fabulist's tradition. He creates characters and situations that fall outside the realm of objective reality. His is a distorted, fantastical vision which his readers explore with the dedication of the ancient cabalists. With the centrality of the symbology of light es- tablished, the story of Zacarias begins. The tension in the work is created from the opening query: "Rare is the occasion when, in conversations among friends of mine or people of my acquaintance, this question doesn't arise: was the pyrotechnist Zacarias actually dead?" (EM, 87). Zacarias recounts the events of his physical death. However, in death life continues. A physical paradox is tendered, and an enigmatic fiction- al game is set in motion: "The individual whom they persist in calling Zacarias is nothing but a tormented soul wrapped in some pitiable human garb"; "To live, to get muscles good and tired, walking along streets filled with people, empty of men" (EM, 87, 89). As in the work of Clarice Lispector, every element in Rubiao's polished fictions is conceived with endless care. His selection of the name "Zacarias" evokes the figure of the biblical priest of the same name (Luke 1:5-67, 3:2), who was struck dumb by the angel Ga- briel for his skepticism. He recovers his speech as his son John the Baptist is born; at that moment he praises God in an effusive blessing often referred to as the Benedictus. Another overt use of symbolism is the choice of the name "Acaba-Mundo Road" (End-of-the- World Road). The apocalyptic connotation here is also employed to convey biblical resonance instantly. After Zacarias's (non)death, life's sensual pressures continue: female companionship, alcohol, and particu- larly the presence of color. Zacarias calls his love of light and color a "polychromatic delirium," stating, "I never want to live without color" (EM, 89). As the months pass, he grows to accept his state. With physic- al death comes an awakening and a deepening of expe- riences. He now endures a heightened sense of an- guish and compassion for all men. His anxiety also includes concern for his present state of being. Only one thought really troubles me: what events will fate hold in store for a dead man, if the living breathe such agonizing lives? And my anxiety increases on sensing, in all its fullness, how my capacity to love, to discern things, is far superior to that of the many who pass me by so fearfully. (EM, 92-93) In what can only be described as a very uncustomary vision for a contemporary writer, Rubiao's narrative concludes, not on an anguished note, but with the hopeful vision that was reflected in the opening quote from the Book of Job. The ending is affirmative and joyous, one that is somewhat unexpected in a splenetic age of predominantly alienated writings. Still, a clear day might dawn tomorrow, the sun brilliant as never before. And at such an hour men may come to realize that, even on the margin of life, I am still alive, because my existence has been transmuted into colors, and whiteness is already drawing close to the earth, to the exclusive delight of my eyes. (EM, 93) Rubiao brings together these two pieces of short fiction under the unifying images of light and color. The ex-magician, who two decades earlier lamented his inability to cover the earth with a rainbow of color, is fictionally reincarnated in the character of Zacarias, who "can not live without color." Zacarias, at work's end, attains an anthropomorphic diffusion of his being into cosmic and Divine Light. Though much contemporary literary criticism uti- lizes the term apocalyptic in the sense of a highly negative warning, the term in its original Greek mean- ing of "disclosure" or "revelation" in a positive sense is applicable to Rubiao's metafiction. "Zacarias, the Pyrotechnist" prefigures the power and sensuous splendor of the Book of Revelation. Like Saint John before the blinding light of the New City descending to earth, Zacarias senses an existence in which his being will be "transmuted into colors." The intense rapture, delight, and hope of the Book of Revelation mirror the narrative's final paragraph: "I am still alive . . . the sun</page><page sequence="5">66 WORLD LITERATURE TODAY brilliant as never before ... a clear day might dawn tomorrow . . . whiteness is already drawing close to the earth" (EM, 93). Rubiao is consciously constructing a correspondence with one of the worlds most beautiful and influential pieces of literature in order to convey his contemporary gospel of hope. Murilo Rubiao's prose evolves as an existential rethinking of man's place in the universe. He attempts to engender a new fiction, one which continually seeks to define the unique nature of contemporary man's existence. He has moved beyond the now cliche- ridden concept of the encounter with nothingness to a metaphysical stance that stresses a strong element of faith. However, it is difficult to equate the metaphysi- cal impulses in Rubiao's writings to any traditional concept of religion. His metafictions ask readers to coparticipate actively in the creative process. Through his conscious and lyric accommodation of biblical cor- respondences, he imparts to his narrative resonances of the universal literary experience, what Coleridge calls "the film of familiarity." In "Zacarias, the Pyrotechnist " he employs these correspondences to convey, in magically poetic terms, a hopeful vision of contemporary man's eschatological situation.
