So did his wife, his children, and his father before him. For three generations, their cattle grazed by ancient pit houses surrounded by neat lines of rocks marking prehistoric property lines. The children played near perfectly preserved rock-art paintings. White and amber colored stone tools carved by a mysterious Native American tribe lay scattered on the ground. While the Wilcoxes kept mum, the ruins remained safe, hidden on a remote 4,000- acre ranch called Range Creek. Though the nearest paved road is an hour away, Wilcox put up gates and "road closed" signs just in case pot hunters learned of the artifacts lit- tering the ranch. "It did not belong to us. If those people wanted to leave their things there, I thought we should leave them alone," says Wilcox, sit- ting in a chair under a stuffed head of a bighorn sheep that hangs on the wall of his mobile home in Green River, Utah, about an hour south of his old ranch. He wears bat- tered jeans and scuffed gray cowboy boots. When he tells stories of Range Creek, he flashes a big white grin. 40</page><page sequence="2">s s CL Ü 4 3 Í Û. Ou &lt; In the past few years Wilcox decided he was too old to care for Range Creek, so after long negotiations he sold it to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) for $2.5 million. It was then that the Wilcox family secret was revealed: Range Creek holds some of the purest archaeological evidence of the mysterious and enigmatic Fremont Indians, a Great Basin culture that thrived for more than a thousand years. Currently Range Creek is overseen by Corinne Springer, an archaeologist from the Utah Museum of Nat- ural History at the University of Utah. This spring she moved into Waldo Wilcoxs forfner ranch home, a small house nestled in a shady spot and surrounded by some of the most spectacular scenery in the world. The awesome 9,000-foot-tall Book Cliff Mountains that surround Springers house look like they were carved by an eccentric sculptor who piled boulders atop narrow pillars of rock. ! "There are so many sites here, and most are undis- turbed/' says Springer. "Range Creek is a microcosm of the Fremont world." Archaeologists estimate that several small communities of farmers and foragers lived at Range Creek 1 ,000 years ago, about the same time the Anasazi inhabited the Four Corners area some 300 miles to the south. The ruins are perhaps the best cared-for record of the Fremont Indians that exists. No excavations have begun yet, but archaeolo- gists are working on documenting the approximately 300 sites that exist at the ranch. Renee Barlow, an assistant professor of anthropology at Salt Lake Community College and one of the main field researchers at Range Creek, says that as of the summer of 2004, archaeologists have found four pit house villages with five to 12 structures each, 16 individual pit houses, 50 sites with rock-art petroglyphs, www.archaeology.org 4i</page><page sequence="3">A 1,500-year-old bison-leather moccasin still holds the shape of a Fremont Indian foot.

Human remains have also been found on land near Range Creek and have caused controversy among Native American groups in the region. The Skull Valley Band of Goshute Indians, the Paiute tribe, and the Shoshone all claim to be descendants of the Fremont. Under the Native American Graves Pro- tection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), federal agencies are required to return certain Native American cultural items, including human remains, to liheal descendants or culturally affiliated Indian tribes. Although archaeologists hesitate to discuss the human remains, they emphasize they have not moved or excavated them. Still, their fate remains of concern to many Native Americans. "We want the remains left in place. Our belief is when you pray and sing over a burial, we believe it is given over to the care of the Creator. Human beings do not have the right to take that back," says Melvin Brewster, an archaeol- ogist and member of the Northern Paiute tribe who is also the tribal historic preservation officer for the Skull Valley Band of Ghosute Indians. "This is boiling down to a fight between spirituality and science." Archaeologists have not reached a clear agreement on how the Fremont fit in with Native American history. Unlike the more famous Anasazi, the builders of the archi- tecturally astonishing great houses in Chaco Canyon, little is known about the Fremont. There is no written record of the culture and no record of early explorers meeting them. By the time early Mormon pioneers arrived in Utah, the Fremont had disappeared as a unique cultural group. Many of the sites that contained evidence of them were built over by settlers or looted by relic hunters. Any informa- tion we have about them has to be deciphered by looking at the artifacts collected from remaining Fremont sites. In many ways, the Fremont offer the purest type of archaeology that can be practiced, says archaeologist David Madsen, who has spent more than 25 years studying the culture and wrote the book Exploring the Fremont . "You are left looking at rocks and baskets, and from that you can get a lot of different information, but that information can be interpreted in many different ways," he says. Interpreting and understanding the enigmatic Fremont is even more compli- cated because they were not one clearly defined group. First described by the late Harvard researcher Noel Morss in 1931, the Fremont get their name from the Fremont Drainage basin in south-central Utah, because evidence of their dis- tinct culture was found nearby. But not all Fremont com- munities lived the same lifestyle. Some relied more on hunting and gathering, while others raised crops. "We label them as 'Fremont/ but there is no easy way to define them," says Madsen. "Fremont is not one unitary set of people. They are loosely related family groups." Archaeologists debate when the culture began, but most agree the height of the Fremont period was around A.D. 1000. Within 500 years of their peak, they had disap- peared. Archaeologists determine where the Fremont lived by their artifacts: unique gray pottery, broad-shouldered clay figurines, single-rod-and-bundle woven baskets, moc- casins made from deer or sheep hide (unlike the Anasazi, who made yucca sandals), and dramatic rock-art figures with elaborate headdresses. Of all the artifacts, the pottery is the most durable and therefore the most common. While most early Southwest- ern cultures decorated their pottery with paints and dyes, the Fremont also used texture to decorate their gray ware. An oval appliqué garlands the outside of some jars; checkerboard patterns and half-moon shapes, carved with fingernails, are found on others. The Fremont pottery has been found as far east as Grand Junction, Colorado, as far west as Ely, Nevada, and as far north as Pocatello, Idaho. (Glade Hadden, a BLM archaeologist, has proposed - somewhat controversially - that he has found Fremont pottery at a site in south-central Montana, far outside of the known Fremont range.) They also used gray clay to make fig- urines, but these were not fired and there- fore very fragile, making them rare in the archaeological record.

The broad-shoul- dered dolls are about six inches tall and shaped like a trape- zoid with a head on top. From the dolls, archaeologists have inferred that women wore aprons and styled their hair in bobs, while the men wore loin cloths. Dolls of both sexes sported necklaces, and some have stripes painted on their faces, indicating the Fremont may have worn face paint. They also left behind tantalizing clues to their culture in their stunning rock-art paintings. Like the figurines, the rock art anthropomorphic figures often have broad shoul- ders and sometimes wear necklaces. They often have horns or headdresses that look like antlers, feet that stick out, and splayed fingers. The rock art was painted with red hematite, yellow ochre, and white mineral pigments that bonded to the rock, making it still visible after a tfiousand years. At Range Creek, there are bright-red rock-art panels, and paintings of triangular anthropomorphs with animals nearby. Polly Schaafsma, an archaeologist who has studied rock art for 30 years and is the author of Rock Art of Utah , thinks the paintings may depict supernatural or shamanistic figures. In the Vernal, Utah, area there are also Fremont rock paintings of figures holding human heads, which she says fits in with a shamanistic tradition of rock art going on for thousands of years on the Colorado Plateau. "It is one of the more interesting rock-art traditions we have because it is so bold, and the rock art is one of the more informative aspects of the culture. It gives you a sense of what people are thinking about their place in the landscape," says Schaafsma. The steep, rugged landscape shaped the life of the Fre- mont at Range Creek. Like at other Fremont sites, archae- ologists at Range Creek have discovered rock art, pottery, and pit houses at all heights of the mountains. Obtaining water must have been difficult, and other dangers lurked. "Imagine living on a ledge like that, and worrying about your children falling off," says Springer, pointing upward toward mountain cliffs where five pit houses are well hidden. From the outside these pit houses would have looked like large mounds of mud, but inside they had seven-foot- high ceilings. Posts supported the roof and provided struc- tural sturdiness. A hearth would have kept the house warm. "The pit houses were very well insulated," says Kevin Jones, Utahs state archaeologist. "Insulation was impor- tant because they dealt with harsh cold winters and hot summers." Intriguingly, the Fremont also stored their food in bizarre and difficult-to-reach locations. In Range Creek, for example, granaries were built into the sides of cliffs more than 100 feet above the ground. Inside these grana- ries, archaeologists found three maize cobs they radiocar- bon dated to about 1,000 years ago. The granaries were well hidden: The reddish clay they were made from served as perfect camouflage in the sandstone mountains. "I think it looks like they hid their granaries because they were worried about other people coming and stealing their food," says Barlow.

But Brewster, who incorporates Native American oral tradition into traditional archaeological research, thinks the granaries were used to make spiritual offerings. Because they weren't used for food storage, he says, they didn't need to access them very often and so built them in more remote places. The Fremont lived throughout Utah's varying regions - rugged mountains, remote deserts, and dense forests - and had to adjust to unpredictable weather patterns. Because the length of the growing season varies, crops were often supple- mented with food from hunting and gathering. In addition to farming maize, the Fremont may have gathered pine nuts, currants, and yucca, which still grow wild at Range Creek. Rock- J art depictions of deer and bighorn sheep lead archaeologists to believe these were the animals they hunted. rremont artifacts begin to disappear around A.D. 1250, and archaeologists aren't sure why. "As long as people have been studying the Fremont, what hap- pened to them has always been one of the key questions," says Madsen. "You can speculate endlessly, but we just don't know." At that time there was some sort of global cli- mate shift, sometimes called the Little Ice Age, that most likely manifested itself at Range Creek as a drought that made farming more difficult and increased competition for resources. Some archaeologists think the Fremont may have just reverted to hunting and gathering to adapt to the new cli- mate. Yet that alone would not explain their disappearance, because they had adapted to other climate changes in the past, says Madsen. Archaeologists who have studied linguis- tic data from the Numic-speaking Paiute, Goshute, and Shoshone tribes have determined that around the same time, their ancestors started migrating from California into the entire Great Basin area, including the Fremont region. Whether the Fremont were incorporated into the tribes that moved into the area, or whether they were enslaved or killed, generates much controversy among scholars. "If the Fremont were peacefully absorbed, you would see some sort of cultural continuity, but the culture disap- peared," says Madsen. Local Native American groups disagree. They say the Fremont were assimilated into their tribes. "The word for Fremont in Goshute is nuwenucyu , and that means our ancestor.' And I believe the word for Fremont in northern Ute is mookweetchnutsiyu , and that also means our ances- tor,"' says Brewster. He sees cultural continuity between Fremont moccasins, ceramics, and coiled baskets and those of later, Numic-speaking peoples. Brewster is concerned about the way archaeologists have been conducting research at Range Creek. "I call their research anti-Numic. If they don't understand the gray area and they can't explain something, then they don't think it exists, but the answer we are looking for is in that gray area." Both Brewster and the archaeologists at Range Creek are hoping further study of the site will help resolve these tensions. Archaeologists have met with Native Ameri- can groups recently and both have agreed to work together more closely. Stone tools and obsidian flakes that were found at Range Creek may help to answer what happened to the Fremont. The tools would have been used to butcher food. Interestingly, the tools come from stone that is not native to the area, says Springer, but its source has yet to be identified. She believes the Fremont may have traded goods for the stone. But what did they trade, and with whom? Further study of the Range Creek site, fiercely guarded by a lone cattle-ranching family for half a century, may further illuminate how this mysterious cul- ture lived - and why it disappeared. "The problem with the Fremont is, people are still trying to figure out what the culture is," says Schaafsma. "There is a still lot of debate and discussion. 'Fremont' is a great pot to throw everything into, but there is still a lot more to learn." ■ Melissa Sanford, a freelance journalist based in Salt Lake City, Utah, regularly writes for The New York Times and produces news segments for CBS.
