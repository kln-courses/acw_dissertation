Brennan Geological Survey of Historical Cemeteries, Jamestown, Rhode Island, 1693-1900 ABSTRACT Studies of historical burial practices may be hindered by the effects of weathering on gravemarkers. A survey of nine historical-period cemeteries on Conanicut Island, Jamestown, Rhode Island, examined the variety of stone types used in gravestone construction between the 17th and 19th centuries. The focus of this study is the date, rock type, and graphic design of the headstone markers, in order to develop a pattern of stone use on the island. The results of the cemetery survey illustrate the shift from slate to marble gravestones during the 19th century. A combination of rock type and design attributes is applied to give rough dates to historical-cemetery headstones that have become illegible due to weathering. Introduction Gravestones are particularly susceptible to weathering and can be difficult to protect in situ or restore. This degradation can cause problems for studies of historical burial practices. After centuries of ongoing erosion, what often remains is only the stone itself. This report analyzes nine historical-period cemeteries in Jamestown, Rhode Island, on Conanicut Island in Narragansett Bay. A similar study to examine degrees of weather ing documented by the conditions of historical gravestones was conducted in northeastern Ohio (Bauer et al. 2002). As in that study, rock types were recorded by date of death, where legible, in order to develop a pattern of stone-use seriation for headstones of the 17th through 19th centuries. The goal of this study was to establish visual identifications of the stone types commonly used for headstones in these cemeteries and determine their distribution through time. Petrographic anal ysis of a small number of chips from weathered sections of headstones was also conducted in a few cases to confirm the visual identification. By linking rock type to known headstone design patterns and stone-carving techniques, this study will help provide a framework for the relative dating of illegible gravestones. This study also relates to the distribution of stone acquisition in New England during the late 17th through 19th centuries. Jamestown Historical Cemeteries The earliest gravestones in Jamestown are Quaker and often unmarked (Miner 2004). Much of the research on historical cemeteries in early New England has been art historical, focusing on the carving patterns of various stonecutters to determine styles, patterns, and distribution of materials (Dethlefsen and Deetz 1966; Deetz and Dethlefsen 1967, 1971; Luti 2002). A number of questions regarding both unmarked stones in the Jamestown cemeteries, as well as the sources of the rock materials from which they were carved, remain. The John Stevens shop in New port, Rhode Island, at which a good number of the headstones in Jamestown were carved, does not have historical records documenting rock sources. It is possible early headstone materials came to the island as ballast on ships (Nicholas Benson 2007, pers. comm.). Such records would aid diachronic stone-use studies. Forbes (1967) examined ships' ladings from the 17th and 18th centuries, and found no mention of gravestones or uncut rock. While it is commonly thought that some slate was imported from England, there was little need to do so, given its widespread pres ence in New England, especially in the Narragan sett Basin (Forbes 1967). Local rock was used in the later 18th century, but as the use of marble increased, the number of stone sources expanded to include many places in New England (Ludwig 1975). Early stones in Jamestown are made from a variety of slates ranging from bluish black to silvery gray in color. Dethlefsen and Deetz's classic studies of colonial New England cemeteries examined local headstone design variations over time as a func tion of religious practice (Deetz and Dethlefsen 1965, 1967, 1971; Dethlefsen and Deetz 1966). Early gravestones were not carved by stonecutter specialists but by local farmers, and therefore Historical Archaeology, 2011, 45(4): 102-114. Permission to reprint required.

BRENNAN—Geological Survey of Historical Cemeteries, Jamestown, Rhode Island, 1693-1900 103 did not travel far from where they were carved. Stone carving only became a fulltime specialty in the early 19th century. Before this, Dethlefsen and Deetz argue, nearly all headstones in New England were fashioned from local slate; once stonecutting became specialized, carvers began to make the effort to acquire material from farther away (Dethlefsen and Deetz 1966). Dethlefsen and Deetz identified three basic designs for the eastern Massachusetts area: death's head, cherub, and urn and willow. The first appears on the oldest headstones and fea tures a winged skull, becoming increasingly simplified through time (Dethlefsen and Deetz 1966; Veit 2009). The cherub, depicting a human face with wings, common in the later 18th century, becomes more anthropomorphic over time. Finally, the urn-and-willow design appears on headstones from around the turn of the 19th century; it signals the end of the slate stone tradition in Massachusetts, as well as a turn toward less-personalized designs (Dethlefsen and Deetz 1966). In Newport, Rhode Island, the John Stevens shop was founded in 1705 and was at the fore front of the stonecutting business. John Stevens I used designs similar to those defined for the Boston area, including the standard Puritan symbols of mortality in the death's heads with Roman capital lettering (Garman 2006). Ste vens's sons, John II and William, took over the business, followed by John Stevens III, who carved in Newport until the early 19th century. Philip Stevens, the third son of John Stevens III, inherited the business in the 1820s, beginning his career using slate materials and copperplate let tering (Garman 2006). Philip switched to marble around 1845 when the quarries in Vermont opened, marble replacing slate as the principal material for headstones. He also experimented with other designs, using willows, urns, and other romantic-period motifs until his death in 1866 (Hall 2005). Philip's sons, Lysander and Edwin, took over the shop, running it into the 20th century. From Newport the John Stevens shop exported carved headstones as far as eastern Connecticut after 1750 (Ludwig 1975). The Stevens family is thought to have acquired black slate for its earlier headstones from a local quarry (Ludwig 1975; Garman 2006). A receipt from June 1726 shows that the Stevenses purchased a load of undressed blank headstones for carving from a man named Brayton (Ludwig 1975:330). Few records exist and source locations are uncertain; the nearest known slate quarry, however, is in North Attle boro, Massachusetts (Ludwig 1975). According to Luti (2002), design patterns and carving styles can be attributed to different stonecutters by type and stylistic elements. Toward the end of the career of John Stevens I in the 1720s, he was still using black slate. This stone was exclusive to the Stevens shop from 1705 to 1724 (Luti 2002). Other, softer slates were used in the 1730s, but after a few decades John Stevens II returned to black slate, which is thought to be finer grained and more durable (Luti 2002). A similar mix of black slate and other fine-grained metamorphic rock is seen in the Jamestown cemeteries for the headstones dating to the 18th century. None of the black slate headstones carved by John Stevens I appear in Jamestown, however. Unfortunately, Luti's work does not consider the 19th century, to which a large number of the Jamestown headstones date. John Bull, an apprentice of William Stevens, broke his indenture in 1751 and began carving on his own. Most of Bull's early work does not appear in Newport but is more common around Taunton, Massachusetts (Luti 2002). Bull's later headstones, especially those dating after 1764, appear commonly in Newport. Many of his carvings are clearly influenced by the work of the Stevenses, and in the later period of his career he uses the black slate that the Stevens shop had exclusively carved in the 1720s. One of John Bull's headstones is that of Captain John Eldred, who was buried in 1784 in the Friends' Cemetery in Jamestown (Luti 2002). Eldred is among the Revolutionary War heroes buried in the Friends' Cemetery (Lippincott 1980; Miner 2004). His headstone is carved from black slate and features a cherub design with carved side panels. Methods Geologic Survey of Jamestown Cemeteries There are 12 cemeteries in Jamestown; 9 of these, with gravestones dating to the time period under study, were surveyed in April 2007 (Figure 1).

BRENNAN—Geological Survey of Historical Cemeteries, Jamestown, Rhode Island, 1693-1900 105 and macroscopic rock type were recorded. The focus of this study included slate and marble headstones, restricting the applicable date range to before 1900. Rock type was identified based on appearance and weathering patterns, color, mineralogy, and spalling patterns. Various types of slate are evident to the naked eye, including black slate and phyllite, the latter of which gives headstones a silver sheen due to the presence of graphite. In some cases, visual identification was confirmed with petrographic analysis to character ize the specific mineralogy of the rock types used in these historical cemeteries. Although this study recorded variations in all rock types over time in these cemeteries, it primarily focused on the slate stones because these are the gravestones that are most com monly found to be illegible. Friends' Cemetery contains the greatest number of slate stones in the sample universe. This cemetery was mapped using a datum run east-west down the length of the plot. Rock types and burial dates were noted for each headstone (Figure 2). Only headstones with dates were recorded for the map; illegible headstones were counted and the stone type was noted. Information from footstones was not recorded to avoid duplicate counts. Petrographic Analysis Permission was obtained from the Cedar Cem etery Company in Jamestown, Rhode Island, to conduct a petrographic analysis of a small set of gravestones at Friends' Cemetery. Four headstones were sampled in November 2007 by carefully removing small chips of stone. The slatey cleav age of these rocks aided the sampling procedure, as weathering processes spall off flakes along cleavage planes. Sampled headstones include one phyllite headstone with an urn motif dating to 1829, a black-slate footstone dating to 1784, and two gray-slate headstones dating to 1787 and 1808, respectively, the former with a cherub design. The four samples were sent to Vancouver GeoTech Labs for thin sectioning on 27 x 46 mm glass slides. Optical petrographic analysis was con ducted at the University of Rhode Island, Graduate School of Oceanography, with a Zeiss Axioskop 40 polarizing microscope. These data were used to help identify the mineralogy and metamorphic grade of the stone types in an effort to confirm the visual identifications. Results Jamestown Historical Cemeteries The nine Jamestown cemeteries exhibited a range in the types of rock used for the headstones, as well as in the types of headstone designs. Table 1 lists the range of dates for gravestones at each cemetery up to 1900 and the numbers of head stones of each rock type and design. The cem eteries with the oldest headstones, including Gov ernor Carr Lot, Arnold Lot, Cedar Cemetery, and Friends' Cemetery have a large percentage of slate stones. Later cemeteries, such as Cottrell-Green Cemetery and Hazard Lot, have marble headstones predominantly. Phyllite headstones appear at a few cemeteries, but are represented primarily at Friends' Cemetery. Table 2 shows the headstone counts for rock type vs. design, illustrating the temporal change between the two. Few death's head motifs are present at these cemeteries, but those that were documented as part of this survey, as well as all of the cherub motifs, are on slate stones. All of the single-urn motifs were found on phyllite headstones, while the urn-and-willow motif appears on both phyllite and marble stones. The Cottrell-Green Cemetery has only marble gravestones, none of which feature "Puritan" designs. One headstone from 1876, however, has a Masonic symbol. The transitions between rock types and design styles will be discussed below. Significantly, this study identified a large number of broken and illegible headstones in many of these cemeteries, the counts of which are listed in Table 3. The northeast corner of Town Cemetery and the northwest section of Friends' Cemetery have areas of slate headstones that are either broken or were originally made as small, uncarved markers. These headstones are in basic alignment with the more intact markers, and all are slate; both cemeteries have one illegible stone that appears to be phyllite. All nine cemeteries also have a handful of intact, carved gravestones that are too badly weathered to read. Twelve of these are marble, four are phyl lite, and four are slate. The marble is susceptible to chemical weathering of the carbonate minerals, while the foliated cleavage of the slate and phyl lite are damaged by mechanical weathering of the rock. Engravings on the headstones made from black slate are in near-pristine condition, in part because fine-grained rocks are less susceptible to weathering (Bauer et al. 2002).</page><page sequence="5">106 HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY 45(4) 1843 184518781858 1835 1840 183918431855 1861 1870 1953 □ Friends'Cemetery JM006 Jamestown, Rl - Coriariicut Island M.Brennan May 2008 h H 1745 1745174917841787 1825 1830 1831 1852 1 860 igQg □ l7T?i7q? 1776 1785 179017981831 1810 1826 18371863 18831877 1895 1903 1882 18741867 l/JZ I' i—1 □ □ □ □ □ □ HP C=3C=3C=I C=] □ □ □ 1738 18481875 1850 1848 1855 1830 1811 1821 1829 1835184218461847 n.d. 1834 □ 1798 1800 1816 1840 1800 1813 1822 18231837 n.d. 1831 17431754176017601762 1792 1796 1800 1809 1814 18101847 1858 18081813 1825 1£2718|61838 18381840 FIGURE 2.

This study focused on this cemetery due to the concentration of slate headstones at this location. Figure 2 shows the distribution of legible headstones found in Friends' Cemetery. The earliest headstones, the majority of which date to the mid-1700s, are located in the north west corner of the cemetery, an area that also includes a number of unmarked stones. One broken stone is dated 1693, which is the earliest legible date found in any of the cemeteries in Jamestown and is probably a reburial, given that it predates the cemetery's establishment (Miner 2004). This lot is located west of the southern part of Cedar Cemetery, separated from it by a stone wall, and is adjacent to the Hazard Lot. The Quakers built this cemetery next to what is believed to be the original place of their meetinghouse, in the empty southeast area of the lot (Miner 2004). The cemetery markers are aligned in east-west rows with the head laid to the west, which is the direction the inscrip tions face. Some areas can be identified as family rows or plots, including the Knowles, Weeden, Eldred, Howland, Carr, Fowler, and Hull families. Of the 95 legible headstones in the cemetery, 49 indicate the graves of females and 46 of males. There is also an indication of military rank on some headstones, including Capt. John Eldred, Capt. Henry Fowler, Capt. John Carr, and Dam aris, daughter of Capt. John Hazzard. Eldred and Damaris's stones are made of black slate, and the other two of phyllite. Stones cut by the John Stevens shop are well represented at Friends' Cemetery, with 33 headstones ranging in date from 1760 (by John Stevens II) through 1855 (by Philip Stevens &amp; Sons), and one stone by John Stevens III from 1798, signed with his initials. Stonecutter signatures are still visible on some of the headstones, primarily those pro duced by Philip Stevens. His signature, either: P. Stevens or P. S., appears on 14 headstones, half of which are marble and half phyllite. The headstones carved by Philip Stevens range in date from 1829 to 1855. Four other stonecutters' signatures are visible on one headstone each: A. T. Farnum and Co. Prov., S. Brooks Prov., H. Bull, and Cooley. More inscriptions may survive on those headstones that have subsided into the ground, obscuring inscriptions at the base of the stone. Geology The geological survey and petrographic analy sis identified the slate rock of the headstones as fine-grained, low-grade metamorphic rocks of the greenschist facies. These rocks contain minerals including quartz, chlorite, muscovite, epidote, and albite (Nesse 2000). The black slate headstone from 1784 consists of a very fine-grained quartz matrix with small epidote needles and magnetite grains, which give it a dark color. The two gray-slate headstones sampled from 1787 and 1808 are comprised of a quartz and muscovite matrix with epidote inclusions. The last sample was taken from a phyllite headstone dating from 1829. This rock, like the others, consists of a micaceous quartz</page><page sequence="8">MICHAEL L. BRENNAN—Geological Survey of Historical C matrix and contains inclusions of graphite, albite, and magnetite. The silvery sheen of the rock and the elongated grains suggest that it may represent the higher-grade metamorphism characteristic of the phyllite end of slates. Phyl lites are characterized by their foliation and alignment of elongated platy minerals, such as micas and graphite, which give this stone its sil very sheen (Nesse 2000). Coarser-grained rocks are more diagnostic for the purposes of sourc ing because such low-grade rocks are common in the northeastern United States and parts of Europe. The geologic formations on Conanicut Island are higher-grade metamorphic rocks than those found in these cemeteries. Discussion This visual survey of Jamestown's historical cemeteries reveals a pattern of stone use that can be used to provide date estimates for head stones now illegible due to weathering. Figures 3 and 4 show the temporal change in stone use in Jamestown cemeteries and the Friends' Cemetery, respectively. There is an overlap in rock types, but it is clear that marble gradu ally replaced slates as the preferred stone for cutting. A preference for the silvery phyllite appears in the early 19th century. Nearly all of the examples of this rock type, however, are from the Friends' Cemetery; the few other examples include one at Cedar Cemetery, one at Town Cemetery, and two each at Arnold Lot and Tew Cemetery. The five headstones of this rock type from Town Cemetery, Arnold Lot, and Tew Cemetery are illegible. This slightly larger-grained, higher-grade metamorphic rock was likely chosen for its appearance more than for its ease of cutting, and was used in Friends' Cemetery even though marble was available. Cedar Cemetery was not opened until 1861 (Miner 2004). During the time period when phyllite headstones appear in Friends' Cem etery, 1798-1848, the contemporaneous head stones that are currently located in Cedar Cemetery were moved to this location from the Watson Lot farther south on Narragansett Avenue when that cemetery was closed in 1883 (Rhode Island Cemeteries Database 2000). These headstones were recorded as part of Cedar Cemetery, but most of the headstones can be identified as those with the name neteries, Jamestown, Rhode Island, 1693-1900 109 "Watson," and all of these are made from marble. Both the Town Cemetery, established concurrently with Friends' Cemetery in 1710, and the later Cedar Cemetery were set up as nonsectarian cemeteries, as opposed to Friends' Cemetery, which was associated with Quakers (Miner 2004). The concentration of phyllite headstones at Friends' Cemetery, with only a few other examples at the other historical cem eteries in Jamestown, may represent a religious preference for this stone over marble during the first half of the 19th century. Headstone motif patterns also correlate with changing stone use. Deetz and Dethlefsen (1965; Dethlefsen and Deetz 1966) plotted design types against the date range to illustrate the replace ment of headstone design motifs by later ones. Figures 3-6 show the gravemarker stone mate rials and designs observed in Jamestown cem eteries and Friends' Cemetery, respectively. The earliest style is the death's head, which has little representation in Jamestown and is not depicted on any gravemarkers at Friends' Cemetery. This motif is gradually replaced in cemeteries in Massachusetts by cherubs, which are then eclipsed by the urn-and-willow design around 1800 (Dethleftsen and Deetz 1966). This pattern is consistent with the headstone styles in James town, with the earliest featuring the winged skull before the cherub becomes prominent. The cherub can be seen as a gradual change from the winged skull, but the change to the urn-and-willow motif is abrupt in the early 19th century. Friends' Cemetery also has headstones with a solitary-urn design that is not discussed in Dethlefsen and Deetz's study (Figure 7). This design first appears on headstones dating to 1821, while the first appearance of the urn and-willow motif is 1825. This type of solo-urn motif has been noted in other studies of New England historical gravestones, including those in Providence (Luti 2007) and in Cumberland County, Maine (Giguere 2005). Giguere (2005) notes that the urn is a symbol of mourning and also observed a large amount of variation in the design, whereas the urn motifs at Friends' Cemetery are all nearly identical. The urn motif on phyllite headstones is an anomaly among the other Jamestown historical cemeteries. This motif and rock-type combina tion was observed at a cemetery near the Ste vens shop in Newport within the same temporal</page><page sequence="9">110 HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY 45(4) Jamestown Cemeteries—Stone Type by Date Marble Phyllite ♦ ♦ ♦ m ♦ Slate 1 t t t 1 1 r 1650 1700 1750 1800 1850 1900 FIGURE 3.

Drawing and photo of urn motif on an 1829 headstone. (Drawing and photo by author, 2008.) range as at Friends' but only appears at the single location in Jamestown. Half the stones that feature the single-urn motif are signed by Philip Stevens, and, given the identical appear ance in design, stone type, and headstone form, it appears that he carved all of these headstones, which range in date from 1821 to 1848. Philip Stevens ran his family's shop from 1820 to 1866 and is well known for plain stones with such romantic-period funerary icons as willows and urns (Hall 2005). His work changed during the 1840s when marble quarries opened in Vermont and slates began to be phased out for headstones (Garman 2006). Two of the marble stones he carved feature the urn-and-willow motif, but he appears to have only carved the solitary urn on the phyllite stones. This transition is visible in Figures 3-6, as marble began to replace slates in the first half of the 19th century and both the single-urn and the urn-and-willow design motifs replace the cherubs. The urn motif on the phyllite headstones reaches its peak of popularity in 1840 with 5 of the 14 gravestones of this type at the Friends' Cemetery carved in that year. Headstones made from slate and phyllite often show heavy effects from mechanical weathering along the surface foliation planes. In contrast, headstones made from fine-grained black slate show very little damage from weathering. Nonetheless, there are very few examples of this black-slate material in Jamestown: three in Friends' Cemetery and one in Cedar. The latter is from 1716 and features a winged skull. The Friends' stones are within a decade of each other, ranging from 1784 to 1792. Job How land's headstone from 1785 is similar to Capt. John Eldred's, carved the year before, and both were probably carved by John Bull. The 1792 black-slate headstone was carved for Damaris, daughter of Capt. Josiah Hazzard. The quality of this stone and the presence of the title "Capt" on two of them may indicate status, although more examples are necessary to determine this. The phyllite-stone type seems to represent a temporal preference rather than a cultural one. Within the 60 years when phyllite markers were used at Friends' Cemetery, half were carved for women and half for men. Additionally, there does not appear to be any association between family names and particular stone types. Similar to observations made by Bauer et al. (2002), a large percentage of the headstones at</page><page sequence="12">MICHAEL L. BRENNAN—Geological Survey of Historical Cemeteries, Jamestown, Rhode Island, 1693-1900 113 Friends' Cemetery are either illegible due to breakage or weathering, or were never engraved. Of the total number of headstones at the cem etery, 42% (n=158) are illegible, as opposed to 30% of the total (n=415) for the combined cemeteries in Jamestown, probably because Friends' Cemetery has the earliest graves on the island. Based on the rock-type data for dated headstones, the rows of unmarked slate stones in the northwest corner of the cemetery likely represent the first use of the lot by the Quakers, who often used unmarked stones (Miner 2004). There are other illegible stones in the cemetery, however, as well as at the other cemeteries in Jamestown. Thirteen of these are marble, but can be given a terminus post quern by rock type. With one exception from the Governor Carr Lot, marble headstones appear no earlier than 1802, while slate is phased out during the first half of the 19th century. The phyllite head stones, with two exceptions, appear within about a 60-year period from 1787 to 1848, however. Based on stonecutter signatures, many of these stone types in Jamestown were carved by Philip Stevens. There are six illegible phyllite head stones in Jamestown at Town Cemetery, Friends' Cemetery, Arnold Lot, and Tew Cemetery. The results of this study strongly suggest that these headstones date to that period in the late 18th to early 19th centuries. When the urn motif is added to these data, the time period is decreased to a 30-year period from 1821 to 1848, further narrowing the possible range if, for example, a motif were present on a headstone on which the date was illegible. The slate and phyllite types used for gravestones in Jamestown are low-grade metamorphic rocks. The nondescript nature of these rocks prevents them from being diagnostic for sourcing due to their common fine-grained composition. While this does not aid in determining the quarry location, it does reveal interesting information about stonecutting. These low-grade metamorphic rocks were intentionally chosen for use as gravestones because fine-grained rock is easier to cut and engrave (Ludwig 1975). Bauer et al. (2002) also documented a preference for fine-grained rock in early graveyards in Ohio, likely because these stones are easier to carve, and fine-grained rock makes for cleaner engravings. The headstones from Jamestown's historical cemeteries are not local to the island, which has formations of higher-grade metamorphic rock (Hermes et al. 1994), and, therefore, the sources of these rocks are not within a kilometer of these cemeteries. The Stevens shop operated out of Newport, which may have been a rock source. Other possible sources for these low-grade metamorphic slates include Providence, Massachusetts, and the British Isles. Nevertheless, the petrographic data helped confirm the visual identification of headstone-rock types, allowing for a general seriation pattern of stone use to be developed for the Jamestown historical cemeteries. Conclusion General stone types can be used to place illegible gravestones into an approximate time period. In rare cases, such as the phyllite and urn-motif headstones, a more specific time can be pinpointed. Petrographic examination of samples from historical gravestones, carried out during this survey, was unable to determine a potential source or specifically date unmarked headstones without a much more detailed sampling of gravestones and the possible quarry sites. There are, however, mineralogical differences between slate gravestones that in future research could differentiate between other headstones or cemeter ies. While this study was limited in its sample size, given the focus on confirming visual iden tification, further work could be done on more extensive samples to identify headstones that came from the same rock formations, even if those sources cannot be identified. The geological survey did show that these rocks are not local to Jamestown, so stone had to have been transported at least across Narragansett Bay, if not from farther away. This approach could be applied to other New England cemeteries, however, regional scale has to be considered. Deetz and Dethlef sen (1971) shows that motifs on headstones in Massachusetts spread out from Boston at a rate of 1 mi. per year. Therefore, the date ranges recorded for Jamestown would not necessarily be applicable to Newport or Providence cemeteries. Nonetheless, this study demonstrates that, within regional and subregional contexts, it is possible to delineate patterns in the temporal and spatial distributions of legible stones based on stone use, and these patterns can be used to infer dates and other factors for weathered monuments.</page><page sequence="13">114 HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY 45(4) Acknowledgments I would like to thank Daniel Murray, Chris Calabretta, David Kratzmann, Rod Mather, Alicia Caporaso, James Garman, Rosemary Enright, Jane Miner, the GSO Alumni Associa tion, and Alton Head III of the Cedar Cemetery Company, Jamestown, Rhode Island, for their assistance with this project.
