This concise review of the gerontological literature may mark a turning-point in con- temporary ideas about aging. The author has fused various biological and philosophical aspects of senescence in a new synthesis to resolve a dilemma which has been hampering the development of gerontology. Since the late nineteenth cen- tury, thought about aging has been char- acterized by divergent tendencies. The trend in philosophy has been away from the idea of progress, and this has engendered a rather pessimistic attitude among geronto- logical theorists. At the same time, there have been advances in empirical science which seem to open promising prospects for funda- mental research into the causes of old age, e.g., tissue culture, protein chemistry and radioactive tracers. Meanwhile, the large increase in the number of aged persons has created for the first time the social support necessary for large-scale research in geron- tology. In the conffict between these philosophic, scientific and social pressures, the author takes his stand with the latter two. He is not overawed by the current trend of intel- lectual pessimism. He seems to feel that the past half century of gerontological research gives him enough solid ground for a confident standpoint. At the same time the narrative is permeated with a sense of responsibility and urgency in the face of the growing social and medical problems of an aging popula- tion. Here we may see the outlines of a new gerontology, confident but empirical, activist but sophisticated. In this book a vast amount of important data has been organized in a creative manner. In accord with his recognition of the press- ing nature of gerontological problems, the author has tried to formulate key experi- ments by which various theories of aging can be proved or disproved in the near future. He restlessly probes the literature, pointing out actual or potential bottlenecks and seek- ing areas for a possible breakthrough. His hardheaded realism in this regard should prove both stimulating and profitable, be- cause the suggested crucial experiments are kept within the financial and organizational bounds of gerontology as it actually is rather than as it might be. The author is opti- mistic but not utopian. Dr. Comfort believes that the most plaus- ible general theory of aging is the one sug- gested by Bidder. According to that con- cept, aging is not part of the inherent life- pattern of an animal but is rather the anarchic situation resulting after that pattern has run its course. As the author expresses it, "senescence is typically an undirected process-not a part of the programme, but a weakening of the directive force of the programme" (p. I90). The evidence, according to the author, does not support the assumption that senes- cence is a product of natural selection and, therefore, must have a biological function. He particularly rejects the teleological ideas of Pearl and Warthin, who thought of aging as the price paid for the evolution of the higher species. Senescence, the author notes, is rather uncommon in "wild populations." With few exceptions (e.g., rotifers), aging becomes important only in the comparatively recent stages of human social evolution. The concept of senescence, he suggests, is largely justified by human needs and desires rather than by purely biological considera- tions. The author would like to see geron- tology liberated from anthropomorphic biol- ogy and Darwinist sociology. A disappointing aspect of the work is the deficiency of historical insight. Despite the title of the first chapter, "Introductory and Historical," there is little historical method in the book, if we think of the historian as trying to understand rather than judge the past. The author apparently has not con- sulted the historical literature. He has not attempted a liaison with the great pre- nineteenth-century biological tradition.

In fact, only four titles before Ii85 are listed. The result is an unfortunate shortening of perspective which mars an otherwise distinguished work. This book is a competent and provocative survey of a half century of gerontological research. It should be listed with the his- torical papers of J. T. Freeman, J. Steudel and F. D. Zeman and the bibliographies of N. W. Shock as one of the essential guides for anyone interested in the history of gerontology. Harvard University GERALD GRUMAN * _ *</page></plain_text>
