<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Revised Pages 1  •  Weimar- Era Montage Perception, Expression, Storytelling The terms montage and collage have become synonymous with the radical  experimentation that altered the status and physiognomy of art in early  twentieth- century Europe. They encompass a wide array of practices pre- mised on quoting, combining, and juxtaposing materials that straddle the  bounds of old and new media— from literature and stage drama to painting,  sculpture, photography, film, and radio. Common to these practices is the  exuberant transgression of the canons of normative aesthetics, coupled with  an often belligerent contempt for the institutions of academic art and an op- timistic willingness to draw inspiration from the world of consumer culture,  advertisement, and the mass media. Montage, the term that emerged in Ger- man as the overarching category encompassing diverse procedures of dissem- blage and recomposition, marks the confluence of two distinct strands of  experimentation. One was inspired by the turn to collage of cubism and the  intermingling of verbal and visual expression within Italian futurism, as in- fluenced by the experiments of artists like Apollinaire; this strand also in- cludes the linguistic practice of the Expressionist Wortkunst circle around  August Stramm and precursors to concrete poetry like Christian Morgen- stern. After the mid-1 920s crucial impulses came from the reception of So- viet film and photography, especially given the centrality ascribed to mon- tage in the film poetics of pioneering experimental directors like Vertov,  Pudovkin, Kuleshov, and Eisenstein. While in a German context the initial  inspiration for experimentation with visual and verbal collage may well have  come from cubism’s “pasted- paper revolution,” it is significant that terms like  Klebebilder and geklebte Bilder (pasted images) were soon supplanted by the  generic term montage. To the radical artists associated with Dada and Con- structivism, montage appeared preferable to the clumsy translations of the  French collage because it directly evoked the world of machines, industrial  14 </page> <page sequence="2"> Revised Pages Weimar-Era Montage  •  15 production, and mass consumption, thus emphasizing the constructed qual- ity of artifacts and their reliance on found materials and ready- made parts.1 The iconoclasm and antiestablishment streak of interwar montage prac- tices have long been associated with an all- out assault on traditional notions  of representation and narrative. In undermining the integrity of the artistic  object, montage challenges the idealist premises that governed aesthetic dis- course in the nineteenth century, first and foremost the requirement that the  artwork display a character of unity and organicity and thus allow for a her- meneutic mode of reception based on the congruence between the whole  and its component parts. Montage hinges on yanking elements out of their  trusted environments and inserting them into new contexts. It thus deploys  them as signs that acquire new valences depending on the relations they enter  with surrounding objects, while never completely suppressing their link to  the contexts from which they were taken. The ensuing semantic interferences  produce an undecidability that dramatizes the split nature of the sign and  arbitrary mechanism of signification, calling into question the possibility of  transparent meaning, stable reference, and trustworthy representation. Espe- cially in the early practices of futurism and Dada, montage works ranging  from visual collages to opto- phonetic compositions and sound poems de- monstratively flouted the established conventions that framed narrative in  verbal and visual media— the need for hierarchically ordering space and  time, construing a stable point of view and motivated sequence of events, and  establishing clear extratextual references that would aid in disambiguating  meaning.2 Yet by the mid- 1920s the Dadaist assault on representation gave  way to more structured compositions bent on manipulating perception by  imitating forms in a variety of media and genres. These compositions aimed  to elicit modes of interaction whose peculiar expressivity was at time associ- ated with an unorthodox notion of narrative. At stake was a type of perfor- mance that no longer hinged on trading meanings extracted from stories  through acts of interpretation but rather directly reshuffled the ties that ex- isted among objects. In this chapter I will trace the general contours of this  link between expression and narrative, describing the anthropological un- derpinnings of the imitative behavior it presupposes, the mechanism of anal- ogy and parody that propels it in a montage aesthetics, and its distinctive  phenomenological materialism. •  Berlin Dada makes for a useful point of departure in tracing the de- velopment of the nexus between expression and narrative that fueled the aes- thetics of montage in the 1920s.

Wieland Herzfelde,  the brother of John Heartfield and a prominent member of Berlin’s Club  Dada, penned the introduction to the exhibition’s catalog, which is tasked  with laying out Dada’s response to contemporary art— including its reasons  for worrying about art in the first place— without betraying the Dadaists’  signature belligerence and self- undermining gesture. Dadaism emerges from  Herzfelde’s portrayal as an iconoclastic dilettantism that ditches conven- tional aesthetic standards and privileges mechanical media like photography.  Especially the cut- and- paste art this medium makes possible poses a deliber- ate challenge to the contemporary art establishment: The Dadaists say: When in the past colossal quantities of time, love,  and effort were directed toward the painting of a body, a flower, a hat,  a heavy shadow, and so forth, now we need merely to take scissors and  cut out all that we require from paintings and photographic represen- tations of these things; when something on a smaller scale is involved,  we do not need representations at all but take instead the objects  themselves, for example, pocketknives, ashtrays, books, etc., all things  that, in the museums of old art, have been painted very beautifully  indeed, but have been, nonetheless, merely painted. . . . Any product  that is manufactured uninfluenced and unencumbered by public au- thorities and concepts of value is in and of itself Dadaistic, as long as  the means of presentation are anti- illusionistic and proceed from the  requirement to further the disfiguration of the contemporary world,  which already finds itself in a state of disintegration, of metamorpho- sis. . . . The Dadaists acknowledge as their sole program the obligation  to make what is happening here and now— temporally as well as  spatially— the content of their pictures.3 The passage well captures the benefits Herzfelde and his fellow Dadaists as- cribed to montage. Its incorporation of unsublimated objects—  “pocketknives, ashtrays, books”— appears as an authentic and efficient way  for engaging experience, one that saves the artist the pesky labor of represen- tation. Using scissors to mercilessly cut around reality’s fabric is also a fitting  response to the brutality and ethical bankruptcy of the newly established  German republic, as telescoped by the commentaries placed at the end of the  introduction and devoted to composite artifacts exhibited at the fair, which  paint a bleak portrayal of an immediate postwar period marked by the dehu- manizing treatment of war veterans, the moral and ideological decay of the  </page> <page sequence="4"> Revised Pages Hannah Höch, Schnitt mit dem Küchenmesser Dada durch die letzte Weimarer Bier- bauchkulturepoche Deutschlands (Cut with the Kitchen Knife Dada through the Last  Weimar Beer- Belly Cultural Epoch of Germany) (1919).

This is a landscape that  screams to be cut open by Dada’s kitchen knife, to paraphrase the title of  Hannah Höch’s 1920 photomontage, a barbed cross section of life in Weimar  Germany that was also on display at the fair, and montage’s systematic defil- ing of putatively intact experience does just that. Indeed, its stroke of genius  lies in rendering, at a basic structural level, the semblance of a world in sham- bles while avoiding depicting it in an illusionistic or naturalistic fashion.  Montage thus turns the splintering and degradation of contemporary experi- ence into an inexorable aesthetic principle, one that refuses to sublimate real- ity through embellishing representation and rather embraces it for what it is. Herzfelde’s text also comments on the radical streak of montage strategies,  which are not just another style but rather promise to subvert representation  altogether. In pondering what becomes of art’s content if one bypasses repre- sentation and merely incorporates found objects, Herzfelde seems content to  chuck all demands that art express a content at all. “The Dadaists acknowl- edge as their sole program the obligation to make what is happening here and  now . . . the content of their pictures,” he insists. That is to say, for the Dadaists  experience in its unmediated form is its own content. This grants them license  to bypass the mediating function of representation and allow the incorpo- rated fragments to simply be, that is, to function in an indexical mode in order  “to further the disfiguration of the contemporary world, which already finds  itself in a state of disintegration, of metamorphosis.” Thus for Herzfelde mon- tage displays an awareness of the world as a semiotic tapestry in which objects  double- task as signs. Its activist streak allows for unhinging them from the  orders of the real that compel them to signify in specific ways and to exhibit  them in their immediate materiality. This may well throw a wrench into real- ity’s chain of signification and cause its fabric to unravel, hastening a process  of decomposition that is presumably well under way. In sum, montage appears in the text as a strategy that enables the Dadaists  to construe allegorical compositions that denounce the status quo and simul- taneously stage their own unraveling to undermine the residual representa- tional structure in which they are embedded. This involves exploiting the  demonstrative force of the montaged fragments, which, as Theodor W.  Adorno recognized, insistently point outside the artifact to the context from  which they were yanked, only to fold back onto themselves. Such indexical  pull enables the objects to resist appropriation for a mimetic representational  regime that would reduce them to signs split between an ideational signified  and a material signifier.4 It is a strategy that both thematizes and undermines  the allegorical signification of montage artifacts, signaling that their mean- ing is makeshift and transient. Allegorical compositions are premised on es- </page> <page sequence="6"> Revised Pages Weimar-Era Montage  •  19 tablishing a conceptual link between material object and allegorical message  that relates the object’s physical appearance purposefully to its meaning. This  tie is not intrinsically given but rather rests on social and cultural conven- tion— of the type, for example, that turns a scale in the hands of a blind- folded woman into an emblem of justice in the iconographic tradition of the  West. Montage exploits the fact that allegorical meaning and material signi- fier can come unglued in the absence of obvious guidelines for attributing  meaning. In other words, images can easily become unintelligible if the right  clues for semantic disambiguation are withheld, for instance, if recipients are  unable to connect the dots in linking the signifier “woman with scale” with  the signified “justice.” Let me return, by way of example, to the portrayal of upper- class heed- lessness in The Multi- Millionaire, the 1923 photomontage by Hannah Höch  discussed in the introduction. Here the depiction of the two financiers who  walk atop fairgrounds with guns sticking out of their head and metal tools in  their hands intimates associations with industrialist exploitation. This read- ing is supported by the clever double coding the image conjures for the metal  tools, which evoke the world of industrial labor while also looking like im- proper weapons. One could, however, speculate further about the meaning  of these rods. The disparate connections they entertain with other fragments  do not exclude the possibility that a third meaning may be in play— for in- stance, that the rods may be stand- ins for walking sticks, an attribute of  manly elegance one could well expect the men to have. This would poten- tially suggest a different reading of the men’s function in the composition,  one that complicates or even undercuts an understanding of the image as  mounting a critique of capitalist violence. In the end the rods function like  material relics that allow for multiple semantic connections without endors- ing any of them, thus threatening the composition with unraveling in a heap  of incongruous fragments. It is easy to see how the theoretical reception of the 1970s and 1980s  seized on pronouncements like Herzfelde’s to make sense of the jarring works  of Dada, often finding in montage the discursive pivot of a destructive aes- thetics that subverts conventional models of representation and narrative by  parodying them in eviscerating fashion. Especially the semiotically inflected  readings of poststructuralism emphasized the attack on signification  mounted by montage strategies, which were credited with mercilessly de- bunking the mechanisms of substitution that conceal the absence at the  heart of language.5 As incisive as these critical readings may be in undercut- ting the logocentric bias of Western philosophical thought, their under- standing of the sign as a stand- in for an absent referent tends to underplay  </page> <page sequence="7"> Revised Pages 20  •  The Chatter of the Visible the issue of how, specifically, the material qualities of the montage inserts  impact communication. This blind spot is already present in Herzfelde’s dis- course on montage, which pursues the dream of disentangling objects from  the signifying web that ensnares them in order to polemically display them in  their obstinate materiality. It is a vision that implicitly pits materiality against  language, understanding the former as a phantasmatic condition of matter  suspended in a state of grace prior to inscription. An examination of montage practices going back to cubism shows, how- ever, that they rarely lend themselves to upholding a neat dichotomy that  opposes language to materiality.6 Instead, they often explicitly query the sta- tus of objects as complex signifying entities whose material qualities are inex- tricably bound up with linguistic dynamics. A case in point is the manufac- turer’s inscription on the tire in Höch’s Multi- Millionaire, which challenges  the viewer to solve the riddle posed by its presence in the composition by  displaying fragments of its manufacturer’s name. The writing assigns the tire  a specific status as a commodity, and in so doing reminds the viewer that the  linguistic marking is an intrinsic component of the object as commodity. The  larger point here is that the inscription should be seen as part and parcel of  the thing’s thingness, and not simply as an effect of signifying strategies that  superficially overlay the object. Conversely, in dramatizing how objects are  made to function as signs, the montage procedure also calls attention to the  material status of language as reliant on the physical properties of specific  media and modes of inscription. One can conclude that montage practices  may well dramatize the dynamics of language and communication. They do  so, however, while conjuring a concept of materiality that, following Kather- ine Hayles, does not stand in antithesis to signification but is rather the result  of a complex interplay between an object’s (or medium’s) physical qualities  and available signifying modes.7 •  Herzfelde’s strategy to turn the physicality of found objects into a  weapon against representation did not succeed in bringing down the aca- demic art business that was a premier target of Dadaist vituperation. It did,  however, chip away at the hegemony of a late- idealist aesthetics that treated  artworks as self- enclosed totalities endowed with a quasi- religious meaning.8  In so doing it also shone a new light on the disjuncture between allegorical  message and artifact’s physicality that was the hallmark of a montage aesthet- ics. In the course of the 1920s this disjuncture was explored in practices that  abandoned the exuberant chaos of Dadaist montage for more structured,  and often openly figurative, compositions, which opened the way for the  </page> <page sequence="8"> Revised Pages Weimar-Era Montage  •  21 ubiquitous deployment of photography in advertisement and the print me- dia. Enabled by the introduction of cost- effective halftone printing and roto- gravure in the early decades of the twentieth century, the use of photographs  in both the high- brow and the leisure press was a decisive factor in the phe- nomenal growth of journalistic media in the immediate postwar period.  Hanno Hardt has described the many roles photography was called to play in  a culture that placed a new premium on the value of documentary informa- tion and factual reporting, promising to deliver unbiased depictions of actual  events that transcended cultural and linguistic barriers on account of the  universality and immediacy of visual communication, while at the same time  entering relations of both complementarity and competition with the  printed word.9 Especially photo- reportage lent itself to unfolding complex  stories made up of photographic sequences supplemented by textual inserts.  In the mainstream press these photo stories often propagated a self-  congratulatory view of German culture that affirmed middle- class values  while remaining largely unconcerned with the actual conditions of life in the  Weimar Republic. By contrast the deployment of photography and report- age by the militant Left displayed a bitingly critical edge aimed at disman- tling the fraudulent semblance of a wholesome world propagated by the  bourgeois press and documenting the corruption of the political elites and  the exploitation of the working class.10 Especially the photomontages that  John Heartfield produced for the leftist Arbeiter- Illustrierte Zeitung (AIZ;  Workers’ Illustrated Magazine) elevated this dismantling to an unremitting  formal principle by packing their scathing critique into carefully rephoto- graphed compositions that were designed to be taken in as straight photo- graphs at first sight. In so doing Heartfield’s montages drove home the point  that the contemporary world had all the integrity and harmony of a doctored  photograph. Significantly, it was the aesthetic experimentation of left- leaning enter- prises like the AIZ and the Malik Verlag, the publishing house founded by  Wieland Herzfelde in 1916, that nudged the change- averse mainstream press  toward innovative uses of photography and graphic design during the  1920s.11 This generally involved mixing different media— photography, ver- bal inserts, and abstract design elements— in narrative compositions that re- linquished illusionism while incorporating some measure of figuration and  even realistic representation.12 Sally Stein has observed that the more struc- tured compositions found in advertisements and the illustrated press hinged  on balancing incongruous demands. On the one hand, they sought to titil- late the reader’s curiosity with the promise of surprising juxtapositions. On  the other, they endeavored to contain the range of possible meanings so as to  </page> <page sequence="9"> Revised Pages 22  •  The Chatter of the Visible steer reception toward specific accounts. At issue was the need for shaping  the complex spatiotemporal processes of reading without undermining the  valuable connotations of transgression and open- endedness associated with  montage.13 These concerns often congealed around the tricky concept of “si- multaneity,” which in this context does not simply denote a reader’s ability to  take in a sprawling medley of verbal and visual information at once— a dream  of omniscience that was given the lie by experiments in the physiology and  psychology of perception, which detailed the eminently serial quality of ver- bal and visual information- processing. Rather, simultaneity was a rhetorical  strategy of composition that promised to yield boundless semantic permuta- tions by allowing for multiple and crisscrossing paths of reception. This strat- egy could both confound readers and place them in an omniscient position  of control, all the while downplaying the fact that the elements of the com- position were visually and semantically calibrated to direct attention in cal- culated ways. This kind of manipulation dispenses a specific type of pleasure  that hinges on enjoying both the thrilling anarchy of anti- illusionism and the  comfort of successful navigation.14 Montage thus delivered artifacts that fused open- endedness and the satis- faction of meaning in a precarious balance tantalizingly threatened by the  possibility that the tie between allegorical message and artifact’s physical ap- pearance might unravel. Nowhere is this disjuncture more cunningly ex- ploited than in John Heartfield’s AIZ photomontages, whose visibly fabri- cated illusionism both exemplified and mocked the return of naturalistic  representation and visual narrative in contemporary advertisement and  graphic design. A case in point is Heartfield’s famous “cabbage head” mon- tage, which appeared in the June 1930 issue of the AIZ. The image features  the bust- level portrait of a man in working- class clothes, slightly slouching in  his seat, his head covered in sheets of newspaper that bear the titles of two  prominent dailies, Vorwärts, the official organ of the Socialist Party, and  Tempo, a left- liberal newspaper. Lines of pedestrian verse in the image’s  bottom- right corner have the man declaring, in his own voice, his indoctri- nation by the mainstream press, which makes him blind to its complicity in  the exploitation suffered by the working class in the Weimar Republic. This  message is reinforced by the caption at the bottom of the image, which cau- tions that “those who read bourgeois newspapers becomes blind and deaf.  Away with the stultifying bandages!”15 By lumping the Socialist newspaper  with the bourgeois press, the image weighs into the ideological war raging  within the German Left in the latter years of the republic, which pitted the  antiparliamentarian and collectivist line of the Communist Party against the  liberal reformism of Social Democracy.

In self- identifying as a “Kohlkopf ” (cabbage head) proud of his own  “Blätter,” the man further highlights the pun that connects image and text.16  The German word Blatt means both leaf and a sheet of paper, and in this lat- ter meaning also functions as metonymic stand- in for “newspaper.” The in- terplay of image and text thus suggests that the liberal press turns its readers  into blind newspaper cabbage heads. Yet this portrait of a duped worker ex- ceeds the visual pun of the cabbage head blinded by its own leaves. Much of  the image’s impact lies in its manipulation of the conventions of the eye- level  portrait, which demand that the depicted person’s eyes stare out of the pic- ture so as to potentially lock in with the recipient’s gaze.17 In both conjuring  and frustrating this expectation the image invokes an anthropomorphic nat- uralism that demands that the man’s depiction be taken literally, suggesting  that the newspapers hampering the man’s vision function as an actual blind- fold rather than as a metaphor for the immaterial veil of ideology. In this way  the montage avoids portraying the rift within the Left as a clash between ri- valing worldviews and instead presents it as a conflict grounding in material  relations. The image’s literalizing strategy further involves stretching the  newspaper title Vorwärts (“Forward”) across the head’s lower portion as a  mouth of sorts that double- tasks as an injunction to move forward in what  appears as a striking conflation of utterance and organ of speech. The injunc- tion is countermanded by the leather straps in which the man is dressed.  They seem to bind the man to an invisible spot behind his back, making  movement unlikely. Such punning and literalizing strategy, which is typical for the photo- montages Heartfield produced for the AIZ from the late 1920s and through- out the 1930s, harkens back to the Dadaist deployment of allegory in steering  viewers’ reception and providing conceptual paths for deciphering the riddle  posed by the composition. The image’s play with the conventions of portrai- ture and calibrated assemblage of visual and verbal material make it possible  to overcome the first impression of an incongruous mélange of elements and  ascribe meaning to the assembled fragments by prompting the viewer to  choose from the multiple paradigmatic options available for each element so  as to string them together in a meaningful syntagmatic sequence. This alle- gorical procedure was not new to the visual tradition of the West, though  since the Renaissance it had been increasingly marginalized by the growing  identification of realist representation with verisimilitude and illusionism,  with whose effects it was seen as interfering. Neither is the thrill of allegorical  compositions new, which hinges on the incongruous sense of empowerment  </page> <page sequence="12"> Revised Pages Weimar-Era Montage  •  25 and frustration produced by the task of solving a complex riddle. What ap- pears new is that montage compositions pointedly foregrounded the mo- ment of incorporation; that is, the inserted materials were to be recognized  as having been pasted. This entails that the moment of construction not only  remains at some level perspicuous but is made to carry a proposition in itself. This statement lies in the mesmerizing chattering of forms that propels  the distinctive experimentation of Weimar- era montage, particularly as it be- came increasingly focused, in the mid- 1920s, on the ways in which percep- tion interacts with physical forms in shaping the contours of the material  world. A case in point is the bewildering intermingling of objects and shapes  that breathes a strange life into Heartfield’s composite image, casting the  physiognomic attributes of each element into sharp relief and enacting a dy- namic play of forms that is in excess of, though not necessarily in opposition  to, other processes of signification. The montage straddles the line between  metaphorical claim and literal statement, thus taking seriously the material- ity of the objects that carry allegorical meaning— for instance, the newspaper  as a blindfold that hampers the man’s vision. In the end the image will of  course be read allegorically when placed in the context of its own textual in- serts and other content in the AIZ, suggesting that the working class is being  duped by the disingenuous reformism that Germany’s social democracy ped- dles in the pages of Vorwärts. Yet its vividness goes beyond the visual joke of  the cabbage head, asking what it might be like for someone to have a bundle  of paper where the head should be. As John Berger once noted, Heartfield  uniquely excelled at this literal handling of objects, his images being most  compelling when they present objects as things, and only secondarily as sym- bols, so that their thingness is never completely subsumed under the alle- gorical messages they carry.18 Paraphrasing Walter Benjamin’s characteriza- tion of allegory in his treatise on the German mourning play, one could say  that in Heartfield’s literalizing photomontages the thingness of objects is  never reduced to serving as the inert shell of allegorical content but rather  shines forth with unsettling effects.19 •  Photomontages like Heartfield’s thus raise the question of how con- temporaries negotiated the physical allure of objects in composite artifacts,  including photography, that functioned as the repository of a tantalizing in- stability that both promised openness and threatened to undo allegorical  meaning. A sharp awareness of the literal force of photomontage is found in  Franz Roh’s introduction to Foto- Auge (Photo- Eye, 1929), one of two illus- trated volumes that appeared in conjunction with the pathbreaking exhibi- </page> <page sequence="13"> Revised Pages 26  •  The Chatter of the Visible tion Film und Foto held under the auspices of the Deutscher Werkbund in  Stuttgart in 1929. A noted art historian and eloquent champion of the mod- ern movement in art, Roh focused his essay on largely familiar debates on  photography before offering a survey of contemporary photographic forms  that devoted significant attention to photomontage, a medium with which  he himself experimented. Writing barely nine years after Herzfelde’s intro- duction to the Dada Fair catalog, Roh observed that the formal destructive- ness and compositional anarchy of Futurist and Dadaist montage had gradu- ally been displaced by streamlined compositions marked by “almost classical  moderation and calm.”20 Roh paid explicit homage to recent work by the  Malik Verlag, presenting it as part of a new trend that needed to be set off  from previous experimentation with collage, most notably cubism. In casting  his account in the language of Constructivism Roh argued that cubism had  focused primarily on formal experimentation in its endeavor to represent ob- jects by dissecting them into simple geometric forms. By contrast the cut and  paste of contemporary photomontage was more akin to manipulating frag- ments torn from the objects themselves. In other words, while cubism’s geo- metrical abstractions were still operating within a representational logic, al- beit an anti- illusionistic one, photomontage for Roh came closer to  Herzfelde’s indexical understanding of montage artifacts. It entailed con- structing new material units that Roh dubbed “graftings of reality.”21 These  experiential offshoots did not so much depict reality as modify it by their  very existence. In this discourse the traditional logic of representation, which  hinges on transposing a content into a linguistic or symbolic code, is replaced  by a logic of recombination that emphasizes the medium’s physical ability to  directly alter the orders of the real. Roh did not specify what this may mean  in the concrete, and it may be tempting to dismiss the clumsy term Wirklich- keitspropfung as a conceptually fuzzy and argumentatively inconsequential  metaphor. Yet earlier statements by him show that he took the material force  of photomontage literally, querying the unorthodox narratives that were  produced by such grafts of the real, which he linked to a depsychologized  understanding of expression that was rooted in the philosophical anthropol- ogy of the Weimar period. The question of expression looms large in his early Nach- Expressionismus  (Post- Expressionism, 1925), a remarkable investigation of the perplexing real- ist aesthetics that displaced the metaphysical pathos of Expressionism in the  visual arts and that was subsumed under the label of Neue Sachlichkeit, or  New Objectivity, from the mid- 1920s on.22 Roh manifestly struggled to find  suitable terms of analysis for appraising the resurging interest in the “world  of objects” (Gegenstandswelt) that drove the return of figuration and illu- </page> <page sequence="14"> Revised Pages Weimar-Era Montage  •  27 sionistic representation in the visual idioms of his day. Concerned that the  contemporary focus on Gegenständlichkeit, or the object- ness of things,  might be mistaken for the return of a dubiously affirmative realism, Roh  insisted that the new figurative trends rather displayed a material world  transfixed in a state of mesmerizing strangeness. Their fascination with “the  world of objects” was not an affirmation of reality’s unyielding facticity and  objective status, but rather provided a venue for rediscovering the awe-  inspiring magic of the forms found in experience, understood as the trigger  for a perception that did not simply record experience but rather shaped it  in fundamental ways.23 Roh thus championed the new art for its ability to  foreground the uncanny concreteness and alluring strangeness of the phe- nomenal world, as grounding in awareness that the very thingness of the  real was inseparable from the event of perception. As a result, the new aes- thetics of Gegenständlichkeit could no longer rely on a traditional notion of  mimesis hinging on providing representations that enlisted the artist’s inge- nuity and transformative intervention to animate an inarticulate world. In  other words, the artist’s task was no longer to make a mute universe speak by  lending the silence of things expressive power, but was rather about captur- ing, in the moment of perception, the giddiness of a world saturated with  inherent expressivity.24 Photomontage, Roh believed, epitomized this new aesthetic sensibility  by enjoining the exactness of photography in capturing the absolute expres- sive power of objects, while at the same time showcasing the dynamics of a  technologically augmented perception. Its piecemeal aesthetics lent itself to  emphasizing the nonorganic quality of its artifacts and thus foregrounded  the constructive streak of perception, which fabricated objects in accordance  with the forms of the phenomenal world rather than serving as a passive ve- hicle for their sensuous recognition. For Roh, photomontage’s ability to cap- ture an experience saturated by the overwhelming expressivity of things  made it into a unique conceptual pivot for rethinking the entire field of art,  and in fact, of all human expression.25 Understanding the new aesthetics  through the lens of montage helped to redefine the central category of Aus- druck (expression), a staple of Expressionism’s aesthetic discourse. Ausdruck  in Roh’s study no longer stood for the outward expression of an artist’s inner  vision but rather entailed an utterly externalized Ausdrücken, a stamping out  of experience to be obtained through the interaction of perception and form.  This in turn called for an imitative engagement with the objects of the phe- nomenal world that was not premised on reproducing their semblance, but  rather aimed at a generative duplication of forms, a type of mimicry that  could shape the ways in which the world was to be grasped through percep- </page> <page sequence="15"> Revised Pages 28  •  The Chatter of the Visible tion. Mimesis as mimicry thus configured itself as a powerful tool for ma- nipulating perception in a dynamic that directly produced experience. Roh’s rejection of an anthropocentric notion of mimesis and depsycholo- gized understanding of the artistic process resonated with contemporary in- quiries into the imitative triggers of animal and human behavior. His under- standing of expression as marking the congruence between the sensory  apparatus and the forms of the experiential world strikingly echoes the ac- count of Ausdruck that formed the core of Helmuth Plessner’s philosophical  anthropology from the early 1920s on. Plessner defined expression as a non- instrumental bodily routine that discloses the individual’s essential orienta- tion toward his environment. As a feature that defines humans as embodied  beings, Ausdruck was fundamentally indeterminate, a zone of psychophysi- ological indifference drained of specific emotional or cognitive directional- ity. As such it lent itself to investigating the vital role that interaction with an  embodied world plays in the individual’s constitution. This was grounded for  Plessner in the double- edged relation humans entertain to their bodies—  both inhabiting them as the incarnated locus of the self and using them as  another material tool for engaging their environment.26 In this split experi- ence of incarnation, Plessner argued, the self should not be seen as a psychic  or spiritual entity emanating from the body that houses it, but is rather an  interpolation of body and environment, the product of a phenomenological  “here” realized through the interaction between the individual and the em- bodied world. This interaction is itself based on a fundamental expectation  of reciprocity that ties the individual to the world. As Plessner insisted, what  constitutes the body as Leib, as the incarnated locus of the self, is the pres- ence of an environment that both affects it and which it in turn affects.27 Thus for Plessner Ausdruck, as a bodily routine that is cognitively and  emotionally blank, marked a degree zero in the human interaction with the  phenomenal world while at the same time foregrounding the expectation of  reciprocation that made this very interaction possible. Franz Roh’s celebra- tion of a world of objects drenched in intrinsic expressivity (Eigenausdruck)  may be seen as voicing the awestruck awareness about this fundamental  reciprocity— indeed, as marveling at the intuition of a self formed in the en- counter between the body and the forms of the world, of which the body is  itself one. If seen from this perspective, the principle of montage cherished  by Roh dramatizes a fundamental relation to the world, including one’s own  body, which grasps it as at once already formed (gestaltet) and open to fur- ther forming (Gestaltung). Gestaltung in this context entails an ex- pression, a  pressing out or outwardly oriented action that does not so much involve a  meaning— as the externalization of an inward content— as a making. Aus- </page> <page sequence="16"> Revised Pages Weimar-Era Montage  •  29 druck, as a degree- zero mode of interaction with the world, acknowledges the  mutual character of this making, which involves a self shaped by a world that  it shapes in return. Transposed into the conceptual register of a phenomeno- logical aesthetics, Ausdruck provides the foundation for a poietic process in  which interaction with the forms of the experiential world produces other  forms in an imitative process in which each new form is not an inferior copy  of the one that triggered repetition, but is rather situated on the same phe- nomenological plane. Mimesis in this respect becomes a principle of direct intervention into a  world whose physiognomy can presumably be redrawn by means of a creative  miming of forms. Within the discursive matrix of Constructivism from  which Roh was drawing, this entailed “to think and produce forms elemen- tally” so as to enact the principles of “simplicity, balance, self- evidence, highly  refined economy” that sustained the equilibrium governing the relations  among objects and living creatures in the experiential world, as Werner Gräff  put it in an essay that appeared in the inaugural issue of G, the journal of art  and design founded by Hans Richter in 1923.28 The Gestaltung or creative  forming championed by Gräff was meant to reveal the underlying unity of a  phenomenal world defaced by the chaos of proliferating life-s pheres and  ideological claims. Along these lines, in a programmatic text published the  previous year László Moholy- Nagy had called for a new art predicated not  on reproducing the semblance of the real but on “creating ever new, previ- ously unknown relations” that would renew the equilibrium that sustains the  experiential world while at the same time making it perspicuous.29 Moholy  pleaded for enlisting the new mechanical technologies of film and photogra- phy in amplifying the enlivening congruence between the body and the  world given to perception, and thus exploit to the fullest the biological po- tential of humans. This resonated closely with the Bauhaus’s agenda of revi- talizing experience by radically remaking the objects that give everyday life  its form, an agenda that Moholy helped further after his appointment as in- structor of the Bauhaus’s pioneering “basic course.” It involved the return to  an ancient notion of technē that refused to abide by the traditional divide  separating the purposeless sphere of art from that of utilitarian, industrial  production, thus encouraging artists to move freely between commercial and  nonutilitarian spheres. Not surprisingly, then, many artists associated with  Constructivism did not see a conflict between their endorsement of an art  devoted to emancipating humanity by refashioning the material world and  their pursuit of the very same principles in the exploitative world of com- merce and industrial production. This apparent blind spot was further com- pounded by the open contempt some of them voiced for contemporary po- </page> <page sequence="17"> Revised Pages 30  •  The Chatter of the Visible litical ideologies and philosophical discourses that would have provided a  salutary testing ground for the suspiciously abstract vision of a world marked  by simplicity, clarity, and balance that frequently authorized their work. This is a familiar criticism of Constructivism’s role in fostering dubious  aspects of technological modernity, and it needs to be acknowledged.30 At  the same time it is also important to recognize the insight afforded by the  understanding of reality that authorized its practices. Indeed, the appeal and  reach of a montage aesthetics is hard to grasp if one does not take seriously  the phenomenological vision of experience as a relational web woven through  the reciprocal interaction of bodies and objects. In this respect one should  note that the interest in manipulating perception by altering the relations of  the real was rarely motivated by a reductive behaviorism, that is, by a view of  human conduct as deterministically shaped by a stimulus- response mecha- nism. In the discourse of Moholy and other artists associated with the Bau- haus, the technological enhancement of human perception served both utili- tarian aims and was an end in itself, marking a heightening of being and  enlargement of nonconceptual knowledge that were worth pursuing in their  own right. In borrowing key terms from the conceptual arsenal of Construc- tivism Franz Roh also evoked its sense of wonder at the awe- inspiring blur- ring of nature and technology in a poietic activity that revived the Aristote- lian vision of a world caught in a process of immanent self- actualization.  Accordingly, montage for him denoted the ability to contribute to weaving  the dynamic ties that hold experience together by cutting out and grafting its  pieces through artifacts that did not represent the world but rather directly  renewed it. •  For Roh, as for many artists associated with Constructivism, the new  art dramatized a world that was at once rational and full of marvel. He coined  the term “magical realism” to capture its aesthetic outlook, and while ac- knowledging that this was a flawed and potentially misleading label, he also  insisted that it came closest to describing a state of affairs for which there  seemed to be no better designation. In particular, the term “magical” sug- gested itself for its ability to convey both the sense of awe elicited by the  phenomenal world and the eerie power of the antiorganicist aesthetics epito- mized by the montage principle, which promised to meddle with the world  by altering its forms.31 Magic was to be understood literally as an active inter- vention into the world that operated by appropriating its physiognomy, that  is, through acts of manipulative mimicry. Walter Benjamin keenly described the resurgence of this submerged mi- </page> <page sequence="18"> Revised Pages Weimar-Era Montage  •  31 metic mode in the sensuous power of commodities and the proliferation of  mimetic technologies like photography and film. At stake for him was a con- cept of imitation that stresses the moment of embodiment, and which Mi- chael Taussig describes as a fundamental cognitive function that approaches  the otherness encountered in the world through acts of sensuous assimilation.  In replicating a person’s or an object’s physiognomy as embodied form, Taussig  notes, one produces a copy that is not merely meant to convey a semblance,  but is rather invested with the power of the original— an imitative procedure  he dubs “sympathetic magic,” borrowing the phrase from James Frazer’s  Golden Bough. Its power of magic derives from the assumption of physical  contact that lends force to imitative behavior, and that Taussig ascribes to the  “unstoppable merging of the object of perception with the body of the per- ceiver and not just with the mind’s eye.”32 In other words, because perception  always involves the incarnated body, the value of making concrete copies does  not exhaust itself in their conceptual or representational content, but also re- sides in the physiological resonance with the object that is elicited by the pro- cess of imitation. Taussig is keen to emphasize the cognitive import that lies in  engaging the experiential world through imitative acts that lift one out of one- self and into the otherness of the fabricated copy.33 In other words, mimesis is  for him valuable as the faculty to “yield into and become other.”34 One can extrapolate that all inscription technologies, whether based on  textual, visual, or aural media, are ultimately modalities of sympathetic magic  according to Taussig’s Benjaminian framework, as they involve making cop- ies that mobilize the body at a physiological level. While this power of mobi- lization was overlooked by a Western philosophical discourse constrained by  its conceptual neglect of the material role of media in communication,  Taussig points to Benjamin’s discussion of montage strategies in advertising  as evidence of the forceful resurgence of this “primitive” understanding of  mimesis within industrial modernity. At issue is the aphorism from One- Way  Street (1928) in which Benjamin describes the visceral mimetic force of ad- vertisement, its ability to touch its recipients and move them out of them- selves in ways that potentially exceed the pull of the commodities it ped- dles.35 This mimetic impact was premised for Benjamin on the deployment  of montage strategies that bypassed argumentative discourse and contempla- tive modes of reception and instead hit their recipients with rapid-fi re juxta- positions, which hinged on collapsing the conventional distance separating  the represented objects as well as the distance between object and recipient.  In Taussig’s discussion of Benjamin’s gloss, montage epitomizes the sympa- thetic magic of inscription by explicitly enlisting and thematizing the physi- ological dimension of the mimetic.36 </page> <page sequence="19"> Revised Pages 32  •  The Chatter of the Visible Taussig’s discussion of mimesis as sympathetic magic finds important  resonances in Sally Stein’s comparative analysis of the montage practices ad- opted by German and American commercial artists in the interwar period.  Stein contrasts the open aversion American advertisers demonstrated to the  more experimental forms of photomontage, especially in cases that visibly  tampered with the human figure, with the practices of the German avant-  garde, which involved conspicuously antinaturalistic compositions that were  tolerant of violating the body’s integrity. For Stein this difference is to be  traced back to the risk- adverse attitude of American advertising agencies,  which feared alienating audiences that may interpret the nonnaturalistic rep- resentation of the human body as an actual violation. While one can debate  whether American advertisers rightly gauged or underestimated their audi- ence’s ability to deal with patently distorted representations of the body and  the natural world, their anxiety evinces an at least implicit awareness of the  mimetic “magic” of montage. That manipulating representations of the hu- man figure could come across as a literal defilement underscores how pro- ducing “copies” that disarticulated and reassembled the elements of the real  was potentially understood as a disconcerting rupture of intact experience.  American commercial artists, Stein maintains, sought to defuse this sense of  rupture by couching the disjunctive moment of montage within an overall  naturalistic composition.37 In emphasizing the prevalence of an antinaturalistic montage aesthetics  in Germany, Stein’s findings have implications that go beyond its underlying  rejection of an aesthetics of verisimilitude or illusionism. At stake is the de- mise of the understanding of mimesis as imitatio that the modern period in- herited from the Renaissance, and that hinged on capturing the likeness of  things by means of transfiguring representations that had the power to shed  light on experience, yet whose character as copies endowed them with a  structural bad conscience, sealing their subordinate status vis- à- vis a reality  to which they were by constitution inferior.38 By contrast, mimesis as dupli- cation of forms erases the hierarchical relation between original and copy, its  proliferating forms meddling directly with the orders of the real, collapsing  distance and transgressing boundaries. Narrative in this context hinges on  imitative behavior that affects perception by miming forms in a variety of  media and genres rather than a paradigm for constructing stories that func- tion as an analogon to experience. This concept of mimesis is unsettling in different, and arguably more pro- found, ways than any notion of mimesis predicated on reproducing sem- blance as schöner Schein. In surveying the enthrallment with physiognomic  boundary- crossing and the propensity for blurring media and modes of in- </page> <page sequence="20"> Revised Pages Weimar-Era Montage  •  33 scription in many montage works of this time, one obtains a strong sense of  distortion and violation that forms the dark underbelly of the feeling of awe  for which Roh celebrated the aesthetics of the New Objectivity. The mimetic  impulse, as described by Taussig, may well make possible an encounter with  the embodied world that yields a knowledge untainted by consciousness, yet  “to get hold of something by means of its likeness,” that is, to engage in acts  of sensuous assimilation to otherness comports a threat of depersonalization  or even the possibility of an organism’s dispersion in space.39 This danger is  made especially urgent by the proliferation of mechanically reproduced im- ages in the media. While objects and their “reproductions” may well occupy  different functional positions, their categorical difference is never secured  ontologically and is always at risk of collapsing. Put in the conceptual terms of Helmuth Plessner’s anthropology, assum- ing that the self is the by- product of an imitative interaction between body  and environment also postulates a structural disjuncture between the self-  awareness that is constitutive of selfhood and the body that enables this very  awareness through its encounter with the world. In other words, the very  interaction that allows for the self ’s constitution harbors the potential for its  unraveling, understood as the self ’s decentering with respect to its sustaining  body, which becomes one of countless objects and bodies littering experien- tial space.40 This threat of dissipation is often thematized in the physiog- nomic explorations of montage. It involves becoming unable to discern  where the body stops and the surrounding world begins, or being unable to  tell what belongs with what in a world of endlessly overlapping forms and  bodies. In this regard montage lends itself to interrogating the unstable and  constructed bounds of personhood, not as a psychological phenomenon but  as consigned to the fragile equilibrium between the perceiving body and the  world with which it interacts.41 •  The imitative performance that undergirds a montage aesthetics is at  bottom a form of parody that emphasizes the material physiognomy of the  mimed object. To once again take Höch’s Multi- Millionaire as an example,  parody here concerns the relation between the photographic inserts and the  objects they reproduce evocatively, both as individual fragments (the men’s  half faces, the guns’ segments, the metal tools, etc.) and in their physiog- nomic permutations as component parts of the assembled image (the gun  segments as the unsettling substitute for the back of one of the men’s heads).  To assert that the gun fragments function as a parodic supplement to the  man’s head requires, however, a more capacious concept of parody than the  </page> <page sequence="21"> Revised Pages 34  •  The Chatter of the Visible one suggested by traditional practices aimed at casting ridicule on an object  or a person by means of distorting imitation. In this respect it is helpful to  recall Linda Hutcheon’s expanded understanding of the parodic as a “repeti- tion with critical distance, which marks difference rather than similarity.”42  Emphasizing repetition instead of belittling ridicule enables Hutcheon to  highlight the cultural labor performed by parody’s mimicry, which lies in  staging a dialectic of similarity and difference that subjects cultural and so- cial codes to scrutiny. At bottom, this augmented notion of parody encom- passes distancing practices bent on producing “copies” whose twist on the  original engenders critical insight. At a perceptual level, the interweaving of similarity and difference that  ties the parodic object to its referent rests on the operations of analogy. Anal- ogy, as defined by Barbara Stafford, revolves around “the proportion or simi- larity that exists between two or more apparently dissimilar things.” In mark- ing a partial overlap of singular objects that does not require generalizations  or universal categories, analogy rests on a “vision of ordered relationships  articulated as similarity- in- difference.”43 While acknowledging analogy’s  role in conceptual and cognitive processes, Stafford especially emphasizes its  embodied nature, which for her is tied primarily to vision and its ability to  glean and exploit resemblance. As she argues, analogy’s foundation in the  basic mechanisms of perception drives its ability to draw meaningful con- nections that may well be “seen,” but are not immediately expressible in con- ceptual, discursive terms. In dubbing analogy “the art of connecting,” Staf- ford insists that it be regarded as “a demonstrative or evidentiary practice”  that does not entail observing and verbalizing relations of similarity found in  experience so much as dynamically producing them in the event of percep- tion.44 This involves, in the arts as in other domains, replicating these rela- tions in a “participatory performance” that is bound to produce artifacts that  demonstrate analogical ties by enacting them.45 It is significant, in this re- gard, that Stafford marshals various forms of montage art (collage, photo- montage, and assemblage) that all dramatize the process of “compelling dis- parate things to converge,” as illustration of the “inherent mimeticism” and  active, processual nature of analogy.46 If Stafford’s discussion of analogy and Hutcheon’s examination of parody  are both premised on an imitative interaction with the experiential world that  feeds off a productive tension between similarity and difference, their distinc- tive emphases also result in different assessments of this interplay. Stafford  emphasizes the connecting moment of analogy, specifically its ability to weave  together discordant particulars in acts of discernment that dramatize the in- tuitive processes at the heart of thinking and cognition. Hutcheon, by con- </page> <page sequence="22"> Revised Pages Weimar-Era Montage  •  35 trast, stresses the critical insights engendered by the moment of disunity that  characterizes parody. In other words, if Stafford valorizes analogy for its abil- ity to glean similarity in difference, Hutcheon’s parody inverts the terms of the  relation by foregrounding the moment of difference in similarity. This does  not mean that the two categories are at odds with each other, however, quite  to the contrary. Parody is a specific deployment of analogy, a strategic mode of  repetition that mobilizes the analogical ability to make connections in order  to mine the insights produced by the moment of difference thematized by the  very act of connecting. Underscoring the analogical operations of parody has  several advantages. In the first place, it illuminates the physiognomic level at  which parody operates, and that involves the dynamic interplay between per- ception and the forms of the experiential world. Second, it highlights the fact  that parody, as a mode of imitative repetition, is about connecting as much as  it is about separating; it produces contiguities at the same time as it distances.  This dialectic of disjuncture and conjunction aptly captures the multiple cod- ings of montage artifacts, indeed, the multivalence of its acts of transcontex- tualization and frequent flip- flopping between critique and affirmation. Fi- nally, this movement is not to be understood as a predictable oscillation  between stable entities. Emphasizing that parody is based on the dynamic  nature of analogy as a perceptual process allows for describing the parodic  imitation of montage as a spiraling interaction between sensory apparatus,  technologies and media, and the modes of representation and communica- tion they sustain at a given historical moment. •  Let me recapitulate, in closing, the main features of the narratives  that are framed by the understanding of expression, mimesis, and parody I  have sketched so far. To do so it will be helpful to draw on the diagnosis of a  crisis of the novel that drove debates on narrative in the early decades of the  twentieth century and contributed to setting the parameters for the scholarly  discourse on the modernist novel in post– World War II Europe. In an essay  from 1964 Hans Blumenberg posited that the novel’s difficulties in the mod- ern period stemmed from a structural disjunction whose description also  provided an account of the modern condition— a claim that captures the  main premise of much discussion about the novel in the first half of the  twentieth century. For Blumenberg the novel is the modern aesthetic form  that uniquely bears witness to the dynamism of a world whose infinite poten- tiality is realized in time. Under this experience of open- ended temporality,  reality is no longer pictured as a fundamental quality of experience that one  could make manifest through appropriate sensuous forms, but is rather  </page> <page sequence="23"> Revised Pages 36  •  The Chatter of the Visible viewed as an internally consistent syntax of elements, a text that infinitely  constitutes itself by following rules that immanently define its coherence.  According to Blumenberg, this new understanding of reality is inscribed in  the task that defines the novel as a genre, and that consists of creating worlds  whose relational structure and inner consistency possess what Blumenberg  calls Wirklichkeitswert (value or quality of reality). Yet the novel’s material  finitude, as determined by the fixity of print, is fundamentally at odds with  the temporal dynamism that defines reality’s relational web. One can con- clude that the novel’s difficulties stem from the demand that it live up to an  impossible task, namely, that it provide a correlate to the dynamism of time  through a form that is temporally fixed. Accordingly, modernist masterpieces  like Robert Musil’s The Man without Qualities (1930–3 2) dramatize a reality  whose dynamism resists fixation through their unruly and inconclusive  structure.47 Blumenberg’s account of the novel’s quandary may at first recall Hegel’s  verdict on the structural shortcomings of aesthetic forms, whose sensuous  finitude constitutively falls short of the demand of presenting a nonsensuous  Idea unfolding in time. Its attempt to link specific understandings of art to  evolving notions of reality further evokes the philosophy of aesthetic forms  developed by Georg Lukács in The Theory of the Novel (1914– 15), which  hinges on establishing a congruence between seminal stages in the self-  understanding of consciousness and corresponding moments in the develop- ment of aesthetic forms. Yet Blumenberg departs from the metaphysical tele- ology of history endorsed by Hegel and Lukács in ways that provide an  illuminating foil for discussing the mode of narrative ascribed to montage. If  for Lukács the temporal open- endedness of the modern condition registered  by the novel makes it impossible to construct a stable hermeneutic horizon  that would lend itself to making sense of experience, for Blumenberg the  question that haunts the novel concerns its failure to produce a correlate to  the dynamic syntax of relations that constitutes the real. Significantly, Blu- menberg traces this inability back to the anachronistic notion of mimesis  that ties narrative to reality in a relation of mutual implication and legitima- tion. That is to say, for Blumenberg the novel’s problem does not lie primarily  in its inability to represent the open- ended time of modernity but rather in  the demand that mimetic representation produce images that correspond to  reality— in this case, that the novel’s relational structure make reality’s syntax  of elements perspicuous. The criterion of adaequatio at the heart of this de- mand, Blumenberg notes, goes back to a notion of mimesis centered on pre- senting reality as momentarily self- evident truth, which grew out of the Pla- tonic understanding of being as exemplary, static, and self- contained.  </page> <page sequence="24"> Revised Pages Weimar-Era Montage  •  37 Defining mimesis as the production of enlightening congruence, whether at  a semantic or formal level, turns the dynamism of time into an intractable  problem given the novel’s static form.48 Blumenberg’s analysis helps to outline key aspects of narrative as it un- folds within the discursive matrix of montage. They include, in the first place,  conceiving of both experience and narrative as relational structures. Narra- tive furthermore relates to experience in a mimetic mode. The mimetic mode  enacted by montage is, however, not driven by the criterion of congruence  Blumenberg deemed problematic. Instead it involves a form of mimicry that  seeks to refashion the physiognomy of experience by producing artifacts and  engendering events designed to manipulate perception. Mimesis in this  framework no longer hinges on summoning images that correspond to real- ity at either a semantic or formal level, but rather involves a parodic repeti- tion that produces forms endowed with the same status as the objects they  imitate. By their sheer existence, the new objects reconfigure the relations of  the real. Narrative thus defined is not an object or a practice that abstracts  from experience in order to adequately represent its truth, but is rather impli- cated in the “making” of experience at a par with other practices. This under- standing departs from a vertical model of narrative as a portal that grants  access to reality’s deep meaning and reconfigures it as one of many practices  spread across a horizontal axis, one that involves stamping out experience by  altering its relations through imitative behavior. This horizontal understanding of mimesis helps illuminate the role that  analogical ties play in the parodic practice of narrative. To be sure, the pro- duction of resemblances or correspondences is at the heart of imitative be- havior. After all, repetition hinges on producing analogical overlaps, that is,  it involves a calibrated interplay of similarity and difference that establishes  relations of partial correspondence between two objects. In the mimetic  paradigm described by Blumenberg, however, analogical correspondence  does not simply stake out the terrain of imitative behavior; it also supplies  the principal criterion for assessing the relation between narrative and real- ity. In this account the novel, as an artifact, is set apart from reality, a cogni- tive or experiential construct, and the two stand in an uneasy relation to each  other due to faulty correspondence. Proper correspondence would produce  the cognitive surplus that could make that relation meaningful, that is, that  would allow for elucidating reality’s relational web through narrative. In  montage narrative, by contrast, analogical overlaps establish connections  that are understood as spatiotemporal ties in an embodied world whose  physiognomy they seek to alter. They are not necessarily a means for extract- ing meaning through enlightening resemblance; put differently, the produc- </page> <page sequence="25"> Revised Pages 38  •  The Chatter of the Visible tion of meaning— as a cognitive or ideological content— is not a primary  criterion for engendering analogical practice. This is not to say that meaning  has no place in this understanding of narrative. Rather meaning becomes one  factor among others, an important one, to be sure, but not the crucial, defin- ing factor, as is the case for hermeneutically driven accounts. De- emphasizing  the role that cognitive sense- making plays in narrative allows for foreground- ing aspects that normally get short shrift, such as the interplay between the  sensory apparatus and specific technologies and the import of a medium’s  specific material qualities in the event of communication. It is significant, in this respect, that Blumenberg’s characterization of real- ity as a dynamic relational network is patterned on a notion of linguistic  structure as only marginally inflected, if at all, by the material qualities of the  medium in which it is instantiated. The linguistic and textual biases of his  account are inscribed in the essay’s presumption that the novel constitutes  the foremost narrative form of the modern period— a bias that reflects an  understanding of narrative dominant up to structuralism. This assumption  underwrites Blumenberg’s discussion of mimesis as the requirement that  there be congruence between the novel, a linguistic artifact, and a reality  conceived as a dynamic syntax of elements, that is, as a signifying unit whose  successful instantiation rests on specific rules whose enactment will guaran- tee its inner consistency.49 In pointing to this limitation, my aim is not to  critique Blumenberg’s account from the perspective of hindsight but rather  to use its conceptual constraints as a foil for outlining the reconceptualiza- tion of narrative at play in montage practices. At stake is the assumption that  the print media that propelled the novel in modernity successfully efface  their materiality in encoding and transmitting content. This assumption  goes hand in hand with an understanding of the book as a tool for conveying  an immaterial content that is minimally, if at all, affected by the medium’s  physical qualities. The discourse and practice of montage corrects the literary  and linguistic bias of this influential concept of narrative. In particular, the  new awareness about the perceptual potential of technologies like film and  photography redirects attention to a medium’s physical qualities, including  those of print. This involves a concept of materiality that, in the words of  Katherine Hayles, does not simply map onto the physical qualities of objects  and media but rather acknowledges their boundedness with signifying pro- cesses. As Hayles explains, It is impossible to specify precisely what a book— or any other text— is  as a physical object, for there are an infinite number of ways its physi- cal characteristics can be described. Speaking of an electronic text, for  </page> <page sequence="26"> Revised Pages Weimar-Era Montage  •  39 example, we could focus on the polymers used to make the plastic case  or the palladium used in the power cord. . . . What matters for under- standing literature, however, is how the text creates the possibilities  for meaning by mobilizing certain aspects of its physicality. These will  necessarily be a small subset of all possible characteristics.50 By noting that only a small set of physical qualities is relevant in describing  how texts and artifacts produce signifying effects under specific circum- stances, Hayles is able to conclude that “the materiality of an embodied text”  is not synonymous with the sum total of its physical properties, but is rather  “the interaction of its physical characteristics with its signifying strategies,”  which include “the social, cultural, and technological processes that brought  it into being.”51 The montage practices under examination here are often pre- cisely about exploring the border between the physical and the material  through multiple forms of mimicry, indeed, about pushing the physical until  it tips over into the material, that is, until it produces semantic and rhetorical  effects. They thus dramatize materiality as “an emergent property,” to use an- other of Hayles’s formulations, a construction that is processual and con- stantly reshaped in the manipulative interplay of perception, technology,  modes of signification, and relations of power.52 This tipping of the physical into the material is at the heart of Walter  Benjamin’s understanding of storytelling and related interest in the effects of  filmic montage, which form the focus of the next two chapters. In his essay  on The Storyteller (1936) Benjamin was among the first to historicize the rela- tion between narrative practice and material media and forms of communi- cation by reconstructing, in a speculative vein, the conditions of possibility  of storytelling in oral cultures, which for him grounded in mnemonic pro- cesses supported by routines of the body. In deemphasizing the involvement  of consciousness, meaning, and interpretation for narrative practice Benja- min called attention to the limiting conceptual framework that dominated  current debates on a crisis of narrative, which rested on the uninspected as- sociation of narrative with the novel as a print medium. Unlike many con- temporaries, Benjamin neither celebrated nor bemoaned the demise of the  printed novel following the rise of new media and instead sought to describe  the realignment of narrative practices that was bolstered by the rapidly shift- ing media- scape of his day. This endeavor enabled him, in “The Work of Art  in the Age of Its Technological Reproducibility” (1935– 39), to reconceptual- ize mimesis as form of mimicry that finds its most advanced technological  enactment in filmic montage. Both “The Storyteller” and the artwork essays were drafted in the mid-  </page> <page sequence="27"> Revised Pages 40  •  The Chatter of the Visible 1930s, at a time when much of Weimar- era montage art had been proscribed  by the Nazis. Yet the material and the concerns mined in the essays relate  directly to Benjamin’s engagement with the work of artists associated with  Dada, Constructivism, and surrealism during the Weimar years. They thus  offer an illuminating reflection on the peculiar mimetic force and techno- logical adaptability of the understanding of narrative associated with mon- tage in the 1920s. </page> </plain_text>
