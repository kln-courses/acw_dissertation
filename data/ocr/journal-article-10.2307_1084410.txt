<plain_text><page sequence="1">Literacy: The Crisis of a Conventional Wisdom MANFRED STANLEY Syracuse University The current debate on the moral status of modern society has obviously affected every one of its institutions. Attitudes to- ward modern society range across the scale from uncritical celebration to denunciation. This internal debate cannot be separated from perspectives on the meaning of "development" with respect to social change in the non-Western areas of the world.' Those inclined to take the moral stature of modern society for granted tend to look upon socioeconomic devel- opment in somewhat technical terms. They content themselves with inquiring after the techniques of social engineering that can facilitate the evolution of "them" into "us." Those who scorn modernism consider development a scientistic euphe- mism for cultural imperialism. This conflict has now been joined in the field of education, even on its most fundamental conceptual level- the very notion of literacy itself. The popularity among Western dissident intellectuals of the argument that export of education, even in the minimal form of literacy, constitutes cultural imperialism is an indicator of the critical doubt which plagues many among us about the most basic facets of our own world. To question that we have learned what we should have learned in an institution that engages our undivided attention for up to a quarter of our lives is to ask whether we ourselves are literate. My examination of this debate in education will take the form of a critical analysis of Paulo Freire's writings on literacy May 1972 373</page><page sequence="2">Literacy and literacy training. Freire has been chosen for three reasons. First, he is a learned man devoted to the theoretical explication of a mode of praxis in which he is deeply engaged. Second, Freire is no narrowly specialized thinker. Behind his attack on the established notion of literacy lies a coherent diagnosis of what has allegedly gone wrong in modern societies. That diag- nosis can be summed up in the word "technicism." Finally, his concrete proposals for change derive with uncompromising directness from the nature of this diagnosis. It is this con- nection between moral rationale and practice, not faddish ne- gation, that makes for radical thinkers. Radicalism, for better or worse, entails locating what one believes to be the generic root of a problem, analyzing the implications, and acting ac- cordingly. The Concept of Technicism Paulo Freire does not himself relate his views on literacy to the problem of technicism. His rhetorical enemy is political oppression. For this reason some have seen his work as appli- cable only to societies like those of Latin America in which the processess of democratic liberalization have been aborted. His rhetoric sounds strange to ears which are accustomed to the unorchestrated demands of a multiplicity of interest groups. To dismiss Freire's challenge to modern education on these grounds would be a mistake. Freire's assertion that a properly literate man is immune to political oppression involves a notion of literacy so fundamen- tal as to transcend the single illustrative case of political op- pression. The role of education in man's "ontological vocation to be more fully human" is what is really at stake. Any dis- cussion of freedom on this level must entail the generic prob- lem of "false consciousness" as well. The deepest form of false consciousness is not simply passivity in the face of oppressive MANFRED STANLEY is associate professor of sociology at Syr- acuse University and research associate with the Harvard Pro- gram on Technology and Society.

What profit is there in gaining freedom from the direct fetters of political oppression (as in Latin America) only to lose it to the more impersonal demands of technical efficiency and instrumental reason (as may happen in the late-industrial democracies)? Let us examine technicism as a generic moral diagnosis of modern society in order that we may see in what ways Freire's understanding of literacy points the way toward possible im- munization against the most complex form of false con- sciousness. Many of those who damn what modernism has wrought do so from the conviction that modern society has somehow sub- ordinated human freedom to the dictates of man's own tools-his technology. From the political "left" to the political "right," in versions sophisticated and vulgar, this argument has risen in recent years to a crescendo. Yet despite the current, almost faddish, anxiety over the status of technology in mod- ern society, few people understand what is meant by a term like "technicism" beyond neo-Luddite fears of physical ma- chinery and its effects. There are many more people who are afraid of computers, for example, than there are who com- prehend arguments about the contemporary dominance of technique as developed by a Jacques Ellul.2 A technicist society is not one that is merely characterized by sophisticated technology, or even by an inordinate faith in technological capacities. A technicist society is one in which human reason is bent to the service of instrumental rationality. In such a society the "ends" or purposes of instruments are not subjected to intensive rational analysis on the public level. Rather, ends are either taken for granted, left for private determination, or articulated on a level so platitudinous as to be nearly irrational. Technicism, then, is a radical disjunction between the application of reason to means as against ends. In this sense technicism is becoming the dominant moral issue of our epoch. This may be said because the notion that the logic of techniques can organize human purposes rather than the other way around threatens the central proposition of Western humanism: the freedom of the human will under- May 1972 375</page><page sequence="4">Literacy stood at least as the relevance of nontechnologically inspired purposes for the organization of human society and collective effort. It is clear that any number of specific modes of social criticism take off from this generic diagnosis. Examples of such subordinate themes of criticism are attacks upon excessive bureaucratization, upon pollution of the environment, upon unlimited arms races, and upon the "gamesmanship" aspects of foreign and domestic politics. For present purposes it will suffice to synthesize four generic properties that have been variously alleged to define a tech- nicist culture.3 Dehumanized Definition of Objectivity One property of technicist culture is the domination of a worldview by a generally Cartesian notion of objectivity. In this tradition the world is fragmented. This occurs not because of the Cartesian emphasis on "clear and distinct ideas" (a general goal of all logic) but because of the reductionism implicit in Descartes's claim that the criterion of such clearness and dis- tinctness be grounded in geometry- measurable magnitudes as displayed by material objects. This concept of objectivity isolates the data of specifically human sensibilities and experience to the realm of subjectivity. With the decline of faith in the religious significance of inner experience the notion of subjectivity takes on an ever- increasing flavor of randomness and epiphenomenalism (as in the phrase "merely subjective"). One part of the world becomes objective nature, the categories of which are domi- nated by metaphors from the nonhuman realm of process (especially machines). The other part of the world becomes the domain of human affairs, with categories that appear in- creasingly vulnerable to deobjectification, even to the point of solipsism (clearly demonstrable in certain current styles of sociological theorizing). Since the seventeenth century, West- ern intellectual history has been in part characterized by struggles to reconcile these two domains, either by turning the world into mind (e.g., Hegel) or mind into matter (e.g., mate- 376 School Review</page><page sequence="5">Manfred Stanley rialism, social Darwinism, radical behaviorism). With the con- temporary decline of the category "matter" in favor of "energy," we find the struggle for a unified ontology taking its metaphorical categories from communications technology (cy- bernetics). The metaphors change but the problem remains. The Car- tesian tradition of objectivity does not adequately ratify the categories of fully human experience. As has been recognized by a number of scholars (Hans Jonas, Stanley Rosen, and the phenomenologists generally from Husserl to the present), there is a connection between this tradition and the contempo- rary crisis of nihilism as regards public consensus on values in Western civilization. For sociologists there is also a connection between all this and market liberalism. Liberalism is a mode of social organ- ization that is indirectly predicated on the assumption that no public consensus on values is possible other than civil liberties (which essentially protect the right to determine values on the private level). The debate over technicism partly reflects a reopening of questions which characterized the classical tradi- tion of political philosophy since ancient times. This reopening is being generated by the obsolescence of many basic liberal institutions (under the pressures of technological integration of society) and of liberal assumptions (under the pressures of such social science notions about man as socialization and cultural relativism). The significance of all this is that if people are encouraged by the assumptions in their shared world view to regard issues of values and purposes as nonobjective and private, then the vocabularies pertaining to these matters become regarded as not in the public domain, and thus do not receive public scrutiny and refinement. The result is decay in the precision of value talk from lack of care and cumulative development- decay that can only end with the reduction of logics of moral action to the status of platitudes and the reduction of quests for the meaning of experience to the pursuit of kicks. This decay is evident in the proneness of educated youth to the gnosticism and solipsistic egalitarianism implicit in such cur- May 1972 377</page><page sequence="6">Literacy rent social phenomena as the drug cults, the quasi-magical fads like astrology, and the irresponsibly utopian anti- intellectual fancies exemplified in much of the literature of the counter cultures. The point of all this for education is that whatever con- ception of the subject-object distinction is dominant in a par- ticular culture will help determine what is considered by people in that society to be meant by "cognition." Since Plato the debate over technicism has always affected education be- cause at stake in this debate is the question of what it really means to know something. Subjugation by Metaphor The second property of a technicist culture is the loss of intellectual mastery over metaphors in institutional life and public consciousness. Here we have reference to the long his- tory of metaphors, taken especially from mechanics, biology, and currently from communications theory, that have been drawn upon to describe and explain human action. Such meta- phors appear to most scholars as necessary for effective com- munication in science and other modes of discourse.4 Thinkers concerned about technicism have also warned, however, that such metaphors should not be used to conceal from the public the voluntary, constructive, personal, and spontaneous dimen- sions of human existence. Misuse of metaphors can, in time, erode the practical influences of vocabularies that seek to ex- press the uniquely human dimensions of experience and re- sponsible action. On the social level, the dominance of misused metaphors can facilitate the power of elites who define them- selves as expert in how the laws of the phenomena such meta- phors signify supposedly dominate human affairs. If the pub- lic is unaware of or forgets the metaphorical status of such lin- guistic borrowings from nonhuman domains, then such elites have their influence legitimated by nothing less than the pub- lic's prevailing view of reality. The price of this is social domi- nation by those who believe that a man really is a machine, or society an organism, or politics a self-equilibrating cybernetic communications network. 378 School Review</page><page sequence="7">Manfred Stanley The relevance of this for education lies in the fact that the cross-disciplinary influences of metaphors are often concealed by professional and hence curricular specializations. Further, the conception of what pedagogy should be fundamentally about is in part affected by what can be called the metaphorical condition of culture; that is, the sensitivity of the public at large about how they are using their language and how they are allowing it to be used on them. A lienative Specialization A third property of technicist culture is the character of specialization (the social division of labor) that arises in a culture dominated by instrumental reason and pseudoscientific use of metaphors. All societies have some division of labor. What is specifically important here is the basis on which spe- cialization is assumed to be legitimately predicated. As was well understood by both Adam Smith and Karl Marx, people have a tendency to reify the division of labor. That is, they tend to identify the human person (his qualities, capacities, moral worth, and sometimes his authority over one's destiny) with the person's function in the structure of specialization. In a society that is highly differentiated in its division of labor and is characterized by a culture that is technicist in orientation as this has been described here, people are increasingly tempted to assume that what specialized experts say and do reflects exclusive competence to define the phenomena that are un- der the purview of their expertise. Thus, just as I am ill because I have what the physician defines as my disease, or am nervous because I suffer from what my psychiatrist defines as my neurosis, so my national interests are what my government says they are; my enemies this year are those who foreign policy specialists say have aggressive intentions toward my sphere of influence; and the level of my education is what my diploma says it is. To the degree that this assumption about the exclusive competence of ever-increasing numbers of ex- perts to define reality is accepted by a population, to that degree we may speak of a technicist social organization. Regarding the connection between this point and education, May 1972 379</page><page sequence="8">Literacy it becomes clear that the debate about technicism applies not only to the categories of expertise but to the social organ- ization of professional specialization and the education pro- cesses whereby people are prepared for these specialized roles. Curricula deeply affected by specialization tend toward pre- senting the student with little more than compartmental- ized pictures of the world as seen by experts. This model of learning may be contrasted with an antitechnicist view of learning that stresses (1) how the experts' pictures of the world came to evolve that way, (2) the philosophical bases of claims to expertise and the counterclaims of dissidents, and (3) the con- tinuities between expert and nonexpert modes of theorizing (e.g., how we are all subject to selective reliance on faiths, myths, doubts, assumptions, and convictions derived from commonsense experience). Displacement of Personal Agency The fourth property of a technicist culture is the inevitable result of the previous developments. It is the mass dis- placement by a population of its freedom and responsibility for action from the personal level to the technical level as represented by society's technicians. This development is highlighted by the spread of a general apathetic illiteracy about the inner workings of one's own society. Insight into such workings becomes ever harder to achieve because of spreading enclaves of secrecy. These en- claves are generated both directly through deliberate security classification of information and indirectly through socially constructed mazes (red tape), through impenetrable technical vocabularies, and through proliferation of funtionally irration- al complexities (excessive technicalities). As this process of mystification proceeds, the public re- sponds with its own forms of silence.5 That is, the public's resignation to the dictates of expertise and its subsequent withdrawal into the private hedonisms of consumer existence seem accompanied by proliferating forms of refusal to endow the society at large with moral stature. We may note some of 380 School Review</page><page sequence="9">Manfred Stanley these forms of refusal here. They include stylish cynicism (refus- al of esteem to anything); internal flight, such as from cities to suburbs (refusal of participation in the solution of social prob- lems); voluntary ignorance (refusal of hope that to know any- thing is to be able to change anything); sabotage, such as "rip- ping off the establishment" (refusal of respect for public au- thority); spiritual neglect of one's children (in many cases a refusal of the parental authority to represent society and its values to children); doctrines of cultural revolution, including the trans- valuation of art through silence, apocalypse, and harlequinade (refusal of legitimacy to the mythological foundations of one's civilization). The relevance of all this to education is perhaps too obvious to require comment. The spreading revolt against schools, teachers, curriculum, and the established canons of knowl- edge, plus the cultic movements toward spontaneous learning which rest on an increasingly common confusion between edu- cation and the process of learning as such, all constitute evi- dence of a kind of populist antagonism toward a society whose moral credibility or even sanity people feel they have reason to question. Technicism and Education Perhaps the most starkly technicist definition of literacy to be found is the U.S. Army's notion of functional literacy set forth in World War II. Illiterates were defined as "persons who were incapable of understanding the kinds of written instructions that are needed for carrying out basic military functions or tasks."6 The quantitative criterion was fifth-grade equivalency. In the United States and fairly uniformly in the Western world, the definition of literacy is technicist in ori- entation. The U.S. Bureau of the Census defines illiteracy as "the inability to read and write a simple message in English or any other language."7 From these examples we may derive a pure technicist definition of literacy as follows: Literacy is (a) a technique of sign interpretation and reproduction that (b) is, in itself, mor- May 1972 381</page><page sequence="10">Literacy ally neutral to the same extent as a tool normally is; (c) capable of multiple applications, and (d) operationally defined accord- ing to the functions of sign interpretation and reproduction promulgated by those who consider themselves officially au- thorized to define literacy and are so accepted by others. Probably few definitions of literacy are as obviously tech- nicist as was the army's quoted above. Indeed, that is its virtue. Essentially what it says is that you are literate if you can obey our orders when they are written down. The difficulties with defining literacy begin when pedagogical or policy ambitions appear in some way to transcend the purely technicist ap- proach. When this is the case one quickly finds oneself in the no-man's-land between tools and philosophy. The pivotal problem may be seen clearly as lodged in one word found in our own definition: "interpretation." It is impossible to do without that word since, whatever reading is, it is irreducibly an example of interpreting signs. Consider three examples of attempted definitions of literacy that open a Pandora's Box of moral problems. In 1951 the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization Expert Committee on the Standard- ization of Educational Statistics suggested that "a person is literate who can, with understanding, both read and write a short, simple statement on his everyday life."8 In 1962 the UNESCO International Committee of Experts on Literacy adopted the following definition: A person is literate when he has acquired the essential knowledge and skills which enable him to engage in all those activities in which literacy is required for effective functioning in his group and community and whose attainments in reading, writing and arith- metic make it possible for him to continue to use these skills towards his own and the community's development and for active participation in the life of his country. In quantitative terms the standard of attainment in functional literacy may be equated to the skills of reading, writing and arithmetic achieved after a set number of years of primary or elementary schooling.9 In 1970 a definition of literacy not expressed in terms of 382 School Review</page><page sequence="11">Manfred Stanley grade equivalency was advanced at a U.S. planning conference on the "right to read" principle: "The challenge is to foster through every means the ability to read, write and compute with the functional competence needed for meeting the require- ments of adult living."'0 As long as such phrases as are italicized remain obscure (as to criteria of content, reference groups, moral philoso- phies, and relevance to theories of stability and change), these literacy definitions invite co-optation by elites able to enforce their own criteria-technicist or other kinds-upon people who can be compelled or mystified (as against rationally per- suaded) to accede to them.l" The range of disagreements that can result when people are invited to face such questions directly is well illustrated in the recent Harvard Educational Review issue on "Illiteracy in Amer- ica."'2 One finds here arguments ranging from the purest technicism to an outright attack on the notion that literacy should necessarily have anything to do with reading. Given the theoretically unsystematic, ahistorical, and often ideologically flamboyant nature of these discussions in which people seemed to talk past each other as often as with one another, it was not difficult to feel some sympathy for proponents of the solid technicist attitude embodied in Robert Laubach's frustrated comment at the symposium pertaining to the right-to-read goal: "It's already seven days into the decade and I'd like to ask you all what we have done tonight to take one step forward toward that goal, if anything, except talk about getting in- volved and a lot about the theory of thinking and all that kind of stuff."l3 That is the trouble with no-man's-land. One either stays on the side of well-defined technical efficiency (a difficult and quite proper task in itself), or one makes one's way through to a systematic larger view of what literacy really is in itself. In that case one finds oneself well beyond the confines of special- ized definition; one is in the domain of philosophical sociology. The no-man's-land is quicksand; there is no place to stand. For as someone trenchantly put it in the Harvard symposium, "Do you know anywhere in the world of a mass education system that is not geared to socialize its people to the status quo?"'l4 May 1972 383</page><page sequence="12">Literacy Sooner or later one must opt either against a given status quo or for it and its possibilities. Not to do either is to default on one's freedom of decision by means of technicism for the highest bidder. Let us turn now to conceptions of education on the larger or societal level of organization. Here the influence of technicist themes is harder to detect than when considering a single concept like literacy. What people call education is a complex multifaceted range of activities. Perhaps a technicist con- ception of education in the larger sense can best be defined by way of extreme examples such as the recent and influential work by Urie Bronfenbrenner, Two Worlds of Childhood: U.S. and U.S.S.R.15 It would be a mistake to view this work as one in the philosophy or sociology of education. It is not a work of philosophy because all its key philosophical terms are left abstract and undefined. The context of their use suggests that the author, in technicist fashion, accepts the authoritative definitions of philosophical and value terms extant in the polit- ical orders of the USSR and the United States. This is notable especially in Bronfenbrenner's use of the notion "superordinate goals."'16 Pointing to experiments that show group unification can result from the imposition of goals su- perordinate to all relevant parties, Bronfenbrenner recom- mends this finding as relevant to the United States, referring constantly to its use in the USSR. He seems unbothered by the fact that the latter, a totalitarian society, imposes loyal service to the state and to a totalitarian conception of society repre- sented in the flesh by the Communist party, as superordinate goals upon the young. In a tour de force of abstract human- ism, Bronfenbrenner proposes for the United States a super- ordinate goal designed to unify and integrate our children: the notion of social service (to the old, the young, the poor). Unmindful of the demonstrated irrelevance for the solution of American social problems of this VISTA-vision of social ser- vice, Bronfenbrenner does not concern himself with any fur- ther questions about why contemporary American middle-class society suffers from various social and emotional ills. Instead, 384 School Review</page><page sequence="13">Manfred Stanley he merely assumes that "it is participation in service to others that provides the most promising antidote for these social maladies."17 We find the same sort of approach taken toward terms like "fostering human development" which are left simply in their rhetorical form as the abstract goals of socialization, goals presumably to be defined by the authoritative agents of the status quo, or else-in some ecstatic moment of cooperative commitment-by everyone. In the name of these unknown authoritative goals, the educator becomes little more than a technician. Bronfenbrenner's language reduces the acts and events of childhood to "devices" that facilitate "processes" ("modeling, reinforcement, group commitment, involvement in superordinate goals, etc.").'8 These are themselves present- ed as abstract technical categories seemingly destined to fulfill their functions in the managerial design of socialization. Neither is this work a sociology of education. At no time are we told anything about the social, political, or economic organ- ization of the total society within which these educational prac- tices are embedded. Aside from one piece of evidence that he is speaking of Russia as a totalitarian society (a reference to informing on one's parents and friends for the benefit of the state),19 Bronfenbrenner's description could as easily have been of some cheerfully democratic-socialist society ex- perimenting with socialization practices optimistically designed to combine under modest central planning some aspects of collectivist values with the advantages of the private family. Nor do we find any indication that the United States is under- going a racking series of constitutional and ideological crises precisely over the meaning of "superordinate goals." It is thus not surprising to learn that, for Bronfenbrenner, the difference between the United States and Russia as concerns his topic is that "if the Russians have gone too far in subjecting the child and his peer group to conformity to a single set of values imposed by the adult society, perhaps we have reached the point of diminishing returns in allowing excessive autono- my and in failing to utilize the constructive potential of the peer group in developing social responsibility and consid- May 1972 385</page><page sequence="14">Literacy eration for others."20 How do we prevent ourselves from fol- lowing all the way the Soviet course of placing the collective over the individual and "shifting major responsibility for up- bringing from the family to public institutions"? We simply exhort Americans to remember their traditions of "neighborli- ness, civic concern, and devotion to the young."21 Thus do we discover, as so many have before, that to scratch a technicist is to find a preacher. Or, to put it another way, where in- strumental reason ends, sentimentality begins. A remark by Alvin Gouldner comes to mind as an appro- priate note on which to end this meditation on technicism in education. "The meaning of a rapprochement between Soviet and American sociology, or between Academic Sociology and Marxism, will depend greatly on the extent to which each is committed to an administrative or managerial sociology. An administrative sociology is essentially an instrument for mak- ing the status-quo better .... In short, an administrative sociol- ogy misses the nature of the competition and struggle between alternative solutions."22 We are now ready to consider a conception of literacy which points in a direction opposite from that of technicism. A liter- ate man in Paulo Freire's sense is not one trained to accept a world presented to him as disembodied signals, superordinate goals, and managerial socialization. Literacy in this perspective is not a technique at all- it is a quality of consciousness. Paulo Freire: Literacy as Authentic Dialogue To understand Paulo Freire's work it is necessary to see what he considers literacy and illiteracy to imply. For Freire, literacy is a totalistic quality of consciousness, not simply mas- tery of a morally neutral technique. Since it is meaningless to speak of consciousness itself as neutral (i.e., undirected, quali- tyless), it follows that no aspect of language as such an impor- tant mediator of consciousness can be regarded as without moral significance. Freire draws from this the inevitable con- clusion: "every educational practice implies a concept of man and the world."23 TO learn, as to teach, is an act. Freire's 386 School Review</page><page sequence="15">Manfred Stanley discussions of this point reflect awareness of the influence of instrumental reason upon contemporary conceptions of con- sciousness. He seems well aware of the subject-object problem as it pertains to education. "This process of orientation in the world can be understood neither as a purely subjective event, nor as an objective or mechanistic one, but only as an event in which subjectivity and objectivity are united. Orientation in the world, so understood, places the question of the purposes of action at the level of critical perception of reality .... Men have the sense of 'project' in contrast to the instinctive routines of animals."24 From this concern for the proper understanding of subjec- tivity and objectivity arise his persistent attacks upon what he calls the "banking" conception of education. He means by this the notion of learning whereby the learner simply digests knowledge. "Implicit in the banking concept is the assumption of a dichotomy between man and the world: man is merely in the world, not with the world or with others; man is spectator, not re-creator. In this view man is not a conscious being...; he is rather the possessor of a consciousness .... This view makes no distinction between being accessible to consciousness and entering consciousness."25 It follows from this that there is no such thing as a value-neutral literacy text or method. All words either conceal or reveal something. The essence of Freire's conception of literacy is found in this statement: "Teaching men to read and write is no... inconsequential matter... of memorizing an alienated word but a difficult ap- prenticeship in naming the world."26 This point, of course, raises the question of whether there are valid and invalid ways of naming the world. Freire ob- viously believes there is a valid way. "The role of the prob- lem-posing educator is to create, together with the students, the conditions under which knowledge at the level of the doxa is superceded by true knowledge, at the level of the logos.'27 What does he mean? Freire seems to mean two things by logos in this context. One is demythologized awareness, essentially a man's awareness of the true state of his position in the so- cioeconomic structure in which he is situated. He presumably May 1972 387</page><page sequence="16">Literacy has in mind here the opposite of the Marxian "false con- sciousness." The other meaning of logos is (in Freire's usage) more philosophical in tone: a man must understand his "on- tological vocation to be more fully human."28 This conception is never really explicated, but it would seem to refer to man's exercise of his freedom to name the world. For Freire, the phrase "to name" has a powerfully creative and transformative (world-constructive) connotation. All those who, knowingly or not, stand in the way of the progress of humanization in these terms constitute what Freire dubs the "oppressor." On the basis of what has been said of Freire's conception of literacy, we can readily understand his idea of who the illiter- ate is. First of all, illiteracy is "a typical manifestation of the 'cul- ture of silence' directly related to underdeveloped struc- tures.'"29 The illiterate is normally viewed as on the fringe of society, as marginal to the socioeconomic and political order. Often he is interpreted as being there by choice-as resisting literacy, or not having the will to learn. "In accepting the illiterate as a person who exists on the fringe of society, we are led to envision him as a sort of 'sick man,' for whom literacy would be the 'medicine' to cure him, enabling him to 'return' to the 'healthy' structure from which he has become separated. Educators would be benevolent counsellors, scouring the out- skirts of the city for the stubborn illiterates, runaways from the good life, to restore them to the foresaken bosom of happiness by giving the gift of the word."30 Freire rejects this concept of marginality out of hand. Rather than "beings outside of," illiterates are "beings for another," that is, they are uncon- scious of the internalized oppressor within them. This in- ternalized oppressor is a composite of the assumptions about the poor and the powerless held by those who rank high in the social structure and reap its benefits. In many cases, the pow- erful and the powerless share a mythologized sense of the social order as in the "nature of things"-a natural order of superiors and inferiors. Thus the illiterate, among the most powerless and helpless of men, does not realize that "men's actions as such are transforming, creative, and re-creative." 388 School Review</page><page sequence="17">Manfred Stanley Therefore literacy training will simply not take hold, will not engage the action capacities of men, unless such training re- lates "speaking the word to transforming reality.'" Technical Principles for Literacy Training Such is the philosophic basis of Freire's approach to literacy. He has developed a series of technical principles for literacy training whose rationale is grounded in this perspective. The overall purpose of these techniques of "problem-posing educa- tion" is the achievement of "authentic dialogue" between educator and learner. By this term Freire means dialogue that enables the illiterate, in terms meaningful to him, to discover the oppressor within him, to cast off his "mythical" false con- sciousness, and to achieve his "ontological vocation" as a cre- ative agent. This agenda presupposes stages of preparation. The first stage is "thematic" investigation, by which Freire apparently means intelligently conceived and executed anthro- pological research on the objective situation and the phenom- enal world of the illiterate group being worked with. "The task of the dialogical teacher in an interdisciplinary team working on the thematic universe revealed by their in- vestigation is to 're-present' that universe to the people from whom he first preceived it-and 're-present' it not as a lecture but as a problem."32 The translation into a problem that the illiterate can under- stand (including his own place in it) proceeds by way of collec- ting a number of "generative words"- words which, having been derived from within the illiterate's own phenomenal world, lead him to ask an expanding series of questions about his existential situation. Gradually "generative themes" emerge as the illiterate becomes literate and able to put words together into more complex combinations of ideas. Together, always in dialogical manner, educators and learners move through the literacy materials (words, texts, pictures) gradually "decoding" them. These literacy materials, or "codifications," are not "slo- gans; they are cognizable objects, challenges towards which the critical reflection of the decoders should be directed."33 May 1972 389</page><page sequence="18">Literacy Ideally, codifications are organized as thematic fans, that is, in mosaics of themes that suggest each other in multiple pos- sible patterns. The outcome of these processes should be the learner's progressive induction into awareness of the con- tradictions that constitute his societal environment culminat- ing, of course, in his comprehension of how he-a creative agent- could have been made a being outside of society. Freire's book cites a few instances of technical research in progress on varying styles of codification, thematic presenta- tion, and dialogue. But directing all the technical consid- erations is the underlying perspective on a free man's onto- logical vocation. Thus the book goes to considerable lengths to distinguish between truly revolutionary dedication to "the people" and authoritarian teaching, between propaganda and codifications, between manipulation and education, between true and false revolution. Any meaning of literacy short of liberation in these terms constitutes, for Freire, not social de- velopment but cultural invasion. A Commentary on False Consciousness It has been argued here that, despite Freire's preoccupation with political oppression, his thought is applicable to a whole range of issues connected with false consciousness. By false consciousness is meant a psychic condition in which the role of the self's agency (volition, creativity, responsibility) in the pro- duction and maintenance of the social world is obscured by interpretations of reality which conceal or disguise these dy- namics from the self. Technicism - the mass loss of insight into and control over the disposition of techniques in social life-has been cited as one fundamental form of false con- sciousness and its relevance to education illustrated. Critiques of this sort are often seen as pitched on a high level of philo- sophical abstraction - what the "practical" man likes to dismiss as pure "theory" if not "mere rhetoric." Freire's attack upon the established notion of literacy has posed the issue in a way very difficult to dismiss as impractical. To be told that one's ways of educating and being educated 390 School Review</page><page sequence="19">Manfred Stanley produce stunted human beings, helpless before an inscrutable though man-made environment, strapped into unnatural strata of power and subordination, and mystified by in- stitutionalized mythologies, is to feel called upon for a practical reaction. And if one can succeed in demonstrating that the most powerless and marginal of persons (functionally illiterate peasants) can be inducted into a life of responsible praxis, then one has cause to believe it can be achieved with anyone, de- spite the celebrated failures and costs of formal education efforts. Freire's work is not only an indictment of established educational practices. It is also a powerful vote of confidence in what can be called the humanistic possibilities of correct methods of educational intervention into even the most de- graded circumstances of false consciousness and social oppres- sion. Given such stakes, it is obviously important to develop cri- teria for assessing the arguments of radical educational think- ers such as Freire. If carefully articulated, such criteria can serve as a basis for cumulative progress toward the reconstruc- tion of a sociologically viable philosophy of public education which is so badly needed in societies that still stress the dignity of the person as a responsible agent. Three interrelated criteria seem particularly appropriate. First, is the argument for a radical change consonant with evidence adequate to assess it (the criterion of evidence)? Sec- ond, is the argument based upon the conviction that some precisely specifiable alteration of a given social practice will conclusively resolve the moral problems defined in the critical diagnosis of existing society that led to the new proposals (the criterion of utopianism)? Third, is the argument adequately elaborated in terms of its practical implications for the socio- cultural order at large (the criterion of refinement)? Let us apply these criteria one at a time to Freire's thought. Evidence The credibility of Freire's methods is implied by anecdotal accounts of peasants in various places in Latin America (Brazil May 1972 391</page><page sequence="20">Literacy and Chile) being taught to read in a very short time. Naturally any progress of this sort is to be welcomed. However, Freire claims to represent more than humanitarian anecdotes of progress. He is claiming for this method of literacy training a revolutionary capacity to mobilize radical praxis among the most "unreachable" people in the world. Given the philosoph- ical underpinning of his approach to literacy, this alleged capacity constitutes a serious test case of Freire's whole view of human possibilities. It follows that judgment about his specific claims should be suspended pending systematic study of his methods' efficacy in various settings. This will be difficult to implement widely, given the apparent acceptance (to judge from Freire's exile status) by governmental authorities of Freire's own claims for the subversive significance of his doc- trines. Experiments based on such new doctrines of literacy are reasonably achievable projects in liberal-democratic so- cieties where political oppression is not of the kind Freire experienced in Latin America. But precisely because of the much greater complexity and subtlety of the moral problemat- ics of false consciousness in democratic societies, even the stipulation of criteria for what would constitute evidence in favor of Freire's perspectives is much harder than in situations of almost self-evident oppressive inequalities. It would perhaps be unfair to expect Freire to address such problems of evidence. Yet the profound philosophical under- pinning of his literacy doctrine suggests that he considers his views on the meaning of literacy to be of universal sig- nificance. Certainly the effort here to translate his views into the context of technicism as a mode of false consciousness reflects my own conviction that Freire's position is relevant to industrialized democracies. Clearly those of us who share Freire's hope that an antitechnicist mode of literacy is both possible and sociologically efficacious face severe problems of evidence. Utopianism Utopianism is, in my opinion, a problem in Freire's thought. It is evident in an uncritical tendency to regard his notion of 392 School Review</page><page sequence="21">Manfred Stanley literacy as the key to liberation and a life of praxis for all men. This is to say that apparently he does not take much note of the complexities, much less the dark side, of the notion of liberation itself. Let us enlarge on this point by way of three examples. We shall consider (a) the ambiguities in liberation defined as men's realization that they make their own nature and their world; (b) the issue of hidden elitism; and (c) the problem of chiliastic impatience. In his magisterial intellectual history of theory and practice as concepts, Nicholas Lobkowicz reminds us of the following. Giambattista Vico, the last great heir to the ideas of Renaissance Neo-platonism, defined man as a posse, an indefinite nature able and thus also forced to determine himself. It should be noted, however, that prior to the nineteenth century this exaltation of man's capacity of determining himself usually was not paralleled by any significant enthusiasm as to man's capac- ity to grasp the theoretical secrets of the universe or even his power to master nature by his inventions. In fact, it usually was linked with a basic skepticism as to the force of natural reason. And later, Lobkowicz adds: It was not until Hegel and Marx that philosophers began to realize that the same notion could be extended beyond the realm of "doing" to the realm of "making," from the realm of ethics and politics to that of economics and technology. As far as I can tell, no one before Hegel, and in a sense no one before Marx, ever claimed that man can transform himself by transforming the material world. But as soon as this idea emerges, the role tradi- tionally played by practice, in the sense of ethico-political doing, will decrease until in Marx it completely gives way to the notion of homo faber creans seipum.34 From these comments we may infer four quite different ways of asserting that men determine their nature and their world, each way possessing moral implications unique to itself. First, one may say that men invent their conduct and gener- ate the coordinates of the human world (language, arts, sci- ences, artifacts) but are helpless to do so in a deliberate way according to plan. One contemporary exemplar of this point May 1972 393</page><page sequence="22">Literacy of view, for example, is Leslie White who insists upon a dis- crete discipline of "culturology," the study of culture as a sort of independent variable.35 For White, awareness of the role of culture in human existence may legitimately be regarded as an important source of insight into historical changes, and hence as a resource for more intelligent adaptation, but it hardly justifies ecstatic dreams of liberation into some state whereby men can control the evolution of their civilization in any way they happen to please at a given moment.36 In this context one might well conclude that effective praxis is not revolutionary action but rather the maintenance of conditions in which the influence of critical awareness on the evolution of culture can be kept at a maximum.37 A second way one may assert the proposition in question is to say that men invent their world through trial and error by way of processes that-if men are left alone to rationally pur- sue their interests-are far more benign in their results than could be said of any product of deliberative design. This is the central faith of Anglo-Saxon utilitarian liberalism. To those who share it, praxis consists largely of encouraging the condi- tions for a free market, including consumer sovereignty in economic production and political choice. Inevitably one is then heir to the well-known tensions that exist between the humanistic emphases on liberty and equality of which de Tocqueville was such an acute prophet. A third interpretation, one of rather tragic grandeur, is the notion that men create their world only in rare moments of true praxis under the impetus of charismatic inspiration. With the routinization of charisma that inevitably follows, the logic of the factual world, so to speak, has its own impersonal way once more. Such a view, exemplified best in modern times by Max Weber, lends itself to the notion of praxis as clearing the way whenever possible for fresh episodes of charismatic re- newal. In the name of this abstract goal one could advocate anything from resistance against excessive bureaucratization to frankly romantic rejection of modern rationality pending the advent of new Caesars and Messiahs. Finally, it could be said that men are destined one day to 394 School Review</page><page sequence="23">Manfred Stanley evolve into true freedom whereby they consciously and coop- eratively appropriate the world and transform it into a struc- ture designed for optimal human fulfillment. As phrased, this is an expression of Marxist humanism. But from Saint-Simon to modern would-be policy science, a far less romantic and more elitist technocratic version of this interpretation of praxis also exists.38 We thus see that literacy defined as awareness that men can make their world is philosophically an insufficiently explained legitimation of a revolutionary-oriented literacy training. There is another sense-the sociological-in which the no- tion that men make their world is not explicated in Freire's work. The search for a scientifically viable notion of freedom that regards men as capable of defining and inventing their world is high on the agenda of some scholars today. Efforts to define freedom in this way must contend with the arguments that regard freedom as accompanied inevitably by anxiety associated with the temptations of unlimited aspirations and unexpected frustrations. Those who bid us to revolution in the name of freedom must make their case in a way that is credible to people who have lived through a half century of ideolog- ically inspired terrors. This is a particularly important require- ment when the revolution being urged has ambitions beyond those of the traditional utilitarian liberal-democratic thrust for economic and political melioration.39 Having reviewed the first problem pertaining to the definition of liberated praxis, we turn now to the second: the issue of hidden elitism. Hidden elitism hovers behind any theory of false con- sciousness; he who understands the dimensions of true con- sciousness, whatever they are, must necessarily - however tem- porarily - play the role of an elitist guiding the unenlightened to their proper destiny. Freire appears to accept this elitism for his educator, as we see in his almost religiously inspired prescription for this personage, "Conversion to the people requires a profound rebirth." Ironically, this allows his teacher to bask within the historical afterimage of dedicated mis- sionaries, the most really sophisticated of whom all understood May 1972 395</page><page sequence="24">Literacy the technical psychology behind Freire's program of literacy training quite well. Freire's views, as we have seen, place an extraordinary emphasis upon education as the instrument of liberation. If Freire were to carry the matter, further and admit that social mobilization of large numbers of unenlightened people is also necessary for revolution, Leninism would have to be the next step in his thinking. Under such conditions of mass mobilization, both church and secular history suggest that the saintly educators whom Freire depends on to keep his revolution honest would turn out to be in short supply. More fundamentally, the risk of unadmitted elitism stalks anyone who insists on using the term "myth" to characterize per- spectives with which he disagrees. No faith perspective on what it ultimately means to be fully human (including the antitechnicist perspective to which this writer subscribes) is completely immune to the challenges of philosophical and historical relativism. That is to say, there is no way in which intellectual criteria can be used to demonstrate conclusively the timeless validity of one set of moral axioms against all others. This understanding has led to a new respect for the role of myth in social life. It is, of course, likely that Freire is well aware of such problems and would apply the term "myth" only to almost self-evident justifications of social oppression. Indeed it would not even have been necessary to make this last point were it not for a conspicuous failure on Freire's part to attempt a more universally relevant definition of "oppression" in his book. As it stands, his approach to this concept is dangerously abstract and rhetorical. Somewhat special circumstances char- acterize social stratification in Latin America. Application of his ideas in the developed Western world and other parts of the Third World could have tragically irrational results. Ex- treme circumstances (e.g., ignorance, helplessness of peasants, internalization of ruling-class contempt) that would justify an all-out revolutionary policy whereby people are encouraged to act such that "the oppressed must see examples of the vulnera- bility of the oppressor so that a contrary conviction can begin to grow within them"40 simply are not equally distributed 396 School Review</page><page sequence="25">Manfred Stanley throughout the world. Yet Freire writes as if they were. Fur- ther, Freire's very definition of oppression as "as any situation in which 'A' objectively exploits 'B' or hinders his pursuit of self-affirmation as a responsible person"41 skirts dangerously close to the totalitarian doctrine of the "objective enemy" which Hannah Arendt so rightly excoriates. "The chief difference between the despotic and the totalitarian secret po- lice," she writes "lies in the difference between the 'suspect' and the 'objective enemy.' The latter is defined by the policy of the government and not by his own desire to overthrow it. He is never an individual whose dangerous thoughts must be provoked or whose past justifies suspicion, but a 'carrier of tendencies' like the carrier of a disease."42 Finally, there is the problem of what we have called chiliastic impatience. To put it briefly, Freire seems to place all his hopes on educational enlightenment about the true nature of human agency. Nowhere does he seem to consider the possi- bility that a significant proportion of people might come to reject such radical freedom in favor of benign authoritarian- ism and aesthetically tinged mystifications once they dis- covered that radical praxis meant hard work, unrationalized frustrations and "too many evenings." Radicals generally are not wont to consider with sympathy the arguments made by Dostoevski's Grand Inquisitor. Yet as much evidence surely exists for this interpretation of human beings as for any other. To be liberated into discovering the often humdrum facts of one's normal humanity could well induce a kind of indefinitely destabilizing chiliasm in intelligentsias who refuse to cease their quest for the Holy Grail of human perfectability. Again, it may seem almost vulgar to bring forward such considerations under the conditions of Latin American and many other Third World societies. But Freire aspires to a universally relevant theory of revolutionary literacy training and, in the name of his vision of liberation, he tends to down- grade revolutions powered by lesser aspirations. Is it not nec- essary (even perhaps in such oppressive societies) at all costs to avoid dividing the population into simplistic dichotomies of "oppressor" and "oppressed" as though some utopian Ar- May 1972 397</page><page sequence="26">Literacy maggedon were possible that would finally purify the realm of all vestiges and versions of the ubiquitous oppressor? In such an artificial polarization, most of us not capable of some maso- chistic renunciation of our traditional identies might well find ourselves in the oppressor class. Refinement Freire does not go far at all in ramifying sociologically the practical implications of his literacy program for the larger orders of society and world. There is much risk in heeding the call to cultural revolution without benefit of such refinement. We will not spend much time with Freire on this topic because his attention was focused on the issues immediately surrounding adult literacy training. However, as we have al- ready implied, much refinement is necessary and possible for Freire if his ambition is the development of a universally relevant radical theory of literacy as an instrument of social change. First, if carried to its absolute, logical conclusion, Freire's theory of literacy as an instrument of social change requires a virtual commitment to social development as persisting revolu- tionary destabilization rather than as any kind of recapitula- tion of Western modes of social evolution. This is because (especially if the government itself is not a left-humanist re- gime) not all sectors of the population can simultaneously be made literate in Freire's extreme sense. People's capacities, experiences, interpretations of life, and drive differ too much. Further, it is very likely that people's responses to such a form of "awakening" will vary. They will range from the utilitarian egoism appropriate to a liberal order, through communalist fervor appropriate to a socialist order, to apocalyptic en- thusiasms appropriate to mass cults. In other words, Freire's literacy will not mean the same thing to all people. Freire seems to assume it will and has nothing to say about how such profound energies, once liberated, are to be structurally chan- neled so as to avoid both the destructiveness of persisting 398 School Review</page><page sequence="27">Manfred Stanley destabilization and the recapitulation of past forms of oppres- sion. Second, we have already commented on the dangers of applying a simplistic oppressor-oppressed dichotomy even to heavily caste-stratified societies, much less to other parts of the world. Yet this dichotomy plays an important role in Freire's literacy theory. One cannot help wondering if Freire is unnec- essarily inviting exile. Finally, the notion of a fundamental and universal "new-man" literacy is itself not new. The task for a radical analysis of literacy in these terms is to evaluate the religious and secular history of such efforts in the past, and, on that basis plus studies of contemporary experiments, introduce a much more refined analysis of the new-man concept and its possibilities under varying conditions.43 To do this, however, will require unashamed confrontation with the elitist implications of new-man literacy doctrines. His- tory does not make us sanguine about the efficacy of Freire's call to "revolutionary trust" in the people. On the contrary, it rather seems to prepare us for, in Carl Bereiter's words, "something of a paradox: the most important educational goal of free men is one that men will not pursue of their own free will."44 One may, of course, respond with a flat assertion of a contrary faith as Everett Reimer does: "I believe.. . that a proper organization of society could make available to every- one the circumstances that only scientists now enjoy and that under these conditions everyone would find the pursuit of reality natural and enjoyable."45 But it is surely not unreason- able to ask that one prepare to be wrong, and to decide whether in that event it would be the elitist or the relativist chips one will let fall where they may. The analysis thus far has articulated a view on the universal significance and the existing limitations of Paulo Freire's thought on literacy. The efforts of a sociologist to contribute to the cumulative historical conversation on education would be insufficient without some conception of the durable universal sociological questions that must be addressed by anyone wishing May 1972 399</page><page sequence="28">Literacy to enlarge Freire's position on literacy into a comprehensive philosophy of education. Some Sociological Problems for a Philosophy of Education Ideological issues aside, let us contemplate for a moment a universal sociological definition of literacy implied by a non- technicist perspective like Freire's. Literacy may be thought of as the minimal capacity both to understand the moral implica- tions of and to act upon the demands of competence for what a particular society defines as responsible participation of the person-as-agent in nature, society, and other persons. This seems almost identical with the 1962 UNESCO definition of literacy quoted above. There are slight but impor- tant differences in emphasis signified here by the stress put on the person-as-agent (hence on responsible participation), and on the integral nature of participation as a concept (i.e., it involves a view of what it means to live and act in nature, and in other persons as well as in something called a group). This definition, then, reminds us that-however ultimately interpreted in mythological and moral frameworks - there are certain demonstrable, primary, and universal facts about hu- man beings as they appear in relation to any society. 1. All humans are beings whose consciousness is formed by having been socialized into a given society. This society brings to bear upon them certain expectations whose fulfillment re- quires competencies. All societies make an effort to transmit aspects of some or all of these competencies through the socialization process. 2. All individual human beings must experience the world in a manner somewhat unique to each one. Hence all social norms are open to some degree of interpretation. The "fit" between person and society is therefore never perfect. All persons have a certain latitude of freedom to accept, modify, or reject the interpretations of reality, definitions of com- petence, and expectations for action that authoritative agents of society seek to impose upon them. This freedom, rooted in the aforementioned lack of perfect fit between individual and 400 School Review</page><page sequence="29">Manfred Stanley society, is enforceable at least-if in no other way-by the individual's willingness to choose death over conformity. This is the universal minimal basis for the assertion that all persons are responsible agents and can never be validly regarded only as tools or products. 3. Whether a society formally recognizes this fact in its system of socialization or not, all human beings inevitably participate in nature directly and indirectly, and in the fate of a wide range of other persons, as well as in the more- organized processes of group life. This process of participa- tion always exceeds in complexity the institutionalized norms of participation and related competencies that a society estab- lishes for purposes of socialization. Short of some in- conceivably perfect totalitarianism, no society can ever pre- scribe modes of participation in such a way that the results of human action upon nature, society, and other people will be perfectly predictable. What this all adds up to is that, unlike what the UNESCO definition may seem to imply, a person can never be definitively regarded as "literate," only as more or less so. Further, it can never be objectively clear at any given moment what essential knowledge and skills really are, nor what effective functioning in group life finally is. This emphasis on the unstable, dynamic, and imperfect character of literacy definitions may seem, and really is, a truism. But it is precisely the drive to express literacy operationally in quantitative terms (skill tests and school levels achieved) that obscures some of the most perplexing problems that a society faces when it seeks to decide what it means to be minimally competent, or literate. Making people literate must surely include bringing them to understand what these problems are and why they are often perplexing or not conclusively answerable. Another way of saying this is to remind ourselves that to become literate is to learn as much about anxiety as about adjustment. It should not be difficult to deduce from these comments what some of the central durable sociological issues of educa- tion are. 1. Socialization is a universal phenomenon; education as a May 1972 401</page><page sequence="30">Literacy more formal institution is not. Education in the highly differentiated sense of structured schooling is even less com- mon. What are the constraints placed upon fulfilling educative functions that flow specifically from the various possible ways in which the separation of education and socialization may evolve in a given society? For example, a society whose author- ity is modified by radical cultural pluralism cannot effectively (i.e., beyond the level of platitudes) utilize a specialized public educational system for moral (as against skill) socialization. To do so would violate that society's basic consensus about the prerogatives of public as against private domains. 2. Is there anything that all members of a given society should or must be required to know as a prerequisite for recognized membership in the society in its dimension as a moral community? Are there specific conditions under which the communal competencies of a population must be strength- ened as a requisite for the continued survival of the society? One example of such an issue is the educational questions that flow from nation-building efforts in the developing countries of the non-Western world. Another example is the apparent necessity to induce new levels of literacy about communal standards of stewardship over the natural environment in wealthy societies that-in the name of private pursuit of in- terests- have permitted the pollution of their environments to a point of common danger. 3. There is a universally relevant distinction to be made between an educative context as action and an educative con- text as thought. The contemporary uncritical emphasis on theory as something to be translated into practice obscures a fact that was more clearly appreciated in premodern societies than in our own: there are certain vitally important things that cannot be taught on the level of theory. This fact leads to the universally relevant educational question of how much any given society should emphasize the transmission of literacy through educative action as against didactic verbalization. This question transcends abstract platitudes about learning by doing. It touches on profound matters like the educative sig- nificance of rituals, rites of passage, and the problems of 402 School Review</page><page sequence="31">Manfred Stanley translating into universalizing educative language the curricu- lum of life's vicissitudes. One example of such considerations is the present American debate over the proper status of Peace Corps and VISTA-type experiences in the educative process. Another example is the Chinese debate on the educative sig- nificance of Cultural Revolution episodes. 4. Another question whose significance was understood in premodern societies somewhat better than in our own grows out of the obviously universal importance of the double nature of all men-the intellectual and the emotional dimensions of being human. Accordingly it may be asked: to what extent should a society institute an educative program for the dis- ciplining of the emotions that is in some ways functionally equivalent to "logic" as the educative language of the intellect? The current neglect of this question in most Western societies (except perhaps in military contexts) should not obscure its importance or the likelihood of its being reopened. Forces that will probably lead to the revival of the question include the seemingly incredible failures of intercultural comprehension revealed by data like the Pentagon Papers; the strange propos- als by some prominent figures such as the use of drugs to domesticate aggression among political elites, or the appli- cation of operant conditioning principles to whole popu- lations; the growing preoccupation with the meaning of the totalitarian episodes of the present century; and the educative implications of laboratory tests showing that self-control of the autonomic nervous system is technically feasible. 5. One of the central features of modern scientific secular- ism is the fragmentation of the world into two alleged realms: the factual and the moral. This fragmentation is linguistically expressed in our educative terminology as the disjunction be- tween the "empirical" and the "normative." Yet recent scholar- ship has increasingly stressed the enduring importance for societies and persons of what are commonly called "mytho- logical" orientations. These are perspectives on reality that, while outside the strictly factual domain, are nonetheless vitally important influences upon a population's sense of what is meant by reality, truth, time, worth, etc. The question that May 1972 403</page><page sequence="32">Literacy follows from this is: to what extent is it either desirable or possible to attempt a total separation of the empirical and the normative as regards mythological themes in the educative processes of a given society? This issue transcends in complexity and subtlety most of its current doctrinal formulations such as the one of separation between church and state. By way of example I shall cite two of the deepest normative questions embedded in Western civ- ilization's mythological representations. On the rhetorical level we encounter these in (a) the tensions between the principles of "authority" and "liberation," and (b) the confusion over the status of the concept of "progress." The problematics of liberation and authority have received important sociological formulation in the writings of Karl Marx and Emile Durkheim, respectively, specifically in their discussions of alienation and anomie.46 Anomie is Durkheim's sociomoral diagnosis of a society characterized by a population prone to unlimited aspirations. Alienation is Marx's diagnosis of a society characterized by social processes that result in mystifications which conceal from a population the facts of its own agency in the creation of the social world. A voluminous literature of ideology inspired by these formulations has emerged in recent generations. Should a society seek to make such key formulations part of its program of moral literacy training? This question applies likewise to the problem of how to deal with the despair that inevitably attends crises of confidence surrounding a society's eschatological myths. In the West this is now an issue because of a declining faith in the definability of "progress." Should the teaching of eschatology -its relations to the dynamics of hope and despair, and its connections with the mass movements of yesterday and today - be an important part of a society's established educative efforts? Is the price of not doing so a possible or even inevitable relapse into conflicts between official technicist abstractions about necessary super- ordinate goals and counterculture rhetorics of mindless ecsta- sy? 6. The last question to be considered here is one deriving 404 School Review</page><page sequence="33">Manfred Stanley from the universal fact that all educative contexts are em- bedded in larger institutional environments of social regu- lation and control. The question: to what extent should educa- tive practices be uncritically subordinate to the central values of these larger environments? The example utilized here is the influence of the market economy upon a liberal society's notion of value and the im- pact of this notion of value upon education. The major direction of influence that a market economy brings to bear on values is, of course, their translation into marketable com- modity forms. This is clearly evident with respect to the values of knowledge and vocation. A major way that knowledge as a commodity appears in the educative context is in the in- stitution of the mass-marketed textbook. A major way in which the market interpretation of vocation appears in the educative context is the confusion between the myriad meanings of voca- tion and the idea of education as preparation for the job market. It is easy to show that the mass-marketed textbook operates to seriously distort the meaning and significance of ideas. It is likewise easy to demonstrate that the job mentality corrupts the nobility of some powerful alternative notions of what vocation is all about by making them appear as abstract platitudes. The question is to what extent should the educative process be deliberately designed to counteract (and hence con- ceivably undermine) the dominant values of the larger envi- ronment- in this example, those inspired by the market econ- omy? This is no different from asking, "What is the proper relationship between education and social criticism?" Put still another way, should education have something to do with inducing literacy in subordinate or alternative norms and val- ues as well as dominant ones? If so, along what range of variation? Such questions as we have outlined here are not subject to definitive answers in anything short of a totalitarian context. Indeed, functional literacy in a modern complex democracy may well have to be defined first of all as the competence of a population to comprehend and participate in answering these questions in relation at least to the details of their own lives. May 1972 405</page><page sequence="34">Literacy For however their content may vary, in form these are ques- tions that derive from the perennial social and psychic charac- teristics of society as such. In more visionary terms, a popu- lation capable of understanding such issues in comparative perspective and detail would indeed qualify as literate on a highly cosmopolitan scale. It may well be that the creation of an international civil service will present the first real oppor- tunity for the operationalization of a mode of literacy in these more advanced senses. Ironically, given the rigidities of educa- tional practice in the established societies, innovation along such lines may actually proceed more rapidly one day on the international than the national level.

Students of the sociology of knowledge would have interesting things to say about the implied contrast here of two social origins of efforts in literacy training. The "medical" approach is appropriate for literacy specialists who come out of the mission field. Until very recently missionaries, of course, saw themselves as bringing enlightenment, civilization, and salvation to those without these. Freire's orientation, on the contrary, is appropriate to the social outlook of rising ex-colonials developing a revolutionary consciousness of the world influence of imperialism.

The limitation on aspirations inherent in the fact that any imagi- nable solution of existing conditions of deprivation can only be replaced by new experiences of deprivation is explored in my "Structures of Doubt: A Conceptual Study in the Sociology of Change," in The Sociology of Knowledge ed.
