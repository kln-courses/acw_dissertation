<plain_text><page sequence="1">INDRA, A TRIBAL HERO WHO BECAME A GOD [Summary] Kalyan K. Ganguli Of the hymrfs which form the collection of the Rig-Veda, by far the largest number (as many as 250) are found dedicated to the invocation of Indra, the redoubtable god of the Vedic pantheon. Though quite a lot has been known and said about him already by scholars interested in the Vedic lore much sfeems to remain uninterpreted about the origin and evolution of Indra as a god. The Rig-Veda knows the numbers of the gods to be 33 a figure given also in the Iranian tradition; but the number of gods actually mentioned in the Rig-Veda exceeds this number of thirty-three. The Brahmanas first systematised the list of these thirty-three as to include eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, twelve Adityas and Indra and Brahma being the remaining two. The Satapatha gives Dyaus and Prithivi as the thirty-second and the thirty-third. The Niruktas reduce the number to three, Surya in the heaven, Vayu in the</page><page sequence="2">88 INDIAN HISTORY CONGRESS air and Agni on earth, occasionally replacing Vayu by Indra. The gods mentioned in the Vedic tradition were all in harmony with Nature and phenomenons of Nature; but Indra breaks this harmony; he shattered the chariot of the Dawn, warred against other gods, became drunk taking great draughts of soma and in feat of drunkenness could do anything immoral, even kill his own father. It is natural enough to believe that the original great god of the Aryans was Varuna and only later was Indra made to replace Varuna in the Indian tradition. Yacobi thought that Indra was of Indian origin though we know that the Mitanni knew him already in 1600 B.C. Of all the gods in the Rig-Veda Indra seems to have been endowed with the utmost of human qualities and his anthropomorphism does not appear to have proceeded from phenomenal abstraction and through theriomorphism of the Vedic type. He assumes the position of Varuna as king and snatches away the wheel of Surya to become the omnipotent If different deities were held in highest esteem by different groups of people Indra had become supreme with most of the important kings mentioned by the Rig- Veda such as Divodasa and Sudas. By the time of the Atharva Veda Indra is deliberately placed above all other gods to become the supreme. He has been mentioned as Kausika or the family god of the Kusikas to which belonged Divodasa and Sudasa all whose victories were won with the active help of Indra. Later we find the rulers of the clan of Divodasa get consecrated as Indra (Aindrabhisheka). A closer study of all these material would reveal that the original Indo-European tradition did not know of any god as Indra; the name Indra does not give out any traditional meaning but appear more as a personal name; he was a heroic character full of virtues and vices more in keeping with human nature than with that of other Vedic gods; he assumes the place of Varuna and Surya and Vayu to be ever existent and all pervading; he is the family god of the Kusikas, that of Divodasa and Sudasa. Indra's son Kutsa mentioned to have been born of his thigh, has been considered as a real hero. Consequently Indra may also be considered as having been a hero of a particular clan, that of the Kausikas with whom had merged the Bharatas, the Purus and the Kurus already by the time of the Vedas. The memory of Indra by that time had become dim as a real person but had not already developed into that of a god equal or similar to other gods of the Rigvedic pantheon.</page></plain_text>
