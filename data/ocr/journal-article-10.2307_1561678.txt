<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DEATH OF OSIRIS IN AENEID 12.458 Joseph D. Reed As aeneas ranges the battlefield in search of Turnus and the Aeneid storms toward its close, an odd note sounds. A Trojan named Thymbraeus slays a Rutulian named Osiris. Neither is mentioned before or again. Even when one considers the diversity in this poem of names of Italian warriors, which Virgil takes not just from Italian traditions but from all over the Mediterranean world,1 Osiris is surprising. Why does the name of an Egyptian god intrude into a primeval scene of Roman origins? The reader cannot ignore this provocation, especially on recol- lecting the rich patterns of meaning that such a contemporary of Virgil as Tibullus works into his elegy on Messalla's birthday through an invo- cation of Osiris.2 So unexpected is the name that Bergk emended Osi- rim to Osinim, recalling the Italian king Osinius mentioned at 10.655.3 But emendation is misguided: as this paper will argue, the suggestive- ness of the name is satisfied on the levels of history, ideology, religion, and literary influence, all major domains of Virgil's epic. And the slay- ing of Osiris by Thymbraeus can be shown to emblematize both the whole mission of Aeneas and the achievement of Augustus. Aeneas, cured of the wound on his thigh, arms himself and, with some final words of instruction to his son, goes into battle seeking Tur? nus. In a memorable simile, he is compared to a storm that brings hor- ror to farmers and ruin to their crops. His example rouses his fellow Trojans against the Italians: ferit ense gravem Thymbraeus Osirim, Arcetium Mnestheus, Epulonem obtruncat Achates Ufentemque Gyas; cadit ipse Tolumnius augur, primus in adversos telum qui torserat hostis.

The adjective is equivalent to fortis, according to Servius Auctus; Forbiger prefers a de- notation of towering size, comparing gravis as epithet of the boxer En? tellus at 5.437 and 447.4 "Massive" might capture the sense in English. The effect here is to highlight Thymbraeus' prowess. Like Osiris, two of the other Italian victims, Arcetius and Epulo, are unknown except for this passage. (The important Ufens received six lines at 7.744-49, in the catalogue of Latin allies,5 and Tolumnius, as line 461 reminds us, began this phase of the battle at 12.257-67.)6 But both their names etiologize some ancestral Italic or Roman institution: Epulo suggests a prototype of the college of epulones, priests of Jupiter Epulo;7 Arcetius invites a connection with the Italian gens Arquitia.8 In this they are like their en? emy Mnestheus, supposed eponym of the gens Memmia (5.117). Osiris stands alone among his compatriots in his nomenclatural irrelevance to anything Roman. But Thymbraeus shares the isolation of his victim: he is the only one of the Trojans here who is mentioned nowhere else; not only that, but Mnestheus, Achates, and Gyas are indeed famous, lead- ers of the Trojans throughout the poem, receiving notice during the in? troductory storm scene in book 1, the departure from Carthage in book 4, the games in honor of Anchises in book 5, and elsewhere. The cata? logue here is introduced by a pair of unknown warriors. The two belong together and give each other meaning. If the name of Osiris applied to a follower of Turnus reduces the critic to perplexity and silence, we can approach its significance through that of the name of Thymbraeus, which has obvious relevance to the whole drift of the epic. Thymbraeus reprises a Thymbraeus killed by Diomedes in Iliad 11.320-21, also mentioned only once. Virgil has revived the obscure Tro? jan, as it were, to permit him the victory at last; the fact that each Thym? braeus is hapax legomenos in his epic reinforces the reference, espe? cially for such learned readers as Virgil himself was and expected in 4Forbiger 1875, 575-76; cf. Henry 1889, 296-97. 5Ufens also appears at 8.6, 10.518, and 12.641. He shares his name with a river in Latium: 7.802. 6In fact, 12.461 echoes and compresses 12.258 and 266.

In fact, the mythological tradition preserves de? tails that give this place especial significance for the outcome of the Trojan War: there, it was said, Achilles slew Troilus and was later slain himself.11 Virgil's Thymbraeus thus carries connotations of Trojan de? feat and victory that make his victory here the more meaningful. The name has already occurred at 3.85, where Aeneas in the temple of Apollo on Delos addresses his prayer for a permanent new home to "Thymbraeus," that is, Thymbraean Apollo, so called from a local shrine of the god.12 A Trojan warrior Thymbris mentioned at 10.12413 bears the same connotations of the old homeland, the old patron gods, the world that the Aeneadae have left behind and hope to rebuild in some new form. But the meaning of Thymbraeus' name within the topographical schemata of the Aeneid is still more complex. Virgil gives the River Ti- ber any of three names, accounted for by Servius on 8.31: in sacris Tibe- rinus, in coenolexia Tiberis, in poemate Thybris vocatur. In his explana? tion of the first term Servius is at least partly right, since the god of the Tiber, the river personified, is several times called Tiberinus.14 And Ti? beris is of course the common name of the river. Thybris, however, needs further elucidation. The name, beginning with theta and upsilon, is distinctly Greek-sounding (its declension is also Greek),15 though it may owe something to Etruscan toponymy.16 Neither meter nor tradi- 9Cf.

VIA.l (1936) 697. Wag- ner (1891, 401) thinks that the siting of Troilus' death near the Thymbraean shrine of Apollo goes back to the Epic Cycle. 12See K. Ziegler in RE Suppl. VIA.l (1936) 694-97. The cult is first attested in Eur. Rhes. 224 and 508, which no doubt allude to or derive from Dolon's mention of Thymbra in //. 10.430. On Aeneas' prayer Forbiger (1875 ad loc.) gets the point: "Thymbraeus vo- catur Apollo tamquam patrius Troianorum deus"; cf. Harrison 1984, 488; Fo 1990, 179. 13 On the derivation of his name see Saunders 1940, 544. uAen. 6.873, 7.797, 8.31; in 7.30 Tiberinus used of the river itself lends an image of personification not alien to Virgil (see, most elaborately, the man-mountain Atlas in 4.246-51). 15Cf.Meister 1916, 58-59. 16 E. Fraenkel in RE XVI.2 (1935) 1656, s.v. "Namenwesen."</page><page sequence="4">402 JOSEPH D. REED tion requires Virgil to use it; it does not occur before him in Latin po? etry, or within his work before the Aeneid (Tiberis occurs in Georg. 1.499).17 In the Aeneid the river is Tiberis once, at 7.715, in a catalogue of Sabine allies rich with geographical and etiological lore: among the ar- rivals are "those who drink of the Tiber and the Fabaris." Here the plain Latin name suggests the homely indigenes of the spot and their river- drinking ways.18 Every where else the Roman river is called Thybris,19 even by the river god himself at 8.64. At 8.72, tuque o Thybri tuo genitor cum flumine sancto, the Grecizing form replaces the Latin in a borrow- ing from Ennius (Annales 26 Skutsch), teque pater Tiberine tuo cum flumine sancto. At 8.330-31 Evander derives the name from a King Thy? bris of the post-Golden Age, tacitly contradicting another story, re- tailed in Livy 1.3.8, that traces it to an Alban king Tiberinus. Virgil does not explain whether Thybris and Tiberis are simply al- ternatives, or whether the ordinary name is supposed to derive from Thybris, as Roman gentilic names derive from those of Aeneas' com- panions Mnestheus, Sergestus, and Cloanthus in 5.116-23. What is of most interest to our inquiry is that the name of the River Tiber is con- stantly made to approach that of Thymbra, the village of the Troad whose Apollo Aeneas invokes on Delos, and more specifically to a river near Thymbra called Thymbris or Thymbrius.20 It was at the mouth of the Thymbris, where it joins the Scamander, that the shrine of Apollo was situated; here the deaths of Troilus and Achilles took place.21 The phonetic similarity sets up an implicit connection between the Anato- lian and Italian rivers?one might even say an identification, with the 17Meister 1916, 53-60. "Thybris" appears in [Virg.] Cat. 13.23; cf. Carcopino 1968, 506 n. 6. Later Latin poets use it more and more frequently; in Greek it is attested in both poetry and prose (cf. n. 20 below): see Meister 1916, 61-70, who finds Virgil's source in an oracle reported by Phlegon (Macr. 4) and Zosimus (2.6). 18Cf. Meister 1916, 54; Carcopino 1968, 512-14. ?Aen. 2.782, 3.500, 5.83, 5.797, 6.87, 7.151, 7.242, 7.303, 7.436, 8.64, 8.72, 8.86, 8.331, 8.540,10.421, 11.393. See Carcopino 1968, 505-11. 20In some Greek authors (cited by Meister 1916, 62; add Steph. Byz. s.v.) the Tiber is actually "Thymbris."

Plutarch (Rom. 1.1) calls the Tiber "Thymbris" in an account of Rome's Trojan founders, doubtless pointedly. Herodian (1.99 Lentz) mentions Roman and Trojan Thymbris jointly. 21Strabo 13.598; Hesych. and Suda s.v. OujipQig; Steph. Byz. s.v. Oi^Pqcl</page><page sequence="5">THE DEATH OF OSIRIS IN AENEID 12.458 403 "m" serving as a kind of optional marker.22 A Rutulian warrior named Thymber, killed by Pallas at 10.391-94, is surely meant to recall the Thy- bris and reinforce the identification.23 This name-play, of course, sup- ports the dual patriation that the Aeneid claims for the Aeneadae and their Roman heirs; or rather, it represents the two homelands, Trojan and Italian, as mystically one and the same. Seen against these cross- references interwoven into Virgil's text, Thymbraeus is not just "the man of Thymbra" but also "the man of the Tiber." His name looks both to the past and to the future. Even as he slays his foe at 12.458, Thym? braeus represents the unification of Trojan and Italian that will fulfill Aeneas' mission and eventually produce Rome. Here we begin to discern the ideological program completed by the name of Osiris. If Thymbraeus, by an etymological game, represents the dual heritage of Rome, then it makes sense for his opponent to bear the name of an Egyptian god, representative of a land neither Trojan nor Italian, but quintessentially un-Roman, especially since the Egyp? tian war of the late 30s and the anti-Cleopatra propaganda of Octavian. The associations of the two names move us from the literal level of the fight to an allegorical level of national identity (Trojan versus Italian) and thence to a secondary allegory in which Thymbraeus is a proto- Roman and Osiris is the enemy of all things Roman. One especially recalls the Battle of Actium as depicted on Aeneas' shield: it is a divine as much as a human battle, in which the gods of the Romans?above all Apollo, the especial patron and protector of Octavian?set to flight the omnigenum deum monstra that attend and succor the Egyptian fleet (8.696-706). Only the dog-headed Anubis24 is mentioned by name there (latrator Anubis at 698); at 12.458 the name of Osiris, the only other occurrence of an Egyptian divine name in the Aeneid, sends us back to the end of book 8 and to Augustan propaganda.25 Below its sur? face, this is a battle of the 30s b.c.e., not of the heroic age. 22See Kretschmer 1909, 295 n. 1; Montenegro Duque 1949, 76-77. That the near- homonymy suggests identity is supported by the fact that Thybris and Thymbris are vari? ants for the name of a place in Sicily and, in one myth, of the nymph who bore Pan; see Meister 1916, 62 n. 4; Gow on Theoc. 1.118.

REED Once we have recognized this opposition in 12.458, many more connections suggest themselves, leading us deeper into the web of the poem's ideology and securing more tightly the symbolic function of the two warriors. Thymbraeus represents the Roman and Osiris the Egyp? tian qua non-Roman; so far that much is plain. But the topographical associations that give Thymbraeus his ethnic complexity, evoking both Anatolian Thymbris and Italian Tiber, operate for Osiris too. The river we would immediately associate the Egyptian god with is of course the Nile, and to a long tradition Osiris was the Nile. "Father Nile," incants Tibullus, "Egyptian youth sing of you and do you homage as Osiris."26 If we permit this identification to operate in 12.458, we should recall that the Nile has twice been mentioned in the Aeneid as metonymic for Egypt as enemy of Octavian's Rome: at 6.800, where Anchises predicts that already the Nile, along with other regions, trembles at the approach of Augustus Caesar; and at 8.711, where the grieving river receives the defeated Egyptian army into his bosom after Actium. So the riverine as? sociations of Thymbraeus spotlight those of Osiris and link 12.458 to the poem's most vivid prophecies of Augustus' ultimate triumph. The divine associations of the two names, too, reinforce the ideo? logical opposition. If for a reader of the Aeneid Thymbraeus will call to mind Apollo, then Osiris will call to mind Bacchus, who was identified with the Egyptian god at least since the time of Herodotus.27 The iden? tification is persistent and widespread, and was weil known to Romans of Virgil's time.28 Apollo, of course, was the tutelary god of Augustus; Bacchus, of Antony. Their gods were not only patron deities but models to be imitated in costume, or borrowed from in other symbolic ways; the practice falls into a pattern of close association between a Roman leader and his god in this period (Sextus Pompey and Neptune provide another example).29 Antony cultivated Bacchus as his patron and divine 26Tib. 1.7.23-28.

Koenen 1976, 144-47, on Tibullus' assumption of his readers' familiarity with it. 29Zanker (1988, 44-53), speaking of "rival images," discusses the propaganda bat? tles of the 40s and 30s in terms of warring divinities. Cf. Becher 1965, 44, on the post- Actium propaganda: "Der Kampf [between Octavian and Antony] wurde retrospektiv zu einem Kampf zweier Gotterparteien umgewertet und in die Sphare gottlicher Ent- scheidungen geriickt."

In Rome the new persona was exploited by Octavian and his partisans, who found it easy to invoke long-standing suspicion and fear of Bacchic mystery cults as dangerous and un- Roman, not to mention the drunken debauchery implied by the Bacchic model, against which Octavian could cultivate an image of Apollo? nian?and eminently Roman?sobriety. Antony's play with personae was a calculated and traditional ma- nipulation of metaphors. One thinks of Thomas Mann's analysis of an? cient imitation, and his observation that the ancient ego was somehow "open from behind" and borrowed from past models the strength to confront present situations.33 Moreover, this political masquerade relied on an awareness that the referent of every metaphor can itself be a metaphor; thus through linked chains of models Antony picked up qualities incidental to his immediate precursor. When he entered Ephe? sus as Dionysus he was not just Dionysus but also Alexander, projecting a different, but overlapping, set of attributes and inspiring different, but related, expectations in his beholders. Through Alexander in turn he in- vited comparison with other Roman generals who had taken Alexander as a model: Marius, Pompey, Caesar. In this respect his appearance be- 30/G II2 1043.22-23. See Raubitschek 1946; Pelling 1988, 179-80, 209; Brenk 1992, 175 n. 33. 31 The assimilation of Alexander the Great to Dionysus, which became a topos of Alexander-literature, seems to go back at least to Clitarchus in the years just before 300 b.c.e; Nock 1928, 26-30. Alexander himself may have taken the god as a paradigm: see Fredricksmeyer 1997, 102-6. 32Plut. Ant. 24. 33Mann 1960, IX 495-96, from the lecture "Freud und die Zukunft" (delivered in 1936). Mann touches on our subject: "Alexander ging in den Spuren des Miltiades, und von Casar waren seine antiken Biographen mit Recht oder Unrecht iiberzeugt, er wolle den Alexander nachahmen" (496).</page><page sequence="8">406 JOSEPH D. REED fore his soldiers as Bacchus was not careless, but shrewd, as long as they could draw the proper links between the explicit and implicit models. But how does one limit one's interpreters, or call a halt to the racing linkages of meaning that one has set in motion? Antony's swarm of Dionysian personae proved too semantically volatile to control. Zanker speaks of him as "betrayed by his own image," and even the defense he circulated under the title De Ebrietate Sua (Plin. NH 14.148) may have backfired in Rome.34 In Egypt, however, after his affair with Cleopatra settled him there, Antony's worship of and identification with the god needed no apology and risked no misunderstanding; indeed, they were almost in- evitable. He did not just cultivate Dionysus; his patron god was spe? cifically Dionysus as Osiris, granting him the legitimacy of a quasi- pharaoh,35 consort to Cleopatra, whose image as Isis was traditional.36 Antony posed for paintings and statues as Dionysus-Osiris, together with Cleopatra as Selene-Isis.37 Here the Roman triumvir was taking a hint from the Ptolemies, no doubt provided by Cleopatra; in fact, it is reasonable to guess that he would have ineluctably melted into the role of Osiris the minute he first appeared at Cleopatra's side, so compelling and capacious was the symbolic machinery of the Ptolemaic court.38 For three centuries a Greek system of thought had been superimposed on a no less deeply rooted system many times older; the resulting language of images could assimilate anyone and anything that it had a use for, en- dowing them with a double-edged potency. The paintings and statues of which Cassius Dio speaks were certainly no society portraits, but monu? ments of court propaganda, comparable with the reliefs in Cleopatra's 34Zanker 1988, 57-64. 35Koenen (1993, 61-62) notes the assimilation of Ptolemaic royal couples to Osiris and Isis, after native tradition. Cf. Nock 1928, 33; Pelling 1988, 180: "as Cl.'s consort [An? tony] naturally filled the role of Dionysus-Osiris: Ptolemaic kings had come to identify themselves with the god, just as their queens were regarded as Isis." On Antony's assimi? lation cf. Jeanmaire 1924, 247-48. 36On the assimilation of Ptolemaic queens to Isis, evident from the early period of the dynasty, see Fraser 1972,1 238-46. 37Cassius Dio 50.5.3.

Brenk (1992) shows that in the Life of Antony Plutarch constructs his story of the tragic romance using Isiac imagery, no doubt out of familiarity with Ptolemaic practice.</page><page sequence="9">THE DEATH OF OSIRIS IN AENEID 12.458 407 shrine of Hathor at Hermonthis that assimilate the queen and Cae- sarion to Isis and her infant Horus (here it would not be amiss to recall Horus' role as avenger of his dead father, Osiris).39 There is no reason to ascribe to Antony himself, rather than to the hierarchs of Alexandria, the deliberate iconographical operation that made him into Osiris, al? though he must have approved the result. It is likely that Octavian's propaganda made as much of the "barbaric" Osiris as of Dionysus when smearing Antony for his divine patronage; Cassius Dio puts such a smear into the mouth of Octavian, perhaps with pro-Augustan litera? ture as his source.40 Virgil the poet is playing the same game of linked metaphors as Octavian and Antony the politicians did. Beneath the names of Thym? braeus and Osiris, pitted against each other in the last battle of the Ae? neid, two lists of opposing terms unroll, each pair representing a the? matic level of the poem on which the same battle is being played out, with Roman supremacy the ultimate prize: Rome versus Egypt, Tiber versus Nile, Apollo versus Bacchus, Octavian versus Antony. The verti- cal dynamics of the chart so created meld the different terms into op? posed identities; its horizontal dynamics lock those identities into an unequal agon whose outcome is inevitable. The grand prolepsis of the whole epic is miniaturized here, as the shadowy combatants gather to themselves implications that will make sense only after August, 31 b.c.e. Aeneid 12.458, heading a list of Rutulian defeats that prefigure Aeneas' triumph over Turnus, itself prefigures Actium and the Augustan tri? umph of which Aeneas' victory is only the harbinger and prerequisite. Here we can perhaps set ourselves hermeneutic limits of the kind Antony could not impose on his audience. How far has it gotten us to identify Osiris the slain Italian with the Egyptian god of his name? That is to say, what unexpected chords in the poem do we strike when we set out (no more than heuristically) to identify our Osiris as the god and read the Egyptian myth into Aeneid 12.458? That is the touchstone, for unless we can claim actually to have struck chords already in the Ae? neid, the multifarious associations that we uncover in the names of Thymbraeus and Osiris will be to no avail. That they are all there in the text is unquestionable, but unless the identifications with Thybris, Thymbris, and Nile; the connections with Apollo and Bacchus, and their 39Grant 1972,100. 4?Cassius Dio 50.25.4, 50.27.1; see Becher 1965, 42-43; Brenk 1992,163.</page><page sequence="10">408 JOSEPH D. REED roles in Roman politics; and the other motifs we have been pursuing resonate meaningfully in the poem, they tell us little or nothing about the Aeneid. When even contradictory suggestions both resonate, on the other hand (when Thymbraeus, for example, melds both Trojan and Italian personae even as he bears down on an Italian warrior), neither can be excluded from a critical purview. The meaning of the death of Osiris is not simply the sum of its intratextual connections, waiting to be added up and neatly decoded. One hesitates to speak of a "code" here at all; a more dynamic concept of meaning is preferable. The meaning of the passage lives in its metaphors, and takes its only strength from theirs. Some connections ring flat, at least to our ears. By the Hellenis? tic period the divine epithet Thymbraeus and the Thymbraean cult of Apollo had special connections with the story of Laocoon: the author of a hexameter fragment, apparently Nicander, refers to Apollo under that title as the sender of the sea serpents (SH 562), and surviving commen? taries make Laocoon a priest of Thymbraean Apollo, name one of his sons Thymbraeus, or site the deaths in the Thymbraean shrine.41 The importance of Laocoon in Virgil's version of the fall of Troy makes us take eager notice of this connection, but since Virgil ignores or contra- dicts all of these known versions, it is hard to see how Thymbraeus in 12.458 adds anything to Laocoon in book 2, or vice versa. At most, per? haps, Aeneas' prayer to "Thymbraee" on Delos could meaningfully re- prise a prayer by Laocoon in some now lost poem, but it would take the recovery of such a source to send us from 3.85 back to book 2 and thence forward to book 12, where Laocoon's fate could be avenged, in some sense, by his god's namesake.42 Another lead that is difficult to pursue is the slaying of the Iliadic Thymbraeus by Diomedes, Aeneas' old adversary, who is prominent in Aeneid 11. Although the allusion in 12.458 weaves Diomedes into the poem yet again, the association be- 41 Servius on Aen. 2.201, attributing the story to Euphorion (fr. 70 Powell); Hyg. Fab. 135; schol. Lycophr. 347. 42Virgil had already referred to Thymbraean Apollo at Georg. 4.323 (Aristaeus to his mother), si modo, quem perhibes, pater est Thymbraeus Apollo. Commentators are not helpful on the connotations of the epithet here, but Thomas (1988 ad loc.) suggests a Hel? lenistic source on the death of Troilus. An anonymous referee for this Journal notes the close connection of Aristaeus' bougonia with the Nile; Virgil's line might thus be very Alexandrian not only in its use of Homer (cf. Od. 9.429 as well as //. 10.430,11.320), but in its subtextual representation of the Greek world as like, yet unlike, Egypt?framed, of course, by the Roman perspective of the poem.</page><page sequence="11">THE DEATH OF OSIRIS IN AENEID 12.458 409 tween the two episodes does not seem to do more than reconfirm the reversal of Trojan fortunes. On several levels, then, the antithesis between Thymbraeus and Osiris allegorizes the triumph of Aeneas and the future Roman na- tion. Yet as with so much of the pro-Augustan content of the Aeneid, the battle between Thymbraeus and Osiris, on all levels a seemingly straightforward triumph of both Aeneas and (proleptically) Augustus, is not without ambivalence. The Egyptian gods routed at Actium, as de- picted on Aeneas' shield, are "monster-forms of all kinds of gods." But Osiris is no dog-headed Anubis. Along with Isis, he is the Egyptian god least susceptible to dismissal as a barbaric "other," an anthropomorphic deity with strong and venerable connections with the Olympians. His mysteries are part of the cult of Isis, long accepted in Greco-Roman re? ligion and established in Rome itself since the second century b.ce.43 As one might expect, the cult was especially associated with the com? mon people, and opposition to it with senatorial interests, but it served the political semioticians of the late Republic in various ways. Isiac im? agery appears on Roman coins starting in the 80s, seemingly in con? nection with antisenatorial political activity.44 Augustus' own policy con? cerning Isis was quite flexible, marking her cult as fundamentally un-Roman but respecting its popularity and worthy associations.45 With the other triumvirs he decreed a temple to Isis (Cassius Dio 47.15), no doubt to advertise his popular sympathies; in the 20s he expelled Egyp? tian cults from within the Pomerium as a sort of compromise (Cassius Dio 53.2.4, 54.6.6). In this time and milieu, Osiris is at best an ambiva- lent symbol of the anti-Roman. Moreover, in his myth, a basic form of which even a modestly learned Roman reader will have known, Osiris is of course killed, and so the killing of Rutulian Osiris in the Aeneid irresistibly invites com? parison to that of his divine namesake. And the slayer of Osiris in Egyp- 43 Cf. Heyob 1975, 21: "The calculated absence of the names of Isis, Sarapis, and Harpocrates [in Aen. 8.696-706] should here be noted. Such propaganda would not be ef? fective if a god who was so popular were ridiculed." On the other hand, Cleopatra's pa- trium sistrum in 8.696 unmistakably assimilates her to Isis (cf. Servius ad loc), and Anubis too had a role in the Isis cult. It might be better to say that opposition to the Isis cult is in the Aeneid for those who seek it, but is muted?much as in Augustus' own policy toward the cult. 44Alfoldi 1954; Heyob 1975,15-18. 45For surveys of Augustus' attitude and its antecedents see Heyob 1975, 19-22; Koenen 1976,132; Ciceroni 1992, 106.</page><page sequence="12">410 JOSEPH D. REED tian mythology is the evil Seth, identified by Greeks and their Roman cultural heirs with Typhon (at least in this myth).46 An equivalence be? tween Typhon and Thymbraeus is thus embedded in our passage, mak? ing the Apollonian Trojan champion on one level, at least, the image of the monstrous son of Earth, enemy of the gods and of order. This equiv? alence would raise no more than a passing twinge of ambiguity, a mere suggestion of doubt and reversal, but for the other references to Typhon that Virgil includes in the poem, intimately bound up with a pervasive cosmological program that uses the myth of Gigantomachy to further the epic's themes. Among other uses, Typhon underlies descriptions of Turnus and Cacus, two notable villains of the poem.47 And yet as Har? die observes, there is no stable Gigantomachic "code" beneath the ac? tions of the poem, clearly marking this or that side as good or evil. The Gigantomachic imagery at the close of book 12 that casts Turnus as a monstrous evildoer and Aeneas as an avatar of Jupiter, parallels and in a sense rectifies an earlier battle, in 9.691-716, where the Trojan Bitias is likened to Typhon and Turnus slays him with Jovian, lightning-like mis- siles.48 In 10.565-70 Aeneas in his battle-rage is explicitly compared to the hundred-handed Aegaeon, ranged on the side of the Giants against the thunderbolts of Jupiter.49 Hardie well resists the tendency to resolve such ambivalence as an assurance that "both sides are violent," or as a reminder that the Italian war is proleptically a Roman civil war in which neither side escapes the guilt of sacrilege; rather he would defer the am? bivalence back to the myth itself, "where the distinction between two types of opponents, gods and Giants, is often weak."50 In 12.458 this same mythological program is played out on a tiny scale. The name of Thymbraeus' opponent and victim draws them both into this flickering play with mythological personae; like his commander Aeneas, whose ul? timate victory his own foreshadows, Thymbraeus is assimilated to the side of the Giants. 46Explicitly in, e.g., Diod.

Aegaeon here recalls the hundred-handed Briareus, whose mention in 6.287 alongside the Chimaera at the entrance to the Underworld leads us to Turnus and the Chimaera on his helmet, as weil as to the imagery Virgil uses for the fire- breathing Cacus. Aeneas is thus momentarily ranged with an overdetermined assortment of his enemies. 5?See Hardie 1986,153-55.</page><page sequence="13">THE DEATH OF OSIRIS IN AENEID 12.458 411 It is the persona of Osiris himself, however, that lends most am- bivalence to our passage. For in death the Egyptian god is a figure of sympathy, a type of dying god recognized by the Greeks and Romans, whose best known example is Adonis. It is not surprising that Osiris is often identified with Adonis, first that we know of in the time of the sec? ond Ptolemy, when poets attach to the state-sponsored Adonia an Osirian procession down to the sea with an effigy of the god.51 Most ger- mane to our inquiry is Parthenius' reference to "Adonis of Canopus,"52 which locates Adonis at the site of the most famous Ptolemaic cult of Osiris-Serapis. Parthenius, of course, was an influence on Virgil and his contemporaries; even if one doubts Macrobius' report that Parthenius himself taught Virgil Greek literature,53 the connection is attested in an imitation of Parthenius in the Georgics54 and indirectly by Parthenius' dedication of his Erotika Pathemata to Virgil's friend and fellow-poet Gallus. Adonis himself was usually said to have been killed by a boar while hunting, and this event is treated sympathetically in all the ac? counts we have of it,55 including those from the Latin poetry of Virgil's period and slightly later, where the emphasis is on the grief of Adonis' lover, Venus.56 These poets ennoble the death of Adonis as a tragic event, as do Pompeian wall paintings (LIMC LI 226 no. 35) and as will sarcophagi some centuries later. In art earlier than Virgil, we have an Etruscan sarcophagus adorned with a sculpture of the dying Adonis, at- tended by his dog (LIMC 1.2 165 pl. 33). Here too Adonis is implicitly a reminder that beloved and beautiful young people die; observers are meant to extrapolate his well-known qualities for the deceased. 51 Reed 1995, 320 n. 18; cf. Plut. De Is. 356c and the Old Kingdom ritual texts cited by Griffiths (1980, 75). I am preparing a fuller study of this syncretism, which is likely to have been based on practice. For a late Hellenistic reference to Osiris' sea voyage, see Damaeus' poem from the Sarapeum at Thessalonica (IG X.2, 108.5-6), discussed by Bin- gen (1972). 52SH 654. Parthenius' mention of Adonis here may have been part of a longer treatment of the myth of Adonis, known to us from SH 641. 53Macr. Sat. 5.17.18. Scarcia (1983) casts doubt on the story; Dyer (1996) finds reason to trust it. 54 Georg. 1.437 ~ Parth. SH 647. Dyer (1996, 22) detects the influence of Parth. SH 646 in Georg. 4.457-61 and Aen. 12.601-4, and there must be many undetected echoes. Aulus Gellius (9.9.3) names Parthenius in a list of Greek poets imitated by Virgil (the oth? ers are Homer, Hesiod, Apollonius, Callimachus, and Theocritus). 55Reed 1995, 336-37. 56Prop. 2.13.53-56; Ovid, Am. 3.9.15-16, Met. 10.708-39.</page><page sequence="14">412 JOSEPH D. REED So even if we look away from the position of Osiris in Isiac cult and attend only to literature and iconography, it is likely that the Ro? man reader would have received the death of the god Osiris with sym? pathy, situating it in a tradition of poignant, regrettable divine death. These are the feelings that will have been evoked by Aeneid 12.458. One would perhaps go too far were one to attribute to the unembellished character of Virgil's Rutulian Osiris the youth and lost promise that made untimely death an especially tragic event for Romans, and that they saw in the death of Adonis; nevertheless, those connotations most certainly resonate for the reader who would pursue them. For they would assimilate Osiris to a type of dying youth that recurs in the Ae? neid, a beautiful young warrior imbued with the melancholy of lost promise, whose examples include Euryalus, Nisus, and Pallas and whose Augustan avatar or correlative is Marcellus in 6.860-86.57 On the enemy side one can name Lausus as part of this group and recall the strong sympathy channeled toward his death by Aeneas' speech (note espe? cially Aeneas' apostrophe miserande puer at 10.825, repeating Anchises' words over Marcellus at 6.882).58 And 12.458 will also insinuate an ele? ment of sympathy for the victim even in the righteous triumph of Tro? jans over perfidious Rutulians. The mythological death of Osiris, of course, abets Trojan victory by making the death of the Rutulian Osiris seem inevitable. Anyone named Osiris is going to be unavoidably dead: his penumbra of helpless- ness makes Thymbraeus' victory seem a foregone conclusion.59 At the same time, however, these mythological overtones let in yet more con? notations, some of which redound to the disadvantage of Thymbraeus and to the greater ambiguity of the passage. One cannot unravel even an implied reference to Typhon from the Gigantomachic imagery that Virgil has so carefully woven into his poem; and in view of his mytho? logical connections, the very passivity of Osiris attracts our sympathy, not our contempt. 57This type has often been noticed, most recently by Hardie (1994, 25) and Petrini (1997, passim). In many respects Camilla and Turnus exemplify it as weil. 58 Aeneas is about to use the phrase again, of Pallas, at 11.42. 59 A striking parallel to Virgil's use of Osiris here is Ap. Rh. Arg. 1.1044, in just such a catalogue of slayings as ours: a Dolion killed by the Argonaut Clytius has the name Hya- cinthus, which recalls another cult-mythological death and lends the same sense of doom. The Apollonian line may indeed have initially prompted Virgil to name one of his own slain after a dying god, although Osiris seems to have more extensive meaning in the Latin poem than Hyacinthus in the Greek.</page><page sequence="15">THE DEATH OF OSIRIS IN AENEID 12.458 413 Another passage of the Aeneid that resonates against 12.458, af- firming some of its themes in all their ambiguity, is 6.791-805, one of the poem's key prophetic moments, where the shade of Anchises reveals to Aeneas the coming glory of Augustus. He will restore the Golden Age to Latium; he will extend the Roman empire eastward, even to the Par? thians and Indians; even the Nile trembles at his coming (800, a line we have already glanced at). Then Augustus is compared to two other conquerors: nec vero Alcides tantum telluris obivit, fixerit aeripedem cervam licet, aut Erymanthi pacarit nemora et Lernam tremefecerit arcu; nec qui pampineis victor iuga flectit habenis Liber, agens celso Nysae de vertice tigris. (801-5) Encomia topically compare Alexander the Great to these gods,60 and so Virgil is assimilating Augustus to Alexander as conqueror of the East, like other Roman generals before him. R. D. Williams recognizes three points to the comparison: "(i) they all made their influence felt over large areas; (ii) they were all connected with civilising activities; (iii) they were all mortals destined to become gods."61 And yet the apt- ness extends more deeply into the political aspects of the passage. It is not a coincidence that the two gods to whom Augustus is compared are the very two whom Antony cultivated and emulated. On their surface these lines slight the Antonian gods' imperial prowess in favor of Au? gustus' (nec... tantum). There may be a dig here at the failure of An- tony's Parthian campaign, especially if this passage postdates Augustus' recovery of Crassus' lost standards in 20 b.c.e. But in a deeper sense, Augustus is not contrasted with Hercules and Bacchus; he does not merely surpass, but usurps their greatness. It is as if with the victory at Actium and the suicides of his opponents, Octavian were going to take on Antony's role, becoming a sort of improved Antony, a super- Antony who is a worthier heir to Alexander. That is why these lines leave behind everything Roman and judge Augustus in terms of the Greek East?Antony's terms. The ideology of the passage is not one-sided. To be sure, Hercu? les' slaying of the hind of Ceryneia (wherein Virgil seems to follow Eu- 6?Norden 1899, 470 (= 1966, 425). 61 Williams 1972, 509.</page><page sequence="16">414 JOSEPH D. REED ripides' story that the hind was a menace exterminated by the hero)62 recalls 1.184-94, where Aeneas saves his crew by bringing in seven stags; the identification Hercules-Augustus-Aeneas that this intratextual link suggests fits most comfortably in the iconography of the Aeneid. The only other female deer in the poem, however, is the one to which Dido in her pathos is likened, the doe shot unawares and left to die (4.69-73, with the same verb, figo, as here); 6.802 thus recalls both positive con- notations of Aeneas' leadership and negative connotations of the hu? man cost of his success. The image of Bacchus coming down from Nysa at 6.804-5,63 reining in wild tigers with his vines, foreshadows Amata's bacchanals in book 7 (pampineis links 6.804 with 7.396). And why is it the septemgeminus Nile whose mouths are disturbed by prophecies in 800? The distinctly Catullan epithet sends us back to its Catullan con? text (11.7-8), where the Nile caps a list of Eastern lands and peoples? the Indians, Hyrcanians, Arabs, Sagae, and Parthians?to which Catul? lus' loyal comites will follow him; it makes of its passage a spatial and generational extension of Catullus' nucleus of imperialistic encomium (11.10, Caesaris visens monimenta magni).64 Poem 11 is Catullus' bit? ter farewell to his mistress; is it worthwhile to contrast Antony's pursuit of Cleopatra's fleeing flagship to Alexandria after Actium? That, of course, is the defeat that the Nile is anticipating here; when the river next appears in the poem he will be opening his bosom to receive Antony and Cleopatra, in a passage (8.711-13) whose pathos and dig- nity contrast with the demonic portrait of Cleopatra in the lines that precede.65 There is something disingenuous about Aeneid 12.458?the way Virgil names these two astonishing warriors, only to enclose them within a conventional battle scene involving well-known figures or at 62Eur. Her. 375-79; cf. Norden 1957 on Aen. 6.802. 63The mountain was located in various parts of the East; see Austin 1977, 247. Servius (ad loc.) puts it in India. ^The epithet magni assimilates Julius Caesar to his own rival, Pompey, as heir to Alexander. Putnam (1974, 72-73) finds that the geographical sweep of Catullus' first stan- zas resonates in Aen. 6.789-800, as weil as in the similarly prophetic scene at 8.724-800. 65It may not be irrelevant that the Nile's third and last appearance in the Aeneid, at 9.31, is in a simile that compares Turnus and his Rutulians to the Nile and the Ganges: somewhat as in 12.458, Rutulians are assimilated to the East, particularly to the rivers of two Eastern lands to which Augustan ambitions claimed title (remember Osiris' identity as the Nile).</page><page sequence="17">THE DEATH OF OSIRIS IN AENEID 12.458 415 least unremarkable Trojans and Italians. The semantic richness of Thymbraeus and Osiris sets them apart from the rest and leads us far beyond their one line. That they introduce the combat means that syn- ecdochically they draw large themes from the poem into their pas? sage, and in particular remind us of the significance of this last battle for Aeneas' mission and for the future of Rome. Comparison should be made to a similar passage in the poem, 10.747-54, a catalogue of Italians and their Trojan victims in the midst of Mezentius' aristeia. Here all the warriors are hapax legomenoi with the exception of Messapus. The list begins Caedicus Alcathoum obtruncat. ... The name of Caedicus, with its heavy hint of caedes, sets the tone. Alcathous is like Thymbraeus in that he reprises an Iliadic warrior?the husband of Aeneas' sister Hip- podameia, in fact?whose death at the hands of Idomeneus occupies a notable section of Iliad 13. Unlike Thymbraeus, Aeneas' brother-in- law misses his second chance: his namesake falls as a foretaste of the general Trojan defeat. Perhaps 12.458 serves to correct the reading of the Iliad implicit in 10.747: in the end, the Italian war is not just a repe? tition of the Trojan War; in the end the Trojans do triumph.66 Moreover, unlike 10.747 the triumph in 12.458 is symbolic and reaches beyond its immediate situation: a moment in the final battle of the Rutulian war reprises in microcosm the whole war and prefigures the Battle of Ac- tium. Yet this line is no simpler than any such symbolic passage in the Aeneid. The names of Thymbraeus and Osiris are so peculiarly capa- cious, so alive to so many themes that have been evolving throughout the length of the epic, that each cannot help but encompass conflicting meanings and respond to the other in a unstable opposition of terms. The fight between these two warriors endlessly draws and redraws the lines between identity and alterity, pinpointing the epic's struggle to de- fine what it is to be Roman.67 Cornell University e-mail: jdr25@cornell.edu 66 One might compare the allusive movement by which Turnus-Achilles and Aeneas-Hector switch roles. Cf. Quint 1989 on the Trojans' strategy, in the second half of the poem, of repeating the past so as to reverse its defeats. 67I thank James J.
