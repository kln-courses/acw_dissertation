      <p>Here are “just the facts,” to paraphrase Jack Webb in Dragnet. The book contains 22 figures (some drawn by the author), 16 color plates, 210 endnotes, and 9 pages of references to scholarly works. There are 260 pages describing the travels and field work of Martin Brasier, an Oxford professor of paleobiology, in many exotic and off-the-beaten-path locations. The text examines “Darwin's dilemma,” the lost history of the origin of animal life in the Precambrian time.</p>
      <p>To go beyond the facts: this is a highly specialized book that may not appeal to many high school and general biology instructors at the two- or even the four-year college level, because its utility in their classrooms is questionable. The author recognizes this, perhaps unintentionally, when he writes on page 165 (referring to paleontologists who dare to enter Darwin's “lost world”): “Most of them suffered too, to be swallowed up by ridicule or, even worse, by obscurity.” The book's readability suffers from frequent name-dropping. For example, in one 20-page stretch, Brasier mentions 25 names of scientists, former students, and others, some of significant reputation that would be recognized, but most not. I found this distracting.</p>
      <p>Also distracting was the constant use of hundreds of unpronounceable scientific names (e.g., Chancolloria, Okulithcyanthus, and Kotuycanthus). Page 134 has seven such references. Trite and forced metaphors and similes abound. One metaphor takes up the equivalent of a full page. Another reads, “Sponges consist of colonies of cells that are strangely casual in their connectedness and they appear largely disinterested in body symmetry.” Did you detect the anthropomorphism? Or a section in chapter three, headed “Worms in Drag,” where he also describes a fossil as looking like “a novelty condom.” Another section is called “The Circus of Performing Worms.”</p>
      <p>The last few chapters finally get to the discovery of microfossils in the phosphate-laden beds of the northwestern Highlands of Scotland. Plates 14 and 15 show what appear to be intact preserved cellular material of Precambrian origin. Brasier acknowledges that these fossils may or may not be what they appear to be. He describes a trap that he calls “Mofaotyof,” which means: my oldest fossils are older than your oldest fossils.</p>
      <p>These plates (14 and 15) do capture the imagination when envisioning what the origin of animal life in Precambrian time may have looked like. It must be pointed out that Brasier's explanation for why there are so few Precambrian fossils that might fill in the gaps of the fossil record is both compelling and well explained.</p>
      <p>I am neither a paleobiologist nor an Oxford professor, and this review may be too harsh. But enter Darwin's Lost World at your own risk.</p>
