EARTHY CREATURES By Michael Atkinson A QUIVERING BUBBLE SKIN'S breadth away from the millennium, it's no won- der we're doped up on the torque of a life with movies: no other human crea- tion ever has let us step through a win- dow into the rag-and-bone-shop of others' hearts, has allowed us to see ancient Rome or Satan or a man shake hands with himself or change into a wolf and back again, has altered the govern- ment of our dreams and the manner by which we view the passage of our own lives. Perhaps most of all, movies are sensory dynamos, hurricanes of com- pressed experience. Whatever chaos there is in life there is in movies tenfold; the simplest, stupidest action movie can become sublime through the choreogra- phy of extraordinary mayhem, and any argument against it is an argument against cinema. Formally, movies can make our perspectives their warped own in the passing of a frame, make non- sense of body tissue, space, and time, use visual momentum itself as a bludg- eon. Sometimes we are made to feel we're choking on our own hearts, frozen on the dark brink of complete bedlam. It's that taste of burnt nerves and raw pleasure that is one of movies' primal selves. It's an excessive mind state, one predicated on vertiginous risk and the queasy comedy of catastrophe, and Peter Jackson has made it his own. Just as Busby Berkeley trucked in the Uto- pian geometries of success and love, Jackson contemplates in a similarly absurd fashion the texture of disaster, 31</page><page sequence="2">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="3">Jackson (I) with cinematographer Alun Bollinger on HEAVENLY CREATURES. albeit on a personal level that in Brain- dead exceeds and violates any notion of physical intimacy movies may still keep faith with. Hapless ruin, be it visualized as the gargantuan horror of Akira , the amusement-park thrill machines of 72, Speed , and True Lies , or the miniature mano-a-mano nightmares of Tetsuo , Evil Dead //, and Jackson's films, has a seductive charm that suckles the sadist in all of us. And this includes Heavenly Creatures , visually conceived as it is like a fever-dream, and constructed so inti- mately around the heroines' obsessions that we, too, begin to look forward to the liberation of bloodshed. Make no mistake, this is a time- honored sensibility: the "sick joke" midnight between farce and savagery can be traced (pace pop cult maven David J. Skal) to Jacobean death jokes like Cyril Tourneur's 1606 The Reveng- ers Tragedy. Of course, what makes Jackson stand alone in this killing field is hardly Braindeaď s passionate devo- tion to out-helter-skeltering the compe- tition; it's Heavenly Creatures , a masterpiece that simultaneously marks a quantum leap from the crude emo- tional syntax of zombie comedies, and expresses Jackson's topos even more eloquently. For Jackson's earlier films are freshmanic, take-no-prisoners taboo-busters, built for shock and speed, fueled by a very real and reckon- able will to power and punkish hunger to usurp authority. They make trouble like a smart, bitter 16-year-old anarchist dizzy with his/her new sense of misun- derstood self, of independence, of sub- version and fearlessness. They're films the girls of Heavenly Creatures , in another time and perhaps gender, might've made themselves. Jackson simply transferred his furious instinct for Dada thumb-nosing onto his Christ- church teenagers. In this way, and espe- cially regarding the matricidal imagery of Jackson's earlier work, Heavenly Creatures can be read as autobio, New Zealand punk style. JACKSON'S FIRST FILM, Bad Taste ('88), is a clumsy, cheap, and sometimes hilarious shotgun wedding between alien-takeover film and cannibal farce, notable for little beyond its intermittent Three Stooges riffs and seminal use of explosive birth/womb jokes. The type of movie that's often financed by the crew's frequent trips to the blood bank, Bad Taste was actually shot over three years, and looks it. Still, Jackson's consistent fondness for fish-eye compo- sitions, loopy landscapes, and biocom- bustibility is unmistakably present. It's apprentice work, and indicative of where a subversive spirit can lead you if you haven't developed the legerdemain and style necessary to speed the pro- fane imagery across the screen like bullets out of a hundred guns. From the first, Bad Taste quite apparently interfaced with the gory post-Stooge sensibility of Sam Raimi - Jackson's filthy blood-chuckles are the direct progeny of Raimi's first two Evil Dead movies, which simply carried the work of Herschell Gordon Lewis, Paul Morrissey, George Romero, and Frank Henenlotter to its logical extreme. What Raimi introduced to the sub-subgenre of body-assault comedy was a breath- less degree of formal dementia, often abandoning his stories altogether for giggly jags of jet-propelled visual fury. That, and his deep understanding of physical comedy - the outer limits of which are represented by, or course, Moe, Larry, Curly &amp; Co. - and its prox- imity to pain. (Note that all Raimi mov- ies, even The Quick and the Dead , have cast credits for one or more "Fake Shemps," homage to the decidedly un- Shemp-like dummies that often got hurled out windows in the aging Stooge's place.) Comparisons between Raimi and Jackson are unavoidable: coopting the protean charge and pace of Raimi's films while maintaining a partic- ularly NZ trashiness, Jackson had attempted to outgrue Raimi from the gitgo (consider Jackson Curly to Raimi's Moe, reacting in frantic fury to every eyepoke and brickbat), and after Brain- dead even Raimi has implicitly admitted that cannibal slapstick has seen its Intolerance. Their careers have counterpointed from the moment brain matter began falling comically out the back of one of Bad Taste's protagonist's skulls. Although Raimi is the pioneer and tech- nically the more polished moviemaker, Jackson has proven to be the more imaginative, and the least genre-con- stricted. Whereas Raimi ascended to the exhilarating comic-book hyperbole of Darkman (his best), Jackson tangoed into savage media parody with Meet the Feebles ('89), an enthusiastically blood- thirsty rip through the Muppets and showbiz fables in general. That there are no humans in the film doesn't pre- vent Jackson from studying the arc of viscera, vomit, and disease as it invades a preposterous TV fantasy world. "The Muppet Show" per se may be an easy target, and the subjection of puppets to the foulest of human inequi- ties a one-note joke born of a film majors' beer-flooded dorm caucus, but Jackson hits every comic note and never takes his foot off the insult-throttle. The various felt &amp; vinyl bottomfeeders inhabiting this particular theater of cru- elty include: a satyric rabbit dying slowly of a sex disease; a knife-throwing junkie frog given to 'Nam flashbacks (the cruelest and funniest persona); a big-boss walrus caught more than once screwing a cat on his desktop; a huge, drug-dealing wild boar; an elephant saddled by a chicken with a paternity suit (he insists the child isn't his, but it is half chicken, half elephant); a toilet- loitering fly reporter who patrols the theater for scandal; a rat who shoots s&amp;m porn loops in the sewers with an udder-ringed cow and a cockroach; etc. Most of the madness is seen through the wide eyes of a Method-acting, lispy hedgehog new to the Feebles and caught perfectly between cuddly and mortified, especially once the obese and much-abused hippo starlet picks up 33</page><page sequence="4">poster- a ■ &lt;*350 finer films.

The pure excess of crude invention, devastating character assassination, and wicked visual vaudeville (the shivering frog's brutal POW nightmare, à la The Deer Hunter and complete with Viet- cong gophers arguing Marxism around the campfire, is breathtakingly ballsy) is formidable and exhausting, as is Jack- sons mise-en-scène, which makes hay out of the Muppets' below-the-belt nev- erland by emphasizing the Feebles' sex- ual and excretory activities. Indeed, it seems the paradox of hand-up-the-ass puppet architecture, from Mortimer Snerd to Svankmajer's Punch &amp; Judy to Alf, may have been what stimulated Jackson in the first place. Despite so much suffering (the AIDS-haunted rab- bit's final on-the-air vomit fit is the outer limit), the nasty anthropomorphism never graduates onto a sober Maus- like plateau, and good thing: excessive anti- authoritarian stances like Jackson's are always built on the most delicate and treacherous of aesthetic urges. Pussy- foot, and it collapses into a lie. As in a good bar brawl, if you wonder where the door is, you've already lost the fight. Jackson never lets us up for air, and so Meet the Feebles can seem relentless and unkind - an observation Jackson would have surely taken as a rave. His first three films carry an unmistakably Sadean attitude: we crave narrative bal- ance, and so triumphant disrespect for the vox populi is often best expressed as ceaseless, irrational battering. Sade, Jarry, Celine, Genet and Burroughs, the Dadaists, Surrealists, and Lettrists, acid rock, punk and rap: Jackson's lineage runs back to Bosch (especially in Brain- dead ), and through every college room, postered hideaway, and teen hangout in the land. FUCK ' EM , the secret culture howls at a world constructed of duty, safety, and sense, then laughs, hard, when normal people don't seem to understand why. INDEED, BRAINDEAD ('92) laughs louder at death than any movie ever has, and the titanic scope of dismemberment and butcher-shop slapstick pales all other attempts at blood humor, no matter the medium. It out-Raimis Raimi, and seems more human than Raimi's films besides - especially the more or less simultaneous Army of Darkness , the I slight, cartoony close to the Evil Dead trilogy. Truly, Braindead is the most hemophiliac of movies - once it begins geysering plasma, it just cant stop.* Still, this bloodshot bouillabaisse comes off as buoyant and invigorated with its own reckless nerve. Before the zombies attack the Norman Bates-ish hero's house en masse in a Spike Jones replay of Night of the Living Dead, we're treated to: the hero's zombie Mum obliviously eating her own detached ear and spitting out the earring; the same Mum rising from her grave just in time to bite a gang thug in the crotch (yes, while he's pissing on her grave); a kung- fu fighting priest slamming his foot right through undead torsos ("I kick ass for the Lord!"); two drugged zombies copu- lating and speedily generating a pure- bred zombie toddler, who descends on the local playground; and much more. In terms of textual chutzpah, it's like watching someone walk out onto the wing of an airplane. Once the climactic attack gets under- way, the walls are literally painted red with movie blood - and it's the movie- ness that's the crucial issue. Jackson is crazy in love with bad taste (watch out for the self-ambulating pile of intestines, complete with farting anus) and his élan compounds every frame. For anyone with eyes, the wit and ocular tumult of Braindead proved that Jackson had more than visions of exploding tissue in his heart - compare it to the equally ghoulish but insipid and lugubrious rot- fests of Jorg Buttgereit (Nekromantik et al.). Braindead is a delirious hoote- nanny celebrating the rush of movies themselves, their potential for realizing unimaginable imagery, their subversive spirit, their ability to bring breathless joy to the most harrowing and scatologi- cal material, their mad hubris and scorched-earth defiance. It's a wild- eyed party movie, and cinephiliacs everywhere are invited. Viewed this way, the Tasman Sea- sized leap to the comparatively restrained and sober Heavenly Crea- tures doesn't seem so huge, though it shouldn't for other reasons. For one thing, Heavenly Creatures is, objectively, hardly a restrained or sober work- indeed, its portrait of l'amour fou is brilliantly eccentric, passionate, and *Beware renting the cut, R-rated version on video.

For another, the rebel-yell autho- rial dynamics of Jackson's earlier mov- ies are sublimated as HC s heroines' warped and frustrated world-view; the amphetaminic escalade of rage and manic humor belongs to the girls, com- ing from the inside out, not so much to Jackson's film. The infamous 1954 New Zealand murder of Honora Parker by her daughter Pauline and Pauline's schoolmate Juliet Hulme (real-life mys- tery author Anne Perry as a youngster) must have been a magnet to Jackson's particular jones for psychosexual dam- age and mother horror. (Braindead cli- maxes with a hellish primal scene, as the hero's Mum transforms into a giant Moloch and swallows him up her uter- ine canal: cinema's most graphic epi- sode of vagina dentata.) Hulme and Parker are half-lost in the hermetic, mock-medieval world of their own gland-powered reveries, an extreme inti- macy - not unlike Jackson's fondness for the hidden interiors of body works- that's taken as overtly sexual by the girls' unlucky parents. Jackson clearly identifies with his misunderstood teen- agers, and what may have seemed sim- ply devilish japes in his previous films are used here to detail a deeply felt inner life. I am loath to shrug off Jackson's ear- lier films as merely vicious yock tan- trums, yet it must be admitted that gore comedy is not, in the end, a particularly challenging mode. Jackson knew he had run that jalopy right into a brick wall, which is where it belonged. So, in one lovely, graceful twist, he abandoned the company of Raimi, Henenlotter, et al. and expatriated to the country of ear- nest art films, style trumps, and Oscar nominations. (Raimi's contemporaneous genre defection, The Quick and the Dead , merely transfers the same Evil Dead heehaws to a static frontier farce.) Heavenly Creatures displays good taste no one had the right to expect from Jackson, but it still crackles with a try- anything overload of visual ideas. The girls' fantasyworld is filled with life- size clay figures, distant castles, uni- corns, and ordinary Christchurch landscapes that morph into flamboyant storybook gardens (the most creative use of morphing I've ever seen); adults are shot like matinee villains, but remain sympathetic; the camera's careening flights and suffocating close- ness to things evokes a swollen, pubertal anxiety the true story can only half- 36 The Thirty-second New York Film Festival Poster by William Copley is reproduced on museum quality paper and measures 261/2 X 38.

What may be more of a sur- prise is Jackson's handling of the actors, eliciting laurel-ready performances, in two tough roles, from nonvets Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet. Surprising, too, are the purple, righteous, painfully desperate entries from Pauline's real diary, read as narration. To imagine for a moment the naked, expressive anguish and ardor that Heavenly Crea- tures contains bursting from an Ameri- can movie is to glimpse an unknown, unrealized, and probably impossible Hollywood. As a treatment of a real murder case, Jackson's film is uniquely empathie and fleshy; set it against the crude short- comings of the (nevertheless fascinating) Leopold-Loeb threesome, Rope , Com- pulsion , and Swoon , and Jackson posi- tively glows with humanism. Heavenly Creatures is many things to many people -a docudrama on microdots, a hellza- poppin opening of old wounds and plumbing of mad love, a valentine to all of us run over by the ten thousand cruel stories of youth - but it's never less than a crazed and earnest testament to how movies can express emotions by the cre- ation, and manipulation, of vision. As per Hitchcock's attestation of what makes great cinema, we would still know exactly what Heavenly Creatures is about, textually and viscerally, even if the soundtrack were dropped out. Jack- son may be the man to definitively film Madame Bovary , The Castle , DeLillo's Liòra, even - dare we fantasize - J.G. Ballard's Crash. That he can so adroitly use hot-diggity horror movie conven- tions to drench us so effortlessly in the sweaty madness of adolescent angst and matricide is an ordinary miracle not only for the filmmaker but of the medium itself. After a century, we may take cinema a bit for granted. In our placid thrall to a star's sexual aura or our routine expectation of plot zigzags, we may fail to fully grok the rare and momentous journey we're on, where a minute alteration of the focal plane can reveal a human truth, and where a cam- era swirling over the heads of school- girls can speak to us of their giddy hungers and precarious grip on reality. We live with this second language every day, and are encouraged to think of it as "information." Jackson's right: we should think of it instead as rapture, as sorrow, as flight. ® Michael Atkinson is a regular contńbutor.
