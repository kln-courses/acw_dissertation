<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOHN J. McDERMOTT THE AMERICAN ANGLE OF VISION—II When a way of thinking is deeply rooted in the soil and embodies the instincts or even the characteristic errors of a people, it has a value quite independent of its truth; it constitutes a phase of human life and can powerfully affect the intellectual drama in which it figures.1 I η the case of America, to which Santayana's text primarily refers, the stakes are somewhat higher than that of an intellectual drama. For better or worse, the American perspective is engaged with other major cultures in formulating the dominant metaphors for world cul ture.2 As with all massive cultural formulations, we find in America the perils and fruits of original attitudes not institutionalized elsewhere. Having already sketched some of the historical and methodological factors pertinent to the analysis of American culture,3 we turn now to the major philosophical assumptions and implications of this tradi tion. Naturally, there can be no exhaustive treatment here of any of these issues; we wish rather to emphasize the confusion that frequently exists between the analysis of American philosophy and the philosophi cal analysis of American culture. Categories and persuasions often taken to be characteristic of the former, are actually found to be broadly based attitudes of the culture at large. During the classical phase of American philosophy, as well as in the subsequent work of Dewey, the culture and its philosophical tradition shared basic concerns and methods of articulation. The studied neglect of the American philosophical tradition by all but a handful of con temporary American thinkers cuts us off, then, not simply from a phi losophical option, but from the articulation of basic culture categories. Philosophy in America has made tremendous strides in a professional and technical way; but with rare exceptions, it has failed to address itself to the exigencies of the culture in a language commensurate with This is the conclusion of a two-part study; the first section appeared in our Spring issue.

A major reason for this is the increased sophistication of philosophical discourse, which renders the work of Edwards, Emerson, James and even Dewey inadequate and infelicitous in expression. What is not adequately realized, however, is the fact that these thinkers, among others, have their hands on a large set of basic, even primitive, reconstitutions of the way in which men structure inquiry, of the values they seek, and a fortiori of the role of philosophy. These concerns and their imaginative, though admittedly often vague versions, are indigenous to a culture which was attempting, within the ever present framework of Western European civilization, to work out what Emerson plaintively called "an original relation to the universe."4 While not always explicit, this theme is basic to American thinkers, at least until the first World War. In the long run, when one considers that it involves such questions as the meaning of nature, time, experi ence, and the experimental attitude, this cultural development should prove to be more important than the various responses given by indi vidual philosophers. Granted that we cannot nostalgically return to the alleged "Golden Age" of American philosophy, it remains that the questions which bound those thinkers to their culture are still with us, and as with all important questions, are badly in need of ever renewed philosophical analysis. The remarks which follow are an attempt to reopen some of these questions from the perspective of philosophy, always recalling their broader cultural significance. The Ambiguity of the Spiritual Pilgrimage In speaking of the American people during their formative years, Sidney Mead opens up the question that should increasingly occupy us now that we have obviously and irrevocably come to the end of any cultural and political separation from the pressing burdens of world culture. We are, in a word, faced anew with the problem of national identity. Their great and obvious achievement was the mastery of a vast, stubborn, and ofttimes brutal continent. This is the "epic of America," written with cosmic quill dipped in the blood, sweat, and tears of innumerable nameless little men and women and a few half-real, half-legendary heroes. . . . This is the mighty saga of the outward acts, told and retold until it has over-shadowed and suppressed the equally vital, but more somber, story of the inner experience. Americans have so presented to view and cele brated the external and material side of their pilgrims' progress that they have tended to conceal even from, themselves the inner, spiritual pilgrimage, with its more subtle dimensions and profound depths.5 The question at issue has to do with the qualities of this "inner 434 CROSS CURRENTS: FALL 1965</page><page sequence="3">experience." Are they distinctive enough to add dimension and insight to the human endeavor as understood from a wider cultural perspective? Many would answer in the negative, seeing America as primarily a derivative culture with its strengths in the area of applied wisdom, both political and technological. There is a long tradition of such criticism, which the following remark of Walter Rathenau accurately sums up: "America has no soul and will not deserve to have one until it consents to plunge into the abyss of human sin and suffering."6 On the other hand, a case can be made for the original and seminal aspects of what Mead calls the "spiritual pilgrimage," although the commentator must scrupulously avoid any chauvinism in his analysis. Speaking of our tendency to harbor a "cultural hypochondria," par ticularly among intellectuals, Daniel Boorstin states: The cure for our hypochondria is surely not chauvinism. That simply adds one real ill to the many unreal ills of which we already accuse ourselves. Waving a flag cannot cure inner uncertainty. One possibility, at least a little more fruitful, is to try to discover the peculiar virtues of our situation, the special character of our history: to try to judge ourselves by the potentialities of our own peculiar and magnificent continent. We may then discover that our virtues, like our ills, are actually peculiar to ourselves; that what seem to be inadequacies of our culture, if measured by European standards, are nothing but our differences and may even be virtues.7 This is also the intent of John Kouwenhoven's work on Made in America: The Arts in Modem Civilization. He writes in his "Preface" that it is a book about America which: . . . assumes that the elements of creative vitality in American civilization matter a great deal, not only to Americans but to other people as well. It was written in the conviction that we cannot understand either the limitations or the achievements of that civilization if we continue to think of it solely as the product of Western European culture, modified by the geography and the climate of the New World.8 In the final analysis, a continual reassessing of the significance of any .ultural lineage is actually a function of a more broadly based human endeavor. And it is not so much a question as to whether the American tradition is radically different from other cultures but whether in its emphases, concerns and blindspots, as generated by its historical situa tion, such a tradition doesn't offer options of a profound kind for the immediate human future. But the great obstacle to the articulation of such "inner qualities," at least in the American context, is that they do not lend themselves to any consistent ideological formulation. At times, this is a sign of great cultural insight; a living dialectic between a series of equally humanizing alternatives. Witness, for example, this JOHN J. McDERMOTT 435</page><page sequence="4">perceptive commentary on the twofold reaction of the American people to Lindbergh's flight: One view had it that America represented a brief escape from the course of history, an emergence into a new and open world, with the self-sufficient individual at its center. The other said that America represented a stage in historical evolution and that its fulfillment lay in the development of society. For one, the meaning of America lay in the past; for the other, in the future. For one, the American ideal was an escape from institutions, from the forms of society, and from limitations put upon the free individual; for the other, the American ideal was the elaboration of the com plex institutions which made modern society possible, an accept ance of the discipline of the machine and the achievement of the individual within a context of which he was only a part. The two views were contradictory but both were possible and both were present in the public's reaction to Lindbergh's flight.9 At other times, however, the articulation of our experiences remains trapped in a layer of self-deception that has often shrouded the way in which we understand and value ourselves. And this becomes a par ticularly crucial problem as our society relies increasingly on the activi ties of mass media for the development of self-understanding. In an incisive and exacerbating treatment of contemporary American culture, Daniel Boorstin shows how the externalized "image" of our experience has replaced the driving "ideal" that once motivated us. Of all nations in the world, the United States was built in nobody's image. It was the land of the unexpected, of unbounded hope, of ideals, of quest for an unknown perfection. It is all the more unfitting that we should offer ourselves in images. And all the more fitting that the images which we make wittingly or un wittingly to sell America to the world should come back to haunt and curse us. Perhaps, instead of announcing ourselves by our shadows and our idols, we would do better to share with others the quest which has been America.10 Can we offer another and more sanguine interpretation of the Ameri can penchant for mirroring itself in what often becomes a series of fake versions of deeply felt needs and ambitions? Perhaps this imaging of which Boorstin speaks is actually a degenerate form of a persistent symbolizing activity, an activity so necessary for a culture whose bounds are set out of events, often arbitrary, rather than as a response to deeply ingrained traditional mores.11 Recalling the historical dimensions of the origin of America, particularly the influence on it of the origin of modernity and the end of the fully intelligible universe, we must realize that the correlative upheaval in western values could manifest itself in a series of ways. In effect, given the American context, an underlying doctrine of an open nature and an anthropomorphic view of historical destiny can generate either a bold, ongoing symbolization of man's 436 CROSS CURRENTS: FALL 1965</page><page sequence="5">humanizing his environment, or a self-deceiving, pollyanna version of the world in which the major dimensions of human life are lived vicariously. American culture is, of course, shot through with these alternative formulations and it is not adequately realized that they both proceed from the same originating qualities and concerns, intrinsic to its his torical development. Those who oppose the tawdry and seductive dimen sions of contemporary American culture by appealing to a nostalgic view of morally integral old America, should be aware—as was Melville in his Confidence Man12—that the very trust in experience, so indelibly and fruitfully American, was also the gateway to sham, corruption and the ultimate dissolution of the very fabric of truth in human affairs. Boorstin's Image, or What Happened to the American Dream, can be read as a modern version of Melville's critique, and although not as philosophically incisive, it is ultimately more terrifying, for it draws on the wiles of the revolution in mass media, engendered by modern technology. In order to come to grips with this basic ambiguity that surrounds the fundamental categories of self-understanding in American life, we have to analyze the assumptions about "knowing," which are actually the decisive factors in the framing of our fundamental value systems. In contemporary terms, we must begin to utilize the perspective of a "culture-epistemology." It is true that, taken in its widest ramifications, this problem yields only to a thorough cultural history, but from the single perspective of philosophy, several critical dimensions are opened up. First, the emergence of an attitude toward knowledge, which results from the concrete historical situation and its entwining of a primitive environment with reflective and religiously wise settlers. This "reflective primitivism" ultimately forges a new doctrine of the relationship between nature and experience. Secondly, in the cultural and historical develop ment of this novel setting, there is manifested a basic rephrasing of the fundamental relationship between thought and experience. To focus on these concerns is to come to grips with one major strand of those "inner qualities" central to American life; a strand which, when im properly assessed, leads to much that is shallow and dehumanizing on the American scene. Reflective Primitivism: The Experience of Experience In the American seventeenth century, philosophy was all but non existent; yet reflection was intense and self-conscious, primarily as a response to a pressing and omnipresent collective experience of a situa tion that was novel at every turn. And although that period in American history offered no articulation of the notion of experience as such, there was a correspondingly rich awareness of the significance of this situa JOHN J. McDERMOTT 437</page><page sequence="6">tion over against the tradition of reflection. It was a period that dealt with profound philosophical themes without an articulated philosophi cal language. In effect, the American seventeenth century realized a broadly based cultural experience of experience. Santayna saw this clearly when he stated that "The country was new, but the race was tired, chastened and full of solemn memories."13 And in a different context, Dewey offers this revealing comparison: In a certain sense the motif of American colonial history and of Defoe's Robinson Crusoe are the same. Both represent man who has achieved civilization, who has attained a certain maturity of thought, who has developed ideals and means of action, but is suddenly thrown back upon his own resources, having to cope with a raw and often hostile nature, and to regain success by sheer intelligence, energy and persistence of character.14 The most obvious and persistent imports of this dialectic between the reflective tradition, as carried by the settlers, and the "new world" was the dominance of the "experience" over any conceptual anticipation of "how things should be." The original situation had a clarity to it. For summer being done, all things stand upon them with a wetherbeaten face; and the whole countrie, full of woods &amp; thickets, represented a wild &amp; savage heiw. If they looked behind them, ther was the mighty ocean which they had passed, and was now as a maine barr &amp; goulfe to separate them from all the civill parts of the world.15 Theory broke down here and "what one could build on this continent tended to become the criterion of what one ought to build here."16 A factor in this development may very well have been the inability of colonial Americans to initially duplicate the English version of cul tural proprieties. Thus "the American, 'this new man,' was early con ceived in relation to civilized Europe, if not to the savage frontier, as a primitive."17 This change in the spectrum of possibilities is engagingly caught in this excerpt from the Autobiography of Sam Houston: And yet, this running wild among the Indians, sleeping on the ground, chasing wild game, living in the forests, and reading Homer's Iliad . . . seemed a pretty strange business, and people used to say that I would either be a great Indian chief, or die in a mad-house, or be governor of the State—for it was very certain that some dreadful thing would overtake me I18 The cultural rejection by Europe fostered a sense of inferiority, but at the same time encouraged the colonial man to justify the richness of his own situation, making him open to new resources and ultimately to a different way of evaluating his needs and hopes. In this vein, Sanford states: The chosen people of the American colonies increasingly looked upon their mission into the wilderness not merely as the continua 43· CROSS CURRENTS: FALL 1965</page><page sequence="7">tion of something old, but as the beginning of something new: they were to usher in the final stage of history. They had inherited a new world in a physical sense, and in order 'to vindicate the most rigorous ideal of the Reformation' they felt it necessary in Jona than Edwards' words, 'to begin a new world in a spiritual respect.'19 The literature of early America—John Smith, the Puritans, and sub sequent commentaries on the continuing waves of settlement of 'free land'—attests to this re-formation and ultimately re-formulation of basic value structures under the press of a new setting. The realization of this new setting was the dominant theme of the second-generation Puritans, of whom Perry Miller said: "Having failed to rivet the eyes of the world upon their city on a hill, they were left alone with America."20 The stage was set for a long series of interactions between theoretical structures and a primitive but malleable environment. Nowhere is the epistemological implication of this persistently renewed interaction between reflection and environment more cogently phrased than in this passage from the Virginia Convention of 1830. A spokesman from Western Virginia states: But, sir, it is not the increase of population in the West which this gentleman ought to fear. It is the energy which the mountain breeze and western habits import to those emigrants. They are regenerated, politically I mean, sir. They soon become working politicians; and the difference, sir, between a talking and a working politician is immense. The Old Dominion has long been celebrated for producing great orators; the ablest metaphysicians in policy; men that can split hairs in all abstruse questions of political economy. But at home, or when they return from Congress, they have negroes to fan them asleep. But a Pennsylvania, a New York, an Ohio, or a western Virginia statesman, though far inferior in logic, metaphysics, and rhetoric to an old Virginia statesman, has this advantage, that when he returns home he takes off his coat and takes hold of the plow. This gives him bone and muscle, sir, and preserves his republican principles pure and uncontami nated.21 It is not necessary to adopt Frederick Jackson Turner's often too op timistic view of the results of this exposure to the primitive situation. Rather, the persistent tension between ideas and experience should be the focal point, a tension that led Henry Nash Smith to write of "Daniel Boone: Empire Builder or Philosopher of Primitivism?"22 This is the tension which is so clearly caught by Arthur K. Moore, in his book on Kentucky: Thus, the real frontiersman, obsessed with the garden myth and behaving accordingly, became entangled in several versions of the same myth projected into the wilderness by the romantic imagination. Existing both as abstractions derived from European ideas about nature and man and as objective realities embodying the practical consequences of those ideas, Kentucky and the Ken JOHN J. McDERMOTT 439</page><page sequence="8">tuckian may be said to have mediated between Western civilization and the civilization which evolved in the American West.23 What is crucial here, from the philosophical side, is that the press of environment as a decisive formulator of thought about the basic structures of the world became the outstanding characteristic of the American temperament. Pragmatism, so often regarded as the typically American philosophical product, is but a pale reflection of an ingrained attitude affirming the supremacy of experience over thought. It should be emphasized that this sense of the ineptness of anticipatory and de fining concepts for managing experience was not only paramount in the early colonial period but was characteristic of the growth of American culture until the end of the nineteenth century. This is true not only for those who lived at the level of popular culture but also for those whose responsibility involved an articulation of general responses to the life-situation. The tension between beliefs held and experiences generated by incessantly novel circumstances, often of a physical kind, is a central theme in the thought of John Winthrop, Jonathan Edwards, Horace Bushnell, Emerson, Whitman, and, of course, James and Dewey, to say nothing of the major lines of political literature. For the most part, that tradition of American thought which we now regard as seminal and even patriarchal, clearly sides with experience over reflection as the primary resource in formulating beliefs. Contemporary America, however, has grave doubts about the present viability of this tradition, seeing it as no longer adequate to the complex ideational demands that confront us on every level. There is certainly a legitimate aspect to this contention, particularly if the meaning of experience remains fixed in the romantic metaphors of an earlier American version, or in the unimaginative formulations of British empiricism. But a careful analysis of the history of the notion of experi ence in American thought would show previous instances where outworn and sterile terminology was successfully reconstituted. In a very real sense each generation is faced with using the method of experience to develop a language that is consonant with the events and potentialities of its own situation.24 Such a transformation of the meaning of experience was accomplished by American philosophy at the end of the nineteenth century.25 Not only did this tradition, begin ning with Chauncey Wright, effect a total reworking of the properly philosophical meaning of experience, but it also provided a large set of metaphors, capable of being utilized at the level of popular culture. Some of these, as for example Dewey's suggestions about education, have been worked into the fabric of American life. But others, like James's views on the "Moral Equivalent of War" and Dewey's "Common Faith," have only now been put to the test of relevance. Still others, such as Royce's doctrine of community and James's insight into indi 440 CROSS CURRENTS: FALL 196S</page><page sequence="9">vidual energies within a fully cosmic scheme, can still serve in the future reconstitution of experience along lines consistent with the still active assumptions of the culture. The point at issue is that the reflective primitivism so deeply imbedded within the culture is primarily an attitude, which more than in any other version of Western culture forces theoretical statements to respond more to the language of events than to its own mode of discourse. What must not be forgotten is the primal fact that the American tradition of which we speak, due to its aversion to any separate mode of discourse, cannot be adequately confronted simply by an epistemological critique of its shortcomings. Historically considered, this tradition was faced with an ever-shifting scene, characterized by widespread geographical, poli tical and spiritual upheavals. These crises were built into the very continuity of the culture, and it was thereby fitting that basic and even primitive categories of understanding were transformed. The meaning of the reflective experience is to point precisely to the fact that such a transformation had its basis in the willingness of the culture, over a sustained period of time, to listen to the informing character of experience. This was a culture which knew what learning meant and, significantly, was heir to a great tradition of learning. But it was also able to accept the press of experience without submitting such an interaction to a conceptual framework. Such an openness to experience has been well documented in terms of the development of our political institutions, but it has not been adequately understood as a broader doctrine of inquiry. Efforts in this latter direction have too often separated the concern for experience from the reflective attitude, thereby failing to realize that in the American context reflection is not necessarily the bearer of traditional intellectual values. What is needed is an under standing of the tremendous effort within American culture to relocate the role of learning, and even to provide for a different method of generating basic principles—both seen as a function of the method of experience. In our immediate cultural situation, we would have to admit that speculation which is not linked to this persistent dialectic of reflection and experience does not obtain an adequate hearing, but the charge of anti-intellectualism against the culture is simply not to the point. It might be said that the originality and power of the early formu lation of American culture was inseparable from the mobility resulting from its almost continental status and from the ever-present contiguous "free land." Since such a situation no longer holds true, perhaps it would be wise to abandon the attitudes developed in that situation and make a fresh start. But any attempt to redirect American culture has to confront several deeply rooted metaphysical beliefs that are not JOHN J. McDERMOTT 441</page><page sequence="10">easily gainsaid by traditional philosophical or theological terms. Further more, with events of staggering human importance manifesting them selves with unprecendented speed on the contemporary scene, in a world shrunken to geo-political intimacy, there is neither time nor space to bring off a total, yet continuous, reconstitution of our entire lineage. Seemingly aware that we cannot effect such a momentous realignment of our tradition, and yet obviously dissatisfied with what seems to be an increasingly shallow way of responding to the larger questions of our time, we may very well be wise to prescind from tra ditional canons of interpretation and take a fresh look at what we articulate only vaguely but actually hold to be our basic beliefs. A primary example might be our understanding of nature, seen pre eminently as space and as subject to man's fabrication. A second could be our understanding of time, seen as option, rather than as the measure of man's entropie situation. Both perspectives, although rooted in the early American experience, can claim powerful and direct relevance to the situation in which we now find ourselves. Reflective Primitivism: Nature and Time The influence of the land is sometimes looked upon as signifi cant only in primitive conditions of life. With the coming of "civilization," that is to say, trade and manufacture and organized cities, the land is supposed to diminish in importance. As a matter of fact, the importance of the land increases with civilization: "Nature" as a system of interests and activities is one of the chief creations of the civilized man.26 The literature pertaining to the meaning of nature as an American motif is extensive.27 It often involves an analysis of the relationship between the experience in America and the corresponding myth of the Garden or the quest for Eden. Following Sanford, this relationship includes the activities of both the "philosophers of primitivism" and the "trailblazers of progress": The Edenic image as I have defined it, is neither a static agrarian image of cultivated nature nor an opposing image of the wilderness, but an imaginative complex which, while including both images, places them in a dynamic relationship with other values. Like true myth or story, it functions on many levels simultaneously, dramatizing a people's collective experience within a framework of polar opposites. The Edenic myth, it seems to me, has been the most powerful and organizing force in American culture.28 A much less adequately analyzed notion is that of time. Of particular concern is the separation of the analysis of time from that of nature, as though honoring a dualism between the inner and outer man.29 Sidney Mead, for example, in a penetrating essay on the role of space in the 442 CROSS CURRENTS: FALL 1965</page><page sequence="11">development of the American people, asserts that "Americans have never had time to spare. What they did have during all their formative years was space—organic, pragmatic space—the space of action. And perhaps this made the real difference in the formation of 'this new man.' "30 The "space of action," however, should be seen as funda mentally a "time" category, for it structures possibility, and gives to the immediate situation a quality of human participation that renders meaningful the temporal process. Space is not a sufficiently humanizing context for man's situation. When events are framed against novel occurrences, the experience of ordinary living takes on the hue of an imaginative reconstruction of life. James has told us "that according to my view, experience as a whole is a process in time . . ."S1 But if the setting for this process, relative to each life lived, is characterized by repetition and by the plodding dullness of a context that rarely, if ever, is broken into by basic shifts in direction, then the "process" may be aeonically viable but of little import in immediate terms. Tillich sees this clearly. He holds that "while time and space are bound to each other in such an inescapable way, they stand in a tension with each other which may be considered as the most fundamental tension of existence."32 But this tension is not one of a simple standoff, for it can be recast from the side of the human endeavor. In man the final victory of time is possible. Man is able to act towards something beyond his death. He is able to have history, and he is able to transcend even the tragic death of families and nations, thus breaking through the circle of repetition towards something new. Because he is able to do so, he represents the potential victory of time, but not always the actual victory.33 We would argue that this statement of Tillich is a precise description, writ small, of the historical American interaction between institutional possibilities and the setting of nature. Tillich, himself, after his Ameri can experience, seemed to arrive at the same viewpoint. But in spite of these permanent contacts with the Old World, the New World grasped me with its irresistible power of assimilation and creative courage ... I saw the American courage to go ahead, to try to risk failures, to begin again after defeat, to lead an experi mental life both in knowledge and in action, to be opened toward the future, to participate in the creative process of nature and history.34 Nature, as understood within the American tradition, was open and seminal for human life. This is not to say that nature, so understood, was simply and necessarily beneficent. It is to say, however, that the simple fact of prodigal space yielded a sense of fecundity, possibility, and, above all, the challenge that was to be associated with man as "engaged" with nature. This fundamental attitude is phrased by the American JOHN J. McDERMOTT 443</page><page sequence="12">explorer, John Wesley Powell, in an address in 1883 on the "Methods of Evolution." When a man loses faith in himself, and worships nature, and subjects himself to the government of the laws of physical nature, he lapses into stagnation, where mental and moral miasma is bred. All that makes man superior to the beast is the result of his own endeavor to secure happiness . . . Man lives in the desert by guid ing a river and fertilizing the sands with its waters, and the desert is covered with fields and gardens and homes."35 Not only did this tradition deny that conforming to nature was the highest wisdom, it even awarded ultimate authority to the needs, ad mittedly often ostensible, of human activity. John Anderson speaks of eighteenth-century American thought as offering us "an original insight" into the relationship between man's nature and the order of nature. Thus American thinkers including John Adams and Thomas Jefferson made explicit the focus of men's attention upon the New World by describing the individual in the setting of the order of nature; and, in Jefferson's case at least, contributing an original interpretation of the moral problem of man's free natural action by describing the New World as the matrix required for the emergence of man's moral nature.3® This anthropocentric approach to nature yields in turn a deep-seated paradox, still active in the American temperament. On the one side, the Edenic myth of the "garden," while on the other, a systematic destruction of natural resources under the press of an aggressive and collective adolescence in which liberation from feudal and antique political patterns generated a hostility to any structure, even the rhythm of the forests. Negative also was the cultural worship of youth, the ab sence of a De Senectute, and the refusal to recognize the price to be paid for squandering resources and doing often irreparable damage to the fabric of nature on which subsequent generations depended. In com menting on this situation Anderson says, "Consider as one typical ex ample the development of the Great Plains in the late 19th century. Here the effort to conquer the land was successful when reinforced by the Industrial Revolution; and the ultimate social effects were realized in the Dust Bowl of the 20th century."37 Charles Sanford states the cul tural significance of this relationship between unlimited possibility and the accent on youth. The newness of the country, the expectation of some kind of rebirth or beatitude in the near future, and the eternal promise of future blessings associated with the land produced a distinct emphasis on youth in America ... A psychic primitivism of youth replaced or accompanied geographical and cultural primitivism . . . The cult of newness followed the pioneers westward; it fortified bumptious individualism in its never-ending contests with author ity; it contributed to a characteristically American disrespect for 444 CROSS CURRENTS: FALL 1965</page><page sequence="13">tradition and history; it minimized fatally the large contribution which European civilization has made to our culture; it served as an important basis for criticism of the "new" industrial order and supplied the moral and intellectual framework within which it was to operate. Finally, it continued to haunt the American mind long after, conceivably, it should have reached maturity.38 There is considerable truth in these remarks. We should not forget, however, that the cult of youth is a reflection of a more important and far-reaching dimension of the American doctrine of nature. The emphasis on the immediate, on the good of this generation, and the absence of concern for the larger future is a symptom of a specific doctrine of "local time." The significance of man, in this view, proceeds from his immediate situation rather than from his place in any meta historical scheme. We could describe this as an American stoicism, wherein human life is inextricable from its relationship with nature, but yet free to formulate the character of this relationship, with increas ing control, from the human side. This dialectic is expressed in an incisive text by John Anderson: Thus both Emerson and Thoreau accepted the insight of their time, that man's nature was that of a shaper, a constructor and maintainer. But they focused attention upon man's autonomous nature, his intrinsic self; they insisted that each man saw himself not only as a part of the creative flow of experience but as a universal reference point in this flow. Viewed in this way, man was seen not as identical with the evolution of a novel strand in experience, but as a jewel which might reflect an inclusive and eternal meaning. Asked who he was, man could then reply, I am this universal spark. And with this statement he could main tain in principle his integrity in the course of his creative action wherever in particular this might lead him.39 In such a view, man has a future, but its prognosis should never be uprooted from the actual situation in which he finds himself. The future is to be realized generation by generation and its goals constantly reworked in the light of man's needs and capacities. "Experience had taught Americans," Bryce reported "that though the ascent of man may be slow it is also sure."40 How "sure" it is remains open to serious question. But it may be generalized, that the American tradition can be understood as the first post-historical41 and communal rejection of an eschatological framework, which yet retains an aggressive doctrine of the meaning of history. Granted that there often is a shallow side to thinking simply in terms of generation to generation; nonetheless, such an attitude avoids the type of absolutist ideology, whether in the name of religious, metaphysical or Utopian political beliefs, that so often yields an oppressive immediate social order so as to guarantee some future way of life. The American view is that nature is pliant and at the service of the JOHN J. McDERMOTT 445</page><page sequence="14">community of men who, although mindful of the past, are committed to build a city out of response to contemporary needs. There is irony here, since this view, often described as short-sighted and even "materialistic," is actually an embodiment of what is now the "sophisticated" interpre tation of Christianity—namely, the emphasis on the sacramentality of time redeemed. It is difficult to see how one could structure a doctrine of the primacy of individual life, operative within a community of men devoted to human amelioration, if the over-all setting were not characterized by an openness of nature and an admission that the created world served the needs and vision of the human quest. Some have answered that such a view is too anthropomorphic and lacks patience with a beneficent God; but history has told us a different story, for such beneficence is all too obscure. This is especially so when one realizes that the notion of God is often inseparable from doctrines such as that of the cyclic nature of ancient man with its inexorable reduction of human life to an aeonic fragment,42 or with the later scholastic view of natural law, supposedly more reflective of man's actual nature, while really manifesting the sociological boundaries in which he was placed by in grained institutional power. It recurs finally in the modern world found in the inverted forms of varying ideologies, all offering a total resolution of man's plight if he would but conform to the latest sociological or poli tical myth. Analysis of such previous interpretations of man's fate shows them to be just as anthropomorphic as the doctrine of an open nature, with man as the giver of "forms."43 But there is this salutary difference: the admission of man's pre-eminence over nature, when joined to an acknowledged irresolution relative to the ultimate questions, makes possible the building of the principle of self-correction into our basic framework as a metaphysical category. At its most fruitful, this attitude is unfettered by prejudices or by a worship of the past. It finds its con crete expression in experiment as directed to an ever richer expression of human life and human institutions. This is the kind of America envisioned by Dewey. At its worst, it is characterized by an arrogant usurpation of natural processes, simply for the purpose of pandering to the narrowest range of human needs. This is the America so legitimately held up to ridicule by Boorstin and so often scorned by the American intellectual. In Tillich's view, America "can be both a world power politically and a provincial people spiritually. Will the emphasis on the 'American way of life' produce such a situation?"44 Repeating our opening analysis, the nub of the problem is that both cultural attitudes proceed basically from the same set of assumptions, generally understood. The doctrine of an open nature, romanticised as unfettered freedom and self-reliance, when assimilated without cog nizance of the major problems inseparable from such a view, supports only a superficial version of cultural life. On the other hand, when 446 CROSS CURRENTS: FALL 1965</page><page sequence="15">understood in its full significance and admitting to the burdens of holding to such a perspective, the American tradition can sustain an approach to cultural life as rich as the great versions of the past. If experience, nature, and time as historically undergone constitute the basic framework through which the qualities of the American tradition developed, the articulation of these categories constitutes still another aspect of this problem. The full implications of the historical events in American life, worked out within the broad perspective of a reflective primitivism, are not realized until one binds such develop ments to their subsequent articulation, particularly by philosophy. This is especially true of our leading metaphor, experience.45 The develop ment in American consciousness from the "experience of experience," to the "notion of experience" and finally with Dewey to the "method of experience," is of crucial importance from both the cultural and philosophical viewpoint. The question, of course, is whether the articu lation of these deeply felt cultural traditions maintains the richness and immediacy of the original responses. Secondly, if such an articulation does keep fidelity with the tradition, can it also show relevance to the more specifically intellectual dimensions of its own mode of discourse? In a word, can American philosophy do philosophy and yet remain within the traditional cultural dispositions of the American cultural past? It would seem that while doing other things, American philoso phy must do at least this much, if we are to avoid what Tillich fears—a future characterized by spiritual provincialism. The Articulation of Experience American philosophers, young and old, seem scratching where the wool is short.4® In a recent essay on "The Return to Experience," Robert Johann tries anew to open up the importance of a shift away from "reflective thought" to that of the method of experience as the distinctively per sonal activity of human life. He tells us that "any effort to locate the real in a realm distinct from everyday experience and somehow accessible only to thought will bypass the real altogether."47 Although the notion of experience has roots in Greek philosophy, and was a central concern for Kant as well as for Locke and Hume, it is clear that Johann places himself in the tradition of James and Dewey as another in a long line of commentators48 who attempt to break open this most obvious and yet most obscure of philosophical notions. James was right when he spoke of experience as a double-barrelled word, figuring as both thought and thing.49 And Dewey also, when he added: Like its congeners, life and history, it includes what men do and suffer, what they strive for, love, believe and endure, and also JOHN J. McDERMOTT 447</page><page sequence="16">how men act and are acted upon, the ways in which they do and suffer, desire and enjoy, see, believe, imagine—in short, processes of experiencing ... It is "double-barrelled" in that it recognizes in its primary integrity no division between act and material, subject and object, but contains them both in an unanalyzed totality. "Thing" and "thought," as James says in the same con nection, are single-barrelled; they refer to products discriminated by reflection out of primary experience.50 Now, whatever the difficulties in the tangled philosophical literature about experience, a constant theme emerges, warning us against the intellectualizing of our situation to the extent that we cut ourselves off from the richer and unfettered immediacies of living. But these warnings themselves often take on a highly speculative character and soon become shadows of the very intellectualism they oppose. A fas cinating parallel to this problem of "thinking about experience" is found in the brief history of postwar existentialism. In the effort to elucidate the full burden of living in tension between l'étranger and l'homme révolté, philosophy, omnivorous to the end, blanketed the problem with a host of distinctions and clarifications, worthy of analytic philosophy, but hardly of the thrust of the existentialist concern. So too with the method of experience: easy to claim as a touchstone but exceedingly difficult to abide by within the very fabric of inquiry. Johann warns of this difficulty when he states that "the proper role of reflection is not to construct an escape from experience, but by seeking to formulate the links and connections that experience presents to us, gradually to enrich our awareness of what it is we are about and what is at stake, so that life itself, in the light of this awareness, can be lived with greater meaning and purposefulness."81 Within the American context, the effort to remain faithful to the demands of experience has constantly been entangled with the assertion that the culture is fundamentally "anti-intellectual." Much has been written about this theme in American culture, and no doubt there are complex reasons for much of the antagonism shown the intellectual, particularly when one analyzes the political ramifications of class struc ture emanating from distinctions derived from education.52 In his comprehensive study of this problem, Hofstadter sees the roots of such an attitude in the primitive and evangelical dimensions of early America and its realization in the subsequent growth of the business mentality: If evangelicalism and primitivism helped to plant anti-intel lectualism at the roots of American consciousness, a business society assured that it would remain in the foreground of American think ing. Since the time of Tocqueville it has become a commonplace among students of America that business activism has provided an overwhelming counterpoise to reflection in this country. Toc queville saw that the life of constant action and decision which was entailed by the democratic and businesslike character of 448 CROSS CURRENTS: FALL 1965</page><page sequence="17">American life put a premium upon rough and ready habits of mind, quick decision, and the prompt seizure of opportunities— and that all this activity was not propitious for deliberation, elabo ration, or precision in thought.53 There is much to be said for this interpretation from the perspective of straight historical narrative, but its underlying philosophical assumption is open to question. Too often, the perspective from which evaluation is made accepts the classical distinction between the speculative and practical as permanent deposits in the activity of inquiry. In a general way, Hofstadter recognizes this and attempts to redress such abstract dualisms as "intellect and emotion," "intellect and practicality," by reworking the category of intellect. This approach is, however, an up hill struggle given the implicit philosophical framework of American culture. We should offer here a reworking from another perspective, namely, the refusal to accept any dualism at all, while yet trying to locate the life of reflection in terms of the wider context of experience. In this way, the history of those movements often thought to be anti intellectual, if given a different setting for analysis, can perhaps be shown to have made decisive contributions to the way in which men seek and ground knowing. It is not unimportant that in a general way, the American tradition involves a crucial shift in the method for ascertaining the major focus of inquiry. Because of the pre-eminence of the experience of nature as open and as subject to reconstruction, the prime analogates for inquiry have centered on life metaphors. From the very outset, the notions of growth, experiment and liberty, along with a host of derived metaphors, have characterized inquiry in American life. This holds not only for those endeavors traditionally directed to so-called practical concerns but equally constitutes the very fibre of religious thought. Indeed, more revealing, such metaphors comprise the major language of the American philosophical tradition, when it finally emerges in the nineteenth century. With Emerson and again with Dewey, we have a philosophical concern that uses the language of cultural cliché. In a word, the problematic assumes the primary role, reserved elsewhere for the ineffable, the Good, or the language of being. In such a worldview, the most profound recesses of reflection are themselves burdened by the obligation to reconstruct experience so as to aid in the resolution of those difficulties seen to hinder growth. In an address at Union College in 1836, Gulian Verplanck carefully analyzes this attitude: But it has often been objected that this all-absorbing gravitation towards the useful, the active, and the practical, in our country., propels every student from his most favorite studies into the struggles, the competition, and tumult of life, and is thus fatal at once to all recondite and curious learning, to deep attainment in pure science or polished excellence in elegant art and literature. JOHN J. McDERMOTT 449</page><page sequence="18">There is certainly some portion of truth in this objection, and yet but a portion only . . . The experience of scientific investigation has shown that such application of the test of reality and experiment to theoretic truth, has not only often thrown a clearer light on that theory, at once limiting its generalities and confirming its evidence, but has also evolved new combinations, suggested new inferences, and mani fested higher laws . . . Thus contemplations, apparently the most shadowy, have often operated with the greatest efficiency upon the most engrossing concerns of daily life.54 The passion for amelioration of the human plight, so carefully nurtured by the French philosophes, becomes almost a total cast of mind within the American tradition. Such a view is clearly put by Dewey, when he states that "Philosophy recovers itself when it ceases to be a device for dealing with the problems of philosophers and becomes a method, cultivated by philosophers, for dealing with the problems of men."55 Or again, with James, who tells us that "Knowledge about life is one thing; effective occupation of a place in life, with its dynamic currents passing through your being, is another."56 Thus American classical philosophy comprises a highly original effort to maintain a genuinely metaphysical concern within the limits of time and nature. Such an approach is most obviously characterized by the refusal to separate the efforts of intellectual life, including those of philosophy, from the burden of resolving concrete problems. Following James: "Ideals ought to aim at the transformation of reality—no less."54 This attempt at amelioration, which burdens the processes of thought, even those of so-called basic research, should not be seen as simply a pragmatic reductionism, directed to what James called the American "moral flabbiness born of the exclusive worship of the bitch-goddess Success."58 Rather than honoring a simple dualism between thought and action, the American bent toward the practical should be viewed from a wider perspective. Both the method of reflection and the method of action are to be seen as conjoined and rotating functionaries of an experimental approach. Neither method is self-contained or totally reliable but assumes priority relative to the nature of the problem to which it is directed. It is the problem and its resolution, or at least reconstruction on more enhancing terms, that occupies the place of importance in this approach to inquiry. The rotating priority of thought and action covers an important and infrequently analyzed assumption in American life; the contention that experience, as such, has informing, directive and self-regulating qualities which are ordered and managed as subject to intelligence and as responsible to the burdens of the various contexts in which inquiry finds itself. Thought and action are func tionaries of the method of experience in a culture which gives to experience qualities and powers usually denied in the larger tradition 450 CROSS CURRENTS: FALL 1965</page><page sequence="19">of Western thought. It is this underlying assumption as to the seminal character of the method of experience for both theory and practice that has to be isolated and reworked in the light of contemporary problems and language. Failure to do this results not only in our falling back into a crippling dualism between practical and speculative activity, on cultural lines, but also, as Dewey warns, denies us the riches of imme diate experience in favor of an ever more vacuous conceptual tradition: The serious matter is that philosophies have denied that common experience is capable of developing from within itself methods which will secure direction for itself and will create inherent stand ards of judgment and value. No one knows how many of the evils and deficiencies that are pointed to as reasons for flight from experience are themselves due to the disregard of experience shown by those peculiarly reflective. To waste of time and energy, to disillusionment with life that attends every deviation from concrete experience must be added the tragic failure to realize the value that intelligent search could reveal and mature among the things of ordinary experience.89 A brief commentary on this modern jeremiad by Dewey should put the question of the articulation of experience into some perspective. It is clear that Dewey, for one, accepts the assumption about the power of experience which is basic to American life. But he demands also an articulation of this assumption relative to the major problems faced by each generation and subject to the logical structures of the various methodological approaches as embodied in the disciplines of intellectual life.69 And his major concerns were with the notions of nature, growth and human interaction with institutional life, often phrased out in the vein sketched here as characteristic language of the American tempera ment. What Dewey laments is the separation of reflection from the method of experience. In a brilliant statement of the meaning of experi ence, "congenial to present conditions," Dewey contrasts his position with the "orthodox" view. The latter, in general terms, sees experience as blunt and always in need of conceptual formulation before performing any significant cognitive function. Dewey, on the contrary, sees experi ence as richly informing on its own terms, shot through, as it were, with implicitness and meaning.61 He offers that in his view "experience in its vital form is experimental" and has as its "salient trait," "connection with a future." For Dewey, experience is not antithetical to thought; he holds that there exists "no conscious experience without inference; reflection is native and constant."62 Upon more careful analysis Dewey's view would be seen as incomparably richer than other statements of experience. Dewey, however, has presented a view of experience deeply rooted in a cultural attitude, as against a philosophical statement of what has always been a derivative rather than primary notion in Western thought. Dewey fails to realize that his lamentation about the separation JOHN J. McDERMOTT 451</page><page sequence="20">of reflection from the method of experience is far more of a sociological problem63 than one to be explicated in philosophical terms. From the point of view of contemporary philosophical thought, experience is simply too vague and bumptious a term to be used as the central cate gory for structuring a logic of inquiry. For one recent commentator: The most basic principle of this 'minimal' empiricism is that all ideas are derived from experience, and the vagueness and ambiguity of the expression 'ideas', 'derived from', and 'experience', pretty well account for the history of modern empiricism.64 We do not, however, discover the reason for the extraordinary priority given to the method of experience in American philosophy, by restrict ing our analysis simply to philosophical language. The setting, after all, was quite different with philosophy elsewhere.65 Randall sees it this way: "American philosophy, come of age by the end of the nineteenth century, could draw on all the different European traditions. That has something to do with the fact that the giants of the last generation could bend them all to the illumination of American experience, in creating a distinctively new and American philosophical attitude and approach."66 Perhaps the major thrust of this illumination is the place given experience itself. In a somewhat different vein, Tillich, in speak ing of the "pragmatic-experimental approach of American theology" can speak of the "emphasis on religious experience in the movements of evangelical radicalism which have largely formed the American mind and have made of experience a central concept in all spheres of man's intellectual life."6,7 Although the history of the meaning of the notion of experience in American life has yet to be written, the American mood, even at the outset, more often than not anticipated the later contention of Emerson that "every ingenious and aspiring soul leaves the doctrine behind him in his own experience."68 The question, of course, is whether this is sim ply a philosophical correlate to the attitude of ingrained condescension to speculative learning—an attitude so cogently expressed in the com mentary on a failure in a colonial Massachusetts iron works, wherein "experience hath outstripped learning here, and the most quick-sighted in the theory of things have been forced to pay pretty roundly to Lady Experience for filling their heads with a little of her active after wit . . ."69 Or is Emerson's text to be read rather as an affirmation of the informing richness of experience as such; indeed, of the cognitive thrust in all events, particularly those through which we locate our selves as persons? Originally biblical in meaning,70 the experience of the new world viewed the "land" as but the site on which the New Jeru salem was to be founded. Given the press of events, however, the focus of expectation soon shifted, and located around the land itself.71 In one of his poems, Thoreau calls for a new future by pointing to possi 452 CROSS CURRENTS: FALL 196S</page><page sequence="21">bilities hardly credible anywhere else in nineteenth-century Western civilization: All things invite this earth's inhabitants To rear their lives to an unheard of height And meet the expectation of the land;72 And in our time, Robert Frost, celebrating what he hoped was a new beginning, significantly repeats the refrain of Thoreau: To the land vaguely realizing westward, But still unstoried, artless, unenhanced, Such as she was, such as she would become.73 The energizing to meet and engage the "expectations of the land" is but one version of the overreaching dominance of situation over theory. Experience as sociological environment trumps philosophical thought at every turn. This is stated with clarity by Boorstin: Through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries—from Creve coeur's notion that America had produced a new man, through Jefferson's belief in the wealth, promise, and magnificence of the continent, and Turner's faith in a frontier-born culture and fron tier-nourished institutions—runs the refrain that American values spring from the circumstances of the New World, that these are the secret of the "American Way of Life." This refrain has been both an example of our special way of dealing with ideas and an encouragement to it. For lack of a better word, we may call this a leaning toward implicitness, a tendency to leave ideas embodied in experience and a belief that the truth somehow arises out of the experience. This carries with it a preference for the relevance of ideas as against their form and a surprising unconcern for the separability of ideas. We have seldom believed that the validity of an idea was tested by its capacity for being expressed in words. The beliefs that values come out of the context and that truth is part of the matrix of experience (and hardly separable from it) become themselves part of the way of American thinking—hence, the form lessness of American thought, its lack of treatises, schools and systems.74 It would seem that we should more openly admit that vision is most creative when it acknowledges an interaction within the actual limita tions of our situation. In writing of James, Robert Pollock clarifies this problem: James was endeavoring to take seriously the fact that reality does not address itself to abstract minds but to living persons inhabiting a real world, to whom it makes known something of its essential quality only as they go out to meet it through action. It is this concrete relation of man and his world, realized in action, which accounts for the fact that our power of affirmation outruns our knowledge, as when we feel or sense the truth before we know it.75 JOHN J. McDERMOTT 453</page><page sequence="22">The work of analysis in American life has to take into account the powerful assumption about experience as self-revealing as well as the living inseparability of world and action. Thought, traditionally, has no privileged place in the American scheme. The burden of this paper is that such an arrangement has been fortunate in relation to our cul ture, and should be abandoned only with great caution. Conclusion At times contemporary reflective thought in America seems to identify itself only by locating around a response to what is considered the tra ditional hostility to the intellectual. Such a response only confronts a by-product of what is actually a long-standing and general cultural effort to rework the nature of thought in terms of its functional role within the total human endeavor. From the Puritans to Dewey, one is offered a series of efforts, alternating in stresses and varying in success, to account for man's most profound difficulties and concerns within the context of ordinary experience. In that tradition, all-embracing systematic truth, whether it be theological, philosophical or political, was consistently submitted to the broadly based canons of a constantly shifting collective experience. Inevitably these doctrinal stances were broken under the pressure of having to support a more than simply theoretical posture. But there developed a highly sensitive feeling for the riches of experience as a way of reconstructing doctrine rather than as a malleable resource awaiting clarification. The doctrine of an open nature and the perpetual return to the invigoration of frontier language, provide a sense of renewal and local horizon which serves to constantly galvanize energies. As a consequence, what appear to be more basic questions are often left to fend for themselves in the rush of events. Is it not significant that the major thinkers in the American tradition are recalled more for their attitude and openness to possibility, rather than for the specific resolution of the problems they faced? This would seem particularly true of Emerson, James and Dewey, who, despite their concern with matters philosophical, have a mythic type of existence in the American tradition. Vaguely understood as thinkers, but per sonally imbedded in the popular consciousness as classic representations of the American mind, they seem to serve in a nostalgic way as the redoubt against the increased complexity of the modern world. Pre cisely because of this new role as played out in popular culture, technical thought, especially philosophy, tends to bypass such versions of man's situation. In failing to recognize that the American tradition in its emphasis on the method of experience, for purposes of human inquiry, consti tutes a contention of the highest philosophical priority, contemporary American thought has driven a new wedge between the role of phi 454 CROSS CURRENTS: FALL 1965</page><page sequence="23">losophy and the affairs of men. The going assumption often seems to hold that the affection for experience, so notable in earlier American philosophical thought, has a naive and propaedeutic ring to it. As such, it cannot continue as the basis for a response to the increasingly com plex dimensions which manifest themselves as characteristic of in quiry in our time. If this assumption is basically sound, then we must conclude that no matter what its verve and boldness in aviding syste matic thought, the emphasis on experience in previous American thought, while remaining a cultural deposit in the wide sense, has only peripheral philosophical significance. Such a bifurcation, however, falls prey to Dewey's warning that "Philosophy in America will be lost between chewing a historic cud long since reduced to woody fiber, or an apolo getics for lost causes (lost to natural science), or a scholastic, schematic formalism, unless it can somehow bring to consciousness America's own needs and its own implicit principle of successful action."76 By way of summary, our position here contends that the separation of the method of analysis, be it historical or philosophical in concern, from the basic leaning of the culture, has two pejorative results. First, widening Dewey's concern, analysis (particularly so in the academic formulation increasingly characteristic of it) finds itself caught in a circle of self-sustenance, using the same language for both criticism and description with only rare and ineffectual points of contact with the wider culture. Secondly, as the culture develops an increased de pendence on intellectual expertise, there is a tendency to neglect the obligation to conjoin analysis and the reconstruction of experience. It is, after all, far easier to confront the interiorized difficulties relative to each discipline, particularly those of the humanities and social sciences, than it is to take full cognizance of actual events, which by their very nature occur as inter-disciplinary phenomena. It can be granted that the penchant for experience as the major source for the language of inquiry ofte nleads to a lack of rigor and precision in speculative formulations. Yet such an approach has the important advantage of avoiding the deception that accrues to those who assume that events happen readymade for analysis within the striated limitations of single disciplines.71 Openness to experience, with its historical roots in an anthropomorphic view of nature and a sense of frontier as human horizon, is to be understood as more than an outdated cliché. It should be seen rather as a fundamental attitude through which is strained the tasks of intellect, ever pressed to take account of the novelty that is manifested in the onrush of events. Above all, we should accept the stricture of James that: "Experience, as we know, has ways of boiling over, and making us correct our present formulas."78 Such corrections are at the behest of experience but their articulation is the task of reflective reconsideration and reformulation.79 We must strive to insti JOHN J. McDERMOTT 455</page><page sequence="24">tutionalize this dialectic between the press of experience and the wisdom of reflection. Let Peirce have the last word. An American philosopher of the first rank and no sentimentalist on these matters, he tells us that "without beating longer round the bush let us come to close quarters. Experience is our only teacher." And "how does this action of experience take place? It takes place by a series of surprises."80 NOTES 1 George Santayana, Character and Opinion in the United States (New York, 1956) 20. 2 America will not have forever to articulate her specific 'angle of vision', cf. James Bryce, The American Commonwealth, ed. Louis Hacker (New York, 1959) (1888), I, 1. In 1888, Bryce wrote about American institutions as follows: "They represent an experiment in the rule of the multitude, tried on a scale unprecedently vast, and the results of which everyone is concerned to watch. And yet they are something more than an experiment, for they are believed to disclose and display the type of in stitutions towards which, as by a law of fate, the rest of civilized mankind are forced to move, some with swifter, others with slower, but all with unresting feet." The scene has shifted drastically, and this is no longer so, for there are again several options extant as to structuring basic political and social institutions, and in many areas, the American version is out of favor. No small reason for this is the often inept and unfeeling way in which America has expressed the qualities of her own tradition. 3 "The American Angle of Vision—I: Historical Dimensions," Cross Currents, XV (Winter 1965) 69-93. ·» Ralph Waldo Emerson, "Introduction," Works, I (Boston, 1903) 3. 5 Sidney E.

Burke cites a 1929 textbook written for children of the Soviet Union. "We must discover and conquer the country in which we live. It is a tremendous country, but not yet entirely ours. Our steppe will truly become ours only when we come with columns of tractors and plows to break the thou sand-year-old virgin soil. On a far-flung front we must wage war. We must borrow into the earth, break rocks, dig mines, construct houses..." And again, the remark of a Russian plant scientist that "we can expect no favors from Nature: our job is to take them." Ideology aside, there is still an inadequately analyzed parallel be tween the relationship of frontier and technology, as operative in both societies. The difference seems to be located in the articulated symbolism of the meaning of fron tier for American life in all its endeavors. 36 John M. Anderson, The Individual and the New World (State College, 1955) 10. 37 Ibid., 181 n. 41. 38 Sanford, op. cit., 112-113. 39 Anderson, op. cit., 89. 40 Winthrop Hudson, American Protestantism (Chicago, 1961) 126. 41 The primitive strain in the American view of time and nature is particularly fascinating because it is structured outside of the 'primitive' and pre-historical doctrine of nature as cyclic. Cf. Mircea Eliade, Cosmos and History—The Myth of the Eternal Return (New York, 1959), especially 1-92. 42 cf. Tillich, art. cit., 34, where speaking of Greek culture, he claims that: "They have rio dynamic trend to go beyond it. They are in space, fulfilling it with divine force, bound to their space, expressing the tragic limitation of it. Greek reason never was able to overcome this limitation. Even the logic of Aristotle is a spatial logic, unable to express the dynamic trend of time. There is no philosophy of history in Greek thought, and where history is dealt with it is considered as only a section of the long circular motion of the whole cosmos from birth to death, of one world replacing the other. Time is swallowed by space in this cosmological tragedy." 43 The necessarily anthropomorphic character of all views about man's place in the world is argued by Martin Versfeld, "Reflections on Evolutionary Knowledge," International Philosophical Quarterly, V (May 1965) 221-247. 44 Paul Tillich, "The Conquest of Intellectual Provincialism: Europe and America," Theology of Culture, 176. 45 Nature and time have been much less adequately treated from the philosophical 458 CROSS CURRENTS: FALL 1965</page><page sequence="27">side in American thought. An exception is the classic work of John Dewey, Ex perience and Nature (New York, 1952) (1929). Actually, all three themes are analyzed in a series of essays by John Herman Randall, Jr., Nature and Historical Experience (New York, 1958). 46 William James, The Letters of William James, 2 vols., (Boston, 1920), I, 235. 47 Robert O. Johann, "The Return to Experience," The Review of Metaphysics, XVII (March, 1964) 329. 48 Each commentator attempts this from a different angle, that of Johann being the potentially fruitful one of a metaphysical personalism. Another recent attempt, from the side of the behavioral sciences, is that of B. A. Farrell, "Experience," The Philosophy of Mind, ed. V. C. Chappell (New York, 1962) 23-48. 4» William James, Essays in Radical Empiricism (New York, 1947) (1912) 10. Johann, art. cit., 324 arrives at a similar position. δ" John Dewey, Experience and Nature, 2 ed., (New York, 1958) (1929), 8. 61 Johann, art. cit., 329. 62 cf. Seymour Martin Lipset, "American Intellectuals: Their Politics and Statue," Political Man (New York, 1963) 332-371. Lipset, correctly, I believe, argues that the anti-intellectualism found in American life does not result in low status for intel lectuals. 63 Richard Hofstadter, Anti-Intellectualism in American Life (New York, 1963) 49-50. 64 Gulian C. Verplanck, "The Advantages and Dangers of the American Scholar," American Philosophic Addresses, 1700-1900, ed. Joseph L.

John Dewey, Philosophy and Civilization (New York, 1963) (1931) and John Dewey, Logic: The Theory of Inquiry (New York, 1938). et In an earlier series of essays, Dewey had argued in great detail that "knowledge" is a narrow category and falls short of revealing the manifold ways in which ex perience teaches. Cf. The Influence of Darwin and Other Essays in Contemporary Thought (New York, 1951) (1910). The essays on "The Experimental Theory of Knowl edge," 77-111; "Experience and Objective Idealism," 198-225; and "The Postulate of Immediate Empiricism," 226-241, are particularly relevant. 62 These texts are found in Dewey, "The Need For A Recovery of Philosophy," 23. Dewey takes an historical point of view on this issue in "An Empirical Survey of Empiricisms," On Experience, Nature and Freedom, 70-87. 63 An unassimilated but fascinating account of the sociological dimensions in Ameri can classical philosophy is to be found in C. Wright Mills, Sociology and Pragmatism, ed. Irving Louis Horowitz (New York, 1964). 64 Alan Pasch, Experience and the Analytic—A Reconsideration of Empiricism (Chicago, 1958) 5. 65 One of the few treatments of this setting is found in George H.

In speaking of the contribution of American thought, he comments that "It adds a JOHN J. MeDERMOTT 459</page><page sequence="28">new level to the long tradition of Western philosophical thought because it brings the lessons learned from American experience to all the lessons men had learned before and left for us in the embodied philosophical wisdom of the past." et Tillich, "The Conquest of Intellectual Provincialism: Europe and America," 164.

Ό The persistent biblicism of American life has been insufficiently treated or else viewed in narrow doctrinal terms. A good introductory statement is found in Joseph Gaer and Ben Siegel, The Puritan Heritage—America's Roots in the Bible (New York, 1964), cf. also Williams, op. cit. 11 The complex symbolism that accompanies America's attempt to retain the biblical metaphor but yet avoid the literalism and religious orthodoxy that accom pany such a tradition is of central importance to the development of American thought, at all levels. It is unfortunate that the important work of Robert Pollock in this critical area remains largely unpublished. Sf. his "Ralph Waldo Emerson— The Single Vision," American Classics Reconsidered, ed.

II Education as a discipline offers an instructive illustration. To the extent that it remains tied to its own categories, aridity and pretense dominate. To the extent that it opens itself up to the language and concerns of the wider culture, as, for example, technology or the sociology of the school, the discipline is revivified. Cf. Ronald Gross and Judith Murphy, ed., The Revolution in the Schools (New York, 1964). 18 William James, Pragmatism (New York, 1947) (1907) 222. cf. also William James, A Pluralistic Universe (New York, 1947) (1909) 212, "Reality, life, experience, con creteness, immediacy, use what word you will, exceeds our logic, overflows and sur rounds it." 19 Cf. James Feibleman, An Introduction to Peirce's Philosophy (New York, 1946) 200, where, in a paraphrase of Peirce, he states, "Experience contains an element which is forceful and unavoidable, and yet requires an act of attention to appreciate fully." 80 Charles Sanders Peirce, Collected Papers, ed., Charles Hartshorne and Paul Weiss (Cambridge, 1934), V, sec. 50, 51, p. 37. 460 CROSS CURRENTS: FALL 1965</page></plain_text>
