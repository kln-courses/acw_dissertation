Indeed, the tourist experience can be quite a shocker- perhaps more disturbingly so when its conventions of display and appropriation pass unnoticed. In her book, Staging Tourism: Bodies on Display From Waikiki to Sea World, Professor Desmond transforms her initial reactions into a full-scale analysis that is both rigorously researched and affectingly represented. As the subtitle suggests, Staging Tourism includes a number of examples. The first half of the book investigates Hawaiian tourist performance, specifically focusing on Waikiki; the second explores the display of animals, including sites such as Marine World, the Monterrey Bay Aquarium, and Sea World. Throughout, Desmond is interested in tracking how tourist displays create embodied representations of the "natural," the human, the family, and the primitive past, transforming discourses of gender, scientific racism, and colonialism into spectacu- lar forms. Along the way, Desmond argues for the utility of a performance paradigm in the analysis of tourism. As an interdiscipli- nary field that combines theories from anthropology, sociology, media studies, folklore and more, performance studies offers a "more fully embodied concept of the tourist, expanding the notion of the 'tourist gaze' to include other embodied aspects of experience (movement, Shannon Jackson, author of Lines of Activity: Performance, Historiography, Hull- House Domesticity, is an associate professor of rhetoric and of theater, dance, and performance studies at University of California, Berkeley American Quarterly, Vol. 53, No. 4 (December 2001) Â© 2001 American Studies Association 703</page><page sequence="2">704 AMERICAN QUARTERLY sound, touch, and so forth) both in the physical and imaginary realms" (xxi). Using her skills as both a dancer and a scholar, Desmond seeks to foreground the kinesthetic dimensions of experience, suggesting how such realms use a kind of "physical foundationalism" to instantiate unequal relations of power (xiv). The analysis of Hawaiian tourist performance draws from a range of documents. Desmond has delved into the archives of the Sheraton hotel, analyzed the oral histories of Hawaiian performers at the Midway Plaisance, and poured over photographs, postcards, travel brochures and other souvenirs of "Hawaiiana" (19). Indeed, Staging Tourism is particularly interesting in its use of several types of synchronic and diachronic methodologies. One of the first chapters offers a thick description of her contemporary fieldsite in Waikiki, describing in the ethnographic present a "typical" tourist recreation of the lu'au. More of the chapters in this half of the book are organized historically, however. They include early representations of Hawai'i from 1880 to 1915 in order to track the period after the U.S. government otherthrew Queen Lili'uokalani's monarchy. Subsequent chapters situate ads, pamphlets, films, hotels, songs, and changing cultural performances within an increasingly complex commodity culture in the United States at mid-century. Desmond is careful to position such historical documents as representational practices. She imports a theory of the souvenir to her analysis of the postcard and its role in constituting a tourist imaginary. She considers the history of the stereoscope and the operations of perspective in her analysis of photographs, showing how the arrangement of celluloid bodies posi- tioned performers and spectators-native and tourist-in a spectacu- larly hierarchized relation. Throughout her analysis of these and other tourist mechanisms, Desmond is particularly attuned to their synec- dochic and "decontemporarizing" effects. Reconsistuted narratives, images, and performances installed the belief that single representa- tions-a lei, a song, a tropical drink-could stand in for an entire Hawaiian culture. Moreover-and in a familiar primitivist move- Hawaiian culture was continually framed as an element of the past rather than as extant, dynamic, and contemporary. The lu'au and the hula are of course some of the most significant performances in the construction and consumption of "Hawai'i" as a tourist destination. As such, they provide the occasion for a variety of exploratory critiques. Such performances are central to the maintenance</page><page sequence="3">TOURISM AND PERFORMANCE 705 of what Desmond calls Hawai'i's "soft primitivism," a representation that "proffers a gentle, sensuous encounter with difference, different enough to be presented as 'alluring' but not threatening" (12). Installed within an Americanized version of a colonial encounter, this kind of qualified exoticism was and is key to perpetuating a tourist identity, promising a happy and harmonious cross-cultural exchange that is always fascinating and never fractious. A particular kind of mixed racial imagery supported the Hawaiian fantasy over the course of the last century. To a Caucasian mainlander, the Hawaiian encounter has historically bypassed the tensions of African American cross-racial interactions. At the same time, early travel publications were careful to make sure that Native Hawaiians were not equated with "American Indians," another set of Native Americans whose subordinated history was less easy to disavow. In promotional ads and on-site performances, the circulation of the hapa haole furthered the escape from mainland racial politics, presenting mixed-race faces of both Polynesian and Caucasian heritage that solidified the image of intercultural harmony. Furthermore, gendered stereotypes appeared at formative moments in Hawaiian tourist history. It is significant, for instance, that the hula became most conventionally aligned with the hula girl rather than a hula boy. Desmond notes how representations and tourist rituals such as the offered lei, the welcoming kiss, and the revelation of the hula belly placed Hawaiian women as central performing objects. In many respects, to say that one is studying the exoticizing operations of Hawaiian tourism is to anticipate an argument before it begins, one where privileged Caucasian tourists (often men) consume the bodies and culture of subordinated Native Hawaiians (often women) -enthusiastically, obliviously, repetitively. As such, the analysis of specific cases can occasionally become generalized, predictable, and determinist. Indeed, the first half of Staging Tourism contains a few critiques that are somewhat formulaic and, over time, repetitive. More satisfying are the moments when Desmond teases out other dimensions and variations. Her account of Germaine's Luau (one of two main commercial companies in Honolulu) demonstrates how substantively the performance of heterosexuality between tourists undergirds the presentation of the exotic to tourists. Other cases alter the familiar elision between male/female and tourist/native. An analysis of the "Beach Boy" shows how the thrill of cross-racial sexuality animated the tourist industry's appeals to a female consumer. At another point,</page><page sequence="4">706 AMERICAN QUARTERLY that female consumer is placed in a homosocial relation, identifying with and as a Hawaiian girl through accessories, clothing, and the embodied experience of a hula lesson. Finally, Desmond occasionally complicates overdetermined hierachies by acknowledging a "con- tinuum" between more and less exploitative performances and by allowing for the possibility that certain tourist productions use the defamiliarizing techniques of a "Brechtian" performance mode (30, 260). Part two of Staging Tourism takes on a very different brand of tourist performance-the display of animals. Rather than beginning with a sense of shock, however, this section intriguingly begins with a sense of enthusiasm. Desmond recalls one of her first visits to an animal theme park and how she "wildly" waved her hand when a trainer called for a volunteer. "I was struck by how much I wanted to do this, to go to the side of a huge tank of water, and to stand there waiting for the ten thousand pound killer whale 'Yaka' . . . to receive her 'kiss' on my cheek" (146). In many ways, the difference in Desmond's personal investment in this topic also yields different modes of investigation. While the author's self-presentation is largely resistant and often appalled in the first half of the book, her analysis in the second half seems somewhat more careful and curious. Throughout the investigation of animal display, the "performance of the natural" recurs as a constant theme, an extension and, in some cases, an inversion of the concept of "physical foundationalism." All zoos, aquariums, and animal parks advertise the opportunity to become acquainted with nature; however, the character of that acquaintance changes with the site. Each finds different ways of navigating the paradox of animal display, one where nature "stands in for wildness and uncontrollability, not subject to the constraints of culture, while simultaneously being wholly produced by it in the theatrical frame- work" (151). Desmond expands upon the vocabulary of ethnographic performance to define and critique varying methods. She uses the categories of "in fake situ," "in situ," and "out of situ" to frame differences in spectacle, environment, audience proximity, and narra- tive presentation. The Monterrey Bay Aquarium offers an example of the first category. Here, the apparatus of performance is built around and atop the environment it simultaneously displays. Producing a "simulacrum of the site it sits on," the aquarium performs nature by both avowing and disavowing its own intervention (186). "Real sea water," is pumped into one typical exhibit through an elaborate system</page><page sequence="5">TOURISM AND PERFORMANCE 707 of pumps and filters. The technical feat invokes the discourse of the natural while simultaneously "making the wild organisms domestic, totally dependent on the human apparatus for their continued survival" (178). The ecotourist park at Ana Nuevo provides an illustration of the "in-situ" category. Here, visitors enter the animals' "natural habitat" as if its purity and authenticity have not been compromised by their own presence as spectators. At the other end of the presentational con- tinuum, places such as Marine World make less effort to hide the mechanics of display and thus develop different frames (sometimes individuating, sometimes acrobatic, sometimes educational) to mediate the human-animal relationship. Indeed, throughout her study, Desmond locates a variety of means for producing "cross-species" connection. Of particular concern is whether an animal is, as she says, a "candidate for anthropomorphism" (184). In such instances, audiences are encouraged to receive animal behaviors within conventions of human performance, seeing random gestures, noises, and movements as indexes of an almost humanness. At places such as Sea World or the bird show at Marine World Africa USA, such readings are produced through intense training. Once again, the covert conventions of "natural performance" re-emerge. Perform- ing the paradox of "freedom in captivity," birds "'choose' to fly on cue" and whales express themselves through codified choreography (202, 228). The performance of sex and reproduction create another dimen- sion of cross-species connection. "Our stake in scrutinizing animal reproduction, called sex, is not so much to find out how they do it, but why we do it" (192). At various kinds of exhibits, reproduction is highly narrativized, often in ways that reinforce nuclear family struc- tures. By locating husbands and fathers, wives and mothers within the reproductive act, a circular process of reinforcement occurs. A social construct is deployed to define the natural while the natural serves as a foundation to legitimate the social construct. Staging Tourism is both a provocative project and a well-researched one. Nevertheless-and without minimizing its accomplishments-it is important to note that the book seemed to lack a kind of self- integration. In many ways, its two halves appeared to be two different projects. There are occasional references in the first half to the second; additionally, Desmond appeals to the notion of "staging the natural" as a unifying frame. However, the examples are never organized as a comparative study of human and animal performance. It is interesting</page><page sequence="6">708 AMERICAN QUARTERLY to speculate on why this does not occur-and on what would happen if it did. For instance, Desmond cites the 1915-16 Panama-California International Exposition as a key event in the histories of both Hawaiian and animal display. A thorough analysis of such a site might have demonstrated how the conventions of human and animal perfor- mance inform each other and whether or not there are political and ethical differences between such spectacles. The methodological differ- ences between the two halves of the book also contribute to the sense of non-integration. The first is a "single-site" investigation; the second is "multi-site" ethnography. It would have been useful to hear more reflection on the logic of these two approaches. If multiple sites allow a researcher to show variation, why is this approach warranted for animal performance and not for Hawaiian? Does Waikiki effectively function as an index of "Hawai'i"? In both sections of Staging Tourism, there is also an appeal to an historical argument; however, they operate on very different scales. In Waikiki, the reader is presented with a decade by decade excavation of a one-hundred year history. The history of animal display, however, receives a much shorter treatment and paradoxically covers a much longer time span, beginning with "blood sport' spectacles" from the third-century B.C. and animal parades in 55 B.C. (156). Finally, the sense of non-integration can appear within sections as well as between them. As noted above, Desmond uses an impressive mixture of methods. She ends her study of representational practices in Hawaiian tourism with a demographic account and class analysis of the very different kinds of tourist groups that travel to Hawai'i (a study of racial difference, she notes, was not available to her). Hearing of this variation at the end or in footnotes, the reader is left to wonder whether it would have structured differently the con- sumption of all these tourist performances-whether participation in a lu-au, self-adornment in Hawaiian costume, or an encounter with a "beach boy" might have varied dynamics depending upon class status. Staging Tourism will be of interest to scholars from a variety of fields and subfields. For American studies scholars, this text elucidates the intra-colonial dynamics of U.S. national expansion. It also contrib- utes significantly to secondary literature on American popular culture. Desmond is also very aware that "tourism" has itself become a kind of subfield. She cites Dean McCannell's ground-breaking work, extend- ing and revising his paradigms as well as those of other scholars. Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett's models of tourist display prove to be</page><page sequence="7">TOURISM AND PERFORMANCE 709 particularly useful, especially when they illuminate the fundamentals of animal spectacle. As the use of the term "staging" implies, Desmond self-consciously locates this book within the interdisciplinary field of performance studies as well. The notion of "physical foundationalism" is part of this positioning, demonstrating how bodies are deployed to ground perceptions of the real. In her analysis of festive events, of gazing relations, of costume, spectacle, and gesture, Desmond shows the many ways that such determining embodiments take shape. It is worth remembering, however, that the role of performance can be a complicated one. As many a theorist of performance has argued, performance can be an enactment that grounds a represented story, but it is also a processual medium that remains vulnerable to lapses in enactment. While determining in some instances, it is also the site of improvisations and alternate repetitions that can puncture a represented ideological narrative. Only occasionally does Desmond acknowledge this realm. For instance, she recognizes that "face to face contact" with performers after Hawaiian shows "may have mediated the primitivizing" (108). More of an emphasis on the mediations and improvisations of embodiment-whether "face to face" or otherwise-might have of- fered a less determined representation of tourist performance, one where individual performers work within but also against the conven- tions of exoticization. The concept of "physical foundationalism" would still be operative, but it would have been complemented by an awareness of the volatility of the physical-its capacity to chip and sometimes to demolish the very "foundations" that it simultaneously installs. These qualifications only testify to the range and ambition of a very provocative project. Staging Tourism: Bodies on Display from Waikiki to Sea World is extensively research and filled with intriguing analyses. Jane Desmond has accomplished a great deal in one book. Her arguments, her methods, and her energetic prose will inspire a wide readership.</page></plain_text>
