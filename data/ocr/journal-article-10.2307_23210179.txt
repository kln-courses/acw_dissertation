<plain_text><page sequence="1">MATT ASHBY Williamsburg 2000: Reflections on the Colonial Artist ... So soft upon the Scene The Act of evening fell We felt how neighborly a Thing Was the invisible — Emily Dickinson1 True rebels, after all, are as rare as true lovers, and, in both cases, to mistake a fever for a passion can destroy one's life. —-James Baldwin2 In the back of an art gallery on Driggs Avenue, two life sized plastic horses sat human-like on their rears. One of them had an oversized, anthropomorphic vagina. The other had a proportionately large anthropomorphic erection. Their faces whinnied with teeth flash ing and lips aquiver. Over the past thirty years, Willamsburg Brooklyn has come to be known partly for its art scene. A neighborhood gallery collective produces a monthly listing of openings. On the backside of the pamphlet, dots on a street map mark some twenty-five gallery locations hidden among the rundown factories and warehouses ofWilliamsburg's postindustrial cityscape.The next venue I stumbled into displayed a series of pinkish, peach-colored paintings of what looked to be blow-up dolls with huge breasts, thin waists, and hairless vaginas, all clustered together like balloons. On another occasion, I visited an exclusively illustrative gallery. Idealized anime figures stood naked inside idealized nature settings. At a different show,TV screens looped short videos of two people having sex on a beach, both of them wearing gigantic Santa masks. I watched one of the screens waiting for the horses to show up or the anime women to emerge from the water, pelted and glistening. In 2004, ArtForutn noted Williamsburg as one of the largest art com munities in the world, with over 10,000 artists.3 I wonder about this 146</page><page sequence="2">statistic and how it was determined. Are the artists self-proclaimed, a box checked off on a survey? What constitutes an artist? At almost any time of day, but particularly if it's sunny, a legion of Williamsburg's Northside residents gather at McCarren Park, a green space that shares a border with Greenpoint, the northwesternmost region of Brooklyn. They tan on blankets, play football, co-ed kickball, guitars, drink coffees and check phones. They are young and 90percent white. When I use the term white, I want to make the distinction that I'm referring to a U.S.-made concept, a race that subsumes the backgrounds of those with fair skin and bestows upon them the history, current manifestations, and consciousness of white supremacy. Many of these young white folks have tattoos, edgy hairstyles, and skin-tight clothing with accessories such as sunglasses that take up half a face. Hipster is the term, often used derisively, associated with these fashion affectations. In 2007, Christian Lorentzen of Time Out New York outlined his understanding of the contemporary hipster: Under the guise of "irony," hipsterism fetishizes the authentic and regurgitates it with a winking inauthenticity. Those 18-to-34-year olds called hipsters have defanged, skinned and consumed the fringe movements of the postwar era—Beat, hippie, punk, even grunge. Hungry for more, and sick with the anxiety of influence, they feed as well from the trough of the uncool, turning white trash chic, and gouging the husks of long-expired subcultures—vaudeville, bur lesque, cowboys and pirates. Of course, hipsterism being originally, and still mostly, the province of whites (the pastiest of whites), its acolytes raid the cultural stores of every unmelted ethnicity in the pot. Similarly, they devour gay style: Witness the cultural burp known as metrosexuality. As the hipster ambles from the thrift store to a $100 haircut at Freemans Sporting Club, these aesthetics are assimilated—cannibalized—into a repertoire of meaninglessness, from which the hipster can construct an identity in the manner of a collage, or a shuffled playlist on an iPod. 4 Although his description is superficially accurate, and his final point crucial to investigate further, Lorentzen takes the same sanctimonious, vitriolic tone he later ascribes to certain hipsters. "Why the Hipster Must Die: A Modest Proposal to Save New York Cool" condemns the so-called hipster for unoriginality while ironically deriving part of its title from the classic Jonathan Swift satire. It is risky to grade the authenticity of cultural phenomena, given that they all have their influences; perhaps it is the case that the movements we now perceive as authentic were simply the most artful at exploiting (or respectfully referencing) their influences. 147</page><page sequence="3">THE MASSACHUSETTS REVIEW Among New York City's young, predominantly white, social circles, living in Williamsburg has the connotation that one is a hipster, maybe subsisting on a trust fund, a wannabe musician, graphic designer, or artist of some sort. This association refers only to a small subset of Williamsburg's inhabitants and inaccurately represents the greater neighborhood and its textured history. The framework and demographics of modern-day Wil liamsburg were largely shaped by the creation of the Williamsburg Bridge in 1903. At the turn of the twentieth century, the Lower East Side of Manhattan had some of the worst poverty and living conditions in the his tory of the country. Recently freed blacks, Irish, Italian, Russian, German, Polish, and Jewish immigrants vied for limited resources in untenable tenements.The Williamsburg Bridge touched down in the middle of this teeming cauldron, and many of these people hurried across to Brooklyn for living space. Within ten years, Williamsburg's population blew up to more than twice its size at 250,000 people.5 One street housed 5,000 residents, the most crowded block in New York City at the time.6 The expanding population worked at the nearby Navy Yard, as well as in the factories, foundries, and refineries of the East River waterfront, producing glass, porcelain, books, sugar, and petroleum.7 In time, however, these industries moved elsewhere and the Navy Yard shut down. From 1960 to 1990, over 200,000 local jobs vanished.8 Williamsburg sunk into its own depression with nearly 50 percent of its residents living below the poverty line.9 The afflictions of poverty followed. In the 1970s and '80s, vacant industrial buildings became ideal drug dens and, for some destitute artists, affordable lofts to live and work in. Currently, Williamsburg has only about 125,000 people, half of the amount from a century ago. The year 2000 census found the population is around 49 percent Hispanic (predominantly Puerto Rican with increas ing numbers of Dominicans and Ecuadorians), 40 percent non-Hispanic white (primarily Hasidim, with some Italians, Poles, and increasing num bers of so-called hipsters whose background and race have been histori cally subsumed into the U.S. concept of" white."), 9 percent non-His panic black (many foreign-born), and 2 percent Asian (from all over).10 Furthermore, 80 percent of the schoolchildren speak English as a second language at home.11 This means that families speaking Spanish, Hebrew, and, in lesser amounts, Polish and Italian, make up more than three quarters of the population. The young, white, so-called hipster subgroup can be only a small slice of the 125,000 and hardly representative of Williamsburg as a whole. 148</page><page sequence="4">Matt Ashby Because hipster is an ambiguous term and is best represented by an aesthetic, I've been using it almost interchangeably to represent the re ported 10,000 artists living in the neighborhood. While I recognize not all of these self-proclaimed artists are white, I would venture that more than 85 percent of the young, white people in the neighborhood include themselves among the artists living there. Going by the 2000 census, we can estimate there are only about 10,000 or 12,000 white people who are not Hispanic or progeny of the Polish and Italian immigrants who earlier filled the neighborhood. If 85 percent of these new-resident white people are self-proclaimed artists, this means that the vast majority of those 10,000 neighborhood artists are white. Why are so many of these so called artists white? Historically, "being an artist" has predominantly been the province of the wealthy and privileged. Of course, no one group has a monopoly on art-making, but the wealthy do have the opportunity to choose "being an artist" as a lifestyle, rather than as the unavoidable an swer to a calling. My guess is that many of the self-proclaimed artists of Williamsburg are doing just this, choosing art as a lifestyle, believing it to be associated with certain superficial traits with which they think they identify: hipness, freedom, righteousness, edgy fashion, and rebellion. Some people, I've actually found, have oriented themselves by partner preference. They want to be artsy because they want a partner who looks and, to a degree, acts like an artist, whatever stereotype, myth, or freakish aberration they imagine that to be. I lived in Williamsburg for the last four years of the 2000 decade. My close friend and roommate worked as a research coordinator and painted. I worked as a librarian and wrote. We had a small two-bedroom apartment on Havemeyer and Hope Street at the southern border of Williamsburg's Northside. For nearly two years, another good friend lived on our couch, but he clocked an average of eighty hours a week at the biggest law firm in the world.The painter used what was left of our living room as a makeshift studio, rolling around little carts full of painting sup plies. He covered the widest wall with a drop sheet of plastic and painted canvases hung on a two-by-four lined with screws. I usually wrote after my roommates went to bed because I often felt compelled to wander the neighborhood in the evenings. Together, our apartment appeared to house the quintessential young white Williamsburg ensemble. 149</page><page sequence="5">THE MASSACHUSETTS REVIEW During my stay in Williamsburg, I was reluctant to tell anyone where I lived; in New York City, one's neighborhood is sometimes perceived as an extension of one's identity. "So you're a hipster," I heard. "Ohhh, Williams burg," others said. Often, I would try to disassociate myself from the neigh borhood by giving the history of how I ended up there. My expected roommate worked on the Upper West Side at 168th Street. We couldn't afford Manhattan, nor did I want to live there. His commute would already be around an hour from Williamsburg, and he was unfamiliar with the nether regions of Brooklyn. Most important, we had two good friends who lived in the neighborhood already. As the youngest of three brothers close in age, I have a complex about being prejudged. I like to remain unaffiliated with groups, labels, words not defined by me, and locations of any sort (except for the region my mother is from in southwestern France). Living in Williamsburg stoked my sensitivities because I superficially fit the bill in some ways. I was in my twenties and white. Hand-me-downs made up half my wardrobe. The other half came from thrift stores. Everything secondhand. Sentimentality and frugality are probably the two most prominent principles guiding what I wear. As I child, I wore the same ballcap and red gumboots for all occasions. I've been wearing certain shirts of my dad's for fifteen years. I'm indignant about the price of clothing, especially when it's seconhand and still expensive. Aside from weather appropriateness, what I reach for in the closet is often determined by how it feels both tactually and emotionally, which is partly influenced by the experiential history of that particular piece of clothing. Throw in the fact that I haven't ever shaven regularly and, at a glance, my piecemeal, sentiment-inflected, frugal style vaguely resembled the grunge and grit of other young white people of the neigh borhood. A closer inspection would show my outfits to be rather outsized, untagged, and unremarkable—unless, perhaps, one knew the story or bargain behind them. In different and overlapping ways, my roommates and I were (to greater or lesser degrees) alienated by the experience of living in Williamsburg. The painter once remarked, "Every time I go out [to a bar in Williams burg], I feel like I'm at a house party I wasn't directly invited to." I would take this further. For me, I didn't really relate to the way people were re lating or to the environments in which they were relating, but I feel this way in most contexts outside of individual interactions. Still, I was struck by all the barriers.The disconnection.The social subdivisions.Wasn't one of art's fundamental concerns the practice of relating? These people were 150</page><page sequence="6">Matt Ashby artists, right? What was going on here? Everyone seemed cordoned off as a group and as individuals. Although the young, white, so-called hipster, self proclaimed artist subset ofWilliamsburg made up only 10 to 15 percent of the neighborhood's total population, we cultivated a largely isolated cultural enclave, unassimilated and, to some extent, geographically separated. As with most neighborhoods, people and commercial activity con gregate around transportation hubs. The L-train links Williamsburg's Northside to 14th Street in Manhattan, from First to Eighth Avenue. Bedford Avenue is the first stop the train makes coming from under the East River into Brooklyn. Less than ten minutes from the subway nexus of Union Square, realty prices progressively increase in proximity to the Bedford stop. The J, M, and Z trains travel over the Williamsburg Bridge, joining Williamsburg's Southside with the Lower East Side of Manhattan. The young white enclave dominates Williamsburg's North side, from Bushwick to Kent Avenues east to west, and McCarren Park to Grand Street north to south.The Hispanic community lives primarily below Grand Street and above Broadway, which is an unofficial border to the Hasidic community that encompasses nearly the entire lower half of Williamsburg. From Graham to Havemeyer, there are pockets of Italian families sprinkled along Metropolitan Avenue. And, of course, the Polish community of Greenpoint still has small numbers in North Williamsburg around McCarren Park.The highest concentration of young, white, self proclaimed artists falls inside a box of streets nearly as exclusive as the Hasidic community of the Southside. From the East River to the second Brooklyn L stop at Lorimer Street, north to McCarren Park and south to Grand, at the time of my stay, this was the heart of hipster heaven. For almost four years, I walked many of these streets every day, up to the park, down to Broadway, over to Bushwick, zigzagging along Metro politan. I saw something much more sinister than gentrification or a tricky sense of authenticity, and something more unapproachable than diffuse identities. In the eyes and lifestyles of the young white Williams burgians, I saw uncertainty without values. I saw lost people, grasping for hope, for love, without the means or sense of how to go forward, desper ately exploiting themselves just to be seen and recognized. And, perhaps most troubling of all, I saw profound disconnection, the gaps inside and out, and the resulting disaffectedness, indifference, and nihilism. The iPod identity Lorentzen describes as the poisonous hipster aesthetic is not the real problem, just a symptom of the deeper dilemma. The so-called hip sters ofWilliamsburg generally understand identity to be constructed, a 151</page><page sequence="7">THE MASSACHUSETTS REVIEW performance in motion. Yet, they have learned to use their perceived identity as a vehicle for ambition and attention instead of a locus for values and the heart of their vocation. They represent a crisis of calling, not one of cultural authenticity. They lay bare a problem present in all New Yorkers and everyone else, no matter one's background or social identities. This crisis does not ask, Who are you? The so-called hipster spends life chokingly guffawing over this question, ironically aping real ness in anxious evasion of a question that cannot be avoided: What kind of person are you going to be? In No Name in the Street, James Baldwin writes, "No one knows pre cisely how identities are forged, but it is safe to say that identities are not invented: an identity would seem to be arrived at by the way in which the person faces and uses his experience."12 The so-called hipsters I en countered spent their time updating avatars (to quote a friend), franti cally seeking newness which is, by premise, unconcerned with facing or using experience. In short, they were a postmodern pastiche, relativists without a cause. Although the origin is somewhat unknown, likely because it was slang tossed among black jazz musicians of the 1930s, the hepcat and later hip ster were people known to be versed in and representative of cutting edge cultural phenomena. The term was thereafter appropriated by whites and took on a variety of connotations, most prominently defined in Norman Mailers 1957 essay "The White Negro." Mailer argued the hipster was a reaction to the Holocaust and the atomic age, a rebel will ing to live fearlessly in the present by embracing the inevitability of death. In the post-September 11th era, one might easily draw parallels between what Mailer saw as the defining moments in the creation of the hipster and the proliferation of contemporary hipsters. Although the essay is somewhat convoluted, it attempts to explicate the existence of the hip ster, the dance of meaninglessness, hedonism as purity, disintegration as freedom, and other still relevant observations. In the end, however, Mailer s rhapsodies seem to justify the hipsters violent nihilism and celebrate what he sees as the righteous quest for the perfect orgasm. Nevertheless, no matter how feebly unraveled, the connection Mailer makes between America's postwar sense of doom and the everyday experience of black citizens deserves a closer look. Dr. Cornel West has extensively addressed what he called "the nig gerization of America" in the post-September 11th era. After the attacks, the majority of Americans felt "unsafe, subject to random violence, and 152</page><page sequence="8">Matt Ashby hated for who they were." This feeling, West explains, has followed the existence of black people throughout their history in the U.S.13 Given their experience being terrorized in a culture of white Supremacy, Mailer implies, black people provided the framework for the hipster's fearless attitude in the face of nuclear annihilation. However, Mailer portrays the black influence on white counterculture as a mythologized menace, Bigger Thomas with a good groove, romanticizing the possibilities for a world where we all act as amoral free agents (think: Fight Club), whereas West points to examples of people who chose not to act as a counter terroristic "Black Al Qaeda" but who were courageous enough to fight for justice and love to help create a more realized democracy (i.e. Fannie Lou Hamer and Martin Luther King Jr.). In his essay "The Black Boy Looks at the White Boy," James Baldwin brushes on Mailer's "White Negro," a piece he called "impenetrable."14 He saw Mailer as imitating and trying to one-up the absurd mystique of the Beat writers. Baldwin's reading of Mailer becomes an incision point into the contemporary hipster milieu. He writes, "It seemed very clear to me that [the Beat] glorification of the orgasm was but a way of avoid ing the terrors of life and love."15 The pornographic sensibilities ofWil liamsburg's so-called hipsters went beyond the art gallery walls into the circus of sexual escapades that followed their fancied alternative lifestyles. They, too, obsessively sought the ecstatic, be it through drugs, orgiastic indulgence, or commonly some synergistic combination of both. In the following passage on Mailer, Baldwin could easily be addressing the am bitions of many Williamsburg hipsters. "Norman felt compelled to carry [the Beat] mystique further than they had, to be more 'hip,' or more 'beat,' to dominate, in fact, their dreaming field; and since this mystique depended on total rejection of life, and insisted on the fulfillment of an infantile dream of love, the mystique could only be extended into violence."16 Although Baldwin eventually excuses and goes on to encourage the best in Mailer, whom he deemed a dear friend, he saw "The White Negro" as borrowing the language of black people to justify "a grim system of delusions."17 What is the contemporary hipster borrowing, appropriating, exploiting, and is this person doing so to justify any delusions? Are the so-called hip sters ofWilliamsburg fearless countercultural rebels, as Mailer defined and Lorentzen wishes, or are they simply the by-product of fear—people so incapable of facing themselves, so terrorized by responsibility, so affrighted with the need to detach from experience, to come out untouched, to hide 153</page><page sequence="9">THE MASSACHUSETTS REVIEW among one another, that finally they resort to naive cynicism and nihil istic irony as a means of justifying a position of positionlessness? III. External divisions showcase internal barriers, and barriers are usually fortified, if not erected exclusively by, fear. I worked at the New York Public Library in Chinatown, a branch that was, at its idealistic best, an epicenter for democracy in an immigrant neighborhood. Every patron who came to the library, regardless of social identities or class, would re ceive the same service and opportunity to gain access to information, books, and media. But, with nearly half a million visitors a year, the Chat ham Square Branch Library, established in 1903, was hardly a utopia in practice. Mostly, the clerks and librarians struggled to manage the influx of patrons who often demanded preferential treatment or more time than the library team could possibly allocate. More telling, however, was the hierarchical structure of the library, and the divisions of power within the branches. This matter was plainly ad dressed my first day when the branch librarian gave me a chart of author ity within the greater library. Under that template, the baton of hierarchy was passed to the branches in a distinct pecking order: Branch Librarian, then the rest of the staff by seniority within their titles, Senior Librarian(s), Librarians-in-training, Senior Clerk, Information Assistant(s), Clerks, Senior Page, Computer Page, Page(s). Although these lines of authority were somewhat blurred among colleagues, when it came to disagree ments, checks-and-imbalances, they were sharply drawn again. Each position received significantly different pay, while the greatest leaps were accompanied by degree acquisition and seniority. The full librarians held master's degrees that librarians-in-training were actively pursuing. Infor mation Assistants, who did much of the same work as the librarians, had only bachelor's degrees and were paid two-thirds of a librarian's (relative to the New York City's standard of living) meager salary. The clerks had only completed high school degrees, and the pages were usually neigh borhood kids in high school. The hierarchy was not lost on the pages, however, because they often did the work of every position while being paid only minimum wage — an insidious side effect of unchecked power imbalance. The people at the bottom do the work of those at the top. Rather than a microcosm of democracy, at its idealistic worst, the library often more closely resembled a microcosm of free-market capitalism. 154</page><page sequence="10">Matt Ashby The demographic composition of the totem pole provided further evidence. Although I primarily worked at Chatham Square, I clustered with five other South District branches where the makeup was often similar. Librarians and information assistants were disproportionately white, whereas, clerks and pages were disproportionately black and brown. Furthermore, librarians often floated around and advanced in position with a sense of mobility, while comparatively, the clerks stayed in their position, and sometimes branch, for years. Maybe I was imagining things, but the library seemed to represent the reality of U.S. democracy more than the ideal. Not everyone shared equal opportunity, and those at the bottom were exploited and hamstrung by a rigid and slightly authoritarian order. What were these divisions hiding? What was this order suggesting? And, how was it creating or reinforcing social barriers? In Williamsburg, there were similar divisions, similar barriers. The working class and racially, ethnically, and religiously diverse dispropor tionately took the rusted-up, busted-up J, M, and Z trains, the conductor incoherently grumbling the stops over the PA. The white profession als, so-called hipsters, and self-proclaimed artists predominantly took the brand-new, clean and fresh L train; not only was the PA voice comput erized and clear, but convenient platform clocks provided the times of upcoming trains. Sure, the L trains travel through lower-income outskirts in Brooklyn, but was it just a coincidence that they were updated first? Likely the train line had more riders, which must be the case because the destinations were more popular. In the city, if the destinations are popular, then those who can pay more will have first dibs on living there, and I guess this means they get the better transportation service as well. The neighborhood divisions were most clearly shown on the night they temporarily disappeared. November 4th, 2008, Obama was elected. After his speech, everyone across the neighborhood spontaneously opened their windows and doors, came out of their homes, poured from the bars and restaurants and filled the streets. They sang the president-elect's name as if a giant chorus, a meditation on oneness, Om turned into "Ooobammma." People of all kinds, colors, shapes, complete strangers encountered each other, smiled, and joyously embraced. Drivers honked horns or pulled over and smoked cigarettes, laughing and crying. No one was in the wrong place. For one moment nothing mattered, but every one screamed and no one tried to parse out what each of those screams meant. Not then. They just screamed. Late that night, I watched scrawny white hipsters come upon a group of what would have been, to them, 155</page><page sequence="11">THE MASSACHUSETTS REVIEW menacing Puerto Rican teens and both parties clapped hands together, hollering the secret password, those three sacred syllables: Obama. I was part of similar scenes all along the main drags and side streets of Williamsburg. Looking back, I can recall a particular note sometimes present in the eyes of the young whites when confronted with their un known brown neighbors, a question that seemed to ask, "We can be friends now, right?" as if they were not responsible for any tension that existed prior to that moment, or as if somehow the election of a brown skinned man ameliorated for the uninvestigated entitlement and oblivi ousness over which the tension was made to tighten. The sense of one ness, of shared vision and celebration, washed over the neighborhood with the dramatic magnitude of a tsunami, but when it came time to start anew, rebuild from scratch, the invisible walls were filled in again with concrete and fear. While living in Williamsburg, I heard a few stories of white hipster types being robbed by their young brown neighbors. One was hospital ized by a pack of teenagers with a pool stick. The recounting of such attacks was often accompanied by implied questions:Why can't someone just walk home from a bar in peace? What did so-and-so [white] ever do to them [brown]? Why do I have to live in fear of being attacked in my own neighborhood? In his essay on Mailer, Baldwin wrote, "No one is more dangerous than he who imagines himself pure in heart: for his purity, by definition, is unassailable."18 In Williamsburg, I'm not sure how often it occurs to the pure-hearted young white person (myself, of course, included) to ask: What role do I play in reinforcing these external divisions and tensions? What is my responsibility? What fears do I have that create internal barriers to communicating freely? How do I bridge these gaps and relate across differences? What do I have to do? What kind of person am I going to be? This final question must be differentiated from the question of identity (i.e. who am I?). We might identify with any number of groups, things, people, words, attributes, and our identities might evolve and change, but in the end, we're all just human beings and we're all going to die. What kind of person is one going to be asks the question: How will I enact my humanity? What values will guide my actions? If we don't answer this ques tion for ourselves, if we try to overlook the importance of this question, then inevitably our actions will speak for us and what we hear might be detrimental to those people and things about which we thought we cared. So, maybe we think of ourselves as an artist, a Hindu, or Icelandic, 156</page><page sequence="12">Matt Ashby maybe we work as a librarian or a plumber, or consider ourselves gender queer, pansexual, hippie punk, whatever. Still, none of these identity markers answer the question: What kind of person am I going to be? IV. When i was seventeen years old, I had my first sexual interactions, including traditional intercourse. I'm careful, now, not to use the language of virginity lost, but I didn't feel that way back then. I still had a different take on virginity, but no less problematic. I didn't think of virginity as my preciousness incarnate, but I did consider it to be a unique, one-time means of communicating something I thought and felt was singular. In other words, I only wanted to share myself in particular ways with this one person, not because I was special, but because I knew it was a clear way to demonstrate to this person that she was utterly special. I saw sharing various virgin experiences as the way to prove my feelings were pure and true. I honestly felt this way. For three years, I acted under the auspices that she would be the only one with whom I would share these things. I was still under the same belief when the relationship ended. I couldn't see it at the time, but she let us go because she intuited some thing: we both had much more growing to do that neither of us could do together. In retrospect, although naive and insular, I still regard this as my first love relationship because it taught me what I believe is likely one of the primary qualities of love. Humans aren't perfect, as we know, and it is inevitable their relationships will also have many flaws. Love, to the best of my experience, is merely the relentless calling to learn from our mistakes, to do better for love. She and I always wanted to be better, to do better, and to love better; at one point, this meant letting go. Nevertheless, when we broke up, I was devastated. I had never before put all my faith and so much time into anything outside of myself, out side of those relationships that had seemingly always been integrated into my life. And I had never felt or called it love. I was reluctant to do so even as it was happening. It took a long time. I used to joke: we haven't even been together all four seasons, how do I know if I love her, what if we don't make sense in the spring? After it was over, I felt so many things, like she had betrayed me, didn't she realize I had believed we were for ever; then I felt like I had betrayed me, shouldn't I have waited until we were more mature to open my heart to those kinds of feelings? I felt used and exploited, first by her, then, when I realized that did no good, by me. 157</page><page sequence="13">THE MASSACHUSETTS REVIEW I had nothing left to offer. How would anyone ever again, as if there could even be a future, believe my love for them? Wasn't love completely singular? I could never participate in love again.That was it. My body was hollow and forsaken. I joked cynically: if I'm ever with another person, they might as well be the next person of a million. I was spent and mean ingless, and I believed all of my innocence and preciousness had been stripped away by the departure of love. It's easy to trivialize this kind of dramatic emotional response, but it was a pivotal point: I would either suffocate in despair by existing in a limbo space yearning for a lost love and preciousness that I believed had left me. Or I would need to let what I had thought of as "me" die in or der to live with these experiences as a new self. In necessarily following the second option, I had to take inventory and face myself. How could I learn to live with these experiences, and who would I be now, having lived them? And what of preciousness, what was this elusive quality I associated with the value I could offer to someone else? What was the connection between the sense of having been stripped of preciousness and the departure of a first love? My despair couldn't be solely attributed to our separation. There was more to the world than that, but why was I feeling as if everything had been taken away, like there was nothing left of me or for me? Other major events coincided with the breakup. A close friend had died only months earlier. Friends were dispersed to different colleges. I had relocated out of state to go to school and was living alone for the first time in my life. Our relationship ended amidst these transi tions, and it became the symbol for the death of a consciousness I had, at the time, loosely thought of as youth, but preciousness and innocence would work equally well. Preciousness, in the sense that I'm using the word, is the same as Baldwin's pure-heartedness. The preciousness I speak of presumes there was once a time I was wholly pure, as in before I had loved and lost. Furthermore, it presumes I once lived in a world where one could act completely freely without concern for consequence or responsibility. In deed, such a preciousness exists only for those living within the walls of a fabricated Eden, in the circumscribed suburbs of imagination, which was, for me, manifest in a relatively idyllic, white washed, American boyhood. In a finite world of limited resources, we are all tied together in space and time. If someone is born with more, then someone else will necessar ily be born with less, and the only way to justify such vast inequality and injustice is to collude with the lie that one was born special. In general, 158</page><page sequence="14">MattAshby white babies in the United States are born into this lie of exceptionalism; they are raised in a world that leads them to believe they were not born like every other human being and that one deserves one's advantage no matter the hidden costs to others. In order to sustain this lie, however, one must believe that, in one's individual case, death is unfair. But death is the great equalizer. We will all one day die. And death means that one does not have absolute freedom. One is confined by the limitations of one's body and one's humanness. One is limited by space and time, by con sciousness. This means that one is not born special, protected, nor wholly pure because one is no freer than the nearest prisoner, no safer than the victims of the most random cruelty, no more righteous than the smallest injustice; what realities exist in humankind exist equally for each human being at birth, believing otherwise is delusion, and death is the revelator. When my friend died, when my first love relationship ended, I was forced to respond to death unmistakably for the first time. Initially, I felt betrayed, as though she had lied to me, as though I had lied to me, and as though the world had lied to me. One can more quickly come to grips with the end of a life or the end of a love relationship than one can face the loss of what they had been led to believe was rightfully theirs, an unassailably pure, untrammeled heart, the ability to live and love freely without fear of love leaving, without fear of death.The real lie, of course, was that such an unassailably pure heart ever existed, for death is the fact of existence. There is no life before death. When someone holds tight to this invention of preciousness, one does so to avoid processing experience and dealing with death. In the faces and lifestyles of the so-called hipsters of Williamsburg, one can witness the desperation to retain such a self-deception. I recognize it clearly because I know the tendency in myself, and it is partly the source of my subcon scious sorrow. They reach into their imagination to re-create or retrieve what they believe was stolen from them, the right to love and be loved, perfect, pure-hearted, and free. They romanticize a time when there were no governments or states, no borders, no societal structures or cultural expectations, no language to confine or control what they believe would otherwise be our authentic, pure-hearted beings; nothing to impinge on freedom or complicate our consciousness; no history or experiences to keep us from relating freely; no death. They come to Williamsburg to immerse themselves in a very particular, exclusive environment among others who will support their creative self-deception. In effect, they can not give up the lie, they will not let go their belief in a world that never 159</page><page sequence="15">THE MASSACHUSETTS REVIEW truly existed, a world where they were safe, protected, pure, and free. The sort of preciousness that exonerates one from the implications of death, as Baldwin suggests, creates the gap between oneself and the reality of one's experiences, and our world as it is. My roommate, the painter, once imagined contemporary Williams burg as analogous to the Haight-Ashbury scene in San Francisco of the late 1960s. After he had said this, I discovered that one of the many build ing-side murals in the neighborhood depicted the corner street signs of Haight-Ashbury. Perhaps, as Lorentzen would have it, this was painted by some imitation hippie pining for the purportedly authentic love-fest of the flower children. In the last section of No Name in the Street, Baldwin makes observations about the Haight-Ashbury flower children that are remarkably applicable to the so-called hipsters of 2000 Williamsburg: For it seemed to have struck the flower children—I judged this from their conduct, from what seemed to be their blind and moving need to become organic, autonomous, loving and joyful creatures; their desire to connect love, joy and eroticism, so that all flowed together as one — that they were themselves the issue of a dirty joke, the dirty joke which has always been hidden at the heart of the legend of the Virgin birth.They were in the streets in the hope of becoming whole.19 Indeed, one cannot become whole or mature and still maintain a false sense of purity. I have had to learn and relearn this, letting my old selves die, in order to live with all of my ever-expanding experiences and all of myself, which may not be precious or perfect but it is my truth, and in that, I feel beauty. In the decade 2000, many young white professionals, self-proclaimed artists, and so-called hipsters came to live in Williamsburg because they felt a sense of solidarity with others in the neighborhood, aesthetic sensibility, artistic proclivity; they weren't just coming to share common interests, they were rejecting the attributes of their previous community, other parts of the city, other cities or towns, campuses, or households; they had rejected an upbringing in what they perceived as mainstream culture for something they perceived as alternative to that. Still, they had stopped their journeys at rejection, simply defaulting to permanent rejection mode. They had not shaken their sense of betrayal as evidenced by their 160</page><page sequence="16">Matt Ashby anxious attempt to create an impervious community unto itself, a world of freedom without consciousness or responsibility, where anything goes and everything is laughable and up for grabs. Though less overdy violent, they were descendants of Mailers hipster, living justifications for evasion. They flocked to Williamsburg out of fear, but it was not simply a post collegiate career frenzy or a post-9/11 sense of collective doom; this crisis starts at the individual core, and the response in the heart of hipster heaven has been a turning away from death, the death of one's perceived pure heartedness, the death of one's perceived preciousness. With their increasing concentrations, the so-called hipsters ofWil liamsburg demonstrate on a large scale something we all have to face at one point or another: one is either working for truth or lying to one self The truth is inexorable, and no matter how many delusional dreamers one hides amongst, one can't escape it or take breaks. One can preach love at all costs, but it takes a calling not a fashion. The night Obama won, we wanted to skip over the truth and get to the love the easy way. We wanted community without commitment. Even in the heart of a complex and diverse neighborhood, we have managed to keep ourselves mostly separated, closed-off, and oblivious.The reality is, at a given moment, any aging white so-called hipster or self-proclaimed artist could give up at rejection and join the culture from which we learned how to sustain a lie by rendering our neighbors invisible, a cul ture that has, to that point, been the foundation of everything we know as safe and comfortable, and perhaps, when we realize the world we have created is fundamentally not different than the one we left, many of us do give up. Superficial rebellion can be a form of avoidance; we cannot stop at rejection. The young white, professionals, self-proclaimed artists, and so-called hipsters ofWilliamsburg have "been born into a society in which nothing [is] harder to achieve, in which perhaps nothing [is] more scorned or feared than the idea of soul's maturity."20 But it is our only substantive hope to counter this fear with courage. We have to learn to live with fear, to let go completely and open ourselves to the unknown, the dark shapes into which we have painted our fears, the neighbors of all colors we have been taught to think of as foreigners to "our" world.To do so, we must also learn to live with every aspect of ourselves, even the terrifying, the painful, the ugly, the haunting, the ancient, the uncertain and uncontrollable. Until we learn to grow up, until we commit to this process of maturation, we will be disconnected and lost to ourselves, we will continue to alienate 161</page><page sequence="17">THE MASSACHUSETTS REVIEW those around us, we will continue to feel betrayed by everything we genu inely engage, and we will continue to feel hopelessly, irreversibly loveless.
