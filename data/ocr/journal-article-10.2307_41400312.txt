Modoc paternal They went ancestors about lived their near lives- the lava flats of northern California. They went about their lives- hunting, fishing, falling in love, mourning their dead- completely un- aware of an Atlantic Ocean, much less of any human beings on the other side of it. Meanwhile, Irish peasants- my mother's people- toiled in the rocky fields of the western county of Roscommon, spoke Gaelic, and worried when the next attack from the sea might come. Unschooled in geography, they possessed little notion of Spain, much less the possibility of a New World. Somewhere in the tree of my particular lineage were also French farmers, Swiss shepherds, German professors, Coeur d'Alene salmon fishermen- all innocent of the complications of contact, oblivious of each others' priorities and concerns, insular, ethnocentric, proud . . . and unfathomable to a contemporary person. These were men and women whose world was infinitely smaller, arguably easier, but ultimately less interesting than our own. When the lines of their consciousnesses inadvertently collided- well into the eight- eenth and nineteenth centuries- they were at least as confused as they were enlightened, as terrified by newness as they were fascinated by it. No doubt they mistrusted the strange, yearned for the security of the "old days," often wished each other gone. But there were also among them people who dared to look beyond the boundaries of their own birthplaces, who not only accepted but embraced the possibilities of dif- ference, who joined together to forge something new. This was not, in most cases, a matter of choice but rather a practical, * An earlier version of this essay was delivered with Louise Erdrich as part of a joint Charter Lecture/Reading at The University of Georgia on 7 April 1992. [407 ]</page><page sequence="2">4O8 THE GEORGIA REVIEW creative, and available necessity. Our dynamic American landscape of fabulously interwoven ethnicities has struggled for generations to devise a workable definition of itself- a challenge and debate at the heart of the quincentennial anniversary of Christopher Columbus' first voyage to this hemisphere. The task has consistently proven to be neither simple nor uncontroversial. "Multiculturalism," though the only catchall that ac- curately reflects this nation's history of free-for-all migration and slip- pery assimilation, has become almost a cliché in political discourse- a bow to each federally recognized ethnic population, a dutiful list of its ac- complishments and contributions to the modern world. As a concept, multiculturalism is amorphism without the sharp edges that traditionally mark boundaries, and it rarely pleases anyone. Among the Native American people I know and respect, there are many who are angry at the attention lavished on the 1992 continental birthday party. These individuals are the embittered descendants of tribes whose lands were stolen, whose populations were decimated, whose re- ligions were outlawed and held in contempt, whose books were burned, whose skin color was reviled. They have ample reason to profess an aversion to Columbus and all he stands for. Mythologizing and glorifying -or denigrating- a complicated past does no justice to anyone. It over- simplifies, and it buries hard facts and sad realities. It absolves without any confession of guilt, and it does not heal. There are, among my non-Indian friends, those who resent any cloud cast over the international orgy of self-aggrandizement, and who blissfully dismiss as "revisionary" every history save that of the con- querors. "To the victors belong the spoils," they crow. But they are wrong- wrong as the extollers of Manifest Destiny were in the last cen- tury, wrong as those who would remake the world in the image of a single culture or society or faith- and they must be challenged. Our di- versity, as a species, has always been our salvation. Why do we struggle so to deny and suppress it? * Who, after all, were those societies that greeted Europeans five, four, three hundred years ago? What were their motives, their important ele- ments, their contrasts with the Old World norms that attempted to dominate and destroy them? Imagine the scene: it is an autumn day in the late fifteenth century. On a beach with rose-colored sand, somewhere in the Caribbean, two</page><page sequence="3">MICHAEL DORRIS 409 groups of people are about to meet for the first time. The world will never again be the same. Emerging from a small landing boat are a group of men exhausted from a long and frightening ocean voyage. They didn't trust where they were going and now they don't know where they've arrived- but it doesn't look at all like the India described by Marco Polo. They come from Spain and Portugal and Genoa, are Christian and Jewish. The more superstitious and uneducated among them feared that, by sailing west across the Atlantic, they would fall off the edge of the planet. The men seek treasure and adventure, fame and glory, but the people who greet them seem quite poor. They are not dressed in fine brocade encrusted with precious jewels, as one would expect of subjects of the great Khan. They are, in fact, not dressed at all, except for a few woven skirts and dabs of paint. Are they demons? Are they dangerous? Do they know where the gold is hidden? Watching the boat draw near are a cluster of men, women, and children. They speak a dialect of the Arawak language and are de- lighted to receive new guests, especially ones who aren't painted white- signifying death. Strangers arrive often, anxious to barter parrot feathers or new foods or useful objects made of stone or shell. These particular visitors look rather strange, it's true: their bodies are covered with odd materials, not at all suited for the warm climate, and they communicate with each other in a tongue as indecipherable as Carib or Nahuatl. Up close there are more surprises. There are no women in the group, and some among the hosts speculate on why this may be the case. Have their clan mothers expelled these men, banished them to wander alone and orphaned? Has their tribe suffered some disaster? And another thing: they have the strong odor of people who have not had their daily bath. Are they from some simple and rude society that doesn't know how to comport itself? But all this notwithstanding, guests are guests and should be treated with hospitality. They must be offered food and shelter, must be enter- tained with stories and music, before the serious business of trade begins. * The earth was much larger than Christopher Columbus imagined, and its human population was far more diverse. The land mass he encountered on his transatlantic voyages was thoroughly inhabited by more than one hundred million people, from the frigid steppes of Patagonia at the fur-</page><page sequence="4">410 THE GEORGIA REVIEW thest extremity of South America to the dark arboreal forests of New- foundland. In the inhospitable Arctic, Inuits foraged for much of the year in small nuclear or extended family groups, assembling only spo- radically to carry on the necessary business of marriage, remembrance, or collective action, and only when the availability of food was at its peak. In the lush and verdant jungles of Yucatán and Guatemala, Mayas had invented agriculture, writing, and an accurate calendar fifteen hundred years before the birth of Christ, and they had gone on to become popu- lous in complex, class-oriented societies supported by a nutritionally balanced diet based on maize, squashes, and beans. In the Andes of north- western South America, early Quechuas domesticated the potato, engi- neered an intricate system of roads and bridges, formed a nation in which the state owned all property except houses and movable household goods, and collected taxes in labor. The Western Hemisphere was home to literally hundreds of cul- tures whose people spoke a multiplicity of languages and dialects derived from at least ten mutually exclusive linguistic families. Many societies had well-developed traditions of science and medicine- some forty per- cent of the modern world's pharmacopeia were utilized in America be- fore 1492- and literature, visual art, and philosophy flourished in a variety of contexts. Yet beyond a shared geography, there were few common denominators; due to the haphazard and long process by which in-migrat- ing peoples had distributed themselves throughout the continents, the Western Hemisphere thrived as a living laboratory of disparate life- styles, linguistic variety, and cultural pluralism. The Karok in California were no more likely to share mores with the Anishinabe of Wisconsin or the Yanomamo of Venezuela than they were with groups in Polynesia or Persia. Every type of social organiza- tion existed: theocracies among the Natchez, matrilineal clan descent among the Delaware, incipient forms of representative government among the Iroquois, chiefdoms among the Arawak, confederacies among the Huron, loosely knit bands among the peoples of the Amazon. The Zunis maintained stable towns and the Toltecs dwelled in cosmopolitan cities. Vast trading networks linked the so-called Mound Builders of central North America with the tribes living along the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, as well as with peoples on the North Atlantic seaboard. Obviously, no single group was directly aware of more than a frac- tion of the other extant societies- and there was no conception of an overarching group identity. "We" was the family, the community, the</page><page sequence="5">MICHAEL DORRIS 4I I tribe, and "they" were everyone else, known and unknown. The fact of cultural diversity, however, was manifest. Within a day's walk of vir- tually every indigenous population could be found at least one and prob- ably more than one unrelated community whose inhabitants, relative to the visitor, spoke a totally foreign and incomprehensible language, ad- hered to a unique cosmology, dressed in unusual clothing, ate exotic foods, and had a dissimilar political organization with peculiar variations on age and gender roles. Native persons in most regions of precontact America could and undoubtedly did believe that they belonged to the smartest, most taste- ful, most accomplished, and most handsome human constellation in the universe, but clearly they knew that their particular culture was not the only one. Variety, in whichever way it was construed and explained, was inescapably the human norm. It is little wonder, therefore, that for Europeans of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, America proved to be much more than a single new world: it was an unimagined universe. The sheer heterogeneity of West- ern Hemisphere societies challenged every cherished medieval assumption about the uniform and orderly nature of human origin and destiny. It was as if the cultural hodgepodge of America revealed a whole new set of potential operating rules- or, even more disconcerting, served as an ego- threatening intimation that there were no dependable rules at all. Imagine the shock! To have believed for a thousand years that everything and everybody of consequence was known and neatly categorized, and then suddenly to open a window and learn that, all along, one had been dwell- ing in a small house with no perspective on the teeming and chaotic city that surrounded one's accustomed neighborhood- with no map or dic- tionary provided. How did Cain and Abel fit into this new, complicated schema? Which Old Testament patriarch begat the Lakota or the Chib- cha? How did the Comanche get from the Tower of Babel to Oklahoma? The contrasts between the Old World and the Americas were stag- gering. With only a few minor exceptions, virtually all Europeans spoke languages that sprang from a single linguistic family. Moreover, in the larger perspective, Europe's vaunted religious and philosophical divisions were basically variations on a concordant theme. Everyone from the Bal- tic to the Balkans and on west to the British Isles professed belief in the same male divinity, and- except for European Jewry- worshiped His Son as well. As side effects of this theological unity, Latin became a lingua franca</page><page sequence="6">412 THE GEORGIA REVIEW for intellectuals from all sectors, and the Mosaic code formed the basis for practically every ethical or legal philosophy. The broad assumption of male dominance reigned uncontested, from individual marriage contracts to the leadership hierarchy of emergent nation-states. And the Bible- especially the Book of Genesis- was regarded as a literally true and fac- tually accurate accounting of origin itself. Significantly, in the Adam and Eve story creation is intentional-, a personalized, anthropomorphic, male divinity formed a man in His image and then threw in a woman, made out of a nonessential rib, for man's company and pleasure. God's word was law, and the only token com- petition came from a fallen angel, also of His manufacture. After devising, in six days, a universe whose primary purpose was to exist as a backdrop and amusement park for man, the Divinity set up a test for the objects of His invention- a test the Divinity, being omniscient as well as omnip- otent, must have known all along that they would fail. They did. A nonbeliever attempting to analyze this saga might well find parts of it, while interesting, downright bizarre. Why were men and women so disproportionately blessed? Why did God go to all the trouble? For all its paradox, however, the Genesis story did fulfill a function for the Hebraic people to whom it was initially addressed. It authenticated divine sponsorship for the law of the land and proffered an explanation, so neces- sary for a poor, threatened minority population: that life was supposed to be pain, that humankind deserved what it got, and that the only true happiness and peace would come to the just after death. The many creation stories Native Americans have believed about themselves- whether of emergence myths or earth-diver tales, of divine births or great floods- are every bit as pregnant with particular meaning for their specific audiences as was Genesis for the Israelites. Take, for example, a Trickster tale found in several Northwest Coast tribal ver- sions: according to legend, one day Raven, the androgynous culture hero/ Trickster, spies a bush containing a new kind of berry: purple and lus- cious, bursting with sweet juice. The Trickster can't resist and begins to gobble them up, not stopping until every one is consumed. Breast feathers stained and belly bloated, Raven staggers to the side of a cliff, spreads his/her wings, and careens off into the air. Suddenly Raven is seized by terrible stomach cramps and imme- diately experiences the worst case of diarrhea in the history of the world. It's terrible: everywhere Raven flies droppings land, until finally the pain</page><page sequence="7">MICHAEL DORRIS 41 3 subsides, and with a sigh of relief Raven looks down at the earth to see the mess he/she has made. And there we are, come to life: human beings! Raven beheld these ridiculous creatures, made out of excrement, and laughed. And the ridiculous creatures squinted up at Raven- and laughed back! A society with this irreverent anecdote in its repertoire has a very different self -concept than one with solemn Genesis as its primary refer- ent. The Raven tale is supposed to be funny, is aimed to entertain and thus be memorable. Creation itself, the story implies, was a totally random act- a fluke. Additionally, the first encounter between creator and createe is maddening for both. Theirs is a relationship without mutual culpability, without guilt, affection, or even clear purpose. As a matter of fact, sub- sequent chapters in the cycle demonstrate that the joking relationship between Raven and humanity persists and becomes even more perverse over time. The universe based on such stories was conceived in large part as irrational, not a product of cause and effect, stimulus and response. Events occurred without great purpose and had to be dealt with on their own terms- pragmatically and intelligently. A plague of locusts, an earth- quake, or some other misfortune did not take place because an individual or a people failed to satisfy a demanding and ambiguous Zeus or Jupiter or Jehovah; instead such phenomena were regarded as periodic disrup- tions in the inevitable course of existence. Fatalism and humor, as opposed to responsibility and recrimination, were the appropriate attitudes toward misfortune. The gods, like everything else, were inscrutable. Harmony, in human communities or in nature as a whole, was best preserved through balance and established custom, and both people and divinities were but ingredients in a grand, interrelated panorama which encompassed all things. Practically speaking, prior to the so-called "Age of Discovery" Europeans had little contact with populations substantively dissimilar to themselves- certainly not in a sufficient quotient to shake their entrenched ethnocentrism. Relations with central or east Asia, or with sub-Saharan Africa, were rare, and usually filtered through the Islamic societies oc- cupying the southern and eastern perimeters of the Mediterranean. Al- though Arabs were regarded in certain respects as exotic and the polar opposite of Christians, they were, nevertheless, comprehensible; generally similar in terms of skin pigmentation, patriarchal orientation, and even religious derivation, they were appositives whose customs fell within the</page><page sequence="8">414 THE GEORGIA REVIEW range of at least plausible behavior. They were ideal "heathens" because they tended to embrace skewed versions of the values revered by Euro- peans: messianic and orthodox monotheism, territorial conquest, the ac- cumulation of material wealth. In so doing, they provided a neat and precise contrast that, point by point, helped both groups define them- selves (i.e., "this," not "that"). Throughout the Middle Ages, Euro- peans regarded rumored tales of a world beyond Granada or Cairo or Damascus, even those authored by Herodotus and Pliny, as odd to the point of science fiction and largely irrelevant to the daily lives of ordinary people. This reassuring order suffered a severe blow when the first boatloads of Spanish and Portuguese sailors ventured far to the south and east but failed to topple off the edge of the world- pinpointed, predictably, just beyond the sight of Christendom's western shore. Verifying the immen- sity of Africa and the Orient, each bursting with undeniably non-Euro- pean peoples and cultures, was traumatic enough news, but not altogether a surprise. Alexander, after all, had been to India, and the overland spice route to Cathay was well-worn. But with the dramatic appearance of the Western Hemisphere, the dazzling implications of global heterogeneity could no longer be avoided. The argument for the centrality of Europe, if the concept were to remain intact, was forced to alter its traditional rationalizations in order to account for all else that turned out to exist on the rest of the planet. The initial solution, analogous to the ostrich that sticks its head into the sand at the first sign of trouble, was abject denial. If new data didn't fit into old explanations, then it couldvit be accurate. Later, as the diversity of humanity became increasingly manifest, the working definition of "true human being" became more and more rigid, more and more narrow, and long theological debates took place on such esoterica as whether or not natives of America or Australia even had souls. This condescending approach was hard to maintain in the face of the intelligence and industry evident in the cities, plus the bountiful agri- culture, science, art, and, especially, wealth reported by conquistadors like Cortes and Pizarro. Indeed, the empire civilizations of Meso- and Latin America- those of the Aztec and Inca, specifically- were probably easiest for Europeans to swallow. Though the customs varied and the official religions were strange to the early Spanish explorers, at least the motivating goals were recognizable: a thirst for conquest, the accumula- tion of gold, a consolidation of political power in the hands of a single</page><page sequence="9">MICHAEL DORRIS 415 leader and his coterie. The larger nation-states must have been reminiscent of Moorish analogs, with their swarthy populations, exploitable treasures, and grand cities. Their wealth was obvious and marketable, their existing labor force already organized and ready to be co-opted, and their uni- versal religions familiar in the challenges they posed for Christian con- version. Smaller, tribally based cultures of North America, on the other hand, must have struck Europeans as other-worldly upon first encounter. By and large these groups maintained no standing armies, practiced a mind-boggling variety of inordinately flexible religions, and were non- literate; they were also vague regarding the precise boundaries of their territory, very often passing property and authority through a female line of descent. Few North American societies sought to impose ideology on neighboring cultures, insisting instead that the freedom of the indi- vidual predominated over the power of the state. Leadership tended to spring from expertise or proven ability rather than from dynastic hered- ity, and in any given society there might exist a multiplicity of "chiefs"- each a specialist in a limited arena of group life, none supreme over all the others. Furthermore, most native North American peoples considered land to be an abstract commodity similar in kind to air or water or fire- something necessary for human survival but above personal ownership. While the notion of a group or a person's rights to use a certain piece of property was widespread, there was almost no corresponding idea of "title" or of land owned exclusively and permanently by those who didn't directly work it. Concepts of accumulation varied widely, from those that held all nonpersonal items in common, to Northwest Coast "potlatch" societies like the Kwakiutl and Nootka where family status depended on formal giveaways of property- to the point of temporary impoverishment. Armed conflict could occur between tribes, parts of tribes, or indi- viduals for a variety of reasons, but usually the hostilities lasted no longer than a single season or encounter, and loss of life was minimal. As a rule, there was no insistence upon "total victory" or the complete an- nihilation of an enemy. Battles were fought for personal reasons- revenge, honor, or greed- and once these limited objectives had been achieved, the reason for a prolonged hostile action no longer existed. Last year's an- tagonists might be next year's hunting partners. As competition with European invaders became increasingly intense,</page><page sequence="10">41 6 THE GEORGIA REVIEW few indigenous societies mounted effective resistance, and those that did were soon vanquished. Not only had most Native American cultures by and large failed to invent effective weaponry or support standing military forces, but they were almost immediately devastated by an unseen foe that, according to some demographers, wiped out ninety-five percent of the precontact population. A pandemic of diseases which had long ex- isted in the "old world" but never previously in the "new"- influenza, smallpox, measles, tuberculosis, and cholera prime among them- were inadvertently carried to the Western Hemisphere by the first European visitors, and in a matter of several generations the virulent bacteria spread from one indigenous population to the next. Often by the time the first Spanish or British traders or settlers arrived in the interior of the con- tinents, most Indians were aready dead, the straggling survivors trauma- tized and in despair. These lands, which in their naïveté some European chroniclers called "empty," had only recently been depleted of their native inhabitants. Early European explorers in America, continually confronted with the unexpected, soon began to seek the miraculous in their journeys. They sent home reports of the Seven Golden Cities of Cibola, of fountains whose waters restored eternal youth, of warrior queens who rode upon giant armadillos. Feudal kinds of agricultural societies, like those of the Cherokee or Creek, were labeled "civilized," while those whose dress, customs, and lifestyles seemed most foreign were termed "savage." In fact, they were simply "different" parts of the mosaic of human possibility and potential- the laboratory of cultural experiment- that characterized the America of 1491. Collectively, its societies left tremen- dous legacies to the contemporary world, from cultivated crops (corn, beans, squash, tomatoes, potatoes, manioc) to political structures (models of representative government, gender equality) and philosophical ap- proaches toward environmental conservation and peaceful coexistence. Many of the ideas and ideals first developed among its native peoples remain viable, sane options for a world that grows, through technology, increasingly small, increasingly homogenous. Diversity, that multifaceted reflection of human ingenuity, has come under suspicion just when it is clear that our stripped and exhausted planet needs it most. As contemporary Americans, we need to acknowledge once again our multiculturalism, using the occasion of the Columbus quincentenary to examine and celebrate, to criticize and revise, and- more than anything eke- to learn from the process of that ongoing union. We must seek the</page><page sequence="11">MICHAEL DORRIS 417 truth and, through the illumination of that verity, avoid the mistakes and blindnesses of our respective forbears. We should commemorate, sing kaddish, communicate, hope. As the unlikely survivors of an inexorable process beyond any of our controls, we should not be surprised to feel an odd mixture of shame and pride, relief and regret. We need also remem- ber, however, that like the chain of dancers on the beach at the end of Federico Fellini's 8V2, we are potentially- in our thoughtfulness, our will- ingness to listen to each other, our curiosity, and our mutual compassion -the world's last chance for a better and more harmonious future.</page></plain_text>
