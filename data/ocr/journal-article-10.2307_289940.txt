The assignment of the lines as given in the Teubner and Oxford editions is reviewed, and a reassignment suggested.] In the Teubner and Oxford editions of Aristophanes' Vespae, verses 818-823 read as follows: 818 i. ev 7r To0), Ta ' A ' ape' att /otL.

Citations in parentheses are lacking in the Ravenna manuscript. Here the scholiast is conjecturing, but his conjectures have been followed by all editors who, whatever they may do with the text and assignment of lines, annotate with the equivalent of van Leeuwen's stage direction inserted before v. 820, "tabulam pictam exhibens, in qua cernitur sacellum lupi simulacrum con- tinens." Van Leeuwen's further description of the picture will be treated below. These lines lead up to the joke in vv. 822 f. This joke must not be obvious before it is released to the audience, but its full force must not be in doubt when that time comes. Otherwise it would fall flat. Further, it is the climax to a series of ridicu- lous stage properties brought by Bdelycleon for the purpose of making the miniature court all that his father could wish. Hence it must have not merely all the ridiculous point of the preceding properties, but more too. To introduce a 7rtvaKLov would lose all this. Even a large riva4 (to say nothing of a little one) would be hard to see in detail from farther off than 362</page><page sequence="2">PROBLEMS IN ARISTOPHANES' "VESPAE ' " 818-823. 363 the first few rows; yet there is reference in vv. 821 ff. to the details of the exhibit. And the writer believes that even if Ws XaX7ro i&amp;Zlv could be understood as referring at all to the diffi- culty of seeing the figure of Lycus and distinguishing its features, the words certainly have the more extended meaning of "how terrible you are to look upon" (so Richter, Green, Graves, Rogers, Starkie), with especial reference to Lycus' savage attitude toward suppliants; cf. w. 389 f. Indeed, if the audience is to see the point of the jest on Cleonymus immedi- ately and easily, the representation of him must be clearly visible to all, and the first meaning of au XaXErS ro Kr. is excluded. Likewise is excluded the possibility of a 7rtlVKtov. If one abandons the idea of a small tablet as the representa- tion of Lycus, the question arises as to what the real object produced was. A brief examination of the other legal properties will assist in this. Vv. 767 if. deal with the advantages of judging in one's own home. Philocleon having been won over, Bdelycleon enters the house at v. 798 to return at v. 805 bring- ing the paraphernalia and exclaiming triumphantly " i8ov, Ti -T' ~pels; Here I'm bringing you everything I said, and lots more besides." The first item is the adg1, with which Philocleon is well satisfied. V. 811, Kal 7rvp ye TrovrtL Kal T7rpoEorrTT/cKv faK? po eiv. This also is an unexpected satisfaction. In v. 815 the cock is first mentioned, whose purpose is to keep the old man awake, as is immediately explained. Thereupon follows the Lycus-property under discussion. This last stands as a climax to the series. Aristophanes recog- nizes that the series of three which precedes has its own climax within itself, i. e. the cock. These objects are brought out together at one time through the consideration of Bdelycleon. For the fourth item another introduction is necessary; this is furnished by Philocleon's request. And skilfully the poet makes this seem like a super-climax by starting the legal proceedings immediately afterward with a change of subject at v. 824. At this point the audience is not aware of the further climaxes to follow whenever the court is interrupted by the further need of properties, e.g. v. 829. These further properties are 1) the bar of justice, for which a pig-sty is substituted, 2) the voting urns, for which soup-ladles are used, and 3) the clepsydra, which is supplied by the a&amp;ut. The first series of three articles has</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. nothing to do with legal procedure, but are all comic illustra- tions of Bdelycleon's foresight in providing non-essential luxur- ies; the last series of three objects is composed of household substitutes for genuine legal properties, and it is in this sub- stitution that the humor of the situation lies. Between these two series, and so to speak in a class by itself, is the Lycus-icon, whatever its nature may have been. We cannot dogmatically say that this division into series of homogeneous nature was conscious art on Aristophanes' part, but certainly the fact is plain enough. In casting about for the Lycus heroin, then, we must find 1) a substitute that has some other well-recognized function, 2) one that will make the unskilful laugh and appeal to the groundlings, 3) one of such a size that its characteristics will be readily apparent to all the audience, 4) one that can be described as XaAeros t&amp;;v, 5) that will lack o'rAXa, and 6) that will satisfy the old man, either in truth or by the casuistry that is permitted the writer of comedy. The actual appearance of Lycus is doubtful, aside from his wolfish form (cf. references by Gunning in P-W Realenc. s. v. 20). No representation of him is cited by Gunning nor in Roscher's Lexicon. In this connection the meanings of both XaXAro' and 7rXAa must be defined if possible; and in dealing with the question in its larger aspects we must remember that the primary object of Attic Old Comedy was the laughter of the audience, to achieve which any absurdity, any tampering with reality, any exaggera- tion, and any lapse into pure farce was readily admissible. The meanings suggested by the commentators for XaAe7roJ' may be resolved into various shadings of "ugly," "difficult," and "savage." The scholiast inclines to the first of these, but on the premise that the object displayed was a 7rtvctov. Very naturally he makes what may be a mistake in conceiving of Cleonymus as appvOzuos, for there is no evidence that Cleonymus was ugly aside from what is implied in Ach. 88 (with schol.) and other passages of like purport, for which see Holden, Onomasticon Aristoph. s. v. KAeZvV,oAs. Large he certainly was, as plenty of evidence from Aristophanes shows, and presumably gluttonous as well, but there is no direct evidence for physical deformity or positive ugliness in Cleonymus except from the scholiast, whose inferences seem drawn from the text. Indeed, 364</page><page sequence="4">PROBLEMS IN ARISTOPHANES' "(VESPAE" 818-823. 365 it would not be impossible to postulate from Av. 1476 f. that the "phenomenal tree" was a handsome and strapping fellow, though utterly useless. But this interpretation must not be pushed. The translation of aXe7ro' as " difficult" also rests upon the assumption of a 7rrvcaov. Enough has already been said to rule this out of the question. There remains "savage." For this meaning, frequent in Thucydides and Plato, cf. also Aristoph. Lys. 1116, and espe- cially Vesp. 942, 7raVEL xaaXEros Wv xal 8vwKoAos. It is xaAcronms that Philocleon admires in a dicast, it is attested for Lycus in Vesp. 389 ff., it may easily be postulated (in the springtime) for Cleonymus besides, in his dealings with the foreigners (Av. 1478 f., with schol.). Philocleon seems quite sincere in his admiration of the substitute Lycus (Rogers ad loc.), and all things considered, an interpretation of XaXers as "savage" seems most consistent with probabilities.- This does not remove the point from the following comparison of the object to Cleony- mus the pAIawrrnt. V. 822 is left in such a form that one is uncertain whether it is assent or denial, i. e. "Yes, he looks like Cleonymus" or " He looks more like Cleonymus to me," with v. 823 added as explanation. The present writer inclines toward the latter feeling, in spite of the omission of WAXX, ye or some other adversative word. Secondly, we must treat the interpretation of. 07rXa, which, standing in the emphatic position in the verse, carries ,rapa 7rpOSoKt'av the weight of the jest. One must not be afraid of an interpretation of Aristophanes in malam partem; the less con- formable to modern taste it be, the more likely it is to be correct. The object standing for Lycus may well be ao-rXos in a different sense from Cleonymus 6 p1'aoarws. On this meaning of ArXov, see Ach. 592 (eoorXAos, neglected by the lexicons, scholiast and com- mentators in general), Hesych., A. Plan. 242, Athenaeus 683 E citing Nicander, and the idiomatic usages of other languages. This is a strongly attractive possibility, but must be balanced against the possibility of a literal interpretation with no pun intended. Regarding the latter there is a question whether strictly 7rXa would be used in connection with a klVarTL. One would expect o7rAa in the plural to connote more than merely a shield, and yet Cleonymus is called pl'aatcS instead of ptoirAXos. "'Orov specifically i= the large shield, but orXaa = arms in gen-</page><page sequence="5">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. eral, offensive as well as defensive. The origin of P?Saorrs is obscure; it is cited as first appearing in Aristophanes, and in that case was coined by the poet for the sole purpose of describ- ing Cleonymus, which Pollux viii. 40 also seems to imply (although Plato Legg. 944 B uses it as nearly synonymous with airo8oXev 07rX,w). It would be intolerable pedantry to hold Aristophanes to strict and logical accuracy in the details of Cleonymus' marital exploits, and yet the use of o7XAa may open the way to the pun referred to, whereas the more limited o5rXov or faTriSa might have eliminated it by restricting the poet against his wishes to the more circumscribed sense of defensive armor. Yet another point to be considered is the correct attributioa of the lines. The MSS give vv. 821 f. to Philocleon and v. 823 to Sosias. This arrangement is followed by Brunck (1783), Bekker (1829), Dindorf (1835), Mitchell (1835), Richter (1858), Poyard (1860). The present accepted assignment of v. 821 to Philocleon, v. 822 to Bdelycleon, v. 823 to Philocleon seems to have originated with Holden (1848), although Richter (proleg. ad Vespas, p. 46) credits it to Bergk (1851 ?1 and 1857). This is followed by Rogers (1875), Graves (1894), Starkie (1897) and Hall-Geldart (1906). Van Leeuwen assigns v. 821 to Philocleon and vv. 822 f. to Sosias. Siiss, diss. De persona- rum antiquae comoediae Atticae usu atque origine, 1905, p. 70, attributes v. 823 to Xanthias, since that slave has already in- dulged in fwoJoAoxta at vv. 500 ff. He says (p. 71) "In codici- bus videmnus saepius vel eos, quos certis nominibus notavit poita, servos simpliciter significari loeo notationis personarum Oepa- 7rovras vel ot'KcEra. Hoc ex usu fluxisse videtur confusio nostri loci." If this be so, then v. 823 might be equally well attributed to either slave, and the same with the slave's speeches in vv. 835 ff. From v. 815 (e&amp;reyare) it is apparent that Bdelycleon is assisted in bearing the properties from the house, and the same may be inferred from v. 822 (,iiv). But why change tha MS attribution of v. 823, with Siiss? Further, there is no reason for accepting the change proposed by Holden (or Bergk) to balance the distribution of parts; it is entirely out of char- acter for Philocleon to indulge at v. 823 in the only buffoonery in this scene; the MSS give v. 823 to Sosias; p3owooXia is en- tirely proper for him; and the writer is strongly inclined to 1 The writer has not had access to this first edition by Bergk. 366</page><page sequence="6">PROBLEMS IN ARISTOPHANES' " VESPAE" 818-823. 367 follow the MSS and earlier editors. Van Leeuwen and the Oxford editors give vv. 835, 836-838, 841-842, 843 to Sosias without apparent reason, against the editorial and Aldine tradi- tion (" OI. libri (ut videtur)"-Blaydes. Cod. Ven. shows a symbol resembling an inverted figure-4, with E suprascript.) But the sudden and violent entrance at v. 835 seems more like the appearance of a character long off the stage than of one that has just retired eleven lines before. Hence the writer feels that Xanthias should retain these lines, or in any case that the speaker of them should not be the same as the speaker of v. 823. If that speaker be Sosias, then let Xanthias retain the part in vv. 835 ff., or vice versa. But the fact that Xanthias has been buffoon at v. 500 does not exclude his co-slave from the same part at v. 823. A more radical alteration is proposed in giving v. 822 to the same speaker as v. 823. The two seem connected in thought in a way unrecognized by any editor except van Leeuwen, who gives them both to Sosias. The hit at Cleonymus and the joke which explains the hit should naturally proceed from the same person. If either line must be given to Sosias, then the other follows, and similarly with Bdelycleon. But Sosias seems more logical, provided one does not follow van Leeuwen in the attribution of vv. 835 ff. One further point in van Leeuwen's text deserves comment. He divides v. 822 KXe.v.... v,uos, and is followed by Gunning in P-W Realenc. s. v. Lykos (col. 2398, 1. 44). This is ingeni- ous, but places too great a load on the joke. Cleonymus himself was an adequate object of ridicule, and no arriere pensee was necessary as excuse for his introduction. We have, then, discarded the scholiast's 7rvaKxtov showing a likeness of Lycus, we have defined the qualifications necessary for the object really submitted, we have canvassed the possible meanings of XaXeros' and oXAa as applied to it, and have assigned v. 822 f. to the same speaker, different from the speaker of v. 835, and more probably Sosias than either Xanthias or Bdely- cleon. It remains to attempt to discover the nature of the object submitted in place of Lycus. There is no reason to suppose that it was brought from the house at the same time as the properties already delivered. On the contrary, if it had been, Bdelycleon would presumably have turned it over without waiting to be asked for it. If it was not</page><page sequence="7">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. brought at first from the house, Bdelycleon either entered to fetch it between vv. 819 and 820 or else he cast his eye around the scene for the quickest substitute he could find. &amp;KKOu'TOA (v. 819) implies that Philocleon expects him to go inside to bring it; 7rappwL rovr, Kavro S ava4 ovrroT (v. 820) implies that this was unnecessary, and this is further implied by Bdelycleon's quick answer, leaving Philocleon no time for a soliloquy corre- sponding to vv. 799-804. Now if the object was not brought from the house at all, but was on the stage the entire time, one cannot but think of the herm usual outside Athenian houses, standing in the vestibule, in much the same local relation to the dwelling as Lycus occupied to the law-court. Turning now to v. 875, we find Apollo Agyieus addressed , Sgcroror ava4, yeLrov ayvtcv roL ov 7rp tpoaerv 7rpo7rvXalov (or 7rpoOvpov 7rpo7rvAaLe),2 an obvious apostrophe to some figure before the door. On Agyieus in general his functions and forms, cf. Reisch in P-W Realenc. s. v. Agyieus, and the references there collected. He had one principal form which is constantly referred to as "a column sharpened to a point" (Ktow et O$v XArywv), but he was also shown simply as an altar (cf. Harpoc. s. v. ayvuip for both of these), and as anthropomorphic (Paus. ii. 19.8 at Argos, viii. 53. 6 at Tegea, and probably i. 31. 6 at Acharnae). But of more particular interest are references to Agyieus in herm-form; these deserve fuller treatment for the present purpose.

The same figure could unquestionably serve as both Apollo Agyieus and Hermes, as occasion demanded, and the suggestion is here put forward that the object submitted at v. 820 was 1) a herm in form, 2) used as Apollo Agyieus at v. 875, 3) admitted as Lycus in v. 821, and 4) had similarities to Cleonymus in vv. 822 f. A herm has far more comic possibilities than a stone cone. Both are aorAXoL in at least a military sense, but a grotesque herm designed under proper inspiration could, apart from its other advantages, be far more XaXA7ro&amp; than the conventional Agyieus. Such a property would be standing unnoticed in its usual place; its only effect before v. 820 would be to whet the audience's expectation as to what that thing was for; and having served its purpose in v. 820, it would again be turned to comic account at v. 875. The effect of delivering a serious prayer before a caricatured herm, accompanying it with appropriate gestures and intonation, is obviously ludicrous, and the achievement of the ludicrous has already been mentioned as the primary aim of Attic Old Comedy. The make-up of the herm was entirely at the whim of the poet and his company. We know enough of the character of Cleonymus to feel sure that he was shown as a glutton. If there were external characteristics whereby sycophants were recognized, they also figured. The inevitable allusion to his having cast his shield implies the biological pun. His face, if human, was adequately XaAE7ros. Nothing could better fit the necessities when Bdelycteon was suddenly called upon to supply a "p?ov of Lycus. If the main outlines of the foregoing be accepted, one final detail of stage business is postulated by vv. 819 f. Philocleon asks for a Op6ov, i. e. hero's shrine. In v. 821 the Opwov is con- tinued as the subject of 7rapecrn, followed by Kav'ro alvcO ovroL. Thus the shrine and "the king" seem to be two distinct ele- ments. Now we have a meagre hint as to the furnishings of a Lycus herobn in v. 394. The reed mats there mentioned could be convincingly and easily parodied by kicking some straw or tossing a couple of cushions-anything that lay most convenient -at the base of the herm to accompany the first words of v. 821. A demonstrative gesture explained the latter part. "Here's the shrine right here, and this is the king himself! " H. COMFORT. PRINCETON UNIVERBITY.</page></plain_text>
