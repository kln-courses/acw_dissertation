ISBN: 978-0-521-86066-6. doi: l.10 1 7/S0009840X08000176 This excellent book looks at animal choruses in connection with the origins of comedy. It analyses as evidence vase paintings, comic fragments, and complete plays by Aristophanes. R. argues that even though animal choruses may have originated in cult, they also have other sources. In particular they are strongly connected with the symposium, which R. views as an exclusively aristocratic institution. He argues that the authors of late fifth-century comedy purposely took up the old tradition of animal masquerades, presenting animal choruses on stage. The animals in these choruses are social animals which can co-exist with human culture. Chapters 1 and 2 ask whether animal choruses have ritual origins. R. uses sixth and early fifth-century, i.e. pre-comic, vase paintings of non-animal and animal performances as evidence and discusses different venues of performance (including symposium, k6mos and animal masquerades) and pre-comic choruses (including padded and phallic dancers, non-phallic dancers in costumes, and satyrs). The animals in performances or k6moi treated in this book are horses, bulls, cocks, dolphins and ostriches. R. concludes that the connection between ritual and comedy is only indirect. He emphasises the social rather than the religious aspect of k6moi. The animal depictions on the vases, which he discusses are products of archaic symposium culture which appears to have employed animal costumes. Animal choruses are not necessarily related to Dionysus, nor do they seem to be related to other gods. Chapter 3 deals with satyr plays as a counterpart for comedies with animal choruses. R. argues that both animals and satyrs made the audience think about the relationship between humans and animals. He discusses new ideas in the fifth century about this relationship, such as a kinship between humans and animals and the notion that human culture evolved from animal savagery. This had a great influence upon the depiction of animals in comedy as social animals. R. notes that while in myth the boundaries between human and animal may be crossed (e.g. in a metamorphosis) but are not blurred, comedy constantly plays with obliterating human-animal boundaries by giving animal characters a partially human nature and providing humans with animal characteristics. R. concludes that 'animal choruses belonged to a particular historical moment' (p. 101) in which the idea of an equality of humans and animals The Classical Review vol. 58 no. 2 ?

In the fourth century, Greek thinking about the kinship of humans and animals changed; this seems to be a reason why animal choruses lost popularity then. Chapters 4 and 5 analyse the choruses of Aristophanes' Birds, Wasps, Frogs and Knights and the fragments of plays with animal choruses, sorted by species. R. discusses how, in spite a certain degree of continuity, the representation of animals in comic choruses was in part different from that in earlier vase-paintings, especially in that there was a much higher degree of anthropomorphism in the fifth-century choruses. Literary and archaeological evidence suggests that animal choruses, after a period of popularity, disappeared in the middle of the fifth century and then were revived for a while before disappearing for good at the beginning of the fourth century, when comedy was assimilated by the democracy. R. refers back to his earlier treatments of nature and culture when he discusses the conflict and possible social disruption which arise as the consequences of anthropomorphism: humans cannot really eat humanised animals. The whole of Chapter 5 is devoted to Birds. R. interprets the play as a parody of the theory of progress (i.e. the development from savagery to civilisation). Although the polis of the birds is based on physis, progress is possible because the birds are social animals. R. compares the steps made during the establishment of the bird polis with those in the Archaeology' of Thucydides. He also compares Peisetaerus to Minos as an empire-builder. He interprets Peisetaerus' actions in an extremely positive light, even the roasting of the rebel birds. R. concludes that animal choruses are like Dionysus in that they eliminate the differences between humans and animals, but unlike Dionysus in that in doing so they confirm rather than destroy the social order. There are two very practical appendices, which provide texts and translations of the testimonia and fragments of the lost comedies used in this study and a list of miscellaneous depictions of animal costumes. The book has eight high-quality colour plates and numerous black-and-white text figures. R.'s arguments are presented in a convincing manner and the amount of evidence he provides is impressive. He shows compellingly that animal choruses have a variety of origins, not just in ritual. R.'s interpretations of the complete and the fragmentary plays are thoughtful and convincing.
