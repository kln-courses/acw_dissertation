<plain_text><page sequence="1">Francis Grant in Edinburgh Thomas Tuohy Francis Grant succeeded Lawrence as the leading society portrait painter after 1830 and succeeded Eastlake as President of the Royal Academy in 1866, when he was responsible for the transfer of the Academy from Trafalgar Square to Burlington House, where the first Summer Exhibition was held in 1869. Although he received royal patronage, Queen Victoria was later to prefer the more glamorous style of Winterhalter after 1842, and Grant was only second choice as President of the Royal Academy after the Queen's favourite painter Landseer declined the honour. The Queen was rather disparaging about Grant, writing to the Prime Minister, Lord Russell, 'The Queen will knight Mr Grant when she is at Windsor. She cannot say she thinks his selection a good one for Art. He boasts of never having been to Italy or studied the old masters. He has decidedly much talent, but it is the talent of an amateur.' Even when Grant had earlier enjoyed royal patronage the Queen has described him in her diary in 1838 as ' ... a very good -looking man, was a gentleman, married a Miss Norman, spent all his fortune, and now paints for money'. Miss Norman was related to the Duke of Rutland, and Grant's, success was in no small part due to his social connections. The younger son of a Perthshire laird, at the age of 15 he inherited a substantial portion, which he worked his way through in nine years, spending indulgently on fox hunting, and losing at whist. He married well twice, and the dashing and elegant portrait of his first brother- in-law, in highland dress, James Farquharson of Invercauld, painted in 1844, demonstrates why he was so popular as a society portrait painter. Grant was well connected from birth and encouraged by Lord Elgin, who lent him a Velázquez to copy, and by Sir Walter Scott, whose portrait he painted. He also benefited from the example of the distinguished Scots painters Raeburn and Wilkie, and it was to Wilkie that he was indebted for the informal groupings of hunt scenes that played a large part in his oeuvre, although the landscape backgrounds were painted by others. The exhibition at the Paris Exposition Universelle in 1855 of The Ascot Hunt , painted 20 years earlier, met with acclaim, his compositional skills being compared with the fashionable Meissonier. Grant was not without his technical limitations - poor perspective and an inability to set figures convincingly in space, combined with weak drawing and a palette limited to black and mud, with a few flashes of scarlet and white - but he was very good at capturing a likeness and character, and he handled his paint well. Grant's work is represented in the houses of some of the grandest families of the time, but a substantial exhibition in Edinburgh has now made it possible for us to assess the work of this, by now, fairly obscure painter. Grant moved comfortably in hunting circles, and was to be buried in Melton Mowbray. The Melton Breakfast , from the Wemyss collection, is a wonderful evocation of a relaxed Trollopian moment, and A Meet of the Fife Hounds and A Meet of the Buccleuch Hounds , both of 1833, are both filled with characterful portraits of men and animals, but without the anthropomorphic sentimentality that pervades the works of Landseer. Portraits of Edward Nugent, 6th Earl of Milltown, from Dublin, and of Sir Tatton Sykes, 4th Bt , from a private collection, are both fine evocations of the pleasures of landownership and country pursuits, but Grant was equally good at capturing masculine swagger, as in Sir James Brooke or the sketch for the 7th Earl of Cardigan (NPG). The contrast between the dandified dark curls and fleshy lips of Benjamin Disraeli (National Trust, Hughenden Manor) and the stolidly respectable Sir Edward Landseer (National Portrait Gallery, London) illustrates this ability well. Grant was less successful with women and children, at least in terms of establishing character, but it is an indication of Grant's eclecticism that he could provide images to complement portraits that his patrons already possessed. Lord Charles Scott is clearly indebted to an earlier Reynolds of Lady Caroline Scott as Winter , both with the Duke of Buccleuch as Bowhill. Queen Victoria was not entirely correct in suggesting that Grant had not studied Old Masters (although it is debatable whether she would have thought of Van Dyck or Velázquez as Old Masters). The horse she rides in Queen Victoria riding out (Royal Collection) is taken from Van Dyck's Equestrian portrait of King Charles /, then at Blenheim and now in the National Gallery, and the equestrian portraits of Velázquez were an inspiration. Indeed the skillful uses of paint and limited palette that characterise the work of Velázquez have resonances in some of Grant's work. The detail of a pair of hands with grey gloves from the portrait of Grant's daughter painted in 1857, Mrs Markham (Private Collection) used on the cover of the catalogue, could easily be mistaken for the work of Manet, who was similarly indebted to Velázquez. This revealing and instructive exhibition has been based on the researches of Catherine Wills who has written a PhD thesis on Grant, and the catalogue provides a wealth of contemporary assessments of the painter, which in themselves serve as an indication of his status at the time. But it is a pity that the catalogue entries do not provide more information, and that the useful chronology which features on a wall label at the exhibition has not been included. There are also tantalising references to the list of portraits kept by Grant's second wife, about which it would be nice to know more.
