Taube, Department of Anthropology, ; University of California at Riverside Despite more than a century of careful investigation, there are still many aspects of ancient Maya religion that have been virtually unexplored. Quite frequently, this is due to the overuse of certain terms that become blanket explanations of disparate religious phenomena. Thus, for example, the concept of "gods" has frequently obscured the complexities of Classic Maya religion. Recent research by Stephen Houston and David Stuart has established that many Classic Maya entities labeled as gods are actually supernatural counterparts, or "co-essences," of historical people and even divine beings.1 In a similar vein, I have noted that many figures previously identified as Maya deities are actually ceremonial clowns, such as the one depicted in an Early Classic period two- part effigy vessel (figs. 1, 2, 6, and title page) in the collection of the Detroit Institute of Arts.2 The effigy vessel dates to the Classic Maya period (A.D. 300-900), the time when Maya culture underwent its greatest degree of development and complexity. The period is usually divided in two: the Early Classic (A.D. 300-600) and the Late Classic (A.D. 600-900). The major area of occupation during the Classic period was centered in the humid lowland regions of the Peten of Guatemala, as well as in neighboring portions of Mexico and Belize. Some of the more famous Maya sites of this era include Tikal, Uaxactun, Palenque, and Yaxchilan. Following the Classic period, there was a major depopulation of the central Maya lowlands. During the subsequent Postclassic period (A.D. 900-1521), there appears to have been a strong shift in population to the northern lowlands of the Yucatan Peninsula. Some of the major centers of this region include Uxmal, Chichen Itza, Mayapan, and Tulum. The end of the Postclassic era is marked by the conquering of the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan by the Spanish. Although the Maya of Yucatan were not under complete Spanish military control until 1546, the conquest of Tenochtitlan constituted the end of independent Mesoamerican civilization. The following colonial era marked a realignment of Maya culture in terms of Spanish doctrine and belief. Although the hieroglyphic writing and fine art of the native elite were suppressed, a considerable amount of Maya customs were preserved in colonial writings composed by Spanish and native Maya inhabitants. In addition, many folk rituals and beliefs of the common Maya have continued in altered form to the present day, both in the lowlands of Yucatan and in the mountainous regions of Chiapas, Guatemala, and neighboring Honduras.3 Much of the ritual clowning that appears in contemporary Maya ceremonies is clearly derived from traditions of the pre-Hispanic Maya. Ceremonial clowns are well docu- mented for the contemporary and early colonial Maya.4 Rather than being simply performers, these entertainers fulfill a vital role as social commentators by calling attention to particular vices and misdeeds. Through their burlesque and frequently grotesque performances, the ceremonial clowns reinforce social norms by illustrating the negative effects of anti-social behavior. Particular individuals in the community are frequently exposed and lampooned in these performances. Sexual misconduct, greed, and drunkenness are among the more common vices addressed by the sacred clowns. In the known performances of the colonial and contemporary Maya, ritual clowns tend to be portrayed as old, shabby, and decidedly ugly. Ceremonial drinking often accompanies the perform- Figure 1.

Frequently, the clowns impersonate animals and evil supernatural entities from the perimeters of the social world. Rattles and fans are often flourished by these performers as articles of dance. Ritual clowning was an important com- ponent of Classic Maya religion as well. In Classic Maya art, there are many representations of individuals that can be identified as Maya ritual clowns. Thus, these figures are frequently aged and are almost diametrically opposed to Classic Maya conventions of beauty. Whereas Maya lords are usually portrayed in the prime of youth with fine aquiline noses, the clowns are frequently pug-nosed with deeply furrowed faces. Often, the clowns are strange blends of human and animal physiognomy. It is still frequently possible, however, to discern that they wear masks, leggings, and other articles of costume. These figures often appear with rattles and fans in clear postures of dance. The dance accoutrements and postures are especially important, since they depict actual per- formances rather than just the mythical deeds of gods. As in contemporary clown performances, the Classic Maya dancers are impersonating demons, gods, and other supernaturais. Moreover, since the ancient art depicts idealized representations of the performers, there tends to be a subtle gradation between the actual clown and the supernatural character portrayed. One of the most common themes in ancient and contemporary Maya ritual clowning is the amorous pairing of an aged and often fantastically ugly male with a beautiful young woman. In modern renditions, the female character is usually portrayed by a male, which tends to make the performance all the more ironic. A fine Jaina figurine in the Detroit Institute of 20 Figure 3.

Although this figurine displays no obvious allusion to a ritual performance, there are many other Late Classic scenes that illustrate the amorous couple theme as a dance. On one Late Classic vessel (fig. 4), the young woman and aged male are clearly dancing, with the old man holding a fan in his hands. Both the Jaina figurine and this scene appear to depict the aged character as the deity known as Pauahtun, or God N in the Paul Schellhas system of deity classification. This old and frequently drunken god appears to have been one of the more important characters portrayed by Classic Maya clowns. One of the most explicit depictions of the amorous couple dance occurs on another polychrome vase (fig. 5). Flanked by musicians, the couple is again clearly dancing, with the male wielding both the fan and rattle. Moreover, his obscenely elongated nose is plainly false, and it is probable that the entire face is a mask. The two-part ceramic effigy vessel in the Detroit Institute of Arts (figs. 1,2, and title page) is a fine representation of an Early Classic Maya ritual clown. The vessel depicts a seated figure wearing a curious suit of coarse material that leaves the hands, feet, and upper chest and neck exposed. A helmet mask, evidently of the same material as the suit, covers much of the head and face. The exposed skin is bur- nished smooth, in contrast to the suit and much of the mask. In addition to the suit and mask, the figure wears a loincloth, headband, earspools, and a circular chest pendant, all delineated with burnished orange-red slip. Although seated, the figure is far from static. Rather, the severely erect shoulders and head and the partially crouching position of the legs provide a certain dynamic tension. It appears that the artist captured the character poised in dance. The hands of the figure are depicted palms outward, one hand pointing up, and the other downward. In Classic Maya art, this posture is frequently used to indicate dance.6 Quite similar examples of two-part effigy vessels have been excavated at the Guatemalan sites of Uaxactun and Kaminaljuyu.7 In both cases, the vessels were discovered in Early Classic tombs. At Uaxactun, a number of the effigy vessels contained copal incense. These vessels probably served as incense burners. Thus, the hollow figures, including the Detroit example* are provided with perforations through the mouth, eyes, and skull that would allow for smoke to coil out of the face and head (see fig. 6). The effigy censers known from Uaxactun, Kaminaljuyu, and museum and private collections often depict entertainers. Two of the effigy censers from Uaxactun represent hunchbacks. In ancient Mesoamerica, hunchbacks and dwarves widely served as court entertainers. The Detroit figure illustrates another important motif: a figure wearing a coarse suit and mask. The material appears to be composed of a rough fibrous substance, such as woven grass. Although two Uaxactun effigy censers depict human-faced figures wearing the suit, the garment is usually accompanied by a zoomorphic mask.8 Quite frequently, the mask is cut widely around the mouth and eyes, creating the impression of a spider monkey. An excel- lent example of this mask can be seen on the upper half of an unprovenanced two- part effigy vessel (fig. 7). Due to its droll antics, the spider monkey was commonly identified with dance, clowning, and entertainment in ancient Mesoamerica. In 21 Figure 4.

However, the suit is not entirely simian; there is no attempt to represent the prehensile tail, and, moreover, the nose is frequently anthropomorphic. The characters por- trayed by these suits appear to be a blend of simian and human traits. Individuals wearing the coarse suit and mask are not limited to Early Classic effigy censers. During the Late Classic period, figures displaying this outfit are wide- spread in Maya art. Forms of the costume even appear as a hieroglyph, a personified form of the sign providing the phonetic value of pa (fig. 8a). Like certain of the Early Classic censer examples, the face frequendy has a human nose and much of the covering cloth removed from around the mouth and eyes. When represented as a full figure glyph, it can be seen that this figure wears a body suit with no indication of a tail.10 Forms of the suited character are not limited to hieroglyphic writing. Examples are also found on Late Classic portable objects where they commonly appear dancing with rattles and in drinking scenes. The intoxicating beverage is either drunk or taken rectally via a cut gourd enema (figs. 8b-c). In Late Classic Maya art, the personified pa character frequently assumes the role of the aged ugly male in the amorous young woman and old man theme.1 1 The character portrayed by the Detroit effigy vessel differs from the typical personified pa figure in one major way. The nose is not human but feline, and in addition, the figure sports a pronounced handlebar mustache. The same character appears on two other unprovenanced 23 Figure 6.

Personified pa clown with jaguar holding enema, detail of carved peccary skull, Copan. Early Classic effigy censers (figs. 9, 10). However, these examples do not wear the coarse suit. Nonetheless, one of the censers (fig. 9) clearly wears a mask that covers much of the upper face. Unlike the Detroit piece, both of these figures display conspicuous canine teeth. The prominent mustache probably represents cat whiskers reinterpreted into human form. It appears likely that this is a composite entity simultaneously displaying feline and human attributes. One of the figures (fig. 11) has an especially pronounced bulging brow, which is typical of Classic Maya representations of achondroplastic dwarves.12 As opposed to midgets, achondroplastic dwarves exhibit abnormalities in physical proportions, such as shorter limbs, a sunken nose bridge, and a projecting brow. When viewed in this light, the body proportions of this piece are very much like that of a rotund dwarf. Although in less exaggerated form, both the Detroit vessel and the other cited example have bulging brows, and it is likely that they are also intended to represent dwarves. During the Early Classic period, the mustachioed character was not limited to effigy censers. He commonly occurs in contemporaneous ceramic art from the state of Escuintla, Guatemala (see fig. 13). Nicholas Hellmuth termed the figure appearing in Escuintla art Curly Face and noted that he is also found on ceramic vessels from Kaminaljuyu and the distant site of Monte Alban, Oaxaca. Janet Berlo subsequently described examples of this entity from Lake Atitlan, Guatemala.13 Like the effigy censer examples, Curly Face is usually provided with a large scroll mus- tache, pronounced canines, and the bulging brow suggestive of dwarfism. Clearly, the three aforementioned effigy censers, including the Detroit figure, are examples of the Curly Face entity. A magnificent Early Classic wooden statuette (fig. 10) in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, displays the prominent attributes of the Curly Face character. Thus, he has the same large curling mustache, small nose, and bulging brow. Gordon Ekholm has suggested that this kneeling figure may have held a four- sided iron pyrite mirror or other plaque- like object between the extended arms and knees.14 I suspect that the object was a mirror, such as were commonly used in divination in ancient Mesoamerica. In Classic Maya art, dwarves appear in court scenes holding mirrors against their abdomens.15 The wooden statuette may represent a courtly dwarf, the mirror- bearer for a Maya king. In view of stylistic considerations and archaeological context, it seems that the great majority of two-part effigy censers were made during the sixth century. Moreover, all the examples of the Curly Face character also appear to be limited to this relatively narrow period of time. There are no clear examples of this entity known for earlier Classic or Protoclassic Meso- america, or for the Late Classic period.16 In addition, there are no documented examples of this entity known for the northern lowlands of Yucatan. Instead, the majority of representations derive from Guatemala. It is, therefore, quite likely the example in the Detroit Institute of Arts was fashioned in the central Maya lowlands during the sixth century. The Curly Face character is also common to only certain media. Aside from the previously cited a.

At present, there are no known depictions of Curly Face in painted vessel scenes or on Maya monumental sculpture. The significance and identity of Curly Face is still poorly known. According to Berlo, this entity was a rain deity possessing characteristics common to the Central Mexican Tlaloc, the Zapotee Cocijo, the Maya Chac, and other major rain gods of ancient Mesoamerica. The curling mouth element does bear a strong resemblance to Tlaloc from Escuintla and the later Cotzumalhuapa-style art of Guatemala.17 However, in the case of Tlaloc, the curling device appears to be an upper lip, not a mustache. The Curly Face character differs from Tlaloc in several other ways. The Maya entity frequently has a deeply fur- rowed, convoluted face and lacks the large goggle eyes of Tlaloc. In addition, the achondroplastic bulging brow of Curly Face is not a trait of Tlaloc. In view of how little is known of the Curly Face character, it is unwarranted to consider this figure a god. Although it is conceivable that the entity is thematically related to Tlaloc, this is by no means certain. The short life of this character does not fit the pattern of major Maya gods, who tended to be worshipped over a long period of time. Rather than constitut- ing a religious cult, his florescence may correspond to local fashion trends regarding coiffure and costume. Two of the most salient characteristics of this character are his feline and dwarf attributes. It is possible that during the sixth century, the Maya identified dwarves with jaguars and dressed them accordingly during certain Figure 10.

Dwarves are frequently found wearing jaguar skin kilts in Maya monumental art of the Late Classic period. These kilts are worn with the tail hanging intact at the back, as if the dwarf were wearing a jaguar tail.18 It appears that the Early Classic two-part effigy censers frequently depict offices of the sixth-century Maya court. The two-part censers are only documented in funerary contexts. In view of their generally excellent condition, it is probable that the unprove- nanced examples also derive from tombs. Like the wooden statuette, these objects may have served as surrogates for actual performers, scribes, and other individuals to accompany the king to the afterlife. Rather than representing a distinct god, the Curly Face character may actually depict an idealized dwarf. The feline attributes suggest that, during the sixth century, Maya dwarves may have been considered as being especially otherworldly, perhaps as supernatural hybrids of human and jaguar.19 Unfortunately, we know little about the significance of dwarves during the Early Classic period. In part, this is due to the paucity of Early Classic palace and throne scenes. During the subsequent Late Classic period, dwarves are a common feature in palace scenes and often appear in close proximity to enthroned kings. It is clear that during the Late Classic period, dwarves were esteemed members of the Maya court. Due to their rarity, they were probably jealously guarded by Maya nobility as signs of status. Recent epigraphic research by Stephen Houston has established that in Late Classic monumental texts, dwarves are often referred to by titles and personal names.20 27 Figure 11.

Sonnery, Rediscovered Masterpieces of Meso- america (Boulogne, France, 1985), plate 341.</page><page sequence="11">The wooden statuette in the Metropolitan Museum suggests that dwarves were also an important part of the Early Maya court. The probable role of mirror-bearer per- formed by this figure suggests that during the sixth century, dwarves were more than simply entertainers, but rather, may have served a variety of offices. The afore- mentioned masked effigy censer (fig. 9) may depict a dwarf in the role of scribe. Thus, the figure appears with a possible writing implement. It may even be that his index finger serves as the writing device. A codex style vessel recently excavated by Richard Hansen at the Guatemalan site of Nakbe depicts a scribe using his index finger in such a fashion.21 During the Late Classic period, dwarves also appear as scribes. A particularly fine example is the stone statue from Copan Structure 9N-82 (fig. 12). Although this scribe has often been identified as a monkey, he displays the bulging brow and sunken nose common to achondroplastic dwarves. The two-part censer in Detroit appears to depict yet another courtly role, in this case the dwarf as ritual clown. The figure's coarse suit suggests the dress of the Classic Maya clown, as frequently found in Classic Maya iconography. Poised in dance, this figure was fashioned to entertain his royal owner for eons to come. 28 Figure 12. Maya, God N Dwarf Scribe, A.D. 600/800; stone, h. 55.6 cm (21% in.).

The two Uaxactun figures both display vertical crosshatched bands on the face (see Smith 1955 [note 7), figs. 5e, h, i, k). Because the crosshatched areas are identical to markings found on the body suits, it is likely that the figures are wearing masks. 9. E.

However, in this case the curls are not whiskers but rather emerge from the corners of the mouth. Moreover, the eyes are shut. Rather than depicting early forms of Curly Face, these vessels may represent trophy heads. 17. See ibid., plate 175; and L.
