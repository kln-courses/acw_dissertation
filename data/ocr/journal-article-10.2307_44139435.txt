<plain_text><page sequence="1">PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS Upendra Thakur Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to thank the Executive Committee of the Indian History Congress for the great honour they have done me in electing me President of Section IV of this session. While I am most grateful to you for this, I am well aware of my shortcomings. As scholars like you always accept the essential good and reject the residue, I request you to lend ear to a few words I have to say in inaugurating the proceedings of this section. India's political and cultural relations in ancient times with the countries of South- East Asia, Central Asia, parts of West Asia Africa and other countries are very old and well known and there ere many good books which throw light on these well established relations. But, so far no serious effort has been made by Indian scholars to present a documented history of early cultural contacts between India and Japan.1 I would therefore like to present a brief survey outlining the age-old cultural ties between the two countries which may be re- warding for those interested in studies in cultural contacts between different countries in early times. I It is really surprising to find that Japan had very little direct contact with India which actually moulded its spiritual life. This was partly because of the great distance between the two countries and partly due to immense difficulty of travelling thousands of miles by sea and hostile lands. Notwithstanding these hazards and obstacles the Japanese Buddhists managed some how or other to establish contact with India which was to them their spiritual motherland. It has been rightly pointed out that "although the substance of Japanese Bud- dhism was based on Chinese Buddhism, it was always known that Buddhism was originally an Indian religion. However, it has only been in recent times that direct relations with India have been esta-</page><page sequence="2">864 blished. The name Tenjiku (the old name of India) has often had an unrealistic echo (for instance, the literature of the Heian Court)".1 As we know, Sino-lndian contacts started sometime in the third or second century B.C. with close cultural and spiritual collaborations between India end China during the reignperiod of the Han dynasty (206 B. C,- 220 A. D.).s It was Buddhism which was chiefly instrumental in bringing these two great nations still closer since 70 A. D. when Buddhism was officially recognised as the established religion in the land of Confucianism and Taoism.4 Thus, from the beginning of the Christian era Buddhism served as a great vehicle of spiritual ideas and influenced all spheres of life in China which was second to none in matters of highly developed language, literature, art and philosophy. And, by the fourth centry A. D. Buddhism had become an inseparable part of Chinese life.5 In the first half of the fourth century A. D. Buddhism entered Korea from north Chinese countries where it was accepted not as an Indian religion but as the quintessence of Chinese civilisation.' However Koreas close political contact with Japan paved the way for the spread of this religion in that country also.7 The Yamato Court, then the central power of Japan, received an embassy from the King of Packche which was accompanied by Buddhist priests together with "an image of Shaka Butsu (i. e. Saykmuni Buddha) in gold and copper, several flags and umbrellas and a number of sutras."8 These gifts and messages, we are told, served as "a marvellous revelation" to the people of Japan who could not conceive of any superior divinity, They were deeply impressed with the inherent message of Buddhism and its philosophy of love, equality and non-violence. "They were overwhelmed by the legend of the Sakyamuni Buddha, the deified superman who attained the height of the religious power, but looked after the welfare and salvation of all living beings".9 Again, it was the Korean kingdom of Packche whence Japan received besides Dharma, her first scribes painters and calligraphers - an event which was so momentous that it was recorded in the Nihon Shok i in the years 463, 544, 588, etc. Astrologers, landscape-architects, pharmacists, painters, bridge-builders and bhiksus arrived from Korea to promote the rise of Dharma in the land of the Rising Sun. Empress Suiko (593 A.D.) appointed her nephew Prince Shotoku Taishl as</page><page sequence="3">863 regent who later came to be known as the Asoka of India, the con- solidates of the Dharma in Japan. Credit for constructing the wonderful Horyuji temple goes to this Prince, whose splendour captured the hearts of all men and evoked wonder and awe. While speaking of religion we have to remember that, besides Buddhism which influenced almost all the spheres of Japanese life, Brahmanism also played a very significant role in moulding Japanese character and culture. The new teachings of the Shingon sect originated in India much before it was introduced in China in the eighth century A. D. The Shingon or esoteric principles are based on Tantric rituals which were practised in India by the followers of Brahmanical religion since early times. We have mention of certain aspects of esoterism in the Rgveda which also refers to various mysterious formulae. It is true. Tantra as an independent cult, did not emerge on the religious scene in India before the fifth and sixth centuries A. D.,10 nevertheless the Tantric phase of Buddhism became pronounced from the time of Asanga who introduced esoteric elements in Buddhism in the third-fourth centuries A. D. It is popu- larly believed that the Tantras were the common heritage of both Brahmanism and Buddhism,11 and though China received esoterism in the fourth century A.D., it actually flourished there from the eighth century. From there it reached Japan through Saicho (Dengyo Daishi) and Kukai (Kobo Daishi).18 Esoteric Buddhism of the Tendai and the Shingon sects is closely related and both flourished in Japan for about three hundred years. The occult and secret teachings of Buddhism had strongly influenced Buddhist art in Japan.13 The Shingon Buddhists are advised to attain supernatural power through the practice of secret formulae which is closely connected with symbolic diagram called Mandara (Skt. Mandala). This consists of two parts- (i) the Konga Kai Mandara ('Skt. Vojradhatu Mandala). also known as the Mandala of the Diamond World and (ii) the Taizo-Kai Mandara (Skt. Garbhadhatu Mandala or the Mandala of the Matric World. The Central diety in the Mandara is Dainichi Nyorai (Mahavairocana Buddha) or the Supreme Buddha. In the usual rectangular arrangements of the two Mandaras, Dainichi Nyorai is surrounded by hundreds of deities "who represent his various cosmic attributes."14 The Mandara is invariably associated</page><page sequence="4">866 with the depiction of numerous heavenly figures which in turn inspired the painters of the Heian period and the succeeding ages to draw images of various deities. In other words, the Mandara figures enriched Japanese iconography and a large number of Brahmanical gods and goddesses were introduced in Japan which revolutionised the very Japanese concept of art.'5 The Chinese carried Buddhist thoughts and ideas in purely Indian form when they adopted Buddhism as their faith. At the outset the Chinese Buddhism was essentially Indian in character, following the same procedures as prescribed in Indian texts in matters of image- worship. The Brahmanical deities accepted in Indian Buddhism naturally found their way to China as a part of Buddhist pantheon, and the mode of worship of these divinities was exactly the same as followed by the Buddhists in India. A stage, however, came when the Chinese transformed the Indian elements in Buddhism in their own way" with the result that the character and role of the Buddhism- oriented Brahmanical gods and goddesses who found their way to Japan from China slightly changed, being 'hued in the Chinese dye'. These Brahmanical deities in the course of time again passed through another phase of transformation to suit the Japanese thoughts and ideas, and many of these transformed deities gained highly revered positions which they had never before attained either in India or in China In fact, several minor Brahmanical gods and goddesses who were too insignificant to merit careful attention in India attained a considerably exalted position in Japanese Buddhist pantheon. Most of such deities as have gone into oblivion in the very land of their inception have been accorded a permanent place in that far-off land and are even now worshipped in the various temples with great reverence along with Buddhist divinities. But, all told, the fact remains that these deities, in spite of their significant position are, to some extent, subservient to their Buddhist counterparts whom they are supposed to protect as the acolytes of the Buddha and the Bodhisattvas and also as the guardians of the Buddhist faith. It is commonly believed in Japan that the Brahmanical deities, if wor- shipped properly, bestow quickly material benefits and other favours in day to day life on their devotees rather than any spiritual gain. This ¡has made these gods and goddesses very popular in Japan as</page><page sequence="5">867 the common people are more interested in wordly or material benefits than In the so-called abstract spiritual achievement. It would thus be seen that there was no chage in the basic attitude of the Indian Buddhists towards the Brahmanical divinities. Indian Buddhist thoughts and ideas were directly carried to China from India and as such the Chinese Buddhism in the beginning was essentially Indian in character. However, the image worship in China followed the procedures prescribed in Buddhist texts of India. This naturally led to the adoption of those Brahmanical deities in China who were already incorporated in Buddhist pantheon in India, and thus they also came to be duly honoured and worshipped in Indian fashion. Of the various Brahmanical divinities who were widely worship- ped in Japan side by side with the Buddhist deities mention may be made of India ( Taishaku-ten ), Varuna (Sui-ten), Yama (Emma), Agni (Ka-ten), Mahakala ( Daikoku-ten ), Sarasvati ( Benzai-ten or Benten) Ganesa ( Sho-ten or Kangi-ten), Brahma {Bon-ten), Vayu (Hu-ten), Vaisravana or Kubera (Bishamon-ten) Mahesvavara (Makeishura-ten), Isana(lshana-ten), Nilakantha(Shokyo Kannon), Mahakala (Daikoku). Prthvi (Ji-ten), Surya (Nit-ten), Candra (Gat-ten), Narayana or Visnu (Naraen-ten), Kumara or Karttikeya (Kumara-ten), Laksmi (Kichito- ten or Kissho-ten) are many other minor deities.17 But, as we have noted above, the primary role of these Brahmanical deities in Japan was to protect the Buddha and the Buddhist world. Although, the iconography of the Buddhist deities was invariably represented in set forms in strict accordance with the prescriptions laid down in the sacred texts, this was not so in respect of the depictions of the subservient and comparativly less important Brahmanical deities. For instance, Indra, the king of gods, in spite of his subordinate status, played a very important role in Buddhism as its virtual protector. In China and Japan he is widely worshipped as a guardian-deity of whom we have innumerable images in both countries portrayed with his usual vajra (thunder-bolt), and guarding the entrance of some monastery or temple.18 Besides him, Agni is also one of the twelve guardian-deities in Japan who is everywhere depicted as guarding the south-east corner. He naturally finds his place in Japanese mandara which has remarkable similarity with the representation of</page><page sequence="6">868 Agni in some Indian sculptures.10 But compared to his inferior position in Hindu pantheon in early periods he seems to have occupied a sonewhat respectable position in Tantric Buddhism. The worship of Yama seems to have been incorporated in the cult of Ju-o or Ten kings which probably originated in China during the rule of the Six Dynasties (260-589 A. D.), shortly after the introduction of Buddhism there. Like other Brahmanical deities Varuna also played a somewhat minor role in Indian Buddhism and he is the only digpala (a guardian of directions) who plays a uniform role both in India and Japanese Buddhism. In Japanese mythology he belongs to the group of Twelve Deva Kings (Juni ten). The other gods who play a signifi- cant nart in the religious life of the Japanese people are Mahesvara (Makeishura-ten), otherwise called Siva, of whom various forms have been conceived in Japan. He is depicted as having two, four, eight and eighteen arms and riding a cow (bull ?).21 Mahakala (Daikoku), the terrific god (another form of Siva), whose images abound in the temples of Tibet and China enjoys as exalted position as a household deity in Japan22 whose association with wealth and prosperity gave rise to a strange but interesting custom known as Fuku-nusubi ('fortune-stealing'). This custom started with the belief that he, who stole divine figures (gods and goddesses) was assured of good fortune, if not caught in the act of stealing. In the course of time stealing of divine images became so common a practice in Japan that the Toshi no-ichi or the 'Year-end-market' held in the Asakusa Kannon temple became the main venue of the sale and disposal of such images by the fortune-seekers. Many small stalls were opened where articles including images of Daikoku or Mahakala were sold on the eve of New Year celebrations, and there also the fortune seekers stole away the Daikoku images for clandestine business.23 In ancient times, the Japanese warriors went to war in helmets bearing Sanskrit bijas as benediction for victory. Such helmets can still be seen at the Reihokan Museum at Koyasan. The Tokonoma or alcoves in Japanese parlours often have a smiling image of Daikoku or Mahakala, clad in Japanese robes and standing on two bags of rice representing affluence. Mahakala symbolised the Great Time (maha=great and ka!a= time) : the time of affluence, in</page><page sequence="7">869 contradistinction to a-kafa ("famine") : the negation (a) of good time (kala). The Japanese also maintain the bijaksara of Mahakala as a Siddham-nagari monogram. The traditional piligrims climbing the holy Mount Ontake wear tenugui or white Japanese scarves with the sacred mantra Om.u Visnu, one of the Puranic trinity, though immensely popular in India, did not find any important place outside the texts and mandaras in Japan, though the Japanese Naraen-ten has many common features with Brahmanical Visnu. On the other hand, Ganesa or Sho-ten (Vinayaka) seems to have been a widely worshipped god in Japan with whom is associated the Chinese-Japanese ideas of the elephant-headed male-female embracing Vinayaka. He is without doubt the product of the introduction of Tantricism in China and Japan which envisaged an elephant-headed yogini form of female- Vinayaka giving birth to a new concept of Vinayaka couple both elephant-headed - a unique development in the religious history of Japan.25 Besides the above, deities like Skanda-Karttikeya, Sarasvati and Laksmi were also extremely popular in Japan. Moreover, raksasas and the asuras, too, find popular mention in Japanese mythology and scriptures. From the above study it would be seen that co-existence of the native Shinto and Indian Buddhist and Brahmanical deities in the same temple was, and is, a common feature in Japan. It is in this process that sometimes we find Shinto divinities revealing themselves as Buddhist-Brahmanical deities which is clearly evident in the case of Shao-ten or Ganesa. This trend was further responsible for the identification Daikoku-Mahakala with Okuni-Nushi-no-Kami laying greater importance upon the latter. In the course of centuries certain ideas relating to Shintoism were suitably changed in Buddhist- Brahmanical fashion and Shinto deities were given Buddhist garb with a view to impressing upon the people that they were no less powerful than their Buddhist counter-parts, Interestingly, the Buddist- Brahmanical clergy did not oppose this trend as it helped them in spreading the new religion among the people. II The first Indian monk to enter Korea was Malananda86 who is said to have come from Eastern Tsin in 334 A.D., and spread Buddhism</page><page sequence="8">m in Pai-Chi which marked the beginning of Pai-Chi Buddhism, and "in contrast to Buddhism promulgated by Shun-tao27 in 372 A. D. in Kao-li, by E-taos8 in 374 A. D. in Hsin-lo and by others, this was spread by one who was an Indian monk".** Though we are not in a position to determine the route followed by Malananda for coming over to China from India, the very fact that an Indian monk reached Korea is of great significance keeping in view the eastern advance of Indian culture. The other Indians who came to Japan very early were the Brahmana priest Bodhisena*0 and the Campa monk, Fo-che.31 Indians who were Fa-tao (Dharmamarga or Dharmapatha ?) one said to have come to Japan by way of China and Pai-Chi much before the coming of Bodhisena and Fo-che, but it is difficult to vouchsafe for its historicity in present state of our knowledge. The early culture of Japan flowered during the Nara period of which the finest symbol is the Mahavairocana Buddha at Nara where Bodhisena had acted as the officiating priest at the time of celebrating the completion of the Mahavairocana Buddha constructed by order of the Emperor Shomu. Born in a South Indian Brahmana family of the Bharadvaja clan Bodhisena reached T'ang by way of the South Sea, and in response to an invitation from Emperor Shomu he set sail with-Fo-Che and a certain Tao-hsuan, a member of a branch of the northern sect, Zen Buddhism and reached Japan in 736 A.D. where he stayed till his death in 760 A. D. On his arrival he was duly honoured by the Japanese court and came to be popularly known as Baramon Sojo or the Brahmana Bishop. He was well-versed in the Buddha- avatamsaka-mahavaipulya sutra and he acted as the chief priest when the world's greatest glided statue of Daibutsu or the Great Buddha ( Buddha-Locana or Vairocana) was installed in the Todai-ji temple in Nara and the Kigen rite (the ceremony of the "Opening of the Buddha's eyes") performed in 752 A.D.'* This statue was modelled upon the originator of the Hua-yen Sutra, the Mahavairocana Buddha. He also taught Amitabhabuddha faith and Kuanyin faith, and lived in the Daian-ji temple where he taught Sanskrit to his disciples." Another monk Kibi-no-Makibi who was returning to Japan from China in the same ship by which Bodhisena was coming to Japan in 736 A.D. "is also said to have invented the Kata-kana syllabary, and if this is true, he may have learned something of the Sanskrit alphabet from Budhisena and made use of the knowledge".*4</page><page sequence="9">871 The Campa monk Fo-Che or Fo-Tie'h who came to Japan with Budhisena was probably "a native of ancient Campa that lay in India in the modern Bhagalpur region on the the southeren bank of the Ganges".*1 He also lived in the Daianji temple, wrote a book on Sanskrit alphabet and composed religious dances representing themes drawn from Indian mythology.*7 He is also credited with having trans- mitted Campa music. These religious dances and the accompanying music have been faithfully preserved in their original form in the royal court of Japan although they are completely unknown to the Indians now. "ft is a unique cultural asset found only in Japan and it is one of the wonders of the world. ..The formal stage for this art is found only in the Imperial Palace. The names of some pieces of music can be traced to Indian originals; for instance, Bosatsu is the Japanese corruption of Bodhisattva, Bairo of Bhairava, Karyobin of Ka/avimka, a monorous sweetvoiced bird"37 In fact, these two Indians, who in the Nara period travelled so far as to reach Japan, contributed a great deal by imparting the richness of Indian culture to Japanese culture. The Japanese legends further speak of one Indian priest Hodo Dharma- marga or Dharmapatha) who is said to have gone over to Japan in the time of Emperor Kokotu (645-654 A. D.) from Rajagrha. But, unfor- tunately we have no details of his activities there. Kukai was the most celebrated Buddhist priest of Japan who had studied Sanskrit in China between 804 and 806 A. D. from Prajna - an Indian monk who was staying in China during this period. Prajna was Kashmirian acarya who had gone to China in the beginning of the ninth century. He radiated the divine spark, the light of intelle- ctual knowledge and psychic experience, as his very name implied. His masterly knowledge of Sanskrit was reficted in the Chinese translation of Sanskrit works. In 805 A. D., on a spring day, in the famed metropolis of Ch'ang-an stood a young monk from Japan whom the Shingon chronicles describe as "a young man with a broad forehead, well-shaped eye-brows and intelligent looks, who listened silently to the discourses of his aged guru". This young man was Sramana Kukai who later became famous as Kobo Daishi. He had left his home-land in quest of an integrated vision and a rich, pure experience, of the esoteric doctrine of mantrayana or Shingon, 'the true word', which was the culmination of Budhdhism, a new</page><page sequence="10">872 horizon and a paradigm of new universe, grounded in the funda- mentals of mantras The power, the wonder of the mantra lay in its meditational realisation, and its correct enunciation as a written symbol. The letter-shapes reflected the spans of inner space. Thus, the script used for the mantras was not purely a writing system, but a visual medium of an intrinsic dimension. Kobo Daishi was intro- duced by the Kashmirian acarya into the Nagari script (proto Gupta) of the period, designated by the Japanese tradition as shittan, a corruption of the Sanskrit word siddham. To this day the Japanese have written mantras in artistic siddham-nagari, the contribution of Kashmir evoking the cosmic consciousness. The form of Nagari has a calligraphic charm of its own, in expressive curves and subtle linear nuances of the brush, or in sturdy and dynamic strokes of wooden stylus bringing out its innate aesthetics. Scholars therefore rightly believe that Kukai or Kobo Daishi "introduced into Japan the slightly altered form of Devanagari letters called Shittan which is written in vertical columns and much used in Singon books".39 It was he who "composod the Iroho, the Japanese alphabet, in which the Buddhist thought of mutability, and spiritual awakening is poetically expressed."®* This poem, it is interesting to note, is based on the Mahaparinirvanasutra ( sarve sams ka rah a nity ah utpadadvayadharminah. Tesam vyupasamah sukham avadad maha- sramanah"). A number of Japanese monks learnt Sanskrit language in which the Buddhist mantras were written.4* Of them Annen was perhaps the most remarkable scholar of the ninth century who wrote a Sanskrit glossary, named Shittanzo in eight volumes. We are told that the "fifty sound syllabary pattern of a. /, u, e, o, which is used even now in Japan, was an imitation of the order of letters in Sanskrit",*1 introduce by Annen and those of his school. As in Cambodia and many other countries of South- East Asia, so in Japan, Sanskrit language was intensively studied which in turn considerably inspired and influenced the Japanese language and literature. Its impact was so abiding that many words in Japanese language are considered to be of Indian derivation, such as zen (Skt. dhyana), biwa (Skt. vina), etc. The Japanese people in general are quite familiar with the Indian siddham letters, although they have no knowledge of Sanskrit. In fact, we often come across wooden tablets written in shittan (i.e. siddham) letters in Japanese cemeteries</page><page sequence="11">873 and in temple inscriptions beneath the images of the Buddha, the Bodhisattvas and other divinities.42 Thus Kukai's persona! contacts with the great Kashmirian acarya Prajua were to produce a profound effect on the cultural evolution of Japan. After his return to Japan from Korea he started spreading education to the common man which was till then restricted to the privileged classes, and only children of the families above the fifth rank could attend academies and universities. He established a new institution - The Institution of General Arts and Wisdom ( Shugei Shuchi-in) for children of all classes. The courses were both secular and sacred, and to democratise and propagate literacy he also invent- ed a Syllabary of Fifty Sounds ( Gojģu on) of which the basis was the Sanskrit language. He further wove the entire alphabet in to a poem, called ¡raha, referred to above, which is hased on the Mahaparinibbana sutra ,48 This new syllabary was a revolutionary step in Japan's civilization for what was hitherto the prerogative of the privileged few became the potential privilege of all. In 1126 A. D. Zen-nin, the outstanding Tendai calligrapher of siddham-nagari wrote mantras for the emperor. In Japan there is a manual used by the mantrayana- monks for learning the mudras for worship which is known as Sh/àngonmikkyo- zu-in-shu ("a collection of the drawings of mudras of mantrayana "). mudras in Japanese tradition evoke the presence of the divine in the mind of the initiate. According to the Daimchikyo (a Japanese work) mudras endow the thoughts, consecrations, mudras - all that is beyond form with a visible evanescence, to crystalize a state of meditation. In fact, all that was transmitted from Kashmir, Kanchi and Nalanda to Japan was touched by the breath of the spirit and form that is Japan 44 Even in the austerely simple lines representing Sarasvati, there is the feeling of the Japanese world of "floures and willows". This is an anthropomorphic delineation of Sarasvati on the physical plane the plane of Kayaś On the second or verbal plane (of Vak) she is calligraphed in the siddham-nagari script Thus written, the syllable lives and breathes in an adoring, admiring heart. On the final plane of the citta , she is realised as a samaye, a vow, a resolve, expressed as a fundamental form, and "form in emptiness, and emptiness in form" ( rupam èva sunyata, sunyata eva rupam).</page><page sequence="12">874 Then purity and peace, simplicity and serene become the artless aft of life.45 From an old account we learn how Shinnyo Hoshinno (priestly imperial prince) or Takao Koshinno, who was the third son of Emperor Heijo, made strenuous efforts to reach India as a pilgrim but could not succeed in his mission. He made extensive study of the religious canons and strained a very prominent position in Shingon sect. His quest for religious knowledge ultimately brought him to T'ang China in 861 A. D. whence he proceeded on a journey to India three years later at the age of seventy. "From the region of Chukiang he traversed the mountain areas of Yunnan and entered Laos" where he is reported to have been "eaten by a tiger."46 Following him another monk named Eisai tried to travel to India in the Kamakura period. Founder of the Rinzai sect in Japan, he was another great personality who was widely respected in the Japanese religious world. In 1168 A. D. he went to Sung China and stayed there for five to six months, but realising the importance of the first-hand study of Budhism he sought permission from the authorities to travel to India. He was however not permitted to go by the South Sea route and had to give up his proposed journey.47 Notwithstanding these failures the Japanese monks constantly endeavoured to make a journey to India. Eisai was followed by Myoe Shonin Koben of Taganoo who was responsible for reviving the old Kegon tradition. Since his childhood he had nourished a dream to visit India and around 1203-05 A. D , he made a special study of the travel diaries of Hiuen Tsang in order to achieve his desired goal. He spelt out a detailed plan, made exact calculations of distance and time and date when he would reach India after completing his journey but unfortunately he too had to cancel his journey owing to illness.48 When the successive attempts of the Japanese to come to India to learn the language and the teachings of the Buddha failed, they devised another method to achieve their objective. They visited China after another and made through and extensive study of the Sanskrit and Chinese languages to have a deep knowledge of the philosophy and teachings of Buddhism which were preserved in these languages in China. The Japanese zeal for learning the Sanskrit language kept "the Sanskrit lore in Japan for nearly 1,400 years in</page><page sequence="13">875 the colleges attached to the great Buddhist temples".49 The Japanese monks carried some Sanskrit texts to their countries and preserved them which "must have been brought from India or Central Asia to China and thence to Japan."50 Significantly most of these manuscripts preserved in Japan are much older than their counterparts now available in India. It is no exaggeration to say that besides the recently discovered manuscripts in Eastern Turkistan "the oldest Indian manu- scripts are to be found in Japan belonging to the first half of the sixth century."51 The Japanese syllabary, known as Kana owes its origin to the efforts of Kukai "which made possible more extensive literary work in Japanese, and in tenth century, stories, travel diaries and essays appeared written in Japanese which sometimes achieved considerable literary distinction."52 The first book of fiction or novel in Japan known as Taketori Monogatari was written in Kana in the beginning of the tenth century which "embodies the Buddhist idea of moral causation, while the materials are taken from various Buddhist works such as Jataka tales, the Gwatsujonyo, the Agon-gyo and others."88 A court-lady, Murasaki-no-Shikibu is credited with having written another moral in kana early in the eleventh century A.D. This world- famous Japanese classic depicts the court-life of the period with aesthetic life permeating the whole story intersected with Buddhist rituals and prayers of every kind."61 It is interesting to note in this connection that some stories of ancient India proved very influential in shaping Japanese stories by providing them with interesting themes which in turn were greatly modified and adapted in such a way as to suit the taste and mentality of the common people in Japan. People in early times in India commonly believed that a hare or a rabbit lived in the moon and hence the latter was also called sasin (literally 'containing a hair'). This idea influenced the ancient Japanese so much that they too in the course of time came to believe that there lived a hare in the moon which made rice-cakes and pounded cooked rice with pestle55 which is evident from the popular Japanese stories like The Fascinating Story of Monkey and His Liver and The story of Monoceros (Ekasrnga) as contained in the Sase kishu, a medieval collection of popular Japanese stories.56 We have yet another important work, Taideikf. the Ramayana of the Japanese language,57 which besides other things, narrates the</page><page sequence="14">876 story of sage Rsyasrnga. Winternitz explaining the purpose of this legend says that various versions of this legend "may be found in other Indian works of literature, especially in the Ramayana, in the Padma-Purana and in the Buddhist Jataka Book. ..But how popular this humorous tale was, is shown by its being familiar in different versions in Tibet, China and Japan, and in its having left traces behind even in the unicorn-legend of the West".5' Besides the Ramayana, Indian logic, celled fmmyo ( Hetuvidya ) was introduced in China by Hiuen Tsang (600-664 A. D.) which later found its way into Japan along with the study of Yuishiki (con- sciousness only) thought. The Japanese name for this (Indian) science of causes is Immyo-gaku. and it still continues to the present tirre in the so-called Hosso sect.69 The above pieces are more than sufficient to illustrate Indian influences on Japanese literature and other branches of learning. In fact we come across a great deal of Indian influence in Japanese classical works which have not yet been fully investigated- III Coming to sculpture we find that there are three types of image, belonging to the Asuka period (6th-7th century A.D.), the specimens of which have been found in Japan in large numbers : (i) Butsu or Nyorai (Buddha or Tathagata) images; (ii) Bosatsu (Bodhisattva) images and (iii) Ten (Deva) images. The first category is represented by the images depicting Sakyamuni after his attainment of Buddha- hood, and the representative works of this period are preserved in the Horyu-ji temple. The Bronze image of Yakushi Nyorai and Saka Trinity (Sakyamuni Triad) and a wooden statue of Yakushi Nyorai are some of the best examples of this category which bear distinct influence of Chinese style.60 The second category includes the images of Bodhisattvas or "enlightened beings" with the features Sakyamuni as Prince Sid- dhartha or Gautama, i.e , before his attainment of Buddhahood. Some of the gilt-bronze Bodhisattva images belonging to Shijuhattai Butsu - a group of fifty-two statuettes preserved in the Tokyo National Museum - are some of the best specimens of this category.</page><page sequence="15">877 The third category portray the Deva images which were regarded as guardians or protectors of the Buddha, the Boddhisattva and Buddhism.41 As we have shown above, unlike the Buddha and Boddhisattva images, the Deva images provided enough scope for the sculptors to give shape and form according to their imagination, of course, within the frame-work of religious restrictions. But, as they were treated as protectors or guardian deities, their forms and features resemble those of persons having martial characteristics, i.e , warriors. We have wooden Shi-Tonno or 'Four Deva Kings' preserved in the Golden Hall of the Horyu-ji temple,92 besides the images of the Buddha. Images of the Buddha and the guardian deities, i e., Brahmani- cai gods and goddess, belonging to the Nara period (645-794 A D.) are preserved in large numbers in various, temples and museums of Japan and unlike the Asuka period the materials used in this period covered besides wood and gilt, bronze, copper, lacquer, stone, clay, etc.63 In almost all sculptures of this (early Nara) period, the Gupta style is remarkably pronounced. The Japanese sculptors followed the i-tyle developed during the reign period of the T'ang dynasty in China (618-906 A. D.) which was greatly influenced by the Gupta style of Indian art.64 The Chinese art absorbed and assimi- lated the Gupta style with which it came into direct contact through the images and paintings and sutras which Hiuen Tsang had brought to China after his long stay in India.65 During this period Japan maintained regular contacts with China through Japanese monks, students and artists, who visited China, and the Chinese artists who visited Japan which ultimately resulted in the emergence of new forms and style in Japanese sculpture. The Buddha images of the Gupta period are so similar in iconographie details to the images of the Shaka-Muni (Sak^amuni) of Japan of the early Nara period that sometimes it is very difficult to distinguish between the two if placed side by side.66 The bronze statue of Kannon Botatsu (Avalokitesvara) in the Yakushi ji temple bears distinct influence of the Gupta style of sculpture. The Chinese sculptures of this period have certain characteristics- such as erectness of the body with realistic proportion, roundess of the body, beautiful curved lines of drapery, an impression of 'wet clothing around the body, narrow</page><page sequence="16">878 waist, the majestic and graceful posture, etc.- which are also the main features of the Gupta School of art. These elements of the Gupta School found their way into Japan through China, and thus "the art of the Early Nara period was essentially the Gupta style of Central India, seasoned with the Chinese style of the Sui and Early Tang dynasties. This influence is specially obvious in sculpture".*7 In the later period, however, the features of the Gupta style became less noticeable with the emergence of a distinctively Japanese style.68 We have the largest existing wonderful bronze image of the Great Buddha (Daibutsu) in Todai-ji temple in NaraG9 the like of which has not been seen so far in any other part of the world. Images of the Brahmanical female deities came to be made for the first time during this period in Japan. We have clayfigures of Sri Devi or Laksmi (Kichijo-ten) and a clay-image of eight-armed Sarasvati (Benzai-ten) in Horyu-ji and Todai-ji temples which are supposed to be the best examples of female divinities worshipped widely during this (Nara) period. Even today Kichijo-ten or Mahasridevi Laksmi is worshipped as the honzon or "principal object of adoration" with supplication of good fortunes at Yakushi-ji. The painting done on fine hemp belongs to the Nara period of whose the first ceremony was held in 727 A. D. While this painting is "like the fragrance of a blooming flower" of Shin- Yakushi-ji, we also find aesthetic vigour and vitality in the image of Basara, one of the Twelve Dharmapalas. In fact, the cold clay has been brought to life to pulsate with the hot blood of anger : bhisanam bhisa nanam. A few yards from this place is the Toshodai- ji monastery which still bears the aura of classical times. The array of statues in the Kondo (Golden Hall) of the temple expresses the power and grace, of the pantheon, with Birushava (Vairocana) seated in the centre, while the wooden figures of Brahma, Indra and four Lokapalas make an imposing phalanx of statues. The Diabutsu-den or "the Hall of the Great Buddha" of the Todai-ji monastery enshrines yet another gigantic statue of Vairocana (virata rupa) of the eighth century A. D., which was consecrated on 9 April 752 A. D. in a sumptuous ceremony. It was presided over by Bodhisena the first historic Indian to have visited Japan. A Brahmana of the Bharadvaja gotta he was inspired by Manjusri to visit the Wu-</page><page sequence="17">879 ta'ishan mountain in China. He arrived in Japan at the invitation of the emperor in 736 A. D. where he was warmly welcomed. He came to be renowned as Brahmana (Baramon) Archbishop- On his enter- ing samadhi on 25 February 760 his disciple Shuei wrote, "On his death we felt as though the main props of the house were broken and we deplored, we could hear his virtuous voice no more. His wisdom, vast as the ocean, always pours over us without being dried up". In this temple consecrated by the Brahmana Archbishop we can view the expressive range of Nara sculptures of Brahma, Indra, Catur-Lokapala, Surya, Candra, Sarasvati and Sri Laksmi which have escaped the ravages of fire. The world's largest statue in the world's largest wooden building was intended to express a spirit of devotion in all its grandeur and magnificence, and at the same time to give concrete embodiment to national solidarity of all classes of the popu- lation, and it was a major step towards the démocratisation of the Dharma. We have even today in the Todai-ji and other monasteries and museums of Japan masks used in the Bugaku or Gagaku dance and music which was introduced to Japan by the great Bodhisenar. The masks are of various kinds such as masks of Baramon (Brahmana), Garuda, Sagaranagaraja. Yaksa' Indra, Brahma, Surya, Kubera, Agni, Vasistha, Isvara, Laksmi and other used in dances performed in temples and the Imperial Palace at bouquets. These forms have been preserved as ceremonial dances for national celebrations. Some of the music pieces pertain to Bhairo Bhairava. Besides these, we have in the Kofuku-ji temple (of Nara period) the portrait-like features of the two outstanding Indian philosophers- Vasubandhu (Jap : Seishin) and Asanga (Jap : Muchaku ) which no doubt constitute the master- pieces of the great sculptor Unkei. The Jingo-ji temple is yet another remarkable sculptural brilliance which combines in it the metaphsics and mystery, symbolism and deep intellectual penetration of the mantrayana (Mikkyo). The main deity is Yakushi Nyorai or Bhaisajyaguru casting on the devotees a broding spiritual awareness. The esoteric images of the Five Bodhi- sattvas exude the mystery which resides in beauty itself. An Indian is struck by the presence of a special hall for the Homa (Jap : Goma) ceremony in the Jingo-ji temple where the blazing fires were the</page><page sequence="18">880 wisdom which destroys abstacles to salvation. We have also here a special temple consecrated to the esoteric Twin Ganesa in whose honour ceremonies are held twice a year even to day. The Muro-ji temple was famous for the mandala of Indra as the lord of rainfall, painted on a wooden wall at the back of the main sanctum. The holy lake at Muro-ji is shaped like the Nagari letter vam, representing Vairocana, the prime principle of the universe for crossing over from samsara into nirvana Moreover, the twenty-one statues in the lecture- hall at Toji (or Eastern Temple) arranged in a mandata paradigm are an impressive monument to a ceremony that was performed in the ninth century for the well-being of the country. Among them are the imposing statues of Brahma, Skanda-Karttikeya, Sarasvati and others, besides deities of ferocious appearance whose profound and mysteri- ous sculptures radiate irresistible power. This monastery has pre- served the oldest Gyodo masks employed in ceremonial dances, for instance, the masks for Brahma, Indra, Surya, Kubera, Agni, Vasu and Isvara. The Golden Pavilion (Kinkaku) of Rokuon-ji temple near Kyoto was the semi-hermitage of Ashikaga Shogun Yoshimitsu, a zen mork. A picturesque pavilion sitting in the pond, it lends grace to the garden of the temple, where arises the ethereal pavilion of nirvana overlook- ing the ocean of existence ( bhavasagara ), recalling at once the Golden Temple of Amritsar in the centre of the pond which is the emergence of Brahma from the primal waters. The Kasuga shrine dedicated to the protective deities of Kofuki-ji is a colourful display of vermilion and green on the slope of the mountain. The Indian dance and music of Bugaku has been handed down to this day in a continuous tradition in all its impressive elegance and elan, conveying the audacity and boldness of its foun- ders, the Fujiwara family. In fact the worship of Brahmanical female-deities was introduced in accordance with the guide-lines laid down in the Suvarna-Prabhasa Sutra ( Konko mya kyo ), a highly revered religious text of the period.70 The Shi-Tenno (Four Guardian Deities) images of the Taima Dera in Nara displaying less violently angry disposition and the Shi- Tenno images of the later Nara period, depicting raging anger, and preserved in the Jiki-do (refectory), are supposed to be the repre-</page><page sequence="19">881 sentative specimens of this period.71 The oldest extant image of Indra (Taishaku-ten) and Brahma (Bon-ten) made of clay are also preserved In the refectory of the Horyu-ji temple in Nara.72 The image of Vajra- pani (Ni-O; is a bronze relief plaque at the Hasedera (Nara Prefecture) made in 686 A.D.7' Some of the famous pieces of sculpture of this period include the dry- lacquer statues of Karura or Garuda and the six-armed asura or asura as well as the clay image of Bakira Taisho, one of the Twelve Guardians of Yakushi Nyorai. The new Buddhist doctrines of the Tendai and Shingon sects propounded in the following period (Heian period : 794- 1185 A.D.) brought about revolutionary changes in iconographie forms and features of the Buddhist and Brahmanical deities in Japan with more and more emphasis on art in order to express divine power. To the already existing pantheon of Buddhist and Brahmanical deities in Japan were added the interesting images of the fierce Myo-o (Raja), regarded as "the manifestation of Dainichi's divine wrath against evil".7* Many of these terrific beings later came to be "absorbed into Buddhism from the Hindu and other religions"75, and they were popularly believed to be the symbolic representations of "Buddha power".76 The images of this period are mostly symbolic and mystic depicting the spiritual and physical strength of the esoteric divinities. They were made in strict accordance with scriptural guidelines leaving little or no scope for the artists to give free play to his ideas or imagination.77 The important Buddhist deities of Brahmanical origin of this period comprise Shi-Tenno (Four Guardian kings or deities), Bonten (Brahma) and Taishaku-ten (Indra) of the To ji temple. The forms and images of the deities of this period are iconogra- phically completely different from those of the preceding period. For instance, Bon-ten (Brahma) is now represented with four heads, the main head having three eyes, and four arms riding a group of four geese and Taishaku-ten (Indra) is depicted with one-head having three eyes and two arms, riding gracefully his charming white elephant (airavata). These two images "reveal the purely Indian aesthetic aspect of Kukai's importation" from China.78 Another great event in the history of Japanese iconography occurred towards the end of the early Heian period which witnessed the making of images of Shinto gods and goddesses after the Buddhist and Brahmanical models.</page><page sequence="20">882 There was no place for icons originally in Shintoinm but it could not escape the all-pervading powerful influences of Buddhism. In fact, this period marked the completion of the process of the introduction of Buddhist deities of Brahmanical origin, and in the succceding ages they came to be represented both in sculptures and paintings and were worshipped with equal reverence. This is further confirmed by a large number of comparatively old representations of Brahmanical gods and goddesses in extant Japanese sculptures and paintings, pointing unmistakably to the widespread prevalence and popularity of these deities. It is however interesting to note that bronze and stone sculptures of Brahmanical deities are very few in number. We have generally wooden sculptures of Juni-ten (Twelve Guardian Deities : viz. India, Brahma, Varuna, Yama, Agni, Yavu, Vaisrasavana Isana, Prthvi, Surya, Candra and Raksasa), of Shi-Tenno (or Caturmaharaja such as Dhrtarastra, Virudhaka, Virupaksa and Yaisravana) and of individual deities like Indra, Brahma, Yama, Varuna, Ganesa, Sarasvati and Laksmi. Besides the wooden structures, we have also figures of Brahma, Sarasvati, Laksmi and other deities in clay sculptures and of Indra, Brahma, asura and others in dry lacquer sculptures.70 Of the Brahmanical deities, Ganesa is probably the only god represented always in bronze sculptures and, as we have noted earlier, all these painted and sculptured representations of Brahmanical deities are carefully preserved and worshipped in Japanese temples and shrines. IV Paintings belonging to pre-Buddhist period in Japan are almost rare and the few specimens that exist today are of purely primitive character.80 By no stretch of imagination can it be said that the incised decorative patterns on the Tomon potteries and the line-relief drawings on various antiquities of the Yayoi period are real paintings. In the Kofun period, however, creative imagination found expression in the form of wall paintings as well as drawings of various types of pictures which have been discovered in the burial mounds 81 The art of painting was introduced in Japan in the Asuka period by the Koreans which was modelled on the Chinese style, developed mainly in China during the Six Dynasties (265-589 A D) and the</page><page sequence="21">883 Sui Dynasty (581 - 618 A. D.).8a During this period volumes of religious paintings are said to have been done in Japan by foreign painters83, but the only extant specimens of these paintings can now be seen on the side walls of a miniature Buddhist shrine, known as Tamamushi-no-Zushi (Beetle-wing shrine or Tamamushi shrine), preserved in the Horjuji temple, and a fragment of Tenjukoku Mandara (or Paradise Mandala) made on an underpainting or drawing, done by some women painters, depicting Prince Shotoku's rebirth in heaven81. The paintings of Tamamushi shrine are of immense significance. While they are the earliest specimens of Japanese paintings of the post-archaic age85, they also furnish the only example depicting Brahmanical deities, for the first time, which are at the same time •'the earliest oil paintings in the world".86 The portable Tamamushi shrine, measuring only 65x35.5 cm. at the base but with a height of 233 cm., is a fine example of highly skilled lacquer and metal work, constructed in the late sixth or early seventh century, and now preserved in the Horyuji temple's Treasure House.87 The lower part of this shrine, resting on Sumeru pedastai, has four paintings on its four faces, all the themes drawn from the Mahaparinirvana Sutra and the Suvarnaprabhasa Sutra. We have also a scene from the famous Jataka story depicting the Buddha in one of his previous births as Bodhisattva ( Brahma-prabha ) on the left-side painting, while on the right side the painting in a narrative style depicting the Buddha In one of his previous births as a Brahmana ascetic98. We have also painted figures of two guardian deities (Ni- O) on the front door leaves in the upper portion of the Tamamushi shrine, originally belonging to Hindu pantheon.88 The three actions depicted succes- sively in the story of Brahmaprabha and the four actions represented progressively in the story of a Brahmana and Indra are highly interes- ting"80 considering the method of representation. Japanese scholars generally agree that this particular mode of depiction of various actions in progressive order on one surface is not of Japanese origin and "was probably invented in India"81 The Japanese scroll pain- tings of the succeeding period betray unmistakable influence of this mode of depiction which in a sense came to stay as one of its funda- mental principles.92 Thus, the influence of the Tamamushi shrine</page><page sequence="22">884 paintings may be regarded as exceedingly important in the develop- ment of Japanese painting which owes its style to the Tamamushi shrine paintings. The paintings on a miniature shrine, known as Lady Tachibana's shrine (670-680 A D.), are the earliest specimens of the Nara period depicting the pictures of the Buddha, the Bodhisattvas, Shi-Tenno (Four Guardian Kings) and Ni-0 (benevolent kings). The style and technique of painting on the pedastai resembling closely the frescos on the walls of the Golden Hall of the Horyuji temple, is almost similar to that of the Ajanta cave painting.93 Few monuments in the history of world art have attracted more attention of the writers than the Horyuji temple. "Historically minded monks who served it, literate pilgrims and travellers of the Middle Ages, ninteenth and twentieth century romantics and scholars have all been contributors to this surfeit of literature, and the special position the temple has assumed in the minds of westerners as Japan took the plunge into Buddhist art, has added somewhat more measurably to the countless volumes, articles and written comments which make up this ceaseless stream"®4 The murals stand at the eastern terminus of a long tradition which has its origin in Indian wall paintings as illustrated at Ajanta. The history of the Horyuji is inseparable from the earliest attempts to make Buddhism a working religious system at the court through the efforts of Prince Shotoku, the founder of the temple. Scholars generally believe that somewhere around 710 A. D the walls of the Main Hall of the Horyuji temple received their paintings. But, the architecture of the present temple - which embodies typical archite- ctural features of the Asuka period- is "in the style of at least one generation earlier".95 However, newly introduced architectural ideas, probably first used at the Yakushi jiin 680 A D.96, or at least before 700 A. D., makes by comparison, the Horyuji's style look so early. It is generally believed that by the end of the Nara period or the beginning of the Heian period, the Saka triad97 was respectfully ensconced as the chief image in the Main Hall98. But, the style of the murals adorning the Kondo or Golden Hall of the Horyuji has close affinities to those of India and its special significance lies in reflecting the artistic achievements of seventh century India. We are</page><page sequence="23">885 told that in A. D. 643-46, 648-49 and 657-661 the entourage of the Chinese envoy Wan Hsuan-tse had copied the frescoes from the walls of monasteries in Bihar. Later on, these paintings were compiled in forty volumes some of which were taken to Japan by the Korean artist Honjitsu which were adopted as models for the Horyuji murals. The overriding impression of the wall-paintings is "one of a series of murals with no forerunners in Japan and no comparable successors."*8 Yet it can not be denied that all the Buddhas such as Saka, Amida, Yakushi and Miroku (Maitreya) selected for use at this time on the walls were already well established figures in Japanese iconography and they continued to be used while esoteric practices in the Heian period tended to divert attention to other types.100 According to Haruyama, the colour scheme in the Horyuji is similar to Indian colour scheme, and the reds and greens as the two chief colours, were used symmetrically along with the obvious symmetry of grouped figures within each large panel.101 As regards colour, "the Indianness comes out in the reddish brown of most lines while black may occasionally be seen, and the Buddha panel 10 is done with yellow drapery lines."10* Haruyama points out that the colouring methods and shading, in as much as the latter emphasised three dimensionality, are close to Ajanta.10' Similarly, the differences bet- ween Horyuji and Ajanta are equally striking : "the consistent simp- licity of the Japanese groups, ideally balanced and essentially static compositions, inverse rather than parallel line perspective, are all factors which were modified over the intervening time and space separating the two, filtered through the leaven of China',104 We all know that the Ajanta paintings were done over a consi- derable period of time, and a comparative study of the Horyu-ji murals with the Ajanta paintings can be based only on paintings in sixth and seventh century caves of the latter. The Horyuji murals were the work of a small number of painters who might have finished within a few months or even a few weeks. While some of the Ajanta paintings are inscribed, the Horyuji paintings are not. The emphasis on scenes from the life of the Buddha and Jataka stories at Ajanta encourages the liveliness and informality associative with a narrative content. This fundamental difference in subject-matter renders it difficult to make a comparative study of most of the cave-paintings. However</page><page sequence="24">886 Cave 16 does have a formal arrangement which could have served as the proto-type for Tun-huang and other paradises,105 and the Horyuji paintings are linked with India through Tun-huang in northwest China both geographically and iconographically. These world famous murals of the Horyuji were damaged in a fire in 1949 with the result that only small portions of the paintings are now visible in highly discoloured form. The Buddhas and the Bodhisattvas were painted on the walls which also contained the beautiful paintings by flying apsaras and arhats. One could easily discern the Indian elements contained in these murals which owe their origin to the forceful influences and inspiration from India and Central Asian paintings through the paintings of the Tang dynasty.106 The painting of Sri Devi or Laksmi (Kichij ten), now preserved in Yakushiji temple107 is yet another most representative example of this period. The Shoso-in, popularly known as the store-house of Japan's ancient treasures (at Nara), contains a rich collection of art objects of this period108 which are unique in many respects. These objects exhibit a tendency towards realism while those of the previous period are remarkable for symbolism, abstraction and lack of realism. In other words, the art of the Nara period showed realistic approach as well as refined and polished representation 109 The Heian period in the history of Japan may be termed as a glorious era of Buddhist paintings. The establishment of esoteric Buddhism gave birth to various esoteric ceremonies and different deities, with altars decorated with different images, which ultimately resulted in the production of a large number of paintings.110 Moreover the geometrical diagrams called mandaras which were brought by Kukai from China consisted of innumerable paintings of Buddhist deities, many of them having Brahmanical origion. This gave further impetus to paintings based on Mandara models.111 Besides these, paintings of icons with angry faces or fearful appearances became a craze with the painters of this period, the most notable examples being the paintings of Myo-0 figures and of Juni-ten (Twelve Guar- dian Deities). It was in this sge that the process of introducing new Buddhist deities of Brahmanical origin was completed, and they now came to be represented both in sculptures and paintings in the succeeding periods and were worshipped with equal reverence.111</page><page sequence="25">887 We have a large number of representations of Brahmanical gods and goddesses in old Japanese paintings and sculptures, meant for worship in temples, which unmistakably vouchsafe for widespread and popularity of these deities.113 The door-panels and walls of mini- ture shrines contain paintaings which also form part of murals on wooden pillars of temples. The Mandaras ( Mandatas ) constitute bigger painted scrolls, generally on silk, and hung on temple walls, often portraying figures of Brahmanical gods and goddesses. Moreover, we have representation of individual, or group of Brahmanical deities in paintings of different kinds, such as eight-armed Sarasvati, and Hariti appearing in a panel of the Kichijo-ten Zushi (Laksmi); painted representation of Indra in Tamamushi shrine and figures of Shi-Tenno (Four Guardian Deites) on the door of Lady Tachibana's shrine. We have many painted representations of Yama and Laksmi on silk and hemp cloth, images of the Twelve Guardian Deities and also some Brahmanical deities in murals. Besides these, various Brahmanical gods and goddesses are seen among the Buddhist divinities in Takao, Shingon-in, Kojima and other mandaras : for instance, Juni-ten mandara showing figures of Twelve Guardian Deities and Taishoku- ten mandara portraying Indra and other attendant deities. Indra also figures in paintings in the Tamamushi shrine, the Kaidon-in hall of the Todai-ji temple and the Joruri-ji temple, in addition to his various images made in the refectory of the Horyu-ji temple along with his famous vajra (thunder-bolt).114 The lively painting of Bon-ten (Brahma) in To-ji temple at Kyoto is another remarkable feat in this series. Portrayed on the panel of a pair of six-fold screens as one of the Juni-ten (Twelve Deva Kings or Guar- dian Deities) in colours on silk, this arid other images of this set were painted by Takuma Shoga in 1191 A.D. for use at a religious service. The four headed and four-armed ¡mage of Brahma vividly portrayed in bright colours stands on a lotus pedestal with a long trident in one of the left hands and the other left holding a longish pot ( Kamandalu ). The most striking feature of this presentation is that each of its four faces bears the third eye placed vertically on the forehead.115 Varuna the water-god also figures in some of the paintings in Japanese shrines. There is a ninth century painting of Sin-ten (Varuna) in colour, depicted as one of the Twelve Guardian Deities in Saidai ji temple in Nara. Seated on a large tortoise and wearing a crown</page><page sequence="26">888 decorated with the figures of five dragons he is represented as "the god of seas and rivers". We have yet another coloured painting of Varuna done on a piece of silk and kept in the To-ji temple in Kyoto. It is decorated with ornaments and is no doubt a fine piece of painting. Another important piece of painting we have is the very old painted image of Nit-ten (SuryaJ which is preserved in the Jingo- ji temple and is depicted without any mount. The most interesting point to remember about this god is that while he is considered to be a goddess in Shinto conception, he is very much a masculine god in Japanese Buddhism. However, Jin-ten or Prthvi is the earth-god (not goddess) in Japanese Buddhism. The esoteric images of Five Bodhisattvas exude the mystery which resides in beauty itself. The gigantic paintings of the two cosmograms or mandatas of Mahakaru- nagarbha-dhatu and Vajra-dhatu in gold and silver on purple damask, coordinate the esoteric traditions of the ancient Indian universities of Nalanda in the north and Kanchi in the South. Sho-ten or Ganesa or Vinayaka seems to have been a very popular god in Japan who, like other Brahmanical deities, reached there through China. We have various kinds of Vinayakas painted in the outer frame of Ryokai Mandara. Six kinds of Vinayakas are arranged in four different directions on the outer hall of Kongokai Mandara and are variously known as Kongosai-ten or Sangai Vinayaka, Onjiki-ten or Kemon Vinayaka, Kongoi-ten or Kakyusen Vinayaka, Kongo-chobuku-ten or Chofuku-ten or Kuto Vinayaka and Kangi-ten or Vinayaka-ten- all elephant-headed gods. We have also mention of a pig-headed Vinayaka, called Ito-ben who appears in the northern side of the outer hall of Kongo- Kai.116 One interesting aspect of this Vinayaka legend in Japan is the depiction of his ima- ges in eight forms, not to be found in India, such as (i) a single elephant- headed image with two arms, (ii) a single elephant headed image with four arms, (iii) a single elephant headed image with six arms, (iv) a single elephant-headed image with three faces and four arms, (v) a single human headed two-armed image with an ele- phant's head (or sometimes dragon's head) in the crown, (vi) twin elephant-headed images in an embracing pose, (vii) twin images, one with usual elephant's head and the other with the head of a boqr and (viii) a single pig-headed images.117 While in India Ganesa is</page><page sequence="27">889 regarded as the God of Learning, in Japan it is popularly believed that the devotees of Ganesa or Vinayaka gain wealth. And, this belief makes the merchants and businessmen flock to the shrines of this god and invoke his blessings. In Osaka we have the biggest temple of Sho-ten which attracts a large number of people every day for offering worship. Sarasvati, the goddess of learning, music and fine arts, is also regarded as the goddess of good luck and plenty in Japan and figures in many of the paintings in different forms. We have a pecu- liar image of Ben-ten or Benzai-ten (Sarasvati) preserved in a temple at Kamakura, depicted as a coiled snake with a thinly bearded human head, resting on the back of a figure looking like frog.118 Yet another very interesting painting depicts a three headed Ben-ten with a body of a serpent, said to have originally belonged to a temple in Kyoto.119 The figure on the crown has a body of a white snake with its face resembling that of an old man. This unusual associa- tion of snake with Sarasvati is attributed to the popular Indian belief that the snake is an aquatic animal and the king of dragons lives in the sea. As a result of this age-old belief Sarasvati came to be wor- shipped in Japan as the Goddess of River and her image is generally installed in temples beside a river or lake or pond, and the snake is supposed to be the messenger of Benzai-ten.M# V The school of meditative or Dhyana Buddism produced perhaps the greatest influence on Japanese art. This is popularly known in Japan as Zen Buddhism which reached Japan from China, proved in the course of time extremely popular and influenced many aspects of Japanese life. Zen Buddhism emphasised that true enlightment could be achieved only by sudden illumination which would over- come the believer like a flash of lightening. The artists following this ideal worked rapidly, and out of the depth of their subconscious, not by painstaking and careful execution of the image. The result is a type of painting which is free and spontaneous giving vivid expre- ssion to the Zen way of experiencing reality. The Zen painters chose subjects mostly derived from Buddhist stories, and many of the saintly figures depicted are very simple men."1 Although on the suiface a very simple painting stated in the most economical of terms, it</page><page sequence="28">890 embodies the most profound of Zen insights giving expression to the doctrine which exists outside of all doctrinal teaching and does not depend on letters or words but points directly to the mind. The wonderful art of Ikebana which means putting living plants in water is to love flowers as living beings and to tend them with kind feelings. The Japanese bow before the flowers after arranging them. An aesthetic creation, it was the essence of life itself, perva- ded by the warmth of the human heart, whereby one gives expression on the universal heat. The Japanese tradition speaks of "Indian monks who, in their universal love, were the first to pick up plants injured by the storm or parched by the heat, in order to tend them with compassion and endeavour to keep them alive".1" While they developed different trends and schools of flower-arrangement, the fine feeling for form and the "three main lines" as the foundation remained constant, which correspond to the tribhanga in Indian art. In the course of time the ceremony of incense burning added to the essence of the spiritual discipline which a budding flower and a few leaves inculcated. The clouds of incense, the gracefully created form, a profound thought calligraphed on a scroll by the hand of a Master were the Zen expression of the pancopacara where in puspa and dhupa had a core role : so that man may be touched by the deeds of life itself. 188 The sounds of even tide are the vibrations of the temple bell as it rings the 108 peals for the 108 passions that bind beings to this phenomenal world The bell itself stands for impermanence ; "the sound which it peals forth is perishable; it is perceived but it may not be kept. The phenomenal world is like the sound of the bell, it is perceived but it may not be kept.124 The above survey would thus show that though India exercised a great and abiding influence on Japanese life and culture there was not much direct contact between the two countries as such. The influence of Indian culture upon Japan was great and there is no need to treat in detail the role of Buddhism and its philosophy which is so well known. In addition to this, one could, as shown above, bring up such things as studies of the similarity between Japanese stories and Indian stories, the Indian gods that are made the objects of worship in Japanese folk-beliefs and Indian words used in Japan. Pespite the great distance and natural barriers between India and</page><page sequence="29">891 East Asian countries, cultural exchange on such a large scale is truly a fact in world history that merits admiration. By means of this fact we can understand how an East Asian World, with its centre at T'ang came into being, and through the mediacy of Buddhist culture went on to become linked into a unity. In a sense, "Japan may be said to owe everything to India, for from India came Buddhism, and Buddhi- sm brought civilization- Chinese Civilization; but then China had been far more deeply tinged with the Indian dye than is generally admitted even by the Chinese themselves".118 It has been rightly pointed out that the question of Indian influence on Japan is "vast and somewhat obscure"126 of which no proper assessment has been attempted so far.
