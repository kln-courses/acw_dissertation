Harmonds- worth: Penguin Books, 1971. 35P Ecstatic religion seeks to 'explore that most decisive and profound of all religious dramas, the seizure of man by divinity' (p. 18). It is good functionalist sociology at its best. The main thesis is impliedly derived from a union of Gluckman's 'rituals of rebellion' and Aberle's ' relative deprivation '. The social context of religious ecstasy is discovered in the relationship between the established and disadvantaged, where the latter, so often women in male-dominated societies, employ states of possession or trance as ritual protests which, since the values of the ecstasy are shared, can winkle concession from the established. If thus, the 'most decisive and profound of all religious dramas' seems but a squeaky wheel, the truth seems to be that Lewis is not exploring religious ecstasy but, as often happens in functionalist sociology, some of the protest rituals of some of the relatively deprived. Going on, Lewis dis- tinguishes three broadly based contexts with- in which these particular kinds of ritual protest take place: a) Where values are shared, but only the disadvantaged employ ecstasy; b) Where the values do not turn out to be shared, the ecstasy leads to a breakaway group-messianisms, millenarisms, enthusi- asms and such; c) Where ecstasy is employed by the established and others as a moral reinforcement of the decision-making process. Now, had Lewis seen these contexts not as a typology but within a historical perspective- which is distinct from the culling of historical instances, of which there are plenty in the book-or even as an evolutionary series, he might have perceived that the kinds of activity he isolates are closely related to an increasing complexity and differentiation in the division of labour and social organisation. That is, he would have given 'protest' a genuine and significant context instead of mak- ing protest seem a trivial matter of wanting more cake. Among a number of authors berated for not being functionalist sociologists, two in particular may be noticed. It has become fashionable to take a whack at Frazer, and Lewis does not disappoint. But when a book is as thoroughly Frazerian as this one, both as to presentation and language-for example (p. 75): 'As elsewhere in Islam, Somalis believe that anthropomorphic finns lurk in every dark and empty corner, poised ready to strike capriciously and without warning at the unsuspecting passer-by...' one wonders how much tongue Lewis has in his cheek. With Levi-Strauss the irony is rather different. Enthusiasts will laugh incredulously at the wigging he gets. For, whatever else it is religious ecstasy is par excellence a transforma- tional process or experience-ask any sober pentecostalist. And it is this, the transforma- tional grammar of social facts that Levi- Strauss has ceaselessly, if evidently not always persuasively, tried to demonstrate. What a pity ! I have said that this book is good function- alist sociology at its best. And I mean it. There is much here that is truly excellent- the general discussion of ecstasy, for example, the different kinds of possession that are dis- tinguished, and the ways in which possession is linked to witchcraft and sorcery. The final chapter on psychology is useful-but no more. But were Malinowski and Radcliffe- Brown so charismatic that, after fifty years, the best in British sociology cannot transcend them? K. O. L.
