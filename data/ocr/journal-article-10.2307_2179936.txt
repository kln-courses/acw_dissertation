<plain_text><page sequence="1">DESCRIPTIVE NOTICES The Chinese Renaissance. The Haskell Lectures, I933. By Hu SHIn. Chica- go, The University of Chicago Press, I934. PP. xii, IIO. Anyone who wishes an illuminating and suggestive interpretation of the main forces that are remolding Chinese culture at the present time will find what he wants in this little book. The author is China's best known living philosopher, and his discussion is marked by breadth and catholicity of understanding as well as by the freshness and vividness made possible by hiss own participation in several of the movements treated. After an analysis of the distinctive attitudes of Chinese culture and a historical summary of its relations with the western world, Dr. Hu discusses in successive chapters the transformations now under way in the fields of letters, education, religion and morals. The reader's only regret is the narrow compass into which each of these treatments is compressed, rendered necessary by the limitations of time when the lectures were delivered, and by the many subsequent demands upon the author which prevented expansion of the material in its published form. E. A. BURTT CORNELL UNIVERSITY Deutsche Rechtserneuung und Rechtsphilosophie. Von KARL LARENZ. Tuibingen, J. C. B. Mohr, I934. PP. 44. This lecture attempts to state the revolution in law and the philosophy of law produced by the success of the Nazi Party in Germany. Negatively the Nazi revolution is to undo the work of the French Revolution. In politics it is to displace liberalism and individualism; in legal philosophy it is to expunge the effects of natural law and of positivism (Hans Kelsen). It develops tendencies already begun in romanticism, in the romanticized logic of Hegel, in the historical school of jurisprudence, and in Gierke's theory of the state's personality. From the Nazi point of view law is in essence the will of the community, manifested ultimately in the will of the Fiihrer. For the ideals of freedom and equality it substitutes those of membership in a race and community. It imputes rights not to persons but to their stations in the community, and in criminal law it revives the principle of retaliation as signifying the moral right of the community to hold the individual responsible. GEORGE H. SABINE CORNELL UNIVERSITY Philosophy of Society. Papers read at the Ninth Annual Meeting, American Catholic Philosophical Association. Edited by CHARLES S. HART. Phila- delphia, The Dolphin Press, I934. Pp. XII, 204. The symposium, the results of which are embodied in the present volume, had as its chief aim the ascertainment of "those more fundamental aspects or basic principles of human relations which the various social sciences as- sume". With such an end in view the contributors investigated problems ranging from the social theory of St. Thomas Aquinas to the philosophic interpretations of capitalism, communism and fascism, and modern value- 604</page><page sequence="2">DESCRIPTIVE NOTICES 605 theories. In spite of the unity of tone that the various contributions receive from a common acceptance of certain traditional dogmas and from a com- mon appeal to the authority of St. Thomas and the Pope, the papers differ very greatly, not merely in regard to subject-matter and to form, but also, and perhaps even more, in regard to merit. The ablest of the papers, at least in the eyes of the present reviewer, is one entitled "Education in a Philosophy of Society", contributed by Dr. George Johnson, of the Department of Edu- cation, The Catholic University of America-a brief but exceptionally able analysis of present educational problems that pleads for a more cultural, a more generalized and a more social-minded education than our present one. This paper by itself makes the present work worthy of a circulation far beyond the borders of the Catholic church. If Dr. Johnson's paper is the ablest of the fourteen contributions, Dr. Leo R. Ward, of the Department of Philosophy of the University of Notre Dame, may well be said to have contributed the most original one. This paper, entitled "Search for a Usable Concept of Value", presents an ingenious and interesting, yet, to my mind at least, quite unconvincing, argument in favor of the view that the prob- lem of defining value is philosophically trivial, and that most of the difficulties of modern axiology would vanish if the concepts of being and perfection were to be substituted for that of value. This paper should be of interest to all who are concerned with general axiology, no matter what views they may hold on the subject. Reference to the twelve remaining papers is, unfortunately, forbidden by lack of space. SVEN NILSON HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT Logical Positivism and Analysis. By L. SUSAN STEBBING. Annual Philoso- phical Lecture, Henriette Hertz Trust, British Academy, I933. From the Proceedings of the British Academy, Vol. XIX. Oxford, Oxford Univer- sity Press, I934. Miss Stebbing describes (I) certain respects in which the work of Witt- genstein and the so-called logical positivists is homogeneous with that of other philosophers, particularly G. E. Moore; (2) certain respects in which she finds the procedure of the "logical positivists" to be confused (most of these latter, respects in which their procedure diverges from Moore's). Under (I) Miss Stebbing might have noted filiations, not only to Moore and Russell, but to many of the great figures in the history of philosophy, beginning with Socrates. Under (2) Miss Stebbing's criticism suffers from the fact that it is by no means clear (as she herself admits) whether the "positivists" (particularly Wittgenstein) hold the views she *criticizes. To choose a single example, she supposes (35) that the "positivists" commit themselves to subjectivism and solipsism by identifying "facts' with "my experience of facts", and by failing consequently to distinguish the verifica- tion of a proposition from what makes it true. To take such criticism seriously would require us to suppose that terms like "my" and "experience" (26 f.) have no "grammar", either in ordinary discourse or else in the state- ments of the "positivists"-that is, in one or other of these usages are not words at all. In her own proposals Miss Stebbing employs such notions as those of "knowing hypothetical facts" (32), of "basic facts" (32), of</page><page sequence="3">6o6 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIV. propositions of which we know the truth but not the meaning-notions which, in their contexts, may be suspected of the sort of confusion she regrets in the writings of the "positivists". Miss Stebbing's whole interpretation rests on the assumption that the "logical positivists" hold a philosophical theory (4). This assumption needs a good deal of examination and defense, since most of the "logical positivists" not only deny it, but regard as basic the insight that there are no propositions or theories which, as philosophical, are distinguished in kind from scientific statements of, or hypotheses with respect to, facts. WILLIAM R. DENNES UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA The Categories of Charles Peirce. By EUGENE FREEMAN. Chicago, The Open Court Publishing Company, I934. Pp. vi, 62. Mr. Freeman collates, and gives an instructive interpretation of, Peirce's fundamental statements on the categories of Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness-categories "rooted in his symbolic logic, supporting his esthetics and ethics, spreading out in the firm branches of his descriptive logic, and blossoming into the flowers of his metaphysics . . ." (I3). He distinguishes Peirce's attempted a priori derivation of the categories by and from logic, and his "verification" of them by application to phenomenal experience. He asserts that, by combining these two procedures, Peirce approached a "mathematical empiricism", a possible development of which Freeman out- lines in terms of his own scheme of "Categoriology" and "Orientics" as ''resting upon a prior science" which he terms "Specifics". Even Mr. Freeman's excellent interpretation will probably not remove, for many readers, the confusion that seems to vitiate such notions as those (I) that logical form is necessary a priori and yet is a special sort of form which excludes some conceivable structures (and hence that the adjective 'mathematical' is critically significant in 'mathematical empiricism'); (2) that a metaphysic can in some sense or in some part be derived from logic; (3) that categories may appropriately be called true or false. The discussion of Tychism and Synechism, like Peirce's own statements, neglects to make out (in answer to Leibniz and Hume) the sense in which any relation save that of self-identity can be understood as a necessary connection. Students of Peirce will hope for an elucidation of the meaning of 'explained' in such passages as "the unity and regularity of the universe is explained by synechism, . . . The diversity and irregularity of the universe is explained by tychism" (46). WILLIAM R. DENNES UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA On the Contingency of Natural Law. By CHESTER TOWNSEND RUDDICK, Philadelphia, 1932. Pp. 330-384. Mr. Ruddick attempts to distinguish in detail the types of mechanical and statistical law, in order to determine whether "the characteristics of either type of law . . . make it the only sort eligible for a complete description of nature" (358). He concludes that there is no ground for asserting the exclu- sive propriety of either type of law, and that the issue between them is "not one of fact, dependent upon the state of our knowledge, but of motive</page><page sequence="4">No. 6] DESCRIPTIVE NOTICES 607 dependent upon the state of our soul" (368). He represents mechanical laws as yielding descriptions that "deal with the particular individual" (360), and as allowing certain prediction of the future (364 et passim). But unless Mr. Ruddick can find a way to answer the criticisms of Leibniz and Hume of the notion of necessary connection, and of Spinoza of the notions of order and disorder, the prior question of the meaning of certainty of prediction will embarrass a reader of his treatise. Unless laws of nature are taken to refer to nothing but human emotions, it would seem that the issues (which Mr. Ruddick convincingly shows are not issues of fact) would not be issues of "motive" either, but rather questions of notation, as would seem to be the choice he cites as illustrative between the Copernican and the Ptolemaic rendering of the correlations of planetary and stellar positions. WILLIAM R. DENNES UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA New Light on Fundamental Problems Including Nature and Function of Art. A Critical and Constructive Study of the Problems of Philosophy from the New Point of View of Henri Bergson. By T. V. SESHAGIRI Row. Madras, University of Madras, I932. Pp. XViii, 274. This book, which is a doctoral thesis, attempts to formulate a philosophy of morals, of religion, and of art on the basis of Bergsonian thought. It begins with a criticism of Absolute idealism, mainly that of A. E. Taylor, in the light of Bergson's concepts of freedom and creative evolution. On this foundation it replaces the ethics of self-realization with one of self- creation in which moral action is treated as artistic expression. This is followed by an attempt to clarify and defend Bergson's conception of God. God is creative activity itself, source of spirit and matter, growing from perfection to perfection. Since creative activity manifests itself in human ideals, God is not aloof from man, and the religion implied is one of Love. Part II of the book is devoted to a theory of aesthetics. Agreeing with Croce that art is rooted in intuition, the author thinks that Croce has neglected the development of the intuition in its reaction to the external world as the artist works with his material. He therefore develops Croce's "expressionist theory" into his own "creative evolution theory" in such a way as to make it agree with the spirit of Bergson's concepts of intuition and free creativity. An analysis of a number of classical paintings illustrates his theory. E. T. MITCHELL UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS Schule der Abstraktion und der Dialektik. Neue Wege begrifflichen Denkens. Von LEO JORDAN. Munich, Ernst Reinhart, I932. PP. i6o. This volume undertakes to liberate the terms abstract and concrete from the psycho-genetic chains forged by Locke in epistemology and to introduce a complete treatment of the terms by methodological correction. The book has a beginning (historical), a transitional middle (analysis and simple abstraction) and an end (synthesis or double abstraction: dialectic). "Un- sere Methode ist diejenige der kritischen Linguistik. Diese misst Begriffe und W6rte an ihren Quellen, niimlich den Dingen und ihren Beziehungen." The philological approach, however, including introspective and aesthetic angles, is emphatically denied.</page><page sequence="5">6o8 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIV. Schule der Abstraktion is obscure and garrulous. It has the true Munich Bierfest atmosphere; still, it is stimulating and contains some suggestive steps in epistemology. Rather than linguistic the book is epistemological in bias, if epistemology is considered as the product of psychology and logic after the Cartesian model. The author does not convincingly overcome the psycho-genetic and introspective position which he disavows in his intro- duction. GEORGE G. LECKIE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA Mecanismes et conscience. Par E. AUGIER. Paris, Felix Alcan, I934. PP. 356. M. Augier holds that psychology can be thoroughly objective and at the same time make use of introspection, provided the tendency of the classical psychologists to mingle observer and observed is overcome. To this end he has rewritten the familiar materials of mental life in terms, not of remem- bered and generalized content or states, but of specific mechanisms func- tioning in a temporal order. This attempted rehabilitation of internal analysis and its reconciliation with behaviorism is, as its author realizes, a direct challenge to the whole Bergsonian position. In spite of M. Augier's extensive efforts, it is easier to feel that we have two languages for the "same facts" than it is to demonstrate their mutual equivalence or the philosophical monism which he discerns beneath their differences. HAROLD A. LARRABBEE UNION COLLEGE L'Individualite. Par MAURICE CAULLERY, PIERRE JANET, C. BOUGLE, J. PIAGET, LUCIEN FEBVRE. Paris, Felix Alcan, I933. PP. I57. The difficulties encountered in extending so anthropomorphic a concept as that of individuality to the rest of creation are illustrated by this report of the lectures and discussions during the third "international week of synthesis" convened by M. Henri Berr. Both in biology and in psychology, individuality is found only en devenir, as a tendency toward unity rather than as a finished and definable product. The professors of sociology, child psychology, and history find the going a bit easier, perhaps because less precision is expected of them. There is a condensed summary of the week's conclusions by M. Georges Matisse. HAROLD A. LARRABEE UNION COLLEGE Neo-scolastica idealismo e spiritualismo. Per FRANCESCO OLGIATI e ARMANDO CARLINI. Milano, Societa Editrice "Vita e Pensiero", 1933. PP. viii, i8o. This is a debate between a Neo-scolastic and a Catholic idealist, although Mr. Carlini quite correctly qualifies the epithet 'idealist' as attributed to his doctrines. His is the attempt to reach the interiority of thought, an interiority which Greek philosophy and even modern idealism have betrayed. The best of Thomas Aquinas, he thinks, is in the direction of this interiority of thought and of reality, and the Greek influence under which he labored merely covered up and distorted the real logic of his theological premises. This is somewhat akin to the theory of Gouhier and others that the tragedy of St. Thomas was that the accepted science of his time was Aristotle's.</page><page sequence="6">No. 6] DESCRIPTIVE NOTICES 609 Father Olgiati, on the other hand, quite rightly doubts whether a science of metaphysics, or any science, can be built on Mr. Carlini's daring attempt to reach the absolute spiritual interiority of reality. A debate of this sort would be very worth while on this side of the water, where Neo-scholasticism turns on itself in such sterile fashion without the opposition of anyone accepting the same theological premises. R. CATESBY TALIAFERRO UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA La religiosita dell'arte e della filosofia. Per ARMANDO CARLINI. Firenze, G. C. Sansoni, I934. Pp. X, 232. This work gives more systematic form to some of the general ideas enunciated by Mr. Carlini in the debate with Father Olgiati. It is quite clear that his is a dialectic of problems and inadequacies, and that he is expressing a traditional Augustinian principle in idealistic terminology. The conflict within man of sameness and otherness, of interiority and exteriority, in pure reason, practical reason and in pure sensibility, demands a transcen- dental principle of absolute interiority, the 'pure psychological principle'. But that this principle is never experienced, although its existence must be posited, presents another problem of inadequacy of man to himself, and this, in turn, postulates the existence of the Transcendent, the 'theological principle'. It is through the necessary posing of these problems, of these flights to the infinite, that religiousness is introduced into philosophy and esthetics. R. CATESBY TALIAFERRO UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA L'Odyssee de la conscience dans la derniere philosophic de Schelling. Par VLADIMIR JANKE'LEVITCH. Paris, Felix Alcan, 1933. PP. 358. Although Schelling's philosophy appears to have changed from one of 'system' to one of 'process' or 'growth', the author of this study contends that it is consistently the latter; the change is one of accent only. Reacting against the Kantian and Fichtean idealism, and against monism and the emanation theory, Schelling is said to have made fully clear, in his later writings, a complete organicistic philosophy. By this he thought to reconcile countless philosophical antitheses, such as realism and idealism, the one and the many, freedom and necessity, spirit and matter, subject and object, action and theory. One must study the relationship of the generator to the en- gendered to get the secret of the solution of these problems. Jankelevitch gives a full account of Schelling's metaphysics. Bergson and Leibniz are, apparently, Schelling's closest philosophical companions. PAUL REYNOLDS WESLEYAN UNIVERSITY, MIDDLETOWN, CONNECTICUT</page></plain_text>
