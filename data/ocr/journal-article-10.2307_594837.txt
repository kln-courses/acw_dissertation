<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reviews of Books 319 The Origin and Development of Religion in Vedic Literature. By P. S. DESHIMUKH. . . With a foreword by A. BERRIEDALE KEITH. London: OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS, 1933. xvi + 378 PP. This Oxford doctoral dissertation was completed about ten years ago; no publication since 1924 seems to have been used in it. It is thus out of date bibliographically at least; but also in other ways. It should not have been published without far-reaching revision. As a descriptive account of the religion of the Veda it is negligi- ble, and doubtless is not meant to claim much originality. Only a minor part is devoted to this subject: that part contains chiefly a brief and conventional treatment of Rigvedic mythology (closely following Macdonell for the most part), plus a yet briefer and more perfunctory chapter on the Brdhmanas; nothing on the Upanisads, and next to nothing on the Atharva Veda. It is, indeed, clear from the title that the author's interest lies elsewhere; namely, in de- veloping his theories of the origin of Indic and Indo-European religion (and even of religion generally), and its relation to magic. In itself, the Vedic religion serves as a sort of peg on which to hang an extensive structure of speculation, which occupies the greater part of the book. Mr. D. draws a sharp line between " magic," which is "coercive," and "religion," which is devotional and "propitiatory" (p. 20). These two are regarded as mutually exclusive and irreconcilable opposites, "fundamentally different attitudes of mind" (p. 131), altho sometimes it is admitted that both may have existed side by side "from very early times" (p. 135). Among the Indo- Europeans, " magic," if it existed at all (which sometimes the author inclines to doubt, p. 63), was very unimportant compared with devotional "religion." Their migratory life " would prevent them from being very superstitious or magical," since "magic, generally speaking, is the curse of a settled . . . life" (p. 63),- an astonishing dictum for which no evidence is offered (it is news to me that nomads are " generally " not addicted to magic). Like the Indo-Europeans, their descendants the Indo-Iranians and the Vedic Indians were devotees of true "religion," and had little or no " magic." Even the Atharva Veda contains " not truly magical charms " but " degenerate forms of prayer " (p. 135) ; and further- more, the Atharvan compositions are very late and belong only to a</page><page sequence="2">320 Reviews of Books decadent stage of Vedic religion. " The Rigveda is the only book where we can find the pure Vedic religion " (p. 198). From this it may be guessed that Mr. D. is vigorously opposed to the theory that religion develops out of magic. Much that he says against this theory has a great deal of force. But he is so ardent in the cause that he comes perilously close to arguing that magic develops out of religion. Indeed he actually does argue that about Atharvan magic, as we saw. Here he certainly goes much too far. In fact, I think he greatly exaggerates the cleavage between what he calls "magic" and "religion." Let us accept his dis- tinction between these terms (it has its convenience, tho I can see also some inconveniences); let us call " coercive " super- naturalistic practices and compositions "magical," and devotional ones "religious." That it is possible to make such a distinction, in the abstract, may be admitted. Yet both seem to me better described as different aspects of the same thing; and (what is really important) at any rate no psychological (or, if you like, linguistic) distinction is made between them in the Veda. As a matter of fact, primitive-and even not so primitive-man naturally tries to impose his will on his environment by force so far as he thinks he can, and resorts to propitiation of some sort or other only when he feels con- fronted by force majeure, or when he thinks that cajolery is apt to be easier or more effective than a domineering attitude. He deals thus with his fellow humans, and quite similarly with the non- human powers with which he comes in contact, and to which his animistic fancy assigns volitional and other anthropomorphic func- tions like his own. (See my essay on " The Religion of the Veda " in Religions of the Past and Present, ed. J. A. Montgomery, Phila- delphia, 1918, especially p. 117 f.) " Gods " are merely " spirits " or mysterious powers too mighty to be dominated by force; that is their only distinction from the powers used in " magic." There are many border-line cases which slip over from one class to the other according to shifts of human psychology; nay, even the highest " gods " may, in extreme cases, be conceived as " coercible ": witness the BrAhmanas, where (we may grant Mr. Deshmukh) " religion" has changed (" degenerated" if you like) into "magic." Gen- erally, on the other hand, a man does not pray to his ox or his plow, simply because he thinks he doesn't have to, in order to control them. If he thinks he could profit by cajoling them instead of bullying them, he does so; then " magic " changes into " religion."</page><page sequence="3">Reviews of Books 321 Taken as a whole, neither is " older " than the other and neither " originates from " the other. But also, the two are inextricably blended-rather, in the Veda at least, never at all distinguished psychologically (aliter, linguistically). They are very frequently combined in the same verses, both Vedic and other. This is disputed by Mr. D. on p. 155, where we read that except the word mantra, "which in the Indian vernaculars has come to mean 'incantation,' but which originally meant ' a hymn,' there cannot be found in the Sanskrit language any words for 'magic,' ' magical,' or ' magician,' and ' priest,' ' priestly,' or 'priesthood' which have anything common between them." I think it can very easily be shown that this is the reverse of the truth. In the Veda it would be much more nearly true, and indeed would involve very little exaggeration, to say that every such word has both mean- ings; the fact being, as I said, that to the Vedic consciousness the two are absolutely one. Any Sanskrit dictionary will show that mantra means " magic charm " as well as " devotional hymn " already in the Rigveda itself (I am sure Mr. D. cannot mean that this alleged " change " does not occur until " the Indian vernacu- lars," tho his statement is most unfortunate, in suggesting that absurdity). Exactly the same is true of brahman, which is probably the favorite word of the Atharvan magicians for their own charms (so used about a hundred times). They constantly call themselves brahman, vipra, vipascit, karu, etc. (references in Whitney's Word Index). In short, they apply all the time to themselves and their activities the entire vocabulary used by the Rigvedic priest-poets of themselves and their activities, except only technical words referring to the specific ritual role of the Rigvedic (hotar) priest. Mr. D. makes much of the fact that ydtudhana and yJtuvid (" sorcerer, black-magician ") are not used of priests. A curiously naive argu- ment! These are terms of abuse. They are applied never to the speaker but only to those who use magic against " us." The yatudhana is simply a vipra whom the speaker hates; naturally he is not complimented by identification with the speaker's own class. We, the vipras, do the same things that the yatudhdna does (the AV. is full of such charms-as well as of their antidotes), but of course only for our own righteous ends; the enemy is by definition wicked. On p. 60 it is argued that if magic had flourished in Rigvedic times as it did (he here admits) in Atharvan times, the RV. could</page><page sequence="4">322 Reviews of Books not have been " kept free from any traces of " it " by the care and cunning of the collectors of the hymns," so as " to leave no trace of its existence whatsoever, even in that most heterogeneous of col- lections called the Rigveda." It would be hard to crowd into a short passage a greater number of errors. The Rigveda as we have it contains plenty of " magic." There are genuine Atharvanic charms, not only in Books 1 and 10 (e. g. the vermin-charm 1. 191), but even in the family-books (e. g. the sleep-charm 7. 55, part of which occurs in the AV. where it is more at home). And it is only in its present expanded form (containing magic) that the RV. can prop- erly be called a " heterogeneous collection." If we should limit our consideration to the original kernel, which we can roughly deter- mine as the hieratic family collections (partly included in Book 1) and Book 9 (minus certain late accretions to them, of course not clearly definable at times), then and only then could we say that it contained no " magic " in Mr. D.'s sense. But it also contained e. g. no marriage or funeral rites (would Mr. D. then maintain that these, also, were cultivated little or not at all in the "pure " Rigvedic times?). The truth is that this original RV. (the only RV. which contained " no trace " of " magic "), so far from being " heterogeneous," was remarkably homogeneous, and had a strictly limited practical purpose. It was a hymn-book of selections to be used by the hotar-priest at the hieratic, aristocratic, three-fire rites, of which the most important was the soma-cult. Naturally, there- fore, it contained only hymns addressed to the powerful gods of those rites. But the practisers of this cult also engaged in very many other " religious " and " magical " rites. It was not " care and cunning" that excluded them from the (original) RV., but the practical purposes of the thoroly ritualistic and highly sophisticated priestly authors. And in spite of this they were not, finally, excluded from the collection as it has come down to us. The old idea that the Rigvedic religion was a simple nature- worship, and that the poets were children of nature pouring forth the naive devotion of their hearts to the divine powers of the uni- verse, was exploded so long ago that I supposed no one now held it. But Mr. D. seems to come quite close to it, at least for the early Rigveda. See e. g. p. 138, where we read of the " crude but child- ishly simple . . . prayers addressed to the various gods "-in IE. and Indo-Iranian times, it is true, but just below, this state of things " can be proved to have prevailed . . . till the time of the</page><page sequence="5">Reviews of Books 323 Rigveda." And indeed, what other evidence could there be for such a characterization of IE. and Indo-Iranian prayers? Later, to be sure, a growth of ritualism in the RV. is admitted, and even " the whole body of hymns " may have been regarded as ritualistic in " the latter half of the Rigvedic period " (p. 339). To me it seems that one who sees anything " childishly simple " in any composition of the Rigveda is manifesting considerable simplicity himself. I cannot take space to list the numerous errors of detail which mar the book. Many of them cannot be misprints; as when Boghaz- k6i is located in Persia (twice, pp. 195, 197), or when Boehtlingk and Roth's lexicon is attributed to an author named " Petersberg" (so! p. xv).
