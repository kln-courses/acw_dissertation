<plain_text><page sequence="1">This essay examines British women's travel writing on Greece as the configuration of gender, imperialism , and Hellenism. Despite disproving accounts of male travellers , women writers complied with imperialist operations constituting modern Greece as the orient. To encounter and claim the past , they represented the present as alien and degenerate. "Roving Englishwomen": Greece in Women's Travel Writing EFTERPI MITSI I am so angry with myself that I will pass by all the other islands with this general reflection , that 'tis impossible to imagine any- thing more agreeable than this journey would have been between two or three thousand years since , when, after drinking a dish of tea with Sapho, I might have gone , the same evening , to visit the temple of Homer in Chios , and passed this voyage in taking plans of magnificent temples , delineating the miracles of statuaries, and conversing with the most polite and most gay of mankind. Alas! Art is extinct here, the wonders of nature alone remain. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, The Turkish Embassy Letters The seen first from woman the sea, traveller the shore to Greece of Greece never fills set Lady foot there; Mary seen from the sea, the shore of Greece fills Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's letter of 31 July 1718 with desire, nostalgia, and loss. Montagu sailed through Ottoman - held Greece on her way to England from Constantinople, where her husband had briefly served as an ambassador. However, she did not visit the mainland, despite her desire to read ancient Greek literature in its "authentic" loca- tions, anticipating the archaeological attitude in the study of ancient literature. After her insightful observations of Turkey and its women, whether subverting or epitomiz- ing orientalist discourse, Montagu was afraid to disturb Mosaic 35/2 0027- 1 276-00/ 1 290 1 6$02.00©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">130 Mosaic 35/2 (June 2002) the ideal, the imaginary landscape of classical antiquity by experiencing contemporary reality. Montagu regretted not landing "on the famed Peloponessus" (147), complaining, "Instead of demi-gods and heroes I was credibly informed 'tis now overrun by robbers, and that I should run a great risk of falling into their hands by undertaking such a journey through a desert country" (148). Her ambivalence about the (deferred) Greek journey reflects the ambiguous position of Greece itself; situated at the threshold between East and West, Greece not only questions the travellers' binary opposition between Europe and the Orient, but it is also divided against itself, between its idealized timeless image and its current decline. Montagu's journey into the past by effacing the present represents the paradox of women's travel writing on Greece: in order to encounter and claim the past (the reputed origin of Western civilization), the present is seen as alien, primitive, and degenerate. In the eighteenth century, Greece was still considered a dangerous and remote place to visit, especially for women, who "did not fit the traveler's image as heroic explorer, scientist, or authoritative cultural interpreter" (Böhls 17). Besides Montagu, only Lady Craven visited Greece in 1786, accompanied by Count Choiseul Gouffier, the French ambassador to the Porte and a collector of Greek antiquities. Elizabeth Craven, a playwright and woman of letters, began her voyage (which included Crimea, Istan- bul, and Greece) after her legal separation from her husband, the sixth Earl of Craven; the letters forming her travel book (published in 1789) were addressed to a fictitious male friend (Melman 48-49). Craven was indeed an unusual traveller since most eighteenth-century British visitors to Greece were antiquarians and scholars, busy sketching monuments and acquiring antiquities, roles that excluded women. Similarly, in the beginning of the nineteenth century, the "Levant Lunatics," the romantic and adventurous young men longing for ruins and exotic experiences, could not be encumbered by female companions. It is the Victorian and Edwardian women who first travelled alone to Greece (although some accompanied their husbands abroad), writing accounts of their travels, works published and read at the time of publica- tion but never reprinted. Despite claims that "women travelers have not written as frequently about Greece as they have about more exotic [. . .] locales" (Eisner 2) and that there is a "lack of good work by [. . .] women in the literature of Greek travel" (228), I suggest that there is a diverse and remarkable body of travel writing on Greece by women from the mid-nineteenth to the early twentieth century, the period of "high impe- rialism," which coincides with the national formation of modern Greece.</page><page sequence="3">EfterpiMitsi 131 Contrary to stereotypes about Victorian middle-class women confined at home, women travellers to Greece, who were mostly middle-class, did not simply escape from the restrictions of the domestic life, imposed by their class and gender, but also formed a political discourse, negotiating different genres (travel writing, autobiography, adventure) and identities: the resourceful and strong female narrator juxtaposed with traditional gender roles, the imperial voice countering feminism and philhellenism. Recent publications approaching the larger question of women's travel writing have overlooked Greece, even when focussing on constructions of the orient. Billie Melman, for instance, whose definition of the ori- ent includes the territories under Ottoman rule in Europe (3), does not consider accounts of visits to Greece in Women's Orients: English Women and the Middle East , 1718-1918, although in many cases it was the same women (Beaufort, Craven, Dawson-Damer, Egerton, Grosve- nor, Stanhope, Lewis) writing on Greece, Turkey, and the Middle East, usually in the same book. Even established studies of travel literature on Greece, such as Robert Eisner's Travelers to an Antique Land: The His- tory and Literature of Travel to Greece , assume that there is no writing by women before the post- World War I period, other than the token case of Lady Montagu. Additionally, John Pemble, in The Mediterranean Passion: Victorians and Edwardians in the South, and James Buzard, in The Beaten Track: European Tourism, Literature, and the Ways to Culture, 1800-1918, are only peripherally concerned with Greece. Only Artemis Leontis's seminal Topographies of Hellenism: Mapping the Homeland briefly discusses Virginia Woolf's relation to Greece, without, however, addressing the issue of women travellers. TJntil recently a neglected area of research, women's travel literature reconstructs an alternative women's history, challenging stereotypes and showing that women travellers were not oddities and freaks but usually average women who, armed with John Murray's and Karl Baedeker's guidebooks and gladstone bags, desired to find and even claim their own Greece, often disproving the accounts of male travellers. Seeing themselves as travellers rather than tourists, British women incorporated the paradox described by Buzard in The Beaten Track : although it was the birth of modern tourism, through the combined efforts of Thomas Cook, Murray, and Baedeker, which made the journey to Greece possible for women travellers, they still considered it distinctly different from the popular organized tours to the Continent. In the era of tourism, "a broadly accessible form of leisure travel no longer based on the overt class</page><page sequence="4">132 Mosaic 35/2 (June 2002) and gender prerogatives of the Grand Tour" (Buzard 18), women decided to experience their tour of Greece as a privilege. Like Lady Montagu, they desired to trace "the exact geography of Homer, whom [they] had in hand" (146). The first sight of Greece from the ship elicited for travellers like Catherine Janeway "deep reflections on the past. [. . .] We admire the sublimity of the Swiss scenery, but it has fewer associations for us with the past; the poet's fancies have not made us venerate it as we do the classic scenes in Greece; it is not alive for us in the same degree" (6). It was the travel to the past and its inevitable conflict with the present that connected a mixed group of Englishwomen in Greece. Visitors varied in relation to class, politics, education, and even to the interpretation of Greece, ranging from the Victorian and Edwardian upper-class tour- ists travelling with their husbands (Brassey, Dawson-Damer, Grosvenor, Londonderry, Vivanti), to the wives and daughters of British diplomats and expatriates (Beaufort, Blunt, Skene), to scholars (Garnett, Harrison, Lewis), writers (Woolf), painters (Walker), Christian women (Egerton, Janeway), and suffragists with neo-pagan inclinations (Armstrong, Moore), travelling alone or with female companions. Still, the writing of their vision of Greece identifies them as a distinct unit in the literature about the region, as well as in nineteenth-century women's writing. It would, however, be too simplistic to read British women's travelogues as feminist texts. According to Joan Scott, the "realization of the radical potential of women's history" - in this case the (re) discovery of women's writing about Greece - does not involve "the recounting of great deeds performed by women" but comes in the writing of texts that "focus on women's experience and analyze the ways in which politics construct gender and gender constructs politics" (27, emph. Scott's). Any discussion of women travel writers should avoid being essentialist about gender but be aware "of the dark side of travel itself" (Grewal 10) as a Eurocentric form of "planetary consciousness" (Pratt 9) and "bourgeois authority" (10). Therefore, the discussion of women's travel writing on Greece cannot focus only on its differences from that of male writers, ignoring the writers' complicity with imperialist operations that constitute modern Greece as the orient while appropriating its classical past. In the context of the Balkans, a region functioning as a colonial paradigm in the middle of Europe, the case of Greece reveals a nation ideologically constructed by Europe without having been, strictly speaking, colonized. In Dream Nation: Enlightenment, Colonization, and the Institution of Modern Greece, Stathis Gourgouris, investigating the national formation of Greece, connects the story of Greece with that</page><page sequence="5">EfterpiMitsi 133 of India: "Both are burdened with a classical past, a similar trap for the nationalist phantasm: modern malaise to be overcome and ancient glory to be regained" (6). Likewise, for Gregory Jusdanis, Greece, "as the first nation to declare itself independent from the Ottoman Empire and as one of the earliest nation-states in Europe, [. . .] is eminently postcolonial" (172). However, being part not of the British Empire but of a non- Western power, the Ottoman Empire, Greece complicates the "typical" postcolonial model. The nineteenth-century British travellers blended colonial attitude with Romantic vision, both confused and enchanted by the hybridity of contemporary Greece (classical, "oriental," Balkan, and European). Women's travel accounts, despite their awareness of a new role for women, inevitably share features with male -authored texts about Greece: both men and women writers construct Greece according not only to their gender but also to their nationality and class, reproducing the meaning that Hellas held for the West, especially for Britain and its elite, since the eighteenth century. "It was the native soil of one," Isabel Armstrong confesses upon arrival, "the long-looked-for goal of [the traveller's] desires" (14). Greece, according to Michael Herzfeld, "maybe unique in the degree to which the country as a whole has been forced to play the contrasted roles of Ur-Europa and humiliated oriental vassal at one and the same time" (19). Although, as Sara Mills argues, "women travel writers were unable to adopt the imperialist voice with the ease male writers did" (3), their accounts were produced and received in the same context, both introducing Greece to a wide audience just as travel itself became accessible to the middle class. On the one hand, British women are more interested in modern Greece and its people than male travellers are, focussing on the details of everyday life, representing images of domesticity, and meeting and often interpreting Greek women beyond the stereotypes of oriental submission and passivity. On the other hand, they share the patronizing attitude of male travellers, and even their positive images of the Greek cannot shatter the power of oriental- ism involved in the "translation of the cultural other" (Yegenoglu 84). According to Meyda Yegenoglu, "Orientalism is not simply a question of the dissemination of negative images": its power "does not stem from the distortion of the reality of the Orient" but from the construction "of the very subject it speaks about," and from the production of "a regime of truth about the other" (87-90). Women travellers also share with men travellers the recurrent theme in all travelogues on Greece, the inevitable contrast between past glory</page><page sequence="6">134 Mosaic 35/2 (June 2002) and present decline, idealized antiquity and contemporary reality: "The modern Greece is so flimsy and fragile, that it goes to pieces entirely when it is confronted with the roughest fragment of the old," pronounces the young Virginia Woolf in 1906 (Travels 220-01). Philhellenism is an orientalism; Gourgouris notes that, "in dissociating itself from the Ori- ent, Philhellenism reveals its discomfort with modern Greece, at least with modern Greece as a cultural reality" (139). The philhellenic strategy is to demand that the Greeks play the passive role of the living ancestors of European civilization and then to criticize them for their inability to measure up to it (Herzfeld 105). Guided by the love for ruins and by the desire articulated by Chateaubriand "to look at the Greeks who were dead," the travellers replace the fallen modern nation with the images of otherness in which they need to mirror themselves. Yet, unlike the average English man, most women visitors to Greece finally discover, as Woolf suggests during her travels, that Athens means many more things than the Acropolis and become interested in the ambiguity and "impurity" of the present, while tracing its relation to the past. Women's travel writings on Greece show the criteria that the Brit- ish used to judge another culture, however in this case a culture whose relics were viewed as part of their own intellectual heritage. By visiting and by writing about Greece, nineteenth-century women claimed that heritage, asserting the right to a classical education (from which they had been excluded): the classical Bildung was not only the appropria- tion of Greek culture but also, according to Gourgouris, "an explicit and programmatic colonization of the ideal " (124, emph. Gourgouris's). Since Montagu's attempt to ascertain "the exact geography of Homer," women's narratives are interspersed with quotes from ancient Greek texts, showing pride in their command of Greek literature and language, as well as their possession of the past, the origin of the discourse of the West. Notably, the Scottish scholar Agnes Smith Lewis, who later discov- ered and deciphered the Sinai Palimpsest, learned modern Greek as well, viewing the Greek language as a bridge between past and present. Both she and her companions "had learned ancient Greek with the modern pronunciation according to the ideas of Mr. Schliemann and Profes- sor Blackie" (32). More importantly, the emphasis on their knowledge of antiquity shows women's determination to declare their intellectual independence. Despite the resistance of professional and academic soci- eties, some scholars, such as Jane Ellen Harrison, could make a strong case for membership after her researches in Greece and the publication of several volumes on ancient Greek religion and culture. For Harrison,</page><page sequence="7">EfterpiMitsi 135 a pioneer of the Ritualist school in anthropology and religion, Greece meant not only a career but also a new awareness of women's intellectual and social position. The archaeological excavations in Greece supported Harrison's theory of a "primitive" matriarchal culture existing before the patriarchy represented through the relations of the anthropomorphic Greek gods. By examining the ancient women's festivals and the local cults, she finds traces of a "civilization quite other than patriarchal" and forms the theory of "the making of the goddess," concluding that the various women goddesses (Gaia, Demeter and Kore, Pandora) reflect the cycle of women's lives (including the maiden, bride, mother, grand- mother) (260-61). -Although women's travel accounts of Greece address the general reader, unlike Harrison's more scholarly studies, they are still learned, not only citing ancient authors, a tradition in travel literature on Greece since the early seventeenth century, but also reworking earlier descriptions of the place. Edward Said's definition of the citationary nature of orientalism, of the orient as "less a place than a topos, a set of references, a congeries of characteristics, that seem to have its origin in a quotation, or a frag- ment of a text, or a citation from someone's work" (177), could also apply to Greece: the scholars' and travellers' Greece is a literary and political construct, an ideal ultimately embodied by England. Although there isn't such as thing as a "wholly 'original' travel or travel writing," in women's travel literature the "sense of belatedness and the question of literary appropriation" become even more crucial (Lawrence 25). As "belated wayfarers," visitors to Greece shared Woolf's feeling that "the pageant has passed long ago, and you are come too late, and it matters very little what you think or feel" (Travels 220). Since the study of antiquity as well as the tradition of travel were male dominated, developed by male authors to trace the voyages (both in space and in time) of men, the anxiety of belatedness, shown through the citations, has a twofold sig- nificance. The question is not simply whether women can embrace and modify traditionally male -dominated modes of writing but also whether they can possess the knowledge of antiquity, owning Greece as did their male predecessors. For example, both Lady Craven and Elizabeth Grosvenor view the ruins of Delos through the description of the erudite French eighteenth- century traveller Joseph Pitten de Tournefort. The text has often more authority than the experience of the site, a repression of the Romantic tradition of the "genius loci": Grosvenor avoids writing about the</page><page sequence="8">136 Mosaic 35/2 (June 2002) Acropolis, referring the reader to William Leake and Christopher Wordsworth, whose works "leave nothing to describe" (2:142). Rather than identify with a Romantic narrative persona (following the footsteps of Byron or Chateaubriand), most women travel writers emphasize their scholarly preparation for their voyage, aspiring beyond the status of the tourist, or even avoid competing against their male predecessors in the description of the site. Although Emily Beaufort's journey to southern Albania (Epiros) literally follows Byron's footsteps, tracing his trajectory to Zitza, in her preface, the already published travel writer undermines her own writing by referring "those who seek for something better and more solid [. . .] to the three chapters added by my husband." In Zitza, Beaufort of course quotes from Childe Harold's Pilgrimage on the spot, only to add that "Byron's stanzas [. . .] are rather too good for the occasion. [. . .] The monastery is now comfortable, but uninteresting and unremarkable, except as consecrated by Lord Byron" (18). In women's travel accounts, it is often difficult to distinguish modesty from irony, defense from defiance. Armstrong refuses to provide an impression of the monuments of Athens, as "it can be found in Murray and Baedeker" (100), preferring instead to explore areas not included in the usual tour of Greece in the late nineteenth century, such as Thessaly, a decision that could be interpreted as emancipating. Interestingly, Murray's A Hand- Bookfor Travellers in Greece (seven editions were published from 1845 to 1900) included excerpts from contemporary travel accounts, a fact that questions the traditional opposition between guidebook and travel writ- ing, tourist and traveller. In the monastery of Osios Lukas, Mabel Moore, after lecturing the monks against fasting, refers to Jacob Spon and George Wheler's 1676 visit and then quotes Chandler's Travels in Greece. Even Lewis, usually critical of male travel books, guidebooks, and their prejudices, considers Wordsworth's books "indispensable when visiting the Acropolis" (19). No "original," "innocent" view of Greece is possible; women travellers are scripted in the tradition of the search for antiquity, linked to Britain's political advance to the East. Nineteenth- century women do not yet question Britain's role as the successor of ancient Athens, a role evidenced by the acquisition of antiquities as well as by the appropriation of the understanding of the classical past. Nevertheless, the cultural exploration of Greece through the process of endless copying is juxtaposed in women's travel accounts with the inter- est in the life and customs of modern Greeks. British women attempt to bridge past and present through the language of aesthetics, mainly through detailed descriptions of people's physique, manners, and dances:</page><page sequence="9">EfterpiMitsi 137 "The style of dancing [. . .] is one of the customs which distinguish the Hellenic race from others, [. . .] a custom unchanged for nigh two thou- sand years" (Lewis 298-99). Cast as objects rather than subjects, men, rather than women, are praised for their beauty. Grosvenor finds them "well-looking" and "picturesque," dressed in "the handsomest of national costumes" (2:160); Armstrong, fifty years later, agrees that "to tall dark men the national dress is particularly becoming" (4), concluding that the Greek man's "face may be characteristic of distrust, but his figure is the embodiment of true art. If such were the models the old Greeks had ever before their eyes, it is no wonder that Greece produced such a succession of sculptors and painters" (6). The admiration of Greek men is usually related to primitivism, to the Victorian desire to come closer to the past by studying the present. The nostalgia for an "authentic" Greece emerges as travellers lament over picturesque costumes "rapidly yielding to the mean and ungraceful outlines of Western civilization" (Walker 181). Another difference from male travellers is the portrayal of peas- ant women working hard in the fields, which undermines the typical eroticized representations of Greek women. Since the sixteenth century, European travellers have represented Greek women as beautiful, self- indulgent, "exceedingly amorous" (Spencer 40-42) and, though unveiled, as mysterious and as dangerously erotic as Turkish women. In contrast, women travellers who can approach and talk to Greek women find them ugly and oppressed. In Naxos, Craven proclaims that the "maidens dressed in [their] holiday clothes [are] neither decent nor pretty" (245); while, in Athens, she dismisses an ancient dance performed for her sake by Athenian girls ("a more stupid performance as a dance I never saw") and sneers at women in the baths ("I never saw so many fat women at once together, nor fat ones as fat as these" [263]). Craven is here criticiz- ing the idealization of women's bodies that Lady Montagu included in the famous 1717 letter describing her visit to the Turkish baths at Adri- anople. Whereas Montagu uses allusions to European literature and art to describe the naked women (Böhls 23-45), Craven emphasizes their physicality, representing the other's body as disgusting and grotesque. Mary Dawson-Damer observes that "even the old-looking women are not more than thirty" (1:25), and Armstrong describes them as "walk- ing bundles of dull-coloured rags" (4), assuming that all the beautiful women must have been taken to Turkish harems! Of course, no woman who worked in the fields could have the whiteness and softness of the bourgeois and disciplined Englishwoman. The pity toward Greek women, who fail to live up to expectations of classical beauty, reveals the paradox</page><page sequence="10">138 Mosaic 35/2 (June 2002) of the travellers' blindness toward the grim lot of working-class women at home. Lewis and her travelling companions are constantly shocked by the hard work and unfair life of peasant women, attributing this custom to the pre -Independence era, when Greek men had to hide from the Turks. In a mountain village, "the prettiest girl" (called Asemi) speaks to Lewis of "her field-work," saying, "It was very strange that in other lands husbands worked for their wives, whilst we [. . .] work for the men" (281). The discursive encounter between British and Greek women, who are perceived as other, primitive, and oriental, is crucial to the construction of the travellers as feminist subjects, more free and educated in Greece than at home. Through this encounter, they emerge emancipated and independent, sorry for, yet critical of, their backward "sisters": Lewis concludes that "the ladies [in Greece] need more liberty" and "more emancipation from Thrkish customs" (338). In 1909, Moore criticizes the Athenian upper- and middle-class women of being completely "depen- dent and submissive beings," interested only in "gambling, gossip and dress" (48) in order to emphasize their difference from British suffrag- ists, ignoring the fact that a movement for the emancipation of women had been active in Athens since the late nineteenth century. As travellers finally urge the Greek to "imitate their English sisters by taking to some outdoor sport" (Lewis 340; see Moore 209), their ambiguous relation to Greece becomes once more evident. However, the travellers' "privilege of being the looker rather than looked upon" (Böhls 40) is constantly challenged as the objects of their study, lacking the English sense of privacy and discretion, return the gaze: Felicia Skene, during a visit to a remote area, describes "the whole population of villagers assembled [at the door] to gaze at us" (44); Lewis suggests to her guide that, "if we were to be looked on in the light of an exhibition, he should at least charge two francs a head for showing us" (160-61); and Armstrong has to block the door, as an entire village keeps coming to their room to look at them and touch her companion's loose long hair. In Parga, Beaufort realizes that the picturesque coffee shop she has found "was not for us only: we soon found out that this olive grove was the Kensington Gardens of Parga, and in a short time the whole town has turned out to inspect us" (54). Humour not only conveys the rarity of such travellers, but it also disguises their sad realization that women are excluded from the role of the romantic traveller: they may be tourists (led) but not travellers (leading). The fact that many are travelling without a man excites the rural women's curiosity. The most common question, repeatedly addressed to all single travellers, concerns their marital</page><page sequence="11">EfterpiMitsi 139 status: Where are your husbands? Aren't you married? Greek women, who would not address a foreign man, unwittingly keep reminding these "eccentric" visitors of their common domestic predicament. While Armstrong dreads "the fatal inquiry about our relationship" (71), lying that her friend Edith is married, Lewis sees it as a chance to set an example: "We are all unmarried," she answers to an old woman, who "clasped her hands with astonishment and delight. I felt as if I had driven in the point of a wedge by making her think that it is possible for women to do something on their own account" (202). Indeed, women travellers feel that they have done something "on their own account": in most prefaces, writers emphasize that despite warnings by friends and guidebooks alike, they ventured to Greece, a country that unlike Italy and Egypt was off the track in the nineteenth century. Until the 1890s, domestic transport depended on horse power, and rural banditry was endemic (Pemble 23). "We flattered ourselves that we had proved that any woman - who did not mind roughing it [. . .] could attempt this journey with ease" asserts Armstrong at the end of her book (295). Their accounts show a growing confidence in the ability of women to withstand the rigours of travel, relishing the adventures, hardship, dirt, and strange food. Although the braving of dangers is empowering, it also places women's narratives within "the imperial and Romantic structures that defined travel" (Grewal 80). Armstrong, for instance, in her preface defines Greece as "terra incognita" for the majority of the British. Even the title of her book, Two Roving Englishwomen in Greece , suggests risk, audacity, and adventure. On the one hand, women travel writers wish to contradict stereotypes about the country described, focussing on specific rather than general impressions; on the other, the motifs of the escape from home, the freedom gained from travelling, and the "penetration" of the "terra incognita" follow the tradition of the male romantic traveller. Lewis dispels the supposed difficulty and discomfort experienced in Greece by Lord Windsor and Mr. Farrar, the authors of A Tour in Greece , by writing that "[they] must either have had a wretched guide, or must have been deeply imbued with prejudice against the natives" (98). She also mocks Mark Twain, who, after paying "a midnight visit to Athens breaking quarantine," arrived at the conclusion that all Greeks are thieves! Lewis, who spent many months in Greece, exposes his prejudice, pointing out that "exaggerations by former travellers are apt to mislead intending ones" (350-51). It is hardly surprising that women writers employ orientalist discourse to defend Greeks from such prejudice, blaming the Ottoman occupation of Greece for manners and customs</page><page sequence="12">140 Mosaic 35/2 (June 2002) they dislike. Lewis argues that, due to the exaggerated expectations of the British since Byron's day, the Greek people are seen as "rascals" and "lazy," whereas "their chief faults are those born of slavery, their chief virtues, those of their ancestors" (340). The colonial voice is evident in Grosvenor, who finds Greeks "courteous and obliging," "pleased with what is given to them" (2:191), and in Skene (an ardent philhellenist), who suggests that "more is just of their ignorance and superstition than is altogether just," admitting, though, "their simple and childlike faith," "their lively imaginations and quick feelings" (61). Moore, too, calls them "little children," indifferent to "ethical ideas," "born when the world was very young. What is to be done for you but to love you and continually correct you?" (147), she finally wonders. Greece is often represented as "a childlike figure from an era before the achievement of European maturity" (Herzfeld 69), a child needing correction and education by the West. As travellers, women participated in the orientalist "gaze," using paternalistic images of that kind; as women looking at women, being at the same time spectacles themselves, they engaged in ambiguous rela- tions of reciprocity and analogy. The question of whether Greeks should be judged "by an European or an Asiatic standard" (Lewis 341) embodies the ambivalence of women's travel writing on Greece. Travellers wonder where Greece fits in the dichotomy between East and West and whether it can "return" to Europe to claim its past: "The East may remain the East and live, but if the East chooses the advantages of Western life and shirks its pain-giving respon- sibilities, then it must surely die" (Moore 35) . As the British in the evalu- ation of Greece "measured present realities against the achievement of an idealized past" (Augustinos 49), their disappointment was inevitable: "Philhellenism dies a natural death, or at least goes to sleep until such a time as a nobler spirit breathes in the land" (Moore 32). Their dilemma is related to the question of whether the Greek nation deserves its antiquities (including those in the British museum), a question that arises as travel- lers visit the Parthenon and other monuments. The travellers' acquisi- tion of antiquities and the occasional vandalizing of ruins expose the hypocrisy of their solicitude for historic sites. Craven, disappointed because she is not allowed to pick up the broken marbles of Parthenon, recommends that the emperor "should take advantage of the desire of the Porte has to oblige him, in order to collect the fragments of the temple of Minerva" (261-62). The Marchioness of Londonderry delights in her husband's carving their names on one of the columns of Parthenon "to be perhaps read in after-years by our children and children's children"</page><page sequence="13">EfterpiMitsi 141 (185). Later, women travel writers partly justify Lord Elgin for despoil- ing the temple, by arguing that he "removed the frieze in order to save the valuable works of art [. . .] from destruction by the Türks" (Janeway 30). Lewis, the most critical of Elgin, after admitting that "we shall not probably restore to Greece the treasures of our own great museum," urges British millionaires "to supply funds to restore the fragments" and thus "repair any artistic wrong which we may have done the little nation" (23 - 24). Although travellers see the Acropolis as "the lost origin of a common heritage" (Leontis 48), they argue that the proper context of the stolen objects is the exhibition space of the national museum, an emblem of nineteenth- century culture. The notion that Greeks are not worthy of their past is connected also to the belief that they did not achieve their independence from Turkey through their own effort but through the intervention of European powers, especially England's. By the beginning of the twentieth century, the conventional attitude to Greece was that no relation exists between modern and ancient Greeks. Virginia Woolf's journals from the 1906 visit to Greece clearly represent this attitude: "Like a shifting layer these loosely composed tribes of many different people lie across Greece; call- ing themselves Greek indeed, but bearing the same kind of relation to the old Greek that their tongue does to his. [. . .] So you must look upon the modern Greeks as a nation of mongrel element and a rustic beside the classic speech of pure bred races. [. . .] They do not understand Greek of the age of Pericles - when I speak it" ( Travels 210-13). Yet Woolf's early story, "A Dialogue upon Mount Pentelicus," written after her visit, derides the British (including her own attitude as a tourist) who conde- scend to address the "dirty Greek peasant boys [. . .] in their own tongue as Plato would have spoken it had Plato learned Greek at Harrow" (64). Women travellers - who certainly did not learn Greek at Harrow - were painfully aware of the ambiguity of Greece. Woolf's pronouncement that "Germans are tourists and Frenchmen are tourists but Englishmen are Greeks" ("Dialogue" 63) questions Englishwomen's relation to Greece. In the end, their visit was both disappointing and empowering. The imperial project connected all the British, rather than the lowly modern Greeks, to the ancient Athenians: "We are, in some respects, the modern representatives of these Athenians. We have the same passionate love of freedom, and we have inherited a maritime empire. [. . .] The power which can command the waves commands the world" (Lewis 15).
