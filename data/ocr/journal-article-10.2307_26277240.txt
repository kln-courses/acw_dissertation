<plain_text><page sequence="1">CRITICISM OF THOMAS HARDY: A SELECTED CHECKLIST MAURICE BEEBE BONNIE CULOTTA and ERIN MARCUS NOTE: In preparing this checklist, we have placed the main emphasis on Hardiana published since 1940, date of the Hatdy centenary. From Carl Weber's The First Hundred Years of Thomas Hardy, which provides an exhaustive listing of ma terial published prior to and during the centenary, we have retained all books and pamphlets specifically on Hardy and a limited number of essays which seem to us of continuing value and interest. For later material we have relied mainly on an unpublished bibliography of Hardy criticism and scholarship from 1940 to 1957 prepared by Mrs. Culotta as a term project in Professor Hugh Dick's seminar in bibliography at the University of California at Los Angeles. Although we have retained a much larger proportion of the post-1940 material, we have as usual omitted unpublished dissertations, foreign criticism, reviews and journalistic com ment of transitory interest, routine discussions in histories of literature or the novel, and casual references. If we have not kept everything that may interest the advanced specialist, we have tried to include virtually all scholarship and a goodly portion of that criticism which we feel is likely to interest the serious teacher and student of Hardy. The checklist is organized in three main parts. The first consists of general studies—books, monographs, and essays on Hardy as man and writer, bibliographies, and books on the Hardy locale. The second part is restricted to studies primarily on the poetry, including The Dynasts. The third part lists studies of individual works of fiction. After the title of the story or novel and the date of initial publication, the data is presented in four sections: (A) place in the standard Wessex Edition (London, Macmillan, 1912-1914) and, in the case of shorter works, the title of the collection in which the story first appeared in book form; (B) editions containing introductions and/or notes; (C) an index to general studies listed in Part I; and (D) special studies not previously cited. Titles of the major books on Hardy are capitalized. Books and essays by one author are listed chronologically rather than alphabetically, and material which we have been unable to examine or index is so identified. 258</page><page sequence="2">I.
