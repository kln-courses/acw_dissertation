The Yan and the two local groups, one active in the Yan mountainous region and the other in the Jing, Jin, and Tang area, developed a cooperative relationship during the early Western Zhou period. The cooperation between Yan and local elites was mutually beneficial. While local elite culture was heavily influenced by that of the Shang and Zhou, local traditions continued to be present. KEY WORDS China; Western Zhou; Yan; Bronzes; colonialism. Studies of colonialism have long concentrated on a few major historical cases: the colonial expansion in the Mediterranean region by ancient Greece and Rome, and the worldwide European expansion from the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries. These studies often adopt a core-periphery perspective on the relationship be tween colony and host society. This core-periphery model considers the colonizer superior, advanced and powerful, a culture that dominated the host society and stimulated local social and cultural changes. The colonized, often perceived as inferior and backward, remain largely invisible in much research literature. Recent archaeological studies on colonies and colonization in prehistoric, early historical, and non-Westem societies around the world have prompted us to rethink colonialism in all aspects (e.g., Algaze, 1993; Dyson, 1985; Gosden, 2004; Lyons and Papadopoulos, 2002; Stein, 2005a). These studies not only expand colonial studies temporally and spatially to a wider range of societies and broader regions by applying archaeological methodology, but more importantly recognize that colonization is a widespread, cross-cultural, and recurring phenomenon that often has a great impact on all parties involved. They argue that comparative 1 Department of Visual Arts, Gettysburg College, Gettysburg, PA, 17325; e-mail: ysun@gettysburg.edu. 159 1092-7697/06/0600-0159/1 ? 2006 Springer Science-I-Business Media, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">160 Sun studies of colonialism in societies across different times and regions are necessary in order to develop a synthetic, balanced, and comprehensive view of colonialism and colonization. Studies of colonialism in ancient societies have also raised a host of ques tions fundamental to the understanding of colonialism (Stein, 2005b). The very terms "colony," "colonization," and "colonialism," for example, have been scru tinized, challenged, and even rejected. Relatively neutral terms, such as "colonial encounter," have been proposed. Such studies argue that neither colonies nor host communities were necessarily homogenous entities, and that the relationships be tween the parties involved in the process of colonization, the colony, the colonial homeland, and the host community were far more dynamic and complex than the uneven and unidirectional influence often proposed or assumed by many previous studies. One key aspect emphasized by these studies is the need to recognize the importance of the host society in shaping cultural interaction and the direction of social change. The host society should not be viewed as a passive receiver, but rather as an active and significant player in the process of colonial encounter. Any analysis of colonization, therefore, should take the attitude, ability, and action of host society into account. A great diversity and variation of colonialism is brought into light by these studies. Colonial expansion had different purposes and exercised various strate gies. Colonies across time and space were established to serve various purposes. They functioned as trading posts, such as those established by the Greeks in the Mediterranean and by the Uruk in Mesopotamia; as new settlements to relieve population pressure in the homeland, such as the Greek settler colonies; as new urban centers for population resettlement to reduce threats to the state, such as those created by the Inca empire; as military and administrative outposts, such as the Roman provincial colonies; and as refuges, such as early colonies in the new world (e.g., Algaze, 1993; D'Altroy, 2002; Mackay, 2004; Martin, 1996; Stein, 2005a). Colony and host society developed different strategies to deal with each other depending on their strength, priorities, and preference. A colony could conquer and dominate a local population, compromise and build an alliance, or engage in long-term competition with the local community. Interactions between the two parties could be intensive and frequent, or superficial and periodic. The impact on local social and cultural development by the colony varied greatly as well. Some colonies had a long-lasting impact on the local society, leading to cultural acculturation and hybridization and the birth of new identities, while others were short-lived and had little impact on local culture. It is encouraging to see that studies of colonialism in ancient societies are gaining popularity and that the significance of these studies has been recognized. However, at the same time, it is disappointing that few researches are exam ining colonialism in early Chinese societies. Available archaeological materials accumulated for decades, and rich knowledge on social and cultural changes in</page><page sequence="3">Colonizing China's Northern Frontier 161 Bronze Age China, especially the Shang and Zhou periods, make ancient China an excellent place for studying colonialism in the ancient world. This research attempts to present a case study on colonialism in ancient China by examining the establishment of a vassal state, the Yan, by the Zhou court during the mid-eleventh century BCE. Particularly, it will analyze the role local communities played in response to the establishment of the Yan. The lo cal communities have been largely forgotten in previous studies. The goal of this research is to deepen our understanding of the diversity of colonialism, and broaden our search for general/shared patterns of colonialism as a social phenomenon. BACKGROUND: THE ENFEOFFMENT OF THE ZHOU Most of the Central Plain, the middle reaches of the Yellow River valley in north China, was occupied by the powerful Shang state from the sixteenth to mid-eleventh century BCE. The Shang, the second dynastic power in Chinese history, had a highly developed bronze industry and sophisticated political and ritual systems. The splendid bronzes of the Shang and their lavish display in state and funerary rituals were often admired and desired by its neighbors. Inscriptions on oracle bones, the records of royal divination found at Anyang, the last capital of the Shang, indicate frequent interaction, both peaceful and hostile, between the Shang and its neighboring communities (Zheng, 1994). Material remains of those local societies indicate they were somewhat influenced by the Shang culture. Nevertheless, the local communities were largely able to maintain their political sovereignty and to continue their own cultural tradition in their native land. The Zhou, a small regional state heavily influenced by Shang culture for gen erations, defeated the Shang around the mid-eleventh century BCE and became the third dynastic power centered in the Central Plain. In an effort to manage a vast kingdom that had a dramatically expanded territory and a culturally and ethnically diverse population, the Zhou court sent out members of the royal family and in a few cases, meritorious officials from other clans, to establish a series of vassal states through enfeoffment in the early Western Zhou period. Those states were distributed from the border of the steppe in the north to the far south of the bank of the Yangtze River. In areas far from the Zhou capital, those states not only served as local representatives of the Zhou court, but also colonies whose respon sibility was to bring local communities into the new Zhou political and cultural system. Historical texts and inscriptions on bronzes of the Zhou vividly record how the enfeoffed states were established. The Zhou king bestowed land, people, and precious items (such as grand chariots, bronzes, and flags with a dragon design) to the lord, who then led his subjects to march to the new land (Hsu and Linduff,</page><page sequence="4">162 Sun 1988; Yang, 1999). States enfeoffed in frontier regions often had the support of a strong armed force, fought against local populations, and secured a place to build a capital, usually surrounded by a moat and defensive walls. The newcomer and the local populations were spatially separated. The lord and his subjects settled in the new capital were termed guoren (man in the capital) in historical texts. They were the new ruling group. The local populations scattered across the countryside were called yeren (man in the field). They were ruled by the new lord from the Zhou. Through vassal states, the Zhou was able to build an interrelated, multi layered political network and expand its political and cultural influence into a much larger area. Archaeological discoveries and historical texts suggest that the vassal states in the frontier areas, despite their distance, were not isolated from the court. They were an integral part of Zhou political structure and had an obligation to screen and defend the Zhou court. Although each state was fairly independent in terms of managing its internal affairs, it was required to act in accordance with Zhou political principles. The political authority and legitimacy of each state ultimately came from the Zhou court. Succession of the new lord in each state, passed down from father to the eldest son, had to be legitimated by the court. Some senior positions in the vassal states were directly appointed by the court and those positions were usually inherited by the same family for generations. The Zhou court reinforced its authority through a series of official rituals that had embedded social and political meanings. Each state had an obligation to defend the Zhou, promote Zhou culture, uphold Zhou political principles, participate in ritual ceremonies at the court, and pay homage to the Zhou king. The Zhou had a flexible pacification policy toward the non-Zhou popula tions. The court instructed the lord of newly enfeoffed states to make effort to assimilate and accommodate the local people whenever possible, and to gov ern according to the traditions of the conquered. In an often-quoted paragraph in Zuo Zhuan regarding the enfeoffment of the Jin state in southern Shanxi, for example, lord Shuyu was asked to commence his government according to the principles of the Xia, and to implement policies appropriate to the northern groups of Rong and Di; lord Kangshu was urged to adopt the Shang laws and to honor the Shang traditions, but within the framework of the rules of the Zhou (Li, 1998). Under the guide of the policy of cultural tolerance, each state developed approaches suitable to its own circumstances. It maintained military superiority and conducted military campaigns when necessary, but at same time it consistently carried out policies of coexistence with diverse customs and traditions. The Zhou elites also formed coalitions with the conquered Shang clans to form a broad political alliance. For example, historical texts and archaeological discoveries suggest that elites of the Shang clans were allowed to continue their cultural customs and were absorbed into the ruling class in such states as the Qi, Lu, and Yan.</page><page sequence="5">Colonizing China's Northern Frontier 163 Local populations in vassal states, those "to be colonized," had very different cultural and ethnic backgrounds. Their hostility and hospitality toward the new colonizer varied greatly. People in areas closer to the Zhou metropolitan area were more cooperative, but those living in the eastern and northern frontiers were especially hostile. The Shandong peninsula, for example, was occupied by the dongyi (the barbarians of the east), a people who had fought against the Shang for decades. The newly established Qi state faced strong opposition from the dongyi. It took years before the Qi could find a safe, permanent location for its capital. The feudal network of the Zhou defined the roles of the Zhou court, the vassal states, and the local populations within a political framework, but at the same time left open many possibilities for the states and local populations to pursue. The balance of power among those three parties shifted over time. The authority and influence of the Zhou court was at its peak in the early Western Zhou period but started to decline since then. After the eighth century BCE., each state was de facto independent politically and the Zhou court became a symbolic institution. Some states were challenged and eventually destroyed by local populations, while others managed to develop new local identities integrating the Zhou and local cultural elements. Some were able to expand their cultural and political influence, while others were constrained by the strength of the local culture from the very beginning. The different futures of each state was related directly to the policy it exercised in the initial period of its establishment in the early Western Zhou period, and to the strength of the local society. THE YAN STATE: ZHOU'S COLONY IN NORTHERN HEBEI Zhou's expansion to the border of the steppe in north China stretched into an area along the Great Wall, which is traditionally called "the Northern Zone" (Fig. 1). The area was occupied by numerous semi-nomadic and nomadic groups who were often conceived as Rong and Di "barbarians" in dynastic records. Unlike the Shang and Zhou, these people did not document their history and thoughts in written forms. Yet, their identities were clearly defined by uniquely designed artifacts in distinctive iconography and style. Archaeological and art historical studies in the past two decades have recognized the economic, cultural, and political significance of the Northern Zone (e.g., Lin, 1987; Linduff, 1997; So and Bunker, 1995). The Yan state was established in northern Hebei, the eastern part of the Northern Zone (see Fig. 1). It was situated east of the Taihang Mountains in the far north of the Zhou court. The area held both military and political significance. It was the northern frontier of the dynastic power where the Zhou could build a frontline defense against hostile northern groups and expand its cultural and political control further in the Northern Zone. At the same time, the area constituted</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 1. The "Northern Zone" of China, showing important site locations. the southern frontier of those northern groups, a place where they could move in and out, interact with, and sometimes challenge the dynastic power. What we know about the Yan primarily comes from the material remains discovered at its capital at Liulihe. Archaeological excavations over three decades at Liulihe have revealed an ancient city, a cemetery with over 200 burials, and finely cast bronze vessels all dated in the Western Zhou period (late eleventh century BCE to earlier eighth century BCE) (BDK BWY, 1996a, 1996b; BWY, 1995; BWY BDKW ZSK, 2000; LK, 1984, 1997; ZSK BWY, 1990). The most exciting discovery was two inscribed bronze vessels, a he and a lei from the burial of a marquis of Yan. Inscriptions on both vessels recorded the investiture ceremony and verbal commission of the enfeoffment of Yan to the Duke of Shao by the Zhou king. Studies of bronzes and inscriptions on them, as well as the mortuary practice at Liulihe suggest that the Yan maintained close cultural and political connections with the Zhou court externally, and at the same time built up alliances internally with the Shang people who were enfeoffed to the Yan (Sun, 2003). The marquis of Yan not only frequently sent his envoys such as Yu and Jin to the court, but also paid court visits himself to reassert Yan's subordination and loyalty to the Zhou king. An inscription on a well-known ding commissioned by Zhi, the marquis of Yan, recorded that Zhi paid his first court visit at Zongzhou (the capital of the Zhou) and received ten strings of cowry shells (currency) as reward from the</page><page sequence="7">Colonizing China's Northern Frontier 165 Zhou king. Zhi thus cast the vessel to commemorate that event (ZQQBW, 1997, catalog no. 3). In return, the Zhou king also sent his representatives to Liulihe to supervise Yan's establishment. One of these representatives was the Duke of Shao, to whom the Yan was enfeoffed. Many scholars believe that the Duke of Shao did not take the position as the marquis of the Yan due to his important duties at the court. Instead, he sent his son to establish the Yan at Liulihe (Chen, 1955; Chen, 3 991; Sun, 1995). A ding commissioned by a xiaocheng, an official of the Yan, mentioned that the Duke of Shao granted him five strings of cowries when the duke visited the Yan (Chen, 1955). These diplomatic and political exchanges formed an important and necessary mechanism through which political ties between the Zhou court and the Yan were reinforced. The Yan also reached out to Shang clans and successfully established political coalitions with them during the early Western Zhou period. The Shang clans were allowed to maintain their own burial customs, such as yaokeng (a rectangular pit dug underneath the waist of the deceased) and dog/human sacrifices at Liulihe. Shang nobles seem to have held high military and political positions as well. They were buried with bronze vessels and accompanied by separate chariot and horse pits, a treatment that many nobles from the Zhou clan were even not granted. Notable members, such as Fu and You, often received gifts from the Marquis of the Yan. Through gift giving, the Yan leaders not only expressed a political recognition and acceptance of Shang elites, but also encouraged them to join the political establishment of the Yan. A branch of the well-known Shang Ji clan might even have kept a fief north of Liulihe in the Niulanshan area (Zhang, 1995). Yan's close relations with the court and the political coalition with the Shang strengthened and expanded its power base. Yan's ambition, however, was not just to establish a stronghold of Zhou power in the northern frontier as the court desired, but further to assimilate and acculturate local groups and eventually bring them into the Zhou cultural and political system. RELATIONS BETWEEN NORTHERN HEBEI AND THE SHANG To understand better the cultural and political makeup of local groups in northern Hebei during the early Western Zhou period, it is necessary to trace their roots back to the Shang dynasty in the later part of the second millennium BCE. The Shang did not have a direct political control in northern Hebei. Interactions between these two parties were carried out in the form of tribute, warfare, and marriage as evidenced by the archaeological remains and the oracle bone inscriptions (Hu, 1970; Yang, 1997; Zheng, 1994). Oracle bone inscriptions show that the Shang called those local communities fang (state). In his study of the political geography of Shang's northern frontier, Zheng (1994) has identified tufang, beifang, and zhaofang as hostile groups to the</page><page sequence="8">166 Sun Shang in northern Hebei. The Shang king seemed to be particularly concerned with tufang, presumably active in the area north of Beijing, or north and south of the Yan Mountains. Charges on oracle bones were frequently asked by the king whether his military campaigns against tufang would receive blessings from the spiritual world (Zheng, 1994). Marriages may have also been conducted between the Shang royal family and women from the local communities. These marriages often had strong political motivations and were manipulated by the Shang and the local groups to establish or reinforce their alliances. Local women married into the Shang were sometimes given a court title fu or "lady," followed by the name of their group. By studying the title of the Shang kings' ladies, Yang (1997) has pointed out that the Yan of the Shang period in northern Hebei had married their women to the Shang court as oracle bone inscriptions mentioned "Fu Yan" or Lady Yan at least eight times. Lady Zhu, one of the consorts of king Wu Ding who reigned in the later part of the thirteenth century BCE, may have come from the Guzhu state located at Lulong, northwest of Hebei (Hu, 1970). Paying tribute was another important form of economic and political ex change between local communities and the Shang. Oracle bone inscriptions sug gest that ox and wild boars were tributes from the Yan. One charge in the divination, for example, recorded "Divined in this spring ox coming from the Yan. The Fifth Month." The Guzhu, was one of the suppliers of tortoise shells, a major material for divination (Hu, 1970). Despite these written records, a comprehensive picture of social and political development in northern Hebei during the Shang period is difficult to reconstruct because of limited archaeological findings. The most important discovery to date is a tomb of a local elite at Liujiahe, northeast of Beijing (Fig. 2; BWG, 1977). This burial, dated from 1400 to 1300 BCE, was furnished with Shang style ritual bronze vessels and gold jewelries in local fashions. The sixteen bronze vessels, including seven cooking vessels (five ding, one //, and one yan), seven wine vessels (one jue, one jia, one you, one lei, one pou and two he), and two pan water vessels, are in typical Shang styles. They were decorated with either simple bowstring patterns or animal face motifs composed of yunlei (thunder and cloud pattern) or wide bands. Similar vessels are widely found in Shang metropolitan areas. This lavish display of Shang style ritual bronzes suggests that their patron, the Liujiahe elite, was fully aware of Shang artistic and ritual practices. No matter where these vessels were cast, the conscious use of exotic Shang ritual paraphernalia is a statement of this region's close communication with the Shang. In addition to Shang style bronzes, the Liujiahe elite was adorned with gold jewelry, including a hairpin, a pair of armlets terminated in the fan shape, and a trumpet-shaped earring. Trumpet-shaped earrings have been frequently found in Shang-dated burials at Xiaoguanzhuang, Tangshang; Liulidian, Fangshan;</page><page sequence="9">and Xueshan, Changping in this area (An, 1954; BDLKJS, 1979; LKG, 1976). These burials are dated slightly earlier than the Liujiahe tomb. Gold jewelries were by no means the favored ornaments of the Shang. However, they were widely used and appreciated by the Lijiaya culture (fourteenth century to eleventh century BCE), an agro-pastoral non-Shang group centered in northern Shaanxi and northwestern Shanxi, an area west of the Taihang Mountains. Gold or naments were likely symbols of wealth and possibly social status in northern Hebei and in the Lijiaya culture. They were only found in relatively rich buri als. Although the style of gold earrings was different, the common love of gold speaks for a shared tradition by people in northern Hebei and of the Lijiaya culture. TWO NEIGHBORS OF THE YAN DURING THE EARLY WESTERN ZHOU PERIOD Literary sources and material remains richly document Shang's contacts with the locals in northern Hebei. However, there is no evidence to suggest Shang's direct political control of the area. This situation was fundamentally changed with the establishment of the Yan at Liulihe. For the first time, the dynastic power, namely the Zhou, set up a colony and intended to penetrate into local communities with an explicit attempt to stay permanently and expand its cultural and political control in the region. As a consequence, local communities faced an immediate</page><page sequence="10">168 Sun and direct challenge from the central power, and needed to make choices to survive culturally and politically. Present available archaeological remains in northern Hebei suggest two dis tinctive local cultures contemporary with the Yan during the early Western Zhou period (see Fig. 2). One was active in the Yan mountainous region, and the other was the Zhangjiayuan culture in the alluvial plan south of the Yan Mountains. The alluvial plain is primarily in the administrative territories of three cities: Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan. This region is therefore referred as Jing, Jin, and Tang. Both cultures had their own signature artifacts of local style, but at the same time adopted Shang and Zhou bronze vessels and cultural practices. The groups in the Yan mountainous region used northern-style bronzes, including bronze daggers and knives ended with pommels of sculptured animal heads. The Zhangjiayuan culture instead favored gold earrings with fan-shaped ends. Local Groups in the Yan Mountainous Region Archaeological remains in the Yan mountainous region are limited. Major discoveries thus far include caches at Chaodaogou, Qinglong and Xiaohenan, Xinglong, and tombs at Baifu, Changping (see Fig. 2). They are dated around the mid-eleventh century BCE, the late Shang, and early Zhou periods (BWG, 1976; HWWG, 1962; Wang, 1990). Caches at Chaodaogou and Xiaohenan have yielded typical northern frontier style, straight-bladed bronze daggers, curved-bladed knives with animal or geo metric pommels, and socketed axes. These objects are the earliest frontier-style bronzes found in northern Hebei to date. The daggers and knives were finely cast and had a clear indication of wearing. They are fashioned with elegantly designed pommel heads in the shape of a simple ring, a jingle, a mushroom, or sculptured animal heads, such as of a deer and a goat (Fig. 3). The eyes of the animals are often highlighted with turquoise. Hilts on these knives and daggers were bordered with diagonal or parallel striations, a northern decorative tradition. Bronze weapons and tools alike appeared predominantly in burials of the Lijiaya culture. Recent art historical studies of northern frontier style bronzes suggest that these weapons and tools were used to express tribal affiliations and individual social standing (So and Bunker, 1995). A rare discovery of an inscribed bronze lid at Xiaohenan indicates that the local population may have had contact with the Shang before the establishment of Yan. The lid, inscribed with zuyi, was dedicated to ancestor Yi, a Shang practice of naming ancestors. A triangular-shaped bronze ge dagger axe from the same cache is also worth mentioning. This kind of ge, categorized as kui by many scholars, was widely used by people at Chenggu and the Yu state in northwestern China during the Shang and early Zhou periods (Lu and Hu, 1988; Tang et al., 1980). The presence of the kui in the cache at Xiaohenan suggests local groups in northern</page><page sequence="11">Colonizing China's Northern Frontier 169 Fig. 3. Northern style bronze knives and daggers from the mountainous region; 1 &amp; 2. bronze knives from Xiaohenan; 3, 4 and 5. bronze knives from Chaodaogou; 6. bronze dagger from Chaodaogou; 7, 8 and 9. bronze daggers from Baifu. Hebei may have had cultural and even tribal affiliations with those active west of the Taihang Mountains in the Shang and Zhou periods. Two burials, M2 and M3, at Baifu, Changping, 70 km north of the Yan capital, Liulihe, are the most important discovery of the culture in the Yan mountainous region to date (BWG, 1976). The burials, dated to around the early Western Zhou period (late eleventh century to early tenth century BCE), belonged to a local fe male (M2) and a male (M3) elite (Li, 1994). Both were interred in pit graves with a north to south orientation. They were furnished with a wooden chamber con structed with pieces of wood cut 3.2 to 3.43 m long and 16 to 20 cm wide, a practice shared by the burials of the Weiyingzi Culture at the Weiyingzi cemetery, north of the Yan Mountains in the western part of Liaoning (Guo, 1987; LBWG, 1977). Northern frontier-style bronzes played a significant role for the parade of power in both elite burials at Baifu. The six straight-bladed bronze daggers from the burials are 25 to 45 cm long and decorated with mushroom-shaped pommels and sculptured horse and raptor heads, typical of northern-frontier styles. These daggers demonstrate clear stylistic connections with the ones from caches at Chaodaogou and Xiaohenan (see Fig. 3). The hilt and pommel of a dagger from burial M3, for example, is almost identical with that of a bronze knife from Xiaohenan. Both objects terminate in a jingle-pommel with strip-shaped openings and a sharp-pointed protrusion at the end. The hilts of both artifacts are fashioned</page><page sequence="12">170 Sun with striations. Other northern-style bronzes, such as a helmet, socketed axes, and shield ornaments from both burials appear for the first time in northern Hebei. Despite the dominance of northern-style bronzes, the influence of Shang and Zhou cultural traditions is apparent. Both burials M2 and M3 were accompanied with bronze vessels of Shang and Zhou styles. Burial M2 features an assemblage of ding, gui, and hu vessels; burial M3 has ding and gui. Except a gui in burial M3, all vessels are plain. The bronze ding and gui assemblage are the hallmark of the Zhou mortuary tradition. The use of ding and gui in a set in burials was typical in the metropolitan area of the Zhou, and was a practice followed by the vassal states. In elite burials of the Yan, for instance, ding and gui were often used in a set. Both burials use yaokeng and/or dog sacrifices, a funerary custom closely associated with the Shang culture. Such practice was widely used by those from the Shang clans in the Yan cemetery at Liulihe. Moreover, fragments of tortoise shells and animal bones were discovered from both burials. These shells and bones were used in divination and processed in the Zhou tradition. Some pieces were inscribed with such characters as qisi, qishang shangxia weiyu, zhen, and buzhi. These characters, written in Shang style, indicate local connections with the Shang. Local Groups on the Plain?the Zhangjiayuan Culture Material remains of local groups in the Jing, Jin, and Tang area, including residential remains of burials and artifacts, have been discovered primarily in the most recent two decades. Scholars interpret these remains differently and define them in various terms as the Third Phase of the Weifang culture, the Upper Zhangjiayuan culture, and the Zhangjiayuan culture (Han and Ji, 1993; Li, 1994; Zhang, 1997). The term "Zhangjiayuan culture" is used here since it is generally preferred. The Zhangjiayuan culture was active roughly from the fourteenth century to the late ninth century BCE. Its diagnostic pottery is floral rimmed // (vessel) with baggy legs. Typical stone tools include polished stone axes, adzes, knives, shovels, and arrowheads. House remains discovered at Zhenjiangying, Fangshan, and Zhangjiayuan, Jixian, were round and semi-subterranean (BWY, 1999; Han and Ji, 1993). At the Zhejingying site, sickles, shovels, hoes, and pestles made of animal bones were found, suggesting that agriculture was an important part of the local economy. Pollen and faunal analyses reveal that animal husbandry and hunting were practiced as well (BWY, 1999). The complexity of the local social organization is unclear. Settlements dis covered so far do not express significant hierarchies in terms of their size and function. However, there are great variations in burial treatments, implying the existence of social hierarchy and status differentiation in the societies. At the Zhangjiayuan site, for example, some burials contain no offerings, while others</page><page sequence="13">Colonizing China's Northern Frontier 171 Fig. 4. Gold and bronze armlets and earrings; 1. gold earrings from burial M3 at Zhangjiayuan; 2. gold earrings from burial M4 at Zhuangjiayuan; 3. bronze earring from the Zhenjiangyingsite; 4. gold armlets from the Liujiahe burial. have several bronze vessels and gold ornaments. Relatively rich burials, which have bronze vessels and/or gold armlets and earrings, have been found at the following six sites: Zhangjiawa, Laishui; Zhangjiayuan and Bangjun, Jixian; Chenshantou, Luanxian; Donggangezhuang, Lulong as well as Xiaoshandong, Qian'an (HW, 1980; Li and Yin, 1995; Meng and Zhao, 1994; TWG QWG, 1997; TLBK, 1990, 1993) (see Fig. 2). Burials at the Zhangjiayuan site exhibit a number of local characteristics. Most burials did not contain pottery. The deceased, rich or poor, were buried in a prone position. Also, the deceased was exclusively oriented to the east, a mortuary custom practiced in this region by the Datuotou culture, the local predecessor of the Zhangjiayuan culture during the early and middle period of the Shang in the first half of the second millennium BCE, and interestingly continued among tribes at Jundushan in the Yan mountainous region mainly in the seventh century and sixth century BCE. Bronze and gold armlets and earrings terminated in fan shapes were popular in the Zhangjiayuan culture (Fig. 4). They have been found in burials at Zhangjiayuan, Donggangezhuang, and Xiaoshandong. One bronze earring is also found from an ash pit at the Zhenjiangying site. The popularity of gold and bronze armlets and earrings indicates that these artifacts carried and expressed a shared cultural tradition in the region. Indeed, gold ornaments were not something foreign to this region. They were found in the middle Shang tomb at Liujiahe mentioned above. The Weiyingzi culture, Zhangjiayuan's contemporary north of the Yan Mountains, also favored bronze and gold fan-shape-ended armlets and earrings. The influence of the Shang and Zhou cultures on the Zhangjiayuan culture was demonstrated by the presence of bronze vessels in burials. Similar to the burials at Baifu, most of the Zhangjiayuan burials featured a bronze ding and gui assemblage as well. The shape and decor of these vessels is typical Shang and early Zhou style (Fig. 5). Furthermore, short inscriptions and clan emblems on</page><page sequence="14">Sun 4 Fig. 5. Bronze vessels ding and gui from burials at Zhangjiayuan; 1. ding from burial M2; 2. ding from burial M3; 3. ding from burial M4; 4. gui from burial M3; 5. gui from burial M4. the bronze vessels suggest their cultural connection with the Zhou. For example, a bronze gui from tomb M4 at Zhangjiayuan bears the anthropomorphic tian character, an emblem of a branch of the Zhou clan. A bronze gui from a middle Western Zhou tomb around early part of the tenth century BCE at Qian'an carries the following inscription "Marquis cast this precious bronze vessel." The marquis mentioned in the inscription likely refers to a marquis of Yan. The style and content of the inscriptions suggests that these vessels were unlikely cast by local elites. DISCUSSION: COOPERATION BETWEEN LOCAL GROUPS AND THE YAN The establishment of the Yan state is a direct result of political strategies the Zhou developed to manage its expanded kingdom. The survival and success of the Yan was in the best interest of both the Yan and the Zhou court. Through frequent political exchanges, the Yan and the Zhou maintained a close political and cultural bond. The Zhou provided continuous moral and material supports for the Yan. The Yan conducted its internal and external affairs largely following the guidelines and principles of the Zhou court, as reflected by its use of bronzes, mortuary practices, the incorporation of the Shang clans into its political elite group, and its contacts with the locals. The establishment of the Yan in northern Hebei changed the local cultural and political landscapes. No matter how benign its intent might be, the Yan was a colony established by the Zhou court in this area to control the land and colonize the local people. It was the first time for the power from the Central Plain to impose a new cultural and political order on local societies.</page><page sequence="15">Colonizing China's Northern Frontier 173 The Yan adopted a soft and inclusive policy toward the local societies in the Yan mountainous region and those of the Zhangjiayuan culture. It reached out to local elites and built alliances with them. There is no evidence of Yan military campaigns against the local populations. Local societies did not pose serious threats to the newly established Yan. Currently available archaeological material fails to suggest the presence of a centralized political power in the area during the early Western Zhou period. The Yan had time and room to put Zhou's policy of cultural tolerance into practice. Local elite culture was heavily influenced by that of the Shang and Zhou. In local elite burials, Zhou style bronze vessels, typically ding and gui vessels, were used, and the Shang mortuary practices, yaokeng and dog sacrifices, were adopted. The Zhou oracle divination was practiced as well. The adoption of bonze vessels by local elites may suggest that they were culturally assimilated, and that their political authority and social status were no longer completely defined by indigenous emblems. Indeed, bronze vessels became the exclusive indicator of social status in elite burials of the Zhangjiayuan culture. Bronze vessels of the Shang have long been appreciated by locals. Shang bronzes and mortuary practices were part of local elite culture before the establishment of the Yan in the area. This experience made it easier for local elites to embrace Zhou bronze vessels and ritual practice. Beyond the elite culture, other local cultural traditions remained largely intact during the early Western Zhou period. Distinctive local characteristics were clearly visible from the material remains of both indigenous cultures. Local groups in the Yan mountainous region widely used northern frontier-style artifacts, such as socketed axes and daggers and knives with animal head, jingle, or ring pommels. The Zhangjiayuan culture favored bronze and gold armlets and earrings terminated in fan shapes and they continued to practice their own mortuary customs, including orienting the deceased to the east and using no pottery. The cooperation between the Yan and the local elites during the early West em Zhou period was mutually beneficial for both parties. Local societies were not in a position to compete with the Yan politically, culturally, or militarily. The cooperation with the Yan allowed local elites to survive politically. It also provided them with a potential new source of power. As reflected in the mortuary contexts, bronze vessels were essential markers for power and prestige in the local com munities. With a good relationship with the powerful Yan, it was easier for local leaders to access and acquire bronzes, which in turn could reinforce their power within the local communities. It is unclear at this moment, however, what duties local communities had to perform for the Yan in return. Both literary sources and archaeological remains at Liulihe and other local sites fail to show whether the Yan required local groups to perform any duties, such as paying tributes and providing military services or labor.</page><page sequence="16">174 Sun The cooperation of local elites enabled the Yan to control local populations indirectly. It became less urgent for the Yan to spend time and resource to con trol local land and populations. The Yan thus were able to focus on its military campaign far north of the Yan Mountains in northeastern China. The Yan es tablished a sub-colony or military post in western Liaoning. At Kazuo and its vicinities, beautifully cast bronze vessels dated from late Shang to Middle West em Zhou period were found in several hoards (KW CDB LB, 1974, 1977). The majority of these bronzes, however, were cast in the early Western Zhou period. Inscriptions on several bronzes indicate that these vessels shared the same patrons, such as Yu, Boju, and Yanhou, with bronzes from Liulihe. It is likely that these bronzes belonged to Yan elites who were stationed in western Liaoning. The ter ritory occupied by the Zhangjiayuan culture was a critical path for Yan's travel to western Liaoning. The alluvial plain is better suited for the transportation of troops, provisions, and supplies. Maintaining a friendly relationship with the local societies in the plain was important for the success of Yan's control of western Liaoning. The political landscape of northern Hebei and the relationship between the Yan and the local groups may have experienced a dramatic change after the early Western Zhou period. During the following middle and late Western Zhou period, the Yan seemed to suffer serious setbacks and even to struggle for its own survival in the area. Its material remains during this period are largely absent in northern Hebei. Its military presence in western Liaoning was abruptly terminated no later than the middle Western Zhou period. Even at Liulihe, evidence suggests that it was probably abandoned as the capital of the Yan after the middle Western Zhou period (Liu and Zhao, 1997). Indeed, the whereabouts of the Yan in the later period of the Western Zhou still remain elusive archaeologically. What could force the once dominant Yan state to give up its capital during the middle and late Western Zhou period? It is likely that the military and po litical strength of local and northern groups had increased through time, which eventually led to the shift of power between the Yan and those groups. Indeed, during the following Spring and Autumn period around the seventh and sixth centuries BCE, one of the local groups, shanrong, was strong and able to launch serious attacks against the Yan. Historical texts record that the shanrong was so powerful that the Duke Huan of the Qi state, the strongest among all vassal states at that time, had to organize an all-out military campaign against it in order to save the Yan state (Sima, 1959). The Yan survived, thrived, and eventually re emerged to become one of the seven strongest states during the Warring States period.</page><page sequence="17">Colonizing China's Northern Frontier 175 CONCLUSION The establishment of the Yan in northern Hebei during the early Western Zhou period opened a new chapter of local history. The Yan, as a colony of the Zhou, represented the attempt by the political power from the Central Plain to colonize and control the local population and the land in northern Hebei. Political agendas were consistent between the Yan and the Zhou court during the early Western Zhou period. The Yan maintained a strong political tie with the Zhou court. It constructed a political coalition with the Shang internally to consolidate and expand its cultural and political base. Contemporary with the Yan were two local cultures, the group in the Yan mountainous region and the Zhangjiayuan culture. The Yan reached out to local elites of both cultures, and local elite culture was penetrated by the Yan. Bronze vessels became an essential indicator of power and status in the local societies. Other local cultural traditions, however, were largely preserved during the early Western Zhou period. Through alliance and cooperation, local elites continued to enjoy their political privileges, and the Yan was able to control the local population and focus its priorities on military campaigns and the expansion in its northeastern frontier.
