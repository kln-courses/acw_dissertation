<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> C H A P T E R  4 From Epilogue to Prologue:  Chaos and the Arrow of Time l y a  P r i g o g i n e  and Isabelle Stengers’s Order out o f  Chaos (1984)  I should carry a warning label: “ c a u t i o n :  Use at own risk. Au- thors have speculated beyond data. Conclusions are conjectural.”  The disclaimer is necessary because this book is not, as it may ap- pear to be, simply a popularized version of the new sciences. Rather,  it is an ambitious synthesis that goes well beyond what many scien- tists working in chaos theory would be willing to grant are legiti- mate inferences from their work. As speculative theory, it attempts  to define the deeper significance— one might almost say the meta- physics— of an emerging area of research. At issue is whether chaos  should be associated with the breakdown of systems or with their  birth. Viewed as the epilogue to life, chaos almost inevitably has  negative connotations. Seen as prologue, it takes on more positive  evaluations. At the center of Prigogine and Stengers’s project is their view of  how the new science relates to time. According to them, chaos the- ory provides a resolution to the long-standing philosophical debate  about whether being or becoming is the essential reality. They point  out that classical physics imagines the universe as reversible, able to  move either backward or forward in time. The biological and hu- man sciences, by contrast, locate themselves within an irreversible  world of birth and mortality. Prigogine and Stengers see thermo- 9 1 </page> <page sequence="2"> 9Z Something out of Nothing dynamics as forming a natural bridge between these views. At equi- librium, thermodynamic equations are classical in the sense that they  are reversible, but far from equilibrium they are irreversible and  hence bound to a one-way direction in time. A thermodynamics that  integrates reversibility with irreversibility would, they assert, allow  being and becoming finally to be reconciled. Even from this brief summary, the reader can appreciate the dis- parity between the sweep of the theoretical claims and the technical  basis on which they rest. To imagine that profound philosophical  questions can or should be answered by advances in irreversible  thermodynamics is apt to evoke uneasiness among most scientists  and outright skepticism among humanities scholars. Yet there have  been scientific theories that have significantly affected social atti- tudes— evolution, relativity, and quantum mechanics, for example.  Whether chaos theory will have this kind of impact remains to be  seen. Even more problematic, in my view, is whether the new para- digms are causes of social change or are themselves reflections of  larger cultural currents. In light of these uncertainties, it is especially  important to be clear about what different research programs within  the sciences of chaos have accomplished, and what they have so far  merely promised or suggested. The even tone in which Order O ut o f  Chaos is written does not  encourage this distinction. Facts that have been extensively verified  are presented in the same manner as speculations backed by little or  no experimental confirmation. Only once do Stengers and Prigogine  acknowledge that some of their scientific claims are conjectural. At  the end of the chapter on microscopic interpretations of irrever- sibility, they add a “word of caution” that “experiments are in prep- aration to test these views,” and as “long as they have not been  performed, a speculative element is unavoidable” (p. 290). The im- plication, of course, is that the “speculative element” waits only on  the completion of experiments to be removed. Since no attempt is  made in the chapter to identify why, or even what, points are spec- ulative, the lay reader has no way to evaluate the claim that experi- mental confirmation is forthcoming. The “word of caution” is just  that— a brief comment added as an afterthought, not an acknowl- edgment that many of the chapter’s conclusions are controversial. Additional difficulties are presented by an inference many readers  have drawn from Order out o f  Chaos, that Prigogine is as central to </page> <page sequence="3"> From Epilogue to Prologue 5*3 chaos theory as Darwin was to evolution or Einstein to relativity. To  someone who works in the field, it appears that Prigogine’s work  has supplied a few rooms in a large building. Certainly he did not  establish the building’s architecture, nor did he single-handedly lay  the foundation. To be fair, the misapprehension is not entirely his  fault. It is perhaps understandable that in a text he co-authored, his  research would be foregrounded and other research programs re- ported as though they merely provided corroborating evidence for  his thesis. Nevertheless, the imbalance implicit in Order out o f   Chaos should be pointed out and corrected, not replicated. Despite these problems, Order out o f  Chaos is an important  work. It is frequently cited by scholars interested in connections be- tween literature and science because it is one of the very few texts  available that attempt to explain the new sciences in words rather  than equations. Moreover, the research it reports is interesting and  worthwhile, independent of its philosophical significance. But as we  shall see, its most important claims have to do with changes in  world view rather than shifts in scientific theorizing. To see how  these claims emerge, it will be necessary to review Prigogine’s contri- butions to irreversible thermodynamics. For that we need to return  to the second law of thermodynamics. As we saw in chapter 2, the second law led to predictions of a  “heat death” in which the universe, having exhausted all heat reser- voirs, degenerates to a state of maximum dissipation. This scenario  contrasts sharply with the spontaneous increase of organization in  living organisms, as in the increasing differentiation of an embryo.  Twenty years after Kelvin formulated the idea of “universal dissipa- tion,” he agonized in print over whether living organisms were an  exception to it. He finally concluded it was futile to worry about the  matter. “But the real phenomena of life infinitely transcend human  science,” he wrote, “and speculating regarding consequences of their  imagined reversal is utterly unprofitable” (1911: 12). The apparent  discrepancy between entropie decay and biological complexity can  be reconciled when one recognizes that the second law applies only  to closed systems, whereas all living organisms are open systems that  continually receive energy from outside themselves. Nevertheless, the  contrast was troubling to Kelvin, and remained so for many thermo-  dynamicists. Biologists, for their part, tended to feel that thermo- dynamics was largely irrelevant to their concerns. </page> <page sequence="4"> 94 Something out of Nothing Prigogine gave a new twist to this old problem by reformulating  the way entropy production takes place. He reasoned that the over- all entropy term can be divided into two parts. The first reflects  exchanges between the system and the outside world; the second  describes how much entropy is produced inside the system itself. The  second law requires that the sum of these two parts be positive,  except at equilibrium, when it is zero. But if the system is very far  from equilibrium, the first term will be so overwhelmingly positive  that even i f  the second term is negative, the sum can still be positive.  This means that, without violating the second law, systems far from  equilibrium can experience a local entropy decrease. For systems of  interest to Prigogine, this decrease manifests itself as a dramatic in- crease in internal organization. To foreground the connection be- tween self-organizing processes and large entropy production, Pri- gogine called such reactions “dissipative” systems (Nicolis and  Prigogine, 1977). He knew that for Kelvin and other thermodynami-  cists, this word connoted waste, decline, and death. By using it to  denote the spontaneous appearance of organized structure, Prigogine  emphasized the important positive role that entropy production can  play. The problem then was to understand how self-organization takes  place. Extensive research was undertaken on such chemical pro- cesses as the Belousov-Zhabotinskii (BZ) reaction, which exhibits  dramatic and highly organized structures far from equilibrium. The  primary and secondary reactions involved in the BZ reaction are  complex, but the reaction itself is not difficult to produce. All one  needs is a petri dish that contains bromate and cerium ions in an  acidic medium. The reaction is sufficiently dramatic to warrant de- scribing it as if we were there. What would we see? Initially the solution appears homogeneous. Suddenly a colored  ring forms near the dish’s center and begins to pulsate, spreading  outward toward the perimeter.1 We discover that if we jiggle the 'The ring is visible because the catalyst for the reaction is a colorimetric indicator.  A distinctive feature of the BZ reaction is that the catalyst for the reaction is pro- duced by the reaction itself. When a reaction product feeds back into the reaction in  this way, the reaction is said to be autocatalyzing. The feedback loops involved in  auto- and cross-catalyzation are characteristic of self-organizing reactions. They pro- vide the mechanisms necessary for the reactions to vacillate between intermediate  stages, instead of proceeding immediately from reactants to products. </page> <page sequence="5"> From Epilogue to Prologue 5)5 dish, ruffle our beards over it (as chemists of old used to do), or  drop in dust particles, other rings form and fight with the first ring  for dominance. Usually the ring oscillating at the highest frequency  wins, progressively destroying the waves of lower-frequency oscilla- tors until it is the only one to remain. If we dip a pencil into the dish  and “break” a ring, it transforms into a spiral that begins to spin.  We find that these fascinating displays do not last very long. As  secondary reactions drain the chemicals away from the primary re- actions, the displays gradually fade. Setting up the reaction again,  this time we stir the reaction. We discover that the continuously  stirred reaction creates a display that can sustain itself indefinitely.  The stirred solution is originally homogeneous, as the first reaction  was. Soon, however, the solution flashes blue, then red, then blue  again, at regular intervals. We are seeing a second version of the BZ  reaction that produces a so-called chemical clock. Self-organizing reactions have been known for some time; the BZ  reaction was recognized in Russia about thirty years ago by the two  chemists who gave their names to it, Belousov and Zhabotinskii.  Prigogine did not invent these reactions. Nor did he do the pioneer- ing work of cataloguing their remarkably various forms; the credit  for this work goes to Arthur Winfree and others.2 What Prigogine  did was create a metaphysics that places these reactions at the center  of a new view of how order emerges. Prigogine demonstrated mathe- matically that when initial concentrations of the reactants are large,  the solution becomes unstable, and local fluctuations appear in the  concentration of reagents.3 Past some critical point, these micro- scopic fluctuations correlate with other fluctuations spatially re- moved from them and become the central points from which arise  the macroscopic rings and spirals of the BZ reaction. Prigogine and  Stengers represent this coordination as macroscopic concentrations  “instructing” local regions to engage in a process of self-organiza- 2For a review of the BZ reaction, see Arthur T.

Prigogine’s explanation is distinct from previous explanations be- cause it does not rely on specific reaction mechanisms, such as ste-  reospecificity, to explain how self-organization takes place. If any- thing, Prigogine and Stengers overemphasize this aspect of  Prigogine’s work, implying that it is extraordinary, even miraculous,  that millions of individual molecules can “communicate” in such a  way as to make macroscopic structures possible. Because they do  not distinguish clearly between communication unique to living be- ings and “communication” between molecules, the rhetoric of Order  out o f  Chaos takes on an anthropomorphic quality quite different  from what one finds in most articles on chaos. With this general background, we are now ready to consider what  Prigogine and Stengers call the “leitmotif” of their text, the integra- tion of being and becoming. Even a casual reading reveals that the  chapter on microscopic irreversibility is crucial to the book’s argu- ment. Throughout earlier chapters, important questions are deferred  to it; afterward, frequent references are made back to it. The chapter  is indeed central, for it undertakes to integrate the timeless world of  classical physics with the time-bound world of biology and chemis- try. At issue is whether time’s one-way direction is intrinsic to reality  or an artifact of the observer. In tackling the question, Prigogine and Stengers attempt to  strengthen the case for time’s irreversibility by reinterpreting the sec- ond law. The second law is involved because it gives time its arrow  by defining “forward” as the direction of increasing entropy. Sup- pose you see a movie in which scattered pool balls magically reas- semble into the triangular shape of the rack. You know the film is  being run backward, because in real life systems never work like  this. Chocolate poured into milk never spontaneously sorts itself  into syrup again; ink smudged on a page never flows back again into  a single clean line. These results are consistent with the second law’s  decree that entropy always tends to increase in closed systems. It is  important to understand that this tendency is not predicted by classi- cal physics. In Newton’s equations of motion, negative time can be  substituted for positive time and the equations still hold true. As far  as Newton was concerned, time could run backward. The same is </page> <page sequence="7"> From Epilogue to Prologue 5*7 true for the special theory of relativity; it too treats time as a two-  way street. Only the second law puts a point on time’s arrow. For years scientists and philosophers had pondered whether time’s  forward direction was merely very probable or absolute. The ques- tion arose because it was not clear whether the second law was a  generalization about what would probably happen or intrinsic to  microscopic reality. If the second law was merely probable, then the  forward motion of time had an unavoidable subjective element. To  see why, consider the pool-ball example again. Once the balls have  been scattered from their original triangular formation, for time to  run backward they must collide in just the right way so as to form  the triangle again. If they form any other pattern (or no pattern at  all), from our point of view time would not be running backward.  The probability that this one specific pattern will occur is infinitesi-  mally small, because it is only one of millions of possibilities. Al- though nothing inherent in physical reality causes time to move in  one direction, it goes forward and not backward because the proba- bility for events to happen in a myriad of different ways is infinitely  greater than for them to happen in one way. And why must things  happen in just this way? Because our knowledge defines the triangu- lar pattern, and only the triangular pattern, as “past.” Hence the  necessity for time to move forward is in this view inherently subjec- tive, an artifact of the observer’s presence. Prigogine and Stengers try to refute this argument by locating irre- versibility in microscopic reality rather than in the observer’s knowl- edge. They assert that once the balls are dispersed, the information  the triangular form represents has been dissipated. For the pool balls  to reassemble, they would have to “communicate” with each other  about position, momentum, trajectory, and so on, so that all the  different motions would be coordinated in just the right way. Even  for a few pool balls, the volume of information involved is very  large. If the entire universe were to run backward, it would be essen- tially infinite. Thus Prigogine and Stengers conclude that time can go  only forward because an infinite information barrier divides past  from present. In this view the second law is as much a statement  about lost information as it is about dissipated energy. Just as some  energy is dissipated in every real heat exchange, so some information  is lost in every real matter/energy exchange. </page> <page sequence="8"> 5&gt;8 Something out of Nothing To see the force of this argument, imagine that when the balls  begin retracing their trajectories, your body experiences a similar  reversal of all the processes that occurred during the time you  watched the balls disperse. If time could pivot and begin running  backward in this way, you would be growing younger while the  balls were reassembling. For this to happen, each particle in your  body which had been involved in a collision while the balls were  dispersing would have to “communicate” with every other particle it  hit, so that all of these collisions could now happen in reverse. This  would require millions more bits of information than the pool balls  needed for their reassembly. If not just you and the balls but every- one else in the world was experiencing a similar reversal, the infor- mation required would be unthinkably enormous. Even so, we  would have accounted for just a few minutes in the lives of just one  species on one smallish planet in one galaxy. For time to run back- ward throughout the universe, the information would be so stag- geringly huge that it is easy to see why Prigogine and Stengers call it  an infinite barrier. The problem with time going backward, then, is  not just in the observer’s knowledge. Rather, it is in the massive  correlation of information necessary to have collisions on every  level, from subatomic particles to cars on a California freeway to  meteorites striking Jupiter, reverse themselves. To make this argument, Prigogine and Stengers find it convenient  to introduce the idea (developed by Ludwig Boltzmann in the late  nineteenth century) of correlated and uncorrelated particles. Before  two particles collide, they have no necessary correlation with each  other. The collision might or might not occur, depending on every- thing happening around them. The BMW might or might not hit the  Honda, depending on whether the Chevette manages to swing  around the truck blocking the path ahead of them. But once the  BMW has hit the Honda, these two cars must be correlated if a time  reversal is to occur; and all the collisions that preceded that collision  must also be correlated, on every level, back to the beginning of  time. When time goes forward there is a role for chance, because  small or random fluctuations near a bifurcation point can cause a  system to take a different path than it otherwise would. Whether the  Chevette misses the truck could depend on whether a butterfly flut- tering nearby distracts the driver’s attention for a second. But when </page> <page sequence="9"> From Epilogue to Prologue 99 time runs backward along the same track it took before, every junc- ture point is already predetermined, and hence chance can play no  further part in the system’s evolution. The introduction of chance hints at what is at stake in this argu- ment. Compared to the question whether death is inevitable, the de- bate over whether the second law is an artifact of the observer or  rooted in microscopic irreversibility may seem trivial. Prigogine and  Stengers’s point, however, is that these concerns are very much re- lated. Humankind has always sought ways to come to terms with its  mortality, and one of the ways that figured importantly in the his- tory of science was to envision reality as a timeless realm purged of  the irreversible changes that mark human experience. Prigogine and  Stengers imply that, on a deep level, this view of reality was moti- vated by a desire to escape from an existence that seemed all too  vulnerable to the vagaries of chance. Few have felt the appeal of a timeless realm more deeply than  Einstein. In his famous mediation on the “Temple of Science,” Ein- stein speculated that the scientist or artist is attracted to his vocation  because he is in flight from everyday life with its painful harshness and wretched  dreariness, and from the fetters of one’s own shifting desires. A per- son with a finer sensibility is driven to escape from personal existence  and to the world of objective observing and understanding. This mo- tive can be compared with the longing that irresistibly pulls the town-  dweller away from his noisy, cramped quarters and toward the silent,  high mountains, where the eye ranges freely through the still, pure air  and traces the calm contours that seem to be made for eternity. With this negative motive there goes a positive one. Man seeks to  form for himself, in whatever manner is suitable for him, a simplified  and lucid image of the world, and so to overcome the world of experi- ence by striving to replace it to some extent by this image. [Einstein,  1 954: 2 2 4 - 2 2 7 ] It may seem strange that these lines were written by the man who  formulated relativity theory. However, Einstein was led to relativity  precisely because he saw it as the only way to preserve the overall  invariance of physical laws. Before he settled on “relativity,” he had  considered calling his discovery the “theory of invariance.” The ap- peal that he felt in “the calm contours that seem to be made for  eternity” can be sensed when one looks at a Minkowski diagram of </page> <page sequence="10"> t o o  Something out of Nothing spacetime.4 Because time is one of the coordinates presented for in- spection, there is a tendency to feel one is looking at reality from an  eternal viewpoint. The illusion speaks to the strong sense Einstein  had of a scientific model as a “simplified and lucid image of the  world,” beautiful in its exactness and clarity. From this perspective, the assertion that the second law is an arti- fact of subjective experience is crucial. For if, on the contrary, the  second law were intrinsic to reality, then irreversible change would  be inextricably woven into the fabric of the universe, and it would  be impossible to maintain (or create) an anywhen free from the taint  of mortality. The subtext for the debate over the second law is thus  a struggle over how one is to see reality on a fundamental level:  bombarded by chance, subject to decay, headed toward death; or  existing in a timeless realm where chance and irreversibility are  merely subjective illusions. We can now understand the full scope of the intervention Pri-  gogine and Stengers want to make in Chaos out o f  Order. They  insist that since irreversible events are demonstrably part of the  world, in fact a much larger part than reversible ones, we must rec- ognize that the view of classical physics is at best incomplete. More- over, they suggest that the price paid for this classical perspective is  alienation, for a timeless realm is a world divorced from human ex- perience. In its place they offer a vision that they find both truer to  reality and less alienating for the human spirit. The essential change  is to see chaos as that which makes order possible. Life arises not in  spite but because of dissipative processes that are rich in entropy  production. Chaos is the womb of life, not its tomb. There is evidence to support this view. Estimates indicate that the  time required for life to arise if it relied purely on random sequenc- ing of amino acids would be far longer than the present age of the  universe (Madore and Freedman, 1987: 253). The probability, then,  is that some kind of self-organizing process arose from chance fluc- tuations. The self-organizing process was able to proceed much 4Hermann Minkowski, a mathematician, was the first to realize that Einstein’s  special theory of relativity implied a four-dimensional spacetime. In 1908 he pre- dicted that “space by itself and time by itself are doomed to fade away into mere  shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality”  (“Space and Time,” in The Principles o f  Relativity  [New York: Dover, 1908]). </page> <page sequence="11"> From Epilogue to Prologue 101 more quickly than random sequencing because it possessed the abil- ity to create and replicate form. From this perspective, one could say  that the second law in a sense created life, for only a world rich in  dissipative processes would have been able to support self-organiza-  tion. To make the second law intrinsic to reality is in this view com- forting rather than threatening, for it suggests that the evolution of  life was not an accident but a response to the essential structure of  the cosmos. This is why Prigogine and Stengers do not want to concede objec- tivity to those who, like Einstein, privilege a universe where irrevers- ible change is an illusion. Instead, they imagine a world that is both  “objective and participatory” (p. 299). They imply that we can  know the world because it is constituted through the same processes  that created and continue to govern human life. The passage they  quote from Merleau-Ponty about a “truth within situations” aptly  summarizes their position: As long as I keep before me the ideal of an absolute observer, of  knowledge in the absence of any viewpoint, I can only see my situa- tion as being a source of error. But once I have acknowledged that  through it I am geared to all actions and all knowledge that are mean- ingful to me, and that it is gradually filled with everything that may  be for me, then my contract with the social in the finitude of my  situation is revealed to me as the starting point of all truth, including  that of science and, since we have some idea of the truth, since we are  inside truth and cannot get outside it, all that I can do is define a truth  within the situation. [Prigogine and Stengers, 1984: 299] Merleau-Ponty of course speaks from the perspective of a psychol- ogist and phenomenologist, so it is perhaps not surprising that he  would think in terms of a “contract with the social.” It is a further  stretch for Prigogine and Stengers to associate chemical processes  with social reality. Yet their rhetoric is designed to make such a  passage easy or plausible. On a deep level, this is no doubt why they  tend to write about chemical reactions in anthropomorphic terms.  They would make common cause with theorists within the human  sciences who challenge totalizing views and celebrate the aleatory  and stochastic. Although they approach the subject with a light  touch, Prigogine and Stengers clearly agree with Michel Serres that  implicit in traditional scientific objectivity is a will toward mastery </page> <page sequence="12"> i o z  Something out of Nothing which feeds on the illusion that the world is separate from us.5 Only  if we blinded ourselves to the complex feedback loops characteristic  of self-organizing structures could we think that we could exploit  and dominate others without ourselves being profoundly affected by  these actions. These are heady conclusions. And if they are based solely on the  scientific data Prigogine and Stengers present, they are shaky ones.  Not only does their argument go far beyond the scientific data; it  does not sit altogether easily with the data. Recall that the center- piece of their interpretation of the second law is the infinite informa- tion barrier separating past from future. Yet their analysis of self- organizing structures emphasizes the seemingly miraculous way in  which millions of molecules can “communicate” with one another.  If molecules can engage in “communication” to build self-organizing  structures, why can they not “communicate” to cause time to go  backward? One could respond, of course, that self-organizing struc- tures have been observed in nature, and that time reversal has not  (at least not unequivocally). But this is to place the case on an empir- ical rather than a theoretical basis, which is precisely the aspect of  traditional interpretations of the second law they were trying to  overcome. A further difficulty arises from the way Prigogine and Stengers  group together research programs that are quite different in their  assumptions, methodologies, and conclusions, as though all of this  research points unambiguously toward an order-out-of-chaos para- digm. For example, they mention Feigenbaum’s one-dimensional  mappings (discussed in chapter 6) without bothering to explain the  nontrivial differences that exist between mappings and multidimen- sional phase diagrams, much less between mappings and the chemi- cal systems that form the basis for their own work (p. 169). Yet  connections can be and indeed have been made between self-orga- nizing processes and dynamical systems theory. Roux, Rossi, Bache-  lart, and Vidal (1980) have written about the BZ reaction in terms  of its being a “strange attractor” ; Hudson and Mankin (1981) have 'Prigogine and Stengers contributed a long commentary on Michel Serres’s essay  “Lucretius: Science and Religion,” in Hermes: Literature, Science, Philosophy (Bal- timore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1982). </page> <page sequence="13"> From Epilogue to Prologue 103 discussed the chaotic behavior of the well-stirred version of the reac- tion; and Simoyi, Wolf, and Swinney (1982) have compared the be- havior of the BZ reaction to period doubling in one-dimensional  maps. However, there is an obvious and important difference be- tween these analyses and Prigogine and Stengers’s approach. Pri- gogine and Stengers emphasize that a large entropy production re- sults in the creation of macroscopic structures where none had  existed before. In strange-attractor analyses, the form is considered  to be encoded within the information the system produces, but these  patterns do not necessarily result in stable, self-replicating structures  as such. I want to emphasize that these are criticisms of Prigogine and  Stengers’s presentation, not of the importance of self-organizing  structures. Since Order out o f  Chaos was written (the original  French version appeared in 1979), significant advances have been  made in understanding how self-organization occurs and how the  simpler systems can be modeled. Madore and Freedman (1987) have  created two-dimensional computer simulations of the BZ reaction  using a cellular automata model that has suggestive implications for  some of the larger issues Pirgogine and Stengers raise. It may be  helpful to compare and contrast this research with the claims of Or- der out o f  Chaos, for it illustrates how a more conservative, non-  philosophical approach nevertheless supports the overall thesis  about the importance of self-organizing reactions. At the same time,  this approach reveals how many links are missing from the causal  chain Prigogine and Stengers would forge between the mechanics of  self-organizing reactions and a metaphysical privileging of becoming  over being. In the cellular automata approach, the simulation space is divided  into cells, and each cell is assigned to one of three states: active,  receptive, or quiescent. An active cell can excite an adjacent cell if  the adjacent cell is in a receptive state. After a prescribed time, active  cells decay into quiescence. After a still longer time, quiescent cells  can become receptive again. These sequencing rules mean that active  states cannot propagate into areas that are already active, nor can  they propagate into quiescent areas. Suppose that, in the center of the simulation space where all the  cells are in a receptive state, a single cell is made active. Excitation </page> <page sequence="14"> 104 Something out of Nothing will spread outward in a circle from this point. Because active cells  decay into quiescence, the cells closest to the point of excitation will  quickly become quiescent and will be unable to be activated again  immediately. This process provides a “pushing” force that makes the  circle into a ring and keeps it radiating outward. If the ring is dis- turbed or fractured along its perimeter, spiral arms appear of the  form observed in the BZ reaction. Virtually all of the spectacular  displays observed in the BZ reaction can be recreated by this simple  model (Cohen, Neu, and Rosales, 1978; Duffy, Britton, and M ur- ray, 1980). Recent work has expanded the approach to three-dimen-  sional models of the BZ reaction (Welsh, Gomatom, and Burgess,  1983; Winfree and Strogatz, 1985). This propagating mechanism may explain how complex spatial  organizations can spontaneously come into existence. Spiral forms  similar to those observed in the BZ reaction have been found, for  example, in nerve axons (Madore and Freedman, 1987), in the lens  of the firefly’s compound eye (Winfree, 1980), and in slime mold  aggregations (Newall and Ross, 1982). This last example is partic- ularly interesting because it is possible to observe the spiral configu- rations as they form. Slime molds reproduce through spores, each of  which is a one-celled organism. As long as there is abundant food in  the environment, the mold stays in this form. As soon as the food  supply is exhausted, however, the spores swarm together and take  on specialized functions, eventually forming a stalk that in turn gives  out spores again. A crucial step in the mold’s transformation from  randomly distributed cells to a complex organized structure is the  formation of spiral configurations around the individual spores.  Thus it appears that the morphogenic tranformation is achieved  through a self-propagating process similar in configuration to the  BZ reaction. A cellular automata model has also been used to explain large-  scale spatial organizations, such as the spiral arms of a disk galaxy  (Mueller and Arnett, 1976). Of course, many more perturbations are  present in galactic systems than in the small petri dishes where the  BZ reaction takes place. To account for these perturbations, stochas- tic elements are introduced into the simulation, giving the spiral  arms the “raggedness” characteristic of galaxy formations. The  claim of researchers who model systems in this way is not that these </page> <page sequence="15"> From Epilogue to Prologue i o j formations are all the same, only that they employ mechanisms that  are similar in that they achieve a “pushing” force through the inter- play among active, receptive, and quiescent areas. The forces respon- sible for creating these spatial gradients in interstellar gases are ob- viously very different from those responsible for giving the BZ  reaction its characteristic forms. The models thus suggest how mor- phogenesis can occur, but they do not explain the particular forces  at work in a given situation. As we shall see in chapter 7, this kind of modeling is typical of  dynamical systems methods. The procedure raises questions about  what it means to model a system, and ultimately about the nature of  scientific explanation. The fact that these models have little or no  relation to specific mechanisms makes it easier to justify injecting  stochastic elements into them, for the absence of a causal explana- tion makes the intrusion of chance conceivable at any point. Thus  Prigogine and Stengers’s valorization of chance is implicit in these  modeling procedures, although in dynamical systems methods it is  presented as a pragmatic technique rather than as a philosophical  revolution. Given Prigogine’s interest in the arrow of time, it is perhaps not  surprising that he would turn to cosmology, for the fundamental  parameters of the universe were no doubt set at its birth. Edgard  Gunzig, Jules Geheniau, and he have recently proposed a model that  makes the order-out-of-chaos dynamic intrinsic to the formation of  the cosmos (1987). This model imagines that at the very beginning  of the universe, fluctuations in the quantum vacuum stabilized them- selves in the form of small black holes, which in turn became the  matter generators necessary to explain why there is something rather  than nothing. “As far as energy is concerned,” Prigogine and his co- authors write, “the creation of the universe from a Minkowskian  [quantum] vacuum is indeed a ‘free lunch’” (p. 623). In this model,  the scenario Kelvin imagined for the universe is completely reversed.  “Heat death” occurs at the beginning rather than the end of time.  Thus the transformation of entropy from epilogue to prologue is  complete, and chaos is reinstated as our primordial parent. To see how the model works, it will be useful to explore some of  the questions left unanswered by big-bang cosmologies. A big-bang  model predicts that residual background radiation would be left </page> <page sequence="16"> i o 6  Something out of Nothing over from the explosion. This radiation was found (inadvertently) by  Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson in 1965, when they were testing a  very sensitive microwave detector for Bell Laboratories and could  not get rid of residual noise. No matter in which direction they  pointed the detector, the noise remained the same, an indication that  it must be coming from outside the atmosphere. Moreover, the radi- ation remained at the same level, regardless of the time of day or  year it was measured. Penzias and Wilson eventually realized that  they were detecting the background radiation predicted by big-bang  cosmologies. But the extraordinary constancy of the background ra- diation was a surprise. Repeated observations have confirmed that it  does not vary by more than one part in ten thousand. This consis- tency is striking evidence for the so-called cosmological principle—  the premise that the universe is isotropic (that is, does not vary with  the axis of observation) and homogeneous. Why it is surprising that the background radiation should be so  uniform? According to the theory of relativity, if light cannot reach  a region, nothing else can either, because nothing can travel faster  than the speed of light. There would not have been time in the early  universe for light from one region to travel to all the other regions,  and vice versa. Why then should the background radiation be con- stant throughout the universe, since the various regions could not  have communicated with each other to achieve equilibrium? And  why, in contrast to the remarkable homogeneity of the background  radiation, should matter be clumped into stars and galaxies? To answer these questions, Alan Guth and others proposed a  “new inflationary cosmology,” in which the universe was supposed  to have expanded initially at an exponentially greater rate than it  does at present.6 The increased expansion rate of an inflationary cos- mology means that a large part of the universe’s present dimensions  would have been achieved in a mere fraction of a second— that is, in  a much, much shorter time than if the expansion rate remained un- changed. Therefore light would have had time to travel throughout '’Although the universe is still expanding today, it is doing so at a decreasing rate.  One of the unanswered questions of contemporary cosmology is whether the uni- verse will eventually stop expanding and begin to contract. Prigogine’s model pre- dicts that the expansion will continue, causing the universe to generate new matter in  the far future. </page> <page sequence="17"> From Epilogue to Prologue 107 the universe, and thus we have an explanation for why the universe  is isotropic and homogeneous. Although it answered some of the questions left unresolved by the  big bang, the new inflationary cosmology raised new questions of its  own. Since the expansion rate is presumed to have changed, some  mechanism is needed to explain why it slowed down. The explana- tions that were advanced relied on special circumstances that looked  suspiciously like special pleading. These problems led Stephen  Hawking, in A Brief History o f  Time (1988), to pronounce “the new  inflationary model dead as a scientific theory, although a lot of peo- ple do not seem to have heard of its demise and are still writing  papers as if it were viable” (p. 132). Among the people who believe  reports of its death to be greatly exaggerated are Gunzig, Geheniau,  and Prigogine. Ironically, they use ideas Hawking helped develop to  overcome objections to an inflationary cosmology. Hawking points out that although the general theory of relativity  leads to predictions of a big bang, the theory cannot be considered a  complete explanation of why a big bang would occur, for two rea- sons. First, it imagines a situation in which particles would be so  tightly squeezed together that interactions between them could not  be ignored, making quantum mechanics necessary. Second, it con- cedes that under the kind of compression the big bang imagines, the  known laws of physics would break down. Hawking was looking  for a way to combine quantum mechanics with relativistic cosmol- ogy when he was led to the realization that black holes could emit  radiation. In this case, as he puts it, “black holes ain’t so black.” Black holes are relevant to big-bang cosmologies because both  represent singularities in spacetime. A black hole is formed when a  star larger than a certain mass begins to burn out. Without the fuel  to maintain itself, the star experiences massive gravitational collapse,  and the matter within it becomes extremely dense. This dense matter  in turn creates a gravitational field so intense that it creates a singu- larity in the curvature of spacetime. To visualize this process, imag- ine pushing the point of a pencil into an inflated balloon (but not so  hard that the balloon breaks). The balloon represents the normal  curvature of spacetime. The indentation into which the now-invisi- ble pencil point disappears represents the black hole. The pencil  point rests on the bottom of the black hole, the point of the singu- </page> <page sequence="18"> io8  Something out of Nothing larity where the gravitational field is most intense. On the balloon’s  surface can be seen an indented circular area whose curvature be- comes steeper as it disappears inward. For a black hole, the circum- ference of this curved area is called the event horizon. Once light or  anything else goes past the event horizon, the curvature is so steep  that it will never be able to escape. Hence the circumference of the  event horizon defines what can happen near the black hole and still  remain knowable. Once inside the event horizon, events are intrin- sically unknowable because light, and hence any other information,  cannot escape the gravitational field to return to an observer. Hawking introduces the idea that black holes might not be black  by asking what would happen if we threw something high in en- tropy— say, a box full of an ideal gas— down a black hole (pp. 102-  105). Would the second law be violated? Clearly, the entropy out- side the black hole would decrease. But the second law could be  satisfied if we supposed that the entropy inside the black hole in- creased by a commensurate or greater amount. This supposition im- plies that it would be convenient to have some way to measure a  black hole’s entropy— a difficult task, since no direct measurements  are possible. Because Hawking believed that nothing could emerge from a  black hole, he had earlier proposed that the event horizon of a black  hole could only increase, never decrease. This formulation is remi- niscent of the second law’s decree that the entropy of a closed sys- tem always tends to increase, never decrease. Hawking recounts his  feeling of annoyance when Jacob Bernstein, a research student at  Princeton, published a paper suggesting that the area of a black  hole’s event horizon could be taken as a measure of its entropy. In a  sense Bernstein’s thesis solved Hawking’s problem, for it provided a  measure of a black hole’s entropy. But in another sense it created  problems for Hawking’s theory. If a black hole has entropy, then it  should also have a temperature (since entropy is defined as a func- tion of temperature). And if it has a temperature, then it must emit  radiation (otherwise, it could remain at the same temperature for- ever, in violation of the second law). But if it emits radiation, then it  can’t be black, can it? The solution to the dilemma, Hawking explains, was to suppose  that “the particles do not come from within the black hole, but from </page> <page sequence="19"> From Epilogue to Prologue 109 the ‘empty’ space just outside the black hole’s event horizon!” (p.  105). He reasoned that if the space around a black hole were really  empty, the gravitational and electromagnetic fields would have to be  exactly zero. But in this case their values could be known simul- taneously and exactly, a result prohibited by the uncertainty princi- ple.7 Hence there have to be fluctuations within these fields, which  can be thought of as the creation of virtual particle pairs. Unlike real  particles, virtual particles cannot exist independent of each other.  When they take the form of matter, they come into existence as a  particle and antiparticle and immediately annihilate each other. If  these particle pairs came into existence at the boundary of a black  hole, however, one of them could fall into the hole. Then the other  could go free and become a real particle. In order for a black hole to be an effective particle catcher, it  would have to be very small, for the particle pair is separated by  only a very short distance. Hawking calculated that a small black  hole with a mass of a thousand million tons (equivalent to a large  mountain) would have an event horizon diameter of a millionth of a  millionth of an inch, about the size of an atom’s nucleus (p. 108).  Black holes of this diameter are not formed by collapsing stars. They  could, however, have been formed at the universe’s creation, when  pressures and temperatures were sufficiently intense to bring about  the required compression. Small black holes differ from large ones in  the higher temperature at which they emit radiation. Because radia- tion energy cannot come into existence from nothing, it must be  balanced by a loss of mass within the black hole.8 As the black hole  shrinks, it emits radiation at a still higher energy, and so shrinks  even faster. Thus small black holes operate according to a dynamic  in which an initially small perturbation drives the system further  from equilibrium, which increases the perturbation, which drives it  yet further. This accelerating feedback loop means that small black  holes could eventually “evaporate.” Although no one knows exactly "The strength and location of the field are conjugate variables, and hence are anal- ogous to the position and momentum of a particle, which are more usually men- tioned in relation to the uncertainty principle. In its more general form, the uncer- tainty principle applies to any appropriate pair of conjugate variables. sBy Einstein’s equation E = m c 2, energy is proportional to mass. The radiation  streaming out from a black hole is balanced by matter conversion within it. </page> <page sequence="20"> i i  o Something out of Nothing what happens when a singularity in spacetime pops back out (as the  balloon pops back into place when the pencil is removed), the most  likely scenario calls for a final burst of radiation as the black hole  disappears completely. If primordial black holes do exist,9 Hawking  points out, they would “hardly deserve the epithet black: they really  are white hot and are emitting energy at the rate of about ten thou- sand megawatts” (p. 108). With this preamble, we are now ready to understand how Pri- gogine and his co-authors appropriated Hawking’s ideas while  changing their drift. They propose a cosmological model in which  primordial black holes are created not through the big bang but  through the fluctuations in the quantum vacuum which Hawking  argued had to be present to keep the uncertainty principle from be- ing violated. Because these black holes have masses even smaller  than the ones Hawking imagined (by a factor of ten), Gunzig, Geh-  eniau, and Prigogine call them a “dilute black hole gas” (1987:  623). These extra-small black holes would operate through the same  unstable dynamic that Hawking proposed, whereby the black hole  generates more radiation and brings more particles into being the  smaller it becomes. Hence the dumpiness of matter, which is formed  as particles coalesce around the black hole gas. A neat feature of the  model is the explanation it provides for why the universe’s initial  inflationary rate changed. The phase transformation falls out of the  equations as a result of the evaporation of the black hole gas! More- over, the time required for the evaporation matches the time neces- sary for the universe to expand at an increased rate if it is to be  homogeneous. Thus the model explains two features of the present  universe which big-bang cosmologies cannot— its isotropy and the  uneven distribution of matter within it. An important difference between this model and Hawking’s is  that large entropy production is built into the universe from its be- ginning. As the black holes evaporate, their entropy becomes, in ef- 9To date, the existence of such primordial black holes has not been confirmed,  despite attempts to locate them. Search strategies have focused on detecting them  through the X rays and gamma rays they would emit. Gamma rays do not penetrate  the earth’s atmosphere; hence a detector must be positioned in space. Moreover,  there are other sources of gamma rays around, so it would be necessary to establish  that the detected gamma rays came from a single source. These difficulties are per- haps sufficient to explain why none has been observed. </page> <page sequence="21"> From Epilogue to Prologue h i feet, the entropy of the universe. Another distinctive feature of the  model is the prediction that as the universe continues to expand, it  will eventually reach the point where it is sufficiently attenuated so  that the quantum vacuum will again bring more black hole gas into  existence, which will in turn generate more matter. Thus, although  the universe will continue to expand, it will never reach a point of  ultimate dissipation because it possesses the capacity to renew itself.  Clearly this model would appeal to Prigogine, for it inscribes the  order-out-of-chaos scenario into the creation of the universe. What  greater validation of the paradigm than to have it explain why there  is something rather than nothing? Not coincidentally, it also weaves  the second law into the very fabric of the universe, making it coeval  with the universe’s formation rather than an artifact added later.  Thus Prigogine is able to find in cosmology the answer that eluded  him in Order out o f  Chaos. Such deeply felt considerations as I presume lie behind Prigogine’s  foray into cosmology do not, obviously, prove the model’s validity.  But neither do they disprove it. One could argue that significant  scholarship in any field is compounded with personal emotion, for  why would someone devote to it the countless hours that stretch  across months, years, decades, unless it mattered on more than a  strictly intellectual level? The fact that Prigogine’s work evidently  emerges from a vision of the way the universe could or should be,  rather than the vision emerging from the work, is reflected in the  apparent imbalance between the practical consequences of his theo- ries and the dramatic claims he makes for them. Peter V. Coveney,  in a recent review of Prigogine’s work which was largely sympa- thetic (1988), acknowledges the problem. A criticism that has not infrequently been aimed at the work of the  Brussels School . . .  is that, even if it is granted from a philosophical  standpoint that irreversibility should be included in the fundamental  level of description, there do not appear to be any new and experi- mentally verifiable consequences to have emerged from the approach. If this were the, case, the proclaimed “revolution” in scientific  throught arising from the advent of an adequate role for irreversibility  and time . . . would hardly be valid. Coveney, who lists the Université Libre de Bruxelles as one of his  affiliations, concludes that he believes the criticism has some merit, </page> <page sequence="22"> i i z  Something out of Nothing but hopes “it will be rectified by consideration of problems of con- crete physical interest” (p. 414). The question of what weight should be given to Prigogine’s vision,  as distinct from “problems of concrete physical interest,” goes to the  heart of why his reputation within the scientific community is so  uneven. For scientists concerned with the practical problems that  make up 90  percent— or 99  percent— of scientific research, Pri- gogine’s work appears to be so much useless metaphysical specula- tion. From this perspective, his reputation appears to be grossly in- flated. But there have been times when vision was central, as in  Einstein’s quarrel with quantum mechanics, which he pursued in the  face of strong evidence against his position because he felt sure that  God did not play dice with the universe. Another case in point is  Bacon’s Novum  Organum . In spite of being wrong in nearly all of  its specific predictions, this text has endured because it had a vision  of what science could be. The examples illustrate that at pivotal mo- ments, vision can become the essence of what is at stake, and practi- cal problems can be secondary or even irrelevant. Disputes about vision do not tend to occur when science is in the  “normal” phase that Thomas Kuhn ( 1970) has identified with the  presence of a satisfactory intact paradigm. When such disputes do  break out, they often indicate that the prevailing paradigm is under  pressure. If the pressure mounts to a crisis, presuppositions can  come into view which were invisible during the normal phase. Order  out o f  Chaos is an attempt to articulate and refute some of the pre- suppositions of classical physics. If the mere existence of this book  suggests that a paradigm shift is in progress, its mixed reception  indicates how far such a shift has yet to go. From talking with scien- tists who work with complex dynamical systems, I know that many  of them regard Prigogine’s claims as overstated. Their main interest  is in what the new techniques will allow them to do with problems  of interest to them. Their involvement with practical problems may  partially conceal a paradigm shift from them, for it is often the case  that new techniques evolve first, and then attitudes change later as  their deeper implications are recognized. I therefore do not rule out  the possibility that Prigogine and Stengers’s argument may turn out  to be correct in its general thrust, even if it is wrong or misleading in  its specifics. </page> <page sequence="23"> From Epilogue to Prologue 113 The concatenation between a proposed solution to an intellectual  problem and a strongly felt personal significance is also evident in  Hawking’s book. He makes clear that for him, the prospect that the  known laws of physics break down at the big-bang singularity is  deeply distressing, for he believes that the universe should be know-  able by human beings. When he discusses the possibility that the  universe is just a “lucky chance,” he labels it “the counsel of despair,  a negation of all our hopes of understanding the underlying order of  the universe” (1988: 133). Later, to introduce the mathematical  transformation that he asserts can remove the big-bang singularity,  he points out that the “idea that space and time may form a closed  surface without boundary also has profound implications for the  role of God in the affairs of the universe. . . .  So long as the universe  had a beginning, we could suppose it had a creator. But if the uni- verse is really completely self-contained, having no boundary or  edge, it would have neither beginning nor end: it would simply be.  What place, then, for a creator?” (pp. 140—141). Such remarks lead  one to believe that Hawking’s dissatisfaction with big-bang cos- mologies is commingled with questions about God, and that the  range of possible solutions is constrained by the kind of God he can  accept— namely, a God who agrees in advance to make the universe  understandable at every point by human beings.10 In this respect Hawking is no different from Prigogine or Einstein.  Each is motivated by a vision that underlies and guides his scientific  research. How to judge between competing visions? It is often said  that the art of scientific inquiry lies in asking questions that can be  answered. The general theory of relativity, for example, enabled re- searchers to ask whether light would be bent by the gravitational  field of the sun. When the answer turned out to be yes, it was an  important confirmation of the theory’s validity. What this formulation obscures, however, is that the visions that  guide theory and research involve issues that are larger than answer-  able questions can address. Light may be bent by gravitation, but  this finding does not answer the question whether irreversibility is  intrinsic to reality. Self-organizing processes may take place, but this  finding does not answer the question whether chance is to be cele- 1()I am indebted to Clair James of the University of Iowa for suggesting this idea. </page> <page sequence="24"> i i 4  Something out of Nothing brated. A mathematical transformation that removes the big-bang  singularity may exist, but this finding does not answer the question  whether the universe is ultimately knowable by human beings. Ex- perimental results can help to shape, refine, and substantiate a vi- sion, but they are not usually sufficient to determine it. Where does the vision come from? No doubt the circumstances of  an individual life play an important role. But visions take hold and  spread because they speak to something in the cultural moment.  They signify more than the research can demonstrate; and it is this  excess signification that produces and is produced by the cultural  matrix. Prigogine’s vision is of a universe rich in productive disor- der, from which self-organizing structures spontaneously arise and  stabilize themselves. His vision imagines the cosmos providing, as  Alan Guth says, “the ultimate free lunch”— a gourmandizing delight  where the pot is never empty, and where the flow of time leads to  increasing complexity rather than decay.11 The vision sees nothing- ness and somethingness joined in a complex dance, in which vac- uums are never truly empty and gaps are never merely ruptures. To some extent Henry Adams felt the power of this vision, al- though when he wrote it was only a glimmer of a possibility, and his  circumstances led him to cast it in a darker mold than does Pri-  gogine. Stanislaw Lem also shares parts of the vision. More contem- porary than Adams and more literary than Prigogine, Lem connects  the image of the creative void with poststructuralist theory. If these  convergences suggest that the vision is more widely shared than Pri- gogine’s critics acknowledge, they also demonstrate that the values  associated with it are more diverse and polysemous than Prigogine  recognizes. 1'Guth’s remark is quoted in Hawking, 1988:129. </page> </plain_text>
