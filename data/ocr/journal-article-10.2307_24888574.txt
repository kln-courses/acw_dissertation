<plain_text><page sequence="1">WILLIAM deBUYS* Navigating the River of Our Future: The Rio Poco-Grande ALL ELEMENTS of the southwestern landscape—deserts, prairies, woodlands, and forests—are much changed from their aboriginal condition, and they continue to change. Unfortunately, society's ability to recognize and adjust to these alterations invariably lags the changes themselves. We are slow to define the dimensions of change, slower to agree that it demands adaptation, and slowest of all in implementing needed adjustments, which are nearly always complex and difficult, requiring new political consensus and institutional change. This exceedingly human pattern is nowhere more evident than in the relationship of the society of central New Mexico to the vital oasis that makes that society possible: the long, slender oasis of the Rio Grande. The fate of that reach of the river, known locally if illogically as the Middle Rio Grande,1 now hangs in the balance as New Mexicans consider the difficulty of keeping the river and its riparian corridor viable as a substantially native, although compromised, ecosystem. The alternative is to surrender the river and its forested corridor—the Rio Grande bosque—to utilitarian management and to treat it essentially as a ditch for delivering water or carrying it away, as convenience dictates. The fate of southwestern rivers, like that of other classes of landscape including forests and rangelands, is shaped by society's response to the most fundamental problem affecting its relationship to the environment. This is the competition between the survival needs of complex ecosystems, on the one hand, and the task of providing natural resources for human use and essential services such as flood protection and waste disposal, on the other. We are linked in this task to our forebears. Previous generations worked with great resolution and energy to develop the resources of New Mexico and the Southwest. Our generation now faces the obligation to deal with the consequences of that development. We find ourselves in a place in history that is well endowed with irony. Since 1492, much of the environmental history of North America has featured, literally and figuratively, the breaking of new ground. But as we encounter limits of supply (as with western water) and the adverse consequences of past uses and manipulations (as with the effects of dams), the history of the future must increasingly involve contending with the * William deBuys is a historian and conservationist based in Santa Fe.

For the sake of prosperity, if not survival, we and our neighbors throughout the world have entered an age of obligatory adjustment and repair. This obligation, which is manifest in such issues as global warming and the conservation of biodiversity, constitutes one of the fundamental tasks of our time. It's not what our fathers and mothers, grandfathers and grandmothers undertook, but it is a major element of our mission and history will judge us on how well we accomplish it. THE THEMES of alteration, competition, and both the difficulty and necessity of repair dominate the history of the Middle Rio Grande. If we were to look at a map of the alluvial plain of the river as it existed a century ago and if each vegetation type within that corridor—farm field, cottonwood forest, marsh, oxbow lake, flood scour, etc.—were differently colored, the result would be an intricate and vivid mosaic, a close twining of many different habitats, often sprawling several miles wide across the valley floor. Moreover, this image of diversity would be dynamic not just in space, as captured by the map, but also in time. In 1900 the riparian corridor was an environment in rapid motion. Year by year and season by season, the mosaic changed as the river flooded, abandoned old channels, adopted new ones, and repeatedly altered ecological conditions in one location after another. From a human point of view, such a system was messy, chaotic, and frequently dangerous. It was also very inefficient in terms of providing steady, predictable, capturable outputs. If we were next to look at a similar map for current conditions, we would see a much simpler image. Nearly all of the riparian habitats are now restricted to a narrow corridor between levees, while agriculture and, in many areas, urban and suburban development dominate everywhere else. Significantly, the contemporary situation is simpler in time as well as space. The relatively frequent shift from one vegetation type to another that typified conditions a hundred years ago has now become rare. With the hydrograph (or flow regime) of the river tightly managed and its available floodway constrained by levees, the dynamism of the overall system has slowed to a comparative halt. To understand the transformation of the river over the past century, we need to understand the kinds of challenges faced by earlier generations of New Mexicans. By the 1870s more than 120,000 acres were under cultivation along the Middle Rio Grande, but that number soon began to decline because of upstream developments. Overgrazing, cut-and-run logging, extensive fires, the extension of roads and trails (which contributed mightily to arroyo formation), and other factors vastly aggravated erosion throughout the watershed. The net effect was to increase greatly the river's sediment load.</page><page sequence="3">Spring 2001] THE RIO POCO-GRANDE 267 Meanwhile, from the late 1870s onward, Mormon settlers brought much of the San Luis Valley of Colorado under cultivation by opening new irrigation diversions on the uppermost reaches of the Rio Grande and its tributaries. These diversions had the effect of reducing downstream flows, so that not only was the river forced to carry more sediment, but it also had less water with which to flush the sediment through the system. Settlement of the San Luis Valley prompted severe water shortages hundreds of miles downstream, and in the late 1880s the Republic of Mexico complained bitterly about the loss of flows at El Paso del Norte—the area of today's Ciudad Juarez and El Paso. Agriculture there had declined by at least 50 percent, and many families were forced to abandon the area altogether.2 THE PEOPLE along the Middle Rio Grande suffered from these changes in another way. The over-burdened and under-watered river was aggrading—the level of its channel bed was slowly rising due to the deposition of sediment and the inability of the weakened river to flush the sediment downstream. This loss of channel capacity made the river more likely to flood and it also raised local water tables, waterlogging adjacent fields and increasing their vulnerability to salinization. Because of these changes, agriculture steadily declined along the Middle Rio Grande from the previously mentioned high of 120,000 acres to only 40,000 acres in the 1920s.3 American society and its political institutions responded. The problems of the Rio Grande, mirrored in watersheds throughout the West, helped spur development and acceptance of a new conservation ethic, which historian Sam P. Hays has aptly called the "Gospel of Efficiency."4 Conservationists like Gifford Pinchot, Elwood Mead, and W.J. McGee, working with Theodore Roosevelt and others, addressed themselves to the problem of harnessing and harvesting natural resources, especially rivers for irrigation and forests for timber, in order to meet the long-term demands of a growing population and its increasingly industrial economy. Pursuit of this task resulted in the creation of new institutions organized to manage key lands and waters. The idea was to protect resources from both hasty and wasteful exploitation by profiteers and from piecemeal, uncoordinated development by interests too small or too inexpert to optimize their usefulness. But the apostles of efficiency did not stop there. They sought not just to cure society of wastefulness but to purge nature of it as well, and by improving nature, to provide at the highest level more of everything society wanted, water and pasture for agriculture, timber for industry, and ultimately recreational opportunities for an increasingly urban population. The apostles of efficiency viewed nature as a large machine, like a factory. The same scientific principles that rendered the factory floor more productive would also make the machine of nature more efficient. The first</page><page sequence="4">268 NATURAL RESOURCES JOURNAL [Vol. 41 thing to do was to eliminate waste and superfluous movement, which one accomplished by removing unneeded parts. Among the parts to be removed were floods in rivers, freshwater flows to the sea, fire in forests, bark beetles and budworms, predators, prairie dogs and other varmints, even porcupines. Granted that a lot of other cultural imperatives entwined with the impulse to simplify natural systems, but the impulse remained the common thread. Today we are dealing with the results of such simplifications in virtually every ecosystem we attempt to manage. Our famous success in reducing forest fires, for instance, has led to a dangerous build-up of fuels throughout the West, and we now find ourselves compelled to spend billions to combat it. Having with equal success removed floods and abundant water from the "machinery" of our rivers, we now struggle to keep the Middle Rio Grande and a few similar survivors alive, while other rivers, long dead, we treat as ditches. A word about "life" and "death" where rivers are concerned: some readers may quibble with such anthropomorphic language, yet the concepts have meaning beyond the domain of metaphor. A "live" river may be said to be one whose suite of native biological elements and structuring keystone processes (e.g., the river's natural flow regime) remain substantially or potentially intact. A "dead" river might be said to have lost the potential to resume functioning in a naturalistic manner. We will return to the subject of keystone processes later in this essay. Regardless of how we may value the over-simplification of natural systems today, it is instructive to look at what it took for those transformations to occur. First came recognition that ecological and social conditions had changed. Next came development of a social and political consensus that action was necessary. And finally, it became necessary to form new institutions to execute the necessary action. In the case of rivers, the needed institutions provided flood control, drainage, and irrigation, while other institutions strove, through forest and range management, to minimize the vulnerability of watersheds to fire, flash floods, and erosion. The history of these institutions is fairly well known. In 1902 the Reclamation Service was created, and it grew to be the Bureau of Reclamation. Construction of Elephant Butte Dam in south-central New Mexico had begun in 1903 under private sponsorship but was soon suspended because of Mexican protests. The reclamation service, eager to show what it could do, took over the project and completed the dam in 1916. The Forest Service came into being in 1905 and in the years thereafter asserted management control over much of the upper Rio Grande's forested watershed. Not all of the new institutions were federal. In 1925, New Mexicans created an institution to implement the gospel of efficiency in the valley of the Middle Rio Grande. In chartering the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District (MRGCD or District), the state legislature gave it the power to</page><page sequence="5">Spring 2001] THE RIO POCO-GRANDE 269 condemn acequias and to levy taxes (although the district scrupulously avoids calling them taxes) in order to build and operate new water infrastructure throughout the Middle Rio Grande Valley. The MRGCD replaced the headgates and ditches of some 70 acequias with four major water diversions, feeding an area-wide system of high-line canals, distribution channels, and drainage ditches. It also built simple levees (mostly of piled spoil—earth removed from the excavation of, say, a drainage ditch) to protect land adjacent to the river from flooding. Soon the new system began to achieve the economies of scale and higher efficiency in agriculture that its backers had hoped for. There was, however, a counter current of conflict between the larger interests that profited from the new regime and the older, smaller operations that struggled to meet the higher level of capital investment required by the new system. The smaller interests protested, but they did not prevail. Conflicts also characterized interstate relations along the Rio Grande. Ultimately, disputes among Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas over apportionment of the river's water were settled when a permanent Rio Grande Compact became the law of the river in 1938. Two new dams supported implementation of the agreement: El Vado in 1935 and Caballo in 1938. Then came the river's last great flood. In 1941, flows of 25,000 cubic feet per second inundated towns along the river, including Espanola and Albuquerque.5 The floodwaters broke through the MRGCD's flimsy levees and destroyed much of the infrastructure the District had built. Damage to property in Albuquerque was terrific, not least because the aggradation of the Rio Grande had raised the bed of the river to a level higher than the city's downtown area. The disaster of 1941 aroused congressional concern, but action to correct the situation had to wait until after the conclusion of World War II. In 1948 Congress approved the Middle Rio Grande Project and authorized the Bureau of Reclamation to dredge and channelize the river, to reconstruct levees, and to confine the river from meandering with gabions and jetty jacks and other means of armoring the channel. To accomplish this work, the Bureau entered into an intricate relationship with the MRGCD, a partnership that has continued to evolve, notwithstanding that the two partners frequently disagree about its terms and conditions. Through the post-war years the Bureau and the Army Corps of Engineers, in one of the unhealthiest bureaucratic competitions of all time, sought to outdo each other in building dams and reservoirs throughout the West. The Rio Grande did not escape their attention. Platoro Dam was completed in 1951, Jemez Canyon in 1954, Abiquiu in 1963, Galisteo in 1970, and Cochiti in 1975. Additionally, New Mexico got its share of both pork and water from the Colorado River Compact. The pay-off took the form of the San</page><page sequence="6">270 NATURAL RESOURCES JOURNAL [Vol. 41 Juan-Chama Project, which has authority to divert up to 94,000 acre-feet of the Navajo River into the Rio Grande watershed by means of a tunnel through the Continental Divide. This project required its own dam and reservoir, and Heron Lake came into being in 1971. Much of this mightily expensive new plumbing was built in the name of agriculture, but, interestingly, irrigated fields in the Middle Rio Grande Valley today occupy about 54,000 acres, which is only 14,000 acres more than was irrigated in the 1920s.6 Use of valley lands for settlement, commerce, and industry has of course produced much greater transformations, and unquestionably the biggest economic impact of engineering and flow control has been an enormous creation of wealth in terms of real estate value. WHERE BEFORE the Rio Grande meandered over a floodplain that in some areas was miles wide, today we have a tightly constrained river and a small floodable area between the river levees. The transformed river is far more stable, more reliable, and more efficient than its predecessor in providing the resources and services that society identified as its highest priorities early in the last century. But the transformation has also produced an unwanted decline in ecological diversity and health, a good deal of which is attributable to the fact that the river has not flooded meaningfully in decades. This is a profound change, for river floods represent the single most powerful force in structuring the riverine and riparian environments. The idea of a "structuring force" warrants expansion. Today we are well aware of our obligation to protect endangered species and other key elements of specific ecosystems. In the forests of the Southwest, this obligation may include the Mexican spotted owl or the Jemez Mountain salamander. But providing for the needs of individual species is hardly easy. In recent decades ecologists have learned that attempts to maximize individual variables in a complex, multi-variant system (which every ecosystem is) tend to cause the system to falter or crash. It doesn't seem to matter what the variable is. It might be board feet of lumber or animal-unit months of grazing. It might be deer or codfish. The lesson seems to be that if the system is managed single-mindedly for the production of one output, the overall system tends to decline, often precipitously. On the other hand, it is impossible to attempt to manage every element in an ecosystem, for there are far too many of them. In most cases it is impossible even to identify them all. Contrary, perhaps, to most people's expectations, this healthy realization does not leave us without alternatives. It leads us instead to acknowledge that, instead of trying to manage individual variables, we must focus on trying to further the keystone processes that structure and shape a system. Where rivers are concerned, flooding is a keystone process. Or more accurately, the keystone process is the river's natural hydrograph—its flow regime—embracing the full pattern</page><page sequence="7">Spring 2001] THE RIO POCO-GRANDE 271 of high and low flows as they vary through time. In ponderosa pine forests, low-intensity, frequent fires are among the keystone processes that structure the forest system. Reintroducing this process in the form of prescribed fire is now an accepted, if at times problematic, forest management practice. Rivers like the Middle Rio Grande have an analogous need—for prescribed floods. Some of the best news coming from ecological research these days is that if an ecosystem can be managed to allow its keystone processes to function in a naturalistic pattern and at a naturalistic intensity, then the individual variables within the system, be they commodities or endangered species, will tend to take care of themselves—and to persist at a sustainable level. This realization profoundly contradicts the older, mechanistic model of the gospel of efficiency, and while it deserves continued critical evaluation, it probably offers as durable and valuable an organizing principle for ecosystem management as our scientific culture has yet provided. TO RETURN to the Rio Grande, the river's bosque—the formerly dominant cottonwood gallery forest of the river's riparian corridor—generally requires flooding to reproduce. In the absence of flooding, cottonwoods lose their competitive advantage to other plants including the Russian olive, Siberian elm, salt cedar, and other species. We are accustomed to calling these plants "invaders" as though they were launching some kind of assault. But they are not invading; they are simply making use of the heavily modified habitat that we've created and that welcomes them by meeting their needs for establishment and reproduction. Among these better adapted plants, Russian olive and Siberian elm dominate the bosque understory in the upper reaches of the middle river where the river is degrading, while tamarisk, or salt cedar, dominates the riparian zone in the lower reach of the middle river where the Rio Grande is aggrading.7 Informed visitors to the Rio Grande Nature Center in central Albuquerque will quickly note that the forest ecosystem beside the river is undergoing rapid change. They will see a vigorous understory of young Russian olive trees leaning out over the riverside drain and pushing up through the older cottonwoods that comprise the topmost canopy.8 Nearly all of the tall cottonwoods hail from the class of '41, when the last great flood triggered the last year of extensive cottonwood reestablishment. One looks in vain for young cottonwoods in the understory but finds only Russian olive, tamarisk, and other exotics. It is the Russian olive, not the cottonwood, that is reproducing most successfully, while many of the older cottonwoods are senescent. Visitors who notice what lies on the ground will feel their concerns grow even more acute. In most areas one finds heavy accumulations of dead wood, for there has been no flood to carry the</page><page sequence="8">272 NATURAL RESOURCES JOURNAL [Vol. 41 material off or any standing water to saturate it and speed its decomposition. One need not be a forester or ecologist to sense that the bosque in the vicinity of the Nature Center stands amid a pyre of fuel and is very much in peril. It is ready to ignite from the first Roman candle on the Fourth of July or from a dropped cigarette or lightning strike. Although the Rio Grande bosque and its kindred cottonwood/willow riparian systems throughout the Southwest are not well adapted to fire, our management practices, which have largely eliminated spring floods, have made them extremely vulnerable to destruction by burning. Unless the management paradigm shifts, the great cottonwoods, and by extension what we think of as the native bosque of the Rio Grande, will continue to decline and eventually perish. Not that a riparian community will cease to exist. There will always be trees and other plants growing along the river, but the riparian community of the future will be quite different from that which evolved in concert with the river. The traditional bosque, dominated by native vegetation, touches many a cultural nerve. As a society, we've come to value things that our forebears, who harnessed the river in service to other values, took for granted. Those formerly abundant things that are now scarce or threatened, and hence dear, include open space, access to the river's edge, opportunities for recreation, solitude, contact with nature, and many living traditions, both Indian and Hispanic. The native cottonwood and willow bosque also possesses an aesthetic dimension that deserves our attention, one that those who consider themselves defenders of the river would do well to bear in mind. Those who would have society change its ways should not expect to succeed by making a case based solely on factual merit. One has to appeal to the heart as well as the head. And so it is important to consider the beauty of the bosque—and the way the native system speaks to one's spirit and emotions. The cottonwood is an icon of the West. Its arching canopy offers shelter and shade in a land where both are scarce. Its furrowed bole stands fast against restless skies. Most importantly, the cottonwood signals water amid dryness. And its fat leaves, the size of a child's hand, applaud the slightest breeze with a sound like rain. In Great River, Paul Horgan described the main road along the Rio Grande as "passing in and out of cottonwood shade, a river grace." That grace, along with the bosque of the Middle Rio Grande, is today a rare and vanishing thing. SOMETHING ELSE that we value today, again because of its increasing scarcity, is biological diversity, and by extension, ecological health and vigor. The river provides ample evidence that the news is not good from this quarter. Lunkers like the shovelnose sturgeon, the grey redhorse, and the freshwater drum were gone from the river by the end of the last century. Soon afterwards, the American eel also disappeared. It</page><page sequence="9">Spring 2001] THE RIO POCO-GRANDE 273 came as a surprise to me to learn that the common eel, which breeds in the Sargasso Sea out past the Caribbean, migrated all the way to the upper Rio Grande. We know this because the Tewa at Santa Clara and San Juan used eel skin in certain of their leggings and ceremonial dress. But eels could not make the trip after the great wall of Elephant Butte Dam blocked their path. Meanwhile, at least four species of cyprinid fishes, the large family that includes carp and sunfish and most freshwater minnows, were extirpated from the Rio Grande between 1949 and the late 60s. Probably many interacting factors contributed to the loss of these species, but chief among them were alteration of the river's hydrograph and reduction of streamflow resulting from irrigation withdrawals and reservoir storage. The diminished flows, combined with the drought of the 1950s, effectively dried up large stretches of the river for longer stretches in time and distance than had been the case before. Construction of levees and channel manipulation also simplified the river laterally, eliminating sloughs and ponds that might have functioned as réfugia during times of low flow. Additionally, construction of dams like Cochiti reduced downstream turbidity and caused a once silty and sandy riverbed to become a gravel-floored channel—an unhappy development for endemic, bottom-feeding fish whose foraging and reproductive behaviors evolved in murky water. Two of the vanished cyprinid species are believed to be extinct. Two others can still be found in portions of the Rio Pecos. All of them had the bad judgment to depend upon scarce water in easily altered habitat, a trait shared by the last of the river's endemic cyprinids, the Rio Grande silvery minnow (Hybognathus amarus), which clings tenuously to life in the river whose name it bears. Once abundant from northern New Mexico to the Gulf of Mexico, the minnow now occupies no more than five percent and probably less than one percent of its original habitat. Unfortunately, it is now making its last stand in the stretch of the Middle Rio Grande most vulnerable to drying—an indication that habitat modifications in wetter stretches, including possibly the presence of exotic predators, may make the river even more inhospitable to the minnow than do the low water levels. The silvery minnow was officially listed as an endangered species in 1994. In the following year, the minnow's terrestrial neighbor, the southwestern willow fly catcher, a drab, jittery empidonax flycatcher that all but the most expert birders find impossible to distinguish, joined the minnow among the unhappy elect of the endangered list. The flycatcher's plight reflects a decline of the riparian environment in exactly the way that the minnow's plight stands for the decline of the river. These considerations compel us to view the future of the Middle Rio Grande and its riparian corridor with grave concern. But the context of the problem is even graver, and its severity cannot be overstated. As bad as the news may be for the hammered ecosystem of the Middle Rio Grande, it describes the best situation existing on any reach of a major river in the</page><page sequence="10">274 NATURAL RESOURCES JOURNAL [Vol. 41 entire Southwest. Ecologically, the native communities of the Middle Rio Grande may be on their last legs, but all other comparable systems are either prostrate or defunct. Estimates of the loss of native riparian habitat in the Southwest range from 85 to 98 percent. There is little doubt but that the bosque of the Middle Rio Grande, among all its kindred ecosystems, is the best remaining example. IF THE PEOPLE of central New Mexico were contrary enough to do what their neighbors in Arizona, California, Texas, and northern Mexico have decidedly not done—that is to say, if New Mexicans elected to maintain the Middle Rio Grande as a live river instead of a dead ditch—what would they do? The top priority for environmental river management would be to guard against losing any more of the native elements of the river system and to manage the system to allow operation of the keystone processes that favor those elements. This means providing adequate base flows to support the system, allowing for periodic floods that mimic the pattern of the natural hydrograph, and affording the river as much lateral freedom as possible so that it can continuously reshape and renew its channel, at least within a narrow zone. These are the goals of rehabilitation, not restoration. We can't get the old river or the old bosque back, but we can try to maintain a new kind of Rio Grande—a Rio Poco-Grande—and a new kind of bosque within more or less present limits of constraint, which are set by the levee system. Although opportunities may exist for moving the levees back in certain locations (notably in the southernmost reaches of the Middle Rio Grande), surrounding development, especially within the Albuquerque metropolitan area, limits these opportunities. In protecting this minimalist riparian zone, river managers would not recreate a "natural" system. Indeed, in a land that has supported heavy human use for many centuries, it would be hard to choose an appropriate model for what that natural system might have been. A more reasonable goal should instead be to create a context in which naturalistic processes can continue to operate. This, I submit, is the kind of nature Americans may best hope to encounter in virtually any of the landscapes they tend—forest, desert, riparian, or grassland. Even so, this is a tall order. Friends of the river would also have to accept that the future of the bosque will include exotic species. Salt cedar may not be native and programs to control it may reduce its dominance in certain areas (as well as free up water for environmental purposes), but the thirsty salt cedar will always be with us. So will Russian olive, Siberian elm, tree of heaven, and others. The same applies to the exotic river fishes that have found homes in the system—they are analogs to the waves of human arrivals that have swelled the population of the Southwest in recent generations.</page><page sequence="11">Spring 2001] THE RIO POCO-GRANDE 275 Those same friends of the river would furthermore need to accept and even create patches of ecological disturbance. A healthy riverine system will be a vigorous and dynamic mosaic of early, middle, and late successional gallery forests, plus ponds and lagoons, wet meadows, sandbars, and scour areas. This kind of continuous renewal is often hard for people to accept. When we see something we like—a stand of towering cottonwoods, for instance—we're inclined to say, "Hold it right there, don't change a thing." But we ignore at our peril the truth that nothing holds still for long, not ourselves, our children, nor the manifestations of the natural world around us. If we really want to keep the things we value most, we have to learn to roll with the system's inherent dynamic of change. This is especially important when we deal with the exceptional dynamism of a riparian system like that of the Middle Rio Grande. The key to management of a renewed Rio Grande will be to manage the plumbing of the river, including all its dams, drains, and diversions, to mimic as closely as possible the natural hydrograph of the river. This means that flows would spike and fall in the seasonal pattern that characterized the river's behavior before it was dammed. The hydrograph is the keystone process we most need to honor. A central element of such an effort would be to arrange as often as possible for over-bank spring floods, still within the levees, to promote regeneration of cottonwoods, to speed decomposition and recycling of nutrients, to carry off or dampen understory fuels, and so forth. It is probably not important for us to enumerate all the things floods do for the system. In fact, we probably cannot catalog them all, anyway. We mainly need to know that the system works much better with them than without them. Having floods, incidentally, requires having a levee system capable of accommodating and withstanding high flows. There is no small irony here that levees are important, not only to protect us from the river, but to protect the river from our diminishment of it. Within the levees, the Rio Poco-Grande can perhaps be permitted to behave like a river. These prescriptions for keeping the river and the bosque alive are presented in an unusual study, which any serious student of the Rio Grande should read. This interagency study, directed by Professor Cliff Crawford of the University of New Mexico, drew on the resources and expertise of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the Army Corps of Engineers. The study was completed in 1993 and is generally known as the Bosque Biological Management Plan.9 Essentially, it identifies the principal management goals that must be achieved if the Middle Rio Grande is to remain a live river with a surviving native bosque. Understanding these goals is a vital first step, but the hardest work still lies ahead. The most daunting obstacle to rehabilitation of the middle river has little to do with its natural ecology. The most daunting problem involves its</page><page sequence="12">276 NATURAL RESOURCES JOURNAL [Vol. 41 political ecology. The fate of this long, thin ribbon of water is controlled by no less than four counties, nine towns and cities, six pueblos, four federal agencies, five state agencies, the Rio Grande Compact Commission, and the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District. The complexity of our contemporary world makes it relatively easy to hobble or stop complicated undertakings. With consensus difficult to achieve and veto power widely shared, it is infinitely harder to resolve complex matters, even when such resolution promises to benefit all affected parties. True conservation management of the Middle Rio Grande would indeed be complex. The challenge is to get all the interested entities, all of the complex political ecology, working in the same direction. In the end, the choice between a landscape embodying complex or simple nature, between a live river or a dead ditch, will come down to choices about use of water. Maintaining remnant Cottonwood and willow bosque via flooding, for example, raises the question of whose water will be used for the flood and where will that water go? Having floods means having a place to put the floodwaters after they run through the system we wish to treat. This may prove to be a significant obstacle to restoring floods to the system. Rivers like the Rio Grande need "prescribed floods" in the same way many forests and grasslands need prescribed fire. In both cases the prescription is to restore a keystone process. One place where prescribed floods have been used effectively and recently is on the main stem of the Colorado. Intentional high volume releases from Glen Canyon Dam in 1996 produced a salutary effect on the ecology of the Grand Canyon.10 Hopefully, the means will be found to continue that kind of practice in the future. But on the Colorado, the managers had the huge capacity of Lake Mead, downstream, to absorb the floodwaters. The Middle Rio Grande lacks that kind of capacity. Under certain circumstances Elephant Butte reservoir may serve to accommodate floodwaters, but sedimentation has greatly reduced its original capacity and interstate and international agreements make its management far from flexible. Moreover, every drop of water in the river is spoken for. In a sense, so extensive is the accounting of water rights on southwestern rivers that every drop in every stream is owned by someone—or more accurately, a succession of someones—even before it falls from the sky as snow or rain. It used to be that floods were considered an act of God. One might say that the "waste" of water was charged to his or her account. But after nearly a century of dam and levee building in the spirit of the gospel of efficiency, only the most extraordinary weather conditions today produce volumes of water that exceed the capacity of the system to control, store, and mete out according to plan. Nowadays most floods must necessarily be acts of man, and to the extent they result in greater seepage or évapotranspiration, the intentionally permitted disappearance of water must theoretically be</page><page sequence="13">Spring 2001] THE RIO POCO-GRANDE 111 debited to someone's account. Exceptions do exist, but they are small and rare. Floods do not occasion the only need for the allocation of water to environmental purposes. Maintaining minimum flows in certain habitats to sustain endangered species can consume much larger amounts of water. In either case, a clear need exists to create what we might call "water entitlements" for individual rivers like the Rio Grande. This is a decidedly post-modern concept, reaching far beyond the ordinary bounds of irony. T o argue that rivers are entitled to a share of the water they carry might seem unnecessary in other times and places but not in the contemporary Southwest, where the laws and practices of the past century and a half are hardly sympathetic to a non-utilitarian view of the waterways that make our oasis civilization possible. Perhaps one day such thinking will seem as strange to our successors as belief in the divine right of kings now seems to us, but in the meantime, those who would endow our rivers with water must find that water within the existing legal and administrative system. One obstacle to doing so is the prevailing myth that western water allocation is a zero-sum game—that all water is fully and precisely allocated, subject to water rights defined with crystal clarity, and that the systems that use this water rim with the precision of a Swiss watch. According to this line of thinking, any reordering of such a system will blow this hard-earned precision to smithereens. The reality, however, is quite different. Look closely at any cluster of water rights and uses and one quickly learns that uncertainty abounds. Who owns exactly what? Who has used how much water, and for how long? Precise answers to such questions turn out to be surprisingly hard to come by. On the Middle Rio Grande, for instance, the water rights of the MRGCD have never been definitively quantified—notwithstanding that the District is now nearing 80 years of age. Besides the existence of many conflicting and competing paper claims to water, a lot of water is used inefficiently. Every system leaks. Most systems operate as much on assumptions as hard data, and only rarely are those assumptions entirely correct. This is not a Swiss watch. It is more like a sundial on a partly cloudy day." Precisely because there is flex in the system, opportunities exist to secure water for the Middle Rio Grande without injury to current holders of water rights. Public agencies, like the Bureau of Reclamation, already lease water on the open market from willing sellers like the city of Albuquerque. At some time in the future one or more of the pueblos along the Rio Grande may choose to disentangle its water rights from those held by the MRGCD and similarly lease water for environmental purposes. Donations might also be made. A municipality like Albuquerque might voluntarily contribute water to a river entitlement as a means of</page><page sequence="14">278 NATURAL RESOURCES JOURNAL [Vol. 41 inspiring greater water conservation among its citizens. For instance, under a policy of "save a gallon, give a quart," Albuquerque might dedicate a quart of its San Juan-Chama water to environmental purposes for every gallon that its per capita daily use declines. As many citizens are aware, water conservation independent of a framework for the use of saved water merely makes more water available for the next subdivision or shopping center down the road. A conservation program that dedicates at least a portion of saved water to a publicly supported purpose would, in theory, enlist broader support. The assumption behind "save a gallon, give a quart" is that the program would conserve at least 25 percent more water than would otherwise be the case. The biggest opportunities for water conservation, however, lie with agriculture. The long-term trend throughout the West is for agriculture, which uses more than 80 percent of all surface water, to become more efficient, and for the water thereby saved to be reallocated to urban and industrial uses. When such reallocations occur, a portion of the redirected water should be reserved for environmental protection. Urban purchases of water can pay for conservation infrastructure—field leveling, drip systems, canal lining, computerized transmission control, etc.—so that agricultural production and economic activity do not diminish. Similarly, federal or state funds might pay for infrastructure that frees up water for endangered species protection. Or funding might directly pay for fallowing or forbearance during drought years in order to provide water for minimum flows. These mutually beneficial alternatives, while perhaps not profuse, are nonetheless not scarce. The greatest obstacle to progress in maintaining the life of the Middle Rio Grande has been the reluctance of vested interests to contemplate them with an open mind. This, however, may be changing. Spurred by environmental lawsuits on behalf of the silvery minnow, the New Mexico State Engineer and the Interstate Stream Commission embarked in March 2001 on an effort to establish a pool of water for environmental purposes in reservoirs upstream of the Middle Rio Grande. Water would be captured in good runoff years when active flows exceed downstream entitlements and would be released both to satisfy Rio Grande Compact obligations and to meet environmental needs. Even with the best-intentioned, most creative management, however, dangers will remain. Obedient to the law of economics, the managers and constituents of any water entitlement would seek to maximize use and minimize costs of the system and endeavor to buy, donate, or require only as much in the way of rights for ecological use as is considered absolutely needed. How much is that? Unfortunately, such a question can never be fully resolved, for it can only be answered in terms of current knowledge, on which full agreement never exists.12</page><page sequence="15">Spring 2001] THE RIO POCO-GRANDE 279 The literature on a wide range of attempts to manage sustainable harvest of natural resources—acre-feet, board-feet, animal-unit-months of grazing—surfaces three fatal problems that lead virtually all of these attempts to failure. The three themes or characteristics include • first, an inevitable push to maximize economic returns; • second, the use of operational models built on current knowledge, which is never complete; • and third, the lack of full agreement on the scientific "facts of the situation," which effectively throws decision making into the political and economic sphere and further guarantees overuse of the resource. These implacable conditions describe the bleak endgame of water allocation in the American Southwest, and every man, woman, and child who lives within the compass of the Rio Grande is in it. The question facing New Mexicans is this: Will we place ourselves enough ahead of the curve of thirst and urgency to create a buffer and to tithe a portion of the water with which we are blessed to the system that provides it? Such a tithe need not be made purely from a sense of moral obligation. There can and should be self-interest in such an act. Anything set aside, any flex in the system, anything that is not allocated to current consumption and use, becomes a buffer against uncertainty that may ultimately help protect the human community against the effects of the droughts and other surprises that the future inevitably brings. Not least, saving something for the river will help to check the movement toward ever higher and less sustainable levels of dependency. In contemplating their water future, the people of the Middle Rio Grande would do well to keep two ideas always in sight: the first is that the MRGCD, by far the region's greatest consumer of water, is not the problem. The MRGCD is the solution. The MRGCD, together with state and federal agencies, should pursue an aggressive and thorough examination of its operations to determine where and how water might be saved by achieving a higher level of efficiency. Having determined how to save water, the district can then calculate how much the savings will cost and can begin selling the saved water at a reasonable rate, while in the process upgrading its infrastructure to a more efficient, easier-to-manage condition. It can reduce operating costs by selling water for the cost of the capital to save that water. The second idea is this: The silvery minnow, the endangered species that has engendered so much litigation and debate over the use of water in the Middle Rio Grande, is not a curse on the region. It is a blessing. At present, that tiny fish, only a couple of inches long, is the only thing that</page><page sequence="16">280 NATURAL RESOURCES JOURNAL [Vol. 41 prevents the Rio Grande through Albuquerque from becoming like the Rio Grande through El Paso, or the Salt River through Phoenix, or the Santa Cruz River through Tucson. I will wager that nearly every person who reads this article has been to one or more of those cities. And I will wager that none of them made an effort to notice where those rivers were. That is because there's nothing much to notice. They are ditches, nothing more. Unless the paradigm of management changes, the Middle Rio Grande may suffer a similar fate. The silvery minnow may save the region from itself. The species serves to remind all of us—city-dwellers, farmers, tribes, and visitors—that we owe more to the places we inhabit than simply the pursuit of the next increment of profit and convenience. It is worth remembering that all attempts to use or alter the land are attempts to tell a story about how we think the land ought to be. What we find over and over is that the stories we tell are inevitably simpler than the land itself. We cannot escape from geography; we are embedded in it. And the test of our character, as a people embedded in geography, is how well we keep our stories current—how intelligently and effectively we respond when we learn that they are out of date and that they require revision. The question before all of us who depend in one way or another on the Middle Rio Grande is whether we will revise our story about life in this place so as to keep a living river in it. This is the story of many people, working itself out day by day and home by home. This class of problem, which involves choosing between an accommodation of complex nature and the relentless pressure of economic compromise, is the problem of the people of the Middle Rio Grande as much as it is the problem of people anywhere in the world. How those of us who are alive today resolve this problem—or fail to resolve it—will afford future historians many insights about the character of our time and place and about the kind of people we have chosen to become. 1. The Middle Rio Grande lies in the middle of New Mexico, not the middle of the river's nearly 1900-mile length. It is generally defined as the reach from Cochiti Pueblo, where the river exits White Rock Canyon (lower boundary of the traditional Rio Arriba), to the headwaters of Elephant Butte Reservoir. The Middle Rio Grande flows through Albuquerque New Mexico's largest metropolitan area, as well as six Indian pueblos and a number of other significant towns and cities including Bernalillo, Los Lunas, Belen, and Socorro. 2.

By comparison, the highest flow of the Rio Grande through Albuquerque did not top 7,500 cubic feet per second during the 1990s. 6. The MRGCD's 1990 annual report claims 53,736 acres irrigated in that year. 7. Channel degradation in the upper reaches of the Middle Rio Grande commenced with operation of Cochiti Dam. Clear water released from the dam naturally picks up silt until it achieves a sediment load appropriate to its velocity. The point of transition from degradation to aggradation has steadily moved downstream from Cochiti since the dam was commissioned. It is now well below Belen, south of Albuquerque. 8. The riverside drain is the canal closest to the river that collects and carries off agricultural drainwater and seepage. 9. See Crawford et al., supra note 3. 10. Michael P.

The metaphor of the Swiss watch and the sundial, as well as the underlying analysis, is borrowed from John D.

From 1993-2001 Mr. Leshy was Solicitor of the Department of Interior. 12. Indeed, it is reasonable to question the security of all of our assumptions about water availability. Most data indicate that for the last 20 or so years the Southwest has enjoyed one of the wettest pluvial periods in recorded history, and if we are to believe the dendrochronological record, we appear to be inhabiting the wettest period of the last 2,000 years. Prudence might dictate that we prepare for the day when our good climatological luck turns bad, but prudence has never been a salient cultural characteristic of the American Southwest.</page></plain_text>
