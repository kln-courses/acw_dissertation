By Gerald Holton Jefferson Physical Laboratory Harvard University Cambridge, MA 02138 From the Special to the General Discipline The invitation to share some thoughts on sociobiology has turned out to be a temptation too difficult to resist, despite all reservations. While I must base my remarks largely on a reading of the accessible literature -- primarily E. O. Wilson's writings and commentaries on them -- the obvious dangers for anyone who is not an active researcher in biology are decreased on an occasion such as this symposium, where there has been an opportunity to check one's preliminary conclu- sions with a diverse group of scholars in biological fields. I shall be addressing three related questions: What are the aims and claims of contemporary sociobiology? How does the enterprise fit into the history of ideas? And does sociobiology have the earmarks of being indeed the beginning of a mjor synthesis? First, one must make a distinction. There are really two pursuits, both re- ferred to by the same term, sociobiology, (defined as "the systematic study of the biological basis of all social behavior"l) and often indiscriminately merged in all discussions. One of the two pursuits is what I would call the Special (or Restric- ted) Discipline; the other, the General Discipline.2 The former deals with animals below man. In Wilson's book Sociobiology: The New Synthesis, he devotes about 90 percent of the text pages and all but a handful of the approximately 2,500 refer- ences to research papers to the Special Discipline. And there seems to be little doubt that, in the sense of the Special Discipline, sociobiology "works" for large areas of animals exhibiting social behavior, from slime molds and corals to non-human primates. Thus, many specific observable and measurable aspects of be- havior are correlated with genetic factors. To be sure, as in any growing scien- tific field, there are vigorous debates about detailed observations and conclusions, e.g., to what extent the relative investment in the care of offsprings is influ- enced by the degree of genetic relatedness of individuals in the Order Hymenoptera (wasps, ants, and bees) . But the Special Discipline promises to mature soon into a Special Theory that may explain much of the observable social behavior of animals below man. This by itself is no mean promise, not least because of the large num- ber (an estimated 10,000) and staggering biological diversity of social species that exist on this planet. We might then have the ability to use one coherent corpus of variables and one quantitative theory to predict aspects of the social Based on a presentation in the panel discussion "Sociobiology: The Long View" held at San Francisco State University, June 1977, sponsored by the NEXA Program with funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities.

Such an achievement would surely be counted among the major advances of science, even if not a single word of it would apply to the case of man. (One may add that if such a discontinuity in the application to man were discovered in principle, that discovery in turn would constitute a major mystery for science.) While the Special Discipline attracts by far the largest investment of energy of researchers in the field of sociobiology, the major focus of attention from those outside the field is the General Discipline, which extends the promise and the program one crucial step further -- to man. But it is then this inclusion of human sociobiology that has transformed into a challenge what otherwise might have continued to be regarded as a specialty with limited interest. The challenge is signalled immediately in the subtitle of Wilson's book: "The New Synthesis," and in explicit statements such as these: For the present [sociobiology] focuses on animal societies, their population structure, castes, and communication, together with all of the physiology underlying the social adaptations. But the disci- pline is also concerned with the social behavior of early man and the adaptive features of organization in the most primitive contem- porary human societies.4 The extension to modern man is immediately indicated to be only a matter of time: It may not be too much to say that sociology and the other social sciences, as well as the humanities, are the last branches of biology waiting to be included in the Modern Synthesis [neo-Dar- winist evolutionary theory]. One of the functions of sociobiology, then, is to reformulate the foundations of the social sciences in a way that draws these subjects into the Modern Synthesis.5 Wilson does not claim that all this is already happening. Although it may be plausible to expect continuity across neighboring species on the basis of specific findings in disciplines such as physiology, psychology, genetics and demography, the general program is only sketched, and its supporting data for human sociobio- logy are relatively few (largely in the realm of "non-rational" behavior, e.g., incest taboo, infanticide, hypergamy, mental retardation and schizophrenia, and the biochemical basis of some behavioral mutations). But the driving force comes not only from such data; it comes also from an old dream: The dream has been to bring biology -- as a science, not simply as a source of unconnected facts -- into conjunction with psychology, an- thropology, and sociology and to make it part of the foundation of the social sciences. That goal may now be at last feasible, if not ac- tually in sight...It is hoped that knowledge of the subject will assist in identifying the origin and meaning of human values, from which all ethical pronouncements and much of political practice flow.6</page><page sequence="3">-30- From time to time Wilson is careful to ask for patience. He points out near the beginning of his book that "the formulation of a theory of sociobiology con- stitutes, in my opinion, one of the great manageable problems of biology for the next twenty or thirty years"7, and he ends the book with the estimate that it may take as long as one hundred years8. These cautionary words are all too easily lost sight of because of the emphasis given to the basic program of identifying and using the postulate of continuities across species -- for example, that "the indi- vidual organism is only [the genes'] vehicle, part of an elaborate device to pre- serve and spread them with the least possible biochemical perturbation;"9 that "in order to explain ethics and ethical philosophers" one must understand the role of natural selection in evolution, such as the connection between kinship and altru- istic behavior; that "the hypothalamic-limbic complex of a highly social species, such as man, 'knows', or more precisely...has been programmed to perform as if it knows, that its underlying genes will be proliferated maximally only if it orche- strates behavioral responses that bring into play an efficient mixture of personal survival, reproduction, and altruism;"0 or again "In this macroscopic view the humanities and social sciences shrink to specialized branches of biology; history, biography, and fiction are the research protocols of human ethology; and anthro- pology and sociology together constitute the sociobiology of a single primate species. "11 To name only fields to which Wilson himself refers: the General Discipline is to lead to a synthesis, across all social species from colonial bacteria to man, of evolutionary biology, genetics, biochemistry and ethology, and specifically for man, also of anthropology, psychology, sociology, the humanities, and ethics. One is led to expect a mutual accommodation of conceptions such as bonding, sex, division of labor, communication, territoriality, patriotism, warfare, learning, aggression, fear, altruism, and the structure of DNA. Indeed, what has been left out of this projected synthesis makes a very short list -- chiefly the notions of the transcendental and of (undetermined) free will. This will turn out to be of more than passing significance. It may not be inappropriate to inject here a personal opinion. Regardless of the success this program may ultimately have, I find it admirable for four reasons. (i) Science needs more such wide-ranging, intellectually "risky" efforts to bal- ance our usual fare of small additions to the sandheap of individual analytical results. Sociobiology is attempting to become a "theory of principle" (a theory covering a wide domain in which a large variety of verifiable results are obtained deductively from a few secured postulates) rather than a phenomenological theory (the more common type of theory characterized by narrow domain, many ad hoc ex- planations via plausible inductions, with short chains between the observations and the conceptual material). (ii) Even if it fails eventually (as all systems do), the challenge which sociobiology is throwing down before the neighboring disci- plines can have a strong, perhaps transforming effect on some of them -- although not necessarily along the lines envisaged by its proponents. And that is one way in which progress is traditionally made. (iii) Wilson's Sociobiology and related writings by the proponents may be viewed as significant cultural artifacts in their own right, because they represent a world view characterizing this part of the twentieth century -- for example, in their plea for a sophisticated form of flexible, almost stochastic predeterminism and materialism; in their apparently dispassionate concern with a secularized ethic; in their accent on rationality and their under-emphasis on affect and symbolic forms. In short, with all their</page><page sequence="4">-31- limitations they exemplify what is widely considered to be some of the best thinking today. (iv) Last but not least, the discussion of sociobiology among biologists and other scholars can and should present opportunities for the diffi- cult and all-too-often neglected task of exploring the possible impacts scientific work may have on ethics and human values. Notes on Outraged Sensibilities The opportunity for such assessments has only begun to be taken seriously. So far, the scene has been dominated by expressions of outraged sensibility -- more often than not on the part of non-biologists -- triggered but not fully explainable by the type of statements on sociobiology made by its protagonists. These responses themselves are well worth studying as events in the history of science. This is not the place for such a study, but it would be useful to identify at least in a general way some reasons for the sense of discomfort produced in some quarters by the very discussion of sociobiology -- a reaction so strong that it has occasionally verged on becoming a case of "limitation of scientific inquiry." For as the New Scientist put it, "There is no doubt that many people have steered clear of the issue for fear of being labeled either as neo-Nazi or an hysterical radical."12 Opposition to sociobiology is of two forms. One is the understandable con- troversy within the specialty field that must test the claims of new proposals. A more visible opposition, ranging in intensity from polite disapproval to organized disruptions of meetings, focuses chiefly on the General rather than the Special Discipline; usually they do not claim to disprove data or conclusions as in the normal process of theory validation -- no doubt in part because of the early state of sociobiology. At bottom, the more vehement objections seem to have one or more of three separable but not independent bases: (i) It would be wrong to deny that scientists and scholars, like other mortals, can be influenced by their "gut reactions." A good fraction of the reactions I have heard myself show this component. If the program of sociobiology at its most ambitious were to work, it is argued, it threatens "to short-circuit the person in the egg-egg cycle"; once more the progress of science would "objectivize the sub- jective" and "rationalize at the cost of affect and passion." We would then have a "clockwork model of man" as the "triumph of reductionistic scientism," bisecting man's nature. In a replay of 17th-century separation of primary and secondary qualities, we would be "casting away the qualitative, the ambiguous, the complex, and the artistic," in short much of what "makes each person unique with respect to any other person, and that which makes mankind unique with respect to other species." When Time magazine recently published a long and on the whole rather balanced "cover story" on sociobiology, it chose to put on the cover, as a kind of emotional short- hand, a picture of two puppets representing a young man and a young woman, looking helplessly and vacantly past each other as they dangled on their strings with the frozen gesture of an abortive embrace.13 Nor is Wilson insensitive to the dangers. In the final section of his book, he speaks of the purposes to which evolutionary sociobiology might be put in the future:</page><page sequence="5">-32- If the decision is taken to mold cultures to fit the requirements of the ecological steady state, some behaviors can be altered ex- perientially without emotional damage or loss in creativity. Others cannot. Uncertainty in this matter means that Skinner's dream of a culture predesigned for happiness will surely have to wait for the new neurobiology. A genetically accurate and hence completely fair code of ethics must also wait. The second contribution of evolutionary sociobiology will be to monitor the genetic basis of social behavior...If the planned society -- the creation of which seems inevitable in the coming century -- were to deliberately steer its members past those stresses and conflicts that once gave the destructive phenotypes their Darwinian edge, the other phenotypes might dwindle with them. In this, the ultimate genetic sense, social control would rob man of his humanity...14 (ii) Expressions of this sort, by the critics and by Wilson himself, reveal a rather widespread fear of abuse. By themselves, fears do not form a rational basis for deciding where sociobiology will be heading, not to speak of whether the inquiry should be limited even if it could be. But even if not rational, they can be reasonable extrapolations of ominous present trends. One of mankind's oldest preoccupations is the pursuit of vice and folly; in our time, advances of science and technology have been eagerly incorporated into that project. More evidence piles up day after day -- the insanity of heaping higher the mountain of ever more fiendish weapon systems, the behavior-control "experimetts" of secret police on both sides of the ocean, the callous discharge into the environment of harmful by- products of industrial processes, and so forth. If greed and sadism have managed to benefit from the labors of scientific workers, it is reasonable to fear that other widely diffused human tendencies such as xenophobia, racism and the like could fashion themselves some protective "scientific" cloak. One remembers the abuse of "Social Darwinism" in such fields as economics, immigration policy, and eugenics in Edwardian Britain and elsewhere -- not to conjure up its deadly per- version by the Nazis with the full cooperation of German doctors, scientists, law- yers, and administrators. The sheer instinct of self-preservation may be suffi- cient to account for the fact that people are suspicious as never before about any new scientific theory or technological development that might enlarge the potential for the control of human behavior -- by whom? according to whose values? for whose benefit and at whose risk? with what institutional constraint? The loudest protests I have heard leveled against sociobiology do not claim that any of the feared abuses have already occurred. So far, no specific proposal for basing social policies on current sociobiological knowledge has surfaced. The fears tend to refer only by analogy to what may have happened in related fields. To be sure, it is a new and difficult calculus: some modern victims of the perver- sion of science and technology are all too easily identified; other are not. (How would one prove to have been personally harmed by an escalation in the balance of terror? Or by feeling more and more like those puppets on the strings?) In this circumstance, sentiment can make itself felt -- and over the past few years senti- ment has been shifting as it did in the handling of food additives. The Food and Drug Administration used to label most of them simply as GRAS (generally regarded as safe), but now additives are considered guilty until having been proved inno- cent. Similarly, in many quarters, those aspects of science and technology that</page><page sequence="6">-33- have health- or behavior-affecting potential are no longer GRAS, from recombinant DNA research to nuclear engineering. Limits of scientific inquiry is the new phrase that characterizes the whole movement. The skepticism about near dangers is no longer tranquilized by the promise of more distant rewards -- even by the prom- ise of exposing, in the long run, those earlier biological and social adaptations that once may have been functional but which now are disastrous for mankind.15 It would have been improbable that any form of sociobiology applicable to human beings, coming on the scene in this part of the century, would have been exempt from consequences of the current strain of pessimism. (iii) Yet another "reasonable" and expectable type of adverse response to sociobiology may be identified as territoriality and dichotomization. A number of intellectuals in fields neighboring on sociobiology are concerned about what they perceive to be grand imperialistic designs on their area, and they are not calmed by the casual disclaimer that the success of the program may be a hundred years off. Comments I have heard made by academics under this heading have contained such accusations as: that sociobiology "trivializes" the work of social scientists by "disaggregation", and shifts the "battlefield" to an entirely inappropriate area; that the ontogeny of human behavior must continue to be based first of all in the analysis of childhood experiences; that the whole enterprise is implausible be- cause one cannot imagine the chain of "intermediate causal steps" necessary for understanding how heritability expresses itself operationally in behavior. Wilson himself was not entirely unprepared for the professional resistance. When he announced that such fields as ethology and comparative psychology "are destined to be cannibalized" because the future cannot rest with their "ad hoc terminology, crude models, and curve fitting," he added "I hope not too many scholars in ethology and psychology will be offended by this vision."16 In his more recent writings Wilson has done little to calm colleagues in neighboring ter- ritories. On the contrary, his essay "Biology and the Social Sciences" contains a direct attack on the separation between fields having adjacent levels of organi- zation.l7 Going far beyond the so-called Modern Synthesis of Mendelian genetics and biochemistry, he envisages a "juncture" of neurobiology and sociobiology with social science. He focuses on the creative tension between neighboring fields whose relationship makes them act as "anti-disciplines": By today's standards, a broad scholar can be described as one who is a student of three subjects: his discipline, the lower anti- discipline, and the subject to which his specialty stands as anti- discipline [at the next level of organization]. A well-rounded neurophysiologist, for example, is deeply involved in the micro- structure and behavior of single cells, but he also understands the molecular basis of electrical and chemical transmission, and he hopes to explain enough of neuron systems to help account for the more elementary patterns of animal behavior.18 In the evolution of molecular biology, "progress over a large part of biology was fueled by a competition among the various attitudes and themata derived from bio- logy and chemistry -- the discipline and its anti-discipline."19 Wilson feels that a similar process will eventually occur for sociobiology as the biologist glimpses the "reverse side of the social sciences"; for example, economics will be under-</page><page sequence="7">-34- stood from so general a perspective that the conventional treatment of the subject becomes merely "the description of economic behavior in one mammalian species with a limited range of the biological state variables,"20 rather than the actions of man in the market place. It is not surprising to find assertions of territorial claims in the replies to Wilson by members of other disciplines. But neither these assertions nor suspi- cions about the validity of the new methodology with its high ambition reveal the passions involved. Between sociobiologists and their opponents there is also evi- dence of a clash of fundamentally differing world views -- a kind of "n-culture" problem. Most intellectuals find it difficult to hold and juxtapose in their minds two still-developing systems with overlapping jurisdictions, the more so if the systems are based on incommensurate assumptions. This difficulty produces the cultural equivalent of a cognitive clash between sociobiology and the other ap- proaches to understanding human behavior (as in humanistic psychology, where am- biguity, complexity, and confusion are handled quite differently). In this clash, the solution is all too often found in dichotomization, in the tendency to exclude all but one system instead of attempting to hold two or more systems in parallel. Some Precursors Just as the opponents of sociobiology can cite plausible motivations for their pessimism, the proponents have their own case for optimism. To deepen our under- standing of the aims and claims, the powers and limits of contemporary sociobio- logy, we must now ask how the enterprise fits into the history of ideas. The whole field of research and the motivating spirit behind sociobiology are not the pro- duct of the last decade or two, as a citation analysis might lead one to believe. On the contrary, it is part of a long evolutionary development. Sociobiology too has its phylogeny, and was already well-established in the middle of the 19th century, at the time when the mechanists and vitalists were doing battle.21 In 1845, a group of young physiologists, among them Helmholtz and Dubois-Reymond, swore an oath to account for all bodily processes in physical-chemical terms. They did not prohibit all metaphysical discussions of that science, but merely declared, in Dubois-Reymond's famous phrase, "ignorabimus," i.e., that we shall never know the great world riddles, except those portions that reveal themselves within me- chanistic science. This group was distinguishable from a parallel but more extreme group of ex- perimental biologists and medical materialists who may be called the "nothing- but" school. To them, all things were to be reduced to a homogeneous mechanistic scheme, including the world riddles despaired of by the others. This naturally led them to attack the established order, the alliance between church and state, and all the other impedimenta to radical progress in science and without. Not sur- prisingly, many of them were socialists and visionary fighters for social justice.22 From the present perspective, the medical materialists and the Helmholtz group were far closer to each other than to any of their common enemies; they were, for example, united in being anti-transcendentalists. To me, the most interesting figure among all these was the biologist, Ernst Haeckel.23 A fiery materialist and socialist, he scoffed at all myth-mongers and offered a complete world view based on evolution and monism (unity of mind and</page><page sequence="8">-35- matter) that would solve all puzzles. The turbulent book he wrote in 1899, toward the end of his career but at the height of his fame, was in fact titled simply The Riddle of the Universe [Die Weltrathsel]. It swept over Europe like a crusade against mystification, against what he regarded as "the untruth foisted on the people by their spiritual and economic masters." Science was to triumph over theo- logy by spreading the gospel of evolution infused with a modicum of pan-psychism. Haeckel's chief point was that there was a unity of the inorganic and the organic world, grounded in the laws of conservation of matter and energy (what he called "the law of substance"). It was indeed a replay, complete in many details, of an ancient message. Here it is first in the words of Lucretius, introducing the world view of the earliest Greek atomist: I will essay to discourse to you of the most high system of heaven and the gods, and will open up the first-beginnings of things, out of which nature gives birth to all things and increase and nourish- ment...Nothing is ever gotten out of nothing by divine power. Fear in sooth takes such a hold of all mortals because they see many operations go on in earth and heaven, the causes of which they can in no way understand, believing them therefore to be done by divine power. For these reasons, when we shall have seen that nothing can be produced from nothing, we shall then more correctly ascertain that which we are pursuing, both the elements out of which every- thing can be produced and the manner in which all things are done without the hands of the gods. In Haeckel's own battle against such notions as personal immortality, the con- ventional belief in a creating God, or in the belief in a mind or a purpose behind evolution, he did not have to refer explicitly to Lucretius. Haeckel's sentences had their own grand, teutonic sweep: All the particular advances of physics and chemistry yield in theoretical importance to the discovery of the great law which brings them to one common focus, the law of substance. This fun- damental cosmic law establishes the eternal persistence of matter and force, the unvarying constancy throughout the entire universe. It has become the pole-star that guides our monistic philosophy through the mighty labyrinth to a solution of the world-problem.25 The promise of eternal persistence and of a guiding pole-star was vivid in the sweeping and reassuring chapters in Haeckel's book: "The History of our Species," "The Phylogeny of the Soul," "Consciousness," "Immortality," "The Evolution of the World," "The Unity of Nature," "Our Monistic Ethics," and, finally, "The Solution of the World-Problems." In comparison, Wilson's book is an exercise in understate- ment and scientific objectivity. I doubt that it is able to arouse a small frac- tion of the hopes and fears that Haeckel's book did for about half a century. Another precursor of Wilson is Jacques Loeb, the author of The Mechanistic Conception of Life (1912). Born in 1859, he was a scientist in the old style of philosopher and social innovator, certain that scientific findings might lead</page><page sequence="9">-36- directly to political and social-development consequences. Influenced by Schopen- hauer (as were so many others of his generation), he seems to have turned to bio- logy in order to find evidence against the conception of the freedom of the will. Perhaps his best work was on animal tropism, the involuntary movements imposed by such environmental conditions as light upon organisms; he considered it a model for understanding behavior in terms that avoid the use of the noxious conception of "will." The accomplishment for which he is most famous, artificial partheno- genesis by physical-chemical means, fell in the same category of scientific re- search findings with anti-transcendental and anti-metaphysical implications. From 1911 on, cheered by the proof of the existence of molecules by Jean Perrin and others as the triumph of mechanistic philosophy, he spoke and wrote on "the mechanistic conception of life," and published his book of that title in 1912. In it, as Donald Fleming observed, Loeb reduced life to a physical-chemical phenomenon, free will to an illusion generated by tropistic causes, and religious faith to an absurdity. He proclaimed the total validity of mechanistic principles, and derived from them a system of human ethics based on instincts whose unobstructed expression would rejuvenate world society. In his book, Loeb asked whether man's "inner life" -- the "wishes and hopes, efforts and struggles," should be "amenable to a physical- chemical analysis".26 And he answered yes, even if the proof would have to come from much research that still waited to be done: "For some of these instincts the chemical basis is at least sufficiently indicated to arouse the hope that the anal- ysis, from the mechanistic point of view, is only a question of time".27 In the last pages of this work, just as in Haeckel's and in Wilson's, Loeb has a section entitled "Ethics." Here is a passage: We eat, drink, and reproduce not because mankind has reached an agreement that this is desirable, but because, machine-like, we are compelled to do so. We are active, because we are compelled to be so by processes in our central nervous system...The mother loves and cares for her children, not because metaphysicians had the idea that this was desirable, but because the instinct of taking care of the young is inherited just as distinctly as the morphological characters of the female body...Not only is the mechanistic conception of life compatible with ethics: it seems the only conception of life which can lead to an understanding of the source of ethics.2 In comparison, Wilson's is a soberer, more scientifically grounded effort. Iron- ically, partly for this reason, it will not have the same popularity that these predecessors had. Evaluating the Potential for Synthesis Against this background we can now evaluate the inherent claim of sociobio- logy that it produces the New Synthesis (or any synthesis). What, indeed, is the structure of a synthesis, and how does sociobiology correspond to it? I view synthesis and analysis as methodological themata, synthesis being one component of the thematic pair, the other being analysis.29 The term synthesis of course brings to mind certain methodological practices in the works of philosophers</page><page sequence="10">-37- since Plato. But it is necessary to distinguish between four general meanings of the term: (1) synthesis used in the reconstitutional sense (e.g., where an analy- sis followed by a synthesis re-establishes the original condition); (2) synthesis used in the transformational sense (e.g., where the application of analysis and synthesis advances one to a qualitatively new level, whether in a given specialty field such as biology or in two specialty fields such as biology and sociology; (3) synthesis used in the judgmental sense (as in the Kantian categories and their modern critiques), and (4) synthesis used in the general, cultural sense. To specify the properties of a synthesis in operational terms, we select a body of work that is, beyond challenge, a historic synthesis, and use it both to identify the structure of a working synthesis in science as well as to measure how close sociobiology may be to the model. The Newtonian synthesis (the historic unification of celestial and terrestrial physics) is probably the most distin- guished example; while referring to it to compare the half-dozen major structural elements of any synthesis, we shall keep in mind that we thereby calibrate, so to speak, the top reading on that kind of thermometer. (i) Historic Roots Almost by definition, a synthesis has roots in the history of the fields with- in which it produces coherence. For the Newtonian synthesis, one of these roots reaches back to the grand scheme of Thales of Miletus, the other to Pythagoras of Crotona. The former was essentially positivistic and materialistic, with a certain resemblance to modern empiricism, while the latter was metaphysical and formalistic. It is significant that each of these systems, which came into western culture at about the same time, 2500 years ago, were impelled by the persisting drive to find basic unity underlying the diversity of all experience, but nevertheless were dia- metrically opposite in assumption and appeared mutually exclusive in content. From each of these two schools, a separate chain of distinguished followers emerged over the next centuries. Aristotle stands at a pivotal position in the history of thought in part because he was the first major thinker who was not a follower of only one of the two main trends, but who made a powerful attempt to adapt elements from both of the antithetical systems in a new synthesis. Nothing even faintly analogous was done successfully in natural philosophy until the joining by Kepler and Galileo of neo-Platonic and materialistic conceptions. New- ton's synthesis, then, was the last grand bridging of the materialistic-positivis- tic tradition and the formalistic-metaphysical tradition in natural philosophy. Later attempts were restricted to narrowly delimited fields within the physical sciences. Thus Faraday's central theme, in his research on relations between gra- vity and electricity, was what he called "the long standing persuasion that all the forces of nature are mutually dependent, having one origin, or rather being dif- ferent manifestations of one fundamental power." To this day, this is the Holy Grail of theoretical physicists, who try to find one force to explain the gravita- tional, the electromagnetic, the weak and the strong interactions. Turning to sociobiology, it too has a distinguished phylogeny; it is in fact the current terminal point on a trajectory or proliferation of system builders issuing primarily from the materialistic-mechanistic and anti-metaphysical school of Thales of Miletus and his followers -- Anaximander, Anaximenes, Heraclitus, Leucippus, Democritus, Anaxagoras and Lucretius. The more recent successors</page><page sequence="11">-38- developed from the trajectory of these physiologues, teaching "disenchanted" or "positive" explanations of nature's phenomena, are some aspects of Newton, Vico, Laplace, D'Alembert and Condorcet, Comte, Darwin, Helmholtz, Dubois-Reymond, Herbert Spencer, T.H. Huxley, Haeckel, Loeb, Mach, Julian Huxley, Haldane, the early Lysenko, and Schrodinger (in "What is Life?"). If we look beyond their many differences, they all share fundamental ambitions, approaches, and themata. For example, the matrix of social values and the moral base are taken not as a priori but as susceptible of explanation within a material- istic world view. These natural philosophers tend to opt for continuity instead of uniqueness, for unity rather than discreteness. In modern sociobiology, the old thema of classical physical causality persists, although modified and recast in terms of tendencies and "potentials" -- an even older yet still current thema. Many of the moderns are social innovators, and opt for an essentially optimistic and liberal political stance. Thus looking at this aspect of syntheses in general -- synthesis as the climactic achievement of a long-term trajectory -- the ambition of sociobiology is entirely recognizable. (ii) Inclusion and exclusion of elements The raw materials from which a synthesis must be fashioned are individual, seemingly disparate elements or separate classes of entities. Thus the Newtonian laws govern the motions of objects from atomic to galactic size. Yet, Newton also specifically excluded large sets of elements from his synthesis -- not only "occult qualities" that were no longer desired, but also light and its propagation, chemical reactions, much of fluid mechanics and the theory of elasticity, sensa- tions in the human body, and the properties of the ether. Sociobiology seems to be in danger of not knowing how to exclude explicitly some tempting candidate-elements. One has the impression that the range of beha- viors, traits, and details clamoring for inclusion is enormously large. To be sure, history reminds us that exclusion very frequently is not, and perhaps can- not be, an a priori conscious decision, but can only come at the end of a long series of unsuccessful attempts at inclusion. That is, exclusions are the result of the discovery of "impotency principles." And to find those, one needs time. (iii) A First Principle After Newton, nothing so basic as the intuition of a universal law of gravi- tation furnishing the first principle on which to build a system will perhaps ever be granted to another synthesist. But sociobiology does make several basic, fun- damental postulates -- for example, the central theorem that animals behave so as to optimize their inclusive fitness; that there is some molecular basis of beha- vior (i.e., that the genes "program the potentials"); that for all phenotypes, including behavior, there is selection by interaction of genes and environment; that there is a continuity of mammalian traits in humans. For the theory's even- tual success in the large sense, it would seem necessary to postulate explicitly the smallest number of independent statements, and insofar as possible to exhibit the role of parsimony and necessity among those postulates that do remain. (I am</page><page sequence="12">-39- of course aware that some biologists may well object to this criterion, trained as they are to be more tolerant and respectful of complexity than are physicists.) We also know from the study of earlier scientific advances that the formula- tion of powerful "first principles" often had to wait for the formulation of new concepts (energy, valence, invariance, quantization, complementarity). New terms, new metaphors, a new language parallel new generalizations. They can of course not be identified in advance of the pressure for fruitful hypothesis; nevertheless, one might speculate on the type of additional concepts that a general theory of sociobiology may require. An example would be one conception to handle the simultaneous actions of opposites: potentiation and determination -- something like a flexibly constrain- ing developmental field that contains decision vertices having probabilistic para- meters. Perhaps new terms are also needed for those distinctive and preferably quantifiable human traits (if any) that are not shared with other species (e.g., similar to the distinction between roles in human societies vs. castes in social insects). Terms such as altruism, slavery, and warfare, when applied to non-human species, may turn out to have exhausted their usefulness and might now be recast, to avoid unnecessary limitations or at least the charge of undue anthropomorphic connotation. 30 (iv) Cohesion of a General System Again, since Newton (with the possible exception of General Relativity) no system with such general coherence, no such deductive testable schema based on one or a few principles can be expected to arise again in our time -- least of all in a theory which is still under construction before our very eyes. It will be a long time before we see the equivalent of the deduction (and hence "explanation") of Kepler's empirical laws. Yet there are beginnings in sociobiology, such as efforts to understand the mating system, the size of families and colonies, and diffusion speeds. More such advances, and a good cataloging of them, will be needed to make this synthesis widely persuasive. The current literature shows that this is the growing edge of the whole effort. I recognize that workers in other sciences may be understandably depressed (or overly impressed) by the success under this heading which the 300-year effort of modern physics has had at its culmination, for that is the model which physics willy-nilly puts before the other sciences. The power of the deductive network produced in physics has been illustrated in a delightful article by Victor F. Weisskopf31. He starts by taking the magnitudes of six physical constants known by measurement: the mass of the proton, the mass and electric charge of the elec- tron, the light velocity, Newton's gravitational constant, and the quantum of action of Planck. He adds three or four fundamental laws (e.g., de Broglie's re- lations connecting particle momentum and particle energy with the wavelength and frequency, and the Pauli exclusion principle), and shows that one can then derive a host of different, apparently quite unconnected, facts that happen to be known to us separately by observation: for example, the size and energies of nuclei, the mass and hardness of solids such as rocks, the height of mountains on earth, and the size of our sun and of similar stars. This is indeed fulfilling Newton's pro- gram, triumphantly. However, one must not superimpose the same expectation on the</page><page sequence="13">-40- program of Lucretius and the related one of Wilson. (v) Demystification and Central "Image It is well known that Newton had a profound philosophical impact on his contem- poraries by his demonstration that quite "ordinary" and causal chains were at work in producing complex or frightening effects (tides or comets, respectively), that the world of infinite change was explainable by the persistence of a very few sim- ple laws which any schoolchild could memorize. By extending the reign of familiar terrestrial processes and showing them to operate throughout the knowable world, a single, almost hypnotic image could suggest itself, that of the universe as a majestic clockwork. Its visualizability at one mental "glance" was probably a powerful factor in its popular acceptance. Sociobiology in its current version does hold out a similar promise of "ex- plaining" complex or disturbing effects in the processes of human society, from homosexuality to warfare. Even if there should be only a quite partial delivery on that promise, the effects upon the world view of our society will be enormous. Sociobiology does seem to lack, however, a central image, analogous to the vision of a clockwork conjured up by the Newtonian synthesis. There is not even a complex one such as Darwin's "tangled bank." The voluminous and painstaking work chron- icled in Wilson's book and similar sources may never lend itself to such a feat of fruitful oversimplification. (vi) Prediction Predictive capability, as in deducing correctly the return of a comet from Newton's laws, is usually regarded as the ultimate test of how "scientific" a syn- thesis is -- the "harder" the science, the prouder and the more confident it is. In this respect, sociobiology seems to be in only an early stage of development. However, we may be touching here on the long debate concerning essential differ- ences between the biological and the physical sciences, rather than on a sine qua non of scientific synthesis as such. For at the very least, a far greater degree of complexity is built into biological systems by virtue of the necessary connec- tion of each function with the organism's history on the one hand and with its environment on the other. (vii) Cultural Reach The claim of the Newtonian synthesis as a powerful exemplar of a cultural syn- thesis that changed civilization has been amply documented. (If one were allowed only a single example, an analysis of the role of Newtonian philosophy in Thomas Jefferson's draft of the American Declaration of Independence might suffice.) By this measure, of course, the strategy with respect to sociobiology is, once more, patience. It does appear that both the proponents and the more voci- ferous and politically oriented opponents of sociobiology are united in the expec- tation that the New Synthesis of which Wilson speaks will be one that changes our culture. If it does not, the synthesis will still be one in the "transformational" sense.</page><page sequence="14">-41- ** *** One may conclude that on many, perhaps most, counts sociobiology has a fair chance eventually to bear out its promise, provided that more of the crucial ele- ments are supplied in the on-going research, notably with respect to cohesion and prediction, and thereby advance from the Special Discipline to the General Theory. It can only be guessed how widely the New Synthesis will be welcomed by the ad- jacent disciplines. Nor can we predict whether the ideas of sociobiology will be as severely abused as were, on occasion, Darwin's and Einstein's -- although one positive outcome of the sobering experience of the recent past for all scientists should be their greater watchfulness and, where necessary, activism to expose abuses forcefully as soon as they are actually identifiable. The issue of scientific validity will of course be decided in the laboratories and in field research. If experimental evidence in favor of human sociobiology does turn out to be voluminous, varied, and positive, the fathers of the field will no doubt be installed in the Pantheon. But it is a curious question whether Haeckel and Loeb and the others who will be waiting for them there will in fact approve of this new version of the ancient quest. No doubt they will like to hear evidence that the social behavior of animals can generally be linked, across all species, to the mechanism of natural selection. They will also be pleased that biology, anthropology and many neighboring fields will have been shaken up in a fruitful way. But we can imagine they will at least raise an eyebrow that in our time the offsprings of Lucretius no longer found theological opponents to engage head-on, and addressed themselves instead to the modern equivalent of the ancient seat of moral force, i.e., to the social sciences. In answer, the new arrivals will have to plead that the road to the New Jeru- salem once more proved to be more difficult than had at first appeared, and that it may be quite enough if we end up wiser about the behavior of people and other animals. Even in making a synthesis, there is a large and useful middle ground between complete success and failure. NOTES 1. Edward O.

Wilson adds at the end: "When we have progressed enough to explain ourselves in these mechanistic terms, and the social sciences come to full flower, the result might be hard to accept. It seems appro- priate therefore to close this book as it began, with the foreboding in- sight of Albert Camus: 'A world that can be explained even with bad rea- sons is a familiar world. But, on the other hand, in a universe dives- ted of illusions and lights, man feels an alien, a stranger. His exile is without remedy since he is deprived of the memory of a lost home or the hope of a promised land.' This, unfortunately, is true. But we still have another hundred years." 15. Wilson (op. cit., pp. 24-25) writes: "For example, the tendency to expand at the expense of territorial neighbors might well be in human genes, having been advantageous to our ancestors through evolutionary time, but it would lead to global suicide now. To rear as many healthy children as possible has been the road to security in many cultures and periods of history, but with the world's population brimming over, it is now the way to environmental disaster. To an increasing degree we are forced to make moral decisions that directly influence the future of the human species. Soon we may have to pick and choose among the emotional guides that we have inherited, and determine those that should be followed and those that should be sublimated or redirected so that our behavioral patterns will both conform with biological principles and foster the growth of the human spirit." 16.
