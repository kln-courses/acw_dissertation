An estimated time frame for the style is the late Western Archaic era with suggestions for earlier dating. A major site with stylistically related paintings, Shamans' Gallery, was recently recorded in the western part of Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona. The imagery at this site consists of over 40 abstract, elongated anthropomorphic figures in sev- eral colors elaborated with intricate designs. Animals, circular elements, and linear patterns occur in association. Many episodes of overpainting and renewal are evident, and the site is believed to have been a focus of prehistoric ritual activity. The paintings suggest a complex ideological cultural dimension during the Archaic period in the Grand Canyon and also indicate interaction with hunter-gatherers on the Colorado Plateau to the northeast. A number of rock art styles on the northern Colorado Plateau in the Green and Colorado river drainages have been identified as having origins in the Western Archaic culture, and these styles are readily distinguishable from the Fremont and Anasazi rock art in the same regions (Schaafsma 1971; 1980:61-76; 1986:215- 226). Among these early styles, it is the Barrier Canyon style that is pertinent to this paper. The majority of the paintings in Shamans' Gallery, a major rock art site recently recorded in Grand Canyon National Park, are viewed as being a regional variant of this style. The Barrier Canyon style was originally named for a type site in Horseshoe, or Barrier Canyon, a western tributary of the Green River in central Utah where extremely complex renditions of this style occur (Schaafsma 1971:68). To date, the geographically closest known Barrier Canyon style site to the Grand Canyon region is in the Escalante drainage in south centeral Utah (Figure 1). The style is dominated by anthropomorphs that may vary from a few centimeters in height to more than life-size. These are usually painted in dark red and are arranged in rows across the back walls of rock shelters and under overhangs. The figures are characteristically elongate and abstract in form, aesthetic factors that create an otherworldly aspect. Arms and legs may or may not be present, and some anthro- pomorphs resemble figurines (Hull and White 1980:Figure 47). The figures are frequently decorated with white dots or linear patterns. Skeletal motifs also occur, and some figures have large staring eyes. Large carnivores and snakes frequently accompany -these anthropomorphs, and tiny birds are often painted flying toward them or fluttering around their heads. In general, these Barrier Canyon style an- 213</page><page sequence="2">214 SCHAAFSMA COLORADO 0nQ U !"!ii :iiiiii ' iiii i iiU ii . ... .......... .:::iilijiiiiiiijii0OLi~.ORA O SHAMAN'S GALLERY SA/V 100 50 0 IOOmi ..::iiilii~liiiiiili ::i~llilliililiiiiili :rii~i lliliiiiti....

The estimated age of Barrier Canyon style paintings and their suggested ori- gins in the Western Archaic culture are based upon stylistic evidence, and the superposition of Barrier Canyon style paintings by Fremont imagery (Schaafsma 1980:70-71; 1986:225). The Fremont culture is roughly datable to between A.D. 700 and 1250 in eastern Utah, although earlier beginnings are suggested by radiocarbon dates from Fremont hearths at Cedar Siding Shelter (Martin and others 1983) and Pint Size Shelter (Lindsay and Lund 1976). Barrier Canyon style rock art lacks representations of bows and arrows, which became prevalent after A.D. 350 (Holmer 1980:38) and probably replaced the atlatl and dart by A.D. 500 on the Colorado Plateau. Stylistically the Barrier Canyon style compares favora- bly with the Pecos River style in Texas for which hunter-gatherer origins are well established (Schaafsma 1971:130-135; Shafer 1986). Although any apparent cul- tural similarities among these far-flung areas during the Archaic period could be fortuitous, other possible but tenuous parallels in non-utilitarian objects have been pointed out by Schroedl (1977:262-263). Recent excavations at a Barrier Canyon style site in the Needles District of Canyonlands National Park, in which there was a convincing association between the fill and the rock art, yielded a radiocarbon age of 3340 U 110 years: 1390 B.C. (Gary Brown, personal communication 1988). There exists, as well, datable stylistic evidence that suggests a much greater age for this rock art. Unbaked clay figurines and fragments thereof excavated from Archaic contexts in Cowboy and Walter's caves in Barrier Canyon itself are identical in form and decoration to many figures that occur in Barrier Canyon Style paintings in southeastern Utah. These figurines were taken from Archaic levels that were radiocarbon dated vari- ously at 8875 U 125 years (6925 B.C.) and between 6675 U 75 years (4725 B.C.) and 6390 U 70 years (4440 B.C.) (Hull and White 1980:122-125 and Figure 47). A similar figurine from Sudden Shelter has also been dated between 6670 U 160 years (4720 B.C.) and 6310 U 40 years (4360 B.C.) (Hull and White 1980:122- 123). Four of these five dates fall between 4360 and 4725 B.C. These data suggest that comparable early dates for Barrier Canyon style paintings (i.e. 5th millenium B.C.) and also possible. In September 1987 a major rock art site was recorded in a sandstone shelter in western Grand Canyon National Park (Schaafsma 1988) (for exact site location contact Grand Canyon National Park). Earlier in this century the site was known to local ranchers who left their names with dates nearby, occasionally scrawled over the prehistoric paintings. Recently, however, the site was brought to the attention of the National Park Service by Gordon Smith, a local cowboy, and subsequently, in May 1987, it was included in a Grand Canyon National Park archaeological sur- vey of the vicinity and assigned the designation AZ B:9:201. For ease of refer- ence, I named the site Shamans' Gallery.

The site was recorded with a 3/4-inch broadcast quality color video, black and white photographs, 35-mm color slides, and a map of the shelter and a detailed measured drawing of the entire panel of paintings were made with the aid of a transit. These records and the resulting re- port (Schaafsma 1988) are on file at Grand Canyon National Park. About the same time the site was also recorded by Mary K. Allen of Washington, Utah. She has subsequently presented papers on the site (Allen 1986, 1988), which she refers to as Spirit Shelter. Shamans' Gallery is a southwest-facing rock shelter in the Supai sandstone with paintings in several colors covering an area roughly 2 m by 18 m on the slop-</page><page sequence="5">Shamans' Gallery: A Grand Canyon Rock Art Site 217 ing back wall (Figure 2). The floor of the shelter is bare rock and contains no fill or cultural material. The shelter is situated about 15 m above a wash in a main side canyon drain- age at about 1200 m in elevation. The nearest permanent water is a spring located more than a mile away. Water may have been more immediately available on a seasonal basis from the potholes in the bedrock on the esplanade immediately above the site, where there is an extensive lithic scatter. The canyon environment in this area consists of a mix of Upper and Lower Sonoran plant life. Big sage (Artemisia tridentata), Apache plume (Fallugia paradoxa), cliff rose (Cowania mexicana), Mormon tea (Ephedra trifurca), pricklypear cactus (Opuntia), as well as acacia (Acacia) and agaves (Agave utahensis) are present in the vicinity. DESCRIPTION OF THE PAINTINGS With a few exceptions (most notably, the sheep painted on top of the complex of anthropomorphic figures and a possible late Anasazi design datable to around A.D. 1050-1150), the paintings discussed in this paper are treated as a western variation of the Barrier Canyon style. Mary K. Allen (personal communication), on the basis of six sites (including Shamans' Gallery), treats the Grand Canyon complex as a separate but related style that she calls Grand Canyon Polychrome. Whether we are dealing with two related styles, or regional variations of same style, is not the major issue here. The main point I wish to make is that the Grand Canyon paintings at Shamans' Gallery are close enough in style and subject matter to the Barrier Canyon style paintings in Utah (see discussion) to be considered the work of similar peoples who were roughly contemporary. The rock art in Shamans' Gallery is dominated by over 40 often very elabo- rate, elongated, and highly abstract anthropomorphs, many of which are phallic (Figures 3-10). The tallest figures reach a height of approximately 1.75 m while two of the smallest are between 25 and 30 cm in height. Most anthropomorphs in the central area of the painting approach the upper end of this framework while, in contrast, body widths of many of these taller forms range from only 10 to 16 cm (Figure 5). In addition there are deer, tiny carnivores and birds, and a few other designs. Among the latter are a few abstract elements, snakes, two small sun- bursts, and caterpillar-like forms. Rows of bighorn sheep are superimposed over the anthropomorphs. The description that follows moves from left to right across the 18-m panel. During the field work, spatial control was established by arbitrarily dividing the panel into nine 2-m units (Units I to IX, left to right) (Figure 2). Reference will be made to the unit designations from time to time to clarify where the discussion is located. The left end (Units I and II) contains relatively small and simple anthropomorphs painted in red or white (Figure 3). A coiled white snake, various vertical parallel</page><page sequence="6">218 SCHAAFSMA Figure 3.

Body decoration consists of decorative panels and rib-like elements. Two small spread- winged birds are visible at left, center. Arms of earlier anthropomorphs are seen in the upper right. The latter are superimposed by the tallest figure of the group (see Figure 3).</page><page sequence="9">Shamans' Gallery: A Grand Canyon Rock Art Site 221 lines, white painted finger markings, and large white blotches are also discernible on the very friable rock surface of this area. The next three anthropomorphs (Unit III) are major figures and along with the large gridded form (Units IV and V) are some of the most complex and individualistic beings pictured in Shamans' Gallery (Figures 4-7). The figure at the left in the group of three (Unit III) (Figures 4 and 5) has zigzag sides and the appearance of being hooded, although this is prob- ably not what was intended. Tiny white arms ending in conventionalized triangu- lar-shaped hands with stick-like fingers project from the lower comers of the "hood." Thin red lines run down the arms and end in dots in the center of the hands. This type of "X-ray" motif is repeated on the arms and hands of several other large anthropomorphs. The body of the "hooded" being is divided into vari- ous sections. The center white area is crossed with downward-slanting converging lines that suggest ribs and a skeletal appearance. Strings of tiny white dots run across the blocks of red and orange below. To the right is a large tapering white phallic figure that fits the Western archetype of a ghost. Thin lines radiate from the eyes. This figure is superimposed by a long green snake. To its right is a life-size, armless, faceless, phallic being with thick legs and feet. Long wavy parallel lines run the full length of the figure from the top of the head and shoulders. From be- neath project pairs of arms that indicate that two or three other large figures had previously occupied this same spot. The large gridded form (Figure 6) bridging Units IV and V is painted in white and in two shades of red, and again tiny white strings of bead-like dots are painted in the upper part of the torso (not visible in the greatly reduced drawing repro- duced here). Two small white arms with red center lines reach upward from each corner of the body. The hands are also marked in the middle with a red dot. No head is visible. If originally present, it would have been painted on what is now a deteriorated and broken upper edge of the rock surface. In the area between the life-size figure in Unit III and the gridded form (Units IV-V) (Figure 6, left), there is a variety of extraordinarily elongated anthropo- morphic forms painted in white and outlined in red and decorated with fine red parallel lines. While the smaller red animals seem to be more or less contemporary with the "human" figures, the latter are superimposed by lines of bighorn sheep that move across the panel from left to right through Unit VII. Unit V is the most complex area on the entire panel (Figures 6, right, and 7). Many episodes of painting have produced a surface full of tantalizing, layered im- agery, much of which is partially obscured by superimpositions and deterioration. Beginning with the large gridded figure and extending to Unit VI is a sequence of at least 18 crowded, elongated, highly abstract and diverse anthropomorphs in various shades of red, white, green, and yellow. Body forms vary from being long and straight to others that are segmented and jointed. One of the latter appears to be composed of bundles of fibers. There is also one bulbous figure in this area, and vertical sequences of arcs in dark red that do not seem to relate to anything in particular and are superimposed over older anthropomorphs (Figure 6, lower</page><page sequence="10">222 SCHAAFSMA Figure 6. Drawings of Units IV and V showing a variety of anthropomorphic forms and animals. Bighorn sheep, moving in lines from left to right across the panel, are painted on top of the anthropomorphs. Stippling indicates white paint. Solid areas are dark red; fine hatching, light red; wide hatching, bright green.</page><page sequence="11">Shamans' Gallery: A Grand Canyon Rock Art Site 223 center). Notable examples of renewal and repainting are visible. The outlines of the headless torso (Unit V, center, Figure 6) were retouched in thick red lines, and the heads of the two figures to the right were redone in dark green. Body decora- tion of the long straight beings in white consists of bands or groups of fine parallel red lines. Heads may be missing entirely, suggested by an enlarged blunt end of the body, or may be shown fully defined and round. Hands and arms, if present, are usually tiny. Legs and feet, on the other hand, if present are relatively naturalistic, and prominent phalli may be depicted. Rows of white sheep super- impose these anthropomorphs. In the area of Units VI and VII the character of the paintings changes to some degree (Figures 8 and 9). The tall elongated anthropomorphs are still present and individual in concept, but they become sporadic. New elements appear including linear patterns, two large circle motifs, and a scene involving small human figures with arms outstretched toward others, two of which are reclining. One of the cir- cular designs seems to depict a giant head (Figures 9 and 10). A second, and very different, possible head occurs to the left. It is painted in white and dark greenish- black and has elaborate knob-like projections on top. A confusing element of this second head is the life form that is painted in the "facial" area. Below is a small animal painted in bright green with its tail curved over its back. The tip of its ears and tail, claws, and eye are accented in red and there are spots throughout the body. Beyond Unit VII the rock surface deteriorates and only painted fingerprints or smears are discernible. DISCUSSION In spite of the great diversity in the individual anthropomorphs represented at this site, they share, with the exception of the white geometric figure (Unit III) and the group of small figures with outstretched hands (Unit VI), a stylistic consis- tency. The less distinctive animals exhibit no significant stylistic differences be- tween them, although the white sheep are clearly more recent than the rest of the paintings, including the smaller deer. Whether the sheep were painted by the same group responsible for the anthropomorphs is hard to say, but on the basis of form and their very poor state of preservation, a strong argument can be made that they are the work of hunter-gathers and not the Anasazi. Most of the rock art sites heretofore documented from the north rim of the Grand Canyon, the Arizona Strip, and adjacent parts of Utah and Nevada have been of Anasazi origin (Wauer 1965; Rudy and Stirland 1950:Figure 5; Schroeder 1955:Figure 19b; Steward 1941:Figure 619; Judd 1926:plate 60; Mallery 1893:Fig- ure 86; American Rock Art Research Association field forms, 1987 survey). In this area Anasazi rock art falls into three basic styles: a San Juan-related Basket- maker II style; the Cave Valley style, which probably dates from late Basketmaker times (Schaafsma 1980:121-134); and the Virgin-Kayenta style of the Anasazi who occupied the area during Pueblo II (Schaafsma 1971:113-115, 117-121,</page><page sequence="12">224 SCHAAFSMA Figure 7. Detail of Unit V showing the complexity of the painting and numerous superimpositions. Several bighorn sheep are visible. The upper right-hand portion of gridded anthropomorph with tiny upstretched hands occurs on the left. The round heads on the figures on the right were accentuated with dark green paint in the final stages of painting at the site. 125). Within Grand Canyon National Park itself, similar rock art has been re- corded by Thompson (1970) and Schwartz (1966:295, Figure 5). The latter occurs near a large house site in Nankoweap Canyon, and Schwartz suggests dates be- tween A.D. 1050 and 1175 for these petroglyphs. None of the above bear any re- semblance whatsoever to the rock art in Shamans' Gallery. As mentioned earlier, however, five other Grand Canyon sites that are stylis- tically similar to Shamans' Gallery have been reported (Allen 1988). In addition, during the course of the field work, eroding remnants of a few Barrier Canyon style elements were observed in a shallow overhang across the wash from Shamans' Gallery. Also, a black and white line drawing of a painting from Cottonwood Can- yon west of Kanab (Judd 1926:Figure 32) depicts four anthropomorphs very simi- lar to those discussed here. The drawing shows elongated highly stylized forms and the same crowded placement. The round knob head of the central figure is like many of the heads in Shamans' Gallery. Judd assigned Basketmaker origins to this painting.</page><page sequence="13">Shamans' Gallery: A Grand Canyon Rock Art Site 225 As discussed above, within a broad areal framework, the Shamans' Gallery panel falls within the general definition of the Barrier Canyon style. In both in- stances the dominant subject matter is the repeated motif of highly abstract, elon- gated, anthropomorphic figures with small birds and animals in association. In both regions there is a tendency toward a compositional organization of elements. Compositional arrangments, in which a unified relationship between figures is achieved, needs to be distinguished from mere juxtapositioning where elements are simply placed in close proximity without any particular criteria for spatial or- ganization. In the eastern Utah sites, for example, tiny birds and other elements are painted at the sides of large anthropomorphs, resulting in a more or less sym- metrical composition (Schaafsma 1971:Figure 77; 1980:Plate 4 and Figure 40). Also, anthropomorphs and animals may be arranged as discrete or interacting groups (Schaafsma 1977:Figure 78; 1980:Plate 6 and Figure 45). At Shamans' Gallery a symmetrical group of anthropomorphs appears at the right-hand side of Unit V (Figure 6). This group of three is embraced at the top by a design in green, and two "sunbursts" are painted above on either side. Whether or not all of this painting occurred at the same time is difficult to tell because of the poor condition of the surface, but the final result is a symmetrical and complex composition. Shamans' Gallery anthropomorphs share with those of eastern Utah anten- nae-like headresses, strings of tiny dots on the torso, and complex body decora- tion divided horizontally into different zones. Facial features, if present at all, are limited to the depiction of eyes and arms and hands when shown are dispropor- tionately small. Analogs to the large, seemingly headless figure spanning Units IV and V (Figure 6) are present in eastern Utah sites. "Pronged" figures (Figure 6, Unit V and Schaafsma 1971 :Figure 77) are present in both regions. The distinctive solitary small green carnivore (Unit VII) with its tail curled over its back is rem- iniscent of larger carnivores also depicted singly in eastern Utah paintings (Schaafsma 1980: Figure 42). The paintings in Shamans' Gallery, however, differ from the Barrier Canyon style paintings in eastern Utah in a number of details and in certain stylistic em- phases. The Grand Canyon anthropomorphs, even within this single site, tend to- ward greater diversity than is usually found in the Utah work. They also are more elongated and lack the eastern Utah tendency toward broad-shoulderedness. Very round heads and the crowding of the figures against one another, as evidenced in both Shamans' Gallery and in the paintings near Kanab, Utah, seem to be a characteristic of the western region. Shamans' Gallery and the Kanab paintings lack the flattened heads and the staring "bug-eyed" aspect of many Barrier Canyon figures in Utah. Variations in body forms such as the jointed and bulbous figures are lacking in Utah sites as are the large legs and phalli depicted on figures at Shamans' Gallery. Sunbursts and caterpillar-like forms are subsidiary elements undescribed so far for the Utah paintings. The large "head" in Unit VII is also dis- tinctive. The extensive use of white paint and red body outlines and fine striped</page><page sequence="14">226 SCHAAFSMA 44 a4 4 UNIT VI SITE AZ 89 9201 Figure 8. Drawing of Unit VI. The large figure (left) in white with fine red line detail is the last major anthropomorph (moving left to right), although there are several smaller ones. White mountain sheep continue into Unit VII. The looped design and the group of small anthropomorphs is distinctive (lower center).

Also of interest is a smaller possible head immediately to the left of the giant one and a small green carnivore underneath with red accents.

In conclusion, the rock art in Shamans' Gallery is viewed as being a western variant of the Barrier Canyon style with similar cultural implications and dating. It is also possible that a separate style category is merited (Allen 1986, 1988). Nevertheless, within the larger picture, a close relationship between Shamans' Gallery rock art and the Barrier Canyon style from further up the Colorado River drainage is evident. DATING THE PAINTINGS Specific dates for the rock art in Shamans' Gallery are difficult to suggest, but a reasonable case can be made for Archaic origins. There was a long Archaic occupation in northwestern Arizona (Irwin-Williams 1979: Figure 2). Dart point types on the Arizona Strip indicate that this region, of crucial importance to the current discussion, was occupied during both the Early and Late Archaic periods (Westfall 1987:12). Jones (1986:106; Table 5.2, Figure 5.2) reports a campsite dating between 1365-905 B.C. in western Grand Canyon. Further, the Gatecliff</page><page sequence="17">Shamans' Gallery: A Grand Canyon Rock Art Site 229 complex on the Kaibab Plateau, characterized by contracting stem projectile points, is dated between 2500 and 1000 B.C. (Brown 1988). Chronometric data for these sites were provided by radiocarbon and obsidian hydration dates. Following 1000 B.C. the Gatecliff complex is replaced by what seems to be a Basketmaker II configuration (Gary Brown, personal communication 1988). The presence of more or less typical Basketmaker II rock art nearby on the western edge of the Kaibab Plateau that is totally distinct from the paintings in Shamans' Gallery, reinforces the probability that the Shamans' Gallery paintings precede 1000 B.C. in date. Within the Grand Canyon itself, Euler and Chandler (1978:3) suggest that there was an occupational hiatus between 1000 B.C. and A.D. 500 (note Jones 1986, above) that was preceded by an occupation characterized by Pinto points and split-twig figurines. Raldiocarbon dates for Grand Canyon split-twig figurines generally fall between 2000 and 1000 B.C. (Euler and Olson 1965; Schwartz 1966; Schroedl 1977:263; Euler 1984). The temporal relationships between projectile point types and the split-twig figurines, the clay figurines and the paintings, artifacts of ancient hunter-gatherer ideology on the Colorado Plateau, is a problem that lies beyond the boundaries of this particular study, but one that merits investigation in the future. Although the split-twig figurines have a much wider geographic distribution (Fowler and Mad- sen 1986:174) than does Barrier Canyon style rock art, spatial overlap between the Barrier Canyon style paintings and the split-twig figurines is well established in the Colorado and Green River drainages (Schroedl 1977). As discussed above, however, substantially earlier dates are suggested for the rock paintings by the typological similarities between Barrier Canyon style anthropomorphs and the un- baked clay figurines from Utah Archaic sites (Schaafsma 1986:225; Schroedl 1989:17). MEANING AND FUNCTION Lacking an ongoing cultural tradition to inform us on the meaning, function, and social significance of the rock art of Shamans' Gallery, we are forced to rely on what information is available in the paintings themselves and their context to deal with these questions. In addition, if approached with caution, ethnographic data concerning rock art made by hunter-gatherers elsewhere may offer some gen- eral suggestions about the nature of the subject matter and what purposes a site such as this might have served. The overhang itself shows no evidence that it was ever used as a campsite. Whether lithic scatters and buried rock-lined cooking pits in the vicinity of the ledge are Archaic in origin has yet to be determined, and even if they are, a func- tional relationship between the campsites and the paintings will be difficult to demonstrate. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to expect that some of the campsites in the area were made by the painters and other visitors to the site.</page><page sequence="18">230 SCHAAFSMA Shamans' Gallery appears to have been a major specialized site for ritual or ceremonial use. The size of the painted area, the subject matter, the large number of detailed figures, and the care with which the paintings were made all suggest that the activities that occurred here were of considerable significance. Further, there is an extensive amount of over-painting, revision, and renewal of the im- ages. New anthropomorphs were painted on top of previously existing ones, and existing figures were elaborated or retouched. In some cases new figures appear to have been wedged in between older ones. It is evident that the site was visited re- peatedly with repainting taking place as was deemed necessary or appropriate. That this overpainting is in the same style and often involves the earlier imagery indicates an continuing cultural phenomenon. The later episode in which the sheep were painted over the anthropomorphs suggests a temporal and conceptual, break with the earlier work. An ideological relationship, however, between the sheep and the earlier anthropomorphic figures could be implied by their super- imposition (Wellmann 1979). In hunter-gatherer societies the shamans, or spiritual leaders, were commonly the artists who communicated traditional knowledge through visual means. Much North American rock art is believed to be shamanic in origin (Garvin 1978; Hedges 1970, 1975, 1976; Heizer and Baumhoff 1962; Keyser 1977, 1979; Kirk- land and Newcomb 1967; Schaafsma 1980, 1985; Snow 1976; Vastokas and Vastokas 1973). Although there are ethnographic data to support this statement for recent rock art (Hudson and Lee 1981), a great deal of the evidence for such ori- gins of ancient prehistoric rock art must derive from the imagery itself as opposed to outside criteria (Hedges 1976; Wellmann 1975, 1976). Such pictorial evidence implying shamanic origins may include birds, snakes, skeletal and X-ray motifs, homed and other elaborate headgear, boats, and fertility symbolism, all of which, with the exception of boats, are present in the Shamans' Gallery paintings. Although the specific functions of the site (that is, whether it was dedicated to honoring a place in the sacred landscape, used for initiatory rites, or document shamanic travel and visionary encounters) and the identification or interpretation of individual figures elude us, it seems reasonable to suggest that the shelter was a location where communication with the supernatural could take place and that it served as a ritual or ceremonial focus for a band whose area may have commanded the upper part of this vast side canyon, an area embracing an estimated 3800 hec- tares, or 15 square miles. CONCLUSIONS That hunter-gatherer cultures are rich in their non-material dimensions is not a new observation (Munn 1973). The mythology and other religious concepts of the native peoples of the Great Basin in historic times are examples of such non- material complexity (Hultkrantz 1986; Liljeblad 1986). Prior to the documentation</page><page sequence="19">Shamans' Gallery: A Grand Canyon Rock Art Site 231 of Shamans' Gallery and other similar sites in Grand Canyon, our knowledge of the ceremonial and ideological dimension of the hunter-gatherers of this region was limited to implications from the split-twig figurines. Shamans' Gallery exemplifies the use of rock shelters by hunter-gatherers as sacred sites. From its rock art we can conclude that these people possessed a complex ideology, and that these belief systems were visually expressed in detailed, colorful, dynamic rock paintings filled with visionary beings and shamanic elements. The presence of a major site in the Grand Canyon that is clearly related to the Barrier Canyon style is an important addition to our concept of the Western Archaic in this region, already known from campsites, projectile and other lithic remains, and non-utilitarian objects such as the split-twig figurines. The site under discussion here expands our knowledge of the geographic distribution of this gen- eral rock art style and suggests that hunter-gatherers of the Colorado River drain- ing from northwestern Colorado to northwestern Arizona during at least one phase of their development shared a world view and its associated ideology to a signifi- cant degree. This has important implications for identifying a pattern of regional interaction during the Archaic period on the Colorado Plateau. Acknowledgments. I am especially grateful to Grand Canyon National Park for the financial sup- port for this project. I also wish to thank Curtis Schaafsma, Terry Birk, Thomas McCarthy, and Renee Beymer for their assistance in the field and Beth Overstreet, Dody Fugate, Ann Noble, and Jennifer Stewart-Laing for help with the illustrations and drafting. Thanks also go to Frank and A. J. Bock who made ARARA field records from the Arizona strip available, to Mary K. Allen who shared her infor- mation with me, and the manuscript reviewers who made invaluable, helpful comments on my original draft.
