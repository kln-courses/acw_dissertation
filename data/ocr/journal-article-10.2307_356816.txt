<plain_text><page sequence="1">COLLEGE COMPOSITION AND COMMUNICATION well done, and the nonpoetic examples Nims uses are common enough so that the student may readily see what this meter is in ordinary speech. For example, "I'd like to introduce a friend of mine," "Deposit fifty cents for overtime," "Eleven times eleven comes to what?" In the section on rhyme, Nims argues for the advantages of it: "With it we are back once more in the world of magic and un- reason." People who object to rhyme are the same people who would object to hurdles in a race. Paul Valery said that one of the most mysterious things about rhyme "is the rage it inspires in those who fail to see its function." To give one example of the ingenuity of rhyme, Nims quotes Byron: "There's not a sea that passenger e'er pukes in/ Turns up more dangerous breakers than the Euxine." Euxine was the classical name for the Black Sea. Rhyme also appears in slang, such as, "See you later, alligator," "After awhile, crocodile." Nims gives exam- ples of rhyme in foreign languages, such as Swahili and Gabon Pygmy. The illustrations in the text are most interesting and entertaining. They include cartoons of "B.C." and "Peanuts," Renais- sance paintings, and a reproduction of a work sheet of E. E. Cummings, showing the tremendous care he took "as he com- posed his apparently artless poems." This is the type of text that will appeal to the student who has hated poetry all his life. It simplifies much of the mystery of versification and could be used in a humanities course also. JOHN F. Cox Mohave Community College Kingman, Arizona LITERATURE OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN, ed. Thomas E. Sanders and Walter W. Peek (Glencoe, 1973, 534pp., $10.95). THE MAN TO SEND RAIN CLOUDS: CONTEMPORARY STORIES BY AMERICAN INDIANS, ed. Kenneth Rosen (Viking, 1974, 178pp., $6.95). THE PORTABLE NORTH AMERICAN INDIAN READER, ed. Fredrick W. Tur- ner III (Viking, 1974, 640pp., $3.95). Only a few years ago, accessible textual material for courses in American Indian literature was sparse. Now in the wake of the on-going American Indian cultural renascence, a flood of anthologies of Amer- ican Indian literature has appeared. Two of the most recent and ambitious are Litera- ture of the American Indian and The Port- able American Indian Reader. Literature of the American Indian is a unique collection in many ways. It is sig- nificantly broader in scope than previous anthologies. It is the first of the anthologies written specifically for use in literature classes. The preface and the introductions to each of the eight chapters written by the editors, themselves American Indians, go far in building a context for the material included-a feature lacking in previous an- thologies. Finally, the material is well se- lected, representing some of the finest his- toric and contemporary American Indian literature. Yet for all its strengths, the book is dis- appointing, disappointing perhaps because of the expectations it raises and does not satisfy. An example is the editors' com- mentary, strong and well phrased but often breaking under closer scrutiny. The intro- duction to Chapter One, "Pre-Columbian Religions," argues that the central Native American religious principle, "the Great Mystery" or Wakonda, stands for the mys- terious life power permeating all natural forms and forces and all phases of man's conscious life and that this life power can- not properly be crystalized into the anthro- pomorphic God or "Great Spirit" of Western religions. "Wa'kon-tah lacks image, being all things," write Sanders and Peek; yet in the first selection in that chapter, "The Cheyenne Account of How the World Was Made," we find Maheo (the Great Mys- tery?) waving his arms and pulling out rib bones in the most anthropomorphic fashion. Or again in the "Winnebago Origin Ac- count," given later in the chapter, Earth- maker (the Great Mystery?) sits alone in space with tears flowing from his eyes. In what sense does the Great Mystery lack image if he has arms and ribs and cries? Is this inconsistency due to some native transformation of the Great Mystery into the form of the Christian God? Or is it due to inadequacies of translation? The editors give us no comment. The question of translation is raised at 86</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS some length in the introduction to Chapter Three, "Pre-Columbian Poetry," and the inadequacy of Henry Rowe Schoolcraft's translation of one Ojibwa song is well docu- mented. Further, the editors note that Schoolcraft's work set the pattern for almost all of his successors. Yet throughout the chapter, indeed throughout the book, the editors reproduce word for word those very inadequate translations. Nowhere do they attempt the significant retranslations that need to be done. In the same introduction, the editors generalize that "brevity characterizes most Native American poetry." As the poems ap- pear in the remainder of the chapter, this generalization would seem to be true. But when one looks to the sources from which some of the poems come, it could not be less true. "The Rite of Vigil: the Chant of the Symbolic Colors" (p. 126), for example, is taken from Francis La Flesche's volumi- nous collection of Osage ritual songs and is in fact part of an Osage wi'-gi-e, some fifteen hundred lines long. Mention of the La Flesche excerpt points to another aspect of the anthology which goes beyond disappointment to irritation. A high percentage of the selections in the book are reprinted without mention of the collectors name and, amazingly, without mention of the source from which the selec- tions are taken. Chapter Two, for example, includes six stories taken word for word from J. O. Dorsey's collection of Omaha and Ponca verbal art, The Cegiha Language, yet I find no mention of Dorsey or the source of the stories in that chapter or anywhere in the book. Even the names of the Omaha storytellers from whom Dorsey recorded the stories (Frank La Flesche and George Mil- ler) are omitted. Having given these examples, I'll return to my point. Most literary scholars would now agree that American Indian tribal liter- atures are significant and do deserve study but that we are somewhat in the reverse position of the Indian musician who ap- proached Alice Fletcher's piano for the first time: His attention is engaged by the mechanism. He hears the thud of the hammer, "the drum inside" the piano, the twanging of the metal strings and the abrupt discon- nected tones. Until he is able to ignore these noises he cannot recognize the most familiar tunes. (Indian Story and Song from North America, p. 118) Lest we too become distracted by the mechanism, we need informed commentary on the conventions and patters of American Indian verbal art. Sanders and Peek have begun this necessary task with their rather sweeping and general commentaries, but they have not gone far enough. In one sense, they have not taken the material seriously enough. If their book is to be a textual tool which leads students to understand and appreciate the remarkable subtlety of much American Indian verbal art, their com- mentaries will have to be made more particular. For American Indian literary material will stand and grow under the close scrutiny we presently practice on English and American literature, and from that closer examination, a respect for the integrity of American Indian cultures which goes beyond guilt and fashion will follow. Fredrick W. Turner aims his Portable North American Indian Reader at the "gen- eral American reader," thereby avoiding some of the criticism I have made of the Sanders and Peek anthology. Yet I have to make some of the same criticism of the Turner text as I did of the other text. Turner notes that "Melville Jacobs once stated ... that Indian folklore should not be printed without a full accompanying description of the socio-cultural context within which the materials originally existed." Then he adds that this must surely be advice to specialists and that he just doesn't have room to in- clude such supportive material in his anthol- ogy. Fair enough, but in practice what does Turner do? In reprinting Aileen O'Bryan's excellent version of the Navajo emergence narrative, Turner retains her notes "because of the unusually complicated cosmogony." Rightly so; it is precisely inclusions of this sort which would make his book more useful than the Sanders and Peek volume. But he doesn't do so consistently. Reprinting parts of the Winnebago Trickster cycle collected by Paul Radin, Turner omits not only Radin's notes and commentary, which are some of the most useful yet written on American Indian verbal art, but also parts of the cycle which demonstrate that the 87</page><page sequence="3">COLLEGE COMPOSITION AND COMMUNICATION series of nearly fifty stories indeed consti- tutes a cycle, a unity, rather than a random series of incidents. Lost is the drama of man's developing consciousness; lost, too, is some of the finest satire in American Indian verbal art. A few remarks on one episode will illus- trate the consequences of such omissions. Turner reprints episode fifteen of the cycle (p. 113), in which Trickster (Wakdjunkaga) wakes one morning alone to find something floating high above him in the sky. He cries, "Aha, ahal The chiefs have unfurled their banner! The people must be having a great feast, for this is always the case when the chiefs banner is unfurled." Then as he sits up, Trickster notices that it is not the chief's banner at all but rather his own penis which has become stiff and has carried his blanket high above him. Realizing this, he takes hold of the outsize member and coils it up into a box, which he places on his back as he resumes his wandering. In isolation, the episode seems exceedingly obscene (and exceedingly funny), but little more. However, when we look to Radin's comments and episodes, not included by Turner, we discover that the incident is a social satire of the most savage sort. Radin's note for the episode reads: "At the feasts given by the two chiefs of the tribe, the chief of the Thunderbird clan-he is like- wise the tribal chief-and the chief of the Bear clan, carry their tokens of office, two long crook-shaped staffs, two apiece, with feathers attached to them. In spite of the fact that chiefs are mentioned he [Trickster] is clearly referring to the great peace feast given by the tribal chief-and this makes this whole incident doubly scurrilous and blasphemous." In the context of the whole cycle, the episode is set up by several other similar blasphemous adventures at the very outset of Trickster's adventures. Moreover, when seen in the context of the whole, the episode is part of a thematic movement to- ward greater definition of self on the part of Trickster. At this early stage in the cycle, he does not even know where his penis belongs, much less what it is used for. It may be enough for the "general American reader" to laugh at Trickster's confusion in the dawn, but the inclusion of only a few notes could help him to see Trickster's troubles as much more and to see that the Winnebago raconteur, Sam Blowsnake, was a skilled satirist, in addition to being an obscene storyteller. Though his selections are broad and well chosen, if unevenly annotated, the real con- tribution of Turner's collection is found in the straightforward remarks he makes in his introduction. In his words, he seeks to "render the Indian with the bark on." There is a persistent tendency among collectors and readers of American Indian literary ma- terial to idealize American Indian cultures and to fix American Indians in a timeless golden age before white contact. Turner re- minds us that we need to examine the new stereotypic image we are creating for the Indian. In the winter of 1971, I led a group of university students on a travel class into the Four Corers area. When we attended the Turtle Dance at Taos, the Hopi Katchina dances at Walpi, and a moving poetry read- ing by Simon Ortiz before a piion fire in Albuquerque, we saw only the Indian of our literature texts. Then we drove into Gallup, New Mexico, with its endless rows of pawn shops, bars, and greasy cafes, and our "strategy of avoidance"-to use Turner's phrase-changed from romanticism to guilt. Quickly we escaped to Window Rock, the Navajo capital, where we expected our romanticism to be restored. But it was at Window Rock where that romanticism was exploded once and for all by cubicles of young Navajo bureaucrats, each with pastel shirt and wide tie, secretary and IBM type- writer-exploded by the same young Navajos who during the lunch hour shared cen- turies-old coyote tales and donkey songs with us. Indian people and their literature haven't remained in the "Golden Age"; only our responses to them have. By examining our new "strategies of avoidance" in his introduction, Turner tries to bring our re- sponses out of the stereotypic pattern and into some kind of balance. But in that effort, even he falters at times. He writes of "fragmentary tribal legends all but obliterated by the destruction of the tribal cultures" and of a-few early authors catching "between the covers of books the last whispers of ancient tribal ways." And one of the most persistent "strategies of avoidance" slips in-the Vanishing Amer- ican. Clearly, American Indian people have 88</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS not vanished, and their literatures are any- thing but "last whispers." Throughout the continent, but especially in parts of the Southwest, oral traditions persist and in many cases flourish. Evidence of the persistence of Native American verbal art in more or less tradi- tional forms has begun to appear in print, in some cases-e.g. Navajo History (Navajo Community College Press, 1971) and The Zunis: Self-Portrayals (University of New Mexico Press, 1972)-without the folklorist- as-editor serving as intermediary. Mean- while, other American Indians have begun to write in alien Western genres, using tradi- tional oral materials as well as their contem- porary Indian experiences to shape poems, novels, short stories, and essays. Kenneth Rosen's collection of short stories by con- temporary American Indian writers, The Man to Send Rain Clouds, is an excellent example. In the nineteen stories that Rosen has gathered, the realities of contemporary In- dian life become clear. In the story/poems of Anna Lee Walters and Larry Littlebird, the rivers of traditional pattern and theme run deep but close to the surface. In the stories of Leslie Silko and Simon Ortiz, those same waters flow beneath a very con- temporary sadness, irony, and at times, des- pair. Silko's short story "Bravura" is a sharp and economical literary picture of the very "strategies of avoidance" Turner mentions in the introduction to his anthology. The book will clearly be useful as a text both to those of us who teach Native American literatures and to those who would make their Amer- ican literature classes more representative. LAWRENCE J. EVERS University of Arizona Tucson MODERN DOGMA AND THE RHET- ORIC OF ASSENT, Wayne C. Booth (University of Notre Dame Press, 1974, 235pp., $10.95). A RHETORIC OF IRONY, Wayne C. Booth (University of Chicago Press, 1974, 292pp., $12.50). In many ways, I am just exactly the wrong person to review these books. In the first place, I am committed to the points of view that they advance; second, I am not a philosopher and hence am diffident about evaluating a philosophical argument. With this prudential warning by way of candor, I can go on to say that I found Modern Dogma and A Rhetoric of Irony to be in- telligent, fascinating, and healthy books, though in due course I will point out what I consider to be a flaw in the latter. Underlying both is the premise that there is a positive value in the meeting of minds: It is always good to maintain and improve the quality of our symbolic exchange with our fellow "selves"-to sharpen our sym- bolic powers so that we can understand and be understood, "taking in" other selves and thus expanding our own. (Dogma, pp. 202-3) It is always good, I have assumed, for two minds to meet in symbolic exchange; it is always good for an irony to be grasped when intended, always good for readers and authors to achieve understanding. (Irony, p. 204) Modern Dogma schematizes the situation in which theories hold that minds cannot really meet on questions of value, and the culprit here is positivism, with its conclusion that "there can be no 'should' about chang- ing your mind except when empirical proofs are available or when correct or incorrect logical calculation is in question" (Dogma, p. 12). This "scientism," as Booth calls it, might not make irrationalism inevitable, but it surely gives cause for those counter- dogmatists who "feel free to assert any value that 'feels' right" (Dogma, p. 14). For the behaviorists, of course, "Value" means almost "tropism." This cult of modemism-with its sci- entismic, irrationalistic, and behavioristic sub-sects-effectively denies rhetoric, an art that characteristically deals with questions which are meaningless in the positivist sense. But we hardly need yet another argu- ment in favor of the meaningfulness of values. In my small library at home, I have Morris Raphael Cohen's A Preface to Logic, Abraham Kaplan's The Conduct of Inquiry, and Chaim Perelman and L. Olbrechts- Tyteca's The New Rhetoric, to name only a few books by Mr. Booth's precursors and 89</page></plain_text>
