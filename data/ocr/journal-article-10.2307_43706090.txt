<plain_text><page sequence="1">the spiritual history of Israel, by J. Jocz; Eyre and Spottiswoode, 25s. the bridge iv, edited by John M. Oesterreicher; Pantheon, $4.50. Born in Lithuania of Jewish Christian parents, Dr Jocz is an Anglican who teaches theology in Canada. His theological outlook, uncharacteristic of Anglicanism, owes a good deal to Karl Barth. His style of writing is also out of the best Anglican tradition in being disconcertingly full of irrelevant, rather splenetic outbursts, such as that there is a 'conspicuous lack of mystics' and that there are 'no hermits' in the Bible. Indeed the whole book is most untraditional and most unCatholic. 'The immorality (sic) of the soul', we are assured, 'as a doctrine is of special danger to our modern age in which man asserts his autonomy with demonic ruthlessness'. The title is misleading. Basically the book is about prophetism as the key to understanding the biblical conception of revelation - and the first chapter on the prophets themselves starts by citing 109</page><page sequence="2">LIFE OF THE SPIRIT the definition of prophet in the Concise Oxford Dictionary, 'which is an infallible guide in determining the meaning of a word'. Well, maybe; but it is no place to inaugurate a study of prophetism in the Old Testament. This is, in fact, precisely the error of interpreting the Bible in unbiblical categories which Dr Jocz earlier attacks and now so crudely falls into. His approach is far too semantic, and never comes near to exhibiting, from the Bible itself, either how the role of the prophet emerged and developed in actual historical situations or what distinctive aspect of the divine mystery each of the prophets was privileged to bring out. The book is full of questionable assertions. Is it so sure, for instance, that the anthropomorphism of the creation-story in Genesis 2 is a sign of its primitive character? Many exegetes would take it as a sign of its sophistication. An earlier book by Dr Jocz, on the theology of election, with special reference to the function of Israel, is, as it happens, reviewed - fairly severely - in the new issue of The Bridge, which is the yearbook of Judaeo-Christian studies edited by Mgr Oesterreicher. It is interesting to note that he and Fr Gregory Baum, two of the leading ecumenists in North America and both consultore to the Secretariat for Christian Unity, are also deeply concerned in promoting better relations between Christians and Jews. It is perhaps America's destiny to bring out the role of the Jews in ecumenism. At least it is now being seen that the most original schism of all, that which occurred between the Church and Israel, has its significance in this century of striving to reunite divided Christendom. There is, here, a report of a meeting of Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, held at Basel in 1958, by Fr Herbert Haag of Tübingen who was one of the chief speakers. The others included Fr Paul Démann, Oscar Cullmann, and André Neher. But this number of The Bridge is really dedicated to a series of comple- mentary studies on the love of God in the Christian and Jewish traditions. Perhaps the finest of these - and they are all very interesting - are the essay by Fr Stanislas Lyonnet on St Paul and the one by Dame Mirjam Prager on the parables. There are also essays, related to the central theme, on the Spanish Inquisition and its treatment of the Jews, the veneration of the Torah by the medieval popes, the Jewish marriage rite, Franz Werfel (of The Song of Bernadette ), and Boris Pasternak. Altogether it is a most varied and stimulating collection, calling for a certain initiation on the part of the reader into Judaeo- Christian concerns, but certainly offering such a reader much to deepen his sympathy and quicken his prayer for our brothers in the faith of Abraham.
