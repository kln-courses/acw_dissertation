ABSTRACT The Articulated Total Body (ATB) computer program, sometimes referred to as the Crash Victim Simulator (CVS), is a powerful tool to aid in studying occupant kinematics in motor vehicle collisions. There are many options available within the ATB/CVS model and associated utility programs, such as GEBOD, which allow an analyst to model specific collisions and occupants. This paper discusses ATB/CVS as a tool for use in collision reconstruction. Specific examples are presented in developing a crash pulse from vehicle simulation programs such as EDSMAC, SMAC, HVOSM, etc. Techniques are also presented for modelling other moveable objects within the occupant environment, such as a seat back, steering column, or intrusion into the occupant compartment. A series of programs to aid in setting up an ATB data file, the CAL-3D Users Convenience Package, is also discussed. INTRODUCTION The Articulated Total Body (ATB)[1]* computer program, also known as the Crash Victim Simulator (CVS), is a powerful simulation tool that can be used to study occupant kinematics in motor vehicle collisions. However, the ATB/CVS program is generic in nature; the simulation model can be used to model occupants in motor vehicle collision, occupants being ejected from military aircraft, and vehicle rollover kinematics, to name a few. This generic nature may complicate the setup of the model. There are so many options available, a casual user may not understand the options well enough to make a proper selection. There are also many options that were introduced in earlier versions of the program that have been superseded, such as the seat belt being replaced by the harness belt. However, one of the goals in developing the ATB/CVS model has always been to maintain backward compatibility with previous data files. This then requires that the options which have been superseded be left in the code to ensure that older data files will still produce the same output. * Numbers in brackets designate references found at the end of the paper.

Figure 1 - Outline of ATB input There is a subset of all these options which can be used to model occupants in automobile collisions without the burdensome task of understanding ALL the other options. The basic options used in defining the occupant as well as the vehicle motion will be discussed in this paper.Every ATB simulation, including those used to study occupant kinematics in a motor vehicle collisions, contains nine (9) groups of data, identified by card letters A through I, as shown in Figure 1 . The input file describes the occupant, the motion of the vehicle, and the possible interactions between the occupant and the environment (typically the vehicle interior). 273</page><page sequence="2">OCCUPANT DESCRIPTION One of the tasks in setting up an ATB model is to define the parameters for the occupant The occupant is typically divided into 1 5 or 1 7 body segments, as shown in Figure 2. The contact surface for each segment is modelled by an ellipsoid. The ellipsoid dimensions along with inertial properties are required for every segment. A computer program has been developed to aid a researcher in defining these parameters. The program is called GEBOD (GEnerator ofBOdy Data)[2]. Version GEBODIII, was released in 1 99 1 , with version GEBODIII. 1 as an update in April of 1993. л iiLíK 12 и Jl2 ( z )}*Y14 13 6 I 9 ^6/ ' / ' 9 7 10 V)J|° /угу Figure 2 - ATB occupant segments. The GEBOD program can be used to produce human or anthropomorphic test device (ATD) models for use in the ATB program. There are three different ATD types which can be produced; 1) sitting Hybrid III (50 %tile), 2) standing Hybrid III (50 %tile), and 3) Hybrid II (50 %tile). In addition, GEBOD can read a file with specific body dimensions supplied by the user. The program then uses these dimensions to generate the body segment descriptions. For human modelling, the program prompts the user for certain specific information regarding the human to model, such as gender, height, weight, etc., as shown in Figure 3. GEBOD then uses regression equations to approximate the required properties and produce a file in the format required by ATB. Almost any size occupant can be modelled using GEBOD. Female height ranges from 1 .446 to 1 .830 meters(56.93 to 72.05 inches) and weight ranges from 378. 1 to 889.7 newtons (85 to 200 lbs). There are similar ranges for the adult male occupant model, with the height ranging from 1 .579 to 1 .972 meters (62. 1 7 to 77.64 inches) and the weight ranging from 524.9 to 1 174.0 newtons (118 to 264 lbs). A child model is also available which permits input of age from 2 to 20 years old, with no distinction for gender.

Each data set produced by GEBOD must be checked for reasonable output data. The program uses a set of regression formulas, and sometimes occupant data is produced that is unreasonable . For example, Figure 4 shows two data sets produced for a small female; the moments of inertia for the center- torso (CT) are negative. Apparently, the regression formulas produce a curve fit which drops below zero for this property in this 274</page><page sequence="3">small range of values. This problem has been corrected in version GEBODIV, which should be distributed in early 1 995. Any output used from previous GEBOD runs modelling a small female should be reviewed carefully.

VEHICLE MOTION The motion of the motor vehicle can be described using one of four options, as shown in Figure 5. For studying a specific collision, the user typically uses: Option 1 (half-sine wave deceleration) with a specified speed change; or Option 4 (spline fitted position, velocity, or deceleration) using results of a vehicle simulation program such as EDSMAC[3], SMAC[4], or HVOSM[5]. The method described herein utilizes the results of an EDSMAC simulation. Once the vehicle simulation has been completed, the resulting position verses time data is used as input for the ATB program. The velocity or acceleration data may also be used, it simply depends on which data the user selects. For the simplest description of motion, the position and orientation data are the easiest to use. The vehicle position data which is output from most simulation programs is in feet. This data must be converted to inches for input into the ATB program. The EDSMAC program stores the data in the output file in inches. EDSMAC then converts the data to feet for printout. A proprietary program has been written which will read the data in the EDSMAC output file and generate the input data for ATB. This utility program is used to quickly produce a data file containing the EDSMAC crash pulse, in ATB format. This data file is then inserted into the ATB input file using a file editor. The spline fit routine produces a data look-up table of vehicle accelerations, either directly for acceleration entries or by differentiating position and velocity data. This table of acceleration data is then used by the program just as if the user had entered it using Option 3 (six degree-of-freedom deceleration). To clarify, no matter what type of data is input (position, velocity, or acceleration), the spline fit routine generates a table of acceleration data that is then used by the program integrator. The integration routines in the ATB model will then integrate the acceleration data in these tables to produce the velocity and position of the vehicle. The integration routines may not produce exactly the same position data as was supplied, depending on time steps of integration, type of integration, etc. This data can be checked using printed tables generated with the H-cards in ATB. The H. 1 , H3, H4, and HL6 cards should be used to verify that the motion being produced by the ATB model is what the user expects and that the motion and accelerations of the vehicle are reasonable. The H-cards are used in the ATB input file to identify additional time history tables for any segments or joints. These tables may include linear acceleration (H. 1), linear velocity (H.2), and linear displacement (H.3). The segment angular acceleration, velocity, and displacement are available on cards H.4, H.5, and H.6 respectively. Other cards (H.7 through H.10) are available for joint parameters, wind forces, joint forces and torques, and total body properties. The ATB program will also calculate the Head Injury Criteria (HIC), Head Severity Index (HSI) and Chest Severity Index (CSI) if desired, by using the H. 1 1 cards. Option 1 : Half sine wave deceleration impulse (NAT AB = 0) Option 2: Tabular unidirectional deceleration (NAT AB &gt; 0) Option 3: Six degree of freedom deceleration (NATAB &lt; 0 and LTYPE = 0) Option 4: Spline fit position, velocity or deceleration data (NATAB &lt;0 and LTYPE &gt; 0) Figure 5 - Vehicle motion options in the ATB program. One of the limitations of using Option 4 for specified vehicle motion is that only 101 data points may be entered. In order to model a 200 msec, collision, data points for every 2 msec, are output from EDSMAC. For a long ATB run, such as a rollover, longer time intervals may be used or other vehicle motion options are available in ATB. One of the most important items to check is the calculated vehicle acceleration produced in the ATB model. Using the H. 1 and H.4 cards the acceleration produced in the ATB model can be checked against the test data, or vehicle simulation data, to confirm that the approximate acceleration pulse is being produced. Similarly, when utilizing acceleration data for the vehicle motion data, the H.3 and H.6 cards should be used to confirm that the appropriate displacements are being produced during the model integration. The ATB model assigns segment numbers to every object that can move plus one for the ground. Thus, with 15 occupant segments, the first vehicle is segment 16 (NSEG+1). Any other vehicles are numbered accordingly. Air bags are numbered next, then the ground is numbered as the highest segment number. Thus, the ground (NGRND) is equal to the number of occupant body segments (NSEG) plus the number of airbags (NBAG) plus the 275</page><page sequence="4">number of vehicles (NVEH) plus 1 . For the simplest case then, NSEG is 15 for the occupant body segments, NVEH is 16 and NGRND is 17. Note that NGRND can usually be referred to as segment number zero also. The following section describes suggested values on the ATB С -cards when using a crash pulse generated by EDSMAC. The reader should have the ATB User's Guide [1] available to fully understand the variables and suggested input values. In order to use the position data, generated by EDSMAC, the C-cards should contain the following data: Card С. 1 - Appropriate title describing motion data. Card C.2.a - All values should be blank, except: NAT AB - Negative value of the number of acceleration points to be produced, this includes one for the starting time. For example (-201) will produce 201 spline fitted data points describing the acceleration of the vehicle. The maximum number of data points produced is 501 . ATO - First time point of spline fitted data, typically this would be 0.0 to produce a table that starts at 0. seconds. ATD - Fixed time interval (in seconds) for spline fitted data. Typically this would be 0.001 or 0.002 to produce a table up to ABS(NATAB)*ATD seconds. For example, 200*0.001 would produce a table of spline fitted data every 1 msec, up to 0.200 seconds, while 100*0.002 would produce a table of data every 2 msec, up to 0.200 seconds. II - Flag to indicate whether the prescribed motion is relative to the ground (0 - default), another segment (11=2), or is relative to another segment, but with an inverse vector (11=1). The inverse option is used to specify the motion of a reference system relative to the vehicle (useful when using accelerometer data). 13 - The reference segment for the prescribed motion when the II flag is not zero. When using position data from a vehicle simulation, this should be zero to indicate that the positions are relative to the ground. MSEG - The segment number associated with the prescribed motion. The primary vehicle must be the last motion specified, and MSEG must be zero for the primary vehicle. MSEG being zero specifies that this is the last motion data to be input. Card C.2.b - All variables should be blank or zero except: LT YPE - The type of data being input. For position data, LT YPE should be 1 , for velocity data LTYPE=2, and for acceleration data, LTYPE=3. LFIT - The degree of polynomial for spline fitting the input data. For position data, LFIT must be 2 or 3. Usually a value of 3 will produce acceptable results, but the second derivative (acceleration) should be checked by using the H.1 andH.4 cards. NPTS - Number of data points supplied, the maximum number of data points is 101 . Card C.5 - The time, in seconds, for each data point along with the position, in inches, (X, Y,Z) and the orientation data, in degrees, (yaw, pitch, roll). Figure 6 shows a partial output listing from the EDSMAC model of RICSAC case 6. The motion of the Volkswagen Rabbit, vehicle number 2, is modelled in this example. The corresponding ATB input listing is shown in Figure 7. Recall that the output from the EDSMAC run is in feet, while the input required for the ATB model is in inches. The input listing shows the options for position input as described above.

ADDITIONAL VEHICLES - In order to include the second vehicle from this EDSMAC run, a second "vehicle" segment must be defined. This vehicle will be referred to as a "secondary" vehicle, with the distinction being that the occupant of interest is in the "primary" vehicle. In the ATB data input file, there are many references to the "primary" vehicle and some variables will default to this segment, such as occupant reference systems for initial positioning. The secondary vehicle does not need all the B-card information, as long as no other inertial segments will be attached to it . The exact motion will be specified on C-cards. By specifying the next available segment number (MSEG is set to NSEG+1), the ATB program sets up an additional segment This segment has no inertial properties and only contact panels or ellipsoids can be attached to it. In this manner, the second vehicle from the EDSMAC run can be specified. A contact panel is attached to investigate the interaction of the occupant, in the primary vehicle, with the front, hood, side, etc. of the second vehicle. Figure 8 shows a partial listing of an ATB input file using this technique. In this data file, the secondary vehicle is segment number 16, the primary vehicle is segment number 17, and the ground is segment number 1 8. The C-card section now contains two sets of motion data. The first set of C-cards is for the secondary vehicle, 16 15 Largest adult female CARD B.l LT 1 31.001.44621.15071.9651 5.299 8.314 4.866 0.353 0.000 2.094 1 CARD B.2 0.00 0.00 0.0 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.10 0.10 0.10 0.00 0.00 0.00CARD B. 6 EDSMAC SIMULATION OUTPUT FOR VEH 1 IN RICSAC #6 (ATB SECOND VEHICLE) CARD CI 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. -200 0. 0.001 0 016CARD C2A 1 3 101 CARD C2B .0000 .0000 .0000 0.0 .0000 0.0 0.0 .2000 59.2789 4.6024 0.0 11.0669 0.0 0.0 EDSMAC SIMULATION OUTPUT FOR VEH 2 IN RICSAC #6 CARD CI 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. -200 0. 0.001 0 0 OCARD C2A 1 3 101 CARD C2B .0000 146.0000 12.0000 0.0 120.0088 0.0 0.0 .2000 131.8055 66.8012 0.0 135.5376 0.0 0.0 6000000000 CARD D1 1.000 1.000 1.000 00 0 CARD G1A -12.0000 -13.0000 -13.3260 0 17 CARD G2A 0.0000 21.0000 0.0000 321 17 CARD G3A 0.0000 90.0000 0.0000 321 17CARD G3 10 17 0.0 0.0 0.0 CARD H1A - - 1 Figure 8 - Partial listing of ATB input file showing parameters used for "dummy" vehicle. 2 77</page><page sequence="6">with MSEG equal to 16 on card C.2. The second set of C-cards contains motion data for the primary vehicle, with MSEG equal to zero on card C.2. Recall that MSEG being zero signals the end of the C-card section; thus the C-cards for the primary vehicle must be the last set of C-cards. This type of ATB run is useful in studying the interaction between an occupant and the intruding structure of another vehicle. Care must be taken when modelling this type of collision using ATB with motion from a simulation such as EDSMAC. The simulation program is modelling a deformed vehicle while ATB does not model the vehicle deformation at all. Thus, when examining the interaction with the opposing vehicle, the panels used to define the vehicle must be correctly defined to model the deformation which the simulation is predicting. If this is not done, the striking vehicle will appear to intrude much further into the struck vehicle than the simulation is showing, and the results will not be correct. In these situations, a dynamic crush pattern must be established. Additional vehicle panels are then used in the ATB model to depict the intrusion. A "secondary" vehicle is set up with the deformed panels attached to it. The motion for the panels is then defined by specifying the motion of this secondary vehicle. Then using the deformation pattern from EDSMAC (at the specified time from start of impact) and performing an iterative series of runs, the time of interaction between the occupant and the intruding vehicle can be confirmed. OTHER MOVEABLE SEGMENTS - Using a similar technique of a "secondary" vehicle, other moveable interior components may be modelled. This technique involves setting up a "dummy" segment in the B-caids. Unlike the technique described above with the second vehicle from EDSMAC, another segment must be used. Any time a segment with inertial properties will be attached, a "dummy" segment must be used. This specification is required due to the chain setup of the ATB model. The model expects each segment identified in the B-cards to be connected to one of the previously defined segments. For example, the sixth segment specified by the B.2 cards is expected to be connected to one of the first five segments by some type of joint. Thus, if a seat back mass is defined as the sixteenth segment, then the ATB program expects it to be connected to one of the fifteen segments defined previously in the input data. There is a "null" joint option, but this indicates that the segment is not joined to anything, which is not the case for the seat back being modelled. To achieve the appropriate setup, a "dummy" segment is defined as the sixteenth segment with a null joint, then the seat back, steering column, or other moveable segment is segment 17 and is attached to this dummy segment with the joint required. This dummy segment requires values for mass, moments of inertia, etc. on the B-cards. This segment will be used for reference only and will be rigidly attached to the primary vehicle, therefore the actual values used for inertia properties are not important. For simplicity, all the required values are set to unity (1.0). Blank cards are also required for the G.2 and G.3 cards because the dummy segment will be a reference segment. The dummy segment is rigidly attached to the primary vehicle by specifying motion cards that lock the position throughout the simulation, as shown in Figure 9. By attaching the dummy segment at the vehicle e.g., the reference system stays the same as the primary vehicle. Note that the dummy segment could be attached at any location and at any rotation as required. The location and orientation of this dummy segment is an important consideration in simplifying subsequent references using position data of the other "linked" segments. For the seat back model, a mass segment is defined with the appropriate seat back properties, and a contact plane is then attached to this seat back mass segment. The contact may be modelled using segment to segment modelling; however, a rectangular contact plane more accurately models the geometry of the seat back contact surface. The seat back mass segment is attached to the dummy segment with a hinge joint at the proper location on the B.3 cards, and the joint torque characteristics can then be defined either on the B.4a cards or on the E.7, F.5 cards. The ATB graphics output for a seat back model in a rear impact is shown in Figure 10. When modelling a steering column, the lower column is attached to the dummy segment with a ball-and-socket joint. The upper column is attached to the lower column with a slip joint. The steering wheel and hub usually are then attached to the upper steering column using another ball-and-sòcket joint. The joint spring characteristics are defined on the B.4, B.5 cards using data from testing or other published data. When setting up the ATB program to model vehicle intrusion or interior panel movement, the dummy segment is not necessary. In this case a second reference segment is defined, just like the EDSMAC example above. This reference segment can then be moved with respect to the primary vehicle by using position versus time data from the collision simulation or test data.

It is extremely difficult to model any interior intrusion with detailed contact surfaces. The ATB model limits the detail achievable because of limits on number of segments, contact panels, etc. However, the ATB model does have the capability to model this scenario with enough detail to provide insight into occupant- interior interaction which will aid any reconstructionist in understanding the collision. USER CONVENIENCE PACKAGE The most difficult task in running the ATB model is assembling the data file. The model requires force-deflection data for every contact that may occur, joint flexural spring and damping characteristics for every joint, and detailed geometry of the model environment. Assuming that this data is available or may be obtained through testing, the task of generating an input file for the ATB program is still very difficult. A series of programs were written in the early 1 980's to aid in assembling the data file. The programs were called the "Cal-3D User Convenience Package", or UCP[6]. These programs have subsequently been ported down to ЮМ-PC format. The UCP consists of several programs that aid in developing and maintaining a database of vehicle interiors, occupant models, ATB force deflection curves, etc. Using the UCP then allows for easier and quicker assembly of an input data file for the ATB program. Each database consists of the actual data fields, structured in the exact format required by ATB. As the user selects the appropriate data to include, that section is read from the 279</page><page sequence="8">database file and written to the ATB input file. In addition, the UCP programs keep track of the function numbers and will assign them as required in the contact section of the input file without the user being burdened with this task. The UCP programs are then used to assemble the ATB input file by prompting the user for certain information regarding expected contacts, etc. Figure 1 1 shows a partial listing of the program session. The UCP also contains a program that attempts to position the occupant in initial equilibrium. This portion of the package is extremely useful in establishing the initial position of an occupant in the model, but unfortunately, the routine is not always successful. This portion of the package still needs additional work to become completely dependable in positioning the occupant. DISCUSSION The ATB model is a valuable research tool for use in understanding occupant kinematics in motor vehicle collisions. The model can be difficult to use due to the generic nature and wide variety of options available. There are a set of general options that can be used to model occupants as part of a collision reconstruction analysis. The ATB model can be successfully used with collision simulation programs such as EDSMAC, SMAC, HVOSM, etc. In this manner, the ATB model is modelling, as closely as possible, the collision pulse generated by the collision simulation programs. The GEBOD program is a utility program which generates body description data that can be used in the ATB model. The GEBODin version of the program generates invalid data for small females and should be used with caution. An updated version of the program should be available in early 1 995. The UCP aids in setting up an ATB data file and is also useful in maintaining databases of interior characteristic parameters. The routines in the UCP used to establish occupant equilibrium are useful, but require additional research. The utility programs discussed in this paper are extremely helpful in setting up an ATB data set, but like all computer programs, the data produced must be analyzed by a qualified user to assure it is reasonable and that it makes sense. PROGRAM AVAILABILITY The ATB program and the GEBOD program are available for a distribution fee from Armstrong Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. DISCLAIMER The cases presented in this paper are hypothetical. The data has been used for example purposes only and should not be used in any real-world analysis. REFERENCES 1.

Using ATB in Collision Reconstruction As an experienced ATB user, I found this paper to be a good discussion of some of the necessary tasks for using the ATB program for accident reconstruction. The discussion of the vehicle motion, in particular, provides a great deal of detailed information to help the investigator specify vehicle motion with the different available options. The sections on "Additional Vehicles" and "Other Moveable Segments" discuss techniques that advanced users have employed, which have not been formally documented in the past. Due to the complex nature of the ATB program, however, several other tasks associated with ATB modeling (defining functions, contacts, and belts, and initial balancing) were not discussed, for the simple reason that to do so would make the paper much too long for this forum. Given the highly specific details related to the ATB input data, I recommend that the reader have the ATB User's Guide available when reading this paper in order to derive the maximum benefit. #950131 Discussion by Stephen Werner Failure Analysis Associates Using ATB in Collision Reconstruction This paper provides an interesting and useful discusiion of the use of the ATB computer program for simulating occupant motion. This reader will also find the introduction to the GEBOD program useful. A user will find both of these programs to be very helpful and powerful when studying the collision dynamics of vehicle occupants. As indicated in this paper, the reader will find collision analysis programs such as EDSMAC and HVOSM to be excellent sources of vehicle motion data to use as input to ATB. 282</page></plain_text>
