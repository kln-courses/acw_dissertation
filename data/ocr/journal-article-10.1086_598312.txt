      <p>The 15 species of cranes constituting the avian family Gruidae are headliners among charismatic megavertebrates. Appreciation of these birds dates to the dawn of many cultures. They have been celebrated in myth, song, painting, film, and science for their beauty, mate fidelity, and engaging social behavior. But, human civilization being what it is, most of them are now on the verge of extinction. Cranes are large birds living in open wetlands and grasslands that were once far from human populations. As these habitats have been destroyed by drainage, agriculture, and other developments, cranes have declined. A handful of organizations and individuals around the world have been trying to save the cranes, and their efforts have been inspirational to conservationists of all stamps.</p>
      <p>Among the latter is Janice Hughes, author of this most recent in a series of books on cranes stretching back to the 1800s. Like earlier authors, she gives an overview of crane biology (at the beginning) and profiles of individual species (at the end). In between are three chapters on the decline and partial recovery of the North American Whooping Crane (<italic>Grus americana</italic>). This textual organization is awkward, as reflected in the grammatically incorrect title: part of it is about “cranes” (all of them) and part is about the “natural history of a bird in crisis” (the Whooper). Fortunately, both parts are well-written and gorgeously illustrated with color photographs. The information on natural history is concise and up to date, that on evolution is less so, and few scientific or historical sources are given. Nevertheless, it provides adequate context for the author's narrative on the plight of Whooping cranes.</p>
      <p>That story is told in three parts: the decline of Whoopers to a population of less than 30 birds in 1941; the subsequent struggles of conservationists to increase this number to its current value of about 350; and recent attempts at training captive-reared cranes to migrate (e.g., guided by ultralight aircraft). Hughes brings this chronicle to life with a storyteller's flair, interweaving plot lines that follow wild flocks, captive populations, and individual birds. She carefully develops the characters of human and avian protagonists, and gently explains the science behind wildlife management. For example, in Chapter 4, we are given a primer on avian migration biology, then seamlessly caught up in an account of how managers used that knowledge to develop migratory training programs for Whooping cranes.</p>
      <p>Historical drama makes good reading, but attempts to popularize science may go too far, and Hughes often resorts to anthropomorphism and romanticism. The dust jacket declares that cranes raise their young with “tenderness and determination” and innate behavior is “the magic of avian migration” (p. 157). This kind of talk will strike a chord with some readers, but would it not be better to appreciate natural phenomena in their own terms? The text is also judgmental, but perhaps to better effect. I was initially put off by Hughes's blunt condemnation of humans for the decline of cranes, but the details of this story brought me entirely to her way of thinking. When big, white birds that are legally protected and facing extinction still suffer losses due to hunters shooting them “for sport,” even the most rational fence sitter must take a side. The author pulls no punches: “Hunters longed to kill something that was so big and beautiful, and the allure of the challenge was intoxicating to them” (p. 79). The sad truth is that the conservation ethic is not widely embraced. Indeed, Hughes does the now-obligatory calculation of how many dollars a crane species is worth to human consumers—a last-ditch effort to express ecological value in language that most people can understand. Or can they?</p>
