Luckily, today's teachers can take advantage of computer technology and speed up the discovery process in their classrooms. This ar- ticle describes how computer-based instructional programs can be used to engage middle school students in learning about cells. One of these, the Cell Exploration Program, incorporates haptic (simulated tactile and kinesthetic feedback) technology and allows students to manipulate a virtual cell model in a three-dimensional workspace and to "feel" its organelles. Viewed collectively, these instructional programs have the potential to not only have a positive influence on students' conceptions of cells, but also to enhance their understanding of the intimate relationship between form and function, as well as the value of using models to learn about basic cell biology. Understanding the cell The National Science Education Standards communicate in their description of Evidence, Models, and Explanations (a unifying concept and process) that models (including computer simulations) are tentative structures that cor- respond to real objects or events that have explanatory power, helping scientists understand how things work. A second unifying concept, Form and Function, emphasizes that students become familiar with the complementary nature of form and function. More specifically, the form of something is often related to function and vice versa (func- tion frequently relies on form) (NRC 1996). These same standards also make specific recommenda- tions as to what students should know about the structure and function of cells when they leave middle school: Stu- dents in grades 5-8 should understand that cells carry on the many functions needed to sustain life - they take in nutrients, which they use to provide energy for the work that cells do and to make the materials that a cell or an organism needs (NRC 1996). Similarly, these standards also suggest that middle school students should understand that hereditary material in the form of genes can be found in the chromosomes of cells. Despite the existence of such objectives and the in- creased instructional attention that they attract, research has shown that many school-age students have difficulty with basic biological principles, such as the cell. Many stu- dents do not have a "general functional idea of the living cell as the basic unit of life" (Dreyfus and Jungwirth 1989). One source of confusion may be due to students' tendency to take an anthropomorphic view of cell processes (Tamir and Zohar 1991). For example, ideas such as "the cell knows what to take in and what to discard" are widespread (Dreyfus and Jungwirth 1989). James Minogue (minogue@tcnj.edu) is an assistant professor at The College of New Jersey in Ewing, New Jersey. Gail Jones , Bethany Broadwell, and Tom Oppewal are all from the Department of Math, Science, and Technology Education at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, North Carolina. 28 UUiliaUlipTI March 2006</page><page sequence="2">New technologies for teaching about cells Across the nation, more and more middle school students are experiencing computer-me- diated instructional programs that are designed to teach them about the complex "world of cells." The progression from static 2-D images in an inert medium (such as a textbook), to dynamic 3-D models in an in- teractive environment, has the potential to profoundly change the nature of inquiry in science and science teaching. Students immersed in interactive computer "microworlds" may acquire hands-on and minds-on expe- riences that allow them to develop a deeper understand- ing of science concepts (White 1992; Bransford, Brown, and Cocking 1999). The Cell Exploration Instructional Program (see Re- sources) provides an innovative twist to learning about the cell using the PHANTOM Omni haptic device. One device is needed per computer. It can be run on Intel-based PCs (laptop or desktop) with minimum requirements of: a Pentium 933 MHz processor or better, 512 MB or more RAM, Windows XP or Windows 2000 OS, and a qualified graphics card. The computer must also have the haptics software (OpenHaptics). This device is commercially available from Sens Able Technologies for roughly $2,000. Less sophisticated and less expensive force feedback joy- sticks are also available. For example, the Logitech Force 3D, commonly used with home gaming systems, can be purchased for $60. Currently, work is being done to make the Cell Exploration Instructional Program available to classroom teachers, as well as making it possible to run the program using the less expensive feedback device. This program represents the next generation of learner interaction by incorporating haptic technology that ex- tends the students' senses. Students are now able to gain virtual hands-on experiences with abstract concepts, such as the relationship between cellular structure and function and cell membrane permeability (see Figure 1). Through the use of a haptic joystick (the PHANTOM Omni) and a computer, students are able to investigate the anatomy of a cell from the outside to the inside (see Figure 2). The joystick is connected to a computer that controls a point- probe in the virtual world of the animal cell. The joystick allows students to puncture the cell mem- brane and explore the organelles in three dimensions. No longer must students rely on visual feedback alone; as they conduct their explorations, students also receive tactile and kinesthetic feedback. Students can "feel" the flexibility of the cell membrane, the texture of the rough endoplas- mic reticulum, the viscosity of the cytoplasm, the folds of the mitochondrion's inner membrane, and the tangles of genetic material in the nucleus.

Finally, students investigate how molecules traverse the membrane via the various types of passive transport. In a gamelike scenario students are prompted to try to pass these substances through the membrane to reach equilibrium. Another computer program intended to teach students basic cell biology, The Virtual Cell, allows students to use their computer mouse to turn, cut, and zoom in on a 3-D representation of a plant cell's parts (i.e., the chloroplast, mitochondria, and nucleus) (free; see Resources). This program also makes the relationship between models and reality explicit by stating, "As you look around this cell things should look real, however they are models that are only an approximation of the real things. And since we do not want to deceive you, but teach you, we included real electron micrographs." Another free teaching tool is The Virtual Cell Web Page (see Resources). It prompts the user to take a Vir- tual Cell Tour during which students are able to rotate, slice open, dissolve, and zoom in/out on various com- puter-generated images of an animal cell and its typical organelles. This program also provides detailed descrip- tions of basic cell biology and focuses students' attention on the links between a structure's form and its function. Teachers may also take advantage of Thinkwell's Membrane Transport animation for free, part of a series of multimedia tutorials designed to teach biology concepts (see Resources). Here students control the pace and sequence of a highly engaging animated tour of the cell membrane's bi-lipid construction and its intimate relationship to the processes of passive and facilitated diffusion. There are also several programs for studying genetics in the classroom. Cells Alive! is a free computer-based teaching tool, a recent winner of Scientific Ameri- can's Science and Technology Web Awards (see Resources). Its "Animal Cell Mitosis"' section features an interactive animation that demonstrates the various stages of mitosis in an animal cell (see Figure 3). Students can use control buttons to run the complete animation or click on any stage and see a representative image of an actual cell. This site also includes a written description of each stage of the process. There is also DNA Interactive, an incredible resource from the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory's Dolan DNA Learning Center (DNALC) (see Resources). The engag- ing, comprehensive, and freely accessible site is divided into six main sections. The "Timeline" section allows students to take an interactive trip through time and chart the his- tory of the discovery of DNA. Each of the subsequent five sections - "Code," "Manipulation," "Genome," "Applica- tions," and "Chronicle" - provides interactive inquiry-based modules (see Figure 4). Each of these modules contains a problem to solve, the key players involved, and important pieces of the puzzle, and each culminates with a putting- it-all-together section. This final section describes how the problem was solved and engages students in an interactive game to test their newly gained knowledge. Technology use suggestions • Model building - After viewing one of the electron mi- crographs from the Virtual Cell program, have students create a 3-D model of one of these images. Students may also be prompted to develop explanations of why the model of the nucleus they created does not look exactly like the actual image of the nucleus or to describe how their model of the mitochondria's form might be useful in learning about the function of this organelle. This as- sessment helps students develop their visualization skills in 3-D environments. 30 miliHllCOpēļ March 2006</page><page sequence="4">The PHANTOM Omni device from SensAble Technologies, Inc. A Screenshot from the Cells Alive! Animal Cell Mitosis program GENETICS • Hands-on - The Cell Exploration Program and the hap- tic sensations it provides the students are well suited for hands-on assessments. After completing the program, teachers can ask students to make judgments using both vision and touch as to which object from a series of object choices was most like the cell, cytoplasm, mito- chondria, and nucleus represented in the instructional program. For example, the object choices for the cell can be a green balloon, a hard green Styrofoam ball, and a 2-D green circle. Student choices may indicate whether they perceive the cell as 2-D or 3-D. Another form of hands-on activity can involve students in the haptic identification of cellular organelles. Using Crayola's Model Magic, teachers can create accurate models of the cell parts and ask students to identify them using only their sense of touch. American Art Clay Company's Plast-i- clay also allows teachers to create accurate models of the cell parts and then ask students to identify them using only their sense of touch. A large bucket of Crayola's Model Magic mod- eling foam can be purchased for around $15, while a package of four 1/4 lb. sticks of Plast-i-clay costs $2.19. • Open-ended questions - Assess what students learn from Thinkwell's Membrane Transport animation by asking them to consider the following question: "The passage of substances through the cell membrane is actually like the passage of substances through coffee filter paper. Do you think that this statement is correct? Please explain why or why not." Another idea is to have students demonstrate their understandings of the process of diffusion (also part of the Membrane Transport animation and The Cell Exploration Program) by asking them to answer the following question: "A large glass container atop a table is full of clear water. Several drops of dark blue dye are dropped on the surface of the water. Explain what will happen to the blue dye." This can be followed with a teacher demonstration of the above scenario and an opportunity for students to revise their responses based on their observations. • Genetics - Have students explore the Cells Alive! Ani- mal Cell Mitosis website and encourage them to view the animation, as well as read the descriptions of the stages of mitosis. Upon completion have them use what they have learned to create a physical model of the pro- cess. Students could divide a small piece of poster board into sections (one for each phase of mitosis) and use yarn to represent the genetic material and Lifesavers candy to represent centromeres. They can draw what cells look like at the various stages and glue the materials into the different arrangements indicative of each phase. Students can also complete DNA Interactives "Timeline" activity, which provides them with a chance to learn about scientists whose work has contributed to the understand- ing of DNA. Various clues guide students to key facts and figures in the interactive timeline. This activity will also give students a preview of the rest of the DNA Interactive web site. The "Finding the Structure" component provides students with the opportunity to view short video clips of scientists involved in the discovery of the structure of DNA. Using the information from the videos, students are asked to decide whether or not the information on pieces of the DNA puzzle is accurate and correctly correlated with the scientist March 2006 - nopeļ 31</page><page sequence="5">A Screenshot from the DNA ■■■■■ Interactive program Example off one seventh-grade student's pre- (left) HHH1 and post- (right) instruction depictions off a cell. GENETICS named. "Clues to Copying the Code" provides them with the opportunity to view animations of DNA replication and transcription, as well as short video clips of several scientists involved in working out how DNA is copied. Here students are expected to decide which "clues" provided evidence that was used to understand replication and/or translation. Assessing conceptions of the cell These innovative instructional programs bring with them opportunities for teachers to assess their students' under- standing in exciting ways. Teachers may be encouraged to rely less on objective labeling and matching tasks and em- brace a variety of assessment techniques. Begin instruction by assessing what students know about cells. For example, ask students to tell you everything that they know about cells and draw and label a cell. These questions can be used as prompts that allow you to exam- ine their initial understandings from multiple perspectives. They could also be posed to students after they have ex- perienced the program(s), as a pre/post comparison of the student conceptions to help you plan future instruction and make learning gains more evident (see Figure 5). Conclusion Certainly a more robust conception of cells and a more complete understanding of basic cell biology are now with- in reach of middle school students, due in part to recent advances in computer technology that have made the cre- ation of instructional programs possible. Taking advantage of these tools can create an engaging and enriching learn- ing environment in which students can actively build their understanding of the complex "world of cells." ■ Resources The Cell Exploration Instructional Program - ced.ncsu.edu/rianoscale The Virtual Cell - wt utu.life.uiuc.edu/piantbio/cell The Virtual Cell Web Page - tvuw.ibibIio.org/virtuakeWindex.htm Crayola Model Magic - www.crayola.com Thinkwell - www. thinkweil.com The Nanoscale Science Education Research Group - ced.ncsu. edu/nanoscale Cells Alive!
