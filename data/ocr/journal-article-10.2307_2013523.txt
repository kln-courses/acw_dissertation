GEORGE TRUM- BULL LADD. New York: Longmans, Green and Company. 1914. Pp. vi + 311. This is the first in a series of four projected manuals offering in a popular form the main points in the philosophical system of the Yale idealist. These small volumes are to cover the subjects of knowing, doing, believing, and hoping. The first, now before us, concerns episte- mology. The meaning of the question-" What Can I Know? "-suggests a variety of answers from different points of view. The limits of knowl- edge are set between gnoticism and agnoticism, between knowing too much and knowing too little. There are occultists who claim, by some mysterious means, to know how to square the circle and how to apply perpetual motion. There are agnostics who have " too quickly and incon- tinently concluded that they could not know of the existence of a good God, of a soul of their own and in their own keeping, and of the reasoln- ableness of the grounds for a hope of immortality."</page><page sequence="2">248 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY In these words we have the first hint of the three main tenets of Ladd's system. These tenets are absolutism, personalism, and super- naturalism. Yet while the book's purpose seems that of a Christian apologetics, there are certain admissions which appear to frustrate that purpose. The first is the use of the Kantian distinction between sub- jective sufficiency, or conviction, and objective sufficiency, or certainty. This distinction renders ineffective the author's favorite formula-" think- ing one's way through a subject." In place, then, of absolutism we reach pluralism, in place of a block universe, seen practically alike by all " thorough " thinkers, we have a multiverse of many men of many minds. A like fate befalls the second tenet, that of personalism. It is claimed that all trustworthy scientific processes is one of personifying, that " the world of things can be known at all, if known as it really is, only after the anal- ogy of the personality of the knower." If Ladd had left out the words we italicize, his remarks would form an interesting contribution to pan- psychism. But it is unfortunate that the writer adds to the argument from analogy the argument of dynamism, not in a suggestive, but in a dogmatic way. We therefore feel tempted to rearrange the reasoning as follows: The world is not known as a collection of dead stuffs; it is known as a network of centers of force; these forces are perhaps individual wills. Now baldly to identify force with will, as does Ladd, is to miss the very soul of the machine. From the not-dead we are led on to the dynamic, and are then prone to ask, does not pan-dynamism lead on to pan-thelism, the doctrine of an all.diffused force to the doctrine of an all-embracing will? Dogmatically to assert that force is will, is to com- mit the fallacy pointed out by John Fiske when he said that primitive man referred natural phenomena to the wills of personal powers simply because he had nothing else with which to compare them. And yet, as Ladd explains, to range oneself with the physico-chemical sciences, with the strictly impersonal, is not entirely satisfactory. To talk of selves as seats of energies; of energies instead of wills, is to use terms no more repre- sentative of the life of the world than the symbols x and y. As Paulsen has suggested pan-psychism, as a modified form of personalism, has had great allurement for scientific minds from Leibniz to Fechner. With this temptation to unify the whole after the analogy of a larger self, it is strange that Ladd should attack Bergson's intuition as discrediting the intellect. The Frenchman's point of view would be fallacious if it were merely negative. But the doctrine of intuition, as presented in " Creative Evolution," is offered not as a negation, but as a supplement to that very intellectual, chemico-physical method which Ladd considers inadequate to explain a living world. Indeed, he proceeds along the same line as Bergson when he attacks formal logic, and in contradiction to the principle of identity, asserts that the very existence of everything consists in per- petual change, the very essence of the self in ceaselessly changing. With this loosening-up of the old metaphysics, the American ac- knowledges that the same proof and the same evidence have very different effects upon different minds. In short, instead of "being sure of what we know " he confesses that there is absolutely no sure passage, either for</page><page sequence="3">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 249 the individual or for the race, from subjective conviction to objective certainty. Under these circumstances it is hard to see the force of a sub- sequent statement that "there is no scientific or philosophical school, old or new, that is not virtually some attempt at a system of idealism." Such a statement appears to fit better the author's chapter on "taking for granted " than that on " the degrees and limits of knowledge." The " so- called" pragmatist, for example, who considers himself both "scientific " and "philosophical " is quite unable to reach Ladd's limits of knowledge. The typical pragmatist stops short with a pluralistic universe, because he can not reason out a monistic. He accepts an " ill-conditioned jumble of antagonistic existences " simply because he has evidence that this " multi- verse" is not "an orderly and sublimely beautiful and rational whole, a cosmos, a Divine Evolution." In his crucial chapter on " Knowledge and Reality " Ladd claims that the " so-called " pluralistic universe is a rhetorical appeal to the emotions, and a return to a more primitive conception of disparate and ever con- flicting worlds. It is hard to accept either of these strictures and for two reasons. The pragmatic appeal to the emotions was in large measure due to certain inadequacies of intellect. As Ladd himself says: "Reality is not constructed on the square, nor after the strictest of the logic of Aristotle nor the dialectic of Hegel." Again, if pluralism be a return to primitive belief, so is Ladd's constant use of the anthropomorphic argument. It is one thing to hold that what I can know is determined by human limitations; it is another to assert that anthropomorphism is inescapable, that total reality ends in a "Per- sonal Absolute," that the "Sublime Whole" is "Absolute Self."
