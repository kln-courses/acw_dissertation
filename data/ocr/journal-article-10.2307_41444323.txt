<plain_text><page sequence="1">Prayer for a Worldly Society: The Van der Zyl Lecture Lionel Blue One of the most important parts of my training was sit- ting in the study of Dr Van der Zyl and watching him mix cocktails of tradition and realism for the troubled people who came to see him. Each one was mixed individually and to each he added his own special ingredients of humour with a dash of irony. Only later in life did I realise the importance of the last two - humour and irony - because without them religion becomes very heavy and rather dangerous, hijacked unawares by the ego. It is important now to teach people how to mix such religious cocktails for themselves, becaue we have entered a period of do-it-yourself religion (DIY stuff). There is no end to it in sight even should such a state be regarded as untidy or an end to it desirable. The following is not an analysis of the situation that rabbis face, but just a list of symptoms. While Jewish professional bodies have to concern themselves with the problems and puzzles for insiders, such as reciprocal gets, biblical kashrut, technical adulterers, more Jews have become outsiders to their own religion. Since their situation is without benefit of clergy, for their religious needs they have to by-pass the institution, and try to find out if God has a special word for them in their situation. I refer, for example, to people living together in experimental relationships, mixed-faith marriages, homosexuals and lesbians who have come out of their darkness into the light of recognition, one-parent families, couples divorced civilly but without the religious formalities, and marriages or relationships which are stable but not exclusive. Of course such relationships have always existed, but not explicitly; condemned because condemnation was less demanding than comprehension. The emergence of some of them is the result of the sexual revolution which has taken place in our time. With the partial con- quest of VD, and the Pill, procreation and sexuality have parted company. Men and women no longer stick to the rigid roles assigned to them in tradition. She does not have to look up at the ceiling and can read from a scroll if she so desires and knows her vowels. He can put baby before job advancement with no hurt to his male pride. But whatever the reason, in varying degrees they are</page><page sequence="2">misfits in any traditional pattern of Jewish practice, whether orthodox or progressive. Since society is not supportive for them, support can only come from God within them. Since the Holocaust, even many conforming Jews are, spiritually speaking, displaced persons though they seem integrated and observant. Their questions are often left outside their synagogues like their cars and their sex life. These questions are crude but real. In the horrors of the camps where was God, where do we locate Him, and since we don't find it easy to locate Him, does He exist? The second question is related. So many Shemas and Amidahs and Tachanoms must have been said in the cattle trucks going to the gas ovens. Were they ever heard, these prayers, let alone answered? Why say them at all? The religious result of this is that the shell of Judaism has become tougher because a community of tragedy has been burnt into people, but much of the inner core of our religion has become hollow and a question mark has to stand in for faith. The problems are, of course, little different from those of a terminal illness or any other unwanted or unwarranted heartbreak, though they seem different on the communal level instead of an individual one. Nevertheless, all such problems have to be worked through in a person's soul, not in ajournai or textbook. The latter can provide the raw materials of an answer, but it has to be cooked freshly and individually in a per- son's own encounter with God in prayer if any sense is going to be made of it at all. But even communal conformity is not to be taken for granted. Personal decision is required even to avoid the burden of personal decision. The vast majority of Jews make their own anthology of traditional practice. Their compromises are more individual than most would care to admit. It is unlikely that they will ever be stan- dardised again. Such compromises can be unconscious reflections of social and economic changes, or they can be authenticated by the spirit, and the technology of such authentication is prayer. Without such authentication of prayer, such com- promises can be a flight into a wilful ignorance, a desire not to know what is, in fact, known. This produces not spirituality but banality. I would like to cite a cartoon by Steinberg of the New Yorker , which illustrated an essay of Wilhelm Reich. A man is poised in mid-air. One hand stretches underneath his feet and supports him in that insecure position, and he is saying aloud: 'who am I to have an opinion of my own?' It is not comfortble having an opinion of one's own, and a great deal of religion is misused to assist people not to do precisely that - to avoid it. Instead of giving them the courage for growth and awareness, much religion connives at replacing courage with what looks like security. Liturgical prayer can be used for this, and so can private prayer - though private prayer is not so easily manipulated. Certain words have become current in post-war Judaism (and very doubtful words they are); 'authen- tic' is a good example. This is a very tricky word because this authenticity is not found inside oneself but somewhere else, in other people in the group, in an interpretation of tradition. Such words are suspect. They show too many marks of the Steinberg cartoon. It is also true that Jews, like others, are in a very new way free-range in religious matters. Comparative religion is not only studied now, it is experienced by many youngsters and not a few of the more ancient as well. The cult of Hari Krishna, the experience of Evangelical or Catholic Christianity, and the cults of the college campus have touched many. Their attrac- tion, as anyone who has been in contact with them knows, cannot be explained away as just that of a mis- sionary on the make, or a rebellion against the parental home, or the vulnerability of an innocent in a spiritual seduction. Obviously the problem of divided loyalties and family shock which result are neither reflected nor solved in tradition and saying Kaddish for an errant son or daughter is now for the stage, not for life. Parents have asked me to see many such youngsters so that I can pen the lost sheep back into the sheepfold. It is more important to find out what was the attraction of the pasture outside. What food did they get there which was not provided by a caring community? In case after case, the answer comes back to me: 'the experience of God in prayer'. Prayer, as opposed to liturgy, is not exactly encouraged in the synagogue. The occasional intervals of silence in the service are usually quite perfunctory. There is no guidance as to how to use them or how to interpret what is encountered in the silence. Rabbis who have tried to extend these periods have often met opposition on the part of leading worshippers, the strength of which is difficult to explain because the worst that can happen is boredom. Do they fear an encounter will take place, or do they fear that nothing will take place? Frequently terms such as ' goyistf are used which are utterly inappropriate, as personal prayer is part of the Judaic heritage of all western religion. The problem is that our prayer life has become dangerously lopsided. Liturgies steadily become lon- ger, like chewing-gum, and there is so much to say that 23</page><page sequence="3">Prayer for a Wordly Society there is no time to listen. The mechanism of prayer is set in motion, but the end is aborted. In our tradition, listening to the voice of God has been the catalyst for new insight, new paths and religious creativity. Without it there can only be neo or pseudo or pastiche tradition. Abraham conversed with God, so did Jacob, so did the prophets, so did the rab- bis, so did the rebbes, so did Tevye der Milchiger, so even do secular Jewish writers. Only the modern syn- agogue seems estranged from it. I think it is better to admit the lack of faith and trust among the faithful. In liturgical prayer it is possible and right to assume a role. In private prayer it is only possible to start from where one really is. In liturgy it is possible to repeat statements of faith in which one has little conviction, only desire, and I do not think it necessarily wrong to do so. In personal prayer such role playing defeats the object. The concentration on activity in public worship in modern Jewish life is estimable - I don't deny it. Jewish people give and are encouraged to do so, from the pulpit and in all traditional prayers. But there is a specialised form of giving which only rises to the sur- face, say, on the High Holydays and which has not received the attention it requires - and that is giving up. This kind of giving does not involve objects or money but less tangible, though more important matters, such as hopes, illusion, wish-fulfilment, and other contem- porary sleight of hand. Life, of course, consists of receiving and giving up what one has received, with trust and without bitter- ness. Our people are not really prepared for this giving up, whether it comes in the form of illness, bereave- ment, dying or divorce. Coming to terms with these requires each individual to come to terms with his own destiny. It requires prayer and often a special religious adviser. Such problems cannot always be shunted into counselling or therapy. Giving up also has a social dimension, and may be one of the social services we can render to our society. We have tended to view religious objectives in very outward and material terms. The messianic age was seen not very differently from the vision in any social democratic manifesto. There would be a peace, of the United Nations sort, and an era of tasteful, but con- spicuous consumption by everyone. It has also been seen as an extension of a Zionist programme, the physical ingathering of the exiles. These attitudes, which must have seemed so realis- tic once, no longer ring so true. One can be exiled from God in a promised land and close to Him in exile. Ingathering is not just a place on a package tour. I am 24 not saying there is no connection, but it is more com- plex than appears in sermons and appeals. We are also now paying for the cult of religious objects and places which has grown up in the post-war decade. These questions are not rhetorical but real. Does a wailing wall contribute anything to a person's growth? Is Massada pointing a Jewish community in the right direction? It is magnificent of course, but nonetheless a memorial to a failure. We must ask ourselves how the provisions of youth centres and gymnasia can help in the realisation of goodness, maturity and perception. We are a middle-class community with all its good points of responsibility and hard work. We must be careful to project our virtues, not our limitations, onto the cosmos, or we might make God middle-class too, and the awesome and terrifying reaches of space an extension of a garden suburb inadequately supplied with transport. But in the Diaspora the way of increasing consump- tion has petered out. Partly because there is no clear connection between objects and happiness, only with comfort, which is important but not identical. Partly because the supply of objects has itself petered out and everyone has to do more now with less. If this is not to produce bitterness and passing the buck, which are frightening political dangers, then giving up has not merely to be forced on us, it has to be something genuinely accepted in the spirit, like our ageing and change, as one of the dark things we receive from God, yet essential for our growth. I do not pretend this is easy or natural. It is indeed supernatural, but that is what we are called to be. We have to grapple with it through prayer and struggle with it as Jacob struggled with his angel. We have to ask what God is saying to us in our darkness and this needs prayerful listening and attention. But if the way of externals is beginning to peter out, or run out of steam, the adventure into inner space is only beginning. I think the general public has begun to be aware of this before many leaders, for we live so close to the ecclesiastical centre and so much of our effort is spent servicing it. When I visited other Jewish communities many years ago I already noticed that the leaders were worried about organisation, and ordinary congregants were worried about things spiritual. There was a noticeable transposition of roles. There have been great international shows of spirituality filling Olympia and other great exhibition halls. Now a lot of this is mystification, not mysticism, and what James Joyce aptly termed 'y°gi bogi' stuff, but a lot of it is genuinely searching for some help and precision on an inner journey, for some precise infor-</page><page sequence="4">mation about how to have conversation with God or a chat with the cosmos. A friend of mine, who was a pro- fessor of mysticism, was horrified and outraged when I once introduced him to a practising mystic. I think all of us get a little snooty about amateurs venturing into a professional world - it is the same with art historians and artists. Another pointer in the wind which came to my notice is the appearance of a popular edition of that English spiritual classic 'The Cloud of Unknowing'. It was intended by the writer as a guidance for advanced ascetics and contemplatives. Its use by anyone else would be, according to him, both ridiculous or positively dangerous. I notice it is now to be found on bookstalls at London railway stations and is selling briskly to suburban commuters, not previously noted for their ascetic contemplation. Aspects of religion have changed position. In Judaism Talmudic Law, which was once the daily joy of Jewish taxi drivers and traders, is now only accessible to the expert, and mysticism and kabbalah, which were reserved for an elite, are now caviare for the general. Courses on them are, I am told, attractive to adolescents as an alterna- tive to transactional counselling and transcendental meditation. Now prayer is not necessarily words. It is anything which is devoted or given up to God, and God may not even be necessary to prayer - for what's in a name. It is the fact, not the label, which is important in prayer. It is any act which is turned away from the ego and done for its own sake. On this basis, many prayers are anti- prayers and many non-theistic acts are genuine prayers. Prayer can be an act of surrender or giving up or dedication to God. All prayers should be accom- panied by some such giving up or dedication. This may not be a condition of God's, but it is necessary for our own belief in what we are up to. Only when we see the visible result of a chat with an invisible being, then that being ceases to be theological ectoplasm, it begins to solidify into reality. We see its thumb-print on our lives and begin to wonder what we have let ourselves in for. A rather selfish man I know wanted the consolations of religion and they were not forthcoming. More and more he felt a need to do an uncalculated action which went against common sense. On a long distance journey, feeling rather annoyed with himself, he gave up his seat. He told me he knew it was either that or he would receive nothing in prayer. Or even if he did receive something he would never believe it, which is the same thing. The unwilling change in his own life had edged him into belief. It must be God he thinks for no human being had the power to change him before, and he no longer seeks the consola- tions of religion but the God of consolations. That is a greater step forward. This experience is not that rare. Most of us go into religion to use it for our own purposes. I have sat in a synagogue office listening time and again to people explaining why they wish to join, and thinking about the reasons they don't always care to mention. They include a burial plot, a Jesus freak daughter, business advancement, adultery, dressing up, exhibitionism and power. I don't think that any of these matter. All that is needed somewhere in the package is an open chink through which God can enter and be allowed to do His work. Most of us have joined a synagogue to use it. Many of us have, (looking back on what has happened, the time we devote to the synagogue, our soaring telephone bill, and the late night meetings we are all involved in,) realised that we invoked more than we imagined. Instead of using it, it has used us and because of that we begin to believe in it. Up to this point I have tried to talk objectively about what is really a disturbingly subjective business. This talk is, after all, taking place under the auspices of a College which is the Jewish exponent of Wissenschaft and rightly aims to be both analytical and critical. Nevertheless, it is a religious College and there are no doctorates in goodness, or master degrees in maturity. The processes of living religion are untidy and religious needs somewhat shocking. As Madame du Deffand remarked when the Bible was read to her for the first time in her old age: 'who would have thought the Holy Spirit had such bad taste! ' The anthropomorphic bad taste of the Shir Hakavod , the bowel pains of Jeremiah, and the harlot sent by God to chase holy rabbis from the Talmud up a palm tree, all make us wince. The bad temper in Holy Writ on the part of the Almighty, and his servants, is really barely tolèrable in public worship. Though I dislike cutting, I could not stomach the last verses of psalm 137 and insisted that it be left out of the Reform siddur. The insertion of them before the grace after meals is indeed so inap- propriate that one wonders at the mentality that could put them in. A love affair with the Almighty is as untidy as any human one, and feeds in a similar way on fantasy, imagery and occasional emotional self-indulgence, and they are necessary to hot it up. Just as Freud had to come clean about his own masturbation habits (which turned out to be nothing special and quite universal) I must come clean too about my own experience in prayer. I shall, however, only remove a limited number 25</page><page sequence="5">Prayer for a Wordly Society of veils, as I am mindful of my academic purity, and do not want to shame either you or me or this respected institution. But I think it is time we compare notes. It is too easy and too protective to say the Jew does this or the Jew believes that. It is like using that artful English word 'one' when one (that's the writer in disguise) really means himself. I can come clean more easily because Dr Van der Zyl always encouraged me to be honest, though with discretion. Although religion is committed to a search for the truth on the highest level, it often plays fast and loose with honesty on the lower ones. There is, I suspect too much role playing and not enough humour or gossip. This awkwardness will always dog an institution such as ours which tries to produce both learned and good-hearted graduates. The training is just not the same for success in studies and sanctity. The behaviour of German universities or rather the most learned part of the most learned of them in the Hitler time, shows at least that there is no simple connection between educa- tion and compassion. I think it is therefore important that we ovecome our spiritual modesty and reveal to each other what prayer means to us, how we approach it, and what child-like (I have not said childish) devices we use. I shall expose the childlike devices I use to make God real. I think they are justified because the whole search is a logical absurdity anyhow. The first problem with God is that He isn't, there; He is invisible and because we are only just a little higher than the animals, what we cannot sense is not real. It is only because we are the highest as well as the nastiest of the animals that we are sometimes on the edge of experiencing what is non-sensed as reality. We are just able to prevent ourselves from regarding non-sensed realities as nonsense. This is very difficult for us, but possible, because we are also just a little lower than the angels, but our hold on this is shaky. We are swayed by the realism of secularised people with their call to be practical and down-to-earth, which in practice means the smothering of what non-sensed religion is about. A rabbi said on his deathbed that his disciple should fear God as much as he feared an acquaintance. An acquaintance - not a friend. The disciple remarked 'so little', the rabbi replied 'so much'. A lot of prayer is in fact giving a non-sensed reality the feeling of realness which we accord to an acquaintance. I must admit that I am rather suspicious of wise words uttered by rabbis on their deathbeds. There are so many of them and the rabbis are so unnaturally loquacious. But nevertheless the point is valid enough. A lot of prayer is just a way of making God as real to our cowlike state as a 26 chance acquaintance. When I was Chairman of the Rabbinic Assembly I found it very difficult to remain detached. Committees subtly falsify our characters. We take umbrage, we fail to understand, Mr Chairman, what is really quite obvious though unwelcome. We surely cannot believe, Mr Chairman, though everyone believes it including ourselves, because we fixed it before the meeting. Any- way my emotional temperature used to rise and my ego swelled like the chest of an opera singer. There is little time for effective prayer at religious meetings. The mild banalities uttered at the opening are pleasant but not to be taken seriously as prayer. Instead I used to search for an empty chair and seat the Shechinah in it, imaginatively of course. Occasionally I would look at the chair, and be reminded of eternity. I had used a sim- ple device to make God real. It was not as imaginative as one might think. God is of course everywhere and his or her presence in the chair was as true or more true than his or her absence. One may not need the presence of God in a syna- gogue, a rain check can be enough. There is after all not much mischief one can get up to there, apart from pious dishonesty. I have to use original devices much more in such places as a bar or in the underground. Nor do I do it justice by saying it is just a device because I have found, in practice, that I am not the puppeteer of the God I imagine. The suggestions which seem to emanate from my device are not, or do not seem to be to me, my own conventional moralising thrown back at me, but odder, more exciting, more demanding and dangerous than my cautious nature can swallow. Its effects are very different from middle-class prudence. As one goes on, it becomes easier to invoke the presence of God anywhere. A housewife can get used to throwing her apron over her head and having com- munication with God as close as that of Isaac Luria. It is just a matter of habit or convention like opera or any other art. Reality is never experienced directly. If it was it would shatter us. We always apprehend it through conventions. Another way of praying, I have found useful, is not to bother too much with the words of prayers in the books. In many of them the intellectual stimulation is not that high. They are repetitive and, with the change of time, are best possibly used as mantras. Modern ones, too, become inane if overused - and I say this as someone who has written quite a few of them. In Progressive Judaism we have been too formal about prayers, regarding the prayer itself as the end, concentrating too much on its meaning and its enuncia- tion and its history.</page><page sequence="6">Now these things are important, especially if we treat prayer liturgically, but prayer is also a means through which we communicate with God. It is a launching pad or a runway. In chassidic hands the words were evoporated into music and then into sound- less music. A traditional worshipper can daven the words and sense of a prayer out of existence and turn it into a mantra. As a synagogué is not just a lecture hall (though it serves that function too) such techniques are permissible. One aim of a service is not to activate the clever-clever part of one's mind, which is right for exams but not for piety. God often seems to speak to us below the level of consciousness. We find this out to our surprise much later, for though we are not con- scious of receiving any lift or- experience, some seed of humility or perception is being watered and nourished in us without our conscious participation. As I have said before, with many prayers there is no great loss. As in the Kol Nidre the relevance is to be found in the patina which surrounds the prayer, the fact that many people have found God in it, the awe it has acquired over the centuries, rather than in its literal content. But our people feel guilty at letting go the words and I think they need reassurance. God can speak through the words of a prayer while we are dozing, as well as in the words of a prayer while we are at full alert. Sometimes only one word matters, an irrelevant word in the prayer, but very relevant to our situation. Such a chance word should be considered carefully because it may be God's word to us. I should like to point out some of the problems of prayer. One problem arises because it is, at least on the nursery slopes, rather fun and one can easily get addicted to it. It can turn into undemanding moony cosiness. Thinking about someone sentimentally is not the same thing as praying for them and that is work. In a hedonistic society after drink, drugs and sex, the last and most sophisticated high in reach is mysticism. Since the aim of prayer is the abrogation of the ego - the bitul hayesh - then it doesn't do anyone much good if you're going to make your hedonism cosmic. The pleasure is a legitimate one and should be enjoyed when it comes, but you must not hang on to the pleasure of prayer or think God does not exist because you have not had your daily shot of ecstasy. Another problem arises out of increasing progress and familiarity in prayer. There is a temptation to become smug, and look down in a kindly self-pitying way on your non-praying friends. You don't know what the point of their life is, so only God can compare your spirituality with theirs and in this area competition doesn't apply. Because of this superiority feeling, people pray at each other, not with each other or for each other and I have been at both ends of this rather nasty experience. There are many things of which I am told I should be ashamed in life and am not. But this misuse of prayer for one-upmanship or aggression or spiritual pride is the only thing I regret most deeply in my life. It is a blasphemy in a deep sense and a chilul has hem. There is also a desire to flaunt prayer as a weapon in a holy war, to parade one's traditionalism for example, or one's radicalism as a banner or a flag, or to show one's membership of some group. Since the aim is to make one's fellow uncomfortable by making him feel an outsider, it is not prayer even if the worshipper, so- called, is garlanded with objects of devotion like a Christmas Tree. This was a problem for me when I was a rabbinical student and affected me especially at that point because of my insecurity in relation to the burden of expectation that was put upon me. Another problem arises because of the distance which separates God and man. To cover that distance we only have two possibilities. We can either grow bigger towards God or upwards towards Him, or we can bring Him down to our level and make Him as small as ourselves. God's love and impartiality worry us (once again the competition motif). How can He love us if He loves our neighbour and our enemy as well, because each one of us wants to be loved alone. So we use prayer to tribalise God. We say ' Gott strafe England ' or ' God save the Queen ' or any other com- munal cry. By all means let God save the Queen - 1 do pray it in all sincerity - but improbable as it may seem, He is not partial like us and He loves Mr Brezhnev, Mr Begin and Mr Arafat as well. Any prayer should make us want to do so too. I can hear the objection: such a thing is not natural - how can a Jew want to love Mr Arafat. Of course it is not natural, but neither is prayer. To like people who like you is natural. That does not require prayer - it is instinct. To like someone who does not like you is more than natural, it is supernatural and that requires work, avodah, prayer. There is another problem with love which comes out of the innerness of group prayer. We sometimes try to cheat our way through this problem rather than face it. We use prayers to increase our love for our own family, own group, own religion, by withdrawing love from everyone else. This seems to increase love at the begin- ning, but at the price of mortgaging future religious growth. I have said before that all of us come to religion and to prayer with the wrong questions and the wrong 27</page><page sequence="7">Prayer for a Wordly Society demands. The trouble arises if we stay with them, after we have learned better. There is no harm in asking 'God give me this', or 'God give me that' provided you know you might not get it, and approach it with the same humour as Topol in 'If I Were a Rich Man', All that we know that God can give us is Himself. He will also let us find Him, we are told, if we seek Him in the dark places of our life and He will come and live with us. But do we want Him inside us? At a certain point in our prayer life, the consequences of prayer sharpen dramatically. It is no longer a pleasure, it is a demand for internal change. As in any other relationship, we have to ask ourselves if we want to go on and venture out of our depth. It is only when we are out of our depth and stumble, leaning on God who doesn't seem to be there, that we pass our eleven plus in religion. Although we are told not to make any images of God, mentally at least we have to do so; but we must keep the provisional 'as if quality of all these images at the back of our mind. We must certainly be careful not to identify God completely with any of them. The images would not then make us children of God, just very childish adults. Another problem concerns textbooks on spirituality. For myself I find them helpful, but too systematic and orderly for such a strange activity as prayer. I have never been able to ascend branch by branch a sephirotic tree, or proceed steadily through the rooms of an interior castle. At one moment I have a glimpse of the reality I am going towards and then I am back at the foot of the tree, or find myself sitting in the castle moat. I think one must be prepared for a more erratic journey. The realisation of God comes and goes as our attention flickers. Provided after each fall we turn our attention back to God, then I do think something begins to change inside us. One part of us becomes invested in eternity. Perhaps eternity just ceases to feel foreign, and begins to feel like home. One of the difficulties in prayer is that we are not at home with God or with our own religion. We have lost one form of innocence with our enlightenment, and we have not recovered another. Religiously we are like adolescents at that awkward in-between age. The view from a pulpit is revealing. I watched a lady once at the High Holydays sitting stiffly in her seat trying to mouth the unfamiliar Hebrew vowels. Her clothes were unfamiliar too for they were her best and not broken in. I watched her as she dropped her handbag and lost her place in the book, turning the pages the wrong way, and with a slight creak from her corsets she suddenly leaned back and her lips said 'damn! ' That was the first prayerful word she had said because it was the first 28 honest word. She could now pray because she was not on her best behaviour but starting off from where she was. One of our difficulties is that we have cleaned up religion to such an extent that we have made it too nice for the purpose it serves. What do we do with our anger, our aggression, our ambition and our bodies? Do we leave them outside in the car park or disown them and leave them like cars on shabbos a few streets away? But there is a difficulty. Our bad inclination, as the Talmud knew, is also the source of our energy, our drive and of civilisation. In any case it is not that easy to abandon parts of one's own personality. We carry them into the synagogue with us, where they enjoy a festering hidden life of their own. They are only the unloved and rejected parts of ourselves. They are res- ponsible, I think, for those silly and tedious rows which rock all religious institutions where the apparent issues never adequately account for the emotions aroused. In a less holy place, such as a pub, the problem would be more overt. This is a problem which affects all religious groups. If you turn on the radio and listen to the voices in religious services, you hear a peevish whining quality which comes from the expurgation of the speaker's humanity. The service of the heart is not the result of imposed good behaviour but of inner transformation. I think we must examine prayer again, and not the good bits but the nasty bits. The terrible complaining and vindictiveness that are found in the psalms may be as necessary for us as roughage in our diet, though I have been so conditioned by middle-class niceness that I do not know how to use them in the public worship setting. In a similar way the Torah is not as nice as the Book of Jewish Thoughts and we have to relate its bloodymindedness to our own, and Kal v'homer with the Haftarot. Unless the instinctive part of us, our bad part, is exposed to the air and the light of prayer in God's presence, we might fool ourselves so that it never gets healed and we might even fool ourselves that the bad part isn't even there. Much of the strained relationship is because we have not only tried to be too nice (I have not said too good) we have tried to tidy up the Almighty as well. In liturgy we ask God to forgive us. 'You have done justly,' we say, 'but we are responsible for everything that has come upon us.' But this is not true for many of us. If we were very holy, and released from our egos, we might have a self-perception which could make such words valid and true, but the statement does not fit the relativism of our background or our understanding of cause and effect. We can know reality as love and we</page><page sequence="8">can know it as power. In the latter aspect it is remote and the universe indifferent to our pleasure or pain. Through prayer we might begin to discern the love in the power, but it is not easy and our hold on such a terr- ible truth can only be shaky. The real and unvoiced problem was not, I felt when I used to take services, God forgiving us but our forgiving God. I think in the end they are the same thing. Both mean trust and an acceptance of our destiny. But it is important not to appear more saintly than we are. This is the difficulty with praying other people's prayers. While you are praying them, you identify with them, and when you are away from them, you know you are very far from their certainties. What is the connection between our private prayers and the liturgy? I do not believe they can ever be quite the same, nor can our own faith ever be identical with the faith of a book - whatever book. No matter how good a book is, it is always the statement of faith of other people at other times with another experience of life. It will never, and can never, be the same as our own and I do not regard this as tragic. It used to worry me and I wondered if I was a hypocrite taking services. I no longer think so, or if so, for other reasons. The books I worship from contain the faith of the past, of all that my ancestors believed in and when I take part in a service my own faith converses with the faith of my ancestors, which is the faith of the book. I begin, when I take a service, to attach and connect my own experience to theirs - it is a conversation. And so, in a humble way, my own faith joins that great succession of commentaries upon commentaries upon comment- aries which go to make up Jewish literature. There is another problem I have with services, and that is as a professional. At the beginning of my career, I used to think that all prayers should be said with feel- ing which I confused with kavanah or intention. My feeling prolonged the services inordinately and many dinners became burnt offerings to appease my spirit- uality. Then feeling disappeared, for it is impossible to live on a permanent high. I could not shut up shop and put a notice outside the synagogue saying the Rabbi was suffering from a bad attack of doubt accompanied by loss of feeling, and the services should be cancelled until such time as his faith recovered. Like any pro- fessional worth his salt, I dragged myself to the pulpit, tried to smile benignly and asked the congregation to turn to page 14. I said the service with expression because one can put that on, but without feeling or intention. God was either irrelevant, obnoxious or non-existent as far as I was concerned. I felt very uncomfortable in my robes with my strange headgear. I did my best, but later on my teacher pointed out that those were the best services I had ever said. For once I had forgotten my own needs, even my spiritual ones, and concentrated on the needs of others. In religion, feelings are extra. Because praying is subjective, that does not mean that it is emotional, unbalanced and against common- sense. All love is subjective, and the love of God is no different from any other. Apart from His invisibility, it is possible to get acquainted with God. As in any other relationship, you have to meet, you have to corres- pond, you have to find time to chat and get to know each other's language and what both of you really feel about things. Every humanist I know communicates with his values. But religion begins when your values begin to possess as much reality and substance as a human being and eventually more - when they are not sub-personal but become supra-personal - when they are so alive that they can answer back and can help you to thoughts and actions which startle and amaze you. Much of this must seem absurd, and indeed it is. We are so used to the practice of prayer that we forget what a strange thing prayer is. We are trying to communi- cate at the absolute limit of our perception. We are for- ced to image infinity in finite terms. At infinity, all logic fails and we can only work with paradoxes which we may learn to state more clearly, but paradoxes can never be solved. Our only possibility is to learn to live with them. We should try to understand prayer in a pragmatic way. We should start by trying it and look- ing at the effect of it on ourselves and on other people. Its nature is more incomprehensible than its results. We need not feel ashamed of this way of going about things. Science uses the same method for equally mys- terious phenomena. Perhaps the most important benefit of prayer is not that we abrogate ourselves, but that we recover our- selves - our true selves. The rise of advertising, the importance of the media has made us all play roles to each other and to our own vanity. In prayer we act out our lives before God. He is differennt from all other audiences because with Him there is no respect of per- sons, nor taking of bribes, no matter how subtle. We are naked, really naked, not just wearing a change of clothes. Prayer is a very fragile thing but its fragility gives it certain benefits. As Pascal said ' tout lasse , tout casse , tout passe ' (everything lets go, everything breaks, everything passes away) and that applies to all objects and institutions in religion whether holy or not: castes, tem- 29</page><page sequence="9">Prayer for a Wordly Society pies, synagogues, states and organisations. But if religion is time and again reduced to a handful of stories and the practice of prayer, which it has been in the past, then it can still function as a channel between this world and eternity. We do not know the world in which we live - marxist or fascist, permissive or authoritarian, suppressing religion or distorting it. If we have found that temple within ourselves and have done it by do-it-yourself means, then we have made provision for our own souls and the rest is in God's hands. The future is so uncertain that we cannot know what will be permitted in it or relevant to it. In our hearts there is programmed a longing for the inconceivable and a desire to communicate with it. Such a deep need will always find its expression whatever the system. It requires no equipment, just the will to do it, and what is Judaism built on but a few such conversations. Prayer is a way in which we can prepare ourselves for that uncertain future which will always surprise us, as the future always does. But if we have trained our- selves to see God in the surprise, we might be better able to absorb it and grow with the surprise without fuss. There was a time when religious leaders were very certain of themselves and of their answers. Now we are more hesitant and more humble. We have learned from counselling and therapy, for example, that it is better to help people find their own answers. There may be pro- visional answers, they may be wrong according to our lights, but they have one great virtue - they are their own. If we can help people to pray, we teach them the technology of the spirit by which they can help them- selves. Dr Van der Zyl has the humour and courage to trust other people, to let them range freely in spiritual matters. He showed me that Judaism was not our religious prison, it was our religious home, and that as a Rabbi I was not God's Gestapo or policeman; and I shall never forget that teaching. 30</page></plain_text>
