Early Boy Scout officials claimed that conserving natural resources taught members the expert management, scientific efficiency, and civic responsibility needed to balance virility and Victorian self-control and to maintain leadership of a modernizing society. The Boy Scouts' "modest manliness" also suggests a different mainstream resolution to middle-class men's anxieties in this era from the virile primitivism through strenuous sports or playing Indians and pioneers outdoors stressed by most gender historians. ON THE FIRST page of the Boy Scouts of America's fourth annual report for 1913, Chief Scout Executive James West articulated a key concept entitled the "Conservation of Boyhood": "Conservation of our national resources is univer sally approved, but of what value would material resources be unless we con serve the moral, intellectual, and physical future of the coming generation? Prevention is recognized as better and less expensive than cure. The Boy Scout movement takes the boy at that time of life when he is beset with the ? 2010 The Author.

In this manner our character building movement has done much in numerous cities to diminish the problem of juvenile delinquency." Conservation became a linchpin of Scouting ideology, a handy way to meld the Scouts' four principal concerns: "modest manliness," training leading citizens, reducing juvenile delinquency, and managing nature and its resources. The immense popularity of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) as well as the state's blessing of the organization suggest that many Americans shared the same preoccupations. BSA leaders used the growing popularity of natural resource conservation to update Victorians' and psychologists' concepts about conserving boys' energies, bodily fluids, and evolutionary development. The era's feminine associations with wilderness preservation and the virile yet selfish and primitive values attached to emulating frontier pioneers or Indians were of limited use to native born white, middle-class men attempting to maintain dominance over a chan ging nation. Conserving natural resources taught Scouts to balance virile self reliance with scientific efficiency, expert management, firm self-control, and civic leadership. The conservation of boyhood superseded pioneering and became the BSA's dominant teaching strategy through the 1930s. This shift enabled the predominantly white, middle-class Scout boys and men to stay atop America's urbanization, corporate-driven mass production, scientific man agement, and progressive government.1 Analyzing the BSA's conservation of boyhood simultaneously challenges the existing environmental, gender, and Boy Scout historiographies on the 1910s and 1920s. It is no coincidence that the BSA blossomed in the midst of preser vationists' and conservationists' battle over the fate of the Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite National Park. Many environmental historians assume that this 1906-1913 struggle neatly split reformers between the victorious, utilitarian minded natural resource conservationists and their wilderness preservationist opponents led by lohn Muir, who had hoped to leave the scenic valley undammed as a spiritual and moral retreat from modern life. Carolyn Merchant, Glenda Riley, and Jennifer Price have argued that women sought the conservation of womanhood, childhood, and home through their environ mental activism in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Price argued that moral and childhood-based arguments advanced for the bird con servation campaigns of the 1890s focused exclusively on womanhood. Merchant stated that public enthusiasm for conservation declined for two decades after it was professionalized by men in the wake of the Hetch Hetchy controversy. Adam Rome argued that after John Muir and his losing wilderness preservation campaign were slandered as feminine and domestic, male activists increasingly pursued natural resource conservation's material resource extrac tion and business and scientific priorities-and stopped cooperating with female environmental activists and their emphasis on conserving morality and childhood. Boy Scouting, however, generated a staggering spectrum of</page><page sequence="3">614 | ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY 15 (OCTOBER 2010) popular, government, and corporate support from both men and women by articulating a middle environmental ground. BSA men insisted that nature was alive with the history of America's forefathers and held the key to solving the era's masculine, urban, and adolescent delinquency problems. They argued that forests should be set aside to expertly develop Boy Scouts' modest manliness by combining virile self-reliance gained through camping and hiking in picturesque settings with learning firm self-control, scientific management, and civic leadership through conserving natural resources. The BSA emphasized that leading boys and men had the most compelling moral obligation to conserve the nation's natural resources. Boy Scouting taught that by conserving natural resources, members would simultaneously conserve and develop the nation's most valuable resource, its boyhood. Instead of men rejecting or ignoring women's moral and childhood-based arguments for con servation, the BSA co-opted them in order to maintain white male dominance over American society and its resources. Boy Scouting served as a key force popularizing conservation in what has been characterized as a lull in popular environmental activism, bridging early conservation enthusiasm and the New Deal. Indeed, Franklin D. Roosevelt's eighteen years of BSA service prior to becoming president of the United States heavily influenced the development of the Civilian Conservation Corps.2 Many gender historians have argued that a native-born white, middle-class masculinity crisis instigated the turn-of-the-century outdoor-living craze as a surrogate for the rugged individualism of American pioneer and Indian mythol ogy and for passing modes of pre-industrial labor. Many works cite the success and longevity of Boy Scouting as a key proof that primitive, virile individualism through outdoor adventure and competitive, strenuous sports had replaced Victorian self-control and modesty as the dominant model of American mascu linity. Gender historians have quoted the same few early BSA sources that stressed playing pioneers or Indians to teach members virility and self-reliance, but this mentality soon came under fire for encouraging Scouts to be too selfish, aggressive, and wasteful. BSA national administrators shifted the focus of Scout environmental and boy character training from playing primitive pioneer and Indian to the simultaneous conservation of natural resources and boyhood, though tensions between these priorities resurfaced throughout the 1910s and 1920s. In light of the BSA's rapidly expanding membership and broad range of popular and government support, its leaders' gravitation toward conservation suggests the emergence of a very different, longer-term resolution to masculine anxieties than that identified by most gender historians.3 This analysis of the conservation of boyhood also disputes how the historio graphy on the BSA has assessed the organization's masculine and environ mental teachings and the reasons for Scouting's striking popularity and overwhelming victory over competing youth organizations. David Macleod, the foremost authority on early BSA history, argued that Boy Scouting helped</page><page sequence="4">CONSERVATION OF BOYHOOD | 615 middle-class parents control their adolescent boys by prolonging their state of dependence and channeling their energies "into boyish sports or anachronistic woodcraft, neither of much utility in modern life." Macleod assumed that Scouting emphasized nineteenth-century character values and nostalgia for rural boyhood, which led him to downplay the significance of gender ideology in Scouting-even as modern masculine concerns continued to surface in his evidence. Jeffrey Hantover, who has focused the most attention on early BSA masculinity, argued that the BSA taught boys and men to preserve nineteenth century masculine self-reliance, individualism, and competition in the face of modernization. Macleod and Hantover correctly identified a strain of nineteenth-century manhood in Boy Scout teachings, but they failed to recog nize the balanced emphasis on modesty and modern masculine virtues. Instead of primitive individualism or nostalgia for a simple rural boyhood, the BSA in fact combined Victorian self-control and a contained virility with natural resource conservation's adult-like efficiency, scientific analysis, expert management, and civic leadership. This modest, balanced, and modern manliness helped the predominantly native-born white Scouts maintain their dominance over America's corporate-industrial workforce and its progressive government. Local Scout practice generally conformed to BSA national leaders' rhetoric and teachings, demonstrating the widespread popularity and application of BSA gender and environmental ideas.4 Shifting to the intertwined conservation of boyhood and natural resources enabled the BSA to beat out competing boy organizations that actually and con sistently focused on virile self-reliance through playing Indians or pioneers or teaching other extreme and narrow masculinities. Ernest Thompson Seton (a white Indian lore expert who started the Woodcraft Indians organization in 1902) and Daniel Carter Beard (a frontier pioneer enthusiast who founded the Sons of Daniel Boone organization in 1905) were both forced to join with the new BSA in 1910 because their organizations failed to garner significant mem berships or public support. The BSA quickly engulfed a slew of competing American Boy Scout organizations that emphasized a single principle like pacif ism, militarism, automobile highway safety, or first aid training-to the point that few people today are even aware that these alternatives ever existed. The Protestant-dominated Young Men's Christian Association, the leading boys' camping organization in the late nineteenth century that ran the fledgling BSA in 1910, gradually adopted a Seton-like Indian Guides program and was sur passed by Boy Scouting. Seton and Beard, squabbling with each other for control over the BSA, both lost ground to the progressive bureaucrat lames West. West had replaced a YMCAman, Edgar M. Robinson, as the administrative head of Boy Scouting in 1911-the same year that the BSA moved out of the New York City YMCA office and into its own headquarters on Fifth Avenue. Seton was expelled from the BSA in 1915 for his radical, egalitarian gender and race ideas, critiques of blind patriotism, and wilderness preservation senti ment. Beard emerged as the figurehead of the BSA, but West's control of the</page><page sequence="5">616 | ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY 15 (OCTOBER 2010) bureaucracy countered Beard's authority and popularity. This combination helped the BSA achieve a winning balance between Beard's primitive pioneering and the bureaucratic efficiency, scientific analysis, and expert management represented by West and natural resource conservation.5 The notion of conserving boyhood was rooted in nineteenth-century Victorian, middle-class notions of conserving male bodily fluids and energies by not masturbating or over-exerting oneself physically or mentally. By conser ving their bodies, Victorian boys would develop into self-controlled young men capable of becoming self-made in the emerging industrial-capitalist economy and expanding western frontier. However, the "closing of the frontier," rapid urbanization, corporate bureaucratization, the "New Woman," the "New Negro," and "new immigrants" from southern and eastern Europe challenged native-born white men's authority at the turn of the twentieth century. This prompted some men to criticize the Victorians' restrained idea of manhood for being too passive, feminine, and over-civilized. According to psychologist Granville Stanley Hall's 1904 Darwinian theories of adolescence, white boys should conserve their natural evolutionary development by recapitulating the racial stages of civilization as they aged. With the proper outdoor setting and role modeling by worthy men, white boys could navigate the treacherous stage of adolescence, recapitulate into civilized white manhood, and save the race from being overtaken by nonwhites and immigrants. Hall's racial recapitu lation theory and related efforts to invigorate masculinity by playing "savage" Indians or reliving the pioneer life, however, too easily lapsed into a selfish pri mitivism that taught white males to resist a modernizing society rather than adapt to and maintain control over it.6 The BSA's conservation of boyhood modernized Victorians' and Hall's con cepts by linking them to the growing popularity of natural resource conserva tion and concern for preventing juvenile delinquency. As National Scout Commissioner Dan Beard explained in 1913, "You have seen a lot in the papers about conservation of our resources. The most valuable resource we have are the boys of America. Every boy who goes astray and becomes a misfit and a failure is a great loss to the assets of this country. Every honorable, brave, efficient boy is a tremendous asset to this country. The Boy Scouts of America is the greatest conservation society in the world, for we are working to conserve the boys." Just as public lands faced threats of despoilment through unregulated development-and conservationists responded through programs of efficient resource management-leaders claimed that Scouting could save adolescent boys threatened by city rot, commercial leisure, the het erosocial youth culture, and the feminization of home, school, and church. BSA officials argued that conserving boys' character and training them for civic leadership were the most important uses of public lands and natural resources. National leaders argued that Boy Scouts' ability to conserve natural resources demonstrated their advanced character and justified their authority over black Americans, Native Americans, working-class immigrants,</page><page sequence="6">CONSERVATION OF BOYHOOD | 617 and females-groups characterized in BSA sources as being too primitive, selfish, or sentimental toward nature to conserve it.7 BSA administrators' increasing emphasis on conservation and a balanced, modern manliness paralleled shifts in mainstream environmentalism and the broader American society. The pioneer and his independent assault on the fron tier wilderness had moved from reality to being memorialized in fiction and film. Federal officials continued to preserve supposedly pristine landscapes in national parks and monuments, but many were in areas unfit for commercial development. Conservation was increasingly institutionalized and became established practice in government land management agencies by the 1920s. Leasing public lands for large-scale, private, commercial development was wide spread. Industrialization and urbanization seemed increasingly inevitable and accepted by most Americans. The progressive efficiency craze of the 1910s, which included projects ranging from Americanizing immigrants to the scien tific management of factory labor through the engineering methods of Frederick Taylor and Henry Ford, reflected conservation priorities much more than those of preservation or pioneering.8 CONFLICTS: PIONEERING AND CONSERVATION BSA national leaders' embrace of conservation as the organization's overarch ing teaching strategy was the product of a drawn-out debate over the 1910s and 1920s. Feminized spiritual wilderness preservation swayed few BSA national leaders in this period, but pioneering nature and masculine ideology still held significant appeal. The belief that the western frontier had closed to new settlement in the 1890s fueled and reflected a sense among middle-class urbanites that American men's heritage of self-reliance, opportunity, and viri lity were under siege. In the BSA's first few years, some of its publications and speeches used pioneering and Indian motifs. Scout activities such as chop ping down trees to build campsites and log cabins offered a dose of the pioneer life in an all-male setting that was safely isolated from America's over-civilized cities and mass culture. However, growing criticisms made by government offi cials and conservationists of Scouts' destructive and wasteful environmental practices suggested that pioneering conflicted with the self-control, civic lea dership, and scientific efficiency demanded by modern America's corporate industrial economy and progressive reform climate. BSA leaders increasingly deployed natural resource conservation to teach this second set of values and to defuse charges that Scouting encouraged boys to be selfish savages, but they had to do so in a way that still allowed members to demonstrate their superior manhood. In effect, BSA administrators incorporated a model of virile manhood into an environmental outlook that celebrated efficient natural and personal resource conservation for the greater good rather than for the pioneer's individual conquest and aggrandizement. Scouts, however,</page><page sequence="7">618 | ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY 15 (OCTOBER 2010) Figure 1. How to Climb a Tree That Is Too Thick.

While this sketch in the first American Boy Scout handbook suggested that pioneer-like adventure was the primary purpose of outdoorsmanship, later editions of the handbook would emphasize avoiding the wasting of trees for such purposes as well as planting trees for more efficient and future uses. Credit: Ernest Thompson Seton and Robert Baden-Powell, A Handbook of Woodcraft, Scouting, and Ufecraft (New York: Doubleday, Page, &amp; Company for the BSA, 1910), 63. continued to pioneer symbolically through pageants, woodcraft, hiking, and camping.9 In the early 1910s, BSA national leaders and local practices suggested that pioneer lessons in virile self-reliance might be as or more important than con serving boyhood or natural resources. The first BSA publications and rank and merit badge tests emphasized that boys should chop down trees with axes to relive the pioneer life. Figure 1, a sketch in the first American Boy Scout hand book, bluntly explained that if a tree was too thick to climb, then a boy should cut down a nearby tree and lean it into the target tree as a ladder. The first two boys' handbook editions (in service from 1910 to 1914) carried extensive instruc tions on how to build a log cabin, but with no warning against using live trees.</page><page sequence="8">CONSERVATION OF BOYHOOD | 619 One Second Class rank test required knowing "the proper use of knife and hatchets, which are about the most useful implements of a backwoodsman. In fact a good camper, hunter, or mountaineer would be lost without them." To earn a Pioneering merit badge, boys had to cut down a tree at least nine inches in circumference and build a bridge and a shack. Scouts throughout the country built pioneer cabins and bridges-even indoors or in flat, dry areas where bridges were not needed. Scout troops often constructed lookout towers and log cabins at camps or well-attended public demonstrations in urban stadiums. Such projects proved Scouts' resourcefulness while embodying the notion that they were society's vanguard.10 Early Boy Scouting also used pioneering to connect members to male patrio tic heroes from America's past. The frontier pioneer served as an attractive type of scout because he led white civilization in its virile conquest of the wilderness and its "savage" Indian inhabitants. Pioneers exemplified American men's inde pendence, self-reliance, and resilience while bravely protecting the women and children in their care. In his instructions in the third major edition of the Boy Scout handbook (first published in 1914) for building a log cabin, pioneer lore expert Dan Beard argued, "There is scarcely a great man in early American history who did not know how to wield an axe, and all were either born in a log cabin or lived considerable time in such a home. Although George Washington was skillful in using the axe, one of the greatest axmen among our great men was Abraham Lincoln. It might even be said that American history was written with an axe." Across America, troop and council pageants honored Washington, Lincoln, Daniel Boone, and Davy Crockett as pioneer Scout ancestors. Like historian Frederick Jackson Turner's 1893 frontier thesis, early BSA literature pointed to pioneering as evidence of the triumphant evolution of white American men and their nation-state.11 Government officials and conservation experts recruited to write for BSA publications in the mid-1910s, however, criticized the savage attitude and environmental waste encouraged by Scout pioneering activities and helped lead the organization's shift toward conservation. These authors had to rene gotiate Scouting's powerful linkage of pioneering, virile patriotism, and a cele bratory interpretation of American history. The nation's need for materials and citizens' loyalty to fight World War I strengthened the BSA's emphasis on conservation. George Sudworth, the United States Forest Service's Chief Dendrologist, cri tiqued pioneering by merging the Victorian quality of manly self-control with the modern emphasis on white men's expert management and scientific analy sis. He suggested in a 1917 article in Scouting (the magazine for Scoutmasters, the adult troop leaders) that the self-control and scientific judgment associated with conservation demonstrated the superiority of mature white men, while boys playing pioneer bordered on savagery. Sudworth equated the legend of George Washington chopping down a cherry tree with the primitive and childish act of torturing innocent animals. The author called on a maturing Scout's</page><page sequence="9">620 | ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY 15 (OCTOBER 2010) Figure 2. Civilization Levee. The sketch associated wild nature with wild, bad manhood.

He argued that the conservationist's tactic of using dead and downed trees would suit most of the legitimate needs that Scouts had for wood. When there were no dead or downed trees, Sudworth advised scientifically identifying and using trees that were worthless as lumber. This discriminating approach facilitated Scout pioneering projects and ceremonial campfires while buttressing the concept that the ability to con serve natural resources was the distinguishing characteristic of leading male citizens.12 During World War I, BSA leaders used conservation projects and imagery to encourage members to contribute to the American war effort. The 1918 Scouting magazine sketches in figures 2 and 3 juxtaposed the efficient, conscientious</page><page sequence="10">CONSERVATION OF BOYHOOD | 621 Figure 3. U.S. Liberty Tree.

In figure 2, BSA staff artist Frank Rigney characterized German mili tarism as a faceless flood preparing to dash civilization. He equated the American war effort with a levee's ability to protect human communities and material production from violent river flow. The Boy Scouts and their contri butions are the ultimate focus of this sketch, the point of Uncle Sam's pride. The food bags symbolized two of the many war-era Scout projects that were described in organizational literature as conservation drives. Boy Scouts led the Liberty Gardens project to grow crops in vacant urban lots and abandoned fields. They helped recruit and supervise their mothers' adherence to Herbert Hoover's food conservation program that limited consumption in homes. Other popular Boy Scout war conservation drives included collecting rubber, newspapers, and scrap metal; stockpiling peach pits and nut shells for soldiers' gas masks; growing castor beans in waste places to make airplane motor oil; and</page><page sequence="11">622 | ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY 15 (OCTOBER 2010) Figure 4. Two Important Features of the Scout Camper's Equipment. The crux of this standoff was what purpose nature served in developing boys' characters. The grown-up Scout conservationist valued foresight, self-control, and civic responsibility over care free and selfish pioneering.

Admirers called Scout bond salesmen the "gleaners after the reapers" because they recanvassed areas already tapped by adults to eke out the remaining small contributions to the American war chest. In figure 3, Rigney equated tent caterpillar extermination-a widespread BSA conservation activity during the war and the 1920s -with a Scout's ability to eliminate the "propaganda," "lies," and "pessimistic rumors" spread by the German Kaiser's helmeted tent caterpillar infestation. Only the vigilant Boy Scout conservationist could protect the black walnut "U.S. Liberty Tree" (a leading victim of tent caterpillar defoliation), which grew strong in the soil of "Americanism." Boy Scouts across the country helped locate stands of black walnut trees for the military to use in manufacturing gun stocks and airplane propellers.13 Despite the growing emphasis on conservation, BSA administrators remained ambiguous on the use of axes and hesitated to expressly prohibit pio neering through the mid-i920s. They took more than a decade to implement Sudworth's reforms in Scout rank and badge tests. The 1921 sketch in figure 4, from Scouting magazine, captured the difficulty officials had in disso ciating the Boy Scout from the pioneer. Wearing Scout uniform shorts and hats,</page><page sequence="12">CONSERVATION OF BOYHOOD | 623 the smiling axe-Scout and matchstick-Scout pleaded that playing pioneer and building campfires was an integral and innocent part of the adolescent boy's camp experience. They seemed unaware of the selfish deforestation and waste ful forest fires left in their wake. American Scouts and their leaders resisted, for a time, the uniform shorts that European Scouts and leaders had adopted because they saw them as juvenile. The artist contrasted the axe- and matchstick-Scouts' shorts, spindly limbs, and casual posture with the Boy Scout's adult pants, muscular build, and erect stance-suggesting that protect ing forests from these juvenile "Engines of Destruction" was the duty of mature males. Paralleling the debate amongst BSA supporters-and G. Stanley Hall's child psychology theory that playing Indian and pioneer was a natural stage of development beyond which leading boys had to evolve-the clench-fisted Scout conservationist seemed ready to fight his childish inner demons for control over his own masculinity and environmental evolution.14 By the late 1920s, BSA sources stressed that pioneering was at odds with the needs of modern American society. In a new section on wildlife and forest con servation for the 1927 Boy Scout handbook revision, E. W. Nelson (chief of the United States Bureau of Biological Survey) explained that early pioneer settlers had encountered a land so abundant in natural resources that they regarded the forest "as an obstruction in the path of progress and [it] was cut and burned as rapidly as possible to make way for cultivated crops." He noted that this attitude had contributed to the destruction of much of the country's forests and wildlife, but that "enlightened public sentiment" was now working to conserve them for future generations. Nelson's explanation shifted the characterization of fron tier pioneering from Frederick Jackson Turner's crucible of American manhood and democracy to a recipe for environmental and national disaster. Continued national progress required future Boy Scout leaders to evolve beyond the vision of the individualistic pioneer to an enlightened and scientific concern for the greater good.15 Scout rank tests and merit badges reflected the shift away from pioneering activities and toward conservation principles. The original First Class Scout test required cutting down a tree or creating a significant piece of wood art. In 1928, the national Badges and Awards Committee began allowing boys the alternative of repairing a tree. That year's handbook told boys to plant seedlings in spots where they cut trees, even dead ones. A revised Camping merit badge pamphlet placed greater emphasis on conservation, stipulating the judicious use or even avoidance of axes. The pamphlet replaced the requirement to build a wooden shelter with setting up a reusable canvas tent. The author instructed boys to select naturally cleared spaces for pitching camp and to gather dead and downed wood for a small cooking fire instead of cutting down live trees for a large bonfire. Scout campers and hikers could now demonstrate a pioneer's viri lity and self-reliance while safeguarding the country's remaining forests and watersheds.16</page><page sequence="13">624 | ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY 15 (OCTOBER 2010) The critiques of early Boy Scouts' selfish attitude and environmental destruction suggested that unfettered pioneering uncomfortably blurred the distinction between native-born white civilized men, primitive preadolescents, and nonwhite savages. BSA officials discovered that conservation could teach boys masculine and environmental values that balanced pioneering's excesses. Natural resource conservation imbued members with self-control, civic leader ship, expert management, and scientific efficiency-values more conducive to leading modern society and its corporate industrial workforce. After more than a decade of inconsistent environmental messages, administrators settled on conservation activities and imagery as the primary way to socialize boys. Scout leaders partnered with government officials and conservation experts to simultaneously conserve forests and American boyhood.17 CONSERVING BOY SCOUT TREES AND FORESTS BSA leaders conflated the conservation of trees and boys because it conveyed the belief that expert management, structured outdoor activities, and conserva tion practice were needed to develop boys during what was seen in this era as the most volatile and vulnerable period of child development, adolescence. Supporters insisted that without a Scoutmaster's firm guidance, the nation's most important resource would go to waste as juvenile delinquents instead of maturing into America's future leaders. BSA administrators argued that adoles cent boys needed access to "Scout Forests" because they offered essential oppor tunities to learn the masculine values of both pioneering and conservation. A number of government officials and conservation supporters agreed that devel oping Boy Scouts' character and civic duty was an essential goal of natural resource conservation. Planting Scout Trees to memorialize heroes such as World War I soldiers and Theodore Roosevelt exemplified BSA forestry's combi nation of virility with scientific natural resource conservation and wise civic leadership. BSA publications argued that boy members should emulate the modest virtues of trees. Moreover, Scoutmasters should think like foresters in order to conserve the nation's key resource-boyhood. Scoutmaster Ralph Allen illus trated the twelve Boy Scout laws with reference to "A Tree as a Good Scout" in a 1922 article for Boys'Life (the magazine for boy members). An obedient tree did as it was told and worked in accordance with the rules decreed by established authority. A courteous tree behaved and did not intrude into the affairs of others. A trustworthy tree "faithfully stays in its place and does its work well." A loyal tree "is true to the laws of its nature. It does not play double." The clean tree "takes care of itself and cleans itself of worn out branches." An upright tree, like a reverent Scout, "constantly looks up at God and does not rebel." In a 1925 Scouting article entitled "Crooks: A Nature Study Article About Trees and Men, but Chiefly Men, Apropos of the Present Agitation About Crime and Its Prevention," the author compared proper boy rearing to</page><page sequence="14">CONSERVATION OF BOYHOOD | 625 a forester controlling the future shape of a tree. The essay explained how Scouting made boys more honest and educated and therefore less likely to sink into a life of crime. In listing key threats to the nation's boys, the author's first concern was that "[o]ne boy in four gets his American ideals in a foreign-born home.... So right here we have a fundamental truth about crooked trees and crooked men, THEY WERE NOT GIVEN THE RIGHT START IN LIFE." The metaphor suggested that Scoutmasters' expert, scientific man agement might prevent adolescent Scout Trees, particularly immigrant ones, from becoming juvenile delinquents.18 BSA sources insisted that the primary reason forests should be protected was to provide camp and work sites for Boy Scouts to learn pioneering's virile self-reliance, tempered with conservation's scientific efficiency, self control, and civic leadership. A 1925 article in The Scout Executive magazine (for local council administrators) reported "[a] great advance in the conserva tion of nature's most beautiful resources held in perpetuity for the boys of America. More important than saving forests for its products is saving the woods for our youth. We should quickly secure the beauty spots before they are gone." The author narrowed conservation's typical concern for the greater good to boys and their character development. The symbolic and physical iso lation of forest sites shielded adolescent boys from city rot, commercial leisure, and the heterosocial youth culture-forces which many native-born white Americans assumed would deform proper masculine and moral develop ment. BSA supporters referred to special forest areas set aside or planted for troop use as "Boy Scout Forests." BSA leaders encouraged local Scout councils that lacked access to existing woodlands to plant trees at their campsites or acquire their own forests, which many did. The organization's national Camping Department director, L. L. McDonald, pointed out in 1922 that "forest planting" Scout campsites would make them more valuable and attractive and would eventually provide shade and protection. More importantly, a small grove could furnish material for both pioneering and conservation. Figure 5 shows the Boy Scout Forest granted to a Madison troop by the University of Wisconsin in 1925. The university's Agricultural Department cooperated with a BSA commit tee in drawing up a ten-year plan including the construction of trails, camp grounds, and rustic bridges. The troop cleared forests and erected structures like pioneers while practicing conservation via reforestation, tree study, and scientific thinning of the forest.19 Key American government officials and conservation advocates reinforced BSA leaders' notion that forest conservation was essential for the masculine character and civic lessons it offered boys as much as for managing material resources. In 1911, BSA administrators rejected a proposal by Gifford Pinchot (former head of the U.S. Forest Service and a leading American advocate of con servation) to add a new Scout Law stressing the wise use of natural resources such as timber and water. What seemed to be missing from his suggested law was emphasis on training boys in good character and civic leadership.

Credit: New York Times (Sep. 6,1925): X18. editors published an essay by Pinchot the following year in Boys' Life that argued that Scout conservation lay at the very center of the nation and its citi zenship training project. Pinchot was named the BSA's Chief Scout Forester. Pinchot started a troop in his hometown and, as governor of Pennsylvania, helped recognize over thirty thousand Boy Scout Forest Guides for their conser vation contributions by 1925. The BSA received a ringing endorsement in 1926 from William B. Greeley, the third chief of the U.S. Forest Service. He promised the agency's support for Boy Scout conservation since "[wjoodcraft and the virtues that are bred in the forest-self-reliance, cool-headedness and resource fulness, close observation, love of and companionship with nature, hardiness, and simplicity-are a large part of what scouting aims to teach." He reported that many foresters first learned such manly virtues, outdoor living skills, and passion for the woods as Boy Scouts.20 Government officials throughout the country gave BSA troops special privi leges such as equipment, instruction, transportation, and land for conservation work. The federal government stamped its approval on this use of public resources when the presidents of the United States (starting with Taft) served as honorary presidents of the BSA and when Congress granted the BSA the nation's second-ever federal charter in 1916. Government officials often allowed Boy Scouts to use the public lands they helped conserve for hiking and building campsites. Government agencies granted Scouts semiofficial status, such as the 1915 "National Forest Aide" badge for Boy Scouts who ren dered at least ten days' service during the fire season. The BSA worked fervently to hold up its end of the bargain with the government. Scouts fought forest fires and served as park police-guarding prized tree groves and enforcing game con servation laws. Scouts helped with government fire-prevention campaigns and distributed forestry literature. Troops surveyed forests and planted trees in</page><page sequence="16">CONSERVATION OF BOYHOOD | 627 public parks and forests. By 1930, Boy Scouts were planting more than one million trees annually in cooperation with state and federal officials.21 Memorial Scout Tree planting emerged as a popular conservation activity because it helped connect members to virile American heroes while demonstrat ing Scouts' civic leadership and scientific management. BSA officials argued that the individual memorialized and the type and origin of the tree both reflected and influenced the character of the Scouts who planted it. During and after World War I, Boy Scouts across the country planted black walnut "Scout Trees" to honor America's fallen soldiers. These popular community cer emonies allowed Scouts to idealize war and soldiering without practicing the aggressive military drills for which the organization had been criticized by labor unions and women's clubs in the early 1910s. These events also paid tribute to Boy Scouts' own war conservation service of locating black walnut Liberty Trees for the military to harvest. The BSA exported its Scout Tree analogy by sending seeds to reforest French battlefields where American sol diers had fought.22 Theodore Roosevelt-the BSA's first and only "Chief Scout Citizen" and the best embodiment of Scouting's balanced masculine attributes, environmental activism, and civic leadership-rose to the top of the Scout Tree memorial list when he died in 1919. A 1926 Boys' Life article declared, "Scouting might have been modeled after his vigorous life and splendid character. He loved the open sky, he never tired of the rough trail. To his own boys he was what Scouting would call the ideal scoutmaster. His ideal of manhood was a character strong, rugged, resourceful. He was Scouting's one and only First Scout Citizen." Roosevelt mirrored Scouting's combination of virile individualism with self control, civic leadership, and progressive expertise. He had been a cowboy on his own western ranch and the head of the volunteer Rough Rider contingent in the Spanish-American War. As president, he enlisted expert bureaucrats to monitor the corporate trusts for the "greater good." Roosevelt tripled national forest holdings and advocated conservation methods such as land reclamation and leasing public land for efficient corporate exploitation. He also won the respect of preservationists and scientists by establishing more national parks and using the new Antiquities Act to set aside national monuments like the Petrified Forest and the Grand Canyon. Roosevelt was the BSA's most important public advocate in the 1910s. In return, Scouts and their tree memorials were key supporters of his manly legacy.23 Chief Scout Executive lames West declared that it was the duty of every American boy "who aspires to be a manly man" to plant and care for his own Roosevelt Memorial Tree so that the boy and the tree could mature together. The National Council instructed sixteen thousand troops to each plant a sturdy memorial tree with a bronze tablet to honor "the Great Scout." Troops around the country-inspired by large annual Scout pilgrimages led by Dan Beard and his contingent of buckskin-clad pioneer enthusiasts to Roosevelt's grave-planted seeds from the black walnut tree overhanging his final resting</page><page sequence="17">628 | ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY 15 (OCTOBER 2010) place. Beard argued that rugged native trees like oak and hickory could also be planted. He cooperated with Scientific American magazine to send Roosevelt walnuts to an English troop to honor the "brotherhood and fellowship of the American Scouts for their brother Scouts of England."24 BSA national leaders argued that conserving forests provided boy members with the best opportunity to learn balanced, modest manliness. Boys needed scientific, expert management in order to reach their full development and avoid juvenile delinquency. Planting and caring for Scout Tree memorials linked members to virile American heroes while reinforcing Boy Scouts' concern for the greater good and future generations. Commitment to natural resource conservation demonstrated Scouts' superior character and ability to lead the nation-state. Key government officials and conservationists agreed that teaching adolescent boys Scouting's modest manliness and civic leader ship was a crucial use of public lands and natural resources. SOCIAL HIERARCHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES The organization's adaptation of conservation to be its central masculine and environmental teaching concept helped solidify America's traditional gender, racial, and class hierarchy. BSA sources argued that the ability to conserve natural resources was a key indicator of balanced, modest manliness and suggested that such leading character traits were inherent to white, middle class males. Officials stated that black Americans and Native Americans, like young children, were too savage and selfish to be capable of deliberate natural resource conservation. The conservation of boyhood reinforced the belief that the working class lacked the intelligence and foresight needed to manage the nation's resources. Conservation's firm, scientific discrimination also distinguished Scouts from women, whom BSA leaders stereotyped as being too sentimental and selfish toward nature to conserve it properly.25 The BSA's emphasis on bird protection demonstrated how conserving natural resources could uphold a social hierarchy of character. In their support for the Migratory Bird Act and bird sanctuaries, Boy Scouts and their leaders prioritized elite sport hunting, bird watching, and farming over market and subsistence hunting. A 1913 Boys' Life article urged Scouts to get their fathers to write congressmen in support of the McLean Bill for federal pro tection of migratory birds. The author criticized how, despite robins' service to humans in eating hordes of crop-damaging insects, "we are right now, this very month, allowing the negroes and the poor whites of seven Southern states to slaughter the robins for the pot." The BSA's advocacy of bird conservation extended far beyond the successful McLean Bill. Scout troops policed and even created their own bird sanctuaries, reporting violations of game laws to authorities. National Scout Commissioner Dan Beard lamented in 1916 that native birds had been pushed to extinction because "our dear mammas, our lovely sisters, and our darling sweethearts and wives wanted the beautifully</page><page sequence="18">CONSERVATION OF BOYHOOD | 629 upholstered skins of these poor birds as ornaments for their hats." He con trasted women's superficial fashion urges with Boy Scouts' wise protection of endangered native birds. Beard ignored middle-class and elite women's demon stration of self-control and conservation during a successful boycott of the millinery trade from the 1890s to the 1910s.26 BSA literature claimed that white men's advanced character enabled and prompted them to protect the nation's natural resources. In a revised 1914 Boy Scout handbook, U.S. Forest Service dendrologist George Sudworth com pared white western ranchers' intentional burning of public forests to create grazing land with Native American hunters' practice of burning forests to scare out game. He stated that both groups were equally to blame for selfishly killing millions of trees. Ranchers, however, were also guilty of what might be termed environmental treason to the white race: "Wanton destruction of this sort is excusable in the case of Indians, because they were uncivilized and thought only of their own immediate needs. But in the case of white people such useless waste of what, in most cases, did not belong to them, is criminal-uncivilized." In his description of the extraction of turpentine and resin from longleaf pines in the section on tree identification, Sudworth implied that the role of blacks in forestry was limited to manual labor: "Negro laborers gather the resin and transport it to the 'still,' as they call it, where it is distilled." This passage is significant because it was one of the only references to blacks outdoors in early BSA publications besides primitive Africans in safari tales. In this 1914 handbook's new section on "Conservation of Wild Life and Forests," William T. Hornaday cast civilization as nature's main enemy but maintained that deliberate conservation was exclusively a white man's trait: "The natural tendency of civilization is to destroy the pro ducts and the choicest handiwork of nature. Civilized man exterminates whole species of wild birds, beasts, and fishes as no savages have dreamed of doing." Hornaday, a prominent advocate of wildlife protection and director of the world-leading Bronx Zoo, singled out reckless game hunters and people who started forest fires as the primary culprits in civilization's "Army of Destruction." While the passage hinted that primitive nonwhites might serve as a model for a broader and more inclusive Scout environmental and social philosophy, he posited the intentional conservation of remaining wild life and forests as a "white man's burden" that Boy Scouts "should manfully take up."27 BSA sources criticized working-class boys for being too selfish, ignorant, and short-sighted to live up to conservation's standards of sustained develop ment and responsibility to the nation and future generations. The working-class street "Tough" was a stock character of early Scout plays and stories. The Tough exhibited aggressive virility like a pioneer, but his impoverished background hinted at delinquent tendencies arising from an ingrained lack of self-control. A1929 play written by a boy member for Scout Executive magazine centered on a conversation between an Eagle Scout-the BSA's highest boy rank-and a</page><page sequence="19">630 | ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY 15 (OCTOBER 2010) Tough with a heavy accent, poor grammar, and "several front teeth missing." The Tough reported that he spent his free time "smokin' cigarettes, ridin' box cars and shootin' birds. Shot a robin and a canary this morning." The Tough asked the Eagle Scout how many birds he had to shoot in order to earn the Marksmanship merit badge on his uniform. The Scout retorted that the badge judged accuracy and consistency in shooting inanimate targets since "[o]ne of the first things a Scout pledges is not to kill harmless creatures for the mere pleasure of killing." The play hinted that savage treatment of innocent birds revealed further character shortcomings. The Tough's inquiry about other merit badges gave the Eagle Scout a chance to lecture him on safety, nutrition, hygiene, and school study habits.28 BSA leaders suggested that women were too self-involved and sentimental to conserve resources, while Scouting developed the firm reason and scientific judgment boys needed to distinguish between species such as native birds and trees that deserved kind protection and pests such as mosquitoes and tree caterpillars that conflicted with human interests and needed to be elimi nated. The Sixth Scout Law, inherited from the original British Boy Scout program, instructed boys to be kind to animals and help protect them. Dan Beard and other BSA leaders, however, feared that being kind to all animals and insects was a feminine liability and a threat to natural resource manage ment. Beard clarified the American Sixth Scout Law in 1917, "A Scout is kind, but that does not mean that he will not kill [creatures that] are enemies to the plants." He argued that being kind to harmful animals and insects was "slushy sentimentalism, which is neither the pure water of truth and kindness nor the hard cold ice of decision. A Scout is kind, he is kind but firm." A World War I Scouting article-entitled "Shall We Have Hun Scoutmasters?"-argued that since Scouts were not supposed to be kind to harmful rats and rattlesnakes, they did not have to befriend the country's enemies, who murdered women and children. The author instructed local officials to expel German-American Scoutmasters, who were probably manipulating boy members into sabotaging the war effort. Some local councils complied. As the figure 6 sketch in the New York Times suggested, government officials frequently sought and received Boy Scouts' aid on a wide range of natural resource protection and pest exter mination projects, especially when there was insufficient funding to pay men to do the tasks.29 BSA leaders equated being kind to "dumb," "weak," and female animals and being firm against noxious pests with chivalry, linking animal conservation with Boy Scouts' provision of service to "helpless" women, the poor, and inva lids. Arthur Carey, the first director of the BSA's Sea Scout branch for older teen agers, argued that a key part of a medieval knight's chivalric duty was "to bring order out of confusion-to kill the wild beasts that interfered with flocks and herds and made farming difficult." He compared the extermination of savage predators to a knight's duty to overpower the highwaymen and robbers who made traveling unsafe for women and children: "It goes without saying that</page><page sequence="20">CONSERVATION OF BOYHOOD | 631 Figure 6. Untitled Sketch. Exterminating animals and insects considered to be pests to humans was as central to Boy Scout conservation and character lessons as was protecting more valued species. Credit: New York Times (June 1, 1924): X10. dangerous or noxious animals should be killed ... by killing them we are really protecting far more life, and life of a higher order, than we destroy. The motive of the killing is really constructive or upbuilding." Carey differentiated con scientious pest extermination from a young boy killing harmless squirrels or songbirds, a primitive instinct which a mature Scout sublimated. Being firm with pests paralleled the National Park and Forest Services' widening predator extermination campaigns in this era, but the BSA stressed building members' firm character and civic leadership.30 Theodore Roosevelt and prominent naturalist John Burroughs had accused Ernest Thompson Seton (the BSA's initial Chief Scout and Indian lore expert) and other writers of sentimental anthropomorphic tales of being feminine "Nature Fakers," but William T. Hornaday enlisted anthropomorphism to serve "hard" Scout conservation and boy character building. Hornaday, who established the Permanent Wildlife Protection Fund and the BSA's wildlife con servation medal, employed modest manliness to justify Scouts hunting certain animals for their furs or to protect more valuable natural resources. He argued in the 1914 Boy Scout handbook revision that pumas were destructive to cattle and sheep, as well as not "courageous," so boys could fulfill their duty to protect valuable livestock by hunting them. Weasels' and minks' savage and wasteful desire to kill more birds than they could eat made trapping them "chivalric." The woodchuck was a fair target because he destroyed gardens and was fat, unsocial, and "anarchistic." The beaver was a more complex case. Hornaday told Scouts that they could learn balanced manliness by colonizing and observ ing the gallant, wise, and industrious beaver; but he insisted that killing "excess" beavers for their fur was "a perfectly legitimate industry."31 In a 1918 Boys' Life article on "The Ethics of Trapping," though, Hornaday seemed caught between a man's conflicting duties to experience pioneer viri lity, protect productive natural resources from pests, and avoid savage cruelty to animals. He confessed that the "steel trap is admittedly a cruel method," but argued that no other way of exterminating pests was practical. The article warned boys that trapping as a career was difficult; however, it contained</page><page sequence="21">632 | ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY 15 (OCTOBER 2010) a subtle undertone of wishful praise for men living far from others in a log cabin, not bathing, and risking death in a battle against the elements. After jus tifying trapping and noting the manly benefits of the trapper's life, Hornaday oddly concluded, "In fact, how can any scout become a professional steel-trap trapper and live up to the Boy Scout Law [on kindness to animals]?"32 Animal welfare advocates used this tension in Scout masculine ideology to challenge the organization's support of animal trapping. In response to trap ping essays and advertisements in Boys' Life, prominent stage actress Minnie Maddern Fiske wrote a letter in 1920 to the New York Times demanding that Boy Scouts live up to the Sixth Scout Law's "manly promises to 'be kind'" to animals and end "the barbarism of trapping." She argued that trapping animals for furs would not only lead to their extinction, but also encourage boys to torture animals like savages instead of learning the humane self-control that was supposed to distinguish Anglo-Saxon men. She attempted to counter the virility of hunting and trapping with the ideal of men's chivalric protection of the weak. Fiske argued that if the Boy Scouts refused to comply, then ladies could band together to boycott the purchase of fur clothing and put an end to the trapping business themselves. An article pub lished the following month in The Literary Digest sought to undercut potential gendered critiques of Fiske's letter, insisting that she was "basing her opinion not upon [feminine] sentiment, but upon the fact that she has been 'in close touch with trappers and with the [masculine] business of trapping for twenty years.'" Playing on the Scout concept that a boy's attitude toward nature reflected his broader character, the author warned that a Scout's breach of the requirement to be kind to animals might lead to other infractions of his manly duties.33 BSA national administrators responded with a modernized defense of trap ping by using natural resource conservation to reframe the masculine duties of self-control and protecting the weak. They argued that a Scout's primary respon sibility was to protect human crops and livestock from horrible pests that fed on them and that animal trapping was the most efficient, practical way of doing that. Since the Sixth Scout Law only protected harmless life, destructive animals such as wolves or weasels should still be trapped by boys. Visiting the traps daily and not torturing animals distinguished humane Scout conser vation from environmental savagery. This was still a difficult line to tread, so BSA administrators quietly decided to refuse trapping ads in future issues of Boys' Life. The author of a 1923 Boys' Life article rejected the suggestion in a popular New York play that Scouts were kind to all animals: "[The playwright] was wrong. Scouts kill things that are only harmful. Destructive pests ... should learn to fear the Boy Scouts." The BSA national office published an American Humane Association leaflet on the barbarism of animal furs and trapping in 1930, but lodged it at the end of the Taxidermy merit badge pamphlet. Despite the author's instruction that Scouts should only practice taxidermy on harmful pests, dead family pets, or poultry headed to the dinner table, the</page><page sequence="22">CONSERVATION OF BOYHOOD | 633 pamphlet could not entirely mask the tensions still contained in the BSA's gen dered nature policies.34 BSA administrators and local leaders relied on natural resource conserva tion activities and symbolism to distinguish between the character and citizen ship capabilities of women and men, as well as different racial and class groups of men. The organization attracted broad government and popular support by promising to develop boys' balanced, modest manliness and leading citizenship through safeguarding the nation's natural resources. BSA leaders' employment of natural resource conservation to modernize Victorians' and psychologists' theories of conserving boyhood provided an effective solution to the selfish waste and inefficiency associated with playing pioneer or Indian. Primitive out doorsmanship and wilderness preservation offered temporary escapes from modernity rather than a way of engaging it effectively. By teaching members scientific efficiency, self-control, and expert management, Scouting's conserva tion of boyhood helped native-born white, middle-class men and boys maintain their dominance over an industrializing and urbanizing society and its pro gressive government. The simultaneous conservation of boyhood and natural resources was central to the dramatic growth and longevity of the BSA. Boy Scouting helped popularize natural resource conservation between 1914 and 1932, a period which many environmental historians have mistakenly character ized as the Dark Age of layperson activism and the end of cooperation between men and women environmentalists on concerns about morality and childhood.

The BSA's first merit badge options in 1911 included Conservation and Forestry, but relatively few Scouts earned these badges in the 1910s. More Scouts earned the Pioneering, Pathfinding, and Camping badges in the 1910s. The BSA did not offer an Indian Lore badge until 1931. BSA national leaders' rhetoric and imagery initially empha sized conservation less than playing pioneer and Indian, but this was soon reversed.

This critique of pioneering also came from inside the organization. Joseph Carstang complained at a 1917 Scoutmasters' Conference that boys at the national Scout demonstration camp at Palisades Interstate Park hacked trees with axes too often: "I think the Scouting Axe is the most misused thing we have got. I have done more camping without an axe than with one. I think when these Scouts are taught that they can do without an axe" ("Hiking and Trekking" discus sion group, transcript of 1917 Scoutmasters' training conference [Columbia University: Feb. 2, 1917], hand-numbered p. 284, BSA National Archive, Irving, Texas). A BSA staff writer cautioned boy readers, "[L]et's watch those scouts who are occasionally careless with their axes. If we see a fellow 'pulling the George Washington stunt,' let's take the trouble to explain the evils of tree-damaging to him so effectively that he will never forget them" (The Cave Scout, "Trees and Fighting," Boys' Life [Sep. 1915]: 13).

See 1927 BSA Annual Report, 134; and Oursler, Boy Scout Story, 86-87.

In one of countless examples of tent caterpillar extermination, the 1928 Annual Report noted in a "protection of wild life" section that Kansas City Boy Scouts burned 2.5 million bag worms which threatened the trees and foliage. 1928 BSA Annual Report, 136. One 1918 Scouting article referred to weeds in Scout Liberty Gardens as the "enemy in our Midst... Every weed is a friend of the 'Hun' and by pulling it you will be doing something toward gaining the victory over the enemies of Liberty" (Scouting [May 1,1918]: 8). 14.

II, 136-38,149. 20. Pinchot, Theodore Roosevelt, Ernest Thompson Seton, and later West were the only four men with Chief Scout titles in the BSA. Pinchot offered the following versions of his proposed conservation law: "A Boy Scout wastes nothing, but makes the best use of all he has"; "A Boy Scout tries to leave the place where he has lived better than he found it"; and "A Boy Scout knows the Nation will continue after he is dead, and tries to stop the waste of natural resources."

The theory of human relations that most closely resembled conservation was neither democracy nor egalitarianism, but rather eugenics. In large part, eugenics was natural resource conservation and animal breeding concepts applied to human society. BSA national leaders, however, did not expressly advocate eugenics. 26.

On the convergence of diverse groups on protecting birds, see Lisa Mighetto, Wild Animals and American Environmental Ethics (Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 1991). A number of prominent reform women joined the Audubon Society's crusade to stop the use of wild bird feathers in women's fashion. Women's support-combined with that of politicians, student groups parti cipating in "Bird Day," and natural scientists such as John Burroughs and George Bird Grinnell-achieved the proscription of feather imports in the Underwood Tariff of 1913.

Even some women found that dis tinguishing between manly and feminine behaviors was often the most effective vehicle for teaching boys wildlife conservation ideologies. Clara B. Ward praised the BSA for teaching local boys to study and protect birds instead of shooting them with air-guns. Ward noted that she had previously tried to teach the boys to follow these practices herself, but the boys had refused because she " 'looked at things as girls did,' and boys at their age do not want to be 'girlish'" (Ward's letter excerpted in "Interest in Birds," 1913 BSA Annual Report, 35). 27. Handbook for Boys (1919): quotations on 165, 170-71, 227-28 (the 1919 printing's wording was first used in the 1914 revision). The next major handbook revision elimi nated most of Sudworth's racialized remarks about forestry behavior. Handbook for Boys (1928), 283-329. The 1930 BSA Textiles merit badge pamphlet made a similar argument about black environmental roles, "The negroes of the South have learned better than any other class of people how to pick cotton, and they enjoy it" because they hold work competitions and sing while they work ("Picking of Cotton," Textiles [New York: BSA, 1930], 25). See also black orange pickers in Citrus Fruit Culture merit badge pamphlet (New York: BSA, 1931), 60. Hornaday was once a big-game hunter and leading taxidermist. In his other writings, he explained that the rare, true gentleman sportshunter shot only a few animals for the experience of the hunt and only those that were in abundance. The game hog, regardless of whether a sport or subsistence hunter, shot the full legal limit of game and more, even when a species was endangered. He cited women who wanted to wear furs and feathers as contributors to over-hunting. See William T.
