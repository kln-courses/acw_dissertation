BERNSTEIN ERREGTE GESELLSCHAFT: PHILOSOPHIE DER SENSATION [EXCITED SOCIETY: PHILOSOPHY OF SENSATION] BY CHRISTOPH TORCKE KRITIK DER ETHISCHEN GEWALT [CRITIQUE OF ETHICAL VIOLENCE] BY JUDITH BUTLER Faio A9 lud I I. Time is a constitutive factor in the unfolding of any strong form of thought. The idea, so dear to Adorno, that the history outside an artwork, responsible for its aging, is also part of its own truth con- tent should be adopted in the evaluation of his philosophy as well. Its actuality depends on the confrontation with two attitudes, at bottom complementary. For were it to be relegated to the hall of cultural monuments, newly encouraged in his centennial by the ide- ological representation of Adorno as wunderkind, or unreflectively dismissed as outdated, as in the perennial reproaches of elitism or pessimism, it would surely be fated to be eventually forgotten. The three books discussed below prove otherwise; though different in their relationship with Adorno's work, they engage with it, generat- ing fruitful areas of tension and disagreement. Their involvement with Adorno's texts is here presented in decreasing levels of inten- sity-starting with an academic adaptation, through creative appro- priation, and ending with an institutional dialogue-yet, in all of them, strong moments are to be found intertwined with frustrating limitations. These, their shortcomings, hesitations, or blind spots, must not be taken as sheer deficiencies but rather, in an Adornean fashion, as negatives shaped by their own success. They should be considered, in other words, as invitations to future works.

Leaving aside the now perhaps hegemonic posi- tion in German studies, which in the wake of Habermas and Wellmer approaches Adorno as a mere straw man against which the project of a communicative theory of action can be spelled out, one can mention the valuable work of such authors as Martin Jay, Susan Buck-Morss, Fredric Jameson, Shierry Weber Nicholsen, Thomas Huhn, Lambert Zuidervaart, and Robert Hullot-Kentor, who have devel- oped Adornean concepts, themes, and articulations in a number of rhetorical modes that range from sheer "objective" explanations and paraphrases to innovative creative appropriations. J. M. Bernstein's Adorno: Disenchantment and Ethics starts a new and important chap- ter in the ongoing history of the reception of the Frankfurt School at the center of capitalism. For the first time Adorno's work is interpreted as a coherent whole from the point of view of Anglo- American "hard" philosophy, and on thoroughly sympathetic terms. In its fascinating work of faithful systematic reconstitution, Bern- stein's text is best approached as a unique instance of geographical- intellectual translation. Adorno: Disenchantment and Ethics can be described as a sus- tained and breathtakingly structured argument that, starting from Weber's theory of the disenchantment of the world, slowly lays the foundations for the definition of the concept of "ethical modernism," Bernstein's own positive contribution to the contemporary debate on ethics. The path leading to such a concept engages Adornean arguments in dialogues with an astonishing number of philosophical stances, including Kant and Kantians, Hegel and Hegelians, Heideg- ger, analytical philosophers, Habermas, and diverse contemporary theories of morality and ethics. This kind of comprehensiveness and breadth is already in and by itself a characteristic feature of the American academy, which in its best moments manages to concili- ate very delimited fields of inquiry with a dizzying work of foot- noting and cross-referencing. The amazing bibliographical scope, however, is not enough to shun a certain Anglophonic provincial- ism, another trait of much of American philosophy, as expressed in</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 263 Adorno: Disenchantment and Ethics by the virtual absence of any ref- erence to nontranslated foreign works, especially those dealing with Adorno's ethics.' Finally, it is worth pointing out another apparently typical trademark of Anglo-American philosophical practice, namely the quasi-obsessive argumentative nature of Bernstein's method of exposition, which interestingly enough involves, apart from a cer- tain stylistic sloppiness, strategies in sharp contrast to Adorno's expressive writing. These include frequent analytical dissection of passages into listings of propositions, implicit evaluative judgments (e.g. about Dialectic of Enlightenment: "argumentatively, this is a mess" [1661 or "Horkheimer and Adorno tend to present their position in these unsatisfactory terms" [278]), and the original practice, albeit sometimes questionable, of inserting bracketed elucidative com- ments inside quotations from Adorno. Bernstein's argument may be summarized in three steps. The first concerns the claim that the process of rationalization and dis- enchantment as described by Weber permeates the whole of social and private life. As is well known, this theoretical framework ac- counts for a dynamic whereby the world becomes ever more ruled by the impersonal calculability of scientific and bureaucratic reason, which deprives it of its qualitative aspects, thus leading to the for- mation of the famous "iron cage" of reason. What is remarkable in Bernstein's account, however, is the relentless manner in which he employs Weber's theory to defend a strong concept of totality, a daring position in the current American intellectual scene, which so easily welcomes the so-called death of the great master narratives and so systematically avoids any vision of the whole. In convinc- ingly argued pages Bernstein elucidates ideas in Minima Moralia so as to show that "wrong life cannot be lived rightly." This is achieved in micrological explanations of the internal contradictions embed- ded in the bourgeois ideals of love, marriage, and home (aphorisms 110, 10 and 111, and 18, respectively), three touchstones for any con- temporary version of what the good life might be. The former is caught between the irreconcilable impulses of spontaneity and fidelity and their ideological projections. Spontaneity, implying the surrendering of the will and the dissolution of the means-end logic underlying the work process, becomes its opposite as soon as it is established as a social rule of behavior, whereas fidelity, so much</page><page sequence="4">264 I BOOK REVIEWS akin to possession and self-preservation, may offer the integrity needed against the consumerist version of passion. Likewise, mar- riage is caught between the poles of the refuge from relations of self-interest and the inequalities underlying it as an institution, so evident in male domination of female domestic labor. As for home, it can only exist as a concept in the tension between the unlivable standardized dwellings of the present and the impossible, anyway unrealizable and false, desire for the coziness and sheltering of non- rationalized, albeit nonfunctional, houses of the past. Bernstein's conclusion is in perfect consonance with Adorno and deserves to be quoted in its entirety: If his analyses are true, then there is no morally correct way of acting, even in the intimate sphere, except a suspended one that refuses to claim legitimacy for itself beyond its unwillingness to settle for the moral choices on offer; the moral choices on offer are themselves "im- moral," not consonant with what we take morality to be. And to the degree to which this is the case, to the degree to which we can be nei- ther good wills nor utility maximisers nor concretely envision the con- fluence of these two moralities in a new or renewed virtue ethics with its caring voice, then the very idea of morality evades us. By taking a suspended, aporetic stance we affirm the possibility of ethical life by denying its present, empirical and conceptual embodiments. (56-57) Once the idea of the untrue whole is established, Bernstein can proceed to the second part of his argument, namely the conceptual working of disenchantment. He begins with a characterization of the historical process of disenchantment as dealt with by Adorno and Horkheimer in Dialectic of Enlightenment. The contents of his ex- position are not altogether new; what is noteworthy, rather, is the analytical form taken by Bernstein's exposition, an interesting case of philosophical translation. The famous intertwining of reason and myth is here read as the ever deeper work of conceptual subsump- tion under ever more universal and abstract categories, thus gener- ating what Bernstein calls "the principle of immanence," his version of Adorno's identity thinking. Such a principle, already to be found in myth, involves a work of classification, explanation, and deduc- tion that detaches things from their context of existence and from the impact they may exercise upon subjects-their aura; likewise, in enlightening progress, whatever does not conform to homogenizing</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 265 logical principles, whatever is qualitatively different, is explained away as anthropomorphic projections originating in fear. In this way, immanence becomes "platitudinous" because by disregarding what is qualitatively specific about individual objects of cognition it can only offer reiterability and instrumentality in return, thus finally being left only with itself as its own object: the culmination of dis- enchantment as the utter rationalization of reason. Bernstein's innovative insight was to characterize this well- known process as relating to the workings of the "simple concept," conceived as "historically defined with Kant's dichotomy between concepts and intuitions: intuitions without concepts are blind, and thought, concepts, without intuitions are empty" (221). In a detailed analysis of Kant's pure and practical reason, Bernstein advances the important claim that intuitions are not spontaneous or natural ele- ments in cognition but already correspond to the rationalization and taming of mimetic impulses. Their repression generates coldness and detachment as the main subjective by-product, the fundamen- tal prerequisite for the destruction of the concept of humanity, of which Auschwitz was the ultimate case. In short, The ideal of the simple concept is formed from what will satisfy the need to avoid affective contamination as the general conception of an- thropomorphic projection. Three ideals capture this ideal of indepen- dence: (1) truth should be "imageless," unmarked by the subjective perspective; (2) vertically, the more general a concept is the more ratio- nal it is; (3) horizontally, the meaning of a concept should be indepen- dent of, its sense insulated from, its application to future cases. (222) In opposition to this, Bernstein argues in favor of what he calls "complex concept," a cognitive tool that does not move away from the singularity of the object, which endows it with an aura and is open to a mimetic comportment. Of course, the main reference here is Adorno's ideal of the primacy of the object as developed in Neg- ative Dialectics, of which Bernstein appropriately reminds us that it corresponds to an axial turn in the Kantian-Copernican revolution: not how objects enter our cognitive apparatus but what is left behind in the process. What is surprising, however, is that Bernstein has a precise logical category to account for this care for the object, namely, that of "material inference." Radically opposed to enthymemes,</page><page sequence="6">266 BOOK REVIEWS which lack a general rule in their structure of reasoning, material inferences are processes of thought in which "the universal is real- ized only through the particular that exemplifies it; and the partic- ular appears only as determined, thus universal" (265). Thus, in Bernstein's example, the proposition "he is bleeding badly" would have as its material inference "I'll apply a tourniquet." It is not the case that the action to be performed comes from a general rule (i.e. all people bleeding should have a tourniquet applied to them) but rather that it comes into being as an impulse of anthropomorphic identification, an experience of the immediate suffering of someone in front of you. This mixture of cognition and action is thus related to an intransitive idea of knowledge, which refuses to turn the mat- ter at hand into an instrument for any kind of end. The complex concept, then, can be characterized by the dialec- tical relationship of both dependence and autonomy between its two axes. The logical one concerns the process of abstraction, deduc- tion, and universalist ascent described above; the expressive axis, on the other hand, corresponds to the movement toward the object, which Bernstein characterizes as an attempt to name it. Grounding this impulse is a very well-articulated theory of affinity, which "rep- resents the indeterminate idea of our immersion in and being parts of nature, ontologically and epistemologically. In this respect, it is what identity thinking can be conceived as recoiling from; affinity is a counter-image to anthropomorphism as a structure of projec- tive illusion" (291). After the definition of the complex concept as the combination, not without tension, of mimesis and rationality, the third argumen- tative step is reached with the idea of "ethical modernism," which defines the conditions of possibility in the present for the practice of acts of material inference. As could be expected, in a completely rationalized and disenchanted world, guiding rules for moral action are an impossibility-they should rather be read as symptoms of the problem rather than its solution. Moral deeds inhabit instead what Bernstein calls "fugitive" occurrences, unplanned and unfore- seen flimsy moments when, confronted with an unexpected claim from the other, one brings about an action of help without volition or intention. In this Bernstein sees a correlate to a metaphysical experience, an instance of fleeting transcendence, a faint promise of</page><page sequence="7">BOOK REVIEWS 267 reconciliation in the midst of a totality pervaded by identity think- ing. And if this ethics can be termed "modernist" it is because it mirrors aesthetics insofar as the latter "attempts the rescue of sem- blance . . . to demonstrate how art works as semblances can reveal the possibility of a transfigured nature" (435). To be sure, in its brevity and reductiveness this summary fails to do justice to many nuances and ramifications of Adorno: Disen- chantment and Ethics (in particular the beautiful pages on Adorno's naturalism and his depiction of death, in opposition to Heidegger's). But it should be complete enough to attest one central, indeed sys- tematic, absence in Bernstein's argument: the commodity form. Tak- ing his clue from Lukacs's History and Class Consciousness, Adorno very clearly and repeatedly stressed the parallelism between the commodity and the (simple) concept as embodying the same under- lying identifying logic-see in this respect chapter 1 of Capital, for example Marx's definition of money as the universal equivalent. Bernstein's justification for disregarding Lukhcs comes only in a footnote (the place into which things Marxist are repressed), ironi- cally enough, in a bad piece of reasoning: My emphasis here and throughout on Weber may, if one wishes, be taken as a simplifying, heuristic device. In providing this emphasis I do not mean to deny the importance of, above all, volume 1 of Marx's Capital on Adorno. But since Adorno's appropriation of Marx tends to be through the Weberian reading of Capital provided by Georg Lukics's History and Class Consciousness and his own position seems to develop more out of Weber's than Marx's, there is at least a prima facie case for seeing this emphasis as non-distorting. (7n) The fact that Lukacs articulates Weber and Marx is not a reason to forget the latter, nor are "seem," "at least," and "prima facie" words strong enough to justify the purging of a whole Marxist her- itage present in Adorno and amply attested by a great number of commentators. As a work of theoretical translation, then, Adorno: Disenchant- ment and Ethics is a paradoxical achievement. On the one hand, it manages to firmly and strongly adapt Adorno to the bibliographical references and the argumentative practices (in short, the rules of the philosophical game) in the United States. It thus makes Adorno a</page><page sequence="8">268 I BOOK REVIEWS respectable voice in the American philosophical establishment. On the other hand, however, this happens through the utter elimina- tion of all social content in Adorno, the oblivion of a rich and com- plex, even if at times contradictory, Marxist tradition. The question thus remains whether this paradox is a necessary one, whether insti- tutionalized, mainstream American philosophy can only exist as a philosophy purged of its desire to become something else. ABSOLUTE GENEALOGY OF THE SENSATIONAL Christoph Tiircke's Erregte Gesellschaft: Philosophie der Sensation [Ex- cited Society: Philosophy of Sensation] (2002) is in many respects the opposite of Bernstein's book. An amazing work of philosophi- cal research, it does what academic publications in general are only rarely willing to: it dares. The text is divided into five parts, and its argumentative structure very much resembles that of Dialectic of Enlightenment. Indeed, one could characterize the two books (to- gether, probably, with Giorgio Agamben's Homo Sacer) as works of "absolute genealogy," intellectual endeavors that probe so deep into a given phenomenon that they ultimately question the possibilities of phenomenality as such. This is an inherently dangerous form of inquiry, because by encompassing everything, by interlacing what is most archaic and distant with what is most contemporaneous, it tends not to leave any room for the reader's reaction, save either that of desperation, which may at times be productive, or indiffer- ence, which never is. Tiircke starts with a state of affairs Adorno and Horkheimer could not have foreseen: the emergence of a digitalized, post-Cold War world where capitalist competition seems to gain new momen- tum-quite at odds with the Frankfurt School's early diagnosis of a completely monopolized system in which competition would be but an ideological shell. In the age of computer technology and the proliferation of the media, those who do not take part in the pro- duction and circulation of signs do not exist; the fundamental for- mula for this is esse est percipii (being is being seen). In a context where socialization happens through the commodity form (e.g. the logo as a fundamental element in the definition of one's identity),</page><page sequence="9">BOOK REVIEWS 269 existence becomes tantamount to emitting signs, strangely depriv- ing outsiders (either individuals or whole continents, such as Africa) of a feeling of Dasein. And if signs can only work as such by means of sensory stimulation, then perception acquires an unexpectedly central social relevance: Sensation is a whole complex of things. First of all, something subjec- tive: perception; then, its intensification: perception of the sensational; then, something objective: the sensational itself; and finally, the inter- penetration and strengthening of what is subjective and objective. Both are moments of an all-encompassing compulsion to emit signs, a com- pulsion that makes sure that the economic struggle for the "being-there" [Kampf ums Dasein] becomes ever more aestheticized as one over per- ception, at the same time that the "sensational" [das Aufsehenerregende] becomes the primary meaning of what is perceived by the senses [Sen- sation]. Perception of the sensational turns into perception itself. (77) There are two important consequences springing from this state of affairs. In the first place, anesthesia, numbness occasioned by an overflow of messages, becomes a constant threat and something to be fiercely combated by the culture industry; second, a structural feeling of placelessness starts to take shape. Since there is no longer any "there" that could be taken for granted, the world loses any point of reference that might give it a center. In a typically daring argu- mentative move, Tiircke posits that it was only with the microelec- tronic revolution that the Copernican one could finally be fulfilled. This will constitute the core of the dialectic of the sacred to be pursued later on. But before dwelling on that, in order to give more credibility to an otherwise almost unbelievable reversal, Tuircke devotes some very interesting pages to the philosophical etymology of sensatio. Here we are shown how the taste for rarities was devel- oped in the Middle Ages, thus blurring the line separating studiosi- tas (a virtue) from curiositas (a vice). Collections of rare specimens, generally related to far-off trade and as a rule exposed in the mar- ketplace, gave the impression that nature contained an inexhaustible potential for the strange and the exotic. It is precisely the market- place that works as a transition to modern times with the emer- gence of the press as the main early instrument for the continuous excitement of sensory organs.</page><page sequence="10">270 I BOOK REVIEWS This stepping back in time is important to introduce the third and central chapter of the book, indeed its most audacious one, called "Physio-Theology of Sensation." A philosophical-neurological enquiry, it lays the ground for the ground-zero argumentative layer of Excited Society, which parallels that of the Dialectic of Enlightenment, the primeval experience of terror before the unknown.2 "Sacred" is the word that, according to Tiircke, describes the cunning of theo- logical reason, which ascribes a positive value to what presented itself as most threatening and destructive. The handling of original horror is here described with the help of neurology. If conscious- ness, thoughts, and concepts are but "crusts," "burnt-out" drives, feelings, and desires; if memory "does not involve any content what- soever, as for instance an image or a smell imprinted on it, but is only a certain neural combination, a net formed by a the channeling up of excitement" (128)-then the primordial, presubjective en- counter with the menacing other may be reinterpreted as an abso- lute shock that will demand the development of such strategies of defense as attention/concentration, verbalization, ecstasy, or mime- sis. Thus, the Aristotelian category of the tode ti becomes a sign of terror, for it is not a name proper, but rather the formula comprising the secret of naming. For names were originally articulated interjections: demon- stratives.... They did not express, in the beginning, what is, but what overwhelms. Their ex-pression [Ausdriicken] was originally a pressing away [Wegdriicken]. They do not emerge as identification with the object, but as acoustic defense against horror. (161) It is no wonder, then, that in this theoretical framework the sacred is regarded as the first attempt to master the experience of original shock, the first profane act. Its aim is, neurophysiologically speak- ing, the absorption of all disturbing excitement, which, if perfectly accomplished, would lead to the totally profane. This dialectic announces a bold reversal, in which the latest developments in dig- ital technology revert into what is most archaic. Through the audio- visual shock, two extreme points in human history are connected, for what Tiircke has been all the time aiming at is the intertwine- ment of two situations where no "there" can be found, no center identified.</page><page sequence="11">BOOK REVIEWS 271 The fourth chapter of the book, "Absolute Sensation" develops this from a different perspective. If in the previous part the main references, of course, were Nietzsche and Freud, here Tiircke intro- duces Marx and the Marxist tradition of Benjamin, Sohn-Rethel, and Adorno. Sensation now is related to mechanization, and, as always, illuminating insights abound: photography as the freezing up of the mysterium tremendum, as the nineteenth form of incarnation; the pic- ture as a monad and its shooting as a miniature of the industrial revolution; the principle of exchange [Tauschprinzip] and sacrifice, so central to Dialectic of Enlightenment, as means to achieve neuro- logical equilibrium; primitive accumulation as originating in the appropriation by priests of ritual offerings. With this, a dialectics of market and temple is proposed, thus mirroring that of the sacred and profane, in which the market is regarded as "a sedimentation of cult: its 'burnt-out,' protective outer layer as it were" (216). When the market totally replaces the church, the placelessness it creates reverts into the religious, inasmuch as its mechanism of selection becomes opaque, a matter not of personal virtue but of being cho- sen, of fate. At this point, we come full circle. There is yet the last part of the book, "Surrogates of Sensation," where Tiircke draws an interesting parallel between drugs and images and theorizes on the Trinity of addiction-film, church, and alcohol-as mutually excluding instances sharing the same modus operandi. What has been presented so far, however, should suffice for an assessment of the originality of Excited Society, as well as its drawbacks. For it is not only the case that each of the five chapters is loaded with exciting thoughts; Tiircke's assessment of the current situation is thoroughly cogent and binding. The problem with the book lies, rather, in structure. It does not cohere well for two reasons. First, there is a double temporality at stake: on the one hand the recent digital revolution, the outcome of a modernizing process closely re- lated to the Cold War; on the other, the longue durie (long indeed!) of the homo sapiens. The problem is that the structure of the latter is predicated on and dependent upon the former. Had history devel- oped in a slightly different way in the past thirty years, Tiircke's nice dialectical Darstellung would have fallen apart. Closely related to this, the implicit rereading of Dialectic of Enlightenment fails to keep the tension involved in Adorno and Horkheimer's idea of natural</page><page sequence="12">272 BOOK REVIEWS history. For them, a tension existed between the historicity of nature (our conception of it as different from, say, Augustine) and the nat- uralness of history, its immersion in transhistorical fear and suffer- ing-a good reminder today, when it is so fashionable to conceive of identities and culture as merely arbitrary, sheer objects of choice. This tension is not present in Excited Society; for all the stunning physio-theological interpretations, history is not in a force field with nature but is rather swallowed by it. As a result, Tiircke's proposal can only be the most modest one of pulling the breaks, slowing down the process in a "second best" salvaging of society (324). But perhaps that is not such a high price to pay for something that has become so unusual of late: the freedom to dare in thinking. UNDETERMINED DETERMINACY Kritik der ethischen Gewalt [Critique of Ethical Violence] is the pub- lished version of Judith Butler's 2003 Frankfurt Adorno lectures. The prize, awarded by the municipality, is in itself a contradictory event. On the one hand, it institutionalizes and monumentalizes Adorno's work and heritage, something he would hardly wish for himself and which he consistently refused to do-as in his short celebra- tory text "Keine Wiirdigung" ["Not an Appreciation"], where he praises Heinrich B611 for refusing to accept the role of "official poet" of the country.3 Institutional recognition, Adorno suggests, may very easily dilute dissonance, corrode the tension with the existing order of things. On the other hand, the prize has encouraged, indeed vir- tually forced, confrontations between contemporary thinkers and Adorno's philosophy, as with Derrida's elusive Fichus, the publica- tion of his 2001 lectures. In Butler's case, this is reflected in an oblique dialogue with Adorno's recently published lectures on moral philosophy (1996), mentioned several times in her text. The Adorno Prize here should also be seen as a token of acknowledg- ment, for Butler's works are not unknown to the German public. On the contrary, Suhrkamp has been lavishly publishing them and at least two introductory texts on Butler (always a sign of recogni- tion) are already available in the market. Indeed, given the abrupt and forceful eruption of gender and queer studies in Germany, as</page><page sequence="13">BOOK REVIEWS 273 manifested in the number of publications, university courses offered, and the unmediated fashion in which these American theories are imported, the feeling can hardly be repressed that underlying this enthusiasm there is a certain eagerness of the belated. Butler's starting point in Critique of Ethical Violence is the sub- ject's inaccessibility to its own conditions of existence. The subject's constitution is crossed by social norms and codes, which pre-exist the "I" and over which it has no control. They act as constraints to the formation a purely free, self-posed identity at the same time that they call such identity into being. The problem thus formulated is that the self is not self-transparent but owes its own possibility of emergence to a structural zone of blindness it has no access to. Ethical violence takes place when this constitutive blind spot is ig- nored or dismissed, and the subject, conceived as a translucent be- ing, one that furthermore is supposed to remain the same in time, becomes the source of all moral accountability. What Butler empha- sizes is exactly the opposite, namely that there are important ethical implications following from this unbridgeable gap in the subject's constitution. For this opaqueness is of the same kind as that pre- siding over the encounter between two subjects, which does not mean to say that they are symmetrical. An ethics thus emerges that takes place at the limits of knowledge as self-knowledge and knowl- edge of the other: It is possible that the question of ethics appears precisely at the lim- its of our systems of understandability, there where we ask ourselves what it could mean to engage in a dialogue for which we cannot pre- sume any common basis, when we find ourselves at the limits of our knowledge, as it were, and nevertheless must give and receive recog- nition. (30) Butler bases her theorization of the subject's inaccessibility to itself on the late work of Foucault, for whom subjectivity is no longer conceived as the restless result of a given discourse but rather becomes actively entangled in regimes of truth as well. Confession, for instance, "becomes the linguistic and corporal scene of self- demonstration of the subject. It speaks itself and only then becomes what it is" (118). The sinner is performatively produced in/through an act that mixes self-referentiality and social norm. It is this double</page><page sequence="14">274 BOOK REVIEWS aspect of confession, social imposition joined with the individual's turning to itself to become what it is, that lies at the core of But- ler's argument. This theoretical framework allows Butler to tackle the thorny problem of recognition, which she masterfully reconfigures in a post- Hegelian fashion and which draws her somewhat close to Adorno. The central question recognition presupposes, the stage on which it takes place, is "who are you?"-a question that according to Butler must remain open. When this openness is dissolved, when it is said, "Oh, now I know who you are" (57), then identity becomes fixed and the other's negativity, what is most precious to him/her, van- ishes. Just as Adorno's, Butler's approach to ethics refuses to deal with the world as achieved; unlike him, however, she does not relate incompleteness or lack to historical progress. What she does offer, instead, is the introduction of new concepts in this discussion, as that of interpellation, formerly discussed by her in very satisfactory terms (Butler 1997; published in Germany in 2001). In Critique of Ethical Violence, interpellation is handled in a more refined way than previously, for now it is made to include such pre- or nonlinguistic elements as touch. The subject's openness to the call of the other, which also represents its potential of being hurt, its Verletzbarkeit, stands as what is most fundamental in its constitution, to the point that life itself may depend on it. This scene accounts for the important discussion at the end of the book, where the subject's self-opacity is related to responsibil- ity, truth, and history, thus recapitulating the arguments exposed above. It is at this point, however, that a serious problem takes shape, one that had been lurking from the very start but that now becomes unavoidable. Take, for instance, the following passage, argumenta- tively unimportant because a reprisal, but discursively representative: From the fact that the subject has a history, it follows that it cannot be the founding act in the history of reason. However, the history of the subject is one in which reason has taken determinate forms, in which rationality was developed and instituted under determinate conditions and determinate limits. (123) The adjective determinate (bestimmt) here is symptomatic, for it means the opposite of what is says. "Determinate" forms of reason or</page><page sequence="15">BOOK REVIEWS 275 "determinate" conditions and limits should point to specific entities, but in Butler's text the adjective functions as an instrument of ab- straction and indeterminacy. In other words, unlike Adorno, Butler fails (or is unwilling) to give any degree of concreteness to her analy- ses; "moral codes," the "other," and "interpellation" are terms that could be thought together with any social formation. Their range is so wide that the contours of any potential antagonist cannot be delineated. Struggle takes place in a vacuum. One could ask, for instance: what would the scene of recognition look like in a coun- try such as mine, Brazil, where economic exclusion forces you, as a middle-class individual, daily to ignore the interpellation of a mul- titude of beings-beggars, bums, street sellers, even minor thieves? What would happen if this enforced lack of human recognition were coupled with a generalized interpellation, on the part of commodi- ties, promising happiness through consumption? What responses, then, could human Verletzbarkeit take? What would Butler's ethics amount to in this case? I do not mean to say that her theory could not prove valuable for such situations, far from it, but that its refor- mulation might not be compatible with a State prize. Notes 1. On page i we read that this is "the first attempt in any language to pro- vide an account of the ethical theory latent in Adorno's writings." To counter this piece of advertisement it is fair to observe that in Germany the topic is by no means new. See, for instance, Schweppenhiuser 1993 or Schweppenhiuser and Wischke 1995. 2.
