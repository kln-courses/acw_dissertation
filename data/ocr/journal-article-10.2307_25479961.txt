<plain_text><page sequence="1">N'debeka, Maxime. Sel-Piment a la braise. Paris: Dapper, 2003. ISBN 2-906067-98-9. Pp. 173.12 . The front cover of this first novel by an exiled writer from the Republique Democratique du Congo is startling and provides an immediate entrance into the atmosphere of the work: a middle-aged black man's face, prominent lips and nose, the eyes deep-set, narrowed, and piercing. This is the portrait of Vieux Zack, "Grand Scrutateur de la foi democratique et ordonnee" in Bangragra. The novel unites a wide variety of themes dealing with traditional, modernizing, postcolonial and pseudo-postcolonial Africa, under the rule of this man who is an inconsolable widower, doting father, implacable tyrant, and loyal patron to his sycophants, who came to power through the genius of his cooking. Vieux Zack began his legitimate career by preparing (stolen) chickens with a wildly popular sauce. But an old aunt from his ethnic group found ways in time of polit ical turmoil to add herbs that will cause enthusiasm or lethargy in those who eat it. This down-home remedy allows Vieux Zack to bind certain sectors of the pop ulation to him and render inert the ones who are a threat. One of the most evocative elements in the novel is the use of electronic mail in an African context. The mayor's e-mail system suddenly begins receiving sedi tious communications that he reports in secret to Vieux Zack. In the middle of the night the two men follow the work of the mayor's computer as it receives and prints a long elaboration of these opening threats. The vocabulary is filtered through the perceptions of the Grand Scrutateur, who is not at home with such machines: "organes", "ronronner", "cracher", and finally, the portable "tira un rideau noir sur son ecran". (60-61). This anthropomorphism is followed by the realization that the messages are harbingers of the voices of Vieux Zack's dead</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 819 victims. Once he has read their warnings, they leap out into office through a "faille ouverte" (63) in his skull to elaborate on the atrocities he has committed against his own family. All request their participation in the planned wedding of Vieux Zack's only daughter. Of course he refuses. But he has not had the last word. The scene of the wedding is narrated as if in slow motion, so deliberate and detailed is the prose, as opposed to the pace of the rest of the text. When everything is in place for the union, N'Debeka creates a scene that recalls Macbeth at the feast of his lords or King Christophe at the Mass of the As sumption in Aime Cesaire's play about Haiti's self-crowned tyrant. The ghosts of his victims appear before him, invisible to the crowd. His terror and rage nevertheless reveal to the suspicious wedding guests that it may be time to change sides. N'Debeka creates a representative, Boulvio, from the ex-colonial master coun try, L'Agence Centrale de VIntelligence. He has taken citizenship in the state of Bangragra but apparently works on both sides of the barrier. The novel begins and ends with a classic spy-novel scene when his replacement arrives in the city to exchange coded formulae (adapted to an African situation) that identify him to Boulvio. This conversation announces the latest in what is apparently a series of roll-overs in the government of Bangragra, in which the Agence, as well as local unrest and revenge, have a hand. Vieux Zack's daughter is engaged to a Frenchman, setting up a dynamic that N'Debeka uses well. The reader feels no search for the politically correct. Rather, the author is establishing a power struggle between two fathers who want their share of a magnificent ceremony, one civil and one religious. N'Debeka's style is buoyant, rapid, and uneven, seasoned both with slang and erudite language. His novel would be a good choice for advanced undergraduate courses in need of shorter, entertaining novels that deal with the ills of contempo rary Africa, without taking sides in the analysis of the causes of these ills.
