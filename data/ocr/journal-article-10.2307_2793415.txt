Bennet-Clark. With two text figures In 1954, the Musee de l'Homme acquired a small collection of pieces of African art, the gift of M. Andre Lefevre. This consisted chiefly of Bushongo (Bakuba) pieces, especially of cups and boxes, the forms and ornamental combinations of which figure fre- quently in writings on African art. One of these cups deserves particular attention. Its cylindrical form; the preference shown for the three-strand twist motif imbolo (on the outer wall and the outside base of the cup, where the closed imbolo approximates to a cross); the overall decorative treatment of the surface with interlacing diagonal incisions which form a background and with secondary motifs (chevrons and obtuse-angled twists, dembo or the toe pattern, all very flexibly treated in our example); the handle carved in the form of a loose knot, having on its upper part a face recalling the sun motifphila; the quality of the wood, with its brown patina and reddish highlights-all these form an ensemble well known to be characteristic of Bushongo art. However, in the centre of this cup, fitted into a hole I-4 centimetres in diameter, is a stopper which slightly recalls the anthropomorphic handles of Bakongo (Ba- wongo) ceremonial adzes I though our stopper, 8-9 centimetres high, is more finely worked. Its section is cylindrical only up to the head, wlhere the wood is hollowed out, causing the skull and coiffure to project backwards, in a manner reminiscent of the shape of Mangbetu women's heads. This similarity is strengthened by the hieratic cast of the features, with the almond-shaped mouth in relief, the slight definition of the cheekbones, the eye orbits and the nose which are placed high up near the top and very worn by the polishing of thumbs. The ears, which are small and sharply defined, underline the character of the head, which is supported on a long annulated neck. The stopper is loose, but the small gap between its end and the edge of the hole may lead one to think of a small wad (perhaps of vegetable fibre), which in securing the stopper would give it a different function. It should be noted that the external base of the stopper is cross-hatched with fine lines that fit perfectly into the general pattern on the base of the cup without any interruption in the design. There is no fault in the wood to which the existence of this hole, and of the head, could be attributed. We do not know of any comparable piece, either in the special- ist literature or in exhibition catalogues. The only known reference to our piece is in the catalogue by M. Charles Ratton of a sale of objects from the A. Lefevre collection on 6th May, I93I, which marks its brief transit at the Hotel Drouot (No. 98, illustrated on Plate III). The bidding did not reach 2000 francs! I70</page><page sequence="2">DECEMBER, I956 Man Nos. 194, 195 FIG. I. A BUSHONGO CUP IN THE MUSEE DE L HOMME FIG. 2. DETAILS OF THE BUSHONGO CUP The Musee Royal du Congo Belge has about ioo Bushongo cups, but not one is perforated or has an anthropomorphic stopper. The only piece that Professor Olbrechts mentions is a cup in the form of a truncated cone, very much carved over, from the middle of which rises a vertical tube carved in one piece with the whole. He also informs us that Dr. A. Maesen, who has recently returned from the Kasai region, has seen nothing like it. Thus we have a unique piece, the function of which remains unexplained. It may, however, be linked up with certain other Bushongo carvings, namely the handles of ceremonial adzes,' and the above mentioned cup, formerly in the collection of Iritz Van den Berghe, which is published by Dr. Olbrechts.2 We would add to these the cup 3 illustrated in Torday's section on Bushongo art, the general conception of which is identical with ours (hole and stopper excepted); and finally, the lid, in the form of a truncated pyramid, of a box for tukula (camwood) in the British Museum, also illustrated by Torday.4 This lid is perforated in the centre, and shoulders, arms and hands are carved on each side of the hole, suggesting that a head and neck were meant to be inserted.
