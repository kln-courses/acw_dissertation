The reviews received are printed here and are followed by a reply by the author. Author's Precis Since the time of Darwin, comparative anatomists and paleontologists have drawn a bewildering number and diversity of phylogenetic trees on ape and hominid evolu- tion. Until now, however, no consensus has been in sight. Estimates of the time of ape-hominid divergence vary from the Paleocene, about 60 million years ago (Hurzeler 1968: 229), to the Early Pleistocene, "perhaps some 2 to 4 million years ago" (Washburn and Hamburg 1965: 11). Even worse, many of the basic arguments currendy advanced in bones- and-teeth taxonomy have recendy been invalidated by research on ecological adaptations which indicate parallel or convergent evolution (e.g., Jolly 1970, Simons and Ettel 1970). Thus the scientific tools, the conceptual systems, and the fossil material available to comparative anatomists and paleontologists still appear to be entirely inadequate for coping with the problems of ape and human evolution. In this book, therefore, an attempt has been made to design a new synthesis by means of a multidisciplinary approach. Paleogeography and taxonomy. Geographic speciation is the only form of speciation among higher animals. Conse- quendy it should be possible, in principle at least, to reconstruct phylogenetic trees of descent from paleogeo- graphical and paleoecological maps that indicate the rele- vant faunal barriers. Neither the apes nor man can swim by nature; nor can the apes carry food and drinking water (juicy fruit) over long distances. Thus we have to look for water barriers and arid zones to explain and reconstruct the speciation and divergence of the apes and hominids. The core point is that neither incipient man nor the various ape species could ever have brnached off as long as they enjoyed free sexual intercourse with one another. Nor could they have survived side by side as long as there was intensive ecological competition between them. Behavioural evidence suggests that the ancestors of the orangutan always lived in trees in closed-canopy types of forest. It follows that they must have branched off from the original African ape stock and reached Asia before the continuous rain-forest connection was broken, i.e., shortly after the collision of the Afro-Arabian and Asian continents caused by continental drift at the beginning of the Miocene, but before that some process had caused a relatively less humid climate in Arabia and southwestern Asia. On the other hand, the chimpanzee, the gorilla, and man must have descended from an African member of the Dryopithecinae, i.e., a stock of semiterrestrial, semiar- boreal apes adapted to open forests, park landscapes, and patchwork types of forest-and-savanna vegetation. The thinning-out and parklandization of the tropical African rain forest during Middle Miocene times may be attributed (at least in part) to the bulldozer action of the evolving pachyderms, mainly the elephants. In a subsequent phase, the tectonic formation of the western branch of the African Great Rift Valley system, in combination with the Nile and Zambezi River systems, constituted a double set of barriers to creatures that could neither swim nor cross arid rain- shadow zones. Consequendy, the progressive desiccation of East Africa caused by the steady rise of the Rift mountain ridges, together with the general climatic trends during the Pliocene, must have converted the last-surviving dryopithecine (Proconsul) ape there into an upright-walking, drought-adapted, and "humanoid" type of bush and grass- land ape, i.e., in all probability the Homininae, stricdy speaking. In the remaining part of tropical Africa, between the Sahara and the Congo River system, a major barrier was formed by the Niger-Benue drainage system. West of this barrier and south of the Plio-Pleistocene Senegal River and Lake Araouane, between 170 N and 50 N, the alterna- tion of pluvials and interpluvials explains the origin of the ambiguous adaptations and the psychological profile of the chimpanzee.

Still later, during a very dry interpluvial, when the relict evergreen forest in the Gaboon-Cameroon area was thinned out by drought and elephant damage, the African branch of the gibbons could no longer swing from tree-crown to tree-crown and thus became extinct. Consequently a new niche in the canopy layer of the Central African rain forest became available to the chimpanzee, which at the same time retained its mosaic-forest and savanna-dwelling adaptations in the adjoining semidecidu- ous and sudanian vegetation belts. And finally, when man had developed the javelin and could kill large animals from a distance, presumably at some time in the Early or Middle Acheulian, he was able to penetrate into and populate the savanna and woodland territory of his biological rival and partial food competitor, the chimpanzee. Thus it appears that the prevailing ideas on great ape and human taxonomic affinities, as rendered in a dendro- gram in figure 1, are untenable in the light of both paleogeographical and eco-behavioural data. Instead, the evolutionary tree of the great apes and man should be drawn according to one of the two schemes in figure 2. Which dendrogram is the correct one depends on which barrier, the Western Rift Valley or the Niger-Benue system, is the older. In both cases, at any rate, the African apes should be classified among the Hominidae, instead of among the Pongidae. GORILLA CHIMP &gt;z ~~MAN ORANG / 20-30 M.YEARS AGO FIG. 1.

Alternative phyletic trees based on paleogeographical evidence. Dating the divergences. Stratigraphic and potassium-argon dating, in combination with geological, paleogeographical, paleoecological, and paleontological data, now allow us to draw a new and dated phylogenetic tree. From the El Fayum fossil finds we can presume that the gibbon divergence took place about 30 million years ago (Simons 1967). The orangutan must have branched off after the collision of the Afro-Arabian and Eurasian continents, but before the beginning of the formation of the Red Sea, i.e., in the Early Burdigalian, between 25 and 21 million years ago, The extinct giant apes from South Asia, Gigantopithecus, were presumably descendants of those dryopithecines which invaded all of southern Eurasia in Upper Vindobonian- Chinjian times, during a period of tectonic quiet in the Gulf of Aden area which may have enabled them to travel from Africa through southern Arabia to the Eurasian continent. Their divergence from the African stock, there- fore, can be put at 15-17 million years ago. The separation of the incipient, Homininae from the remaining African dryopithecines by the Western Rift Valley may have become effective when the Rift floor was submerged and a very large and swampy brackish lake was formed in the area of Lake Albert and Lake Edward, shortly before the close of the Miocene (Gautier 1965), i.e., about 14 million years ago. The dendrogram that results from these figures is rendered in figure 3. The gorilla-chimpanzee furcation, however, cannot be plotted with any such accuracy, because the only statement that can be made about the Niger-Benue barrier is that it was probably established at some time during the Pliocene. The Old World monkeys have been inserted in the diagram for the sake of completeness, but the estimate of their divergence time is quite crude. This scheme, of course, is as speculative as zoogeography and paleoecology. It is, however, based upon sound scientific background and can be tested by solid geological evidence. This is a substantial gain over the current state of affairs in hominoid taxonomy. CHIMP MAN ORANG GOR O.W. MONKEYS O 14 GIANT APES 16 Gigan 21-25 GIBBONS Hylob 30 FIG. 3. Phyletic tree based on paleogeography and paleoecology. There is yet another way to draw dendrograms, Recent work in biochemistry and related fields has opened new approaches for assessing phylogenetic affinities and calcu- lating datings of the furcations of the tree. The basic assumption is that the biochemical constitution of an animal species is essentially an internal affair. Consequently, the species will evolve biochemically by random mutations and genetic drift at a fairly constant long-term rate, without being tossed hither and thither by the vicissitudes of adaptations to changing environmental conditions. It fol- lows that biochemical "indexes of dissimilarity" or "im- munological distances" between animal species can be converted into figures for the evolutionary time distances between those species. One simply needs a paleontological zero point of time and a conversion formula to calibrate the biochemical "clock." For example, Goodman et al. (1969) postulated 30 million years for the Old World monkey-ape divergence and assumed that the time distances of the taxa that have furcated since then may be calculated in proportion to the weighted averages of the antigenic dif- ferences between the protein molecules in those taxa. The outcomes of these calculations were 19 million years for the gibbons, 14 million years for the orangutan, and 6 million years for the African apes and man. Several objec- tions, however, may be raised: First, the zero point of time was ill-chosen, and secondly, the conversion formula did 428 C U R R E N T A N T H R O P O L O G Y</page><page sequence="3">Kortlandt: APE AND HUMAN EVOLUTION not take into account the deceleration of the evolutionary process which must have resulted from the increasing generation cycle time, owing to increasing cephalization and body size during higher-primate evolution. A revised calculation, based upon a gibbon time distance of 30 million years and a constant rate of evolutionary change per generation time unit (instead of per calendar time unit), yields estimates of 24-26 million years for the orangutan and 12-15 million years for the African apes and man. More recent biochemical work supports these figures. (See also the paper by Lovejoy, Burstein, and Heiple 1972, which was published after I had written this chapter in my book.) Sophisticated biochemical taxonomy and dating are thus perfectly consistent with the inferences tentatively drawn from zoogeography and paleoecology. The cherished con- cept of ape-hominid taxonomic "apartheid" can no longer be maintained. The apparent affinities of the orangutan with the African apes are deceptive and should be attributed to convergent evolution, due to their similar specialization as large fruit-eaters. The most plausible common ancestor of our contemporary African apes and man is Dryopithecus (Proconsul) africanus. Ramapithecus. The new timetable leaves no place for the Ramapithecus lineage (including Kenyapithecus) as human ancestors. Unfortunately, their fossil material is still insuffi- cient to determine their proper status in the dendrogram. It seems obvious, however, that they must have branched off from the other apes about 20-25 million years ago, or possibly more. Perhaps Arabia was their homeland. This subcontinent has been virtually isolated by water barriers for most of the time since about 21-25 (probably 24) million years ago. We may expect, therefore, that it bred its own lineage of apes in Miocene times. Furthermore, owing to its geographical position, we may assume that the Mio-Plio- cene trend of climatic desiccation set in earlier and was more severe here than in East Africa. Thus a suitable ecological niche for a "humanoid" (though not hominine) type of grassland and bush-savanna ape with a cereal- grinding and nut-cracking dentition was available in Arabia long before East Africa offered a cradle for the nascent australopithecines, and possibly also long before southern Asia was ready for the evolution of the gigantopithecines. And finally, the ephemeral occurrence of the ramapithe- cines in Eurasia and Africa, amidst a crowd of dryopithe- cines, suggests that they were rare strays from elsewhere which could not compete with the other apes because their canines were not large enough to enable them to fight the others for food. From all this it appears that trends of human(o)ization occurred independently in three taxa of apes which supposedly lived in isolated areas with desiccating habitats in East Africa, Arabia, and southern Asia: the Dryopithecus-Australopithecus, Dryopithecus-Rama- pithecus, and Dryopithecus-Gigantopithecus lineages, respec- tively. It is, after all, always the ecosystem as a geographical entity that shapes the creature. The gracile and the robust. Above, I was still able to refer to "prevailing ideas" in ape and human taxonomy. As soon as one begins to write about the so-called australopithecines, however, the residues of consensus virtually evaporate. It may seem a platitude to state that there would be no problem if neither the remnants of Ramapithecus (including Ken- yapithecus) nor those of Paranthropus(including all the robust forms) had been found. Given the paleoecological condi- tions that existed in East Africa, one can imagine a perfect lineage that led from Dryopithecus africanus via an early form of Australopithecus (sensu stricto) and an array of subsequent transitional forms (such as homo habilis and "TelanthropuS") towards full human status. The fossil rem- nants, the tools, and the paleoecological data all fit in neatly with this evolutionary model. The acceleration of the adaptive process may be explained by the Late Pliocene and Early Pleistocene tectonic rejuvenation that occurred in East Africa. The absence of stone tools and the stagnancy of evolution in the South African gracile ape-men during the Villafranchian does not pose an insurmountable prob- lem either. This branch lived in seclusion behind the Western Rift, Zambezi, and Limpopo barriers. Thus they were shielded from the mainstream of protohuman evolu- tion in East Africa, residing in a country without drastic tectonic events or major climatic changes, and amidst a rather archaic and endemic fauna. Nothing happened to them there until "Telanthropus' and Paranthropus invaded their territory and terminated their existence. The real problems emerge with the robust ape-men. Many anatomical details suggest that they were rather apelike creatures. Ecologically, they were adapted to sudanian and miombo woodlands, which were moister than the sahelian, dry-sudanian, and mopane vegetations where the gracile form was at home (according to the South African data). Allometrically, their brain capacity was on a par with that of the chimpanzee and significantly smaller than that of Australopithecus (sensu stricto). In other respects, however, the robust forms were more "humanized" than the gracile ones. Their faces were flatter and their jaws less prognath- ous. Their dentitions were better adapted to cracking, grinding, and rotationally chewing the hard, coarse, and dry types of food which predominate in dry savanna, sahelian, and subdesertic environments, i.e., in humanoid types of habitat. Their big body size and hefty build also suggest a more advanced evolutionary status. This hetero- geneity of features asks for an evolutionary explanation. Ape-men of the woodlands. The fossil finds of robust ape-men known to date cover a time-span beginning about 5 or 4 million years ago and ending about three-quarters or half a million years ago. During this period they evolved from "hyperrobust" to semigracile forms. This trend of convergence between the robust and the gracile lineage suggests, first, that the two taxa diverged quite long ago, i.e., probably at some time in the Miocene, and, secondly, that their resemblance in the Pleistocene should be attribut- ed chiefly to adaptation to similar habitats, rather than to close taxonomic affinity. Futhermore, certain dental and cranial characteristics suggest that the relatively conservative anatomical features in the biological makeup of Paranthropus reached a relatively "advanced" grade of evolution, whereas the relatively changeable features retained a more "prima- tive" condition, as seen from an anthropocentric perspec- tive.This may indicate that the robust lineage underwent a humanoizing selection pressure for a longer time-span, but in a lesser degree, than the gracile-Homo taxon. In other words, the humanoization of the robust branch had already begun in Miocene times, but the ecosystem which shaped them was not yet "advanced" enough to model them into true men. Consequently the firstlings eventually became the drop-outs when, during the Pliocene, the real hominines made a new start from a more primitive form, but under a stronger selection pressure. Much the same applies to the locomotor apparatus. The pelvis and femur of Paranthropus show an odd mixture of apish, human, "hyperhuman," and even bearlike fea- tures. His thumb is reminiscent of that 6f the gorilla. He was certainly not a long-distance walker like man, but probably a much better climber than we are. Some charac- teristics indicate that he may have been a part-time quadru- ped and knuckle-walker. All this suggests that he was adapted chiefly to woodlands and open forests with a very dense undergrowth, i.e., habitats resembling the present- Vol. 15 No. 4 December 1974 429</page><page sequence="4">day "forets seches denses" and "muhulu" relict forests, where his primary concern was getting away by fleeing through the bush and by leaping and climbing a tree as quickly as lightning when he suddenly came upon a large beast of prey, a bad-tempered rhino, or some similar danger. This interpretation is supported by parallels drawn from the locomotor adaptations to swamp forests shown by both the chimpanzee and Oreopithecus. In summation, the concept of man, and of humanoid beings in general, should not be conceived as a unitary and ganzheitliches concept. On the contrary, trends towards humanoization converged from various angles and were present on all primate-inhabited Old World continents. Even madagascar had its own lemurian humanoid. Full "prehuman" or "nascent human" status has apparently been reached twice, and independendy. Man's shadow. If during the Mio-Pliocene the climatic and ecological conditions on different continents or sub- continents became more uniform, one can expect that the different man-apes and ape-men on these continents or subcontinents eventually became more uniform also. Such a convergence would even -have been inevitable if the non-ape mammal fauna were able to cross the barriers freely because they could swim, whereas the apes could not. Is this what actually happened to the robust and gracile lineages? Ramapithecus may provide the clue. If it is correct that he branched off some 21-25 (probably 24) million years ago when the Red Sea trough was formed, and if it is also correct that the African apes and man diverged about 12-15 million years ago when the Rift barrier became insurmountable, nothing seems more plausible than the simple assumption that the robust stock evolved from Ramapithecus in Arabia and the gracile-Homo lineage from Dryopithecus (probably africanus) in East Africa.

Tentative scheme of the adaptive evolution of the Afro- Arabian great apes and humanoids (lines do not fully indicate the widths of the ranges of ecological adaptation). There is some interesting evidence to support this hypothesis. The case of Gigantopithecus shows that some 15 million years of seed-grinding and nut-cracking in a desiccating habitat were still insufficient to reduce the canine teeth entirely. The proposed scheme would, therefore, explain the difference in canine reduction between the gracile and the robust taxa. Furthermore, the prolonged dry seasons in subtropical Arabia would explain the pro- nounced and hyperrobust "nut-cracking" adaptations in the dentition of the early ("ZinjanthropuS" and "Paraus- tralopithecus") forms of Paranthropus, whereas the shorter, biannual dry season in equatorial East Africa, with its abundance of more fleshy food, would explain the gracili- zation of the later forms. Similar arguments may be ap- plied to various other aspects of the dental, cranial, pelvic, and limb morphology. The possibility of a biphyletic human(o)ization of the so-called australopithecines, more or less as proposed by Napier (1964), therefore deserves serious consideration. An intriguing question is how the two humanoids could have coexisted side by side, and evolved in convergent directions, for a stretch of some 3 to 4 million years at the least. One possibility is that they developed a symbiosis based upon a mutual antipredator defense system, in which the one was a better spotter and the other a better fighter. Evidence of similar relationships between chimpanzee and man in Africa supports this speculation. Appendix I: The use of (rudimentary) weapons by apes and man. A research program on agonistic tool-use among Primates which my former co-workers and I have conducted since 1954 has resulted in an inventory of the motor patterns involved in such behavior among the great apes and man. No less than 10 or 11 of the 13 patterns listed are shared by the African apes and man, whereas the orangutan shares with them only 4, or perhaps 5. Typically forest-adapted patterns also occur in savanna-dwelling chimpanzees, though in an underdeveloped manner, and even in man, in a modified functional context. Typically savanna-adapted patterns occur equally in the gorilla, though in a rudimen- tary form, whereas they are absent in the orangutan. These and other behavioural data support the phyletic trees proposed in figures 2, 3, and 4. In addition, certain aspects of the survival value of such behaviour are clarified. Appendix II: "Hunting" and "predatory" behaviour in chimpanzees and man. Carnivorous habits have been observed to occur occasionally among all genera of Primates, with the exception of the orangutan. With regard to the Old World genera, the technical details of both the zoo data and the wildlife data suggest that such behaviour, rather than being a normal part of everyday life, represents some kind of emergency potential occurring in exceptional ecolo- gical conditions, e.g., in cases of bush-fires, locust plagues, or severe drought. Food competition and social stress may be among the eliciting factors. Furthermore, since predation on medium-sized prey seems to occur exclusively among baboons and chimpanzees east of the 29th meridian in Africa, i.e., in the former Australopithecus-Parathropus range, there appear to be special ecological factors conducive to the evolution of larger-game predation in this area. With regard to the chimpanzee, however, this is only part of the story. The large amount of data now available from East Africa shows that they hunt, kill, and eat predominantly baboons and monkeys, furthermore certain species of hoofed mammals, and (in two observed cases) out-group baby conspecifics-i.e., chiefly food competitors. In addition to the choice of prey objects, the apparent dietary needs, the sex and age composition of the hunters, the facial and gestural expressions in this behaviour, the social context, and the spectrum of killing techniques all suggest that such so-called predatory behaviour is, strictly speaking, not true predatory behaviour at all. That is, it is not primarily a form of food-getting behaviour. Rather, it seems to be a drastic type of food-competitor control, combined with a masculine type of social intimidation display redirected towards a substitute object and followed by the peaceful consumption of the victim in a context of reassurance behaviour, possibly due to some kind of neurophysiological rebound or ethological displacemernt mechanism. Formulated anthropomorphically, it unites showing-off for insiders with heroism against outsiders, as in the human affluent blood sports. 430 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="5">Kortlandt: APE AND HUMAN EVOLUTION Reviews by BENNErr BLUMENBERG and NEIL B. TODD Newtonville, Mass., U.S.A. 7 III 74 We have been intrigued by Kortlandt's dehumanization hypothesis of hominoid evolution. This proposes that much zoogeography, anatomy, and behavior of great apes is consistent only with descent from a common ancestor (including that of hominids) that was savanna-adapted. It therefore comes as a disappointment to find this theme neglected and subordinated to a less attractive notion, the so-called rift hypothesis. This holds that the hominoid radiation is solely a by-product of partitioning of the last ancestral population and subsequent geographic isolation behind river and desert barriers. The "fundamental scien- tific philosophy" that geographic speciation is the only possible mechanism is simply naive. A citation does not validate this conception as Kortlandt would wish to infer. In any case, formidable as barriers may have been to apes that can neither swim nor carry water, it is impossible to believe they went unbreached for millions of years. Following the hypothesis unwaveringly makes the orangutan the odd man out in the great-apes-man quartet. The independent "proofs" cited to support this are at best equivocal. Another problem is the relationship of the African apes to one another. The rift hypothesis calls for divergence "after the Mio-Pliocene desiccation had reached a point where the Sudanian river barriers could no longer be circumvented . . . roughly between 15 and 5 million years ago." This ignores the possibility that Dryopithecus africanus and D. major, Miocene contemporaries of East Africa, were ancestral to Pan and Gorilla. Ramapithecus, which constitutes an embarrassment to the hypothesis, is dealt with rather summarily. Since the dis- tribution of this form does not fit the model proposed, it is dismissed as an Arabian autochthon, arising in isolation and known only as a "rare stray from elsewhere." At the same time Ramapithecus is presumed to have been evolving in isolation, straying occasionally into Africa and India, the East African dryopithecine ancestors of Pongo and Gigantopithecus are suggested to have walked through Aden to India. Even if Ramapithecus is discovered in Arabia, the inconsistencies of the argument are not resolved. Kortlandt properly emphasizes that prehuman status was probably reached several times in lineages that did not go on to become human, Oreopithecus, Paranthropus, and Pan. The Ramapithecus material seems to most researchers to show hominid affinities, in particular those which bridge the gap between Dryopithecus and Australopithecus-Homo. There also seems to be broad agreement among South and East African workers that a robust vegetarian hominid is such, be it labelled A. robustus-boisei or Paranthropus, and that in each region such a hominid was sympatric with a Homo species. Kordlandt's desire to reduce Australopithecus to subgeneric status under the genus Homo (unless he is referring only to A. africanus) contradicts virtually all of the published work of the past decade, which establishes a fundamental difference between the robust herbivorous Plio/Pleistocene hominid and a gracile omnivorous homi- nid of the same period. The main source of present controversy seems to be the phylogenetic status of the H. habilis fossils found at Olduvai. Some workers believe all or part of this material represents an australopithecine population, A. habilis. Given Kortlandt's predilection for pointing out differences in points of view, it is strange that he never refers to this problem. The appendices, which concern themselves with an inter- pretation of weapon use, hunting, and predatory behavior among chimpanzees and gorillas, are extraordinarily inter- esting and provocative and are an outgrowth of Kortlandt's earlier work. Unfortunately his phylogenetic scheme does not seem to be supported by the extant published analyses of Plio/Pleistocene fossil hominids. by KARL W. BUTZER Chicago, Ill., U.S.A. 26 xii 73 A fresh scrutinization of the hominoid evolutionary record in terms of paleoecology and accurate dating of paleo- geographic events is certainly commendable, although it need not be more "speculative" than other facets of pa- leoanthropology. The evidence supports some of Kort- landt's generalizations, but there are significant contra- dictions that may require modification of his thesis. The Miocene "Nile-Zambezi barrier" is highly vulnerable. In the critical Western Rift, there is an extended erosional break between the (early?) Miocene lacustrine or fluvio-la- custrine beds (Mohari, Kabuga, Kisegi formations) and the Pliocene Kaiso Formation (ca. 5-2 million years) (Gautier 1970, Cooke and Maglio 1972, Bishop and Trendall 1967). Whether or not local basins of deposition (?Passage Beds: Bishop 1968) persisted is immaterial, since the bulk of the sediments reflect shallow lakes with strongly fluctuating margins, laid down long before the gradual sinking of the rift floor that only began in Kaiso times. This situation applies more broadly to the southern Sudan and south-cen- tral Africa and hardly constitutes a zoogeographic "barrier." A Plio-Pleistocene "Niger-Benue barrier" is little more convincing. Buser (1966), Tricart (1965), Blanck (1968), and Michel (1973) have shown that the middle and upper Niger drainage was finally integrated quite late in the Pleistocene, with prolonged intervals of internal drainage that terminated on plains of coalescent alluvial fans. Similar conditions are suggested for the southern fringes of the Chad Basin (Pias 1968), with only brief and incidental overflow from the Chad to the Adlantic drainage. If Simons, Pilbeam, and Boyer (1971) are correct that the Chinji Formation of the Siwaliks lacks Hipparion, it probably predates 12.5 million years (Van Couvering 1972), confirming a mid-Miocene age (ca. 15 million years) for the first dryopithecines of India. Yet, there is a complication to Kordlandt's mid-Tertiary migration of African apes to Asia, in that the Sahara-Arabian desert axis is verified since Paleozoic times, impeding migration via Suez, while down- warping and downfaulting of the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea began during the early Oligocene (Gass 1970). Further, the absence of Miocene megafaunas from the Arabian Peninsula cannot be simply attributed to dollar- oriented petroleum geologists. Quite apart from the politi- cally imposed restrictions on publication, the geological situation itself does not look favorable in regard to potential sites. On the west and south coasts, the Miocene is recorded only by narrow segments of marine beds, evaporites, reef limestones, and some coarse detrital beds that seem to lack any mammalian fossils; in eastern Saudi Arabia, broad expanses of similar, but sand-veneered and poorly exposed rocks form part of the Mesopotamian-Persian Gulf geosyn- cline (Powers et al. 1966, Beydoun and Greenwood 1968) a structure that has also failed to yield Miocene mammals in Syria and Iraq, where more intensive research has been under way for several generations. The localization of Miocene shoreline facies and the nature of the interdigitated terrestrial sediments leaves little doubt that most of the peninsula was exposed to semiarid and arid denudational processes, just as was the eastern Sahara at this time (Butzer Vol. 15 No. 4 Decemnber 1974 431</page><page sequence="6">and Hansen 1968: chap. 9; Whiteman 1971); the presence of large vertebrates in the early Miocene fluvial beds of northern Egypt is directly linked to the presence of a major allochthonous river (see Said 1962:200). Even the Fayum Oligocene environment was not a "dense forest" (Kortlandt, fig. 17), but a galeria forest following a permanent river meandering through a semiarid landscape (Bowen and Vondra 1974). It is therefore incumbent upon Kortlandt to show that Arabia was the home of nut-cracking "human- oids" in Miocene times. The South African australopithecine breccias do not demonstrate that robust australopiths inhabited "sudanian and miombo woodlands" with "very dense undergrowth" or gracile australopiths a "sahelian, dry-sudanian, mopane" vegetation. It has already been argued (Butzer 1971) that each of the fossiliferous, detrital cave fills of the Transvaal basically represents colluvial sediments compatible only with an incomplete mat of vegetation and an environment comparable to or drier than that of today. Since then, systematic sediment work on a large suite of samples, carried out in conjunction with C. K. Brain, has begun to show that each sedimentary unit of each cave is more or less unique. Thus, the "pink" or "paranthropine" breccia at Swartkrans begins with a rapid accumulation of blocks and residual soil below a newly opened sinkhole-bringing in an older residue from a former surface depression or external cave; subsequent beds record slow, episodic erosion of surface soils that were then washed into the cave and perhaps locally intermixed with travertines or channelled into pools of standing water. Preliminary X-ray studies of the clay minerals appear to confirm that long periods of slope stability and pedogenesis marked the depositional breaks within the cave. Combined with evidence for signifi- cant changes of the water table, these alternations do point to major climatic changes, but the patterns can all be reconciled with an open regional vegetation, possibly punc- tuated by trees in sinkholes and valley bottoms. Similar general inferences can now be made for Sterkfontein and Makapansgat, as well as for Taung, where the juvenile australopithecine was present during a relatively wet phase (see my article in this issue). It remains to consider the claim of increasing aridity in tropical Africa since the mid-Miocene. Evaluation of the admittedly meagre Tertiary record of Africa shows climatic alternations on a fairly large scale, but no demon- strable trend. Accumulating stratigraphic evidence indicates a late Eocene to Miocene age for most of the sandstones of the Kalahari System and its apparent equivalent, the "Continental Terminal" of West Africa and Mozambique, with various episodes of superficial eolian and colluvial reworking through the Pliocene and Pleistocene. In the Eastern Rift, accelerated rift fracturing since the mid-Mio- cene created an increasingly complex mosaic of forest and open vegetation, wet mountain slopes and rainshadows, semideserts and lake plains. The wealth of ecological opportunities so provided persisted in some form or other through time, despite any zonal or altitudinal shifts of climate. In this way, the Eastern Rift did not present an "insurmountable" barrier to faunal movements. by KAI CURRY-LINDAHL Nairobi, Kenya. 24 xii 73 The subject of New Perspectives on Ape and Human Evolution is fascinating, the style entertaining, and the theories stimulating and provoking. I shall take up some ecological and paleoecological points which might be relevant for the discussion. Kortlandt postulates that the ancestors of the orangutan branched off from the African ape stock at a time when there was still a more or less continuous rain-forest connec- tion between Africa and Asia, probably in the Early Miocene. However, the idea that Africa was to a great extent covered with forest until the Miocene is based on unstable grounds. Present data indicate that forests, savannas, and arid areas coexisted in Africa in a pattern rather similar to that of recent periods, but with the limits of the vegetational belts oscillating north and south. This mobility of biomes during the Miocene must have influenced animal dispersal and evolution; it also makes it difficult to date significant events of the primate evolutionary process in Africa. The opening up, thinning out, and savannization of African rain forests in Miocene times is attributed by Kortlandt partly to the effect of bulldozing herbivores, chiefly elephants. Although no other mammal except man can modify woodland savannas so profoundly as the ele- phant, it is unlikely that the latter could achieve the same alteration in rain forests. More present natural lowland and montane rain forests of Africa contain elephant popu- lations, and their impact on these biomes is minimal. A mature rain forest can hardly be opened up by elephants, because the understorey recovers immediately and larger trees are not affected at all. In rain forests, elephants usually stick to paths, which are well maintained by the elephants themselves and probably very old. Of course, buffaloes and other ungulates also travel these "corridors." It is difficult to understand why the author characterizes the gorilla as "a sort of drop-out or degenerate." Although the gorilla has been less successful than the chimpanzee as far as habitat flexibility and range are concerned, it in no way appears degenerate. Its somewhat nomadic habits and the social relations within family groups and between clans seem to work well and show striking parallels to those of the rain-forest pygmies, who are also admirably well adapted to their environment. The limiting factors for both the lowland and the mountain gorillas are shrinking habitats due to the encroachment of man and perhaps a rather slow reproduction. Kortlandt points out that the adaptation of the chimpan- zee to the rain forest is still incomplete and believes that the extinction of the African branch of the gibbons created a new niche for the chimpanzee in the rain-forest canopy. It can be argued whether the brachiating gibbons and the more ground-adapted chimpanzees really utilize the same niche, even though chimps climb easily and sleep in trees. However, this is not the point. The author bases his reasoning on present population densities of chimpanzees in lowland and montane rain forests. He has invariably found the "highest population densities" in montane forest and secondary lowland forests in comparison with primary lowland forests. So have I, working periodically in Africa (chiefly Zaire) since 1951. I think this is due to the food availability in the dense undergrowth of montane and secondary lowland rain forests in comparison with the rather sparse undergrowth of the primary lowland forest. Since the secondary forests are rather recent, this means that the chimps' adaptation to these habitats is also recent. The gorilla and the okapi show parallels to this in many areas of the lowland rain forests of Zaire. It is not true, however, that chimpanzees have not been "observed in the truly primary evergreen rain forests north and northeast of the Congo River in the Congo Basin." I have observed them in climax habitats of the Ituri Forest and other eastern parts of the lowland rain forest (see, for example, Curry-Lindahl 1953, 1956). Most of the observations of chimps in the Liberian Nimba Mountains from 1963 to 1972 have been in virgin high forest, which is not semideciduous in character, but this may be due to the fact that the apes are less disturbed there than elsewhere. 432 C U R R E N T A N T H R O P O L O G Y</page><page sequence="7">Kortlandt: APE AND HUMAN EVOLUTION The assumption that there existed a fundamental rela- tionship of mutual benefit between the contemporary Australopithecusand Paranthropus is based on the speculation that the symbiosis worked to evade carnivores. Kortlandt's interesting discussion on the enigma of the coexistence of the two humanoids excludes what in my opinion seems the simplest explanation. Rather than search for a symbio- sis-like relationship favouring both, I would suggest that it is more constructive to look for the ecological difference that kept the two species going without closer competition. I suppose the answer is that Paranthropus, with its massive molars, was mainly or entirely a vegetarian, while Aus- tralopithecus was probably omnivorous but certainly had carnivorous habits. Is this important difference not enough to explain lack of competition? A somewhat similar situation is displayed in Africa at present by the partly overlapping gorilla and chimpanzee. Kortlandt's main hypothesis is that man, gorilla, and chimpanzee are classified among the Hominidae, while the orangutan is alone in the Pongidae. He assumes that many people will be shocked to find two apes in man's family. I find this close relationship flattering for man, because having periodically observed gorillas and chimpanzees in the wild for two decades I am full of admiration for them. If man could solve his population problems in the same way as these apes, we would be fortunate. by ERIC DELSON New York, N.Y., U.S.A. 15 I74 Kortlandt's book is, as he intended, a stimulating review and interpretation of human origins. While he makes certain points not generally recognized by specialists, any attempt at a full summary at this time is premature, especially because the two years since most of the book was finished have been among the most productive of new data, in the form of fossil and stratigraphic evidence and reinterpretation. The dating of the later Tertiary boundaries has been the subject of several recent studies revealing that previous definitions of these boundaries are incorrect. As discussed by various researchers (e.g., Berggren 1972, Berggren and Van Couvering 1974, Delson 1974, Van Couvering 1972, Van Couvering and Miller 1971), approximate dates for the beginning of (sub) epochs would be: Early Miocene, 23 million years; Middle Miocene, 16 million years; Late Miocene, 11 million years; Pliocene, 5 million years; Pleisto- cene, 2 million years. This is not a redating of paleonto- logical events for the most part, but a calibration of dates and boundaries whose names have been used by many workers in differing senses. It is important because "Late Miocene" has meant 15-12 million years ago for Kortlandt but as late as 11-5 million years ago for stratigraphers such as Gautier (1970). The strongest aspect of Kordandt's work is the emphasis on geographic speciation and its ecological implications. His application of geographical and ecological data to the problem of the divergence and subsequent history of chimpanzee and gorilla is fascinating and clearly merits further analysis by eco-ethologists as well as paleontologists and morphologists. The significance of allopatric speciation in paleontology, ably argued by Kortlandt, is now becoming more obvious to researchers. For example, Eldredge and Gould (1972) have suggested that the fossil record is not so "woefully incomplete" just because one cannot observe most species transformations directly in the rocks, but because such evolutionary transformations usually took place rapidly, on the periphery of an ancestral species's range, and were followed by migrations and spreading of the new species-the same model accepted by most students of Recent animals. Thus, most of a (past) species's life span was dominated by a homeostatic constancy of morphology (with fluctuations due to short-term selective forces), rather than by gradual evolutionary progression resulting from long-continuing selection. Given many epi- sodes of geographic speciation, only a few would be success- ful, and "the overall effect would then be one of net, apparently directional change" (p. 112). The human fossil record may eventually be one which could serve to test this hypothesis (see also Eldredge and Tattersall 1974 and Van Valen 1966). In dealing with actual fossils and morphology, Kortlandt is considerably less incisive: he arrives at some intriguing conclusions based on unsubstantiated assumptions. He assumes that the split between the 10-14-million-year-old hominoid Ramapithecus and earlier Dryopithecus populations must have taken place before 20 or 25 million years ago. Then (p. 71), he is amazed that his "generally accepted paleontological divergence dates" are not espoused by Uzzell and Pilbeam (1971), who argue for a 15-20-million- year divergence. Even the acceptance of Dryopithecus major as a protogorilla does not force the ancestry of Ramapithecus (or man) back to an equivalent date, unless biomolecular evidence is taken as requiring this. I prefer to see D. major as an ecological convergence on some gorillas and would accept a 15-16-million-year origin for the Ramapithecus lineage. It is further unwarranted for Kortlandt to locate the homeland of Ramapithecus in Arabia in part because the fossils of this genus are rare elsewhere. It may always have been a rare element of the Middle Miocene fauna- certainly it was an "aberrant" hominoid, whether ancestral to any hominids or merely distinct from typical Dryopithecus. In a similar vein, small-sized Dryopithecus is rare in Eurasia (D. Iaietanus), but the most common size grade found in Africa (D. africanus)-is this chance or meaningful? The paleoecological discussion here is also incomplete, especially in reference to environment and potential predators (see Andrews and Van Couvering 1974; Delson 1974; Kurten 1971, 1972). There are no morphological features which point to a special relationship between Ramapithecus and the robust as opposed to the gracile australopiths, much les5 an ancestor-descendant link between them. Furthermore, Walker and Andrews (1973) have shown that Fort Ternan Ramapithecus wickeri had a U-shaped palate, narrow\ incisor region, and short, broad face, features whose implications are not yet understooa. Finally, care must be taken in looking for convergences to the humanoid: Oreopithecus, on reexamination, seems much less humanoized than has been thought (Szalay and Berzi 1973); the view that Gi- gantopithecus is a possible ancestor of some or all Aus- tralopithecus (s.l.) involves bending of the time-scale and questionable determination of the ancestral morphology expected in early hominids (see Eckhart 1972, Robinson 1972, Frayer 1973); Hadropithecus was in no way a human- oid, both genera of the Archaeolemurinae simply being postcranially and dentally convergent on the larger African cercopithecids (Tattersall 1973). Kortlandt's analysis of Australopithecus basically suffers from having been written too soon. After a period in the late 1960s when Australopithecus was somewhat out of the spotlight (perhaps because of few new finds except for the overblown controversy over "Homo habilis"), the last few years have seen many intensive studies of both older finds and the numerous new ones, most appearing after much of Kortlandt's work was done (although Leakey 1972 is cited): Brace, Holloway, Lewis, Lovejoy, Mann, Wolpoff, and Zihlman are conspicuous for their absence. Vol. 15 No. 4 December 1974 433</page><page sequence="8">In sum, this book has served a useful purpose in promot- ing discussion such as this one, but we are far from being able to write a full story of hominoid evolution. Kortlandt would perhaps do best to put off his second edition for some time and instead work further on the topics he has handled so well, such as chimpanzee behavior (but without chauvinistic paternalism toward womanly patience [p. 76]) and the eco-geographical approach to chimp and gorilla origins, as well as continuing to prod paleoanthropologists with skepticism, but in smaller and more concise doses. by MIrsuo IWAMOTO Inuyama, Japan. 31 xiI 73 The author says several times that a majority of experts in comparative anatomy and paleontology and taxonomists will reject his evolutionary tree of apes and man (fig. 2). In fact, his clear discussions somewhat embarrassed me, even though I have no definite beliefs on the details of ape and human evolution. In any case, the perspectives offered in this book must come to play a unique and very important role for future studies and discussions of ape and human evolution. I would make the following com- ments: On the basis of the divergence of apes and man as shown in figure 2, the author concludes -that the African apes should be classified among the Hominidae, instead of among the Pongidae. Isn't it still possible, however, for the Hominidae to be defined only by man, as a line which diverged from the basic pongid line and rather rapidly proceeded toward "humanization"? The "biochemical" re- semblances between African apes and man are indeed remarkable, but this seems not necessarily to mean that they resemble each other in the whole of their genetic makeup. Should we think more in terms of particular behavioral and physical adaptive changes in the "humaniza- tion" process? Surely "the taxonomic nomenclature aims to reflect the successive phylogenetic furcations," but this cannot become an absolutely strict rule. Why don't we classify the birds among the reptiles which gave rise to them in the Jurrasic? Accepting the author's above-men- tioned conclusion, on the other hand, we would able to classify the orangutan too among the Hominidae, because the physical resemblances between the orangutan and the African apes could mean not convergent but parallel evolution. The author explains well why the P-type of "aus- tralopithecines" should be separated from the A-type at a remote time in the phyletic tree, but I feel that the P-type appears to bear many more morphological resemblances or affinities to the A-type than to the African apes and wonder if these really should be or can be simply explained by convergence. The supposition of convergence is some- times very useful for the understanding of evolutionary diversity, but the more useful it is, the more we must avoid using it to excess. As for the "australopithecines," there seem to remain many problems to be discussed. by T. JACOB Jogjakarta, Indonesia. 10 I 74 Kortlandt has written a very interesting preliminary edition of new perspectives on hominoid evolution usingin partic- ular paleogeographical and paleoecological data. Several views and interpretations presented are certainly thought- provoking. He contends that the African apes should be classified among the Hominidae, thus avoiding taxonomical "apart- heid." By deemphasizing differences in this manner, there will be no difficulty in the lumping into one taxon of Pan and Gorilla: (one genus) Australopithecus, Pithecanthropus, and Homo (one genus); and Ramapithecus, Gigantopithecus, Dryopithecus, and Homo (one family). Then, of course, the subfamily Homininae becomes important, a sort of "apartheid" at a lower taxonomic level. Kortlandt ingeniously reconciles the time distances of ape-hominine divergence obtained by biochemical methods with those obtained from zoogeographical and paleoeco- logical evidence and arrives at the figure of 15-17 million years. He returns to Dryopithecus africanus for the common ancestor. Dental similarities between the African apes and Pongo are deceptive, according to Kortlandt; they are simply due to adaptation as large fruit eaters. It is important to note here that chromosome number in the three great apes is the same, and greater than in man or in the gibbon, the latter with a time distance of only 4 million years. But it is true that in chromosome morphology and total length of karyotypes Pongo differs from the African apes (Chiarelli 1971). Kortlandt's discussion of the gracile and the robust australopithecines reveals new angles. He concludes that the robust played no role in hominid evolution. We know that gracile and robust forms also occurred among the pithecanthropines (Jacob 1973). One important thing about the book is that it tries to synthesize data obtained through different approaches and emphasizes paleogeography, paleoecology, and behavior. Differences as well as conformities in the results are of course expected, and all approaches have gaps and short- comings. In one instance, for example, a given approach has to ignore morphology to prove its point, while in another instance it has to use morphology to do so. Gaps exist not only in the fossil record, but also in archeology, paleoecology, methods in radiometric and biochemical dating, theories in Linnaean or evolutionary taxonomy, the Codes of Zoological Nomenclature, paleogeography, "paleogenetics," and even "neogenetics" of continuous morphological traits. Frequent changes in classification and shuffling back and forth of taxa do not necessarily advance the science of man; in fact, they may interfere with under- standing among non-specialists, just as excessive splitting or excessive lumping do. Multiple dendrograms reflect the existence of these many gaps, and the fierce discussions noted by Kortlandt are probably just a type of social intimidation display. Science has to move on however, and Kortlandt's book is very valuable as a cross-section of the present state of the fast-growing branch of anthropology. It keeps the primate taxonomy open and in flux, and also keeps people thinking hard. by C. OWEN LovEjoY Kent, Ohio, U.S.A. 12 i74 Kortlandt's is a novel approach to many of the current problems of human palaeontology. Although many of the points made are carefully documented and reflect his extensive experience as a primate behaviorist, a number of the conclusions drawn are, in my opinion, unlikely. While palaeogeography is an important aspect of fossil habitat reconstruction and has been given less attention than deserved by most palaeoanthropologists, there are quite restrictive limits on the utility of such data in the delineation of phylogeny. Kortlandt's discussions of African geo- morphology, while an important contribution to historical perspective on the hominid-pongid geographic dichotomy, would nonetheless appear to be insufficient grounds on which to base the actual divergence. The central issue in elucidating this divergence should remain the extensive differences in total adaptive pattern evinced by hominids and pongids, clearly observable in the adaptations of each 434 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="9">Kortlandt: APE AND HUMAN EVOLUTION (dentition, locomotor pattern, culture, social behavior, etc.). I am thus contesting Kortlandt's palaeogeographic emphasis with respect to this particular problem, not necessarily his conclusions with respect to the evidence. It is the habitat which should serve as the central theme of palaeogeographic reconstruction more than specific isolating barriers. Phyletic divergence is more often produced (among land mammals) by divergent adaptations over significantly diverse geo- graphical ranges than by singular isolating barriers. Further, some of Kortlandt's evidence fails to support his suggestion that the Rift system was an almost imperme- able barrier. The water barrier that he reconstructs was highly varied and included rivers, lakes, and swamps (p. 12). It would seem that the latter would be an ineffective barrier to an animal with so diverse a locomotor repertoire as the chimpanzee. Kortlandt points out (p. 66) the chimpanzees have relatively little difficulty in swamp condi- tions: "Watching them is extremely difficult, but their footprints show that they leap like frogs from one tussock to the next. . . . We can be certain that they also travel by the vertical clinging and leaping technique, and by brachiation. ..." The Rift would appear to have been an equally ineffective barrier to the dispersal of early hominids, since we know of at least one case (e.g., Olduvai) in which they were occupying its depths! The dendrogram proposed in figure 3, while not un- appealing, exceeds the accuracy likely from palaeogeo- graphic evidence. The separation of Asian and African dryopithecines is set within narrower limits (15-17 million years B.P.) than is possible for many of the single specimens involved. Moreover, inclusion of generation length, while clearly a requirement in the calibration of protein clocks, also introduces a variable for which there is little substantive control. We simply do not know, nor is it likely that we shall ever be able adequately to reconstruct, the generation lengths of extinct primates. When generation length is considered, the protein clock loses its capacity to yield dates any more specific than the bracketing which can be accom- plished by geological provenience. Kortlandt rejects Ramapithecus as a lineal ancestor of modern man. This position is becoming increasingly popu- lar, but his basis for it, unlike that of other recent workers, rests almost exclusively on the fossil's temporal position. If Ramapithecus is to be rejected as a hominid, in my view, it must be demonstrated that the features which differen- tiate it from other contemporary apes (thickened enamel, wear gradient, reduction of sectorial complex, anterior zygomatic position, etc.) are not sufficiently distinct to warrant definitive hominid status given the range of varia- tion of these features among contemporary dryopithecines. To reject it solely on temporal grounds would appear to be a case of fitting the specimens to the phylogeny. It is furthermore not obvious to me that Ramapithecus "must" have diverged as early as 20-25 million years B.P. Kortlandt's views are no less contrary to "prevailing opinion" with regard to the australopithecines. I find his outline for australopithecine phylogeny untenable. First, most of the differences cited between the gracile and robust allomorphs are considerably less significant then implied. The morphology of the lower limb skeleton and the gait pattern of those early hominids are similar and indicate adherence in both forms to a total morphological pattern unique among all higher primates (broad ilia, high bicondy- lar angle, high femoral neck length, low neck-shaft angle, marked lateral iliac flare with anterior pillar position and prolongation of the superior spine, etc.). The problem of brain size is also too much in flux to justify its use in the phyletic separation of graciles and robusts. The South and East African limb bone samples imply so great a range of variation in both body weight and stature that allometric normalization of brain size in both groups is highly tentative. In addition to these technical problems, there are strong theoretical objections to the proposal. Kortlandt suggests that the robust lineage evinces an adaptation to sudanian and miombo woodlands "moister than the sahelian, dry- sudanian, and mopane vegetations where the gracile was at home" (author's precis). Yet the robusts are described as being better adapted to the dry-savannah than the graciles. Such contradictions place the proposed phylogeny in some jeopardy, since its author if forced to rely on extensive parallelism to account for so ancient a separation of the two allomorphs, while the numerous and detailed similarities they exhibit must be attributed to similar envi- ronments. The proposal also erects the problem of extensive and lengthy coexistence of the two lineages. Rather than symbiosis (which Kortlandt suggests, solely on the basis of predator avoidance), character divergence would be more likely. In summary, where Kortlandt and I find our most marked disagreement is with the interpretation of the primary data, of which his phylogeny, I assume, is a direct reflection. Cited differences in the gait pattern, dentition, and degree of encephalization for the australopithecines are a case in point. Kortlandt's final chapters on the interpretation of chimpanzee behavior, however, provide grounds for clear agreement. by HENRY M. McHENRY Davis, Calif., U.S.A. 7 I 74 This is a very bold and controversial attempt to synthesize enormously diverse sources of information (e.g., geo- morphology to behavioral psychology) into one compre- hensive view of hominoid evolution. Many of the arguments are based on very speculative ideas and are forwarded in an admittedly "provocative" manner. This is especially true of the author's principal theory that speciation in hominoid evolution can be dated by the occurrence of major geological events. Kortlandt's multidisciplinary ap- proach seems to consist of arranging information from many disciplines to conform to this theory of geographical determinism. There are many problems with this kind of approach. The best example is his use of the data from molecular biology. These data have to undergo four "revi- sions" before they fit his preconceived notion of the timing of hominoid evolution. One assertion that seems particularly dubious is that the robust form of early African hominid (Paranthropus or Australopithecus robustus) emerged very early in hominoid evolution, perhaps 20 million years ago. This means that the robust form had been separated longer from the evolutionary lineage which leads to Homo than had the ancestors of chimpanzees and humans. Given the sparsity of fossils in critical time periods, the idea could be correct, but with available evidence it seems improbable. First, there is nothing in the fossil record to connect Ramapithecus exclusively with A. robustus. This connection seems to be based on pure speculation. As yet no early hominids have been found in Arabia, which is the proposed area of origin for the robust lineage. This proposition seems to stretch the geographic-isolation argument. Second, no fossil evi- dence of the robust form earlier than 3 million years has been found, and the specimens of this age are isolated teeth, difficult to classify with any reliability (Howell 1969). Third, many recent workers are proposing that the skulls and teeth of the robust and gracile early hominids are not very different, especially in South Africa (see Wolpoff 1971 for a summary). Fourth, the robust postcranial mate- Vol. 15 No. 4 December 1974 435</page><page sequence="10">rial can be interpreted very differently than in this book. Napier's (1964) assessment is the only source cited, but since 1964 many new studies have been done and new fossils have been found. Robinson (1972) has shown that many of Napier's arguments were incorrect: essentially the differences are only in the ischium, the length of the femur, and the talus. Dispute exists whether even these differences are significant for locomotor behavior (Lovejoy, Heiple, and Burstein 1973, McHenry 1972). Even given the number of differences, there is no need to complicate the picture by allowing 20 million years of separate evolution. The changes could have taken much less time. Finally, Kort- landt's argument of convergent evolution of robust and gracile forms is questionable, especially now that we have new dates on the South African sites (Partridge 1973) and Tobias's (1973) reassessment of the Makapansgat material, which leads him to believe that the separation of the robust and gracile forms took place about 3 million years ago. Of course, it is very easy for a specialist to pick apart in detail any general synthesis. Kortlandt is entirely correct in saying that an overview is needed. Isolated facts about hominoid evolution are nearly meaningless unless they are strung together into a general theory. But adherence to the facts that are known is essential. by S. C. MALIK Simla, India. 7 xii 73 A work of multidisciplinary nature which synthesises evolu- tionary studies must be applauded, especially when it gives us a behavioural approach towards the understanding of various processes in the evolution of apes and man. At the outset, Kortlandt says that the book was written for nonspecialists as well as to provoke specialists into some rethinking. If this has been the main aim, then, as a preliminary statement of his ideas, this bird's-eye view cannot be much quarrelled with. There are, of course, many points for further debate and discussion and many disagreements. Perhaps, very generally, one might object to the over-de- terministic manner of presentation. For instance, the expla- nation of the processes whereby the diversity of life has been achieved-i.e., the physical (geotectonic) processes and ecological systems that seem to be crucial preconditions and the humanoization processes that have taken place three or three and a half times during the last 25 million years-sounds as if not only were the pressures of physical and ecological systems straining toward humanoization, but there was something supernatural that made evolutionary processes lead inevitably towards the various ape-men, man-apes, sub-men, etc., and finally man-the-wise. In this context, Kortlandt too often mentions what "must" have taken place rather than what did happen. At some point, empirical evidence as a direct source of information has to support one's hypothesis or theory. This is not to deny, however, the critical importance of imagination and the adventure of ideas. Of course, Kortlandt has very ably given us various inductive arguments to support his views with regard to assessing phylogenetic affinities and differentiation and divergence. Somehow, however, his manner of presentation reminds one of the Bible, since he refers also to Genesis, Cain and Abel, etc. Perhaps it is this manner, as well as the occasional hasty treatment of a great number of factual details, that makes the hypothesis often unconvincing. A supplementary chapter showing how he has built up his multidisciplinary understanding of human and ape devel- opments might help to persuade critics of the value of these new perspectives. The task Kortlandt has undertaken is a formidable and monumental one, and his approach is undoubtedly very unusual. If the work is to persuade critics, however, I would hope that the final edition would present the results in greater detail and in an even more integrated interdisciplinary manner than does this one. At the same time, I would hope that his lucid and absorbing style of writing would not be overshadowed by too much precision and specialization. Within the limits of a 500-word review, it is impossible to be very critical, but one could dispute and question every statement, paragraph, and chapter in the book. In another sense, however, one must praise the book for its insights. It is easy for a reviewer to be critical; I have been so in the hope that these new perspectives will find a surer place in the eyes of the profession and the general public, for too many pseudo-scientific books have distorted the story of evolution that recent research insights have revealed. by BRUCE E. RAEMSCH Oneonta, N.Y., U.S.A. 26 xii 73 Kortlandt's multidisciplinary approach to the study of primate evolution is, perhaps, the most significant contri- bution of this study. I would like the dwell upon this fact in reviewing the book. No one, I think would deny the potential for new insights inherent in such a holistic study. The merit of such an approach can be critically limited, however, by the demands it makes upon the reservoir of human knowledge as it is often limited in the individual with wide interests. It may prove impossible for any one person to bring to bear upon the problem all the facts necessary for a correct answer. If we presume, on the other hand, that such difficulty can be avoided, interpretation of the facts gathered through the multidisciplinary approach presents another problem to which each of us is heir. This problem is related to the conditioning effect that simplistic 19th-century evolu- tionary thought still has upon our thinking. Kortlandt's (p. 71) phrase "fitting together the spare parts [to find] that the gracile [australopithecines] descended from Dryopithecus africanus in East-Africa and the robust ones from Ramapithecus in Arabia," while providing for a bi- phyletic descent, seems to provide new energy for the missing-link concept and a biologic reduction to the simple "tree of life." Thus, the so-called multidisciplinary approach has so far resulted not so much in a new perspective as in a new appreciation of the complexities of a basic problem (p. 76). A multidisciplinary approach certainly will contribute insights into man's evolution, but this approach cannot omit such problems as the unresolved presence of Homo sapiens-related remains so close in time to the presumed antecedents of man (i.e., the gracile australopithecines). There still seems too little time to allow for the descent of the former from the latter. The Kanjera and Vertesszoll6s fossils, to name but two, illustrate this problem, but now new evidence, in the form of core-flake industries, from Pleistocene sediments of the New World opens up further difficulties. Any multidisciplinary method must be very broadly based, but it must contribute in- depth also. Kortlandt, recognizing the needs, has contributed to a good beginning. by ABHIMANYU SHARMA Delhi, India. 16 I 74 Kortlandt's major contribution lies in pp. 9-36, where the palaeogeographic, zoogeographic, and palaeoecologic scheme is convincingly supported by "sophisticated bio- 436 C U R R E N T A N T H R O P O L O G Y</page><page sequence="11">Kortlandt: APE AND HUMAN EVOLUTION chemical taxonomy and dating" (p. 36) and rift-geologic researches. But I have my reservations on the "Ramapithe- cus-Kenyapithecus" and "gracile-robust" problems. I am not shocked "to find two apes among the family of man" (p. 17), but do we have the kind of fossil evidence needed to support such a deduction? The postulation of "a more or less continuous rain forest" to explain the "canopy-dwelling" and "semi-terrestrial" differences in life- style is illogical (longitudinal and latitudinal differences seem to have been ignored!) and is not backed by the requisite evidence from Arabia (pp. 16-17). Again, why does Kortlandt support a monogenic speciation pattern for all apes, when the great variability of dryopithecines is a sure sign of regional isolation under selective pressures that differ in different parts of the globe? The clear parallel lies in man's having spread as Homo erectus before evolving into the different varieties of man we see today; Kortlandt is seemingly conscious of this, as he quotes Simons's belief that "man evolved simultaneously in Asia and Africa" (p. 37). The continuity of ecosystems ("forest connections") implies an unwarranted faith in the unitary origin-cum- development of all apes. Beadnell (1948) was one of the first to mention the orang as apart from the "gorilla- chimpanzee complex," so there is nothing original about this claim (pp. 11, 17). Obviously, "barriers" cause selective pressures towards species differentiation, since mating patterns on an inter- specific plane are basically affected; descending from trees to adopt terrestrial ways leads to enlargement of the food area, increased mobility and bipedality, increase in mating choice, and frequent crossing of members of originally widely separated groups, leading to a breakdown of mating barriers between localised varieties and increased variability of the merged group (Washburn 1951). The same would occur when forests and bush-savannas disappear as barriers. And Kortlandt is conscious of these "selective pressures" when he talks of "leveling off the decelerating factor" (p. 35). Finally, if the contention that "the Dryopithecines . . . branched off much earlier" (p. 20) is correct, the existing differences between "brachiationists" and "anti-brachia- tionists" (Brodrick 1960, Breitinger 1959) disappear almost entirely. "The total absence of any apes in the eastern and south- ern part of the continent" (p. 23) is true today, but cannot be asserted for Mio-Pliocene times; Kortlandt realizes the weakness of this argument when he says (p. 24) that "during the Middle and Late Miocene . . . East Africa was teeming with Dryopithecine apes." Different species are known to share an ecological niche, and vice versa. Kortlandt writes (p. 24): ". . . that one or two species [italics mine] of them adapted themselves to the progressive drought . . . and became Australopithecines . . . deserves serious consider- ation." Couldn't these one or two species have belonged to the Ramapithecus-Kenyapithecus complex? Their inter- pretation is long overdue, and the march of science cannot always await the imaginary fossil find that would represent "completeness"; this seems particularly true when we read that "the Australopithecines evolved from a member of the Dryopithecinae stock located east of the Nile-Zambezi barriers . . . from 14 to 5 million years ago" and that "one tooth . . . about 10 m.y. old suggests a transitional creature between an ape and an Australopithecinae" (p. 25). If Kortlandt is unable to place Ramapithecus-Kenyapithecus in his "phylogenetic dendrogram" (p. 37), this should not become an excuse for denying them an ecologic niche in the Siwaliks or East Africa, and the creation of an Arabian niche is shocking in the absence there of even a single tooth. Not stopping here, Kortlandt jumps from one assumption to another like a trapeze artist. On the one hand, he assigns "the mother of the Ramapithecus baby" to Arabia (pp. 37-40) and holds that "Arabia during Early to Middle Miocene times [was] a suitable ecological niche for a man-ape or ape-man," clearly implying an indepen- dent development. On the other, he apparently believes that Propliopithecus is the "common ancestor" of "Aeolopithecus-Hylobatid" and "Aeolopithecus-Dryopithe- cid" lines (p. 32). This leads us to only two possibilities: either (a) Kenyapithecus is an independent development in East Africa from Propliopithecus but has nothing to do with the primates before or after him there, or (b) contrary to Kortlandt's hypothesis that there is no place for Ramapithecus in the human lineage, Kenyapithecus is de- scended from the hypothetical Arabian "mother" of the Ramapithecus-Kenyapithecus complex. Absence of any men- tion of the first possibility seems to me like sweeping the dust under the carpet. Ramapithecus could certainly be assigned a place, at least tentatively, between the 26-million- year and 15-million-year points, as a fitting recognition of the proximity of the Ramapithecus-Kenyapithecus line to the orang on the one hand and the gorilla-chimp-man on the other. Appending a question mark (?) will take care of the need for caution due to the paucity of material for interpretation. It is questionable that "humanity," in the sense of ances- tors of hominids, "emerged thrice on our planet" (p. 41) without any evidence from Arabia; the Olduvai Gorge indicates that primordial "humanity" as H. erectus appeared only once. Despite Chopra's (1973) repeatedly pointing out more traits as pongid than hominid in the mandible christened Gigantopithecus bilaspurensis-relatively small- sized! -Kortlandt is not to blame, in view of the stereotype of an ape, for classing both Ramapithecus and Gigantopithecus as "humanoid apes" (p. 41)/"great apes" (p. 70), the work of Schultz and Clark indicating a vast intrageneric diversity of primates notwithstanding. Kortlandt, quoting Jolly (1970a), argues that Ramapithecus and Gigantopithecus were not "hominids" (p. 57), and yet they are supposed to have had "more advanced levels of mental communication than our chimp relatives" (p. 41). "A greater resemblance to the human" than to the ape has been seen in Ramapithecus's upper dentition (Von Koenigswald 1958; cf. Howells 1962). "Systematic judgments will rest on the pelvis" (Breitinger 1959) and on the long bones and foot bones. The "robust vs. gracile problem" (p. 53) is an artificial one, mainly of semantics. How robust and gracile types can be viewed as two different lines despite the Oldowan Bed I finds is beyond me. How can the two be supposed to have diverged very early in time when it is known that both pedomorphic and gerontomorphic types exist in the same Mendelian human populations today (Tobias 1959)? The hyper-robust and ultra-gracile types of Bed I are supposed to show narrowed differences with the passage of time, as indeed is the case with the later group of australopithecines from South Africa as contrasted with the early australopithecines if only we keep in mind that each succeeding primate radiation is less variable than the one preceding it (Washburn 1951). The same could be applied to the hominid complex. Some contradictions: (1) Gigantopithecus has been re- ferred to both as a "humanoid" (p. 28) and as "great apes" (p. 70), "humanoid" having been used in the sense of "nascent hominids" (p. 40), "human-like" (p. 71), or as having "advanced" features in contrast to "primitive" (apish) (pp. 46, 58). (2) "Two successive attempts were made to create human beings of a sort"-"the humanoization of the robust branch" and "the humanization of the gracile lineage . . . during the Plio-Pleistocene." Wasn't there a Vol. 15 * No. 4 Decemrber 1974 437</page><page sequence="12">third attempt when Kortlandt speaks of Ramapithecus as "a serious candidate for human ancestry"? And yet a fourth attempt in the Oligocene (pp. 65, 66)? However, the one to succeed was the hominids. by B. A. SIGMON Toronto, Canada. 7 ii 74 One has to admire the gigantic mental effort involved in the writing of this book. Yet on the same account, the author's multidisciplinary approach attempts to encompass so many fields that predictably the book falls short of his goals. The endeavor to assimilate large bodies of data from many fields lends itself to difficulties apparent throughout the book. One of these difficulties is that some aspects of an issue may be neglected while others are highlighted, resulting in partial or superficial coverage of an event. Another difficulty is that each of the fields involved is constantly updating its knowledge; drawing too tight a palaeontological conclusion may lead to problems if, for example, geological events turn out to be different than previously supposed. The following are some examples of what I consider to be weak arguments or untimely conclusions: 1. Kortlandt's inclusion of the African apes in the family Hominidae is based on his hypothesis that hominines and African apes diverged phylogenetically from dryopithecine ancestors about 14 million years ago because of geographical isolation caused by major rifting in East Africa. Even if this hypothesis proves correct, one cannot neglect, as the author does, looking at events that occurred after the divergence of the evolutionary lineages. Subsequent changes in morphology, diet, locomotion, and mentality in the two lineages are regarded by most people as providing more than sufficient taxonomic justification for the familial separation of African apes and hominines. 2. Chapter 3 as a whole produces the impression that with the correct juggling of numbers and formulae, one can arrive at the figures (or dates) one had more or less anticipated anyway. The explanation for the derivation of the formula 30V.3 is especially vague. Some additional explanation defining use of procedures should be included in this chapter. 3. It was surprising to read (p. 25) that the reason the early hominines never established a firm footing in the territory occupied by the African apes is that "it was too hostile for them . . . and they were no match for chimps, gorillas, or any other large semi-terrestrial apes, just as any man without a spear or firearm is today." Does this statement not contradict the ethological findings of Schaller, Goodall, and others? 4. The inclusion of Paranthropus as a descendent of Ramapithecus is based on a superficial morphological com- parison. For example, the author points out that both forms have reduced anterior dentition. He neglects to point out contrasting morphological features such as wear patterns or the size relationship between anterior and posterior dentition. In my opinion, he has not presented a convincing case for an ancestor-descendent relationship between Ramapithecus and Paranthropus. 5. The idea that Ramapithecus originated in Arabia will probably have to undergo revision because of recent work done in the Red Sea area, where the date of formation of the Red Sea graben, previously given as 26 million years ago, has been pushed back to 34-41 million years ago (Girdler and Styles 1974). This sort of occurrence in the geological literature is certain to be an affliction that the author will be pressed to face time and again. Certainly, fields other than palaeontology have their several inter- pretations of events, and as certainly these interpretations will change and be updated with the accumulation of new facts. In general, the author tends to build on assumptions, moving along a supposed chain of events. One weak link causes the formulations to collapse, forcing a rebuilding and refashioning of the chain. I am, however, very glad to see someone attempt a study of this nature. It is the sort of book which lends itself to criticism from many fields, yet it is extremely valuable as a broad paradigm for further research into hominid evolution. by YUKIMARU SUGIYAMA Inuyama, Japan. 31 xii 73 1. Geographic isolation under a diversity of environ- ments and habitats is the only form of speciation among higher animals. The point of view of Kortlandt's compre- hensive study is certainly correct, although the task is a most difficult one. Comparative studies on the evolution and phyletic relations of living and fossil primates from anatomy, biochemistry, genetics, behavior study, ecology, and other fields must be verified by palaeogeography and geology, as we have no decisive approach at present for tracing the human lineage. Thus the author's desperate effort to tell the spectacular story of human genesis, challenging the results of past scientific study, should be highly appreciated. The great rift-valleys may have served as barriers dividing the African continent into parts and leading to the geo- graphic isolation of hominoid ancestors. However, we need more detailed evidence from palaeogeography to prove that they worked as barriers for quite a long time. 2. Although none of us can declare that the factors which produced the biochemical phyletic tree are absolutely free from natural selection, they must be comparatively neutral to it. Thus the fact that the biochemical datings of diver- gence times of the main branches of the anthropoid stocks and those of palaeontology come out almost the same after revisions suggests that we cannot now put the chimpanzee and the gorilla with the orangutan into a single family, the Pongidae. However, there remains the problem whether the chimpanzee, the gorilla, and man can be grouped in the Hominidae, as the author argues, or must be divided into two families. 3. The author suggests (p. 18) that Proconsul was eurotopic, adapted to an array of habitats, because its arm bone resembles thalt of the langurs of South Asia (Presbytis entellus). It may be accepted that a gracile arm bone may prove that its owner was not a specialized brachiator. However, the fact that Presbytis entellus, a kind of anatomi- cally rather specialized Colobinae, is the most eurotopic of all living anthropoids does not justify the conclusion that Proconsul was a eurotopic species and "represents something like a grossly oversized langur monkey" only from the resemblance of arm bones. Ecological and behav- ioral study of the adaptability to environments of Presbytis entellus, which spends several months of the dry season in a hot, dry area without drinking water in South India (Sugiyama 1964) and does as well for several months of winter in heavy snow, feeding on conifer seeds and bark, in the highest forests of the Himalayas (my unpublished data) as it does in the temperate rich forest, may offer more important data for reconstructing the life-style and adaptability of fossil primates than the author expects. by FREDERICK S. SZALAY New York, N. Y., U.S.A. 20 XII 73 At the outset, Kortlandt states that his effort at synthesis centers on hominoid phylogeny and the adaptational aspects 438 C U R R E N T A N T H R O P O L O G Y</page><page sequence="13">Kortlandt: APE AND HUMAN EVOLUTION of this evolutionary history. Yet, the conceptually pivotal area of the methods and nitty-gritty procedures of con- structing theories of relationships, on the one hand, and inferring adaptations from the paleontological evidence, on the other, seems to be the least well understood by him of all the various disciplines into which he has so bravely ventured. The author displays a serious lack of understanding of systematic biology. The concepts of tax- onomy, phylogeny, and classification form an undifferen- tiated amalgam in his text, and these distinctive terms (for equally distinctive areas of scientific operations) are used as if they were synonymous. After statements to the effect that he is the synthesizer of hominoid evolution who is not "distracted by irrelevant detail," Kortlandt proceeds to sidestep the relevant facts and methods of analysis that have yielded solid answers in hominoid evolutionary studies. The book is full of self-praise for his past "prophetic" utterances, a particularly touchy matter in a field such as "hominoidology," where most topics have been speculated on a number of times and every paleoanthropologist, professional and amateur alike, can be proud of one or two hypotheses of his own. It is mesmerizing to observe Kortlandt choosing, reject- ing, offering, and fabricating hypotheses and subhypotheses with the arbitrary authority of a feudal lord. The section on Ramapithecus is symptomatic of his approach to evidence. Nowhere does he discuss the morphological facts on which hypotheses might be based. The cart comes before the horse, and the reader is swept away by ready answers from a priori ecological and theoretical considerations. Like many other anthropologists, Kortlandt apparently also accepts (p. 25) Jolly's hypothesis of the convergence of the early hominid feeding mechanism with that of geladas, which are, like kangaroos, for example, specialized graminivores. Again, he sidesteps the evidence, a reanalysis of which does not support the noted convergence of either the morphology, the mechanical function, or, clearly, therefore, the biological role of the feeding mechanism of the hominid morphotype. This author's tentative inference (p. 40) that "humanoids of some sort evolved independently three times on Earth" is interesting. What is a humanoid? An ill-understood morphology of differently modified hominoid feeding mechanisms? Kortlandt's summation, beginning on p. 71, of his view of hominid evolution is so sweepingly and blatantly contemptuous of crucial details of data, inductive reasoning, and, in general, the conceptual methodologies of the various subdisciplines he reviews that detailed com- ments on it would require a book-length review. His paper is no landmark synthesis of hominid evolution! by RUSSELL H. TurrLE Chicago, Ill., U.S.A. 17 I 74 This "new" synthetic perspective on hominoid evolution, like most of its predecessors and contemporaries, unevenly treats the variety of pertinent evidence. Kortlandt stresses conjectural paleogeographic and more substantial biomo- lecular features instead of the hard evidence that is the stock-in-trade of traditional physical anthropology and paleontology. He also conveys impressions derived from his extensive ethological and first-hand natural-historical experiences with chimpanzees and other large mammals, and herein is the essay's major value. Although sometimes naive about aspects of evolutionary biology outside his own experience, Kortlandt has produced a stimulating comment on ape and human careers that should be taken into account by future theoreticians. Among the most serious inadequa- cies of the piece are the few anatomically premised discus- sions and the omission of thorough comparisons with the hypotheses of other workers in this active field. It is important to convey to "nonspecialists" the diversity of tenable ideas on the mechanisms of hominid emergence. Kortlandt might again consult the classic literature on the natural history of pongid apes when he revises the text. He describes orangutans as grasping even the thickest branches during quadrupedal progression atop large branches (p. 16), but Wallace (1962) described an orangutan walking on its "knuckles" on branches. Without thoroughly analyzing the possible role of sus- pensory behavior as precedent to knuckle-walking in Afri- can apes, Kortlandt (pp. 15-16) advances the hypothesis that "the real advantage of knuckle-walking is that it elevates the animal on the ground an additional 15 to 20 cm as compared to plantigrade gait, so that the ape obtains a better view over the savanna grasses and can run faster. Moreover, knuckle-walking prevents the development of callosities on the inner sides of the hands, which would hamper climbing." This argument is not compelling. I see knuckle-walking as best explained in terms of the secondary adaptation for terrestrial locomotion of long-fingered, flexible hands that were rather advanced for forelimb suspensory behavior (i.e., climbing vertically and hauling, hoisting, and bridging, as well as arm-swinging beneath branches in the canopy). A pattern of ventral digitigrady with additional lengthening of the long bones in the forelimb would have served the same functions in early terrestrial apes (as it did in monkeys that ventured to the ground) had they not had a well-developed suspensory adaptive complex. In regard to the potential problem of callosity development, it should be noted that several lineages of monkeys have become quite terrestrial without having their climbing abilities hampered unduly by cal- loused hands. I applaud Kortlandt's comments on the ingenuity of orangutans, but his references to "degenerate" and "drop- out" gorillas (p. 16) are misleading, especially to the nonspecialist. There is virtually no evidence in the fossil record to support the idea that Paranthropus was a knuckle-walker (p. 62). Indeed, the few bits of direct evidence, viz., distal metacarpal bones, show that the morphological pattern characteristic of knuckle-walking African apes was not present in Paranthropus (Robinson 1972:206). Morphological evidence from extant hominoids is quite compatible with the timetable elaborated by Kortlandt. It is the fossil "dental apes" that are at greatest variance with current biomolecular models. While there are merits to both paleontological and biomolecular views, my sympathies are somewhat closer to Kortlandt's dates for divergence of man and the African apes than to those advanced by the extreme paleontological parallelists of the Yale school. But despite the overwhelming biomolecular evidence, I still have difficulty envisioning nearly synchronous diver- gence of chimpanzee, gorilla, and man instead of a more extensive common ancestry in the African apes with an earlier furcation of the hominid lineage from it. Finally, it seems quite reasonable now to place the few bits of Ramapithecus back in their display cases and search for additional, more complete remains. However, I doubt that champions of its hominid status will permit Ramapithe- cus to wander without sustenance and issue on the Arabian Peninsula until it can be comfortably accommodated under the tent of empiricism. by RICHARD G. WILKINSON Albany, N.Y., U.S.A. 3 I 74 In an admittedly preliminary edition, Kortlandt has taken a shotgun approach to the study of early hominid (human- Vol. 15 No. 4 December 1974 439</page><page sequence="14">oid?) evolution. By attempting to cover a vast amount of material in a very few pages, he touches briefly on a wide variety of subjects, many of which could use a fuller discussion. The book would profit from being either greatly expanded to cover the topic more adequately or condensed to concentrate on a single area. Kortlandt's major thesis-a trigenic origin of human- oids-is certainly provocative and, like others, deserves serious consideration. Evolutionary convergence, used to account for the morphological differences and similarities between robust and gracile australopithecines, is a powerful explanatory device, especially when combined with Jolly's (1970) seed-eating model. The eventual usefulness of such a scheme depends on the assumptions made relative to the dating of the South African material. Some such assumptions are basic to almost all hypotheses dealing with early hominid evolution and ought to be made explicit. While I see a place for Kortlandt's hypotheses, I have some reservations about the manner of presentation, and I question some of the statements made in defense of his ideas. The approach is essentially one of trying to persuade the reader that the truth has finally been found. This is a common approach, but I suggest that it is time for a change. While human paleontologists and evolutionists may be expected to champion their causes, the extent of the confusion such chauvinism has produced is perhaps most obvious when we are trying to explain the situation to students. Kortlandt's use of biochemical taxonomy is a good exam- ple of this truth-finding. Biochemical taxonomy is seen as "sound" and "classical" taxonomy as "unreliable" because of the consistency of the results of the former and the lack thereof in the "classical" approach (p. 31). Presumably, biochemical taxonomy has more "truth," despite its being based on a rather formidable array of assumptions (Lovejoy and Meindl 1973). The omniscience of the test tube is once again being assumed. The statement that bone from South African sites succeeds in "proving that the gracile type actually made hunting weapons" (p. 48) is another example of dubious fact-finding. Dart's evidence hardly proves that a particular hominid made the implements or that the implements were hunting weapons. Biochemical taxonomy and osteodontokeratic implements must be con- sidered, but they have not yet acquired the status of truths. Kortlandt's work raises a number of questions, many of which might be answered in an expanded version of the book. The alleged predator-prey relationship between Eurasian Mio-Pliocene bears and dryopithecines (p. 20) is interesting, but what is the evidence for the coexistence of bears and apes and for extensive predation? Why were Early Pleistocene hominines "no match for chimps, gorillas" (p. 25) when these hominines had survived in the midst of large savanna predators for eons? Why is geographic speciation the only type found among higher animals? Can the "competitive exclusion principle" really be applied to the relationship between Jews and Nazis (p. 74)? The claim that Robinson's was "a voice crying in the wilderness" (p. 55) surprised me, since Robinson's views have been widely accepted, at least among American physi- cal anthropologists. The hypothesis of an Arabian birthplace for the "Rama apes" needs extensive bolstering, especially since it is supported only by negative evidence. I am not convinced that such an isolated homeland is necessary to explain the alleged seed-eating propensities of Ramapithecus or that later hominids had to be geographically isolated by rivers and rifts. Perhaps a stronger argument could be made on the basis of sympatric speciation. Finally, I note with dismay the following phrase, which should require no comment: "With an amount of patience and persever- ance that only a woman can possess . . ." (p. 76). by HELMUTH ZAPFE Vienna, Austria. 6 I 74 The author is a zoologist and a well-known ethologist. It is rare for a researcher in these fields to deal so thoroughly with geological and paleogeographical problems. There- fore, his book is especially remarkable. The author attaches great importance to barriers that could not be crossed by apes, but it seems not certain that the Miocene apes-like their recent relatives-could not swim. Because of their more monkey-like body propor- tions, it is possible that the dryopithecines could swim like some recent monkeys. The same is true of the Miocene hylobatids (e.g., Limnopithecus), which did not yet move "swinging from tree crown to tree crown" in the manner of the gibbons but were semiterrestrial. Under these cir- cumstances, it seems somewhat daring to exdude such a semiterrestrial ancestor of the orang without any paleonto- logical evidence. Paleogeographical maps of Europe in the Middle Miocene show a very complicated picture of bays and straits, lakes, swamps, and rivers. Nevertheless, in the beginning of the Middle Miocene, Dryopithecus and Pliopithecus were able to settle nearly all of Europe within a short time. For the ancestors of the platyrrhines, the assumption is inevitable that they arrived in South America by sea; they descend either from North American omomyids that immigrated as "island hoppers" during the Lower Tertiary (Simpson 1950) or from an African ancestor group common with the catarrhines that drifted (on logs, etc.) across the Atlantic from West Africa, a much shorter distance in the Lower Tertiary (Hofstetter 1954). Further- more, one should consider that not only the Primates, but also many other mammal groups (Proboscidea, Hyracoidea, Giraffidae, Hippopotamidae, Tubulidentata), began in the Upper Tertiary to spread from Africa as far as Europe and Eurasia. Of these, the hippopotami seem the least capable of wandering far, but they had reached Germany and Southeast Asia by the Pleistocene. When geological periods are available, the impassability of topographical barriers seems problematic and somewhat overestimated. Concerning the interesting hypothesis of the origin of Ramapithecus in Arabia, it should be noted that this primate was also able to reach East Africa and India during the Miocene (when Kenyapithecus-Ramapithecus?). The scarcity of primate finds depends not only on the intensity of research, but also on fossilisation. Forests and plains are unfavourable for fossilisation, and the fact that primates need less water than many ungulates decreases the proba- bility of their preservation in aquatic deposits. The interest- ing thought that the evolution starting from Ramapithecus should end with Paranthropusin a blind alley is disappointing in that the immediate origin of Homo in the Late Tertiary is lost again. The author's opinion on Oreopithecus is conformable to that of many paleontologists. Marginally, it should be noted that the "osteodontokeratic culture" is problematic and a natural origin of such objects has been suggested. The author's often novel approach to the phylogeny of man and the great apes will be stimulating for future research, but many problems can finally be solved only by sufficient paleontological documentation. Reply by ADRIAAN KORTLANDT Amsterdam, The Netherlands. 16 IV 74 I am grateful that, in spite of the controversial nature of the subjects treated in my book, most of my critics 440 C U R R E N T A N T H R O P O L O G Y</page><page sequence="15">Kortlandt: APE AND HUMAN EVOLUTION appreciated both the attempt to arrive at a multidisciplinary synthesis and the presentation of the subject matter. Writing such a study, and doing so in a foreign language, is in some respects a rather masochistic exercise, but at the same time it is a great intellectual adventure. I have deliberately tried to convey to the nonspecialist reader the enjoyment of the "trapeze artist" (Sharma) in "rebuilding and refash- ioning" the chain of events (Sigmon) and "choosing, reject- ing, offering, and fabricating hypotheses and subhypoth- eses" (Szalay). Even the fiercest of my critics, Szalay, recognizes this "mesmerizing" aspect of the job which fascinated me so much. Quite another aspect is the question of whether or not ''any attempt at a full summary at this time is premature" (Delson), or, even worse, whether or not "it may prove impossible for any one person to bring to bear upon the problem all the facts necessary for a correct answer" (Raemsch). I think it may be wise to postpone the updating of my book until all the new datings from South Africa have been published. Apart from that, however, as long as science moves on, any attempt at a summary of the current state of research will always be in a sense "prema- ture." Nevertheless, such a balance sheet can be heuristically useful and provide new guidelines for future efforts. Science is, after all, more than mere bookkeeping of factual data. Furthermore, while the hypothesis of today may or may not become the truth of tomorrow, it will inevitably become the error of the day after. Having said this, I will now proceed to some factual topics raised in the reviews. 1. The impassability of barriers. Blumenberg and Todd, Butzer, Lovejoy, Sugiyama, and Zapfe have doubts about the effectiveness of the faunal barriers I have proposed. Such doubts are justified, of course. During a time-span of millions of years, populations of apes may have crossed the major rivers and swamps many thousands of times. Two aspects should, however, be kept in mind here: (a) Barriers always tend to exert a sweepstake effect; some taxa of plants and animals cross, others do not, and in many cases no one understands precisely why. Once a barrier exists, however, it tends to be self-sustaining, because the ecosystems on the two sides tend to diverge, both florally and faunally. This is illustrated, e.g., by the differences that exist among the butterflies on the two sides of the Eastern Rift in the Nairobi area and other rifts even though these creatures may easily fly or be blown across the rift valleys (Carcasson 1964). The same principle applies equally to other parts of the African Rift system and to the large river drainage systems. The Niger and Sassandra rivers, for example, are floristic barriers for the rain-forest vegeta- tion (see, among others, Guillaumet 1967, Richards 1963). Thus Butzer's argument based on the (alleged) sedimentary break between the Kisegi and Kaiso formations is invalid, at least if we assume that the Rift Valley and the drainage system continued to exist. (b) The African Rift system is for most of its length a double system, and it is comple- mented by the Lower Nile. Furthermore, the Western Rift consists, along most of its length, of two river, lake, and swamp barriers and two arid zones, one in the Rift Valley and one to the east of it. If a group of apes could cross one barrier, there would still be another one ahead. No regular gene flow would be possible, and speciation would be inevitable. Similarly, if the Benue and Chad drainage systems once had their oudlet through the Cross River, or if the Chad system had its oudlet through the Sanaga or the Congo River, there would also have been a double barrier between West and Central Africa. Lovejoy, in arguing against the impermeability of the Rift barrier system, mentions chimpanzee locomotion in swamp forests. Normally, however, a swamp consists of several vegetation zones. No contemporary ape can cross the papyrus and reed zones or the lake in the middle. The absence of gorillas on the Ruwenzori Mountains, in spite of their presence in the Kayonsa Forest (Kigezi), illustrates the importance of even a minuscule water barrier. Zapfe points out, however, that the dryopithecines may have been able to swim and that, at any rate, they dispersed quite rapidly all over southern Asia and Europe in Middle Miocene times. With our present knowledge of dryopithe- cine anatomy and European paleogeography, it seems worthwhile to tackle this problem. 2. Ecosystems and speciation. I agree in part with Lovejoy's statement that "the habitat . . . should serve as the central theme of palaeogeographic reconstruction more than spe- cific isolating barriers." Both aspects are, of course, equally important. Neglecting one of them would be comparable to explaining water and omitting either the H2 or the 0. That is why I have given equal attention to both. However, among chimpanzees, significandy, the present-day (sub) speciating barriers are constituted by the main rivers and not by vegetation boundaries. Much the same rule applies to the monkeys, the gibbons, and other mammals that are poor swimmers (Booth 1957; Dandelot 1965; Groves 1972; Rahm 1962, 1972). The dictum that speciation is determined by isolating geographical barriers is not my "naive fundamental scien- tific philosophy" (Blumenberg and Todd). Nor is it a Law of Nature. Rather, it is a general zoological rule which may be considered valid for African ape and early human evolution because (a) our contemporary African apes and hominids are long-distance walkers, (b) their communities are fairly open to strangers from neighbouring groups, and (c) the apes, at any rate, are highly promiscuous. Consequently, genes could travel, within a few millennia, from the Niger River to the Rift Valley, and from the evergreen rain forest to the driest sudanian woodlands, before the advent of agriculture at least. 3. Paleoclimates, paleovegetations, and locomotion. Butzer, Curry-Lindahl, and I seem to agree that the present-day Saharo-Arabian zone, or at least the northern part of it, has been relatively arid since the Burdigalian. This is contrary to a rather widespread belief in a Sahara once lush and green with forests. (Butzer overlooks the fact that, in my figure 17, Aegyptopithecus is characterized as inhabiting predominantly dense, but also broken, forest in the Fayum.) The problem now is how the ancestors of the orangutan ever reached Asia. I myself cannot find, in orangutan behaviour, any traces of former semi-ground- dwelling habits or regular terrestrial locomotion; e.g., there are no fixed patterns of terrestrial gait among them, with the possible exception of the peculiar downslope crutch- walking technique, which also occurs occasionally in chimpanzees (van Lawick-Goodall 1968, MacKinnon 1971, Nissen 1931). Now we must choose which path to follow. One possibility is to postulate (as I did in the book) a continuous rain-forest connection from Africa to Asia in Early Burdigalian times, probably running through south- ern Arabia, because in those days the Tethys Sea was still wide enough and the Asian Taurus Mountains still low enough to allow for sufficient rains in the southern part of the Arabian subcontinent. This assumption is supported by the abundance of Miocene fluviatile and lacustrine deposits in southern and eastern Arabia (Powers et al. 1966), which indicates a much wetter climate in that part of Arabia than Butzer supposes. The alternative is to postulate, as Zapfe apparendy does, that the orangutan lineage had a semiterrestrial Early Miocene ancestor whose ground- dwelling adaptations have long since disappeared from Vol. 15 No. 4 December 1974 441</page><page sequence="16">view. I would accept Zapfe's suggestion if it were true that orangutans knuckle-walk or fist-walk on thick branches, as Tutde infers from Wallace. From Wallace's account, however, I presume that he refers to terrestrial walking in captivity. To my knowledge, none of our contemporary orang-watchers has ever observed knuckle-walking or fist- walking among orangs in the canopy. An intriguing question is to what extent the apparent desiccation of tropical Africa during the Mio-Pliocene was a real climatic phenomenon, and to what extent it should be attributed to the destruction of vegetation by the evolving bulldozer herbivores, particularly the elephants, in an epoch before spear-wielding hunters kept them under control. I agree with Curry-Lindahl that elephants cannot destroy a continuous rain forest in the evergreen forest belt, but in the Ivory Coast I have seen a case in which elephants had considerably opened up such a forest by destroying many young trees (see also Guillaumet 1967:105). Further- more, in the semideciduous rain-forest belt, elephants can actually obliterate entire patches of forest in a forest-savanna mosaic landscape (cf. the Djugu, Rabondo, and Wairingo Forests in Zaire and Uganda). Thus a geographic shift of the natural vegetation belts due to the action of pachy- derms is very feasible. With regard to the South African paleoclimates and habitats of ape-men, Butzer's comment that the cave sedi- ments are "compatible only with an incomplete mat of vegetation and an environment comparable to or drier than that of today," characterized by "an open regional vegetation, possibly punctuated by trees in sinkholes and valley bottoms," appears substantially to differ from his statement (1971:1199-1200) that "the vegetation mat was, at times, incomplete, and . . . high-intensity rains were no less common than today," while "at or near each of the sites karstic pools, seeps, or springs were probably available in early prehistoric times, providing sources of water for hominids and other animals, and presumably favoring a more luxuriant plant cover at the local level." Moreover, I cannot imagine how the ape-men could ever have survived in "fairly uniform grassland settings" (Butzer 1971) if the sinkholes and valley bottoms were at most only "punctuated" by trees, in a country teeming with carnivores. Furthermore, if it turns out that Brain's (1958) sedimentological analysis does not give an adequate picture of the ape-men's habitats, the arguments based on the dentitions and the accompanying faunas still remain valid. Maier's (1973) faunal analysis of Makapansgat demonstrates a highly diversified parklike habitat. I am eagerly awaiting publication of the full data by Butzer and others. 4. Dating the barriers. I admit to Butzer, Lovejoy, and Sigmon that the apparent precision with which I tried to date the points at which the faunal barriers became forbid- ding is rather deceptive. One reason is that dendrograms provide, typographically, no room for a margin of uncer- tainty. Apart from that, new stratigraphic determinations may sometimes lead to rather dramatic revisions. A case in point is Gautier's (1965) designation of the beginning of the Sinda Bed B and Nyamavi Bed IV formations as early or middle Upper Miocene, which I translated as "14 ? 2 million years ago." Since the Sinda swamp, with its many crocodiles, seemed to be the most perfect faunal barrier to hominoids one could imagine, I proposed this dating for the ape-human divergence instead of my earlier dating, based upon the knowledge of Rift geology then available, at "about 5 to 7 million years ago" (Kortlandt 1965, 1968). I did not then know that Gautier's view was inconsistent with Hooijer's (1963, 1966) work on the Rift mammals. Nor did I know that, in the meantime, Gautier (1970), Hooijer (1970), and Lepersonne (1970) had revised their concepts of Western Rift chronostratigraphy and that the Sinda Beds had been recorre1ated with the ?Villafran- chian lower part of the Kaiso Formation. (It turned out that the previous stratigraphic confusion was partly due to a labelling error in earlier fieldwork!) With the knowledge now at hand, I would tentatively date the beginning of the faunal barrier to apes at the top of the Passage Beds and the base of the Sinda Beds-Kaiso Formation, i.e., when the turbulent period of Rift formation ended and swamp formation started. An earlier stratigraphic date, however, is also possible. Even if this issue were settled, another problem would remain: the apparent absence of "Pliocene" land-mammal fossils in the Western Rift area, in spite of an apparently continuous sedimentation from the "Miocene" to the "Villa- franchian." Let me quote Gautier (1970:76): "Well defined 'Pliocene' mammalian stages seem to be unknown in East Africa. One may ask whether the accepted mammalian stages do not cover longer periods than accepted nowadays. In the author's opinion, . . . it seems wise to suspend judgement. More data are required." Thus the reevaluation of the factual data has led to a loss of apparent precision. Since then, however, Bishop (1972), especially, has started to produce the chronostratigraphic data Gautier asks for. The ambiguity may soon be resolved. I hope that the present discussion will stimulate scientific curiosity on this crucial issue. The new chronostratigraphic datings from South Africa imply that my tentative outline of the course of events on that subcontinent requires some revision, but it is still too early to state what precisely should be revised. We now know that the Langebaanweg Horizons 1 and 2 and the Oldest Vaal Gravels antedate hominid stone-tool manufac- turing (Butzer et al. 1973, Hendey 1970). The absence of artefacts in these deposits therefore does not exclude the possibility that osteodontokeratic implements or aus- tralopithecine remains may someday be found. The redat- ing of the Sterkfontein Extension and Swartkrans deposits at about 1 1 to 2 million years (based on faunal correlation; Cooke 1972, Cooke and Maglio 1972) reduces the time-span in my proposition that the Congo-Mweru, Zambezi, and Limpopo barriers delayed the immigration of " Tel- anthropus" and "Paranthropus" into South Africa for about 12 million years to a time-span of about 2 to 1 million years. The argument is not invalidated, but it has become quantitatively less convincing. (See, however, Tobias 1973 on specimens with presumed robust affinities in the Makapansgat material.) Little need be said about the other barriers. With regard to the Red Sea, Butzer and Sigmon correctly note my over- simplification in the precis, but in the book I did mention the "Oligocene prelude" and stated merely that "the Red Sea has been a faunal barrier to land mammals from about 21-25 million years ago," etc. This conclusion was based, among other things, upon the subaerial deposition of basaltic flows overlying laterites, and the formation of hypabyssal intrusives with K/Ar dates ranging from 20.6 to 24.3 million years, accompanied by upward ramping of the rift valley flanks, and followed by the sedimentation of 3,500 m of marls and evaporites (e.g., Brown 1970, Davies and Tramontini 1970). I do not think that a revision is necessary. Admittedly, Girdler and Styles's (1974) new data are surprising, but we will have to wait and see how these can be reconciled with the current literature (e.g., Falcon et al. 1970). With regard to the Niger and Chad drainage systems, the only thing I can do is recommend further research. 5. Chronology. Though I was aware of certain discrep- ancies between the current marine and land-mammal chronostratigraphies, I neglected them because I thought it was obvious that my terminology referred to the latter 442 C U R R E N T A N T H R O P O L O G Y</page><page sequence="17">Kortlanrt: APE AND HUMAN EVOLUTION (e.g., Kurten 1971). Recent research (quoted extensively by Delson) has, however, shown that some of these discrep- ancies are much greater than was previously supposed. Furthermore, Delson's critique correctly points out that the indiscriminate use of such terms as Miocene, Pliocene, and Pleistocene, when dealing with land and freshwater faunas (as opposed to marine faunas), may all too easily lead to confusion and errors. The marine nomenclature must be considered as the authentic one, because it has worldwide application; the land-mammal stratigraphic ter- minology is, so to speak, a regional dialect. It may be wise, therefore, always to refer explicitly to the land-mammal "Miocene," the land-mammal "Pliocene," etc., with quota- tion marks to keep the reader alert. I do not think however, that my use of the terminology has led to errors in the book. 6. Taxonomy. I must admit that my statement that "taxonomic nomenclature aims to reflect the successive phylogenetic furcations" (p. 27) was ill-chosen. This semi- cladistic paraphrase incorrectly suggests that (inferred) phylogenetic furcations constitute the only criteria for tax- onomic classification. Actually, of course, taxonomic classi- fication is primarily based upon the degree to which adaptive changes have occurred in different lineages during evolution, rather than primarily upon the temporal succes- sion of furcations. That is why we classify the crocodiles among the reptiles, though they are temporally closer to the birds than to the turtles, lizards, and snakes, as Iwamoto correctly remarks. My slip of the pen (or perhaps my "lack of understanding of systematic biology," to quote Szalay) has blurred the distinction between two different concepts of hominoid taxonomy: (a) Many taxonomists and paleon- tologists classify the great apes in one family (the Pongidae) and the Rama apes, ape-men, and man in another family (the Hominidae), and do so because, among other things, they think that these two groups furcated before the orangu- tan branched off from the African apes (fig. 1 above). (b) Other taxonomists, e.g., Mayr (1969) and Simpson (1963), while they recognize that the hominids presumably diverged from the African apes after the orangutan had branched off (i.e., as in fig. 2), nevertheless classify the African apes together with the orangutan (Pongo) in the Pongidae. They do so mainly because they feel that the uniqueness of man's biological adaptations justifies separate familial taxonomic ranking, whereas the great apes are considered to occupy approximately one and the same adaptive zone. Figure 5 (from Simpson 1963) illustrates this point. I regret having lumped together the "majority of com- parative anatomists, paleontologists, and taxonomists" and thus having brought out only the first of these viewpoints, neglecting the second. As I stated in the book's foreword, covering such a wide scope and at the same time making the book understandable to the nonspecialist inevitably led to some loss of precision. However, I disagree with both concepts. It is sheer anthropomorphism to attribute to the great apes approximately one and the same adaptive zone. If I were an orangutan, I would classify the African apes and man together because they walk and run on the ground and infrequently travel through the canopy, occur often in open areas, savannas, and bushlands, and are rare in the type of forest structure where an orangutan feels at home. Admittedly, man is a bit peculiar because he walks long distances upright to carry his food and water, but the other apes do so for shorter distances, and many monkeys have cheek-pouches for the same purpose. Fur- thermore, in many areas of Africa (induding savannas, woodlands, and forests) chimpanzees, gorillas, "natural" men, and "domesticated" men are serious competitors for food and are preyed upon by the same carnivore. Hence they all obviously occupy approximately the same adaptive zone. Moreover, they all share the same ancestor. Finally, if I were an orangutan, I would feel highly superior, both technologically, because I would have four hands, and mentally, because I would be able to survive without being dependent upon a social system. I would even feel superior taxonomically, because I would be as distinct from the other apes as the South American tree sloths are from the ground sloths (which, after all, became extinct). Being human, I may have exaggerated here. However, having had some tree-climbing experience in rain-forest trees myself, I can appreciate the uniqueness of orangutan specialization. In this respect, I fully agree with Tuttle's remarks concerning the plurifunctional versatility incorpo- rated in suspensory adaptations. 7. The biochemical "clock." My readers' responses to this issue are quite varied. Some of them are glad that the obvious discrepancies between taxonomic-paleontological and biochemical dendrograms can be resolved (Jacob, Sugiyama). Others remain sceptical about this approach (Lovejoy, Tuttle, Wilkinson). Still others accuse me of "juggling numbers and formulae" in order to make the data "fit [my] preconceived notion" (McHenry, Sigmon).

Vol. 15 No. 4 December 1974 443</page><page sequence="18">Apparently they did not notice the European sense of humour with which I tried to flavour a serious scientific exposition. My choice of words on pp. 30-36 should have made them aware of the double meaning in my argument. Incidentally, while I was writing the book, Lovejoy, Bur- stein, and Heiple (1972) independently produced a more sophisticated calculation than mine and arrived at almost the same outcome. Thus I can once more praise my "prophetic" utterances, to quote Szalay. I hope the reader understands my sense of humour now. 8. Ramapithecus. I am unable to see how Delson and Lovejoy, following Uzzell and Pilbeam (1971), can imagine that Ramapithecus diverged from the dryopithecines any- where between 15 and 20 million years ago. If it is correct that the dryopithecine complex was shaped at least some 18-20 million years ago, that the whole group remained virtually unmodified for several million years, that Ramapithecus-"Kenyapithecus" dates from 14 million years ago, that Ramapithecus-"Kenyapithecus"differs so much from the dryopithecine complex that it may be classified as a hominid, and, finally, that dentitions are quite conservative in hominoid evolution, then I simply cannot understand how, during the very short time-span between 20 minus several million years and 14 million years ago, such a profound change could have taken place. On the contrary, taking the above data for granted, we can only conclude that such a deviant creature must have already diverged several million years earlier, i.e., in the 20-25 (perhaps even 30)-million-year range. This is exactly what all experts who believed in the hominid status of Ramapithecus con- cluded until biomolecular dating became the fashion. Simons and Fleagle (1973:145) still maintain that "the fossil and anatomical evidence (Pilbeam, 1970; Lewis, 1971) points to a pongid-hominid divergence before 20 million years B.P., probably sometime in the late Oligocene." I think it is improper reasoning to bend paleontological consider- ations in such a way as to adapt them to biochemical outcomes. Each discipline has its own logic, and one should not mix the results. Another question is whether or not Ramapithecus is the type of creature it has been thought to be. Genet-Varcin (1969), Kinzey (1970), and Walker and Andrews (1973) have opened new views which have considerably changed the picture and will certainly change the tentative diver- gence datings. We must await further developments. Still another question is whether or not Ramapithecus is the missing Arabian man-ape. My argument that the Miocene Arabian ecosystem must have produced its own dryopithecine descendant, because of the geographical barriers, is one thing; my suggestion that Ramapithecus may have been this Arabian ape is another. The arguments concerning these two issues may be linked, but should not be confused, as Blumenberg and Todd, Delson, McHenry, Szalay, Tuttle, Wilkinson, and Zapfe have done in various ways. Sharma, however, is correct when he states that, within the framework of my own logic, I should have considered the possibility of a Propliopithecus-"Kenyapithecus" lineage in Africa. I think it may be excluded because of the presence of both Hylobatidae and Dryopithecinae in Miocene East Africa, but I would not a priori exclude such a possibility in Arabia. Butzer goes rather far in demanding that I prove the presence of nut-cracking humanoids in Arabia. Toscanelli left the task of sailing westward and finding "India" to Columbus, but the trip turned out to be reward- ing. 9. Ramapithecus-Paranthropus lineage? My proposition that Paranthropus might have descended from Ramapithecus (including "Kenyapithecus"), and gracile Australopithecus from Dryopithecus africanus, grew from three roots: (a) The evolutionary trends of the robust and gracile forms appear to have converged for 34 million years. Extrapolating these lineages backward therefore implies that their divergence must date back very, very long ago (fig. 4 above). (b) When these trends are assumed, the best ancestral candidates among the available fossils are Ramapithecus for Paranthropus and Dryopithecus africanus for (gracile) Australopithecus. (c) When an Arabian origin of the first lineage and an East African origin of the second lineage are assumed, the differences in their chewing apparatuses can be explained by paleoecological conditions. Recently, however, inference (a) has been weakened by the new South African inter- pretations. At present I am unable to judge whether it can still be maintained on the basis of the East African material. Campbell (1972) estimates that boisei and habilis "are not likely to have split much less than 7 million years ago, or possibly even earlier," but since then find KNM-ER 1470 has greatly complicated the issue. What strikes me is that, while Delson and Sigmon explicitly reject the possibility of an ancestor-descendant relationship between Ramapithecus and Paranthropus, no one even discusses the possibility of such a relationship between Dryopithecus afri- canus and one or both of the australopithecines. Are we waiting for the Wenner-Gren cast of the skull of that forgotten ape, KNM-RU 1829? 10. Australopithecus (sensu stricto)-Paranthropus divergence. Lovejoy, McHenry, and Sharma criticize my proposition of an early divergence of these lineages. On the other hand, Blumenberg and Todd (perhaps also Delson?), as well as several other distinguished paleontologists (e.g., Simons and Pilbeam 1965), suggest the possibility that the Dryopithecus major and D. africanus (casu quo D. nyanzae) lineages coexisted side by side for some 20 million years to become our present-day gorilla and chimpanzee. Such things may perhaps occur, but they are contrary to what has happened to closely related (semi)sympatric mammal species in current evolutionary history. At any rate, if such extravagant possibilities are considered seriously, why should one dismiss a priori the possibility of an early separation and subsequent parallel evolution of the gracile and robust lineages on adjacent subcontinents? The ecosys- tems cannot have been very different, because the other mammals could swim and, consequently, could more easily cross the barrier than the ape-men. Thus the niches must have been much the same. Lovejoy's critique that the "contradictions" in my argu- ment on the gracile-robust differences "place the proposed phylogeny in som'e jeopardy" actually turns my argument upside down. The facts are that in some respects the gracile ape-men, and in other respects the robust ones, were better adapted to drier habitats (and, conversely, to moister environments). To solve the problem I proposed that the robust lineage was exposed to gradually desiccating habitat conditions for a longer time-span, but to a lesser degree. Thus eventually its relatively conservative characters (e.g., the brain and the technology) remained "moister" than in the gracile-Homo taxon (fig. 4). The contradiction is in the ape-men; the resolution is in the explanation. For the complete argument, I refer to my book. 11. Interspecific competition and coexistence. The problem of the coexistence of the two australopithecine lineages, and of higher Primates in general, is much more complex than anyone seems to realize: (a) Curry-Lindahl asserts that gorilla and chimpanzee "partly overlap." As far as I know, however, in lowland habitats the one species withdraws when the other arrives in the area, and on isolated large mountains one may find either species but never both together, regardless of the geological and floral char- acteristics of the mountains (P. J. H. van Bree, Medou, 444 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="19">Kortlandt: APE AND IHUMAN EVOLUTION U. Rahm, J. Verschuren, and local informants in Congo- Brazzaville and Zaire, personal communications; see also Jones and Sabater Pi 1971). Similarly, the chimpanzees and baboons on my Beni observation site apparently avoided coming within hearing distance of one another. (b) In the Gombe National Park, chimpanzees and baboons coexist peacefully most of the time and often have social inter- course, but in the meantime a "guerrilla war" goes on which results in the death of 50% of the Beach Troop baboon population input (Teleki 1973). According to R. W. Wrangham (personal communication), however, Tele- ki's data are greatly biased by the abnormal observation conditions at the Gombe Stream Reserve in 1968-69. Furthermore, new evidence collected by Wrangham favours in several respects the food-getting theory rather than the guerrilla theory of chimpanzee predatory behaviour. Even- tually, truth may turn out to lie somewhere in between the two. In Guinea and Zaire, fierce battles between chimpanzees and baboons have been observed (see refer- ences in my book). Once I myself heard the cries and saw some glimpses of what must have been such a fight between two troops. (c) Sigmon points to the cases of peaceful coexistence between apes and scientists. Some hair-raising experiences have shown, however, that this is possible only with an observational policy based upon strict noninter- ference and the avoidance of even the semblance of food competition. Furthermore, cases of peaceful coexistence among humans do not prove the nonexistence of genocidal wars. In Guinea, where large-scale food competition be- tween ape and man occurs, the abundance of chimpanzees in savanna areas is entirely due to religious protection, which may be explained by an earlier symbiosis (the ape being the better spotter and man the better killer of leopards and lions). Such cases of symbiosis are quite common in the African savanna (e.g., man, honey badger, and honey guide bird; zebra, gnu, and ostrich). In the forest, a symbiosis occurs between monkeys, apes, and the white- crested hornbill (Tropicanus albocristatus). (d) Wilkinson argues that the Early Pleistocene hominines must have been able to stand their ground against the large apes because they had survived savanna-dwelling predators for eons. Every zookeeper and circus man knows, however, that it is relatively easy to keep most beasts of prey at bay by means of a broom because they will bite the wood and thus take the invulnerability of the man for granted. Apes, on the other hand, will snatch away the broom and bite the keeper because they are themselves weapon-users by nature and understand the trick. (e) Curry-Lindahl and Sigmon think that character divergence and ecological specialization suffice to explain gracile-robust coexistence. Actually, the problem is that the dental, cranial, and mandibular evidence suggests a convergence. (f) Another complication is that the tree-climbing abilities of predators in different geological periods and geographical ecosystems must be taken into account. Comparing the anatomy and habits of the creodonts, the leopard, and the clouded leopard with the adaptations of the dryopithecines, the African apes, and the Asian apes illustrates this point. Nevertheless, however complicated the problem, it is man- ageable. The facts are accessible, and we can master them. 12. Paleogeographical determinism. No less than four or five reviewers object to my deterministic approach and/or my deterministic presentation of the facts. Lovejoy points to the "quite restrictive limits on the utility" of paleogeo- graphic data in delineating phylogeny; McHenry accuses me of "arranging information . . . to conform to . . . geographical determinism"; Malik objects to the "over-de- terministic manner of presentation . . .as if . . . there was something supernatural that made evolutionary pro- cesses lead inevitably" to man-the-wise; Szalay feels that "ready answers from a priori ecological and theoretical considerations" put "the cart before the horse"; and Wilkin- son says that I am "trying to persuade the reader that the truth has finally been found." Here we have come to the central issue of the book. Let me quote from the foreword (p. 9): "The fundamental scientific philosophy underlying this book is that all the diversity of life on earth-including the human mind-has been shaped, in a strictly deterministic manner, by the diversity of physical conditions on our planet. Thus the basic sciences for explaining the history and diversity of life are primarily the earth sciences." In other words, the geosystem is the horse that pulls the cart of evolution. What I have tried to do is to put the horse exactly where it belongs. In a paleontological museum one can see the cart, but not the horse. Fieldworkers in ecology and behaviour, on the other hand, can see the horse at work. They watch animals being born or hatching, fighting for a niche, reproducing or (quite often!) not reproducing, and dying. This is how evolution proceeds. Sugiyama, referring to my charac- terization of the dryopithecines as "something like a grossly oversized langur monkey," illustrates my point very well when he states that his unpublished work on the adaptability of Presbytis entellus in semideserts, high mountain forests, and temperate rich forests "may offer more important data for reconstructing the life-style and adaptability of fossil primates than the author expects." In workaday scientific life we may distinguish, with some exaggeration, two kinds of colleagues: the bookkeepers and the causalists (compare Copernicus and Kepler with New- ton). Both categories have their moral rights. However, if it is the geosystem that shapes the evolutionary process, and if (for the time being) paleogeographic data have limited utility in delineating phylogeny, then the fact collectors should dig for more paleogeography, so that the causalists can do their job, rather than primarily seeking more hominids and hominoids whose status will probably be as shaky as that of Ramapithecus, "Kenyapithecus," and Gi- gantopithecus. Actually, much of the causalist's digging can be done at low cost in the geology library. It should be done. Many answers are ready, to quote Szalay in a sense other than he intended. I have only tried to contribute to a beginning, as Raemsch rightly remarks. 13. Miscellaneous issues. Blumenberg and Todd are dis- appointed to find the deltumanization hypothesis of African ape evolution neglected (Kortlandt 1959, 1968; Kortlandt and Kooij 1963; Kortlandt and van Zon 1968-69). This hypothesis was originally formulated at a time when every- one still believed that the chimpanzee had specialized as a brachiating forest-dweller. It attempted to explain the presence of savanna-adapted behaviour patterns in chimpanzees and gorillas by assuming that their ancestors withdrew from more open habitats into rain forests because of interspecific competition with emerging man in the sudanian dry forests, woodlands, and savannas. We now know that the chimpanzee naturally belongs partly in such habitats and that his savanna-adapted behaviour patterns are functional there (Kortlandt et al. n.d.). Consequently, my present book implies a "dechimpization" hypothesis of gorilla evolution, a "semi-gibbonization" hypothesis of Pan paniscus evolution, and a semi-dehumanization hypothesis of chimpanzee evolution for the time period following man's intrusion into chimpanzee territory (pre- sumably with the advent of javelin throwing). Things turned out to be more complicated than I had previously thought. Curry-Lindahl and Tuttle wonder why I characterized Vol. 15 No. 4 December 1974 445</page><page sequence="20">the gorilla as "a sort of drop-out or degenerate." The reasons are (a) his obvious stupidity, compared to the other great apes, in zoo and laboratory situations, (b) Schaller's account (1963) showing dysfunction of sexual and social behaviour, fouling the nest, etc., (c) Schaller's characterization of "his" gorillas as "sitting the whole day on their hindquarters and gazing out into the fog" (personal communication). The habitat of Schaller's gorillas was, however, quite abnor- mal for this species. Recent work by Alan Goodall (no relation to Jane) on gorillas living in a more normal habitat is presenting a different picture (personal communication). I will have to adapt my views when the results are published. I wonder whether Curry-Lindahl's observations of chimpanzees in climax rain-forest habitats in the Ituri and eastern part of the Congo Basin refer to the truly evergreen Gilbertiodendron dewevrei and Julbernardia seretii forests or to the transitional and more or less semideciduous Scoro- dophloeus, Cynometra, and Triplochiton types of forest. This makes considerable difference as to the stand of the trees, the "physiognomy" of the forest, and the possibilities of arboreal locomotion. In the Nimba Mountains, at any rate, chimpanzees are much more abundant in the fairly open and semideciduous Triplochiton-Chrysophyllum climax forest on the Guinean dry side than in the closed evergreen Tarrietia-Mapania climax forest on the Liberian wet side (J. G. Adam and J. Verschuren, personal communications, and my observations). I think that Blumenberg and Todd have misread my exposition on Australopithecus, Paranthropus, and Homo (in- cluding H. habilis). Suffice it to refer to figures 16 and 17 in the book for the phylogeny and to pp. 53-55 for the taxonomy. 14. Final remark. Of the papers quoted by the reviewers, 40% date from 1972 or later, i.e., they were published while I was writing the book or thereafter, or are still in press. Does this mean that the book is already outdated? I do not think so. Science progresses less quickly than its active contributors tend to think when rejoicing in their discoveries. Delson mentions seven recent studies in pa- leoanthropology (without giving the bibliographic refer- ences) which, in his view, "are conspicuous for their absence" in my book. From what I have read of these papers, it seems to me that the overall picture has remained almost the same. The latest find from Omo, an ulna bone (Howell and Wood 1974), is in line with my tentative interpretation of the locomotor patterns of the robust australopithecines, based upon earlier less complete finds. Campbell's (1972) fundamental review (not mentioned by Delson) raises an impressive number of basic issues, which, however, can be solved only by producing more factual evidence. As far as I can see, really great progress has been made mainly in the field of chronostratigraphic correlations (Bishop and Miller 1972, Keast, Erk, and Glass 1972, and others). A major problem remains. The ramifications of my argument carried me into fields that ranged from geophys- ics and tropical forestry to biochemistry, dental anatomy, and psychoanalysis. How could I keep abreast of all the current literature? Living in Holland was a great advantage, because the libraries of four general and two specialized universities were within an hour's drive, but still the depart- mentalization of science and the inadequacy of library procedures caused difficulties. Occasionally I wrote desper- ate letters to colleagues all over the world in order to get the latest news and newest reprints. In the end I put a sign on my wall-"Qui n'a patience n'a pas science" -and decided to publish a limited-circulation, preliminary edition of the book. What I have learned from this is that we badly need an adequate information-retrieval system, pref- erably wvorldwide, to give us better access to those fields of knowledge which lie outside the realm of what is currently considered to constitute anthropology, but which are nev- ertheless immediately pertinent to our discipline, or may one day come to be.
