Pp. i, 83 (paper). This short booklet makes no effort to proselytize. It speaks to the converted—those planning to estab lish a student-supported public interest law firm on their campus. It speaks from firsthand knowledge, for the material contained in this guidebook is based on the experience of those who originated and developed Citizens Action Law (C.A.L.) Advocates on the Berkeley campus of the University of California. 1.

Advocates, first out lines and then comments upon the organizational process—including the assembling of the steering committee, the filing of the Articles of Incor poration, negotiations with campus officials, encouragement of media sup port, the university referendum and the vote of the Board of Regents (or Trustees). There is some hand-holding advice: "Avoid uncalculated anger even if a student negotiator must briefly leave the room in order to regain composure."2 But it detracts little from an otherwise comprehensive and clearly written analysis of the formation process. The Appendix, which comprises one-half of the booklet, contains most of the documents the students found necessary in planning the law firm, including the Articles of Incorporation, the Bylaws, and a sample leaflet distributed to university students. A primary purpose of C.A.L. Advocates, as stated in the Articles, is to "preserve, protect and defend the environment against misuse . . . ."3 This booklet should be required reading for those who recognize the unique role student-supported public interest law firms can play in achieving these goals and who want guidance in forming such a law firm through their college or university.

Although still a relatively young science, it has been highly popularized by the writings of such author scientists as Konrad Lorenz and Desmond Morris. The study of animal behavior has raised increasingly numerous questions concerning man's re lationship to animals—the impulses and patterns of action, if any, which man has inherited from and shares with his animal forebears. While the author recognizes that for many ethologists anthropomorphism is an un forgiveable scientific sin, she feels that if one studies animals with the intent to determine not how they are like men but how they are like animals, the discovery of biologic and social traits similar to both can only deepen man's understanding and appreciation of himself and his evolutionary roots. Ex amples of the "blurred borderline" between man and beast are curiosity and a yearning for the supernormal, two attributes which until recently were thought to be singular to the human species. In its treatment of such normal animal behavior as mating, bearing of young, learning and teaching, aggressiveness, and playfulness, the book is replete with material that makes for both entertaining and informative read ing.
