<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS The Letters of Emily Dickinson. Edited by Thomas H. Johnson and Theodora V. W. Ward. 3 vols. (Cambridge: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. 1958. Pp. xxvii, 999. $25.00.) These letters were meant to be sipped at leisure with puzzle- ment and delight, not to be swallowed whole and strung one to the other; they were meant to be received, not reviewed. To read over a thousand of them at a stretch, however varied invention and circumstance may make them, is both taxing and unfair. Our lungs are not designed for prolonged stays in such a rarefied at- mosphere; nor is our wit able to respond, letter after letter, year after year, volume after volume, to a sting which, after all, only made periodic assaults on correspondents. If Emily Dickinson's poems gain by being read in quantities, it is because her originality requires the confirmation of achievement, but has found safe anchorage in poetic form and shares it with us; whereas in her letters the extreme singularity of the person shines sharply through -alone. It may be a pity, as Professor Whicher suggested in his classic study, that these missives cannot be published in the actual form they assumed on the sheet of writing paper. It would be easier for us to see how close to the borderline of poetry-of her own poetry -Emily Dickinson stayed at all times, and what an imperceptible change in the intensity of the current it took to magnetize the letter into a poem. This Was a Poet pointed out two early passages where meter and rhyme were fairly straining to burst out from the fetters of prose. There were others, and the disguise they wore was soon to be discarded. But a more accurate reproduction would still be a long way from easing the reviewer's task. Though not deeper, our world is wider than Amherst, and where, for us too, there is seclusion, we have grown accustomed to find it, not be- hind white fluttery curtains, but in the street, in our work, in our efforts to cope with the jagged demands or the smooth drone of daily activity. We are threatened by more ominous gods than the one Reverend Colton could invoke. This is not to begrudge Emily Dickinson what she was or what her family allowed her to become, 99</page><page sequence="2">THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY but to admit that she commands a firmer hold on our admiration and our affection than on our understanding or our patience. We cannot help sympathizing somewhat with stolid Mr. Higginson who, after one of his visits to Amherst, wrote about his "partially cracked poetess." Granted that the "crack" was superb; but the woman does make one uneasy. There are early letters of hers where humor and hysteria seem strangely coterminous. And there is a note of thin childlike cruelty in her fancy that will ring more than once. The task of preparing a complete edition of the letters cannot have been an easy one; and Mr. Johnson, seconded by Mrs. Ward, has lavished so much care on it that the reader's gratitude must remain an inadequate reward. In most cases, dates have had to be conjectured both from internal evidence and from the poet's handwriting. Names, titles, and quotations have been identified. And the notes and introductory statements to the various sections show time and again that a sensitive hand is discreetly at the helm. My only quarrel with the editorial procedure followed in the text -and quarrel is too pompous a word-is that where misspellings have been preserved without any identifying symbol, the sus- picion of a misprint remains. For instance, did Emily Dickinson write: ". . . found Father is great agitation at my protracted stay" (p. 111)? Other mistakes, like "liesure" and "Febuary," are more plausible, while "magazinine" has such a wonderful flavor that one would like to think it intentional. The collection, though it has gathered all available material, remains inevitably spotty. It is amply representative, nevertheless, and one cannot expect that further discoveries would radically add to our knowledge of the poet-except perhaps in the case of communications to and from Charles Wadsworth and Judge Lord, for whom her devotion verged on exaltation. Many letters have been destroyed, many are lost. There are years, like 1857, for which we have none; others, like 1855-1856, 1863, 1866-1869, for each of which we have less than ten. The numbers grow larger after 1875, the high points being 1883 and 1884, which total 164 letters. But many of these are one-sentence messages sent to sister- in-law Susan across the lawn, congratulations, presentation or thank-you notes for flowers, short expressions of mourning and consolation at the death of a friend. Admirably pithy and tan- 100</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS talizing as they often are, they are not as revealing as the longer letters which Emily Dickinson wrote in her youth. Whereas the decade 1847-1857 yields here, roughly speaking, 170 letters which occupy 280 pages, the final decade of the poet's life yields three times as many communications which, however, occupy about the same number of pages. The gushing breathlessness of the early years has been tamed into wiriness and crispness of cadence. Had not her brother lived in the house next door, there would have been more letters to him, and their absence is to be deplored. The ones she wrote him while he taught or studied in Boston are among the most spontaneous of the whole collection. In many of the others, even to her dearest friends, something forced steals over the expression and gradually becomes the norm. She has been taking possession of her own person, has grown into her own mask, has become aware of something that expects her to sharpen her clauses and to find seventy different ways of saying thank you. She belongs to that fastidious troupe for whom the world, each time, hangs on a sentence. As a consequence, almost everything she writes is quotable for wisdom or quaintness, though the tone may range from majestic to maudlin. She brings to mind the French prdcieuses of the seventeenth century, before the great onslaught of clarity did away with tortuous concision and transparence became the soul of elegance. They, too, "cultivated their differences"; for them too, singularity of expression was the obvious corollary of a refined mind. They raised up about themselves a private world, where everything had private value. This transfiguration of the commonplace turned water into crystal, flowers into jewels, lovers into gods, fact into anecdote and meaning. One recognizes here a fundamental attitude of poetry which was familiar to Emily Dick- inson. That there is also delightful humor in her letters, should not surprise. Is not a common spring of poetry and humor to be sought in animism, or even in anthropomorphism? An inclination to duplicate everywhere the formalities of human society achieves humor; whereas bestowing human qualities and values where none obtain may achieve poetry. What indeed lie at the root of Emily Dickinson's greatness are the sense of life and the capacity for love to which she gives mem- orable utterance in many of her letters. "The Charms of the Heaven in the bush are superceded [sic] I fear, by the Heaven in 101</page><page sequence="4">THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY the hand, occasionally," she writes to Samuel Bowles; "Life is the finest secret," to Mrs. Holland; and to Maria Whitney, "I fear we think too lightly of the gift of mortality, which, too gigantic to comprehend, certainly cannot be estimated." Life, in its mys- tery, its intricacies, its unity, has supplanted the Puritans' God as the prime mover of her world. She perceives and feels it as force- fully, in her own way, as her contemporary Gerald Manley Hop- kins. She can and does anticipate the Catalan poet Maragall's question: "If the world is so lovely, Lord . . . what more canst Thou give us in another life?" In her, familiarity with the deep does not breed contempt for the minute. Unexpected quarters yield an oblique confirmation: the closest parallel that may be found to some of her "nature" poems comes from the most power- ful poet of her age, Victor Hugo, in Les Chansons des Rues et des Bois, where the same alliance of driving force, pin-point imagery and wit sparkles dazzlingly. What Hugo squanders with his im- mense visionary breath, she hoards; but her sentences coiled in the grass also lash out with viperine energy. The world for her was a treasure not to be wasted, and she is never more moving than when she goes about taking meticulous inventory of its riches. Then we recognize her as an Alice born on the other side of the looking-glass, and we truly know her wonderland was earth. MARIO MAURIN. Henry Adams: The Middle Years. By Ernest Samuels. (Cambridge: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. 1958. Pp. xiv, 514. $7.50.) Sworn enemy of biographers, Henry Adams became a modern Rameses who did his best to keep future diggers and desecrators away. The stone that loosely sealed his pyramid was the silence he talked so much about. Beyond that he put the false passage of the Education, miscalled "An Autobiography," which seemed to disclose the inner chambers of his life and for a long time kept the world from seeing much more than it revealed. But Ernest Samuels, certain that there must be another and better way in, has from the first confronted the "great mass of material" which Adams saw to be, next to a true scarcity, the greatest obstacle to 102</page></plain_text>
