Haut GM Research Laboratories Biomedical Science Dept. Warren, Ml Guy S. Nusholtz University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute Ann Arbor, Ml ABSTRACT Head-to-knee interaction of the right front passenger dummy can occur in some 30-35 MPH crash barrier tests. The biofidelity and significance of these interactions as related to predicting human response was addressed in this study. In a series of laboratory experiments an instrumented headform was dropped on the dummy knee to simulate the barrier interactions. These test results were then related to the human by dropping the same headform on the cadaver leg. The instrumented headform was dropped from three heights to impact the Part 572 dummy knee at three velocities. Two impact sites and two impact angles were used. These test parameters bracketed the barrier conditions. Measurements from headform accelerometers permitted calculation of HIC value for comparison to barrier values. Comparable experiments were subsequently performed with three unembalmed cadaver subjects using the same headform and test procedures . Impacts on the 90 degree flexed dummy knee at 6 and 7 m/s were found to correspond to the HIC vs impact velocity "window" of barrier test results (400-1400 HIC and 5.8-7.2 m/s). Identical tests on the knees of three unembalmed cadaver subjects produced HIC values averaging 45% of the dummy values . Head-to-knee impact tests on cadaver subjects indicate a lack of biofidelity in the dummy lower leg structure for this type of impact. Assuming that head-to-knee interaction actually occurs in field accidents , values of HIC measured from dummy crash simulation experiments are likely to overestimate the severity of the interaction. OCCASIONALLY IN 30-35 MPH BARRIER TESTS the head of the three point belted right front passenger contacts the knee resulting in highr unacceptable HIC 's measured from the headform[l] 1 . In the current study the realism and significance of head-to-knee contact in the dummy were questioned. Early investigations compared the axial knee impact response of the Part 572 dummy knee to the cadaver [2,3, 4,5,6] . Rigid pendulum impact tests of Horsch[5] directed on the femoral axis indicate peak knee contact forces for the cadaver averaging 42% of those for the Part 572 dummy. This was attributed to differences in skeletal mass and the lack of adequate padding over the rigid metalic dummy knee. Melvin[6] showed similar results against rigid interfaces. Lightly padded impacts showed cadaver knee forces approximately 52% of the dummy. Target impingement tests by Kroell[7] indicate peak knee contact forces in the cadaver averaging 54% of those in the Part 572 dummy for comparative tests. For heavily padded impacts the peak knee contact forces were more comparable [6 , 8] as the smaller contact area of the dummy knee compensated for its higher stiffness. While the above studies show a lack of biofidelity in the Part 572 knee for axially directed impacts, head-to-knee contact involves headform interaction perpendicular to the mid or distal femur . 1.

The Part 572 headform responses to an impact environment and configuration are well documented [ 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 ] . Contact velocity, angle and location of head impact were comparable to representative barrier and sled test data in which head-to-knee contact took place. The results of the current experiments compare favorably with earlier studies for axially directed knee impacts showing a lack of biofidelity in the Part 572 knee for head-to-knee type interaction. Measured values of HIC on the Part 572 headform are likely an overestimate of the severity of impact to the human head if such impact occurred in a field situation. METHODOLOGY BARRIER AND SLED TESTS - High speed movies and data of four barrier and eight sled tests were reviewed to determine test parameters relevant to head-to-knee contact (Table I). Head-to- knee interaction occurred in some tests when the upper torso of the belted dummy passenger rotated over the shoulder belt and the left front eminence of the forehead impacted the right knee(Fig.l). At contact of the head with the knee the lower extremity appeared to be positioned by a light tibia-instrument panel interaction (Figs. 1,2). Some downward movement of the knee could be detected at impact. The head impact angle with the femur varied from parallel to the tibial axis with the knee flexed at 90 degrees to approximately 45 degrees off axis and directed toward the hip. Head impact location appeared to vary from a point 2 cm proximal to the knee (test site 1) to nearly 10 cm proximal (test site 2 ). Velocity of the head against the femur- knee was measured to be 5.8 to 8.0 m/s in the barrier and sled tests(Table I). LABORATORY TESTS OF DUMMY , HEAD-TO- KNEE INTERACTION - Barrier and sled test parameters of head-to-knee contact interaction were simulated in laboratory tests using a free falling instumented headform onto a stationary knee structure. Due to previously mentioned variation of head impact velocity, angle of impact and contact location for barrier and sled tests, experiments were designed to "bracket" the whole body data. The Part 572 dummy was positioned in seated and supine postures with the knee flexed 90 degrees (Fig. 3) . For the supine configuration headform impact occurred as a glancing-type blow with a force vector approximately 45 degrees inclined to the femur at 2 cm and 10 cm proximal to the knee. The dummy foot was fixed to a rigid platen with straps with no shoe on(Fig.4). The instrumented headform was dropped in freefall onto the lower extremity of the dummy. Initai contact velocity was adjusted to 6 m/s, 7 m/s, or 8 m/s by raising the free-fall height above the contact point (Fig. 5) . This height measurement was carefully made after final positioning of the dummy. Three experiments were conducted at each velocity, seating orientation and impact location ( 2 or 10 cm proximal to the knee) for a total of thirty-six tests. The headform was guided for impact onto the lower extremity (Fig. 6) . The 4.6 kg headform was mounted to a 0.2 kg bracket which positioned the head so that impact was to the right or left eminence of the forehead by rotation of the head 45 degrees (0) right or left about the x-xł axis relative to the Frankfort plane and 135 degrees (0) about the y-yf axis. Conventional instrumentation was employed in the dummy tests. Three orthogonally mounted acce 1er omet er s were positioned at the center of gravity of the headform. Foot loads were measured coincident (SI) and perpendicular (AP) to the tibia with an 8.9 kN capacity biaxial load cell(Fig.4). Transducer responses were conditioned and recorded on FM tape. Signals were filtered (SAE- J211) , sampled at 8K and processed for resultant time history and computation of HIC. LABORATORY TESTS OF.

Michigan and were tested under a collaborative program with UMTRI . The experimental setup for free-fall drop tests of the instrumented dummy head onto the cadaver knee followed that previously described for the dummy knee tests(Fig.3) . Three high speed cameras (1000 fps-lateral and frontal view, 3000 fps-lateral view)provided 16 mm color movie coverage of the head and knee kinematics. Free-fall experiments were conducted at contact velocities of 6 ,7 ,and 8 m/s. Supine and seated cadaver orientations were used. Again a pair of taut vertical steel cables were used to guide the 4.8 kg, Part 572 instrumented headform assembly in free-fall drops onto the selected impact site. The upper torso of the cadaver subject was supported by a harness and an overhead support cable. The subject was placed on a stand to position the femur the femur horizontally and the tibia vertically for the seated position. For the supine position the subject was Figure 3 Comparison of knee impact sites on human cadaver subjects and on the Part 572 anthropomorphic dummy-lateral views.</page><page sequence="5">HEAD-TO-KNEE IMPACTS 6.881 Figure 4 Biaxial load cell positioned perpendicular to the tibia to measure AP and SI loading. placed on a horizontal mounting surface with the femur-tibia at 90 degrees and the impact at 45 degrees to the femur. In both cases the load cell platen under the foot was positioned perpendicular to the tibia. Impact tests were conducted at 2 cm and 10 cm proximal to the knee on contralateral limbs in a sequence that progressively loaded the knee with higher severity. This protocol minimized the chance of repeated tests on a Figure 5 Headform guide wire installation in the laboratory.

If by palpation of the lower extremity an injury was found, the test sequence on that limb was terminated. The actual test sequence was determined from measurements of impact severity on companion dummy tests. The test sequence was set up to provide matched loading conditions on contralateral limbs. Initai tests on the first two specimens were conducted at 6 m/s with the subjects in the supine position. The right limb was tested at the 2 cm site followed by a test on the left knee at the 10 cm site. The cadavers were then seated and impacted, at 7 m/s, on the right limb at the 10 cm site followed by impact on the left limb at the 2 cm site. For cadaver No. 2 this procedure was reversed. Cadaver No.l was not tested at the 7 m/s impact velocity in the supine position. In the seated position the impact sites were reversed with the right knee being impacted at the 2 cm site and the left at the 10 cm site. Cadaver No. 2 was tested in both the seated and supine positions and at the 2 cm and 10 cm sites and at all three velocities. Cadaver No. 3 was impacted in the seated and supine positions only at the 2 cm site. Seated impacts were at 6,7 and 8 m/s while supine impacts were conducted at 6 and 7 m/s. Prior to an experiment on each cadaver the lower extremities were carefully examined by palpation of the knee joint and by a series of radiographs. This examination was performed to establish the pretest condition of the specimen's lower extremity skeleton prior to impact experimentation. The specimens selected for this study were from a relatively young [41. 3119.1 yrs] population. Basic anthropomorphic information is provided in the Appendix. The instrumentation used in the cadaver experiments was identical to that of the dummy tests. TEST RESULTS (All significant test data are presented in Tables II, III and IV) BARRIER AND SLED - Barrier test results from the Proving Grounds were used as a basis for the simulation of head-to-knee contact in the laboratory free-fall drop tests(Table I). Four barrier tests were analyzed where head- to-knee contact occurred. Common to all tests was a double peak in the time history of the head resultant acceleration response(Fig.7) . The initial peaks (328 g ± 22 g's) were significantly greater than the second. Without contact of the head onto the knee, peak resultant head acceleration was approximately 50 głs, based on other test data supplied by the GM Proving Grounds. Subtracting the baseline 50 g's from 328 g's for contact yields approximately 283 g's of acceleration for head-to-knee contact. The pulse duration was 12 i 2.4 ms. HIC severity for the four barrier tests was 1365 ± 436. Without head-to-knee contact, HIC is commonly in the 550 range. Again by subtraction of the HIC for non-contact tests, we can construct a "window" for barrier test data that can be related to the laboratory head-to-knee experiments. This "window"of HIC and head impact velocity ranged from 5.8 to 7.2 m/s wide and from 400 to 1400 HIC high(Fig.8).

Impacts onto the seated dummy knee produced an average peak resultant head acceleration of 270 g's for the 6 m/s impact test(Table II). The average peak head resultant accelerations increased from 270 g's to 408 g's as the velocity went from 6 to 8 m/s. The primary double pulse duration remained relatively constant at 7.7 ms for impacts at the three velocities in the seated position. 50Q.

Supine-2 cm site: Peak resultant accelerations were generally higher for the seated than supine test condition. In supine tests, the headform impacted the knee with a glancing type blow. This produced peak resultant accelerations on the head averaging 73% of those for the seated impact position. The duration of the primary impact pulse was similar to that measured for the seated dummy position. Seated/ supine-2 cm site: HIC computed from head-to-knee contacts in free-fall experiments for the seated configuration rose from approximately 1000 at 6 m/s to greater than 2400 for the 8 m/s test. HIC severity for impacts on the supine dummy increased from approximately 700 at 6 m/s to greater than 1300 at 8 m/s. Seated-10 cm site: Severity of impact to the head was significantly reduced for contact interactions located 10 cm proximal to the knee of the dummy. In these experiments the resultant head acceleration did not have a prominent second pulse(Fig. 10) . Impacts located 10 cm proximal to the knee produced resultant accelerations on the head which rose from 112 at 6 m/s impact velocity to 206 at 8 m/s. Peak resultant accelerations to the head averaged 48% of that for the 2 cm location. The pulse duration averaged 11 ms as compared to 7.7 ms for the 2 cm located impact tests of the seated dummy. HIC severity of impact on the head significantly increased with impact velocity at the 10 cm location. HIC rose from approximately 350 at 6 m/s to 1100 at 8 m/s. On the average, HIC severity at the more proximal location(10 cm)averaged 42% of those measured for impacts onto the seated dummy at the 2 cm location. 500 J Seated 500- SeateļJ G I] 2 * G 10 CM oí , - ok^ , 0 MS Mc; 10 0 10 MS Mc; MS Figure 10 Head resultant acceleration time history for dummy head-to-knee laboratory tests. Supine-10 cm site: Head impact severity was a minimum for head-to-knee contact 10 cm proximal to the knee with the supine configured dummy. In this situation peak resultant acceleration to the head averaged 44% of those for the same configuration of the dummy but with impact centered 2 cm proximal to the knee. The duration of the primary pulse was approximately 6.3 ms. The duration of the primary impact pulse was likely shorter for impacts onto the supine limb because this was a glancing blow with a single pulse shape. HIC severity on the head was low for the glancing blows at the 10 cm location. HIC rose from 135 for 6 m/s to 309 for the 8 m/s impact and averaged 31% of those for impact onto the seated dummy. Tibial loads : Head-to-knee contact interactions onto the seated and supine configurated dummies resulted in forces being transmitted through the tibias. These forces were recorded in the load cell positioned under the foot (Fig. 4). In general the results for various test configurations follow those trends in severity previously described for HIC's.</page><page sequence="8">6.884 C. C. CULVER, ET AL. Peak forces increased with contact velocity (Table III). The compressive forces were greater in tests with the dummy seated than supine. Impact tests onto the dummy knee 2 cm proximal were, in general, greater than for tests conducted 10 cm proximal to the knee. It was noted that for impacts in the seated configuration, tibia forces ranged from approximately 7-10 kN. LABORATORY TESTS OF DUMMY HEAD-TO- CADAVER KNEE INTERACTION - These laboratory experiments greatly indicated that impact onto the cadaver resulted in a less severe impact to the head(Table IV ) . The additional compliance observed in cadavers compared to the dummy likely was the result of deformations in the cadaveric knee and ankle, par ticularily for impact tests on the seated cadaver. Seated-2 cm site: Impact of the dummy head 2 cm proximal to the cadaver knee resulted in peak head resultant accelerations of 131 ± 15 g's at 6 m/s to 177 ± 20 g's at 8 m/s. Significant eversión of the ankle was observed in some tests(Fig.ll) . In the seated configuration acceleration responses typically displayed two prominent peaks (Fig. 12 ) . Pulse duration averaged 12 ms. HIC severity increased with inital contact velocity from 390 ± 80 at 6 m/s to 858 ± 77 at 8 m/s. Supine-2 cm site: Impact of the dummy headform 2 cm proximal to the cadaver in the supine configuration resulted in peak head resultant accelerations (88%) of those for the seated configuration. Acceleration pulse durations averaged 12 ms. This was comparable to those for the seated cadaver tests. In these tests the response curves were slightly altered, and the second peak was less prominent (Fig. 12) . HIC severity was on the average 78% of that recorded for the seated configuration. This was likely the result of a more glancing type impact on the supine configured limb. Seated-10 cm site: Impact to the head was less severe for contact interaction located 10 cm proximal to the knee. For the seated configuration, impact located 10 cm proximal to the knee resulted in peak resultant accelerations on the headform averaging 60% of those measured for impacts located 2 cm proximal to the knee. As we previously observed in the dummy tests, headform impacts 10 cm proximal to the knee resulted in acceleration pulses showing a single peak(Fig.l3) . Contact durations were, on the average 13 ms compared to 12 ms at the 2 cm location. HIC severity for impacts 10 cm proximal to the knee for the seated cadaver were 70% of those at the 2 cm location. Supine-10 cm site: For the supine configuration peak resultant accelerations on the headform compared with the seated test. HIC severity was slightly reduced compared to the seated data. Tibial forces: Tibial forces in the cadaver tests were on the average 61% of those for the dummy in the seated configuration and 13% greater than the dummy in the supine tests(Table III). No fractures were observed in radiographs of the tibial plateau or Figure 11 Frontal high speed movies of a cadaver head-to-knee impact showing eversión of the ankle.</page><page sequence="9">HEAD-TO-KNEE IMPACTS 6.885 femoral condyles. Tibial forces were reduced when the cadaver was supine. DATA ANALYSIS Immediately following each test the data tape was computer processed to trace out the time histories of the three head accelerations and the computed head resultant acceleration as shown in Figures 12 and 13. The SI and AP foot load time histories and resultant forces were also produced. Peak accelerations and peak foot loads were printed with the corresponding time of occurrence. HIC values were determined by a conventional "HIC" computer program and printed with the time interval. All data were recorded wide band and filtered at 1000 Hz (SAE J211). The high speed movies of each test were analyzed to determine headform-to- knee impact velocity and kinematics of the headform and the knee/leg structure. DISCUSSION In this investigation head-to-knee contact interaction observed from barrier and sled experiments was simulated in the laboratory by free-fall drop tests of the instrumented Part 572 headform onto the dummy and cadaver lower extremities. The point of contact varied from 2 to 10 cm proximal to the knee. Initial contact velocity was varied by drop height. A"window"was constructed from the HIC and head velocity data of barrier and sled tests. Free-fall drop tests indicated that this"window"of data was reproduced in the laboratory by head contact velocities of 6 and 7 m/s for contacts at the 2 cm location seated and supine, and 10 cm location with the Figure 12 Head resultant time history for cadaver head-to-knee laboratory tests comparing seated and supine responses at 2 cm.</page><page sequence="10">6.886 C. C. CULVER, ET AL. Figure 13 Head resultant time history for cadaver head-to-knee laboratory tests comparing 2 cm and 10 cm responses in the seated position. seated dummy (Fig. 14) . After subtraction of HIC due to the non-contact environment (a sort of baseline HIC) severity of impact seems best fit by 6 m/s at 2 cm seated or supine, 7 m/s supine 2 cm, or 10 cm location with the seated dummy. Based on acceleration waveshapes, the seated configuration results in a prominent double peak characteristic of the sled and barrier tests . In comparative tests on the cadaver for the seated configuration, HIC severity measured from the Part 572 headform averaged approximately 45% of that measured for impact on the dummy knee(Fig.l5) . It seemed apparent that this might be due to a lack of sufficient padding over the rigid metalic knee in the dummy. Interaction of the head with this structure resulted in an overestimate of the HIC severity measure for the head. On the other hand for head-to-knee contacts at the 10 cm location the seated configured tests indicated a closer comparison of the dummy and cadaver (Fig. 16) . In this case the padding of the dummy is sufficient to help simulate the compliance measured in the cadaver. Compliance of the cadaver was found to be, in part, due to motion at the ankle by eversión. Currently there is a lack of biofidelity in the Part 572 at the ankle joint. SUMMARY 1. Laboratory experiments with a Part 572 dummy and three unembalmed cadaver subjects demonstrated the lack of biofidelity in the dummy knee for assessing the severity of possible field accident head-to-knee interaction based on crash barrier test da ta. Cadaver subject HIC values averaged only 45% of the dummy values in tests simulating the</page><page sequence="11">HEAD-TO-KNEE IMPACTS 6.887 crash barrier test head-knee interaction. 2. HIC values for a replicated test on the right and left knees of a cadaver subject were found to correlate well (779 to 861) considering that a small misalignment between the headform drop axis and the femur center line can result in a significantly deflected impact . 3. Compliance of the cadaver ankle to axial tibial loading by eversión and deflection of the longitudinal archs of the foot was shown in high speed movies in one experiment to be approximately 1 cm. On the other hand, the single degree of freedom dummy ankle action and semi- rigid foot structure permitted virtually no significant compliance. This difference in compliance contributed to the lower cadaver subject HIC response. 4. The influence of the large metalic dummy knee structure with thin padding compared to a slightly more proximal position (2 cm to 10 cm) was shown by a reduction in the HIC value of 1002 to 351 (65% less). In comparison identical tests on cadaver subjects showed a reduction of 390 to 297 (24%).
