<plain_text><page sequence="1">SPIRIT POSSESSION AND DEPRIVATION CULTS* I. M. LEwiS University College, London I Anthropologists, no less than the people they study, are much given to the elaboration of those traditions by which men everywhere seek to justify their current interests and activities in terms of some mystically hallowed past. Malinow- ski, indeed, was among the first to explore the sociological implications of such 'mythological charters' as he called them. And my predecessors in these memorial lectures in honour of him have shown remarkable ingenuity in linking what they have had to say to his many-sided contributions to social anthropology. My own 'charter' for this lecture is brief My first point is that it seems to me, as to some of my colleagues, that many of the present impasses in our subject, which result from a too rigid adherence to Radcliffe-Brown's teleological mystique of status quo maintenance, may be resolved by a view of the working of social insti- tutions which owes more to Malinowski and which is essentially flexible, adaptive, and utilitarian. This is the sort of functionalism which I hope to deploy this evening. Secondly, my subject matter concerns religion and sex, topics which certainly engaged the serious attention of Malinowski and led to the production of some of his most inspired as well as of his most popular works. Spirit possession, or at least those aspects with which I shall be concerned here, embodies both themes. And by way of introduction I would only add further that, from the tendentious nominalism of current kinship controversy and the mechanical, if lofty, metaphysic of Levi- Strauss, this is a subject to which I turn with a distinct sense of relief. At least the phenomena which we shall examine this evening have some discernible relation to empirical reality. Spirit possession, from one point of view the root of mysticism, is, I need scarcely remind you, a vast subject. As well as the familiars of a host of less well- known and anonymous shamans, it embraces within a single frame of reference such well-established figures as the Holy Ghost and 'Katie King', the controversial materialisation produced by the famous English medium Florence Cook, investi- gated and vouched for by no less a person than Sir William Crookes, President of the Royal Society from I9I3 to i9i5. Lest this conjunction may seem unduly forced, let me remind you that for some theological writers, and not least for the Rev. J. D. Pearce-Higgins, a prominent member of the Churches' Fellowship for Psychical Study, 'Katie King's activities have been seen as providing corroborative evidence for scientific belief in the Resurrection of Jesus Christ' (Pearce-Higgins 1957: 38). Equally, our topic includes such other spectacular features as dervish dancing, * The Malinowski Memorial Lecture, delivered at the London School of Economics and Political Science on 8 March I966.</page><page sequence="2">308 I. M. LEWIS fire-walking, sword-eating and transvestitism-to say nothing of such technicalities as 'automatic writing'. In the realm of ideas and emotions, we are at once con- fronted by such contradictory themes as innovative inspiration, and conservative resignation expressed in catharsis; by thrusting messianic cults, and by established religions based on the conservative cult of a supreme spiritual deity. Spirit possession thus occupies a central position in comparative religion and theology, in religious phenomenology, in the sociology of religion, and in psychology. With such a vast canvas, in the short space of this lecture, I can scarcely hope to do more than daub out a rough outline of my subject. Certainly I cannot do anything like justice to its formidable literature. I I shall, however, try to draw your attention to certain neglected aspects of the subject which seem to me of crucial importance in appreciating its sociological significance. These concern what in medical parlance would be called the epidemiology of possession, by which in this context I mean the examination of the kinds of categories of person who are most readily prone to possession in different societies. This, I hope to show, is sociologically an illuminating approach and an almost completely novel one, strange though this claim may sound. The majority of writers on spirit possession, as even a cursory glance at the literature will reveal, have been fascinated by the richly dramatic aspects of possession, enthralled by the more bizarre and exotic shamanistic exercises, and absorbed in controversies concerning the truth or falsity of trance states. In short, their main interest has been in everything pertaining to spirit possession which, in the idiom ofthe last Malinowski Lecture (Beattie I966), could be termed 'expressive'. Such sociological analysis as has been offered has focused primarily upon the social roles and statuses of the chronically possessed-whether these be identified as mediums, shamans, or prophets. This position is neatly summed up in Mircea Eliade's book Le chamanisme (i95 i), which is still the standard compendium on the subject. Eliade writes of what he considers the sociologist's proper concern in spirit possession as follows (my translation): 'The sociologist is preoccupied with the social functions of the shaman, of the priest, of the magician: he will study the origin of mystical prestige, its role in the articulation of society, the relations between religious chiefs and political chiefs' (Eliade i95i: 8). Eliade himself is primarily interested in the metaphysical implications of shamanism as a technique for the attainment of ecstasy in the course of which the shaman makes mystical voyages to heaven and mystical descents to hell. In its 'true sense' all this is bound up with the cult of a supreme celestial being. Thus, spirit possession is not for Eliade an essential or intrinsic element, but one which is incidental to the shaman's ecstatic mystical flights and his communion with supreme celestial beings. This conclusion seems to me highly debatable-but whatever may be thought of it, Eliade's programme for sociology represents a fair statement of what social anthropologists and others have written on spirit possession in the past. This concentration of interest, on the social roles performed only by those who through regularly recurrent possession and dramatic rituals function as mediums or shamans, stands in sharp contrast to the prevailing emphasis in anthropological studies of magic, witchcraft, and sorcery. There the trend established by the pioneering works of Evans-Pritchard (I9 37), Kluckhohn (I944) and Marwick (I952)</page><page sequence="3">SPIRIT POSSESSION AND DEPRIVATION CULTS 309 has been to examine in detail the social nexus in which jealousies, enmities, and frustrations between rivals are transmuted into accusations of witchcraft and sorcery. The ritual and magical acts of witch-doctors and sorcerers, of course, receive due attention, but they do not monopolise the stage to the exclusion of the relevant social tensions which must feature strongly in any satisfactory epidemio- logical approach and have been so sadly neglected in most studies of spirit possession. This striking difference of emphasis in analysis results partly, no doubt, from the dramatic aspects of spirit possession which so readily seize the attention of the investigator and deflect his interest away from any detailed examination of the categories of persons who are most prone to be selected as mediums by spirits. After all, in contrast to their attitudes towards witchcraft and sorcery, many anthropologists seem to believe in spirit possession, or at least in some of the powers attributed to those possessed by spirits. Thus much of the literature is taken up, as I have said, with discussion of the psychological status of trance states and of the extent to which shamanistic healing rites possess genuine therapeutic value. Even atheists often believe in extra-sensory perception.2 Recent anthropological writing on witchcraft shows no such preoccupation: there all is delusion and fantasy. Such considerations go far, I think, to explain this distinct difference of emphasis in anthropological studies in the two fields. But whether they do or not, what I shall now try to demonstrate is that the sort of sociological approach which is now taken for granted in the analysis of witchcraft and sorcery is equally revealing when applied to spirit possession. This approach has the additional merit of bringing what has hitherto too often been regarded as an esoteric oddity squarely into the larger field of the sociological study of mystical phenomena and of religion in general. II Little attention, I have asserted, has so far been paid to the question of what categories of person most frequently succumb to spirit possession and figure most prominently in possession cults. Nevertheless, the literature is studded with references to the frequent prominence of women in these cults; and some explicit attempts have been made to explain, or at least to comment upon, this sexual bias on the part of spirits. Thus W. G. Ivens notes that among the Melanesians of the south-east Solomon Islands, although women are rigorously excluded from the 'greater' religious ceremonies, they have a share in the offering of the first fruits, and on other occasions become possessed and may divine and intercede for the sick (Ivens I927: 472). Similarly, Hogbin notes how in Polynesia women are frequently the mediums consulted in those diseases which are ascribed to possession by the spirits of the ancestors, this involving a combination of both patrilineal and matrilineal ancestral power (Hogbin I934: I44 sqq.). With more detail and sophistication, Fortune has shown how amongst the Manus of New Guinea, while women are, as he puts it, 'spiritually disenfranchised in the [paternal] Sir Ghost cult, they are spiritually enfranchised in the tandritanitani cult' (Fortune I935: 95). This statement refers to the mystical power of cursing and blessing, and the ability to control the sex of children as well as family-planning, vested in the</page><page sequence="4">310 I. M. LEWIS matrilineal line. Moreover, while the morally significant patrilineal ghost cult is controlled by men, it is women who consecrate male diviners and practise as mediums. Here, indeed, there is a complicated interplay between men's and women's roles corresponding, to some extent, to the character of the descent system in Manus, any further discussion of which would take us outside the scope of the present argument. In the same vein, A. J. A. Elliot in his detailed study of Chinese spirit possession cults in Singapore notes how, as in Manus, women are the principal mediums in the raising of the souls of the dead, though not necessarily in the wider practice of spirit mediumship. Yet, although here, in this more general cult itis not only women who act as mediums, it is women who provide the main clientele (Elliot I955: 7I, I34 sqq.). And in Africa, amongst the matrilineal Luvale of western Zambia, C. M. N. White has recently shown the prominent part played by women as the victims of illnesses attributed to possession by their matrilineal ancestors (White I96I: 48 sqq.).3 Again, in that magnificent record of the life of an old Hausa woman, Baba of Karo, the very marked absorption of women in the cult of bori spirits elicits the comment from Mary Smith that in this male-dominated Moslem society the 'inability of the Hausa women to participate adequately in the ceremonial and public life of Islam leaves a gap which is filled by the spirit-possession cult' (Mary Smith 1954: 27I). These and similar comments by many other observers of such cults, which it would be only tedious to cite further at this point, typify that line of inter- pretation which views the prominent role of women in spirit possession as a compensation for their exclusion and lack of authority in other spheres. A similar cross-sexual element is equally apparent in the imagery and ritual drama of posses- sion ceremonies. For, whether it is men or women who are the victims of possession -and, of course, I am not claiming that it is only women who are thus affected- the intrusive familiar is frequently of the opposite sex to its host. With this high incidence of the possession of men by female spirits, and of women by male spirits, it is scarcely surprising that the relationship between a medium and his or her attendant familiar should regularly be expressed in terms of marriage. Indeed, in many spirit mediumship cults, full introduction into the coterie of the chronically possessed is accompanied by marriage ceremonies and gifts parallel to those of mortal unions. Thus in the flamboyant zar cult in Ethiopia the new acolyte is referred to as a 'bride' and is assigned two human protectors or 'best men'. These in ordinary marriages may assist the husband to deflower his bride, and subsequently act as her supporters in all disputes between the wife and her husband (Messing I959: 327). In the same vein, when a medium exhibits agitated bodily movements in an ecstatic trance, it is a commonplace to regard the possessed woman as having intercourse with her incubus. This matrimonial theme is of course very familiar to us from our own religious tradition in which a nun's final vows bind her in spiritual union to the sacred bridegroom, Christ; and in the rather different but equally widespread idiom of the stables, in which the relationship between a woman medium and her spirit is expressed in terms of the familiar riding its 'mare', this cross-sexual imagery is equally apparent. This cross-sexual element is also evoked in the ceremonial</page><page sequence="5">SPIRIT POSSESSION AND DEPRIVATION CULTS 3II transvestitism which accompanies many possession rituals, and has been taken by some students of the subject amongst earlier writers, notably by Leo Sternberg (I924), as an essential and indeed definitive characteristic of the whole phenomenon. III I believe, however, that by adopting the epidemiological approach we can go much further than this in interpreting the social implications of spirit possession. Let me start, after the manner of Malinowski, by a brief exposition of my own Somali field material.4 The Somali pastoral nomads of north east Africa are a patrilineal Moslem people. Witchcraft and sorcery, as these phenomena are usually defined, do not figure prominently in Somali ideas of causation. Their main religious life is concerned with the cult of Allah whom they approach through the mediation of the prophet Mohammed and a host of more immediate lineage ancestors and other men of real or imputed piety who, as in Roman Catholicism, play a vital role as mediating saints. This public cult is almost exclusively dominated by men who hold all the main positions of religious authority and prestige. Women in religion are merely passive agents, and, as in many other Moslem countries, are excluded from the mosques. More generally, women are regarded as weak, submissive creatures, despite the exacting nature of their nomadic life and the arduous character of their herding tasks in the management of the flocks of sheep and goats and the draught camels which carry their tents and effects from place to place. Milch camels, by contrast, are the concern of men; and alhough women are disadvantageously placed in the inheritance of all forms of property, they are especially excluded from ownership of the camels which form the joint stock-wealth of groups and represent the standard unit of wealth. In this male-dominated and highly puritanical culture, spirit possession, which is regarded as one cause, among others, of a wide range of illnesses and diseases (ranging from slight malaise to acute organic illnesses), occurs in four fairly well-defined contexts. The first of these concerns cases of frustrated love and passion, and involves emotions which, particularly on the part of men, are not traditionally recognised or overtly acknowledged. If a girl who has been jilted by a boy she loved and who promised privately to marry her exhibits symptoms of extreme lassitude, withdrawal, or even more distinct physical symptoms of illness, her condition is attributed to possession by the object of her affections. Here as in all other cases in Somaliland, this possession is described most generally by a term which means literally 'entering'. This interpretation of the disappointed girl's condition is consistent with the traditional sex morality where the concept of romantic attachment was, as I have said, excluded. Only apparently within the last generation has this rigid attitude begun to change, and today the explicit recognition and acceptance of romantic love is a very popular theme in current Somali poetry and radio 'pop' songs. With these enlightened views, young western-educated Somalis today describe such cases in the Shakespearian idiom of love-sickness. The traditional view, on the other hand, is much more in keeping with that exhibited by seventeenth century French Catholic ecclesiastics in their treatment of the hysterical Sister Jeanne des Anges, prioress of the convent school at Loudon, and her frustrated infatuation for</page><page sequence="6">3I2 1. M. LEW I S the notoriously amorous Canon Urbain Grandier. As those who have read Aldous Huxley's lively evocation in The devils of Loudon (I952) will recall, this poor nun's condition was attributed to possession by malevolent spirits and Grandier was held responsible. He was convicted of witchcraft and burned at the stake in i634. In Somaliland these matters are dealt with less drastically, and no legal action can be taken against the man involved. But it is not only men who are the agents and women the victims in this type of affliction. A youth, forced by the overriding control of his elder kinsman to renounce the girl of his own choosing and impelled to marry another, may, if he evinces similar symptoms of malaise or illness, be regarded as possessed by the true object of his affections. The interpretation which I give is virtually that offered by young educated Somalis themselves. In the case of the jilted girl, no other institutionalised means is available to express her outraged feelings. For it is only where a formal engagement has been contracted with the consent of the two parties of kin that a suit can be placed for breach of promise. Her private emotions and feelings are of little concern in the jural world dominated by men. Illness, and the care and attention which this brings, offer her some comfort. In the case of the frustrated youth, the assimilation of his plight to an illness-for which he cannot in Somali theory be held responsible-similarly enables him to draw attention to his plight without openly revealing the unmentionable and totally unmanly emotional attachment of a man towards a woman.5 While these are both examples of cross-sexual possession of one person by an- other, the underlying circumstances are those of deprivation in which no other jurally acceptable and institutionalised means exist to enable the injured party to seek redress. This sort of direct, person-to-person possession, has close analogies with the malevolent power of the evil eye which is attributed to forlorn, neglected old women, to beggars, and to the poor in general. Of the treatment administered to the possessed patient in these cases I have only time here to say that, as with Sister Jeanne des Anges, the invading spirit is exorcised by a cleric,6 in this case a Moslem man of religion.7 In the other three contexts of Somali spirit possession to which I wish to draw attention, the possession illness, with parallel symptoms real or imagined and ranging from mild hysteria or depression to actual organic injury, is attributed not to the 'entering' of a person but of a nature sprite. Here I refer to those anthropomorphic jinns which in Somaliland, as in other Moslem lands, are held to lurk in every dark and empty corner, poised and ready to strike capriciously and without warning at the unwary passer-by. These malevolent sprites are said to be consumed by envy and greed, and to be particularly covetous of luxurious clothing, finery, perfume and dainty foods. They are known generally as sar (cf Ethopian zar), a word which describes both the sprites themselves and the symptoms attributed to them; and the afflicted victim is described as having been 'entered', 'seized', or 'possessed' by the sar. These are the agencies to which responsibility is attributed for bouts of hysteria to which young camel-herdsmen are sometimes prone. The circumstances are as follows. The camels, as I have said, are herded by the men, and more specifically by boys and young unmarried youths. In the charge of these young men, the</page><page sequence="7">SPIRIT POSSESSION AND DEPRIVATION CULTS 3I3 camels form a herding unit separate from the flocks of sheep and goats which are attached to the nomadic hamlets consisting of women, married men, and young children. This latter herding unit has a much more tightly circumscribed cycle of movement than that followed by the free-ranging camels which, even in the driest seasons, can go without water for up to twenty days and graze far from any permanent well. Thus the camels and their young attendants live a secluded life of their own, often stationing themselves hundreds of miles from the home hamlets and their women-folk. In the dry seasons, they move monotonously back and forth between the pastures and the wells, according to a strict regime dictated by the watering needs of their stock. By any standards their dry season lot is especially hard and demanding: constantly harassed by fear of attack from enemy raiders and marauding animals, and frequently short of food and water, they are also deprived of the opportunity of meeting and chatting with the girls of the hamlets. With no regular means of cooking, their diet consists mainly of the milk of the camels in their care, and often they are as famished and exhausted as their stock. In the wet seasons, when the water requirements of sheep and goats on the one hand, and of camels on the other, are more equal, this dreary picture radically changes. The two herding units now move closer together and the young camel- herdsmen emerge from their dry season sedusion and privation to the comfort and excitement of camp-life. It is on their return to this other welcoming world, with its prospects of meeting girls of marriageable age, that some of the young herdsmen sometimes develop symptoms of hysteria. This is attributed to possession by sar sprites and regarded as a mild, and usually temporary form of madness: it is not taken very seriously. The remedy is provided by the mounting of a dance called 'beating the sar', in which it is essential that girls should participate if the smitten youths are 'to recover their senses'. The accompanying songs, sung by the afflicted boys, have often an implicit sexual content, and the expression 'beating the sar' is in modern urban slang, at least, a synonym for sexual intercourse. In this traditional pastoral setting, however, the youths have to be content with catharsis and sublimation. There is no open license on these occasions, and the virginity of girls is carefully guarded until they marry. Today, even in the interior, however, the position seems to be changing. This type of 'possession', I am told, is now often feigned, and used by youths as a means of pointing the direction of their affections towards a particular girl who is thus drawn into the dance. All I wish to emphasise here, however, is the element of deprivation and frustration present in the lives of these young bachelor herdsmen, and its traditional outlet in this institutionalised form of possession.8 This brings us to the third context of Somali possession, where we touch on a phenomenon with, I believe, the widest significance and correspondences elsewhere. The victim of the malevolent sar's attentions is in this case usually a woman, and particularly a married woman. The stock epidemiological situation is that of the hard-pressed wife struggling to survive and feed her children in the harsh nomadic environment, and liable to some degree of neglect, real or imagined, on the part of her husband. Subjected to frequent, sudden and even prolonged absences by her husband as he pursues his manly pastoral interests and affairs, to the jealousies and tensions of polygyny which are here not ventilated in accusations of sorcery and witchcraft, and always menaced by the precariousness of marriage in a society</page><page sequence="8">3I4 I. M. LEWIS where divorce is frequent and particularly easily obtained by men, the Somali married woman's lot offers little stability or security. It is scarcely surprising, therefore, that many women's ailments, whether accompanied by definite physical symptoms or not, should be so readily interpreted by them as possession by sar spirits which demand luxurious clothes, perfume, and delicate foods from their menfolk. It is only when these costly demands are met, and all the other expenses involved in the mounting of a cathartic dance ('beating the sar') directed by an expert female shaman, that the symptoms can be expected to disappear. Even then, relief from the affliction may be only temporary. Without instancing all the evidence I have collected on such cases, let me simply record here that in several of them the onset of this sprite affliction coin- cided with a husband's opening moves to marry an additional spouse, and that in every example known to me some grudge against her spouse was borne by the woman concerned. It scarcely requires the sophisticated forensic techniques of modern anthropology to discover what is involved here, and, very properly, Somali men draw their own conclusions. What the wives call sar possession, their husbands call malingering, and they interpret this affliction as yet another of the deceitful tricks employed by women against men. Men support this charge by alleging that the incidence of the disease is much higher amongst the wives of the wealthy than amongst those of the poor. This insinuation women in their turn counter with the simple sophistry that there are some sar sprites which attack the wealthy, and others which molest the poor. Despite this sociological view of the situation, men's attitudes are in fact ambivalent; they believe in the existence of these sar sprites, but with true Somali pragmatism they are very sceptical when their own womenfolk and their own pockets are affected. Depending upon the marital circumstances and the value which is placed upon the wife affected, the usual reaction is for the husband to reluctantly accept one or two bouts of this kind. But if the affliction becomes chronic, and the wife becomes a more or less regular member of a circle of sar devotees, save in exceptional circum- stances the husband's patience soon wears thin. If a good thrashing will not do the trick, there is always the threat of divorce, and unless the woman herself desires this, or is genuinely psychologically disturbed and cannot control her symptoms, this seems usually to work. Leaving aside the wider implications of membership of a regular association of female sar devotees, the point I want to stress here is that in general this character- istically woman's affliction operates amongst the Somali as a limited deterrent against the abuses of neglect and deprivation in a conjugal relationship which is heavily biased in favour of men. In a society which offers them little domestic security and very inadequately protects them otherwise from the pressures and exactions of men, women, I am arguing, may thus resort to spirit possession as a means both of airing their grievances obliquely and of gaining some satisfaction. This way of looking at the phenomenon immediately ranks it with such other modes of mystical retaliation as witchcraft and sorcery in societies with other cultural traditions and cosmologies. This may seem a big jump. But when the social nexus is fully considered, the analogy is, I think, justified, and it may perhaps seem more acceptable when it is remembered that in many societies witches in fact perform their dark acts by means</page><page sequence="9">SPIRIT POSSESSION AND DEPRIVATION CULTS 3I5 of spirit familiars. Thus in many cases there is not only a functional parallel between the effects of spirit possession and of witchcraft, but also an ideological one. I recognise, of course, that it is not the guilty husband but the aggrieved wife who in the Somali case is mystically afflicted. But, as I shall try to show presently, this difference between an oblique use of mystical power with, in effect, self-inflicted injury, and the more direct line of attack in witchcraft and sorcery is not so crucial as might at first appear. Finally, I mention very briefly the last context of Somali possession affliction. This primarily concerns adult men; and not so much a definable social category of men as simply psychologically disturbed individuals who, for one reason or another experience particular difficulties in bearing the pressures and burdens of their society. Just as men are regarded as the dominant sex and consequently less vulnerable than women, the spirits possessing these unfortunate individuals are considered to be particularly deadly. Again, since men hold the dominant role in the cult of Islam, it is appropriate that the powers involved here should be re- garded not merely as especially dangerous, but also as especially religious. They are in fact the spiritual analogues of human Moslem clerics, so I call them 'clerical sprites'. These clerical sprites, I hasten to add, are not a unique Somali aberration, but on the contrary belong to a category of spirits well-known in other Moslem countries and for the existence of which there is moreover scriptural warrant in the Quran.9 These four contexts of Somali spirit possession are connected by the common theme of confinement and deprivation which occurs in different ways in all of them. This is perhaps most evident in the case of the aggrieved wives where, to adopt current phraseology, spirits enter the 'sex-war'. Now the sar culture-complex with this emphasis is not confined to the Somali alone. It exists also in Ethiopia (as zar), where it reaches its greatest shamanistic elaboration and seems to have originated (Cerulli I923: 2); and it has spread not only into Somaliland but also into the northern Sudan, Egypt, and has even penetrated the sacred city of Mecca itself (Hurgronje I888-9). In Ethiopia its psychological and dramatic aspects have been described most recently, in the manner ofJane Harrison, by the French surrealist poet and ethno- grapher Michel Leiris (I958). But greater light on its social significance there is shed by the work of an American anthropologist, Simon Messing (I958; I959). Messing records how wives have used the cult in Somali fashion to extort economic sacrifices from their husbands by threatening a relapse when their demands were ignored. Much the same appears to be the case in Egypt; and in Cairo where the cult is prevalent, there is a particular shop which specialises in the sale of the appro- priate costumes and other regalia used in the zar ceremonies by the female 'brides' of the spirits (Kriss &amp; Kriss-Heinrich I962). This theme is even more explicitly displayed in the suburbs of Khartoum. Here a recent account reports that zar spirits possessing wives may not only demand gifts, including in one case gold teeth, but also roundly upbraid the latters' husbands in terms which would not be tolerated in other circumstances (Barclay I964: I98). 2-M.</page><page sequence="10">3I6 I. M. LEWIS IV These 'sex-war' aspects are by no means restricted to the zar-complex, but occur widely in spirit possession in a variety of societies and places. I cannot pretend to have made an exhaustive search of the literature but I record a few scattered examples. In African ethnography one of the earliest and best descriptions comes from Lindblom's study of the Akamba of east Africa (Lindblom I920: 229-40). Here a sharp distinction is drawn between the ancestral spirits which uphold morality and represent the on-going interests of their descendants, and other capricious spirits. These latter are typically of neighbouring tribes-Masai, Galla, and Wanyika, and include Europeans. They are not worshipped but frequently plague Kamba women who must then be exorcised. As with possession elsewhere, these afflicted women speak 'with tongues' in an obscure jargon-but despite the problems of communication, their demands are quite clear. What they seek is gifts and attention from their menfolk, usually husbands, each spirit asking for things appropriate to its provenance. Thus Swahili spirits demand embroidered Arab hats, and European spirits articles of European origin. Women make use of the cult to force their husbands to buy new skirts for them. In a poignant little case-history Lindblom records how a woman with a longing for meat could only gain her husband's consent to the killing of an animal by resort to possession in which her cravings were voiced by the invading spirit. Unfortunately, however, she made the mistake, once her desires were satisfied, of vaunting her successful deceit too openly and was sent back to her father by her outraged spouse. Parallel instances are reported from Tanzania where, some thirty years ago, Koritschoner describes the high incidence in women of an affliction popularly called 'devil's disease' in Swahili. Again, the possessing spirit, which manifests its presence by hysterical and other symptoms, demands gifts some of which reflect its provenance. Treatment is a fairly lengthy business, and involves not only the usual costly cathartic dances but also the presence for some time of the therapist within the family of the afflicted woman. In this enlightened therapy the afflicted woman is thus made to feel the centre of attention, and her husband may even be constrained to modify his behaviour towards her (Koritschoner I936). Again from east Africa, in an extremely interesting study of the Taita of Kenya, Grace Harris (I957) describes a similar women's possession affliction by spirits other than those of the main, morally endowed and male dominated cult, and functioning in a similar manner to exert pressure on men. Here an important element, present in many of the cathartic rites associated with these spirit afflictions, is the assumption by women of male postures and dress. Analogous phenomena have been described by several observers among the BaThonga (Junod I922) and Zulu (Krige 1936: 307; Gluckman I954) of South Africa; and in the case of the latter two, recent psychological studies are also available (Lee I950; Loudon I959). Traditionally amongst Junod's Thonga, women were afflicted by Zulu and other foreign spirits, and the Zulu women in turn by Thonga devils. In both cases there is the familiar pattern of hysterical and other manifestations, and requests for gifts and for the mounting of the cathartic dance paid for by the husband. Amongst the Zulu today, however, this affliction which is known locally as 'Bantu disease' and diagnosed by Lee as a form of</page><page sequence="11">SPIRIT POSSESSION AND DEPRIVATION CULTS 317 conversion hysteria, most commonly involves possession by Indian spirits and by the tokoloshe, those obscene little sprites with thickset bodies and huge penises. All this readily lends itself to straighforward Freudian interpretation, and Lee records cures effected on this basis. My interest here is in the institutionalised role of this Zulu possession cult in the sex-war. In this connection I note in passing Loudon's intriguing observation that the rise of these typically feminine disorders seems to have coincided with the decline of the traditional agricultural fertility rituals in which women exchanged their habitual role of submission for one of dominance. These now extinct rituals are amongst those referred to by Gluckman in his Frazer Lecture, Rituals of rebellion in south-east Africa (I952). Turning now to west Africa, similar elements to those we have been discussing may, I believe, be found in the Songhay cult of holey sprites and in that of the Hausa bori cult. For the Songhay, I admit, the evidence is not entirely clear. Jean Rouch (I960: I78 sqq.) records that possession by these holey spirits in this Islamised society is more frequently invoked as an explanation of illness in women than in men, although, as in many of the other cases we have been considering, men of low status may also be afflicted. Again, there is a whole family of these sprites, some associated with neighbouring peoples (such as the Hausa and Tuareg) and others with animals. A recent addition to this spirit host is that of European sprites who increasingly appear unbidden at the seances in which women play so important a part. Here there is a well-organised establishment of societies of mediums and shamans, in which the low-caste Sorko fisher-folk play a crucial role, and the usual dances, gifts and offerings. There is no explicit indication, however, that the cult offers women the direct means of exerting the pressure on their menfolk that we have discovered elsewhere. I suggest that further research may reveal that it does. The Hausa bori cult,Io which like that of zar has spread northwards into north Africa, is a similar though more elaborate affair. Here there is a great pantheon of some two hundred individually named sprites, related in various ways amongst themselves in a manner reminiscent of the gods of ancient Greece. These bori, according to Tremearne (I9I3), range in descending order of importance from the mighty 'King of the jinns' (Sarkin 'Aljan) to a little cluster of sprites known famili- arly as the 'Little Spots', which, despite their innocent-sounding name are held to be responsible not only for a number of minor ailments but also for smallpox. This bori pantheon is thus not merely a census of spiritual forces, but equally a medical dictionary, each sprite being connected with a group of symptoms (some of which overlap). Both amongst the Moslem Hausa in west Africa proper, and in its northern extension in Tunisia, Tripolitania, and Egypt, this cult is again predominantly one of women, women being the regular devotees in shamanistic exercises designed to exorcise the grounds of their ailments. But I believe that we can go further than this and bring some elements of this elaborate cult within our particular purview. A search of the scattered literature is not very rewarding: the most suggestive clues which do emerge are that the evil eye is believed to operate through the agency of bori sprites (Tremearne I914: I79), and that a despised and neglected wife is known as a bora, a term which Tremearne (I9I4: 395) connects with bori. I do not know whether this is a valid etymology or not. But a more recent observer records that the bori cult has in practice two main</page><page sequence="12">3I8 I. M. LEWIS aspects; one inside the Hausa compound, and the other outside it. It is the latter and wider cult which has hitherto received most attention from anthropologists. In the internal domestic cult, which has been so neglected, bori possession, involving only certain selected spirits of the total pantheon, appears to be used especially by junior co-wives against their senior colleagues and particularly against their husband, and figures prominently in disputes within the polygynous family. Here, as in the other cases we have examined, wives possessed by bori exact gifts and economic sacrifices from their husbands and in this fashion press their claims for attention and regard.II Finally, outside Africa, a more diligent search of the literature will, I think, yield further examples of the particular type of mystical sanction we have been discussing. Certainly, as I pointed out earlier, women, and other subject categories of person, figure prominently in many spirit cults elsewhere in the world and not least in our own shamanistic tradition where the sexual element is certainly by no means absent. One well-established non-African phenomen on which seems to fit the rubric we have been applying is that found amongst the polar Eskimos and other Siberian peoples and known usually as 'arctic hysteria'. This is a hysterical affliction mainly affecting women and is particularly prevalent in the harsh winter months in northern Greenland. Gussow (I960), who has recently interpreted this condition in Freudian terms, refers to the hysterical flights to which those affected are prone as an unconscious seductive manceuvre and invitation to male pursuit. It is, he argues, the refuge of those women who in situations of hardship and crisis seek loving reassurance. Stripped of its Freudian cadences, this interpretation suggests my own line of analysis. It is, moreover, particularly significant in this connection that this hysterical condition, which is generally attributed to spirit possession, plays a vital part in the selection, training and ritual performances of Siberian shamans-who are frequently women (Czaplicka I914: I69 sqq., 309-25).I2 V It must now be clear, I think, that we are concerned here with a widespread use of spirit possession, by means of which women and other depressed categories exert mystical pressures upon their superiors in circumstances of deprivation and frustration when few other sanctions are available to them. Of course, spirit possession is only one possible mystical mode, and one which operates obliquely in the sense that it is the aggrieved party which submits to affliction rather than seeking to inflict illness upon the real source of injury and deprivation. Witchcraft and sorcery are from this point of view other, more direct processes of retaliation and attack; and I do not attempt to answer the question why in certain societies one mode is favoured rather than another. Or, indeed, why in some cases both are found. It may be worth noting, however, that one specific characteristic of spirit possession is that, unlike at least some forms of witchcraft and sorcery, it appears usually to offer an explanation only of disease and illness. It does not generally explain external misfortunes, at least not directly, and this seems to follow logically from the inherent and specific nature of possession as an invasion of the person. Whether or not this will turn out to be a valid and significant distinction, there are important analogies between the two types of mystical sanction-spirit</page><page sequence="13">SPIRIT POSSESSION AND DEPRIVATION CULTS 3I9 possession, and witchcraft and sorcery-to which I have already referred and would like now to press further. It seems to me for instance, that in Nadel's analysis of Nupe witchcraft we find a kind of witchcraft converse to the enlistment by women of spirits in the 'sex-war' which has been our main theme so far. For here, through their enterprise in trade and commerce, which often makes their husbands financially indebted to them, it is women who get out of hand and cannot be brought to boot except by accusing them of being witches (Nadel i952). In pressing this analogy in the application of these different mystical processes, there is a further point which seems worth making. The best anthropological analyses of witchcraft and sorcery strongly emphasise the nexus of conflict which exists between the bewitched or ensorcered victim and the witch or sorcerer. They tend to neglect, however, how in pointing the finger of accusation at the witch or sorcerer, the victim also draws attention to himself This, I suggest, has the effect not merely of marshalling public opinion behind the victim in the manner of the typical witch hunt, but also of making himself, as victim, the centre of special care and consideration. This, at least, seems to be a common effect of the whole process which has been singularly neglected in witchcraft analysis. In so far emphasising the sanction and control aspect of the use thus made by women of spirit possession against men, I am not forgetting that other line of interpretation which sees in such phenomena the assertion ofthe interdependence of the sexes, and the conservation of the existing pattern of relations between them. This is the main emphasis of Gluckman's Rituals of rebellion, and reflects the traditional structural approach of Radcliffe-Brown. Thus for Gluckman such conflicts really represent disguised conservation and stability. This is also the main focus of emphasis in Grace Harris's interpretation of the Taita women's possession cults to which I referred earlier. She, like Gluckman, to use the latter's terminology, sees depressed women not as suffragettes but as passive subjects, bravely shouldering their man-imposed burdens, and only periodically reacting against them in a cathartic ritual acceptance of the established order. In a similar vein, Werbner (I964) has offered an elaborate analysis of Kalanga Shona women's spirit possession; where, although he does show how women use these powers to generate pressures, he argues (if I have understood him correctly) that this in the end is to the profit of men. Here, however, the cult in question is much more central to the upholding of the traditional tribal morality than is true of the peripheral cults from which I have drawn my conclusions about the special role of women's possession. In any case, I believe that the material I have so far presented on these peripheral cults supports my emphasis which is less on the conservative, status quo maintaining aspects than on the dynamic role of mystical sanctions in the war between the sexes. In short, my argument is that if in these traditionally male-dominated societies women are not always actually suffragettes, then they can readily become so when the circumstances are appropriate. I now refer for supporting evidence for this view to a recent study by Elizabeth Colson of the Tonga of Zambia.13 By contrasting the conservative, traditionalist, Valley Tonga with their more sophisti- cated and acculturated Plateau countrymen, and using historical evidence, Colson's material reveals what really is at stake in these women's deprivation cults. Amongst the Plateau Tonga, increasingly involved in the modem market economy of Zambia since the 1930's, and with local opportunities for earning</page><page sequence="14">320 I. M. LEWIS cash wages which do not require their menfolk to work extensively as absent migrant labourers, there has been a virtually parallel acculturation of men and of women. Moreover, the traditional pattern of relations between the sexes is one of equality rather than inequality (Colson i958: I37). Thus, like men, whether un- married or married, women participate freely in men's social activities and are not strongly hedged about with mystical or other restraints. In this situation possession by peripheral masabe spirits is today rare, and in so far as it exists, affects men and women equally. Amongst the Valley Tonga the situation is altogether different. Here, for long, men have participated through labour migration in the wider European-orientated world, while women have remained at home fascinated by the town delights and mysteries from which they have been excluded. It is these secluded and excluded wives who are regularly subject to possession by spirits which today characteristic- ally demand gifts that these women associate with their alluring urban counter- parts. As well as for gay cloths and luxury foods, one of the commonest demands of the spirits is for soap. This reflects a growing male sophistication and repugnance for the oil and ochre cosmetics which Valley women traditionally apply to their bodies, and a distinct preference by men for freshly bathed and fragrantly scented partners. It is in this cosmetic idiom that, through their possessing spirits, these rural women today call attention to their exclusion and neglect and seek to over- come it. In the past, their spirits desired men's garments and possessions. Thus it is that these women's deprivation cults mirror the changing interests and desires of those who succumb to possession. These ambitions and longings are no longer static if they ever truly were, and they cannot thus be completely contained or explained in the repetitive idiom of ritual rebellion. Equally the changing character and imagery of the possessing spirits, mirrors changing circumstances. To the foreign tribal and animal sprites which everywhere figure so prominently in these traditional spirit pantheons are added, while they are still novel and mysterious, such other alien powers as those manifest in aeroplanes and trains. Much the same occurs with spiritual forces of Christian mission origin which are equally readily assimilated in these peripheral women's cults. With these new accretions, reflecting new contacts and new experiences, some of the old spirits disappear. Thus, contrasting this record of these cults among the Valley Tonga with the position on the Plateau, it is clear how in the former case much of the traditional inequality between the sexes continues and so the cults continue, with modifications in the cast of invading spirits corresponding to changing experience of the world. For the Plateau Tonga, with their more liberal treatment of women, such possession of this type as exists continues to affect men and women equally. This makes sense only if we acknowledge the at least potential dynamism which I have stressed in these cults. Now let me take up another, but related theme. I have several times called attention to the fact that the cults with which we are mainly concerned here are peripheral in the sense that they do not embody the main moral code of the societies in which they occur. Thus, it seems more than merely semantically appropriate that many of the spirits which figure in them should represent and reflect peripheral contact with foreign peoples and tangential exposure to novel</page><page sequence="15">SPIRIT POSSESSION AND DEPRIVATION CULTS 32I experiences. But of much greater relevance at least to my argument, is their special connexion with women. For, whether or not they may be regarded as pawns in the marriage alliance games which Levi-Strauss' men play, there is no doubt that in a great many societies, and perhaps most, women are in fact treated as peripheral creatures. This I hasten to add is not some special feature limited to patrilineal societies: the Valley Tonga are not patrilineal, nor are many of the examples I have referred to. Here, I may perhaps be permitted to interpolate, we have again a demonstration of the unimportance, from many points of view, of these traditional descent categories with which anthropologists have so long and so unproductively wrestled in the search for fruitful correlations with other social phenomena. At last, at least some anthropologists'4 are beginning to realise that descent is a very shaky peg upon which to hang securely many important social phenomena: and that great en- crusted heart of traditional anthropology is trembling, or should be. For the peripherality of women is, irrespective of descent, a general feature of all societies where men hold a secure monopoly of the major power positions and deny their partners effective jural rights. Here, of course, there is an obvious and vital contradiction, since whatever the jural position of women, it is they who are essential to the perpetuation of life and of men. It is they who produce and rear children and play a major role in their early training and education. Thus the treatment of women as peripheral creatures flatly contradicts their fundamental biological importance and, in social terms, clashes with their deep commitment to a particular society and culture. Hence, if it is in terms of the exclusion of women in social and political life and their jural deprivation in relation to men that we should seek to understand their prominence in spirit possession, we must also recognise that these cults, expressing as they do sexual tensions, are yet allowed to exist by men. Here it seems to me possible that this tolerance by men of these cults as well as the ritual licence and blessing also allowed to women more generally, may reflect a shadowy recognition of this contradiction between the status of women and their commitment to society. Such considerations, naturally, do not fully explain the existence of these cults. Up to a point, as with other mystical explan- ations of illness, the use of spirit possession as a way of classifying and treating disease implies ignorance of, disregard for, or dissatisfaction with, the explanations of modern medical science. It need hardly be added that it also requires a certain prevalence of illness. VI Let me conclude this, as it must seem to some, excessive concentration on female ailments, by trying to draw together other strands of this discussion into a wider schema of spirit possession. Nadel (I946), as many other writers on the subject before and since, has drawn attention not merely to the changing, flexible, and adaptive character of spirit possession cults which we have seen exemplified among the Tonga, but also to their frankly innovative potential epitomised in the 'speaking with tongues' of prophets. Let us note also that not only have we been concen- trating on peripheral cults connected with women, but that here and there socially deprived categories of men, as well as of maladjusted individual men, have also</page><page sequence="16">322 I. M. LEWIS slipped in. Indeed, in the zar cult in Ethiopia, as with the bori and holey cults, and others elsewhere, there is evidence of a progressively widening spirit catchment. Not only worien, but all the rejected and despised-whether they belong to distinguishable subordinate social categories, or as with Somali men smitten by derical sprites, represent individual deviants-appear increasingly to be absorbed into such cults. Thus in Ethiopia, whereas in the past women were the main devotees, now ex-slaves and people of servile origin and subordinate status generally, seem to find in chronic possession and regular membership of the cult organisation a measure of security and opportunities for the enhancement of their position (Messing I959: 33 I). Membership of the zar club itself offers some emancipation from frustrating traditional confinements, and a new trend is also evident toward upward mobility in terms of the increasingly exalted rank of the spirits which possess people of low status. In this connexion, and especially with regard to the relief offered to those devo- tees who are genuinely psychologically disturbed, I do not wish to minimise the positive therapeutic functions seemingly fulfilled by the regular use of cathartic and other expressive techniques in these cults. 5 Where possession is peripheral, of course, one cannot say, as Marvin Opler (I959: II2) in effect says of the Indian peyote cult, that it is the mescaline of the masses. But, even where such cults play a subsidiary role, there is evidence that, as well as in some cases anticipating Freud in their recognition of unconscious emotions and motivation,i6 many tribal peoples have developed curative techniques in their shamanistic therapy which modern psychotherapy has only recently rediscovered. But I am afraid that I am straying from my wider schema or spectrum of posses- sion cults. At one end of such a spectrum lie the phenomena which have been our main concern here. They can be characterised as forms of hysterical possession which are largely institutionalised as a means by which women, and sometimes other subject categories, are enabled to protect their interests and prefer their claims and ambitions through occasional rather than chronic affliction. Here, there is little formal elaboration of a regular shamanistic cult as such, and the range of spirits involved may be relatively modest. Spirit possession here, as we have found it among the Somali, Kamba and Zulu etc., has much the same effect as witch- craft and sorcery elsewhere, although it expresses tensions more obliquely. In the next band on the spectrum, spirit possession becomes more the regular, stereotyped, and thoroughly institutionalised mode of entry into a specifically shamanistic cult group, with an organised leadership and following. Although still peripheral to the main religious cult in terms of which men's actions are evaluated and the universe interpreted, it appeals primarily to women and to those of other excluded and subordinate categories, as well as to individual deviants. Here more than in the previous case where the accent was primarily on exorcism, there is a true and regular cult of spirits which may be highly elaborate in character and encompass a vast pantheon of powers. This is the situation in Singapore, in Haitan voodoo (Metraux I959), and equally well-represented amongst the Moslem Hausa and Songhay, and the Moslem and Christian Ethiopians, to say nothing of parallel cults in classical antiquity. In these examples it is primarily through regular membership of the cult organisation with its prominent psycho- dramatic features that adherents gain assurance, security and enhancement of</page><page sequence="17">SPIRIT POSSESSION AND DEPRIVATION CULTS 323 status, even if only vicariously. Although essentially not the bearers of the main morality of the society in which they are found, such cults may have great social as well as psychological importance. Here I refer to much more than the shaman's role as fortune-teller, diviner, healer and mediator, significant though these functions undoubtedly are. Think, for example, of the fascinating, though as yet hardly explored, social implications of the Hausa bori cult with its emphasis not only on the oldest trade of all, but also upon prosperity in trade in general; and hence its vital mystical connexion with the founding and success of market-centres, where, at the salons of the richly adorned bori courtesans, nobles as well as commoners vie with one another for favour in the highly stylised idiom of Hausa praise-songs. Such elaborate possession cults as this, next shade into true prophetic movements, where the possessing mediums and shamans not only answer recurring problems within their own cultural tradition, but in response to new stimuli and pressures, announce messianic revelations and inaugurate spiritually inspired religions with a new and wider appeal and a strong embodiment of moral teaching. The pre- cipitating circumstances and the salient characteristics of such 'religions of the oppressed' as Lanternari calls them, have received a great deal of attention, both within and outside the Christian tradition.'7 Thus it is scarcely necessary to enume- rate examples, beyond pointing out that these include such embryonic and inchoate forms as anti-witchcraft movements and cargo cults as well as the messianic cults of Christianity and Islam. What may be of greater significance is to note how often, and perhaps generally, such religions stress eschatological notions of a morally evaluative after-life. The moral order is sustained not merely by prosperity and happiness in this life, but more significantly by the conferment of these rewards in heaven. Finally, there are those thoroughly established religions where such a central messianic revelation of moral teaching has shrunk to the proportions of a mere myth of creation and of the origins of man's misery. Here, religion has been so completely assimilated in social life, and so firmly embedded in morality, that the eschatological tradition has also lost its savour. Yet, such religions are still perme- ated by the notion of spirit, regularly manifest in the defence of morality and piety through possession afflictions. Undercurrents of the messianic tradition continue in the occasional emergence of revitalising prophets inveighing against decadence and decay. At this end of the spectrum I am sketching we clearly have the religion of the Old Testament as well as those of the Nuer (Evans-Pritchard I956) and the Dinka (Lienhardt I96I) where, in the convenient paradox of the one and the many, the spirits unequivocally represent man's experience of order and disorder in his universe. This typological series traces the increasing involvement of prophets in their surrounding social order until the point is reached where their revolutionary fervour is almost completely dissipated. This implies that the type of religion which celebrates an accepted code of public morality can as readily develop from, as precede a messianic tradition. For it seems that in the history of religions it is often possible to trace trends and developments in either direction through the various phases and points of emphasis in our simple schema of spirit possession and inspiration. And it is also perhaps necessary to stress, obvious though this is, that to a variable degree several of the phases which we have separately distinguished may</page><page sequence="18">324 I. M. LEWIS in fact co-exist within a particular religious system at any point in time. Thus, to take a very simple example, although the principal emphasis in Somaliland is on the engagement of possession in the 'sex-war' in the particular manner I have indicated, there is also in this case a less significant, but none the less co-existent organisation of spirit medium coteries. VII Without attempting any very strict application of this model to the data discussed in this lecture, it may be worthwhile to indicate something more of the wider temporal and circumstantial setting of some of the cults with which we have dealt. Thus, as Cerulli argues (I923: 2), the zar cult in Ethiopia today may well represent the ancient Cushitic religion centring on a sky-god displaced by Christianity and Islam and relegated to the status of a peripheral cult. In Somaliland, however, there is no direct linguistic evidence for this assumption and the cult seems more securely regarded as an intrusive element: this certainly is the case with the affliction attributed to clerical sprites which has made its appearance within the last generation or so. In Arabia, the northern Sudan, and Egypt the zar cult is likewise intrusive and of scarcely more than a century's standing. In its own local setting, the bori cult is similarly generally regarded as the displaced traditional religion of the pre-Islamic Hausa and there seems no good reason to dispute this view. In Haiti a rather similar relationship seems to have existed over several centuries between the slave and the later peasant cult of voodoo and of Christianity (Metraux I959). It seems probable that such displaced and peripherally relegated cults may provide the kind of institutional and inspirational continuity which, in appropriate historical circumstances, enables new messianic cults to develop and eventually to entrench themselves at the centre of religious morality. This surely is one of the principal themes in the history of Christianity, and if the prophets of the Old Testament unquestionably herald Christ's messianic mission, the ultimate entrench- ment of this religion in public morality in our own society and the implicit dis- regard of eschatology except as a convenient metaphor for sanctioning good conduct bring the cycle full circle. For the main public cult of nineteenth and twentieth century Christianity seems more in the morality-upholding spirit of the Old than of the call to salvation of the New Testament. Here we should also note the explicit refutation of the Church's traditional eschatology in the doctrines advanced by modern Christian apologists, who argue that heaven and hell are not realities in the traditional sense, but existential states of mind. By way of concluding, I would only add that we should also look more specifically at our own tradition of peripheral spirit possession. In our religious history, the establishment of the Holy Spirit as the sole orthodox source of divine inspiration automatically disenfranchised all other spiritual claims which could not thus be acceptably authenticated, and exposed them to charges of fraud and traffic with the Devil with consequences which we all know. This is the official view, exposed with characteristic casuistry, in the late fifteenth century Malleus maleficarum written by the Dominican authorities Kramer and Sprenger, which, for at least two centuries, seems to have served as the principal ecclesiastical guide on</page><page sequence="19">SPIRIT POSSESSION AND DEPRIVATION CULTS 325 such matters. Although the increasingly liberal treatment by the Church of such possession as was assigned to the work of Satan, and the rise of secularism and of modern science in the nineteenth century naturally fostered a widening of scepti- cism in peripheral spirit possession, the phenomenon did not entirely disappear. Indeed, in the Victorian era, and especially after the challenge to orthodox theology presented by the publication in I859 of Darwin's Origin of species, a new upsurge of spiritualism claiming, and to some extent receiving scientific approval, made its appearance. This was the heyday of the Fox sisters and of the celebrated English medium Florence Cook, when, as Trevor Hall aptly puts it, 'as many heads as tables were being turned and the various interpretations put upon the mysterious dances of the furniture reflected the state of mind of those who advanced them. Spiritualists were certain that the tables moved under the influence of spirits; the clergy thought that this was probably true, but whether these discarnate en- tities were good or bad, angelic, or demonic, was open to question' (Hall I962: xi). Although, as the sustained current of spiritualist seances and publications indicates, spirit possession in its traditional guise is, with other marginal mystical practices, by no means defunct today,I8 it can hardly claim the widespread interest and following which it attracted amongst our grandparents. This decline seems to coincide fairly closely with the rise of modern psychology and psychoanalysis. And no one, I fancy, will question that many of the medical symptoms associated with spiritualism in our own past as well as in traditional societies are today treated on the psychologist's couch. But perhaps this analogy can be pressed further. For,, at least in psychoanalysis, not only is the mode of entry to the profession broadly similar to that of the shaman's spiritual travail and apprenticeship, but the treat- ment situation of the patient is implicitly and increasingly explicitly psycho- dramatic in its essential characteristics. Certainly in the functional approach in psychological medicine which is so widely adopted today we have an inter- pretation of psychosomatic disorders, and, according to some practitioners of more serious mental maladies, which relates the patient's symptoms to his personal predicament by the same kind offunctional logic that I have followed in this lecture. In suggesting this comparison, I am not of course arguing that all psychological illnesses can properly be regarded as responses to deprivation, nor am I proposing that the whole of modern psychotherapy be viewed as a deprivation cult. The parallel seems to me best restricted to the incidence and treatment of the neurotic disorders, and particularly to psychosomatic and hysterical afflictions. Whatever other types of malady may be catered for in tribal spirit possession cults, these stand out as the salient and most widely reported symptoms associated with peripheral possession. If the analogy I am proposing has some substance, it is there- fore in this field of mental disorders that we should seek correlations between these afflictions and deprivation. Unfortunately, but not surprisingly in view of the difficulties involved in maintaining common standards of diagnosis, detailed statistical information on the epidemiology of mental illness in western societies is not readily available. Nevertheless, two recent studies contain suggestive data. In a recent examination of mental illness in New Haven, Connecticut, Hollings- head &amp; Redlich (I958) have found a statistically significant inverse relationship between psychosomatic disorders and hysterical reactions on the one hand, and social class on the other. Disorders in these categories are most prevalent amongst</page><page sequence="20">326 I. M. LEWIS the most socially deprived sections of the community. More recently, an analysis of diagnoses in neurosis cases from a sample of general practices in this country showed an overwhelming predominance of female disorders: the ratio of female to male neurotic patients is two to one.'9 In the present state of confusion in what it has now become fashionable to call trans-cultural psychology, it would be extremely naive to place too great reliance on such figures or to accept the parallel I have drawn without reservations. All I am suggesting, therefore, is that there is something worth considering further here. In thus looking to psychology, as I think anthropologists must increasingly do (at least if we want to know the analogues in our own society of the syndromes which we examine and analyse in other cultures), I realise that I may attract the opprobrium of those who are still indissolubly wedded to the functionalism of Radcliffe-Brown. But lest I be too hastily condemned, let me be more explicit. In the psychologist's explanation of bizarre behaviour in terms of unconscious motivation, projection, conversion, and the rest, I do not hope to find a final explanation of socially institutionalised behaviour which closes the door to anthropological analysis. On the contrary, all I wish to do is to be able to classify and hold constant a range of similar symptoms which are dealt with in a wide diversity ofinstitutionalised ways in different societies. And, if you still have doubts, although this may not serve to quell them, I would only say in conclusion that Malinowski, at least, was not too much troubled by scruples of this kind. This readiness to cross frontiers and to open his mind to other disciplines is surely one of the most enduring marks of his genius. NOTES 'For an admirably comprehensive bibliography of works published prior to I9so, see Bouteiller (I950: 327-65). 2 Cf Firth's wide-ranging discussion of the effects and implications of the observer's personal bias in religious sociology (Firth I959). 3 White suggests that the high incidence of these possession afflictions amongst Luvale women is, in this context, connected with the practice of virilocal marriage which separates a wife from her natal kin and prevents her from regularly participating in offerings made to her own ancestors (White I96I: 48). These spirit possession afflictions have thus had the effect of reminding women of their kin allegiances and help to maintain matrilineal solidarity. 4 For a fuller discussion see Lewis (in press). s The transition from the rigid traditional attitude to the modem explicit recognition of love is clearly shown in many of the poems of Ilmi Bownderi (c. I908-I938) who is generally regarded as the first major Somali poet to compose works in the classical style treating this theme directly. The following lines addressed to the woman he loved but who would not marry him, refer directly to the forms of possession discussed here: Rapt in deceitful trance, I thought that I was sleeping with her, But it was only a jinn counterfeiting her image, I tried to catch her by the hand, but the place beside me was empty. When I discovered that it was alone I was striving, I woke up abruptly, having tossed from side to side, And like a prowling lion, I rumpled my bed clothes, Attacking and pounding them, as if it were they who had caused my deprivation And like a hero against whom men have combined to oppose, I covered my face, I was humbled like the boy who, guarding his people's camels, has them seized from him, I felt disgraced like a woman to whom the words 'I divorce you' had been spoken, It is degrading to yearn for what you cannot have, Alas, alas, how disaster has overtaken me.

I use the word 'cleric' as a general purpose term for the various Moslem holy men and religious functionaries who, though not necessarily part of any ecclesiastical hierarchy, figure so prominently in all Islamic societies. 7 For fuller details on the procedure of exorcism see Lewis (in press). 8 There are obvious analogies here with such exotic phenomena as the so-called 'Wiitiko psychosis' found amongst Cree and Ojibwa Indians in the northern forestland of Canada. Like the Somali camel-boys' sar, this affliction mainly affects men, and in this case, those who have spent long periods alone in the frozen forest in an unsuccessful quest for food (Parker I960: 603). Whatever its psychological status, this appears to be a parallel cultural phenomenon, associated with physical and social isolation and deprivation, and explained in terms of possession by a monster spirit called Wiitiko. 9 For accounts of these in the Sudan and north Africa, see Tremeame (I914) and Wester- marck (I926). IO The best published sources on the bori cult are: Tremeame (I9I3; I9I4); Greenberg (I946); Smith, Mary (I954) and Smith, M. G., (I957; I962). II Mr Michael Onwuejeogwu, personal communication. I am also grateful for helpful comments from Dr F. W. Parsons and Mallam Esa, of the School of Oriental and African Studies, London. I2 Wallace (I96I), argues that arctic hysteria (in some areas called pibloktoq) is the result of a calcium deficiency in Eskimo diet. This view, however, does not satisfactorily account for the differential sex incidence of the affliction. Wallace's assertion that the syndrome is not explained by Eskimo in terms of spirit possession appears to contradict the evidence presented by Czap- licka and other authorities. I3 Colson (in press). I am most grateful to Dr Colson for permission to quote from this as yet unpublished material. I4 Cf. Leach (I96I) and Lewis (I965). IS Wallace (I959) has recently most interestingly argued that prevailing trends in psycho- therapy may be related to socio-cultural factors. In social systems with a 'high level of organisa- tion' the emphasis in therapy tends to be on expressive catharsis, whereas in those with a 'low level of organisation' the bias is towards control therapy (with ego or superego reinforcement). Thus, according to Wallace, in traditional Iroquois society prior to I65o therapy was mainly of the expressive kind associated with shamanistic rituals. Two hundred years later, however, after the misery and dislocation entailed by colonisation, the emphasis had shifted towards 'control' psychotherapy associated with puritanical prophetic movements in which con- fession played an important part. I6 See, e.g., Fortes (I959), Horton (I96I) and Walace, (I96I: 28I sqq). I7 Prominent amongst recent synoptic treatments of the subject are: Thrupp (I962) and Lanternari (I963). I8 For a recent study of shamanistic practices associated with healing in rural France, see Bouteiler (I950: I99-248) and in rural Italy, Penna (I963). I9 See Shepherd et al. (I964; in press). This differential sex incidence is also evident, though less extreme, in the Registrar General's figures for hospitalisation in cases of mental illness in this country. On the basis of the I959 figures, Little (I965) has calculated 'expectancy rates' which indicate that 7.f4% of men and II -I % of women can expect to be admitted for treatment to a mental hospital once during their lives.
