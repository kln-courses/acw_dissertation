<plain_text><page sequence="1">CAUSALITY, WILL AND TIME NATHANIEL LAWRENCE I JL he problem of the freedom of the will, in its most usual form, actually relies upon two assumptions: (1) that nature is to be conceived mechanically, i.e., under the metaphor of "machine," and (2) that "nature" embraces all that there is, or at least includes man in all of his aspects. Given the two assumptions we now wish to ask, "Is the human will free?" The answer should be quite clear. If the metaphor of the machine is adequate to nature in that the parts of nature, however complicated, stand in sets of invariant relationships to one another in the same way that parts of an idealx machine would be related to one another, and further if all of man is included in "nature," then men do not act independently. All human decisions can, on principle at least, be analyzed into their causal components. If nothing of man is outside nature, and nature is essentially a machine, then man is not free. The conclusion is analytic and virtually trivial. Any quibbling about the conclusion can arise only through ignoring one of the postulates, or openly attacking it. Much classical philosophy simply does not accept pos tulate (1). For one thing, there is some question as to whether the modern notion of a "machine," as the term is most frequently encountered, has any counterpart in pre-Christian Greek thought at all. Aristotle, for instance, considered the making of human artifacts as a mere extension of natural processes. The machine would thus be like nature (having, however, the ends for which it comes into being external to itself) but hardly vice-versa. One can imagine a learned man of Aristotle's time confronting us: 1 It is important to notice that the machine itself has to be idealized, since in an actual machine the invariance of the mechanical behavior i? always relative to some practical margin of error or "tolerance."</page><page sequence="2">CAUSALITY, WILL AND TIME 15 "You call us anthropomorphic in our conception of the Gods. However you adapt a portion of natural fact to your own ends; the finished result you call a machine, and then you use this result as a model for understanding nature." Aristotle's nature is like a "doctor doctoring himself"; Plato's world soul is problemati cally immanent in its created world. Nature is not inanimate matter in motion. Nature is alive. The problem of the freedom of the will doesn't occur, because postulate (1) never is con ceived. No Christian philosophy is bothered by the problem of the freedom of the will in its most common form. The reason that this is so is that the Christian view of man discards postulate (2), or rather, cannot accept it. It may verge on the acceptance of (1) and thereby become plunged into controversy of its own about freedom of the will. Thus the period of flourishing of the extreme form of mechanistic determinism in the theory of nature coincides considerably with the heyday of the Puritans. But of course this is no mere coincidence. However, the most gloomy Calvinist did not see in man's unconditional dependence on God the same thing at all which his non-theist counterpart saw in man's total en meshment in nature. To be sure, man's will is radically defective, and this by moral inheritance from Adam. Men can not "choose" the good because they can not see it. And this moral pall lies on all human action, fatally tincturing it. But there are no auton omous and immovable laws of nature. God's grace, which is the expression of his love, can fall on any man, and this grace will illuminate his life, liberating him. The Puritan casts a hopeful look at the text : you shall know the truth and the truth will make you free. As a mere natural being man is not only not free; he is doomed. But his nature is susceptible of supernatural overhaul. The great portion?if not all?of the views which reject the determinism of the will could, I believe, be grouped under the rejection of either one or the other of the above two postulates. In what follows I should like to ignore postulate (2) and consider postulate (1). The principal weakness of this postulate, I suspect, is an assumption which underlies it, namely that our basic conception of cause is that which is derived from the examination of nature.</page><page sequence="3">16 NATHANIEL LAWRENCE This is a cardinal blunder. It is, for one thing, quite non empirical. The first conception we have of cause is surely that of causal agency, that is, of an agent in action. This is true of men both as individuals and in societies. The animism of earlier philo sophies, sophisticated survivals of which are to be discovered in Plato and Aristotle, the animism of the young child, and that observable in the religious practices of so-called contemporary primitives, all seem to argue for the genetic primacy of the notion of cause as being that of agency, where agency is conceived under the metaphor (at least) of human purpose. Aristotle's "doctor" is a case in point. The savage palliates the spirits of nature, and the child complains that the nasty old wagon tripped him. The only difference between the child, indeed, and the furious adult who kicks his stalled automobile, as if it were a wayward mule, is that the latter will readily admit that his actions are founded on impulsive postulates with regard to natural fact which he would, in a calmer moment, deny. The notion of mechanical agency, of action without an actor, is a very sophisticated one, not readily come by, either in the history of peoples or in the development of a single individual. Whether or not it is the correct one is temporarily irrelevant. What I wish to urge is that the notion of cause is genetically ?from the point of view of its origins?the notion of agency, that is of the activity of a more or less purposeful agent. The im mediate and primary acquaintance with the root conception of cause is through awareness of oneself as volitionally effective. The story of the modification of this conception is the history of the development of the consciousness of nature. The angry adult often exposes the simple origins of his conception of cause. When the notion of impersonal mechanical agency supervenes upon the root conception, certain modifications appear that result in the vague and highly figurative notion of physical "force," "energy," and the like. This notion of energy is a qualification proper to the derived view of mechanical natural causation, and is not appropriate to the fundamental conception of agency from which the mechanical conception is derived. If, then, we return to the basic conception of purposeful agency, it is entirely bootless to demand its credentials in terms of "energy" or " force" involved,</page><page sequence="4">CAUSALITY, WILL AND TIME 17 since these are among the characteristics which differentiate the mechanical notion from its ancestor. The lack of use or limited use of the idea of "force" in the conception of the will as causal does that conception no harm. Descartes' speculations about the pineal gland were needless. Hume's criticisms3 are wide of the mark. The mistaken idea that our primary conception of cause is that of empirical mechanical agency leads us to another blunder, closely related to the above blunder and more directly pertinent to the problem of the freedom of the will. Here the classical figure is Hume. Hume was, of course, quite right in showing that the necessity of so-called causal connections is indemonstrable. But the failure in the attempt to demonstrate the necessity of alleged causes in observed nature is only a catastrophe to the conception of cause because that conception itself is framed in terms of the metaphor of the machine. Necessary connection plays no part in the judgment of the will as causally effective. If I will to move my paralyzed hand? to choose a favorite example from Hume? and can not, it is not that the category of cause and effect is inapplicable but that it is negatively applied. The agency, the will, ought to be effective, but in this case it isn't. The inapplicability of a category is quite different from its negative application. I do not come from such an experience convinced that the will has no causal function but only that there are limits?some of which are idiosyncratic?to its effectiveness. Hume's example is briefly engaging because it chooses a situation that is not normal, but its informative value is not different from Mohammed's discovery about mountains: that there is no use in willing them to come to you. Such a failure does not require that we deny the role of cause to the will. Again, the will, conceived as a unitary cause, may have a variety of effects. No failure or variation is possible for the natural cause. A variation in the consequence of a natural "cause" usually constitutes grounds for depriving it of its status of cause (for those events which it formerly preceded or abutted). The reason for this situation is fairly obvious. The effort to dis 2 E.g., those in the Treatise, ed. of 1777, Bk. I, Pt. Ill, Sec. XIV.</page><page sequence="5">18 NATHANIEL LAWRENCE cern regularity in the order of nature frequently leads to a con ception of nature under the metaphor of a machine. The machine has no whims, purposes, or options. Mechanical causation must be manifest as necessary connection because machines always work in the same way, according to the principles and parts built into them. There is no place here to evaluate this metaphor, nor would it be fair to assign it unequivocal status in Hume's thought. Hume himself, of course, speculates on the metaphors of both "plant" and "animal" for the natural universe, in the Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion. However, the point to be made is that, even allowing the mechanical metaphor unlimited applica tion in the realm of natural fact, we are under no obligation to transfer its peculiar aspects of necessary connection or absolute regularity (if these be different from one another) to the causality of the will. Volitional causality, whether or not it is the parent idea of cause, is a demonstrably distinct one. Just as energy and force belong to the machinery of mechanical causation, so also does the notion of unexcepted regularity. But in the conscious ness of volition nothing makes us more aware of the?in a common use of the term?causal character of volition than a failure of the will to realize a purpose or its successful realization of a new pur pose.8 A simple consideration will illustrate the above remarks nicely. In natural causation, to be sure, if I believe I have dis covered causal efficacy, I expect that efficacy to be manifest in the future. If it is not, then I deny what I formerly affirmed, namely that I have observed an instance of causal efficacy. But now suppose I do a difficult handstand, solve a mathematical prob lem, or gain the rapt attention of my students. If in the future I fail in these, do I doubt that my will was causally efficacious in the past? Not for a moment. The conceived past in the observa tion of nature is one in which an alleged cause can be exposed 8 It will be noticed that great clusters of problems have been bypassed in order to make a little progress with the problem in hand. For instance it is very debatable whether or not one should allow the term "cause"? for philosophical purposes?to range over a universe of discourse including objects, events (Hume treats of both indiscriminately), and "faculties" or "functions."</page><page sequence="6">CAUSALITY, WILL AND TIME 19 as an impostor, upon the appearance of a single refuting instance. The directly experienced past which includes the awareness of volitional achievement cannot be altered by the future course of events. Conversely, past and present volitional efficacy guarantee no repetition in the future. Could Tensing and Hilary climb Everest again, even under "identical" weather conditions and over the "same" terrain? If at this point it is urged that this argument is engaged in comparing incomparables, namely physical events and/or objects as causes, with wills or acts of will, the response is that this may well be so. The "will" as unitary or as some vaguely conceived "function" is very problematic indeed. Yet if anything is de signated by these vague terms it is at least that area from which? however obscurely?the conception of cause appears. To summarize: The denial of the freedom of the will?in its non-religious form?rests on (1) making nature a machine and then (2) placing man in the machine. But there seems to be good reason to suppose that the primary conception of cause arises from the awareness of volitional effectiveness, that this root notion is then transferred to the explication of the way events are related in observable nature, under the qualifications of imper sonality and machine regularity. This is a complicated derivative idea whose salient features are not applicable to the will con ceived as causal. The "necessities" of nature, if such there be, do not impugn the freedom of the will. How does the above discussion stand with respect to our two postulates? It does not really attack the first postulate; rather it attacks the conjunction of the two. Choose the con ception of nature as a machine, if you like; you will reap many profits. But then, do not insert man into nature so conceived. Or, conversely, place man in nature, by all means; but then, watch the metaphors in your explication of nature, to be sure that they are broad enough to include not only observed fact but felt experience. Datum-wise, the "existence" of the self is very dif ferent from the "existence" of the world "out there." If we are successful in bringing the two ideas of existence into one inclusive conception, it will not be by committing the solipsist fallacy of supposing that the "out there" is really only a part of the "in</page><page sequence="7">20 NATHANIEL LAWRENCE here," nor by committing the converse fallacy?which often takes the form of mechanism?of supposing that the "in here" is merely a part of the "out there." II One of the principal reasons that our conception of cause is so often centered in the idea of impersonal mechanism is that the examination of nature is partly stimulated by the desire to control the future. The identification of natural causes renders nature more manipulable, or at least foreseeable. We want surety that the future will be like the past. Without having to enquire in any detail what "natural" causes are, we may say that if there are natural causes the future will be like the past. An attack on either the existence or the demonstrability of natural causes is often thought to be an attack on the existence or demonstrability, as the case may be, of a future which will be like the past. In view of his remarks on chance and "our ignorance of the real cause of any event" 4 it seems un likely that Hume's scepticism carried him beyond some proposition such as this: "Since the presence of causes in nature is indemon strable, so also is any justification of the proposition that the future will be like the past." This is, of course, quite different from arguing that there arc no causes in nature. But, even then, either Hume is virtually committing the fallacy of denying the antecedent, or else his underlying assumption must be put in this way: "If and only if we can demonstrate that there are natural causes can we demonstrate that the future will be like the past." I have tried to show that the basic conviction about natural causes here is that they operate within a "machine." Withdraw the metaphor of the machine and you withdraw, I believe, the basis for the usual attack on the demonstrability of the proposition that the future will be like the past. The conclusion that we cannot demonstrate that the future will be like the past is based on a dispensable premise. This is, of course, not to say that it is * Enquiry, end of Sec. V and beginning of Sec. VI.</page><page sequence="8">CAUSALITY, WILL AND TIME 21 false, but rather that it is unfounded. In the remainder of this section I should like to show that it is also false. What is expected of the world by someone who claims that the future will be like the past? Certainly not that the future will be or is wholly predictable. Hume's remarks on eggs would not startle the average breakfaster greatly. In fact, the way the average breakfaster looks at the unpredictability of eggs is that you can predict it. Variations in eggs will tend to confirm his suspicion that the future will go on being like the past, whether or not the confirmation is legitimate. To be sure, if the salt shaker that he used to salt his eggs yesterday dribbled out ink today or a white crystalline solid that had no taste at all, the effect would be jolting, but his general conviction about the future would, I think, be unshaken. Let us stir up his world a bit more. Let the salt shaker dribble out ink which on contact with his eggs changes them to roses. And let the roses be flaming hot to the touch, so that the rose-image associations are all contraverted. If we continue to tilt his world through a series of disorders, we may threaten his sanity. He may approach the future with a frightened wariness which shows that he doesn't think the future will be so much like the past as it had been formerly. What I am trying to suggest is that the appearance of surprises?to be more serious let us say surprises in the history of science?does not challenge the conviction that the future will be like the past. Nor do I think that the infrequency of these surprises accounts for their ineffectiveness against our conviction about the future. Rather I believe it is that what we mean by "the future will be like the past" is, in a sense, not subject to experiential refutation, al though it is dependent upon experience for its original for mulation. As a rule, those who urge that there is no way in which experience can warrant the proposition that the future will be like the past also indicate no way in which experience could lead us to abandon it.8 We might be tempted to suppose, then, that the 5 I have never been able to understand why theses which can not be "empirically verified," but also can not be empirically disconfirmed, should lose their claim upon human intelligence, especially where their</page><page sequence="9">22 NATHANIEL LAWRENCE proposition holds a peculiar place in our theories of experience, unlike?for instance?the proposition that there are craters on the far side of the moon, but also unlike the proposition that there is one God in three persons. Let us see what we can do to scramble the world in such a way that "the future will be like the past" can be torn down. Suppose we send our hapless breakfaster careening through space, with a kaleidoscope of sensory data of a completely novel sort. Or let the data be even qualitatively distinct in kind from the familiar data of the five senses. Let us throw everything in the nature of a report from the outside world into utter disorder, random chaos. Let the breakfaster be thrown back upon ap parently "internal" resources alone for any concept of familiarity. We must still grant him some minimal order in order to grant him conscious experience, if it be only his own ordering aware ness through some time of some datum, which then takes up its ordered place in his memory. What I should like to suggest is that the idea of the concrete lapse of time always entails the idea of order, and that this order is based upon similarity. The more precise we become about the natural world, the more evident this fact; yet the more we in vestigate the origins of subjective time, the more difficult it is to discover the basis of similarity and order. What the ordered regularities are that give rise to the sense of time when the ex ternal world is cut off is very difficult to assess. The man in sol itary confinement and the dungeon victim are said to lose all sense of time; yet I think that what is meant is that they lose their explanatory power is high. The claim that they are meaningless not only rests on an (admittedly) narrow interpretation of "meaning," but is itself not liable to confirmation. When this charge is made, the defenders of the claim modestly reply that such a definition of meaning is merely a "resolve," a "decision," or the like, and in itself neither true nor false. The piracy of the term "meaning" thus is supposed to render legitimate the caricature of the terms "true" and "false." The inevitable outcome, moreover, is to limit the term "experience" also to a degree which would have shocked even the classical empiricists, who were much more wary of dogmatism than were their successors. The whole procedure is one which evidently rests its appeal on nonempirical grounds, but does not make clear what these grounds are. But such considerations can not be pursued further, since they carry us away from the point in hand.</page><page sequence="10">CAUSALITY, WILL AND TIME 23 grasp on the external cues which exhibit the passage of objectively measurable time. The drowning man is said to have a visual playback of his life projected into his consciousness, and dreamers are supposed to accomplish the entire dream in the brief period between "waking" and "sleeping." In both these cases we have railway sidings of para-consciousness which, when they return to the main line, exhibit a time metric that is incommensurable with that of "objective time." But I doubt that in either case the paraphenomena could be temporally ordered except through re curring periodicities, at the very least those involved in the more or less self-conscious sorting of data. The further we get from the external natural world, the more difficult it is to seize upon the regularities which give rise to the sense of time. In the external world, however, the situation is quite clear-cut. The motion of the clock's hands, the audible click and beat of the chronometer, the regular procession of the particles of sand through a small aperture, these things are all devices whereby we isolate from the great flow of experience those regularities in which the future is like the past. Clocks are not always so explicit, nor are they always devices. The diurnal cycle, that of the seasons, the phases of the moon, are all ancient and honorable clocks, and they wouldn't have functioned as clocks if the future had not been like the past. Where aspects of the future, as it matures into the present, are not like the past, the items involved are not usable to indicate temporal passage in any clear way. Beans sprout in any time between two days and two weeks. Here the future will only be very roughly like the past. Crickets, on the other hand, chirp so regularly that their periods can be used as temperature indicators. Fortunately we do not have to go further than the external world of natural fact to compass the usual remarks about the resemblance of the future to the past. We need no fantastic breakfaster drawn into the reclusi?n of his own mind to save his sense of time. Hume's followers are victims of Newton's con ception of absolute time. To be sure, whenever Hume deals with time as time, he steadfastly denies that it is "possible for time alone ever to make its appearance, or be taken notice of by the</page><page sequence="11">24 NATHANIEL LAWRENCE mind." 6 He further insists that "time cannot make its appearance to the mind, either alone, or attended with a steady unchangeable object, but is always discover'd by some perceivable succession of changeable objects."7 When Hume deals with time in terms of the "future," however, he seems to be thinking of an onrushing empty medium, capable of being filled with any orderly or dis orderly collection of objects and occurrences. This metaphysical monstrosity lost its usefulness, even to physical science, around the turn of the present century. (Actually, as Hume himself affirms, no such empty medium is to be encountered.) More over, the awareness of time is not a mere awareness of a succession of changeable objects. A certain regularity in the change is fundamental to the awareness of time. This dependence of ab stract time upon concrete regularity is increasingly more apparent as we demand greater and greater precision in temporal measure ment. The perfect clock is invariant under all conceivable con ditions. Its future and past are, theoretically, in perfect con formity. To try to summarize these remarks with directness, if some one asks, "Will the future be like the past?" the answer is, I think, "If it's the future, it will be." (1) Plainly perfect conformity of phenomenal future to phenomenal past is not what is asked for. At the one extreme of perfect conformity, we have a similarity of future to past which no one expects, and which no experience lures us into expecting. (2) At the other extreme, complete dissimilarity in every respect is really possible only in pen-and paper philosophy, for, if it be taken seriously it undermines the conception of consciousness itself in a reductio ad absurdum to end all absurdities. (3) Presumably, however, no one is con cerned with such extremities, but rather with observed temporal sequence. (4) What is neglected is that "future" means "future time"; that our conception of time arises from the awareness of order, and that this order is not mere succession but successions of similarities, as our refined conceptions of abstract time indicate. (5) Devised clocks demonstrate clearly the conformities essential 8 Treatise, Bk. I, Pt. II, Sec. Ill, par. 7. 7 Ibid.</page><page sequence="12">CAUSALITY, WILL AND TIME 25 to the conception of time. Natural clocks do so less obviously and the mechanisms of psychological clocks are much more obscure. We rarely have to depend upon the latter alone. (6) The crucial point is that nowhere does time appear merely as an abstraction from succession. Only in Wonderland do we get the Cheshire grin without the Cheshire cat. Only in the pages of the philos ophers do we get time without the similar sequences from which it is abstracted. In real life, in the experience to which empiricism so proudly points, this fantastic "time" is not to be found. It is the similarities, the conformities in succession, from which we derive the abstract consideration of time, and indeed which serve as the backdrop against which other less orderly sequences can be given temporal specification. (7) The conception of future time requires the conception of a continuity of at least some sets of events which conform to past events. To ask if the future will be like the past is to neglect the empirical origins of our concep tion of time and the conformai character of those origins which give rise to our conception of time. Ill Although the problem of the conformity of the future to the past is often associated with the topic of cause and effect, there is no necessity of its so being. Even if the- above arguments were completely coercive, and the proposition that at least some of the future must conform to the past were finally established, it would not at all follow that there had been natural causes in the past, that they were necessary, or that they would be present or necessary in the future. If one could be assured of necessary causes in nature, then indeed the future would be like the past, but the converse conditional, of course, does not hold. On the other hand it seems unlikely that any genuinely empirical treatment of the idea of cause can either ignore the topic of the causality of the will, or reduce it to an opaque form of natural mechanical causality. The so-called "empirical" conception of causation is marked by a peculiar irony: the idea of the will as cause, upon which</page><page sequence="13">26 NATHANIEL LAWRENCE this conception is at least partly dependent, it has either ignored or distorted. The reliable conformity of the future to the past, a topic which is capable of relatively distinct treatment, it has made a central consideration. Yale University.</page></plain_text>
