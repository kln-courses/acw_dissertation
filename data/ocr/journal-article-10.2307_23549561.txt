<plain_text><page sequence="1">Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion 4/1-4/2 (1992) ON THE TRANSFORMATION OF 'BELIEF' AND THE DOMESTICATION OF 'FAITH' IN THE ACADEMIC STUDY OF RELIGION DONALD WIEBE I More than a decade ago, Professor Smith and I were involved in what we both thought was a significant difference of opinion about the nature of the academic study of religion. In a paper on "the role of belief in the study of religion" I tried to show how important the concept of belief is to that enterprise, despite the increasing recognition by scholars in the field that religion is a great deal more than simply a catalogue of doctrines and beliefs held consciously in mind by the devotee. Given my decision to present my views on this matter to the Canadian Society for the Study of Religion,' it seemed appropriate to contrast my position primarily with that of Professor Smith, whose views had been widely disseminated in his The Meaning and End of Religion and had been elaborated in his then recently published Belief and History? Not satisfied with the very limited discussion available to the thesis in that setting, I sought further response by having the paper published. It appeared in Numen under the title of "The Role of Belief in the Study of ' This look place al the Learned Society meetings held in London, Ontario, in 1978. 2 Wilfred Cantwell Smith Meaning and End of Religion: A New Approach to the Religious Traditions of Mankind.

I was not convinced by Professor Smith's arguments in that "Reply" and I scribbled out the structure of a response. I did not, however, continue the public discussion of our difference of views at that time. I had expected, or at least hoped, that others might enter the debate and in extending the discussion make possible greater clarification of the issues involved. That expectation however went unfulfilled for the most part, there being, to my knowledge, but one essay published on the theme by Colin Grant under the title "Smith's Discovery and the Ethics of Belief."5 But Grant's concern, unfortunately for me, was less with the theoretical differences between Smith and me than with practical questions concerning the relationship between Professor Smith's discovery about the role of belief in religion to the "ethics of belief'—where the latter notion is understood by Grant not in terms of the question of the structure of believing but rather with the consequences that the holding of particular beliefs might have more generally in society. Put more succinctly, where my concern was with what might be termed the internal morality of belief or the epistemic justification of belief, Grant concerned himself with the moral effects of religious believing and beliefs. Grant's paper, moreover, seems to me to have misconstrued the most significant aspect of Professor Smith's 'discovery' with respect to the relation of belief to religion and therefore failed, to some extent, to understand the thrust of my critique of Smith. According to Grant, Smith's 'discovery' concerns simply "the radical nature of the change in meaning of belief'6 even though such transformations of the meanings of words in the growth and development of all languages is common fare. Although Professor Smith does at one ' Donald Wicbc, "The Role of Belief in the Study of Religion: A Response to Wilfred Cantwell Smith," Numen 26 (1979): 234-249. 4 Wilfred Cantwell Smith, "Belief: A Reply to a Response," Numen 27 (1980): 247 255. 5 Colin Grant, "Smith's Discovery and the Ethics of Belief," Studies in Religion 13 (1984): 461-477.

My concern, on the other hand, was and is simply a logical and epistemological one regarding the implications Smith's 'discovery' holds for our understanding of the natures of 'faith' and 'belief and their relation to each other. Grant's essay tempted me to re-enter the debate with Professor Smith but work on other projects made that impossible at the time. This conference, however, seems a suitable occasion on which to raise again the question of the role of belief in the academic study of religion, the resolution of which I think could make an important contribution to determining how the academic study of religion ought to proceed. Furthermore, this occasion provides me an opportunity to try to correct any misunderstandings or distortions of Professor Smith's position that I may inadvertently have introduced into the discussion of his work. II 1 direct my attention first then, to the matter of my exegesis and interpretation of Professor Smith's work. It is not that I wish now to prove to Professor Smith, or to anyone else, that he actually said what I claimed he said but rather to be as fair as I can in coming to a determination not only as to the meaning of his explicit claims but as to what I think those claims entail. In that regard however, I should like to acknowledge here that there may well have been some ground for Professor Smith's disappointment with my treatment of his arguments regarding belief. Certainly the brevity of my analysis of his nuanced argument, which had seen considerable refinement in various publications, hardly permitted doing full justice to the exposition of all facets of Smith's position regarding faith, belief, and the academic study of religion. Smith's careful style of argumentation, which involves piling qualification upon qualification provides fertile soil for misreading him, as he seems himself to admit in giving consideration in his "Reply" to the possibility of berating not only me but also himself "for having set forth that thesis without, apparently, making it at all clear."7 Despite the note of irony in this comment, it did appear to me then as it does now, that Professor Smith so qualified his initial claims regarding belief and faith 7 Smith, op cit., 1980; 247.</page><page sequence="4">50 Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion 4/1-4/2 (1992) that he often ended up espousing not only those initial claims but also their contradictories, thus accounting for his shock at my surprise at his admission that there was not only an ideational component to faith but also that precisely that ideational element was of considerable importance to the student of religion. Furthermore, my concern to treat the views of other scholars as well as those of Professor Smith, combined with limitations on the length of articles usually permitted by journal editors, made a rather 'blunt' treatment of Professor Smith's position a necessity. Despite the essay's shortcomings however, for which I apologise, such a 'blunt' treatment may not be entirely without merit, for it may allow, I think, for the achievement of a degree of focus and specificity that will permit us to put Professor Smith's claims to some kind of test. There is a further contributing factor, 1 think, to Professor Smith's profound sense of my having misread and even distorted his argument which it seems to me requires some comment here for I do not wish to back away from it. It appears that my attempt to unwind the intricate intertwining of theological, moral, and methodological concerns in his argument is considered by Professor Smith to constitute a distortion of it whereas I see it as a necessary task to that of assessing its cogency. Whether separating those elements as aspects of Professor Smith's position constitutes proper analysis or a misrepresentation of his argument is itself a philosophical question about the nature of philosophical analysis and not a simple matter of description. I shall not here, however, take up that debate but will, rather, suggest that my argument then, as well as now, be recognized for what it is, namely, a critique of his views from within a widely accepted Cartesian analytical framework of thought. Having acknowledged the difficulties that make interpreting Professor Smith's work somewhat hazardous, it still seems to me, upon re examination of our dispute, that my description of his position was, and is, essentially fair and on the mark. At the very least, as Professor Smith himself noted in his "Reply," I properly understood the implications of his position, although he also insisted that I made improper use of that knowledge. The truth of that latter claim, in my opinion, is a matter of dispute but not one to pursue if the goal is to come to some determination regarding the value of belief to the academic study of religion. And it is primarily that issue to which I wish to give attention here. Ill My central concern in the disputed essay was the claim that the concept of belief is not merely useless in the task of interpreting and</page><page sequence="5">'Belief and'Faith' 51 explaining the meaning of religion but rather positively misleading. I argued that such a claim is radical and counter-intuitive and, in order to be successful, would have to be extraordinarily well argued. I made reference to the case against 'belief in the work of several authors but paid particular attention to its formulation in the work of Professor Smith in an attempt to show that such a well argued case had not, in fact, been made. It is obvious that I did not persuade Professor Smith of that 'fact' ten years ago, but it seems to me that it is worth another try and that in taking up this task again I am accepting his invitation to join him and his colleagues, as he put it in his "Reply," in the "demanding task of rethinking our basic interpretive categories."8 The foundation of Professor Smith's argument against 'belief,' which he considers to be of fundamental significance for any methodological proposal regarding the nature of the study of religion, flows from what he calls his "major empirical discovery."9 This discovery, as I have already intimated in my remarks on Grant above, is more than a simple discovery of the change of meaning in the use of the word 'belief.' To put it in a nutshell, his discovery is that in the traditions he has examined religious persons did not ask anyone to believe anything; that is, that believing, in the modern sense of the term, was not a central religious category. From an awareness of the change of the meaning of the word belief then, claims Smith, it can be seen that, until recent times, no one affirmed that it was religiously important to hold certain beliefs (i.e., doctrines, dogmas). If this is true, Smith continued, it requires of the student of religion to adopt a new way of looking at religious life; it requires an approach that does not involve the use of the concept belief. Since 'belief is of little or no value to the faith of the devotee it follows that a study of religion that takes 'belief seriously—that is, as of central significance to religion—and therefore focuses attention upon beliefs and belief-systems rather than upon the 'religious life' of the devotee is utterly misguided. And from this it would seem to follow that the new way of looking at the religious life would require eschewing the use of any and all concepts foreign to the discourse of the religious community because the concepts that are central to the scientific search for explanations and theories seem necessarily to stand at odds with the role of the central concepts in religious discourse. Ibid.. 248.</page><page sequence="6">52 Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion 4/1-4/2 (1992) Without rejecting entirely Professor Smith's claim to the discovery regarding 'belief I nevertheless find myself with a twofold disagreement with the position he attempts to build upon it. In the first instance, it is obvious that there are religious devotees, even if in only comparatively recent times, for whom belief is central and belief-systems of utmost importance. Many such devotees in fact refer to themselves as 'religious believers,' as do modern Christian fundamentalists, and appear therefore to consider 'belief a religious category. That belief was not an element in that sense in earlier religious traditions simply does not stand as an argument against the claim that there are religious traditions in which it plays a central role, unless, of course, Professor Smith holds an essentialist view of the nature of religion. Consequently, to see these belief traditions as distortions of earlier forms of belief-free commitment and therefore as heresy, as does Smith, is itself a failure to achieve the empathetic understanding of 'the other' that historians of religion expect of all students in the field—including philosophers. My second disagreement with Professor Smith is more fundamental; it holds, moreover, even if one accepts his discovery to be not merely empirical but a philosophical discovery about the essential nature of all religions. From the fact that belief is not a religious category it does not follow that the concept ought not to be used in the study and interpretation of religion. That would only follow, it seems to me, if it is assumed that all concepts used in the study of religion must be religious concepts. Professor Smith is no doubt right that it is a mistranslation on the part of the student to make it appear as if the religious devotees "themselves thought believing important""1 but there is no reason to think that use of the category of belief necessarily implies that they did consider it religiously important. Even if believing in the modern sense is not a religious act or injunction, it is still nevertheless something religious people do. And it is wholly appropriate, therefore, for students of religion to take account of this fact; and they cannot do that if the use of the concept of belief is prohibited. And what applies here to the use of the modern concept of belief applies also to the use of other scientific categories that the student of religion may employ. Consequently, if the traditional and modern concepts of belief diverge as significantly as Professor Smith contended, it would follow that the understandings of religion held by the devotee and by the scientific student of religion would be fundamentally at odds for one would have 1 Ibid.</page><page sequence="7">'Belief and 'Faith' 53 come to that understanding from the inside out, so to speak, on the basis of 'belief' in the traditional sense of the term and the other from the outside in on the basis of the use the modern notion of belief. And, if that were so, it was obvious that Professor Smith's objection to the modern concept of belief was merely symbolic of his rejection of any social-scientific approach to understanding human life. And that position it seemed to me at the time, as it does now, is indefensible. Ernest Gellner's work in Cause and Meaning in the Social Sciences makes clear why that is so and I shall briefly delineate the substance of his argument in that regard here." Gellner develops his critique of such an understanding of the nature of the social sciences with special regard to the work of modern philosophers like Peter Winch and Alasdair Maclntyre. Winch and Maclntyre, like Smith, are centrally concerned with preserving a humane or humanist approach to the study of human culture and society that would, as Gellner puts it, retain the human image of persons by refusing analyses of them that would deprive them of their freedom and dignity. A scientific sociology that explains human phenomena by subsuming them under general laws and theories, however, as Gellner points out, might explain men and societies not in terms of their own concepts and beliefs, but in terms of other concepts imposed by the sociologist from outside. The 'internal concepts' might be shown to be irrelevant or illusory [and) the thinkers under consideration are anxious above all to deny this possibility. On the whole they accept that anthropomorphism is out in natural science (though not all of them, and not unambiguously), but they wish to save the anthropomorphic imane of man himself." But fulfilling that 'soteriological' function of saving this form of anthropomorphism for the social sciences, Gellner shows, involves espousing what he calls "the collective privileged access theory"13 of culture which insists that explanations of human behaviours and institutions cannot be had in terms of recurring patterns of physical movement and the like but only in terms of the meanings they have for the participants in the community. Thus, explanations of human " Emesl Gellncr, Cause and Meaning in the Social Sciences (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1973). I will be drawing on the Following two essays reprinted in that volume: "The New Idealism: Cause and Meaning in the Social Sciences," (pp. 50-77), and "The Entry of the Philosophers," (pp. 78-87). " Ibid., 80. " Ibid., 51.</page><page sequence="8">54 Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion 4/1-4/2 (1992) behaviour, from this perspective, must proceed from the outside in. And this he insists is to espouse a form of idealist metaphysics with all its attendant problems, for it implies that any and all meaningful action is exempt from nature and therefore from causal analysis. He writes: If Ihe meanings make (he acts into what they are it seems to follow that any 'external' method which ignores or denies those meanings and replaces them by a new set of its own, must be mistaken. The comparative or generalizing method, which in the interest of achieving generalizations empties the conduct it deals with of its locally idiosyncratic content, its 'meaning', must be in error. A fortiori, behaviourism or causal explanation is out. Either social life is exempt from causation (Winch), or social causation is of a special kind without generality and internal to the ideas of the participants (Maclntyre)." Although there is no denying the possibility that what the new idealist sees as a meaningful account of human behaviour may in fact be true, there is, Gellner points out, no way of guaranteeing a priori that such accounts will always be true or be the only ones to apply. The institutions of a society are indeed 'made' by the concepts used by participants but this does not in itself demonstrate that the assumptions or theories built into the concepts are true. And if they are not, then explanations of the institutions will only be achieved by refusing to be satisfied with merely 'internal accounts.' But the possibility of this kind of move away from such charitableness of interpretation is precisely what Professor Smith, it seems to me, wishes to block. Like Winch and Maclntyre, it seems that Professor Smith is convinced that it is only in this kind of conceptual framework that the moral life of human communities can be salvaged and protected because where there is no freedom there is no morality. According to Gellner, the 'charitable' interpretations of culture that such anthropomorphic positions allow, involves the social scientist in a multiplicity of difficulties chief of which is a relativism that requires the incoherence of a universal endorsement of all cultures." And that incoherence is found on at least two levels; the moral and the cognitive. There is the suggestion in such anthropomorphic traditions that to explain a culture in terms of concepts foreign to it is always to undermine its moral value because it does not take seriously the moral values of the culture under examination and attempts to account for cultural value in 1 Ibid., 81. 15 Ibid., 83.</page><page sequence="9">'Belief and 'Faith' 55 a causal fashion. It is not obvious to me, however, why an explanation of a cultural phenomenon must necessarily be immoral simply because it does not accept the meaning the phenomenon has for members of that culture. The point at issue here is clearly put, I think, in Marvin Harris's response to such an anthropomorphic interpretation of the meaning of human sacrifice amongst the Aztecs provided by Marshall Sahlins. Harris writes: No one can doubt that 'culture is meaningful in its own right,' but any will doubt Sahlins's authorization for telling us what it meant to be dragged up the pyramid by the hair—even if it was 'magical hair,' as he proposes in a footnote—to be bent back spread-eagled and cut open. Sahlins claims it mattered to the victims whose screams ended five hundred years ago that they were part of a sacrament and not just part of a meal. 'It is positivist cant,' writes Sahlins, to impose western categories such as cannibalism on these high holy rites. It wasn't cannibalism, he continues, it was the 'highest form of communion'—as if communion is not also a western concept and as if labelling human sacrifice 'communion' transubstantiates obsidian knives and human meat into things we can't recognize as being sharp and nutritious respectively. We should certainly try to understand why people think they behave the way they do, but we cannot stop at that understanding. It is imperative that we reserve the right not to believe ruling-class explanations. A ruling class that says it is eating some people out of concern for the welfare of all is not telling the whole story. An anthropology that can do no more than make that viewpoint seem plausible serves neither science nor morality. Aztec cannibalism was the highest form of communion for the eaters but not for the eaten. For the eaten, it was not only cannibalism but the highest form of exploitation. (Even the bourgeoisie refrains from dining on its workers.) If it be positivist cant to describe human relationships in such terms, long live positivism. If it be anthropology to struggle against the mystification of the causes of inequality and exploitation, long live anthropology." As for the cognitive incoherence of such a principle of charity in the interpretation of culture, Gellner argues that it is intuitively repellant to find 'acceptable' the primitive witchcraft and sorcery of archaic cultures in the same sense one finds modern physics acceptable. And in this I am in full agreement with him. In terms of the discussion above, to do so is to contravene the internal morality of scientific knowing. As Gellner also points out, to do this is a pragmatic contradiction because this can only be a belief held in one's study and not in one's life. Furthermore such charitable interpretations fail adequately to account for the complex reality of the social world which presents societies with internal cognitive " Marvin Harris, Cultural Materialism: The Struggle far a Science of Culture (New York: Random House, 1979), 340.</page><page sequence="10">56 Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion 4/1-4/2 (1992) conflicts and inter-cultural disagreements in the mutual relations between societies, for in theory such a transcending of one's cultural barriers ought not to be possible. In light of these difficulties with the "collective privileged access theory" of culture, Gellner rejects the advice of philosophers like Winch and Maclntyre not because, as he puts it, they entered into the discussion of the nature of the social sciences as immodest missionaries bent on "bringing methodological salvation" without even bothering "to learn the basic mores of the land," but because, even though interesting, they are wrong.17 In conclusion he writes: It is not obvious . . . that 'the study of man can hardly avoid being anthropomorphic.' The fact that, tautologically, the subject matter of the 'study of man' is indeed man does not seem ... to entail that the explanatory concepts invoked must also be, in some sense further to be defined, human. The position of, let us say, behaviourists, to the effect that certain very human concepts ('consciousness') must be excluded, whether true or false, does not seem . . . self evidently absurd. There is one straightforward sense in which the study of man can be 'nonhuman' in form: if it consists of causal explanations of human behaviour, in which the antecedents are events outside the range of ordinary human experience, and only accessible to the scientist with special equipment (for instance, microscopes).1* IV This conclusion is likely to appear not only paradoxical but also self contradictory to humanist scholars like Professor Smith. And it is for this reason that I took Professor Smith's objections to the modern notion of belief to amount to an objection to this set of implications which seem to flow from it. It appears, however, that I may have been wrong to have done so for Professor Smith insists in his "Reply" that he was not and is not interested in dissuading scholars from using the modern concept of belief in their analyses of religion. Drawing that conclusion, however, may be a bit hasty because Smith's advice comes with a very important qualification that makes this disclaimer a little more ambiguous than it at first appears to be. His concern, that is, is to dissuade scholars, as he puts it, from "using the notion [of belief] unself-critically and/or ambiguously, and from making it central in religious interpretation, especially from imagining it anachronistically central as a concept for 11 Gellner, 80. 18 Ibid., 73.</page><page sequence="11">'Belief and 'Faith' 57 religious persons' self-interpretation."19 In fact, Professor Smith insists that he has always acknowledged that belief is an element in religion, claiming that "in the situation presented in the Bible [for example], the writers and protagonists either believed what they believed unself critically, as unconscious presupposition, or else they thought that they knew."2" What such devotees 'thought that they knew,' however, they surely preached and desired others to 'believe.' And any student of religion, consequently, will need to invoke the concept of belief in order to make sense of this kind of situation. In admitting this it seems to me therefore that there is considerable agreement between Smith and me on the role of 'belief in the study of religion after all, but just exactly what all this means with respect to Professor Smith's critique of the notion of belief is not altogether clear. There is, quite obviously, a drastic difference in epistemological assumptions between us. Professor Smith finds no difficulty in drawing radical distinctions between believing, on the one hand, and knowing, recognizing, perceiving, and discerning, on the other, whereas I do, and that has made understanding each other's positions very difficult. In any even, I am not satisfied that Professor Smith's comments here salvage the case he has earlier made against a role for 'belief in the study of religion. Resolving such epistemological matters, however, cannot be taken up here and I must, therefore, limit myself to a few comments on this revised view of the role of belief in the academic study of religion presented in Smith's "Reply." Firstly, it should be noted that I am in full agreement with Professor Smith that an ambiguous and/or uncritical use of the concept of belief, as with any other concept, is dangerous. Secondly, I am persuaded by Professor Smith's argument to the effect that the concept of belief in the modern sense was, for the most part, not central to the religious person's self-interpretation. I do not, however, think this necessarily true for all believers in the past although proving this point is more than can be undertaken at the moment. More importantly, as I have already indicated in the discussion to this point, there are many religious persons today for whom this does not hold true. This is something Professor Smith finds impossible to accept, or so it seems, since he appears to consider people who now define themselves with reference to such belief-systems as being guilty of some great heresy.21 Even should Professor Smith be entirely " Smith, op cit., 1980; 254. Ibid., 252. 31 Smith, op cit., 1977; v.</page><page sequence="12">58 Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion 4/1-4/2 (1992) right in his claim that 'belief does not characterize the religious consciousness of archaic believers there is no necessity that 'change' in this regard must be read as degeneration (i.e., heresy) rather than as 'development,' unless, of course, one assumes a particular ontology in which the essence of religion precludes such development a priori. But in light of the revised claim that 'belief' is not entirely inappropriate as a category for interpreting religious traditions that assumption becomes untenable. My final comment upon Professor Smith's claim relates to his warning against making the concept of belief "central in religious interpretation." Unfortunately this warning is ambiguous: if this is meant simply to reinforce either of the two points noted above and nothing more, there is no problem. But, if Professor Smith means here, as I think he does, that the scholar cannot use 'belief as a central concept in his or her interpretation of religion because it is not so used by the religious devotee, then, as I have already made clear, I disagree fundamentally. As I indicated clearly in the article to which Professor Smith took objection, the outsider student of religion has done just that and it is precisely that use of 'belief that I had set out to defend. And it has been my contention that Professor Smith's arguments throughout the writings referred to above amounted to an attack on such a use of the concept of belief. That is, the overwhelming impression in these works is that 'belief is of no, or such little, value to the religious devotee that a study of religion that takes it seriously and focuses attention on 'belief-systems' is utterly, or at least essentially, misguided. As Professor Smith has put it in Belief and History, faith is from God but one's beliefs come from one's century.22 If my interpretation of these texts is wrong, as one reading of Professor Smith's "Reply" might suggest, then I am in error in what I have attributed to him. However, if that is the case, it seems to me to follow that the understanding of the nature of religious studies I had originally set out to defend should find vindication in Professor Smith's restatement (?) of his position in his "Reply." If it is true, that is, that I have misinterpreted Professor Smith and if it is true that he in fact recognizes the importance of 'belief in religion in the sense I do, then it would seem to follow that he would be willing to accept the possibility of an explanation of religion, as I have already put it, from the outside in. Indeed, as I shall proceed to show, he would then have to acknowledge that the academic study of religion is essentially a study of</page><page sequence="13">'Belief' and 'Faith' 59 tradition; as stated in my original formulation of the issue, he would have to acknowledge that to understand the tradition would be, in effect, to understand, as best as we can—as scientific students of religion—the faith of those in the tradition. But this, in my opinion, though not only my opinion, is precisely what he has rejected as utterly destructive to religion, and that he would still today consider destructive to religion. As Grant has aptly put it, according to Smith this kind of approach to the study of religion reduces faith to the dimensions of the modern (i.e., the transformed) concept of belief and thereby constitutes an unacceptable "domestication" of faith." In so historicizing the basic allegiances of religious devotees by making of faith nothing more than the subjective element of trust shown by the devotees in the reality to which the devotee believes him or herself to be related, the power and vibrancy of God (or the gods) in the lives of those devotees is replaced with abstract and inert epistemic claims of particular historical communities. Therefore, despite the suggestions I see in Smith's "Reply" that we are in agreement in our views about the role of 'belief in the study of religion, or at least that there exists an overlap in our views in that regard, I do not really think the differences between us to have been bridged. Nor do I believe that I have simply misconstrued the nature of his argument. A very clear indication of that disagreement is the difference in our views on the nature of the truth for which the academic student of religion seeks. Professor Smith would maintain that the framework within which I wish to speak of the role of belief in the study of religion operates with far too narrow a concept of truth. According to Smith, that is, the use of the concept of belief in my proposal involves a notion of truth that is essentially impersonal because it concerns itself only with the question of the truth or falsity of propositional claims. And such a positivistic notion of truth, he would insist, fails to recognize that truth is considerably more than that—that truth inheres in persons and not simply in propositions. Given this affinity between the modern concept of belief and the propositional view of truth, and Smith's thorough rejection of the latter, which has been tagged by some as 'personalism,' it would appear that my original interpretation of Professor Smith's position regarding 'belief and my interpretation of his warning against the illegitimate use of the concept in the study of religion was not wholly wide of the mark. That 'personalism' would imply, moreover, that understanding a community of persons is unlikely to be successful if it is done in terms 21 Grant, op cit., 472.</page><page sequence="14">60 Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion 4/1-4/2 (1992) of concepts tied to such a narrow and impersonal view of truth which is foreign to the understanding of truth by which that community lives. Such an understanding, consequently, could not help but be reductionistic. That could only be avoided if the understanding sought were not a conceptual, analytical, and theoretical activity but rather a moral one. And on this score it seems to me, therefore, that Professor Smith could happily echo the claim C. S. Lewis puts into the mouth of Hingest the chemist in That Hideous Strength: "There are no sciences like Sociology. ... I happen to believe that you can't study men; you can only get to know them, which is quite a different thing."24 A brief review of the difference in our assessments of the methodological value of such a personalism to the student of religion will help, I think, to make clear not only why I rejected Professor Smith's proposals but also why he saw that rejection as being based on a distorted view of his proposals. According to Professor Smith, my understanding of his 'personalism' was as wide of the mark as was my understanding of his position regarding 'belief.' An essential ingredient in that misunderstanding, he insists, was my attributing to him two concepts—the notions of "esoteric religion" and "real religion"—both of which, he claims, are foreign to his thought. It is true, as he points out, that he did not use the word "esoteric," but then neither did I say he had. But little of consequence hangs on that point for it is obvious that a particular concept can be in use even where the word that normally designates it is not. Nevertheless I did attribute to him the notion of "esoteric religion" despite his not using the term and insist even now that it was not inappropriate to do so. The point of my argument then, which remains unchanged, was simply this: Professor Smith's understanding of "religion" and "religious truth" as personal excludes understanding it to all but the religious devotee; only those who have encountered what Smith calls the Transcendent, that is, can truly understand the nature of what the student of religion refers to as religion. His position on this is clearly and boldly stated in his The Meaning and End of Religion: "(T]he whole path and substance of religious life," he writes there, "lies in its relation to what cannot be observed."25 And this implies, of course, that "the student's first responsibility is to recognize that there is always and in principle more in any man's faith than any other man can see."26 Consequently, "a 14 Cited by R.

It is puzzling therefore that Professor Smith objects to my use of the word esoteric to describe his position for it seems quite appropriate in describing the private and privileged 'information' of the devotee compared to that of the outsider student of religion. Indeed, the information is very much limited to the insider, and is therefore secret, as is clear from Professor Smith's insistence in his The Faith of Other Men that a basic principle in the academic study of religion "is an ability to see the divine which, [as he puts it], I call faith."28 If religion is only truly open to the understanding of the devotee the phenomenon of religion disappears in favour of discourse about the Transcendent of which the devotee has subjective experience which makes of it something esoteric in comparison to that which Professor Smith refers to as tradition. In this regard Professor Smith maintains that I have misunderstood his argument about the nature of "recognition," i.e., that because I do not think historically I am unclear as to what he means by claiming that the devotee does not believe in God but rather 'recognizes God.' I cannot agree with him, however, for Professor Smith's point here can only be made, I think, if the notion of recognition has overtones of meaning that border on the mystical. I have no disagreement with Professor Smith on the matter of the religious person's assumption, or claim, of having recognized or perceived a transcendent reality. My point in the debate here is a logical one and not historical. It is simply this, that a claim to recognition or awareness of any reality, transcendent or otherwise, is not necessarily recognition or awareness of, or experience of such an ontological 'reality'; misperception, illusion, delusion and so on are all possible accounts or explanations of the experience and that fact cannot " Ibid., 171. !* Wilfred Cnntwell Smith, The Failli of Other Men (New York: Harper and Row, 1963), 46.</page><page sequence="16">62 Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion 4/1-4/2 (1992) simply be dismissed. And to claim that the devotee need not be concerned with such logical matters suggests to me, therefore, that the devotee has a special source of knowledge and so has the alleged privileged access that makes his or her experience esoteric. It is in regard to this matter of the logical relation of belief to faith that I made brief reference to Professor Hick's work on the problem of religious knowledge. I suggested that Hick's analysis of the nature of religious knowledge provides a clear indication of the necessary relation between faith and belief and that such philosophical issues as he concerns himself with could not be taken up if the modern notion of belief had never emerged. Since Professor Smith maintains that I also misread Professor Hick, a brief restatement of the central thrust of his Hick's argument may be of some help here. It is true that Hick's notion of faith has much in common with that of Professor Smith, but unlike Smith, Hick thinks it not only possible but important for the devotee to concern him or herself with the noetic status of faith—i.e., with the propositional beliefs which the faith presupposes or to which the experience of faith gives rise. The entire purpose of Hick's Faith and Knowledge, in fact, is with faith as a putative mode of knowledge and the desire to know "in what it consists and how it is related to knowing and believing in general."29 Furthermore, Hick explicitly rejects the notion that faith is of such a character that it cannot be compared with, as he puts it, "other hearings and seeings and knowings and believings."3" And in this connection Professor Smith's 'empirical discovery' that "no significant classical religious thinker ever said that it [belief] is a necessary condition of faith" is entirely irrelevant (or even wrong if the implication of their silence on the matter is taken to mean that they would have said the contrary).31 This only proves that such classical religious thinkers did not consciously attend to the question of the logical connection between faith and belief (knowledge) that I had attempted to elucidate and in support of which I had made reference to Hick's theory of religious knowledge. It is nevertheless precisely on this point that Professor Smith considered the "pitiful misunderstandings" to have proliferated.32 He agrees "that religious persons and communities have indeed operated intellectually at various points in history with various ideas and sets of John Hick, Faith and Knowledge, (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1966), I. w Ibid., 5. " Smith, op cit., 1980; 250. " Ibid., 248.</page><page sequence="17">'Belief and 'Faith' 63 ideas."33 However, he claims that the significance of this is to be found in the fact that "unlike recent times no one affirmed that it was religiously important, historically speaking, to believe them."3'' If this is true, it is surely important, historically speaking, to establish this. But this truth or discovery, as I have just now intimated, has no logical significance here for whether or not the devotee considered believing to be a central and important element of the faith has no bearing upon whether or not believing is in fact, logically that is, so related to faith. Hick brings that clearly into focus when he points out the peculiar nature of the task taken up by the theologian or the philosopher of religion in their quest for understanding religion. As he puts it: [ijt is only when the religious believer comes to reflect upon his religion, in the capacity of philosopher or theologian, that he is obliged to concern himself with the noetic status of his faith. When he does so concern himself, it emerges that faith as trust (fiducia) presupposes faith tfides) as cognition of the object of that trust. For in order to worship God and commit ourselves to his providence we must first have faith (hat he exists. And it is this logically (though not temporally) prior sense of 'faith' that we are to investigate in the following chapters." A proper phenomenological account of, for example, early Christian faith must take cognizance of Professor Smith's discovery and not to do so would certainly result in a misunderstanding of religious history, but such phenomenological accounts are not the only matters that are of concern to the academic student of religion. My use of the phrase 'real religion' follows naturally on the heels of the idea of 'esoteric religion.' What the context of Professor Smith's argument makes plain, I suggest, is that his inordinate emphasis upon faith and religious experience devalues tradition to such an extent that reference to 'faith' as constituting what is really religious in contrast to the externals of the tradition is neither a misunderstanding nor a misrepresentation. It is rather a not unreasonable interpretation of his perception of tradition as merely providing clues, so to speak, as to what is the heart of the matter, namely the faith of the individual person within the tradition. That this interpretation implies that Professor Smith espouses an essentialist notion of religion is no a priori reason for rejecting the interpretation so much as it is a matter to be further explored.

" Hick, op cit., 4.</page><page sequence="18">64 Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion 4/1-4/2 (1992) That my interpretation of Professor Smith's position may be wrong I grant, but it should be noted that I am not alone in holding such a view about his position for then the question of misreading or misinterpretation can be helpfully put aside. In an early review of Professor Smith's personalist proposals regarding 'faith,' and 'tradition' C. J. Bleeker, after lengthy description of Smith's position argued the following: In his keen interest for people's religious life, Smith is in danger of underrating the significance of what he calls 'externals.' No clear distinction can be made between the externals of religion—symbols, institutions, doctrines, and practices—and pure religious life. In most cases you have to detect religion itself by interpreting the externals. This can only be done by impartial observation. It is therefore questionable whether the believer always understands his religion better than the outsider. It may be that the outsider, being a scholar, has a broader outlook and is in some respects better informed about the religion in question."1 And Eric Pyle, in his essay "In Defence of 'Religion"'37 a few years later argued that Professor Smith's claims regarding 'religion,' 'faith,' and 'tradition' amounts to a great deal more than a mere methodological recommendation. According to Pyle, we have here rather a covert argument on behalf of a very peculiar view of the nature of religion and religious experience that suggests the possibility that Professor Smith does in fact hold an essentialist notion of religion. Somewhat later, Gerald Larson came to a similar conclusion in his "Prolegomena to a Theory of Religion" in which he writes: Smith then argues that 'person within a tradition' or 'person' in relation to a 'tradition' is what Religious Studies should study, but the force of his argument is that Religion cannot be conceptually studied but only personally lived. Thus one is left with the peculiar position that one should study what cannot really be studied conceptually and, more than that, that there is nothing like Religion to study anyway. Whatever else Smith's position is it is something of a conversation stopper with respect to the issue of the conceptual clarification of Religion.1* What these critiques of Professor Smith's proposals indicate is that, despite the room that exists for misinterpretation of his work, he seems to have made it fairly clear that the modern notion of belief should not play a central role in the academic study of religion. It is obvious that it 1,1 C. J. Bleeker, "Future Task of History of Religions," Numen 7(1960): 232. " Eric Pyle, "In Defence of 'Religion,'" Religious Studies 3(1969): 347-353.

A further implication of such a view of religion, I argued, was that this precludes the possibility of an academic study of religion for it presumes that the understanding of the tradition is predicated on a prior knowledge or understanding of the faith of which the tradition is but an expression which understanding is indistinguishable from that of, so to speak, 'being in faith.' And this, it seems to me, is a requirement that the student of religion, borrowing an anthropological notion, 'go native.' In this regard the summary of Michael Pye's critique of Professor Smith may be usefully repeated here. [T]he study of religion is sufficiently painful to demand work against this trend...namely towards those critically refined abstractions which alone enable us to reflect comparatively, that is, upon more than one case at a time. This is also essential if anthropologists are to do more than simply disappear forever in the village of their choice; if historians of religion are to do more than relapse into antiquarianism; and if those who study religion (or something like it) in cultures other than those in which they grew up are to do more than become mere converts and enthusiasts. In other words, it is essential to make use of critically refined abstractions to bring particular sets of observed data into a wider area of intelligible discourse and reflection.™ There are many other points of disagreement between Professor Smith and me that I have not been able to pay attention to here. And it is entirely possible that I may have created a few more in this discussion although, obviously, I hope that is not the case. Furthermore, as to how to bring this discussion to a conclusion I am at somewhat of a loss. There can be no doubt but that Professor Smith and I share a great deal with respect to the question of the nature of the academic study of religions. Nevertheless, it is also obvious that there are some sharp divergences. I hope that the present discussion has helped to clarify the nature of the divergences; for in my opinion they exist not simply because of mutual misunderstanding but also because we work with radically ™ Michael Pye, "The Significance of the Japanese Intellectual Tradition for the History of Religions," in Peter Slater and Don Wiebe (eds.), Traditions in Contact and Change (Waterloo: Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1983), 568-569.</page><page sequence="20">66 Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion 4/1-4/2 (1992) different understandings (theories?) of the nature of the scientific enterprise. For Smith, from the time of his inaugural lecture in McGill University in 1949 to the present, science and religion are two developing traditions of thought which he thinks are capable of dynamic co-operation whereas I see them as divergent or incommensurable modes of thought. In that lecture he wrote: By accusation of irreverence modern man, particularly scientific man, is not deterred: he will scrutinize all that is before him, sacrosanct or no. But before the other half of this charge, he must, if honest, pause: that his scrutiny of holy things is vitiated by the inherent inappropriateness of the method to the material.40 Whereas I agree fully with Smith that the scientific student will not permit limits to be placed upon the scientific quest, I do not think he is right to claim that the honest scientist will find reason to pause regarding, as he puts it, the scientific scrutiny of holy things. The scientist would not, that is, talk of holy things but only of the cultural postulation of such realities. And the scientist would, moreover, consider it entirely appropriate to put to scrutiny claims about, and to analyze behaviour in relation to, such culturally postulated realities. The reason why Professor Smith thinks every honest scientist would find him or herself in agreement with this claim is to be found in his espousal of a classical notion of truth which is not to be found in the modern sciences. He admits, that is, that if science is to evolve "so as to create also a science of religion"41 it will have to recapture, as he puts it, a notion of truth that brings into relationship the intellectual and practical concern—a notion which was present, he says, in the early Greek phase of the development of science but which has since been discarded. By this he means that modern science must return from its present objectivist notion of truth to the understanding of the pursuit of truth as a moral and spiritual discipline.42 I have argued, however, that this recognition that modern science has in fact discarded the notion of truth to which Professor Smith is committed be taken seriously by also recognizing that modern science has only become what it is because it has discarded that classical notion of truth. But to take that recognition 411 Wilfred Cantwell Smith, "The Comparative Study of Religion: Reflections on the Possibility and Purpose of a Science of Religion," in McGill University Faculty of Divinity Inaunural Lectures (Montreal: McGill University, 1950), 41. 41 Ibid., 56.</page><page sequence="21">'Belief' and 'Faith' 67 seriously would also imply, then, that to ask that science give up that notion of objective truth would also be to ask it to give up its identity. And at this point the scientific or academic study of religion can no longer be distinguished from that which it studies. It is for this reason, then, that I have maintained that the differences between Professor Smith and me are genuine differences and not merely due to misunderstandings or simple mistakes of interpretation.
