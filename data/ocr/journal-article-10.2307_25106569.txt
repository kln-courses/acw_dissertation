<plain_text><page sequence="1">MEDIAEVAL REPRINTS. To those interested in the revival of saintly lore and the mys tical religion of the centuries stretching from the tenth to the fifteenth, the subject is at once so absorbing and so illuminating as to need nothing further than an indication of what reprints are procurable. Mathilda of Magdeburg, a nun of the thirteenth cen tury, has left a valuable and poetic document* consisting of three books : ? The Book of the Return Inward," " The Book of Vision," "The Book of Blessedness." The first is aphoristic and pro verbial in form; she opens with the main tenet of the mystic doctrine: "This is a book of love and in love shall it be com pleted; for nothing is so wise, or so holy, or so strong, or so beautiful, or so perfect as love." The second book of the King dom of Heaven, the nine choirs, the thrones of the apostles, the Virgin and Christ, and the rewards of preachers, martyrs and virgins, and the doctrine of unbaptized children has in it more of temporal error and less of divine truth, while Book III, in the form of dialogues between Love and the Soul, between the Soul and the senses, etc., despite its quaintnesses, holds much that is of great and lasting value. The mode of speech is at times to modern ears irreverently amorous and anthropomorphic, but none the less is there beneath its local and temporal form, indeed, a flowing light from the Divine. * " Das Fliessende Licht der Gottheit" By Mechthild von Magdeburg.

Warrack, which she had copied from the manuscript in the British Museum, from which he prepared his able summary of the conclusions of this most cheer ful and lovable anchoress. The absence of all unpleasant and irreverent intimacy with the heavenly hosts is one of the dis tinguishing and agreeable qualities in the Lady Juliana's book,* and most remarkable is it that without book knowledge or learn ing of any sort she was led by the contemplative life to the same conclusions reached by the most profound and philosophic of the mystics. She deals lucidly with a theory of dual personality and forebodes Pascal's "Hadst thou not had me, thou wouldst not seek me," when she says : " Our Lord said to me : I am the ground of thy beseeching; first it is my will that thou have it and then I make thee to wish for it and then I make thee to beseech it." Again the immortality of the soul presupposing its prenatal as well as postnatal existence, so insistent a point in modern poetry, was one of this untaught woman's conclusions; her vain search for a hell (although she carefully says " in all things I believe as the Holy Church believeth, preacheth and teacheth"), for God showed her none other than saved souls, her sense of the solidarity of the race, "for in this oneness standeth the life of all man kind," her robust and cheerful Christianity makes the document a valuable and delightfully readable addition to the literature of mystical philosophy. * " Revelations of Divine Love by Juliana, Anchoress at Norwich, 1373."
