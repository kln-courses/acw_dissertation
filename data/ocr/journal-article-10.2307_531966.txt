Lond. 54 (2), 199-213 (2000) 'WISE MEN NOWADAYS THINK OTHERWISE': JOHN RAY, NATURAL THEOLOGY AND THE MEANINGS OF ANTHROPOCENTRISM by JOHN HEDLEY BROOKE Harris Manchester College, Oxford OXI 3TD, UK SUMMARY The object of this paper is to re-examine the extent to which anthropocentric readings of nature were dislodged as a consequence of developments in 17th-century natural philosophy. The natural theology in Ray's Wisdom of God (1691) provides access to the issues because Ray was explicitly critical of those who imagined that everything had been made for man alone. The paper begins by identifying familiar features of the 'scientific revolution' that contributed most to a decentring of the human self: the Copernican innovation, telescopic discoveries, speculations concerning a plurality of worlds, the Cartesian ban on the investigation of final causes and the collapse of microcosm/macrocosm analogies. There were, however, counter currents to these centrifugal tendencies, notably in Robert Boyle's response to Descartes's strictures. In the main section of the paper, I therefore identify the various ways in which an anthropocentricity was not only preserved but re-emphasized in the post-Copernican Universe. A reconfiguration of human centrality was achieved through cosmology, epistemology and anthropomorphic conceptions of divine activity. As Ray's writing indicates, there were also common qualifications to the mechanization of nature. An elevation rather than relegation of the human spirit was also evident in claims to imitate the creative activities of the deity and in the aesthetic appreciation of the Creator's works. The presence in the world of so many resources for human use also fed anthropocentric sentiments. Boyle restored anthropocentric perspectives through an appeal to scripture and Ray through the suggestion that objects which might appear to have no human use now would have their uses revealed in the future. While Ray did indeed repudiate the proposition that everything was made for man alone, he remained convinced that everything had some human use. The paper concludes with a Darwinian perspective from which Ray's natural theology was incurably anthropocentric, even if it was not in every respect as arrogant as Darwin deemed natural theology to be. 199 © 2000 The Royal Society</page><page sequence="2">John Hedley Brooke INTRODUCTION: RAY'S UTILITY The discerning and pioneering naturalist John Ray (1627-1705) has been used for many purposes. In Peter Harrison's recent book, The Bible, Protestantism, and the rise of natural science, he illustrates the emergence of a new kind of science-a natural history in which God's creatures are stripped of their symbolic and emblematic meanings, to be studied and classified as objects having their own integrity.' Harrison's thesis is that the shift from symbolic meanings to taxonomic methods both reflected, and was facilitated by, a Protestant approach to scripture in which layers of symbolic and allegorical meanings had been replaced by a quest for a correct, single meaning of a text read literally. This new approach to the study of God's word had created the space for a new science of God's works. In Ray's Preface to The ornithology of Francis Willughby (1678) the purging of an older approach to nature was explicit: we have 'wholly omitted what we find in other Authors concerning Homonymous and Synonymous words, or the divers names of Birds, Hieroglyphics, Emblems, Morals, Fables, Presages or ought else appertaining to Divinity, Ethics, Grammar, or any sort of Humane Learning'.2 A new science of natural history, in which one studied the generation, food, behaviour and uses of animals, had its own autonomy. In a much older book, Charles Raven's biography, Ray was used to epitomize not a new type of science, but a new type of theology, in which the admiration of nature graduated into an appreciation of the Creator. Raven claimed that Ray's Wisdom of God (1691) was the 'first example' of a new physico-theology, capable of 'giving appropriate expression to the Christian faith in a scientific age'. For Raven, that was Ray's 'proper memorial'.3 At variance with both Protestant and Catholic traditions, Ray had transmitted a 'delight in the worth of the world'.4 By contrast, Neal Gillespie has given us a very different Ray, whose Wisdom of God was remarkable for its unoriginality.5 Ray's distinctiveness, according to Gillespie, lay in his tuning of physico-theology to the ear of the 'common reader'.6 In this account Ray was used to expose the social concerns that underpinned the affirmation of order and design in nature: the wish to reduce religious strife, the wish to protect natural history from accusations of atheism and materialism, and to promote a prudential Christianity against scoffers and sceptics. Ray has also been used by Paolo Rossi, among others, to show incipient tensions between science and theology. Such authors point to Ray's perplexity over fossil forms as the spectre of extinction arose.7 On the one hand, Ray would say that it was 'not without good reason' that divines and philosophers generally believed there had been no species lost (or added) since the first creation; on the other, if Raven represented him correctly, he was prepared to accept the extinction of species.8 Among these many uses of Ray, one of the most enthralling was by Sir Keith Thomas in his book Man and the natural world (1983). Here, Ray was used to epitomize a cultural shift away from anthropocentrism-from the view that all had been made for man. For Thomas this was a revolutionary shift and one that historians had largely ignored.9 To illustrate this dethronement of the human race, Ray was the perfect accomplice: 200</page><page sequence="3">John Ray, natural theology and the meanings of anthropocentrism It is a generally received opinion that all this visible world was created for Man [and] that Man is the end of creation, as if there were no other end of any creature but some way or other to be serviceable to man.... But though this be vulgarly received, yet wise men nowadays think otherwise.'° My aim in this paper is to examine some aspects of the shift to which Thomas drew attention and captured in Ray's affirmation that 'wise men nowadays think otherwise'. This requires a certain sharpening of focus on the meanings of anthropocentricity and the qualifications that Ray and others rehearsed. It is better to speak of qualification rather than refutation because in crucial respects anthropocentric assumptions were irrepressible. Expelled through the front door, they would return through the back. SOME CENTRIFUGAL FORCES If we ask how wise men had come to think otherwise, it is possible to point to a series of decentralizing forces which, during the 17th century, had compromised the Aristotelian dictum that all was subservient to man. Pride of place would normally be given to the Copernican innovation, which Sigmund Freud described as the first great blow to human dignity, dislodged as we were from the physical centre of God's creation. By the end of the 17th century, Thomas Burnet was referring to the Earth as an 'obscure and sordid particle'. Burnet's Earth, damaged by the great deluge, was a ruined world in more ways than one. It had become the 'discard and dregs of Nature' . To the implications of the Copernican innovation it would be important to add those empirical discoveries made possible by the telescope, which in Galileo's hands had disclosed a plethora of stars invisible to the naked eye. Of what earthly use were they? Ray's French contemporary Fontenelle wrote of our folly in believing that all of nature is intended for our use. With delightful satire he wrote that 'when our philosophers are asked the use of that prodigious number of fixed stars, a part of which would be sufficient to do that which all of them do, they respond coldly: they serve to enliven the view'.12 Many years later, in his novel Two on a tower, Thomas Hardy would draw the devastating conclusion that because those invisible stars were not made for us, nothing was. The affirmation of a plurality of worlds was in part a response to this problem. There might be rhyme and reason in the Universe after all, if invisible suns shone on other worlds.13 But in some versions of this speculative doctrine human significance was clearly diminished. An assumption of cosmic mediocrity becomes discernible. Perhaps, Descartes had conjectured, 'there exist innumerable other creatures of higher quality than ourselves'.'4 John Ray himself would assert that it was now a 'received hypothesis' that every star is a sun with planets 'in all likelyhood furnished with as great a variety of corporeal Creatures animate and inanimate as the Earth is'.'5 In the Cartesian corpus, there are explicit critiques of the notion that our sun shines only for our benefit. At a deeper epistemological level, Descartes chided our presumption in imagining that final causes in nature could be known. How could we 201</page><page sequence="4">John Hedley Brooke presume to know the mind and purposes of God?16 Moreover, in both Descartes and Boyle we find an indictment of anthropocentric criteria in the adjudication of scientific theories. For Descartes, it would be ridiculous to want to use the opinion that all things were created for us as a basis for physical reasonings. It was ridiculous because there were many things in the world, and many that had ceased to exist, without any man having seen, known or used them.17 In the mechanical philosophies of the 17th century, there had been a dislocation of another kind. From having been integrated in the cosmos, the human observer became the detached spectator of a bleak cosmic machine.18 The loss of the microcosm/macrocosm analogies implied a certain loss of self-centredness. A traditional view had been expressed by Nicholas Culpeper in his Herbal of 1653: 'the admirable harmony of the creation is herein seen, in the influence of stars upon herbs and the body of man ... one part of the creation is subservient to the other, and all for the use of man'.19 By the second half of the 17th century, however, more radical positions had certainly been voiced in England. Keith Thomas could cite the Civil War sectary who protested that God loves toads as well as the best saints.20 It would be possible to add other centrifugal forces. But there is a problem with such routine accounts. They are made possible only by the streamlining of issues and the neglect of debate. In the period that has come to be known as the 'scientific revolution' there were counter-currents to these centrifugal tendencies. Some are well known. For example, an essay on the wisdom of God was published in 1688. Its author was not Ray but Boyle, and a Boyle engaged in a detailed critique of Descartes's position on final causes. Contrary to Descartes's strictures Boyle insisted that some of God's purposes could be investigated and known. There was a large variety of eyes in the world, but anyone could see that they had been designed to see with. In Boyle's opinion, Descartes had overreacted to the Aristotelian Schoolmen for whom all things had been made solely or chiefly for us.21 Boyle had no inhibition in saying that a 'great number' of God's works were 'particularly subservient' to human needs.22 This counterpoint to the decentring of humanity deserves re-examination. It might be called the reconfiguration of a central self. RECENTRING THROUGH COSMOLOGY As Arthur Lovejoy observed long ago, the greatest challenge to an anthropocentric cosmos came not from Copernican astronomy per se but from the cosmological vision of Giordano Bruno.23 Bruno's translation of the infinite power of God into an infinite Universe and an infinite plurality of worlds had been a deeply disturbing challenge, rarely captured more eloquently than by C.S. Lewis when he contrasted two views of the cosmos. In the older, to look up at the night sky was like looking into the vault of a Gothic cathedral; in Bruno's Universe it was to be cast adrift on a shoreless sea.24 But there was the counter-current. There was resistance to Bruno and from no less an astronomical giant than Kepler. As Kepler shows, there could be a recentring 202</page><page sequence="5">John Ray, natural theology and the meanings of anthropocentrism through cosmology. The Earth might no longer be at the centre of the cosmos but it could still be said to occupy the central orbit in a heliocentric system. If our Sun could be shown to be unique, to be the biggest and brightest sun in the Universe, a sense of cosmic identity could be protected. In Kepler we see an explicit attempt to demonstrate that 'we men find ourselves on the globe which is most suited to the most important and most noble rational creature among all physical bodies'.25 Since the central sun for Kepler was a visible and spatial symbol of the living God, there was a sense in which it would have been inappropriate for man, in his wretchedness, to be placed too close to that regal throne.26 In Kepler we find the coexistence of the radical and the anthropocentric. Jupiter's moons were made principally for the residents of Jupiter, but residents of the Earth enjoyed the greater privileges. It must also be remembered that empirical evidence did not obviously support the ultra-radicalism of Bruno. Kepler had been concerned when he first heard of satellites seen through Galileo's telescope. Had they been satellites of stars, they would have given substance to other planetary systems. Scholars have detected Kepler's relief when he learnt they were merely moons of Jupiter.27 'If you had discovered planets rotating around one of the fixed stars', he wrote to Galileo, 'the stock and prison were already ready for me by way of Bruno's innumerability, or rather exile into that infinity. For the moment you have therefore freed me from the great fear which had welled in me at the first news of your book.'28 Although popular accounts of the Copernican revolution continue to stress the decentring, the case for a recentring through cosmology was far from hollow. Indeed the English Copernican John Wilkins, FR.S., remarked that one of the commonest objections he had encountered to the Copemican system was that it elevated man above his true station.29 Given the Aristotelian dichotomy between the perfection of the heavens and the imperfection of the sub-lunar regions, to project the Earth into the heavens was to enhance its status. Galileo could rejoice that the human race had escaped from the refuse tip of the Universe.30 For Kepler, too, it was a case not of degradation but of elevation as we at last assumed our appointed place as true citizens of the heavens. It was those who stressed the vileness of the Earth who insisted that it had to be at the centre-as far removed as possible from the heavenly sphere. The Jesuit mathematician Christopher Clavius, sometimes described as the last of the Ptolemaic astronomers, illustrates precisely that position. It was so entrenched that a recent biographer speaks of a 'deep prejudice' in favour of the correlation between centrality and corruptibility and of humanity's lowly status in the cosmos.3' By contrast, one could exult in a new anthropocentrism made possible by a moving Earth. For Kepler it was not a case of dethronement but re-enthronement. What better vantage point could there be for appreciating the beauty and majesty of creation than our privileged position, centrally placed among the planets?32 It may be, as Paolo Rossi has argued, that Kepler never ceased to be haunted by the vista conjured up by Bruno.33 Yet his insistence on human elevation, rather than diminution, in the wake of Copernicus was strongly rooted in his epistemology. In what has been seen as the birth of the history and philosophy of science, Kepler marshalled historical evidence to demonstrate the reality of progress in astronomy.34 The 203</page><page sequence="6">John Hedley Brooke Coperican innovation could spell exhilaration at having surpassed the ancients in our knowledge of astronomy. And there could be an even deeper sense of elevation rather than relegation. The human mind, through the mediation of mathematics, was privileged to know something of the mind of God. That we could appreciate the geometry of the Universe underscored a recentring of the self that allowed Kepler famously to declare that in his work he was thinking God's thoughts after Him. This could be said to be a deeply anthropocentric assumption and it is one which, according to Raven, was shared by Ray.35 In a nutshell, a strong anthropocentricity could survive the Coperican innovation. RECENTRING THROUGH ANTHROPOMORPHISM There is no doubt that the mechanization of nature could lead to a violent dislocation, especially in its unreconstructed Epicurean forms. If humans were the product of the chance collision of atoms, final causes and divine purposes for the human race would have to be comprehensively banished from the Universe. It is not then merely the case that final causes cannot be known, as Descartes insisted; but that final causes do not exist. But it is not clear how many unreconstructed Epicureans existed in 17th-century England; and, far from decentring man, Providentialist reinterpretations of ancient atomism would keep the human race in the spotlight.36 It is important to note that serious qualifications to the scope of mechanism had been voiced by Ray's contemporaries. Ray himself sided with the Cambridge Platonist Ralph Cudworth against a crude mechanical Universe. Sympathetic to Cudworth's concept of a 'plastick principle' he celebrated sources of activity and creativity in nature. In this respect, Raven found his natural theology more attractive than that of his more familiar successor, William Paley.37 Ray's critique of an all-embracing mechanical philosophy was fortified with such examples as the ability of birds to feed all their nestlings. This showed a kind of memory at work, 'most strange and admirable, and beyond the possibility of a mere machine to perform'.38 Ray was particularly concerned by the fact that a simple juxtaposition of passive matter with a Sovereign God who had prescribed the laws of motion was too facile to cope with the complexity of the organic world. Vital principles offered a richer theology of nature than the clockwork Universe of Boyle, which Ray had initially read as deistic or potentially so.39 Ray's subsequent relief and apology, on reading Boyle's Christian Virtuoso, is a poignant indication of how when the Universe was compared with a clock or a watch, deism was but a hairspring away.40 Even assuming a complete mechanization of nature, the effect need not be one of diminishing humankind. A mechanical philosophy could bring man closer to God rather than his being lost to the divine gaze. One thing above all the mechanical philosophies promoted was the analogy between human and divine craftsmanship: both God and men were makers of machines. This assimilation of human and divine handiwork could be read as demeaning to the deity. Descartes had been spiked on that very point by Gisbert Voet, Rector of the University of Utrecht.41 It would also feature 204</page><page sequence="7">John Ray, natural theology and the meanings of anthropocentrism in David Hume's critique of natural theology where, in part 2 of the Dialogues concerning natural religion (1779), both Philo and Demea censure anthropomorphic images of the deity.42 But, conversely, the assimilation of human and divine craftsmanship could be seen as an elevation of man. Margaret Cook has recently spoken of the exact parallel between a carpenter-joiner and Boyle's artisan God.43 It was necessary for Boyle to extol the infinitely superior workmanship of God, but advances in instrumentation provided a perfect rhetoric for that purpose. In his Micrographia (1665), Robert Hooke observed that when seen through the microscope, and when compared with the filigree precision of natural objects, human artefacts made a sorry sight: 'the more we see of their shape, the less appearance will there be of their beauty'.44 The use of the microscope to affirm the transcendent quality of divine artistry was repeated by John Wilkins and by John Ray.45 Nevertheless, it is the elevation of the human that stands out. We know that Newton's religious conscience was pricked as he remembered having lied about a louse.46 For the Dutch naturalist Jan Swammerdam, the louse served not a self-abasement but an aggrandizement: 'Herewith I offer you the Omnipotent Finger of God in the anatomy of a louse: wherein you will find miracles heaped upon miracles'.47 This self-aggrandizement can be seen even more plainly in claims, however tacitly made, that man might imitate the creative activities of the deity. Such claims are well known in alchemical literature,48 but we also find them in Ray, who presumed to know that the deity 'is well pleased with the industry of man in adorning the Earth with beautiful cities and castles, with pleasant villages and country houses, with regular gardens and orchards and plantations'.49 Ray's reference to beauty in the works of God and man introduces a further mode of recentring-through the elevation of aesthetic sensibility. RECENTRING THROUGH AESTHETICS It is easy enough to see why the Copemican revolution and the mechanization of nature have been interpreted as eroding forms of anthropocentrism. But there is an ulterior issue concerning the grounds on which these new images of nature were advanced. Each of these models of the cosmos was promoted on aesthetic as much as empirical grounds. Claims were frequently made in the 17th century that the Universe now had a beauty, an elegance, an economy that had been less visible before. The more an appeal was made to such aesthetic criteria, the more were our aesthetic sensibilities raised in consequence.50 Copernicus himself had contrasted the symmetry and elegance of his system with the piecemeal analysis of planetary orbits by Ptolemy.51 John Ray was particularly eloquent on this theme: if it had once been rash and profane of Alfonso the Wise to presume to advise the deity on how he might have made a more elegant world than that implied by Ptolemy, how much greater the temerity, the profanity, had he done so on the basis of what was now known about the Universe.52 Expatiating on the excellence of his mechanical philosophy, Boyle spoke of its 205</page><page sequence="8">John Hedley Brooke virtues in terms that could equally be applied to a work of art: economy, simplicity, clarity, intelligibility and having the kind of comprehensibility that comes from visual representation.53 There was, in other words, a kind of anthropocentrism presupposed in the very processes that are claimed to have dislodged it. It can be seen in Newton's remark that divinely ordained laws were involved in the perception as well as the structure of all that was beautiful.54 As it has been expressed elsewhere: 'Creature and Creator were still tied by the very possibility of appreciating beauty. This was a form of anthropocentrism that science would find it hard to abolish because there was a sense in which it depended upon it'.55 This current runs very deep, because the justification of scientific activity in theological terms frequently elevated aesthetic sensibilities in precisely this way. Having enthused about the 'exquisite' beauty of nature, Walter Charleton, in one of the foundation texts ofphysico-theology, observed that it would be to no purpose were it not for man to admire.56 Henry More, to whom Ray was particularly indebted, likewise celebrated the beauty as well as the structure of living organisms.57 For later naturalists such as Linnaeus this was to become a recurrent refrain: there was a transparent duty to study God's works because we alone can appreciate them. The argument was not confined to clergyman naturalists. That same sense of duty was articulated by both Boyle and Ray. For Boyle, the natural philosopher did not have to be ordained to be a priest in the Temple of Nature.58 For Ray, the pious study of nature was a duty of the sabbath day. It revealed a beauty in the world that was not reducible to utility.59 Utility, however, was itself useful in re-admitting anthropocentric themes. RECENTRING THROUGH UTILITY This paper began with a reference to Peter Harrison's recent thesis. One facet of his argument concerns a shift from the symbolic meanings of natural objects to a preoccupation with their utility. In the 17th century, 'natural objects were regarded as having been designed for their utility rather than their meaning: creatures were not symbols to be read, but objects to be used or investigated for potential applications.60 Put another way: 'interpreting the book of the creatures became a matter of discerning the intention of its author'.61 Crucially that was an intention towards us. And that, in turn, raises the question whether all things were made for us. Nowadays, said Ray, wise men think otherwise. But Ray's position turns out to be less clear-cut than it sounds. Clearly there were things not made for our benefit alone. But did he actually say that some things were not made for us at all? Before answering that question, it is instructive to consider Boyle's reply to Descartes, who had placed a moratorium on the investigation of final causes. In his Wisdom of God, Ray would reflect on this controversy, siding with Boyle more than Descartes.62 Boyle conceded to Descartes that the sun was not made for us alone; but it did not follow that it was not made partly for our benefit. There was an important conservative element in Boyle, who chastised Descartes for having improperly ignored revelation. Neither for Boyle nor Ray was natural theology to be pursued independently 206</page><page sequence="9">John Ray, natural theology and the meanings of anthropocentrism of revelation, and this meant a restoration of the central self. Appealing to the book of Genesis, Boyle insisted that 'the design of God in making man was, that men should subdue the earth'.63 Genesis also informs us that, after the deluge, God delivered all terrestrial creatures 'into the hands of men'.64 Miracles, too, helped to restore an anthropocentric perspective. As Boyle put it, the laws of nature had been suspended 'upon the account of man'. This was true in the case of Noah's flood, the parting of the Red Sea, the long day of Joshua and the 'inefficacy of the burning fiery furnace'.65 It is important to recognize this conservative element in Boyle. He freely acknowledged that in the case of the stars, other uses may predominate; but that was precisely why he preferred to enlist organic structures to celebrate the beneficence of the deity towards his creatures and supremely to us. And what does Ray really say? In the Wisdom of God the form of words is that not everything was made for man alone. 'For my part', Ray declared, 'I cannot believe, that all the things in the world were so made for man, that they have no other use.'66 This formula, also to be found in Boyle, might be read as an invitation to consider the truly radical possibility that some things were not made for us at all. But that is not what is said. When Ray clarifies his position, the balance shifts towards a more conservative resolution. Objects that appear to be of no human use now, may well be to future generations. Boyle made the same point: the silkworm, sugar cane and cochineal, once despised or ignored, had each found a purpose.67 Henry More had also seized the silkworm, which 'seems to come into the world for no other purpose than to furnish man with more costly clothing'.68 For the recalcitrant anti-Coperican John Edwards, even fleas had their uses: they may bleed the poor 'and thus save them the charges of A Lancet'.69 As for John Ray, it remained the case that 'all the creatures in the world may be some way or other useful to us'.70 He had no difficulty with Henry More's qualification that 'the creatures are made to enjoy themselves'; but the sentence went on 'as well as to serve us'.71 And if we cannot currently see what their use might be, then that very perplexity is itself a useful spur. It provides exercise for our wits and by contemplating them we are led to admire our Maker. 'The world is so richly furnished', Ray proclaimed, that 'man need not fear want of employment, should he live to the age of Methusaleh, or ten times as long.'72 Ray made room in his Universe for angels and other rational beings; but there was a profound sense in which a plurality of worlds did not entail human diminution. To say that other worlds had been made principally for their inhabitants both reflected and reinforced the assumption that this earthly world was made for us. For all his wisdom in renouncing a crude anthropocentrism, Ray's qualifications tended to get overridden by his emphasis on nature's utility to man.73 There is another respect in which an anthropocentrism survived the revolution to which Keith Thomas referred. Where human dominion over nature was construed as a licence to exploit natural resources, rather than as a call to stewardship, the self- centredness of humanity was underlined rather than removed. There is real irony here, because Ray saw this kind of anthropocentrism as most pronounced in the putatively decentred world of Descartes. As Ray put it: 'those philosophers indeed, who hold man to be the only creature in this sublunary world, endued with sense and perception, and 207</page><page sequence="10">John Hedley Brooke that all other animals are mere machines or puppets, have some reason to think that all things here below were made for man'.74 RECENTRING THROUGH NATURAL THEOLOGY In his biography of Ray, Charles Raven celebrated a new type of theology, which he saw as a departure from both Catholic and Protestant dogmatics. This was Ray's celebration of the wisdom of God manifested in the works of creation-in the contrivances to which Boyle had referred, but also in the amazing instincts of birds and other creatures. This type of theology has been criticized on many grounds-that it focuses on concepts of creation at the expense of redemption and that, in so many ways, it would dig its own grave as advances in natural history and other sciences gradually took the mystery out of the world.75 As Raven recognized, Ray chose for his examples many of the marvellous phenomena of nature that would prove most resistant to rationalization-the migration patterns of birds, for example. Raven even claimed that Ray regaled his readers with phenomena that Darwin's theory would be unable to explain.76 Mention of Darwin, however, does point to one last respect in which an anthropocentrism survived in the writings of Ray and in those of many clergymen naturalists. From a Darwinian perspective the very enterprise of natural theology was incurably anthropocentric. It presupposed a special relationship between the mind of man and the mind of God. For Hugh Miller, writing in the 19th century just before Darwin published, the beauty of fossil forms showed that the divine and human minds shared the same aesthetic sensibilities. And for Miller, that was evidence from natural theology of the image of God in man.77 Darwin, as we know, was unmoved by a transcendental interpretation of bones. In an essay that touched on theology he considered Cuvier's explanation for abortive bones, only to reject the explanation as abortive. Cuvier had argued that skeletal structures reflected a 'determination to adhere to a plan once adopted' and that it was 'from these very circumstances, that we become satisfied respecting an original thought, or design, pursued to an utmost exhaustion, and till it must be abandoned for another'. Darwin's comments were scathing: 'the design determiner of a God-head-the designs of an omnipotent creator, exhausted and abandoned. Such is man's philosophy, when he argues about his creator.'78 For man to argue about his Creator became, for Darwin, distasteful for other reasons. If the human mind had not been designed for metaphysical reflection, if, instead, it had gradually emerged through a convoluted evolutionary process, what guarantees were there that it was profitable to argue about the existence and attributes of a Creator at all? For Darwin there was to be a kind of arrogance in the pretensions of natural theology. As early as the second transmutation notebook that word arrogance appeared: 'man in his arrogance thinks himself a great work worthy the interposition of a deity, more humble &amp; I believe truer to consider him created from animals'.79 To be fair, there had been a humility in Ray. Empirical enquiries into the natural world 208</page><page sequence="11">John Ray, natural theology and the meanings of anthropocentrism had been commended by Francis Bacon precisely because they encouraged the Christian virtue of humility. One had to humble oneself before the wondrous facts of nature rather than spin arrogant webs of theory from one's own mind. There was even humility in another sense. Ray's primary aim was not to demonstrate the existence of God from the appearance of design in nature. It needed no demonstration. With his sharp eye for detail, Raven noted how Ray's argument was more subtle and modest: given a pre-existing belief in a wise Creator, that wisdom was discernible in nature- and discernible by the most illiterate person. 'To them that acknowledge the being of a Deity', Ray declared, it is 'little less than a demonstration' that God's creatures were created intentionally for the uses we have found them to have. Ray allowed other uses, too, but the striking point here is that he posits a prior belief in God, which a natural theology could corroborate.8° For all its subtlety, however, Ray's treatise would have to be seen, from a Darwinian perspective, as anthropocentric. Ray's observations on the admirable design of the swallow for catching gnats were made in the belief that all events in nature were ultimately under the control of a divine providence. The wonderful instincts of God's creatures, directed to ends unknown to them, were like a kind of 'fate upon them'.81 But, having succumbed to a rising tide of unbelief, Darwin would write of swallows and gnats in a very different way. He would ask Asa Gray whether Gray really believed that when a swallow caught a gnat it had been predetermined that that particular gnat would be swallowed by that particular swallow at that particular moment. Many do believe that, Darwin added; but he could not. The same applied in the case of a man struck by lightning.82 There was something deeply anthropocentric about the belief that the Universe had been micro-managed. In Darwin that background belief, so visible in Boyle and Ray, was verging on the risible. CONCLUSION It would be foolish to deny that the late 17th century saw a significant shift in how we came to conceive of ourselves in relation to a restructured Universe. New perspectives were required. When speaking of divine ends in nature, Boyle had insisted that there were at least four different kinds, only one of which related to human concerns. He was as adamant as Descartes that anthropocentric criteria were not to be used when evaluating theories about the nature of matter or the structure of the Universe.83 Indeed, it is impossible to read early 18th-century works of physico- theology without detecting a sense of liberation from an old anthropocentrism in which everything was made for man. In William Derham's Astro-Theology of 1715 there is both a sense of exhilaration at the prospect of a Universe full of other worlds and a degree of condescension towards that older view. The value of this new system, he wrote, is that it provides a 'far more extensive, grand, and noble view of God's works' than did the 'old vulgar opinion, that all things were made for man'.84 However, I have tried to show that the concept of anthropocentricity is a slippery one. It can have many shades of meaning. Between the proposition that things were 209</page><page sequence="12">John Hedley Brooke made exclusively for man and the proposition that they were not made for man was a long continuum of possibilities-including that they were chiefly, or only minimally, made for man. And there was another long continuum between a few things and all things. Those developments in 17th-century natural philosophy which ostensibly destroyed the view that all was made for man provided genuine qualifications; but in several respects they were only that-qualifications to a position that was otherwise untenable and perhaps something of a straw man. Boyle felt that it had been a straw man for Descartes. There were surely 'few able writers, that confine the utility of the sun directly to the affording light to man'.85 The Copernican innovation, for all its centrifugal tendencies, could still accommodate a centripetal configuration; the mechanical philosophy, for all its dislocation, arguably brought man and his Maker closer together. In both developments, arguments based on aesthetic judgement were sufficiently prominent to raise the status of the natural philosopher as an aesthete. And as Anthony O'Hear has recently observed in a commentary on Kant's aesthetics, 'If nature has been designed for our taste, then presumably much else in it must be for us.'86 O'Hear in fact goes further: 'Anthropocentric as it is, based in us as it is, it may be the case that aesthetic experience reveals something of the world's inner essence, and that it heals the rift opened up by objectifying, decentring science between us and the world.'87 In Ray's day, that rift was not as wide as it was to become. But the description seems to fit Ray's own appreciation of the wonder and beauty of nature. The uses of nature for John Ray were manifold. Wise men now knew that all things were not made for man alone; but all things were still of some use to man. And as we have just seen, the very enterprise of natural theology could be described as a form of anthropocentrism. For clergymen naturalists it was almost bound to be so. Superficially perhaps it was not. Contemplating the uses of poisonous plants, William Derham in his Physico-Theology came out with the classic line that hemlock might be lethal to humans but was excellent food for goats.88 But that disjunction between the sheep and the goats was not absolute. Goats in their turn were suppliers of food, and not merely food for thought. NOTES 1 P.
