<plain_text><page sequence="1">TECHNICAL EXAMINATION AND RESTORATION OF A CEREMONIAL SHIELD FROM THE SOLOMON ISLANDS E. Kenndler, F. Mairinger, W. P. Bauer, F. Rainer and K. Schmidt-Beiwl Abstract-The materials of a shell-inlaid shield (wicker, paste layer and mother-of-pearl) were subjec- ted to a technical examination. The wicker and the mother-of-pearl were examined by microscopy and the materials used were identified by visual com- parison with appropriate reference materials. The paste layer was analyzed using microchemical meth- ods. The fatty acid analysis of the oleaginous binding medium of the paste layer was carried out by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The fatty acid composition of a tropical nut (Parinarium hahlii Warb.), potentially used as binding medium, was investigated. The main component was identified as the highly unsaturated elaeostearic acid (9,11,13- octadecatrienoic acid). For reference purposes, the pulp material of the kernels of the parinarium nut was artificially aged. The resulting gas chromatographic pattern was found to correspond qualitatively with that of the paste layer, supporting the assumption that parinarium nuts were applied as the binding media for such shields. The consolidation of the shield was car- ried out using a stabilizing emulsion, which was spe- cially developed for this purpose. The restoration of the shield is described in detail, especially the replace- ment of 262 shell chips. 1 Introduction 1.1 The object One of the most precious objects of the Museum of Ethnology in Vienna from the Oceanic region is a ceremonial shield (Inv. No. 3859), originat- ing from the Solomon Islands. It is inlaid with mother-of-pearl (Figure 1). As far as is known, no other such shields exist now in the Solomon Islands, and only about 20 comparable examples exist in museums and private collections [1]. Based on comparison with similar objects [2]-all of them fashioned during the middle or second half of the nineteenth century-it can be assumed, that the shield originates from either Santa Isabel, Florida, New Georgia or Guadalcanal. The shield was collected during the circum- Received 29 September 1987 navigation of the globe by the Austrian frigate 'Novara', carried out for research purposes. As a result of our inquiries we have shown that the shield was not acquired during the (very limited) previous contacts with the Solomon Islanders, but was probably acquired in the autumn of 1858 in Sydney. As sources for this research, the ~~4' e911~1; r i i ,~11111 r Figure 1 Face of the shell-inlaid ceremonial shield from the Solomon Islands (after restoration).

Schmidt-Beiwl ship's log of the 'Novara' [3], the diary of a sailor [3], the report of the responsible ethnologist [4, 5], the commander's report [6], newspaper reports [7], etc., were used. The interpretation of the sources available led to the shield being incorrectly classified as a 'Shield from the Fiji Islands', which appeared for example in the cata- logues for the exhibitions describing the 'Novara' expedition (1860 in Trieste and 1860-61 in the Augarten palace in Vienna), as well as in the Illustrierte Zeitung No. 875 of 7 April 1860 (p.253) showing the oldest picture of the shield, and in the museum's inventory. 1.2 Description of the shield The elliptically-formed body of the shield (84cm long, 28cm wide) is made of one piece of wick- erwork, carefully fashioned in elongated spirals. The face carries symmetrical inlay work, con- sisting of 2,706 small, squared chips of mother- of-pearl on a partially black, partially brick-red background. This background is formed by a layer of paste over the wickerwork which has a thickness of several millimetres. It can be seen from Figure 1 that the inlay work shows a strongly abstract, thin, anthropomorphic figure in the upper three-quarters along the central axis of the shield. This figure may be interpreted either as a chieftain, as a mighty, legendary ancestor, as a god or as a phallic symbol. Labyrinth-like, calligraphic ornamentations, reminiscent of the fish-traps of the islanders-- perhaps having the purpose of confusing or catching demons and guardian spirits of enemies-are found in the lower quarter and on the top end of the shield. Small, stylized heads, which may symbolize defeated enemies, are arranged near the horizontal axis and in the lower quarter. The number and size of the heads are different from other comparable objects [2]. One chip of shell from the lower third of the shield, which had been lost, must have been restored by the Solomon Islanders themselves since, although original, it is not grooved like the other chips and is reglued with the original, but non-coloured, paste. Besides a piece of tortoise shell, mounted as a hand protection, and a supportive construction made of wooden crosspieces, the reverse side of the shield also features a black pattern on the wicker, characteristic of war shields. This pat- tern, as well as a damaged area on the left margin of the wickerwork which had been retouched with the typical layer of paste, is evidence for the fact that the shield had already been in use before it was ornamented with mother-of-pearl. 1.3 Materials of the shield Prior to the restoration, the materials used for the preparation of the shield had to be investigated, using literature sources as well as technical examination. Three types of materials of interest can be differentiated: the wicker, the layer of paste and the mother-of-pearl. The wicker forms the stable body of the shield, and consists of split lianas. The layer of paste, cov- ering the body of the shield, was apparently used in three different modifications: unpigmented as a layer into which the chips of mother-of-pearl were pressed, as a pasty mass coloured with black pigment, and finally as a fluid binder, col-. oured with a red pigment. The chips of shell, used for the inlay, were squares with side lengths of about 5mm. The chips show one cut on two sides of the square, and three cuts on the other two sides. Although general descriptions and indications with respect to the materials applied for the preparation of shields of the Solomon Islands exist in the literature [1, 2], no specific investigations were found dealing with such objects. Therefore, the technical examination had to cover the different materials from which the shield was made. As only a few results of chemical analysis of the materials used as a potential source for the binding media have been published, an extensive analytical examination was carried out. 1.4 Extent of damage The restoration was necessary because many of the chips of shell had fallen off, especially in recent years. This damage created a discon- certing and even disturbing condition. The reason why the shell inlay had fallen off is not attributed to chemical change in the paste layer. This damage is assumed to be caused by the decomposition of the mother-of-pearl, which is in contact with the layer of paste. This conclu- sion may be drawn from the observation of a mealy deposit in places where the chips have cracked off, and from the fact that the backs of the chips have become soft and chalky. Another disturbing effect was caused by earlier attempts 116 Studies in Conservation 33 (1988) 115-125</page><page sequence="3">Technical examination and restoration of a ceremonial shield from the Solomon Islands at restoration, using roughly-fashioned chips of mother-of-pearl, which did not match the origi- nal in hue and lustre. Moreover, remnants of glue, partly from the attempts at restoration, partly from re-attachment of the original chips, carried out in a very poor manner, were also disturbing. At the outset of the restoration, 237 damaged areas were examined. The positions of these spots and those of the previously restored chips which were removed during the restoration [8, 9] are indicated by black squares in the schematic presentation of the face of the shield shown in Figure 2. Eighty-one chips which had fallen off were preserved. A B Figure 2 Schematic drawing of the face of the shield, indicating by black squares the positions of (A) the 237 initially damaged areas and (B) the previously restored chips which were removed during the present restora- tion. Some of the cracks in the paste layer, which had been formed at right angles to the wick- erwork, are probably primary cracks and pose no greatly disturbing aesthetic problem. At close observation, a fine network of sec- ondary cracks and, in some places, a light peel- ing were found, especially near the inlay work. This damage was regarded as another important reason for the necessity of the present restora- tion. One of the two symmetrical loops on the back of the shield has also been lost. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials for restoration and chemical analysis For the restoration attempts, the following materials were used: an aqueous dispersion of polyvinylacetate (Planatol BB Superior, W. Hes- selmann, Rosenheim, FRG), polyvinylalcohol (E. Merck, Darmstadt, FRG), methylcellulose (1500, Serva, Heidelberg, FRG), hydroxy- propylcellulose (Klucel HF, Hercules Inc., Wilmington, Delaware, USA), and butyl- polymethacrylate (Paraloid F-10, Rohm and Haas, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA). A wet- ting agent (Nekal BX, BASF, Ludwigshaven, FRG) and a preservative (Nipagin, E. Merck) were used as required. As an adhesive, a silicon gum (Elastosil A-33, Wacker, Burghausen, FRG) was employed. All solvents and chemicals used for gas chro- matography were of p.a. grade (E. Merck). Fatty acid methyl esters used as reference substances were either obtained from pure standards (Chrompack, Middelburg, The Neth- erlands), or were prepared by hydrolysis and methylation of different oils of known composition, such as linseed oil. Parinarium hahlii Warb. was received from Port Moresby, New Guinea. 2.2 Apparatus 2.2.1 Gas chromatography The gas chromatograph (HRGC 5300 Mega Series, Carlo Erba, Milan, Italy) was equipped with a flame ionization detector. The detector signal was recorded with an integrator (Mega Series). The gas chromatography was performed with two fused silica capillary columns (both 15m length, 0-32mm I.D., Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, USA), coated with two different stationary phases: polydimethylsiloxane (OV1) and polyethyleneglycol (Carbowax 20M). The film thickness was 0-2im in both columns. Studies in Conservation 33 (1988) 115-125 117</page><page sequence="4">E. Kenndler, F. Mairinger, W. P. Bauer, F. Rainer and K. Schmidt-Beiwl Carrier gas was nitrogen (99-999%, Messer- Griesheim, Diisseldorf, FRG). The measure- ment of the retention indices was carried out isothermally at 180'C on OVi and at 200'C on Carbowax 20M. The temperature of the injector and detector was kept at 2500C. The split ratio was 1:20. 2.2.2 Mass spectrometry The recording of the low resolution, electron impact mass spectra was carried out with an instrument (model 8230, Finnegan MAT, Bremen, FRG) directly connected to a gas chromatograph (model 3400, Varian, Walnut Creek, USA). The electron energy was 70eV. The temperature of the ion source was 260'C, that of the interface with the gas chromatograph 250'C. Carrier gas was helium (99-999%, Messer-Griesheim). 2.2.3 Degradation and aging The degradation and aging experiments were carried out by the use of a UV-lamp (model 29 200, Camag, Muttenz, Switzerland) at 366nm. 2.3 Hydrolysis and methylation of the fatty acids The hydrolysis of milligram amounts of oils or of the shield material was carried out in the usual way [10-12] by refluxing the sample in Iml of a methanolic KOH solution (0-5 mol/1) for six minutes. After cooling, Iml methanolic BF3 solution (20% BF3 w/w) was added and the mix- ture was again heated for six minutes. After cooling, Iml of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (iso- octane) and 5ml of a saturated aqueous NaCl solution were added and the mixture was shaken for one minute. After the separation of the phases, an aliquot of the organic layer was injec- ted directly into the gas chromatograph. If the analyte concentration was too low, the solvent of the organic layer was evaporated and the residue was redissolved in a few tens of microlitres of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane. 3 Technical examination 3.1 Body of the shield The body of the shield consists of wickerwork, formed by a variety of split liana. Based on ref- erences found in the literature [13, 14], the exam- inations by microscopy led to the result that lianas of the calamus variety, probably Calamus caesius Bl., Calamus trachycoleus Becc. or Cala- mus ornatus Bl., were used for the wicker. 3.2 Layer of paste It is obvious that the materials used for the prep- aration of the layer of paste were those naturally occurring in the region of the Solomon Islands. Therefore one can suppose that the pigments as well as the binding media originate from sources commonly available in this area. 3.2.1 Pigments One can expect that the black pigment added to the binding media for the paste is a type of car- bon black. In fact, the black grains inside this layer could be clearly identified by microscopic investigations as a pigment similar to vine black. It is described in the literature [15] that this black carbon pigment, named masusuri, was derived by pulverizing charcoal, made from so-called toko trees. Furthermore, it was confirmed by positive microchemical tests that the red layer above the black paste, which was applied on some parts of the shield with an average thickness of about 0-06mm, contains Fe203, indicating the use of a ferrous red earth pigment, analogous to those found near Gieta on Bougainville [16]. 3.2.2 Binding media In order to identify the origin of the binding media of the paste layer, several microchemical tests [17] were carried out as a first step. The microchemical nitrogen test for the identification of proteins was weakly positive, probably originating from natural plant pro- teins. On the other hand, the test for alkaline saponification was highly positive. This result is supported by indications found in the literature [1, 2, 16], describing the crushed pulp of the kernels of tropical nuts to be used for such objects. These kernels have a high content of fatty acids. Therefore, the fatty acid profile of the material of the layer of paste was examined. The corresponding chromatogram obtained from the methyl esters of the fatty acids is shown in Figure 3. It can be seen that palmitic (16:0), stearic (18:0), oleic (18:1), linoleic (18:2) and linolenic acid (18:3) are the main fatty acid com- ponents of this material. It can further be seen that in the region below 16:0 there are some 118 Studies in Conservation 33 (1988) 115-125</page><page sequence="5">Technical examination and restoration of a ceremonial shield from the Solomon Islands 16:0 18:0 18:1 18:2 S8 - 16 /18:3 0 8 16 t/min Figure 3 Gas chromatogram of the methyl esters of the fatty acids from the paste layer of the ceremonial shield.

The symbols of the fatty acids and their methyl esters respectively, which are used in the text as well as in the figures, consist of two num- bers, a:b. The first number, a, indicates the num- ber of carbon atoms in the chain, and the second, b, indicates the number of double bonds in the molecule. 3.2.3 Parinarium nuts As it is known that Parinarium laurinum and Parinarium hahlii Warb., two tropical trees from the Rosaceae family, subfamily Chryso- balamaceae, occur naturally on the Solomon Islands, these plants can plausibly be considered as a source of the binding media. The pulp of the kernels of Parinarium hahlii Warb. is especially indicated for such materials [16]. Typical for Parinaria is the presence of highly unsaturated fatty acids in the oil of their kernels. These acids are responsible for the 'drying' prop- erties of the oil. The oil of P. laurinum consists mainly of highly unsaturated parinaric acid (9,11,13,15- octadecatetraenoic acid) [18, 19]. The corre- sponding fatty acid composition of P. hahlii Warb. has not yet been published and was there- fore examined by us [20]. The composition is shown in the chrom- atogram presented in Figure 4. Although 16:0, 18:0, 18:1, 18:2 and 18:3 are found as constitu- ents of the oil, the main component, eluted at a higher retention time, is represented by none of these acids. It seemed obvious that this main component is parinaric acid, due to the high botanical relationship of P. laurinum and P. hah- lii Warb. [21]. In order to verify this assumption, this compound was investigated by mass spec- trometry. The resulting spectrum is presented in Figure 5, and shows the characteristic pattern of fatty acid methyl esters with the typical distribu- tion of the peaks of the aliphatic fragments in the lower mass over charge (m/e) range. Addi- tionally, one can see the occurrence of the molec- ular ion in the higher m/e range. In contrast to the expectation mentioned above, this molecular ion has, however, a nominal mass of 292, indi- cating the methyl ester of an acid with 18 carbon atoms in the chain, but with only three double 16:0 18:1 18:0 18:2 18:3 0 8 16 tlmin Figure 4 Gas chromatogram of the methyl esters of the fatty acids of the pulp of the kernel of Parinarium hahlii Warb.

The mass spectrum is nearly identical with that of the methyl ester of linolenic acid, but this compound was found to be eluted at a totally different position in the chromatogram. The mass spectrometric infor- mation indicates, therefore, the presence of an octadecatrienoic acid, but does not allow us to differentiate between the particular isomers. Gas chromatography on two different station- ary phases with different migration character- istics for the substances under consideration was therefore applied to obtain additional informa- tion about the type of isomers. For this purpose, nonpolar OVI and polar Carbowax 20M were used as stationary phases, and the migration behaviour of the particular isomeric esters was characterized by the differences of the retention indices, Ii, of the single components, i, on the different columns: AIi = li(Carbowax) - I,(OV1). A large index difference indicates the presence of polar or polarizable groups in the molecule of the analyte. This was found, in fact, for the unknown major component: the difference is 562 retention index units, compared with 308 units for stearic acid, 18:0, and 465 units for linolenic acid, 18:3. We can therefore assume that, in con- trast to linolenic acid (where the double bonds are isolated by CH2 groups), the three double bonds in the unknown major constituent are positioned so as to form a (highly polarizable) conjugated system. With this result one can conclude that the unknown constituent is the methyl ester of elaeostearic acid (9,11,13-octadecatrienoic acid). This conclusion 120 Studies in Conservation 33 (1988) 115-125</page><page sequence="7">Technical examination and restoration of a ceremonial shield from the Solomon Islands is plausible, as this acid is found in the oils of other Parinaria, although as a minor constituent [19]. However, the comparison of the chro- matograms from the parinarium nut and from the material of the layer of paste, presented in Figures 3 and 4, shows significant differences in the profiles of the fatty acids. On the other hand, this direct comparison is inadequate, because it does not take into account possible aging pro- cesses of the shield material. In order to enable this comparison to be carried out more com- pletely, the material of the parinarium nut was subjected to an artificial aging procedure. el.ac 400- 200- 0 o 10 20 30 t/h- Figure 6 Degradation of elaeostearic acid in the pulp material of the kernel of the parinarium nut by irra- diation with UV-light. The content of elaeostearic acid (el. ac.) is related to saturated stearic acid in the partic- ular aliquots; t = time of exposure to UV-light of 366nm. 3.2.4 Aging of the fatty acids of Parinarium hahlii Warb. Finely distributed material of the pulp of a ker- nel of the parinarium nut was placed in a thin layer on a plane glass plate and exposed to radi- ation from a UV-lamp at 366nm under ambient conditions. At the beginning of the procedure and after different times of exposure, the fatty acid composition of aliquots was determined. The resulting curve is presented in Figure 6. One can see an exponential decrease of the relative content of elaeostearic acid with increasing time of exposure, due to the degradation of elaeostearic acid. After 30 hours, only about 10% of the original content of this acid remains undegraded in the parinarium material. The chromatogram of the fatty acid methyl esters after 30 hours of exposure is presented in Figure 16:0 18:0 18:2 F- 18:3 O 8 16 t min 0 8 16 t/rain Figure 7 Fatty acid composition of the pulp of the kernel of the parinarium nut after irradiation with UV- light of 366nm for 30 hours.

The chromatogram obtained after the exposure to UV-light is, however, in good qual- itative agreement with that of Figure 3 obtained from the shield material. Although the identity of both materials is not positively confirmed by this comparison, the results support the assump- tion that the binding medium used for the preparation of the layer of paste of the shield originates from such parinarium nuts. 3.3 Mother-of-pearl The material of the shell inlay was examined, based on descriptions found in the literature [2] on the one hand and visual comparison with a large number of different shells of various molluscs [22] on the other. As a result, the mother-of-pearl was identified as originating from nautilus (Nautilus pompilius). 4 Restoration The most important conservation measure was the consolidation of the disintegrated backs of the shell chips and of the paste layer. A consolidant suitable for this purpose should have low viscosity, high dispersibility, good Studies in Conservation 33 (1988) 115-125 121</page><page sequence="8">E. Kenndler, F. Mairinger, W. P.

As a result of previous experiments, the mix- ture given in Table I was found to be an accept- able solution. This stabilizing emulsion was introduced into the cracks of the paste layer with the aid of a syringe. The consolidation procedure was repeated about 20 times over a period of two months. After that time it was assumed that the loose parts of the layer of paste, as well as the chips of mother-of-pearl, had been consolidated satisfactorily. The most decisive restoration measure with respect to the appearance of the shield was the replacement and renewal of 262 chips of mother- of-pearl. This total arises partly from the chips which had fallen off and partly from the chips which had to be removed because the common mother-of-pearl (probably Meleagrina mar- garitifera L.) used in former restoration attempts led to unsatisfactory results with respect to the form, hue, lustre, thickness and smoothness of their surface. Therefore it was important to apply the original variety of mother-of-pearl. For this purpose, a selection was made from commercially available nautilus shells, accord- ing to hue and lustre. The two nautilus shells chosen were cut into about 600 chips using a thin carborundum sanding disk. These rough chips were initially prepared to be somewhat larger than those of the originals on the shield. The concave inside surface of the chips was sanded flat. The rough chips were selected for thickness, size and hue, corresponding to those of the dam- aged areas. Their sides were fashioned to the proper dimensions. Cuts analogous to those found in the originals were made into the chips with a sharp-edged file. A pattern of grooves was cut into the backs of the chips using a serrated knife, to ensure better adhesion after glueing. Remnants of glue from former restoration work were removed from the damaged areas using a scalpel, cotton swabs and acetone before re-glueing the chips. The chips were affixed using a silicon gum, free of acetic acid, as an adhesive. This material offers the advantage of good elasticity, minimal shrinkage and relatively good reversibility. Good elasticity of the adhesive is required in order to accommodate the expansion and shrinkage of the wickerwork and the layer of paste. The rather limited adhesion of the silicon gum guarantees that restored chips may be removed and the adhesive scraped off: the dried film can be rubbed off easily. It should be mentioned that the aqueous suspension of the hardened gum shows a neutral pH. After the chips had been glued, the excess sil- icon gum was removed from the cuts between the chips. All the new chips were sanded before attachment, using fine sandpaper, to accommo- date them to the original ones. In the next step, the areas along the chips were filled, especially along the edges of the restored ones, where the layer of paste had cracked off. The paste applied for this purpose had also to be drawn up to the edges of the restored chips. The most important requirements for the properties of this paste were durable elasticity, satisfactory adhesion to the mother-of-pearl, some reversibility and, finally, a good match to the colour and finish of the original paste. The mixtures given in Table 2, and different combinations of them, were exam- ined as binding media with respect to the proper- ties mentioned. Further experiments were 122 Studies in Conservation 33 (1988) 115-125</page><page sequence="9">Technical examination and restoration of a ceremonial shield from the Solomon Islands Table 2 Mixtures examined for their suitability as paste materials (for details, see text) Substance Concentration Polyvinylalcohol 10% (w/v) in water Methylcellulose 3% (w/v) in water Rabbit skin glue 13% (w/v) in water Hydroxypropylcellulose 10% (w/v) in propan-2-ol Polyvinylacetate dispersion Butylpolymethacrylate 20% (w/v) in toluene The materials are specified in Section 2. carried out using mixtures of unbleached bees- wax, colophony and dammar varnish. Pigments were added to the mixtures, together with chalk or titanium dioxide to adjust the brightness. As a result of these experiments, the dis- persion of polyvinylacetate was found to best approach the properties required for the binding medium. The tendency to shrink while drying was of minor importance, because the damaged areas were only small in size. Due to the strong cohesion and the elasticity of the paste, sufficient flexibility and mechanical stability was impar- ted. Excess paste had to be removed immediately after application; it would not be possible to remove it after hardening with the usual wet cleaning reagents. Damaged areas of red coloration were first filled using the black paste, and were then retouched with low-viscosity red paste, consist- ing of a mixture of earth pigments with a diluted dispersion of polyvinylacetate. Since it was pos- sible to fill most of the parts of the surface (except the craquelure) by the method described, further retouching was unnecessary. Spaces between the restored chips and the (also partly blackish) networks of craquelure in the red areas were retouched using pure dry pig- ment, in order either to diminish or to enhance the tiny cracks according to need. The black pigment in the areas between the restored chips was fixed using a solution of hydroxy- propylcellulose, given in Table 2. The surface was partially cleaned with the aid of cotton swabs, saliva and distilled water before coating with paste and the same operation was carried out thoroughly at completion of the work, including the reverse side of the shield. The result of the cleaning procedure was most apparent in the red areas, which appeared much brighter and more reflective after the removal of the thick layer of dust and dirt. In order to adapt the freshly sanded surface of the new chips of shell completely to the originals, which had already become yellowed, it was finally lightly dyed with a dilute aqueous solu- tion of potassium permanganate.

Resumi--Les materiaux constitutifs d'un bouchier incrust6 de coquilles (a savoir osier, couche de colle et nacre) ont 6t6 soumis a une analyse technique. L'osier et la nacre ont 6t6 examines au microscope et les mate- riaux employes ont 6t6 identifies par comparaison a l'oeil avec des materiaux de ref6rence appropries. La couche de colle a 6t6 analysee par microchimie, et I'analyse des acides gras du medium huileux a 6th effectu&amp;e par chromatographie gazeuse et spec- tromrtrie de masse.

Zusammenfassung-Die Materialien eines Schildes mit Perlmutteinlagen (Korbgeflecht, Klebeschicht, Perlmutt) wurden untersucht. Unter Vergleich mit geeigneten Referenzproben wurden das Korbgeflecht und das Perlmutt mikroskopisch identifiziert. Mikrochemische Methoden dienten zur Analyse der Klebeschicht. Die Fettsiurebestimmung des 61lhaltigen Bindemittels der Klebeschicht wurde mit Hilfe von gaschromatographischen/massenspektro- metrischen Verfahren durchgefifihrt. Erganzend hierzu wurde erstmals das Fettsiureprofil der tro- pischen NuB Parinarium hahlii Warb., die m6glichenfalls als Rohstoff fiir das Bindemittel ver- wendet wurde, untersucht. Dabei fand sich als Hauptbestandteil die dreifach ungesittigte Elaeostearinsaure (9,11,13-Octadecatriensiure, sog. Holzolfettsiure). Zum Vergleich wurde das Mark der Kerne der ParinariumnuB kiinstlich gealtert: Das resultierende Gaschromatogramm entspricht qual- itativ dem der Klebeschicht. Dies scheint die Ver- mutung zu stiitzen, daB Parinariumniisse als Ausgangsmaterial ffir das Bindemittel derartiger Objekte Verwendung fanden. Zur Stabilisierung des Schildes wurde ein hierzu eigens entwickeltes Festi- gungsmittel eingesetzt. Die Restaurierung des Schil- des wird detailliert beschrieben, wobei insbesondere auf die Wiedereinfuigung der 262 Perlmuttstiickchen eingegangen wird.
