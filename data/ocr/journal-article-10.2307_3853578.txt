<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CARNARVON IVORY' BY GEORGES BENEDITE (Continued from p. 15.) II IT is now necessary to examine, in the light of the new ivory, the scenes which adorn the knife-handles of the Brooklyn Museum and the Pitt-Rivers collection. I shall henceforth refer to the knife-handles of the Brooklyn Museum and the Pitt- Rivers collection as handles I and II respectively, while the Carnarvon ivory will be known as handle III. For the Brooklyn handle (I) see below P1. XXXIV, and for the Pitt-Rivers handle (II), below p. 227. In the first place, several common characteristics appear in the three related objects: (a) The animals are most usually grouped by species, and in most cases a whole row is devoted to each species. (b) The exceptions to this rule are not of an arbitrary kind; the proof of this being that they are reproditced on more than one handle. The Bull (Bos taurus)2 extends over two rows on the boss side of handle I, and on both sides of handle II. This is the only instance in which a species occupies more than one row. Animals represented by isolated units belong to fixed species and, as a rule, occupy identical positions. The Dog proper (Canisfamiliaris) is placed at the tail-end of the row in which it figures: handle I, boss side, fourth row; handle III, boss side, first row. This peculiarity extends to the Fishes, of which three species are found (see Tabular analysis, p. 229); they are placed at the rear of whatever row they appear in. The position of the Heron (Ardea cinerea) is no more arbitrary than that of the animals before-mentioned: it concludes the row of the large-beaked waders. The same is the case with the crested bird, probably an Ibis (Ibis comata); but the Lion (handle III, side away from boss), as well as an undetermined felis (handle II, boss side), animals which elsewhere occupy entire rows, play the part of pursuers behind the bulls. (c) The number of rows is variable; but the elements constituting them are not so. If the boss side of the Carnarvon ivory, which has a special character, be excepted, it is found that the species comprised in handles II and III are also possessed by handle I, the most abundantly provided of all (119 + 7 animals on one side and 92 on the other). There are a few exceptions to this statement, but they are of an essentially limited character. The long-maned and short-maned Lions characteristic of handle III are lacking on handles I and II, but on these their place is taken by the Leopard (F. pardus)3. 1 For the translation of M. Benedite's French original we are again indebted to Mr Battiscombe Gunn.-ED. 2 See the tabular analysis, p. 229. 3 The lion appears with all its characteristics only on the Carnarvon handle and on that of the Gebel el-¢Arak knife (Louvre), which are carved on a scale more than double that of ivories I and II.

The Gazelle (G. dorcas), noticeable on handle II, is absent from I, but it is to be noted that it belongs to an abnormal row in which an effort has been made to group various kinds (boss side, 2nd row), and which, from this point of view, it would be worth while to verify on the original. The Crowned Crane (Lady Cecil's Balearica pavonina), which Prof. Petrie's drawing shows on handle II (side away from boss, 2nd row), is difficult to find on handle I, in the row of waders (last but one), but here again verification on the original would not be out of place. (d) The animals represented do not embrace the entire monumental fauna of the Nile Valley, but are circumscribed within a rather limited group. To cite only some of the most usual animals, the handles in question know neither the ass, nor the crocodile, nor the falcon, although these were familiar to the artists of pre- historic times. The animal which I suggest may be the hippopotamus is extremely doubtful. (e) I come now to the fact to which I attach the most importance, because it links up these objects in a far more transparent way: namely, the presence of certain thematic groupings, which will come into play when it falls to us to draw the conclusions of the present investigation. On ivories I and II, the first row of the boss side is formed by Vultures engaged in slashing with their beaks the prey which they hold fast in their talons-a familiar attitude of rapacious birds. Whatever this prey, which eludes our scrutiny, may be, the act and the attitude constitute a recurrent theme, and the foremost place which it occupies on the two handles is not a negligible matter. To this theme is opposed, on the other side, a second no less characteristic: the Elephant trampling on a pair of serpents, the appearance of whose heads sufficiently indicates the naia-haie. Ivory II is not equally conclusive, being much damaged in this region; none the less I maintain the existence here of the same representation. Confirmation of this will be found on a fourth object shortly to be discussed. If we pass on to the second row of the side without boss in I and II, the first of the same side in III, we see new evidence of the thematic character of the decoration. The large- beaked Waders to which, through the necessity of classifying them, the name of Jabiru has been attributed, or, to conform with other opinions, that of the Adjutant-bird1, do not occupy the whole register. The tail of the group is formed by two waders of a different species. But what do we see at its head, on ivories I and III ? We see a Giraffe, inserted behind the leader of the file. This giraffe could not have been lacking on ivory II, unfor- tunately destroyed at this point, since we find it again on the fourth object alluded to above. The importance of the theme is further accentuated by the fact that the leading bird is grappling with an upright Serpent. This may well be the Eryx thebaicus or the E. jaculus, since it has neither the head of the naia nor that of the cerastes, and since it does not coil itself in the manner of the python. This serpent is absent from the Carnarvon Ivory, but appears on the fourth object. 1 Cf. M. A. MURRAY, Saqqarah Mastabas, PI. XXXVII, 21. The three waders which enter into the name --I , skrhbw, i.e., the "b?w "-birds (the souls), have at the articulation of their lower mandibles the caruncles which are quite characteristic of the birds under discussion; but their beaks are far from having the sam-e volume. For the basu (b?w) bird cf. GRIFFITH, Hieroglyphs, fig. 74 and p. 21. 226</page><page sequence="4">THE CARNARVON IVORY (f) The importance of these themes is further emphasized by the fact that, when an ivory has not room to depict them in full, it refrains from omitting them altogether. Thus the serpent-crushing elephant is so essential an element that the Carnarvon ivory, not having the space required to devote an entire row to it, has retained a single example, fitted in with the lions. (g) A certain order is observed in the sequence of the rows. We have just seen that the thematic rows containing the vulture tearing its prey, the serpent-crushing elephant, and the alleged jabirus or adjutant-birds walking in company with the giraffe, have their recognized place in the upper parts. We shall find similarly that the ill-defined animal in which I propose to see provisionally the hippopotamus1 is regularly Fig. i. Ivory Knife-handle in the Pitt-Rivers Museum ("Ivory II"). placed in the lower portion. This may be verified on ivories I (last row but one on both sides) and II (side away from boss, last row); it is absent from the Carnarvon ivory, but not from the fourth object, where it is found again at the very bottom of the representations. (h) Another observation relative to the intentional and systematic character of the decoration is the following: nowhere are two consecutive rows of ruminants or of carnivora to be seen. And this observation, independently of the conclusions to be drawn from it for the collective significance of all these scenes, will help to prevent error in the identification of rows of ill-defined animals. III The analogy seen to exist throughout the representations which we have just analysed has kept in store for us a new surprise. A fourth ivory, devoid of any warlike character, a comb which by a stroke of good fortune has lost nothing but its teeth2, reproduces on its two sides not only the type of representations which forms the subject of this study, 1 Perhaps the hog, Sus libycus. Another hypothesis deserves examination. The animal's rigid tail, its curved snout, and its more or less square ears (see ivory IV), remnind one of the Seth-animal, not indeed such as it appears already in the monuments of the end of the Thinite period (PETRIE, Royal Tombs, vol. II, PIs. XXI, XXII and XXIII passim), nor even at the timne of the Hierakonpolite kings (QUIBELL, Hierakonpolis, P1. XXVI, 1), but before it took on its slim body from the hare or some other animal, and, what is much more remarkable, its snout from the oxyrhynchus-fish. For the Typhonian character of this fish directs attention to its facial similarity with the Seth-quadruped (Wiedemann's alleged okapi), in which I have always seen an imaginary animal. For the rest it is known that on the monuments of the Dynastic period its tail is often nothing but the hieroglyph , connecting with the same idea. This sign also varies with the arrow ' (cf. again QUIBELL, loc. cit.). But upon the proposed hypo- thesis the imaginary animal merely replaced a real one which very early disappeared from the Egyptian horizon, or else subsisted but was unrecognized. 2 These numbered 31; the two ends of the row of teeth are formed, as in our modern combs, by broad "heels." 30-2 227</page><page sequence="5">GEORGES BENEDITE but also the most characteristic of the thematic elements, and these in such a way as to greatly strengthen my comments thereon. This object (Plate XXXIII), which belonged to Mr Theodore M. Davis, hence assumes an importance that could not have been suspected by those who have previously published it'. It is adorned on each side with five rows of animals; of these, three rows on one side are identical as to species with the three corre- sponding rows on the other side. The two others correspond only in so far that the families are identical. The three in which the identity extends to the very species occupy the same places as in the ivories discussed above. FIRST ROW. Three elephants trampling on serpents. Here the reptile is single and has not its throat puffed-0out in the style of the naia, a fact that should warn us against a too strict classification. SECOND ROW. The alleged jabirus (or adjutant-birds) appear, with the serpent standing erect before the leader of the file; the giraffe comes, as was to be expected, immediately behind this first bird, and the heron (Ardea cinerea) duly brings up the rear in accordance with a canon the existence of which needs no further evidence. FIFTH, AND LAST, ROW. The pachyderm with the short and erect tail, the low head, the more or less square ears, and the rounded back, supposed provisionally to be a hippo- potamus, appears in the same place as in ivories I and II. The other two rows quite logically equate the short-maned lion (side A) with the hyaena or hyaena-dog (side B), and the oryx (side A) with the bovid (side B), in such a way that the sum of the species constitutes an average which will exhibit its full import- ance when the number of kindred objects has been augmented. What is striking in this one is the classic-if I may use this term, instead of saying merely logical and normal- character of its decoration. It must have conformed, in its reduced and abridged form, with a model the elements of which are scattered in the objects previously described, and which was characterised, not only by the alternation of ferocious animals with animals either domesticated or capable of domestication, but perhaps also by alternation in the direction of the rows, some moving from left to right, others going the other way. The importance of this orientation is emphasized by the fact that the opposite side (B) presents the inverse arrangement, in such a way that in reality, and without depending upon the spectator's point of view, obverse and reverse correspond as do the two sides, the one visible and the other invisible, of a single animal. The thematic intention of this fourth ivory receives further confirmation from two significant details. The row of lions (side A), reduced, as in the Carnarvon ivory, to three individuals, is terminated by a running dog. In ivory I this animal pursues only the ox and the wild sheep; but in the Carnarvon ivory the animal pursued is certainly a large felis (boss side, first row). The other detail is of such a nature as still more to challenge the ingenuity of modern interpreters: behind the four pachyderms of side A is engraved a five-rayed star, which is found in exactly the same position on handle I. The row of pachyderms being absent from ivory III, it need not surprise us that the star is not to be seen there, for these two elements appear to be closely- connected. On ivory II the row in question is followed by a fish; a correspondence the exact meaning of which we cannot grasp. 1 First published by CAPART, Primitive Art in Egypt, p. 78, from a photograph by E.

It would be very wide of the mark to proceed to detail all the representations of animals which form the essential basis of the decoration of objects coming from the cemeteries of primitive Egypt, whether this decoration be of an accessory nature, or whether it moulds to its own form the object to which it is applied and which then itself takes on the aspect of an animal. We are dealing here with a special case which it is desirable to treat separately, restricting ourselves to relevant comparisons alone. Now the material upon which we can draw is extremely limited. It would perhaps be less so had the important deposit of ivories discovered at Hierakonpolis not stood so ill the test of time; for it is perhaps there, while awaiting further sporadic discoveries such as have given us the four flint-knife handles (including that of the Louvre) and the Davis comb, that we might have been able to gather additional data as to the nature of these represen- tations. The important place taken by ivory in the personal property of the military or religious chiefs of the earliest settled centres of primnitive Egypt is shown in a striking manner by this deposit of objects, which were accumulated in the lowest strata of the temple of the old southern capital'. On this account the bulk of these remains, preserved at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, deserves careful examination. I must necessarily confine myself here to the pieces collected in Mr Quibell's publication. Strictly speaking, not one of them enters into our category. Among them are curved limbs of furniture, in a fragmentary condition; two of them have retained their joining tenons2, and one might be tempted to see in them with Capart3 the arms of arm-chairs; but I am more inclined to look for parts of much more portable objects. The curved staves, one of which has retained its terminal beak4, suggest the idea of the cross-piece of a cithern, an instrument of which I know no example in the Memphite reliefs, and which, apart from the well-known examlple from Tomb 3 at Beni Hasan5, does not occur before the New Kingdom6. But the Asiatic origin of this instrument does not constitute an objection, far from it. To continue with the enumeration: a receptacle carved from a piece of elephant's tusk'7; pieces of veneer which may have belonged to caskets8; a fragment of a spoon-handle9 and a cylinder-seal1lo. On all these objects are found, mixed with others, members of the fauna observed on the handles and the comb, but in quite different conditions. And this is an essential point. A fact on which I cannot lay too much stress is that in cases where there are several superposed rows of animals, dividing lines are found to exist. The animals do not stand on nothing, as in the four objects which form the subject of this study, and to which 1 QUIBELL, Hierakonpolis, Part II, pp. 29-30. 2 Op. cit., P1.

Now with regard to this very ivory last-mentioned I have remarked that the absence of dividing lines was a sign of hyper-archaisml. This must also be taken as a warning that the Hierakonpolis deposit was not forced, archaeologically speaking, to display the types which are to be expected from cemeteries such as those of (Abbadiyeh, Gebel Tarif, and Abu Zeidan, and, in a general way, from the cemeteries of the NekAdeh period. For it is above all in the province of prehistoric archaeology, where the whole apparatus of criteria furnished by writing is lacking, that we must take the strictest account of all the elements of classification. In the second place, although we may observe on one of the Hierakonpolis plaques2 the alternating direction of the registers conforming with the system of the Davis comb, it is far more important to notice that none of the (hitherto published) fragments fromn Hierakonpolis contains the theme of the serpent-crushing elephant, or that of the giraffe strayed among the waders, or the special arrangement giving these latter a rear-guard of another family or sub-family, or the alternation of rows of carnivora and rows of ruminants. It is useless to go beyond these conclusive differences. The only elements which are worthy of comparison are: 1. That which is presented by a curved fragment of ivory3 in which a person whose character is pretty clearly defined by the scene is twice shown quelling the attacks of two of the well-known long-necked panthers; I have already compared him with the hero subduing two lions on the Gebel el-(Arak ivory4. 2. The elephants treading mountains, which occupy the (present) second register of a veneering piece5, and reproduce a theme already known from one of the predynastic or protodynastic statues of Mmn from Petrie's find at Koptos6. It emerges in any case from this comparison that the representations on the three handles I, II and III and the Davis comb correspond to an earlier stage, determined by a complex of dispositions which are not arbitrary, but intentional and deliberate, and which consequently possess a significance that has been forgotten or neglected in the Hierakon- polis ivories, these thus logically constituting a subsequent stage. It cannot be objected against the view taken here that this disposition is peculiar to the handles of daggers, and that as these are absent from the deposit of K6m el-Ahmar the comparison is fundamentally wrong-headed; for the Davis comb comes in very opportunely to dispel this doubt and to establish the fact that the decorative and significant conception revealed by the handles could extend even to toilet articles. We may, therefore, henceforth picture to ourselves a sequence in the animal decoration of prehistoric ivories of which the (provisionally) most remote phase is constituted by the handles and the Davis comb, and the latest phase by the Quibell ivories. Petrie's excavations at Tarkhan offer an inter- mediate stage. I would draw attention to the ivory spoon having a bowl in the shape of a small trough, and the handle surmounted by a couchant animal stated by Petrie to be a 1 B2NEDITE, Le Couteau de Gebel el-¢Arak, p. 29. The only exception among the Hierakonpolis ivories is constituted by fragment 2 with the scorpion (P1. XII). 2 QUIBELL, Hierakonpolis, P1. XII, 1. 3 Op. cit., P1.

IV).</page><page sequence="10">232 GEORGES BENEDITE calf1. All the outer surfaces of the bowl are subdivided into registers, in which alternate rows of panthers and oryxes, i.e., of carnivora and ruminants, are seen; this agrees entirely with the decorative scheme of the four prototype ivories. On the reverse of the bottom surface (P1. XIII, 5) the panthers have given place to dogs. In the last register of sides 1, 2 and 3 the quadrupeds, in spite of their very comnpressed appearance through lack of space, certainly seem to be, not oryxes as one would expect, but hyaenas or hyaena-dogs, animals whose position is always subordinated to that of the felidae in the prototype ivories. On one of the lateral surfaces (P1. XIII, 1), as well as on the small surface forming the anterior side of the trough (P1. XIII, 2), the last feline of the second row has its tail raised. Now this peculiarity has already been pointed out in the two lions which terminate rows 2 and 3 of the Carnarvon ivory. This minute detail again shows the degree of relationship between the Tarkhan ivory and the four others. But, even apart from the question of themes, which does not find any application here, there is a feature in this ivory which we cannot leave out of account-the separation into linear registers, i.e., by means of the ground-line, to which we have attached the importance of a test. By this test we may provisionally assign to this ivory a place intermediate between those forming the subject of this study and the Hierakonpolite series. V From the foregoing considerations it should be possible to deduce the age of this category of objects. The Hierakonpolis material will serve us as a point of departure. The degeneration of the primitive concept which characterises its decoration assigns it a date more recent than that of our handles; and if it be granted that the ivory fragment marked with the name of the Scorpion-king (P1. XII, 2) may be taken as giving the most ancient date of this material, we must then go behind the reign of that king, one of the last pre-Menite rulers. When studying the Gebel el-¢Arak knife-handle I arrived2 at the conclusion that this object was contemporary with that stage of the pre-Menite period corresponding with S.D. 60 of Petrie's classification. Since the publication of my essay the learned University College professor has devoted an important article to the same ivory in his Egyptological journal Ancieit Egypt3. On a certain number of points his views are much more definite than my own; on others I regret to see that our opinions differ. But what is of capital importance for my point of view is that we are in agreement in regard to the date of the object, which he assigns to the climax of the second pre-Menite civilisation. Commencing with the study of the palettes, which I divided into three groups: A, the protodynastic group, dated by a royal name; B, the predynastic group, thrown by its characters back to the other extremity of the classification; and C, the intermediate group, dividing only imperfectly these two extremes, I endeavoured (this resume is limited to our present subject) to determine as strictly as possible the specific characters of group B, which comprises the Palette of the Hunt, the fragmnents of which are shared between the 1 W.

On these the outlines of human beings and animals present certain technical peculiarities which are more or less absent from the other two groups, and to which I have attached the value of tests of hyper-archaism. Succinctly enumerated, these are: the geometrical form of the eyes, the summary treatment of torsos, the absence of protuberance in the knees, the hatchet-shape given to the human feet, the flexion-wrinkles on the quadrupeds' shoulders, the hypogastric prolongation of the lion's mane,arrangement of claws like the arrangement of claws like the teeth of a comb on the paws of wild animals, the preponderance of exaggerated detail, and the absence of any conventional sign to represent earth or water so that living beings and boats rest on nothing. These characters agree to an appreciable degree with those of the representations on the Gebel el-Arak handle. Prof. Petrie regards the palettes as a later product of the same artistic school as that to which the handle belongs, in the sense that the roughest and mnost archaic of them (my group B) would correspond to handles I (Brooklyn Museum) and II (Ashmolean Museum), which the English savant attributes4 to a period of decadence in comparison with the Louvre handle. We stand now at the most delicate point in the problem, I might say at the parting of two roads which do not necessarily lead to the same conclusions. One of these roads is constituted by considerations of technique other balone, the other by the evolutional characters of the representations-these being provisionally considered quite separately from the signifi- cation of the representations. In comparing a barbarous form with a fully developed artistic one, we are sufficiently well situated to-day not to confuse the barbarism of decadence with that of primitive culture, when periods and monuments are concerned with whose general history we are acquainted. Only an unpractised eye could fail to discern wherein the archaism of the Mediterranean countries in the seventh century before our era differs from the barbarism of the same countries in the seventh century of that era. An art which is seeking itself has not the same physiognomy for the expert as an art which is losing itself. If we transport ourselves to the remote epochs of pre-history the distinction is far less obvious, for we do not possess objects enough to enable us to follow step by step the evolution or the degeneration of forms. Another obstacle of which the fullest account must be taken is differences of scale in the representations classified. The engraver who had to fit 119 figures into a surface with maximum measurements of 92 x 60 mm., and who had less than one square centimetre at his disposal for each figure, could not obtain the same result as the maker of the Gebel el-&lt;Arak knife, who put two or three figures side by side on an area which the other would have made to hold two or three rows of five or six figures each. The same argument applies to handle II, which has moreover suffered by mutilation. To my mind the opinion to be formed on handles I and II must be subordinated to that which results from the examination of ivories III and IV., i.e., the Carnarvon ivory and the Davis comb, in which the dimensions of the figures are approximately the same as in the Louvre ivory. No prolonged examination is necessary for the discovery that the execution of the 1 No. 20,790. 2 The Louvre fragment has the inventory number E. 11254. 3 I will not deal here with the already copious bibliography of the problem of the palettes, but will merely refer the Entglish reader to Mr F.

The engraver of the handle has rendered it with remarkable realism and exactitude. The profile of the -- sloping brow, emphasising the smallness of the head (a feature of the African elephant), the rendering of the ears, the flexi- bility of which is indicated by parallel furrows, the anatomy of the legs, the prominence of the iliac bone near the rump, and in general the rightness of the proportions, render this figure very nearly worthy of a place beside the animals of ~-~? =-' ~~~ '-~~-'~- ' ~~ ^the Louvre handle. It would be very difficult to apply this Fig. 2. description to the six elephants of the Davis comb, which are quite rudimentary. But which of the two representations preceded the other? If it were possible to settle this point we should have the basis for a classification, for the comb is singularly closely related by its style to ivories I and II, while the Carnarvon ivory has an unmis- takeable family likeness to the Louvre ivory. Thus, according as the Carnarvon ivory be assumed to be earlier or later than the Davis comb, the conclusion will be arrived at that the Gebel el-eArak ivory is earlier (as Prof. Petrie considers) or later than the Brooklyn and Ashmolean Museum ivories. It must be realised that this problem cannot be solved merely by analysis of the forms, without knowledge of the intermediate links. My habits of thinking, if I gave them full play, would lead me to lay great stress on certain elements which favour the priority of the comb. The childish exaggeration of detail, out of proportion with the scale of the figures, agrees satisfactorily with this thesis. What is certain is that these two objects, even if they are quite contemporary, do not come froni the same workshop, still less from the same hand. The one testifies to an intimate know- ledge of animal life and reproduces it with dexterity; the other merely repeats, with the perfunctoriness of a bad workmanl, an exceedingly primitive model consecrated by custom. We shall arrive at a result more satisfying to logic if we follow the other road, and examine the evolutional characters of the representations. For this, the flat side of the Carnarvon handle must be compared with the two sides of the comb. At first sight we are apprised by their similarities and differences that both hark back to one prototype from which they are more or less removed. At this point handles I and II should be brought into play. Handle I especially claims our attention wvith its twenty rows of animals (ten on each side) as being, among the objects at present known, the one which stands nearest to the prototype, even granting that it does not reproduce the latter exactly. Everything in it is subordinated to the necessity of making an entirely unabridged representation. The few figures on it which are not shown in rows, but which are represented by one or two individuals, are similarly treated on all the handles. These are the cases of the giraffe, the two last waders, the dog, the fishes, and lastly the star. The same cannot be said of the Carnarvon Ivory. Although it reproduces the giraffe and the two last waders in the conditions already noted, it arbitrarily employs the same method with the elephant, which on the three other ivories occurs in a complete series. This is already a sign of more recent date. We shall find other such signs. The primitive conception, such as it may be deduced from handle I, involves at least twenty rows of animals. If the tabular analysis (p. 229) be consulted, it will be seen that 234</page><page sequence="13">Plate XXXIV Obverse Reverse IVORY KNIFE-HANDLE IN THE BROOKLYN MUSEUM ("IVORY I") Reproduced from a cast</page><page sequence="14">THE CARNARVON IVORY 235 although certain species are met with on both sides, only one of them-Bos taurus- occupies two rows on the same side. This is intentional, and we shall seek its meaning later on; but what seems certain is that we have here a scheme which is thought out and is far from being merely arbitrary. For the 10 + 10 rows of ivory I, ivory II can show only 7 + 6 and ivory IV (the comb) 5 + 5. These two objects are thus less complete than ivory I. Is the most elaborate one that which is the most representative of the prototype, or is it, on the contrary, that which by reason of its complexity must correspond to the latest evolutional stage ? We should be led to adopt this latter conclusion if the ivories with fewer rows showed signs of indecision, of groping, of divergences in the choice of animals, and in the order of the rows; but, as we shall shortly see, there is, on the contrary, a close relationship between all these representations. They appear to conform to the same rules, to be derived from the same conception, and what is more, from a very definite conception. Thus, with regard to the order in which the elements occur, the serpent-crushing elephant regularly occupies the uppermost row in I, II and IV, the series of wader-birds accompanied by the giraffe occupies the second row in these same ivories, in which also the following row is allotted to beasts of prey. After the beasts of prey comes a row of ruminants. It is only after this point that differences appear in the ivories, arising from the number of rows. To trace the parallelism further, it is necessary to refer to the lowest portions which show the row of the pachyderms walking with tail erect. The rows which are absent from the two defective ivories are occupied in ivory I by alternate rows of ruminants and of quadrupeds which it is at present impossible to identify on account of the smallness of the scale and because they lack the most certain descriptive feature, namely the horns. They certainly reproduce the rhythm of alternating carnivora and ruminants, for this is a fundamental rule upon which the decorative scheme of these objects rests; but it is important to note that they have a very distinctly intentional character of their own, and are not put in merely to fill out the spaces. We thus have before us a homogeneous, unique decorative theme, shown in its full form in ivory I, and in abridged forms, in epitome, in ivories II and IV-this apart from any question of the exact moment of their execution; for there is no reason, on this ground, why they should not have been altogether contemporary, just as in later times two religious or funerary texts, the one an abridgment of the other, may be simultaneous products of the same guild of scribes. I will not say the same of the Carnarvon ivory (III). The physiognomy of this handle contrasts with that of the two others not only on account of the scale of the figures, involving an arbitrary reduction of the scheme, which ignores, whether by design or not, several elements essential to the other ivories, but also because it does not faithfully observe the order of the rows, giving the waders precedence over the elephant, which is reduced to a single figure and is thus doubly degraded. Another difference which is still more important is that only the side of the handle without boss is devoted to this theme, the other, the boss side-and this emphasises its relationship with the Gebel el-CArak ivory- being reserved for a pictorial scene of animals in the desert, needing only the huntsman, as in certain palettes, for us to describe it as a hunting scene. The degeneration of the processional theme of animals thus in itself stamps this handle, and consequently its congener from Gebel el-¢Arak, as being of later date. My conclusions may be resumed thus: Ivories I, II and IV, that is to say the Brooklyn and Pitt-Rivers handles and the Davis comb, must be regarded as belonging to 31-2</page><page sequence="15">GEORGES BENEDITE a rather more remote antiquity than the two fine ivories belonging to the Louvre and to Lord Carnarvon, while remaining strictly within the limits of the same cultural cycle, that called by Petrie the " Second Civilisation." VI We now come to the most debatable part of our subject: the interpretation of the scenes which have been described at length and of which I have attempted to trace the genesis. And first, what purpose is to be attributed to the adoption of this decorative system, which arranges animals in parallel friezes, and of which the key-note is repetition ? Is the repetition a process having a purely aesthetic reference ? Is it in its origin a fact of an artistic order ? One would be tempted to believe this, did there not clearly emerge another and still more fundamental idea: the idea of plurality. The intention would seem to have been to represent the whole species and not the individual-an idea which has not escaped Prof. Petrie, and which may be resumed in this other formula: unity in plurality, and conversely, plurality in unity. The species is dealt with as a single individual in numerous manifestations'. We may thus regard the representations in question as more or less complete lists of species. The proof of this may be seen notably in the elephant of the Carnarvon ivory, who by himself is as representative of the species as are his six or eight brethren of the other ivories. But, when this has been said, what is the purpose of these lists ? It is of prime importance to consider what could have been the relations subsisting between the animal world and the first inhabitants of the Nile Valley, what place the former held in the mind of primitive Egypt. Now, the further we penetrate into that remote past, with the help of the fairly numnerous remains which have come down to us, the more we are struck by the preponderant place which the animnal world occupied therein. It becomes evident that the barbarian who made the first attempts at organised life on a hospitable soil was continually dominated by all the feelings evoked in him by his joint existence with the rest of the animal kingdom. In these creatures, living and active like himself, he saw the extension of living and active nature, that is to say, of a world not distinct froni his own. And this conception, which was originally closely intermingled with those of animism and fetishism which attributed conscious life to inanimrnate objects, gradually separated itself therefrom. Whatever one may say, the inert fetishes which had a place in the most primitive beliefs of Egypt did not preserve the very high degree of human character conferred on animals; they never attained to an absolute anthropomorphism from which all the logical conclusions were drawn; they never possessed a life fully modelled on that of human beings. This is manifest, and if any one doubts it he need only turn to the pictures drawn over and over again by the primitive Egyptians to see how few of these deal with objects or forms other than those of animals. We can thus infer the existence of a whole series of manifestations dealing with the animal world, and may expect to find these intimately mingled with all the childish speculations of primitive thought. A glance at the tabular analysis will show that the animal kingdom does not enter into our investigations as a whole; we have before us a selection. How has this selection been arrived at? Hypotheses will vary according as we consider the facts regarding animals 1 W. M. F. PETRIE, Animal Worship in Egypt, in Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, vol. xxvi (1904), p. 113.

FRAZER, Totemism, p. 3 (cited by Petrie). 236</page><page sequence="16">THE CARNARVON IVORY 237 apart from humanity, or the facts as to the relations which may then have subsisted between animals and men. In the first case we must assume the existence of traditional legends taking the form of stories, of apologues, of folk-songs, of everything, in fact, which goes to make up the oral life of the nomad, and was, consequently, sufficiently well-known to be evoked by a childish superposition of figures, without even any attempt at pictographic story-telling'. But this is a hypothesis without support, for we are still almost completely ignorant of the lowest strata of Egyptian folklore. That this people had a very lively taste for making animals act like men is proved, apart from any mythological allusions, by the well-known satyric drawings. Further, the Oxford palette humanizes an animal of the dog family, and this figure may well prepare us for other discoveries; but in the interpretation of the scene under discussion we need not embrace this theory to the exclusion of any other, and nothing prevents us from turning to hypotheses regarding animals in their relations with humanity. That these reliefs engraved on portable objects are to be regarded as a methodical employment of imitative magic with a view to obtaining, for example, the multiplication of cattle, of game-especially if it be borne in mind that the knife was a hunting and perhaps also a sacrificial weapon, and that the beasts of prey opposed to the ruminants might (magically) become the hunter's coadjutors: this is a theory which will readily find credence in certain minds. Nevertheless I mention it only to reject it, for if that had been the ruling idea it would not have involved a traditional order in the arrangement of the figures. Its method would have been quite different; in any case the thematic combinations which have been reviewed would not have entered into it. A list of totem animals (set side by side, possibly, with animals devoid of that character) would show greater variety, and would hardly admit of the curtailments to which the decorator has readily reconciled himself. Nevertheless, I must say that I believe this hypothesis brings us nearer to our goal. The persistence of the same order in the rows is a fact of capital importance. It refers either to a succession in time (on the hypothesis, which we have abandoned, of a folk-tale theme), or to a succession in space (on the hypothesis of a list of totems) pre- senting itself to us as a geographical index. Can the latter view be justified ? We must first of all abandon the expectation of systematically tracing back the religious geography of Pharaonic Egypt to such a remote period. But if we found that some of these data tallied with certain geographical emblems in the monumental lists we should already have a decisive result. Now we find that on one side the elephant, and on the other the vulture, have the first place. How is this precedence to be explained ? The elephant has not been preserved to us among the standards of the geographical lists, nor even among any of the religious emblems carried in processions. It is absent from Egyptian mythology, but has left its trace in the name of the capital of the first nome of Upper Egypt, and, what is equally evidential in such a case, it figures among the standards set up on the boats decorating vases coeval with the objects which form the subject of this article. It thus constitutes one of the most ancient geographical entities, and there is no valid reason why the strandard of the Nekadeh vases should not refer to the filture Elephantine region of the dynastic period2. The vulture is the bird of the goddess Nekhebt, L j |, and l I should certainly assign this character to the subject represented on the small Hierakonpolis palette now at the Ashmolean Museum. 2 H. BRUGSCH, Dictionnaire Geographique, p. 110. The elephant as determinative figures in the texts</page><page sequence="17">GEORGES BENEDITE consequently corresponds to the capital of the third nome, whose primordial r6le in the times immediately preceding Menes cannot now be recovered. These two first rows are thus connected with the southernmost region of Egypt. This is a result which seems to me satisfactory. But how shall we group all the rows which follow, in relation to these first two? In which part or parts of Egypt are they to be placed ? Admitting that we have a point of departure corresponding to the region comprised between Elephantine and Eileithyia- polis, can we descend the Nile and methodically distribute each of the rows in the order of the principalities which pretty early formed the framework of the political geography of ancient Egypt ? One of the first objections is that arising from the absence of the Horus-falcon; but it loses its force if the fact be taken into account that the Horus-falcon is intinately connected with the invasion which, several centuries before culminating in the constitution of a single monarchy (materialised by the Egyptian annalists into the perhaps imaginary reign of Menes), succeeded in amalgamating all the small barbarous states of Upper Egypt into a first monarchical group that a persistent tradition represents to us as having been opposed to an analogous group in Northern Egypt under the sovereignty of the Serpent principality, Pe-Wazt (Bouto). It suffices then to assume that our ivories take us back to far more ancient times for the absence of the Horus-falcon to be explained, an explanation which finds further support in what has been said of the later date of the Hierakonpolis ivories. This having been noted, it will be observed that generally speaking the animals which find a place in the series of ivories having an ornamental parallel arrangement of figures are among those found in the political and religious symbols of later times: the lion, the canidae, the oryx, the the hippopotamus(?),the ibis, the heroram, th o this ()the ibisn, the heron, the Lepidots, and finally the elephant and the vulture, whose cases have been settled. For the hypothesis discussed here to be tenable, it is necessary to start out from a certain number of premises, which may be set forth as follows: 1. The warlike clans represented by their totem-animals do not necessarily correspond to the first principalities which contributed to the formation of one or other of the two great divisions of Egypt. 2. An uncertain number of these clans, perhaps even the greater number of them, did not, at the outset of their occupation of the Nile Valley, occupy a settled position, and in course of time were obliged to shift their places before reaching their final seats. 3. Some of them lost their independence by absorption or by complete destruction, and it is reasonable to believe that only a minority had at the dawn of the historic period attained sufficient strength and cohesion to constitute the forty-odd small states destined to become the future regional divisions of dynastic Egypt-and that only after numerous transformations. 4. The further we plunge into the remote depths of this pre-history, the more we must expect to find on its scanty monuments only local data of rather limited range. of the Old Kingdom; cf., for example, the inscription of Uni, 1. 42, which settles, for that period and after, the meaning of . Cf. also SETHE, Pyrarmidentexte, §§ 864 b, c, 1116 b. 1 The repetition of the row of bovids favours this hypothesis. The bull is one of the animals which occur most frequently on the political and religious standards. 238</page><page sequence="18">THE CARNARVON IVORY 5. In correlation with these positive or negative facts we shall not expect to find on these same monumlents any rudiments of hieroglyphic writing, nor yet the form of the bracket- or perch-standard, which does not figure on the vases of the Nekadeh period and appears first on the palettes of series A and the mace-heads contemporary with the last pre-Menite kings. Its origin appears to me to be bound up with the cult of the Horus-falcon, of which it was logically the support. In his cs primitive sanctuary the living totem was held by a leash to a perch- stand, which gave its form to the support of the standard, so much so that the bird's food-trough and the meat which this contained persisted in the hieroglyphic form of the object (see the accompanying cut). And Fig. 3. when the Horus-falcon, the Falco peregrinus, extended his sovereignty over the other totems he influenced thenm in various ways, of which the most singular of all was certainly the causing the images of large quadrupeds to be mounted on his bird's perch-stand: a fact which proves, contrary to the opinion of Diodorus, that there were originally real animals which were ancestors and gods of the clans, and not mere distinctive effigies serving the purpose of standards. The living animal preceded, and did not follow the standard 1. These conditions are satisfied by our series of ivories, and I recognize that a reasoned and robust faith in their hyper-archaism is necessary to deny beforehand the possibility of a single one turning up which would negative this thesis by characteristics peculiar to the ivories of the Thinite epoch, or even of the period immediately previous. Did the five-rayed star, which is absent from the Carnarvon ivory, but which, in view of its connection with the register of pachyderms, ivory II apparently contained, likewise have the value of a totem? Up to the present it has not been found on any of the prehistoric standards, where its existence would not be more surprising than that of the solar disk (no. 17 of Loret's list, op. cit., p. 76). We are naturally inclined to consider it the representation of Sirius. But in that case it may be doubted whether it would not be just as logical to leave it its astral significance; and at once one sees the use which the adepts in astrological interpretations could make of this for the general significance of the 1 Appearances support Diodorus (Bibl. Ilist. i, 36), and also M. Victor Loret, who, more guarded in an earlier work, Les enseignes militaires des tribus, in Revue Egyptologique, 1902, has developed the position of Diodorus in Quelques idees sur la forme primitive etc. in Revue Egyptologique, 1904; for on the monuments of the oldest period the standard supporting the totem is nothing more than a pike, with or without the embellishment of a feather and two streamers. But reflexion will make it clear that what is secondary is not the perch-stand but merely the idea of making it the theme of the support of the standard, the adaptation to its form of that of the primitive pike. Logic demands that the totem-falcon, the ancestor and god of the clan, should have been in persona proprid the object of a regular cult at the same time that its image served as the emblem and distinctive token of this same clan. On the other hand nothing is more likely than that the tachygraphic reproduction of this standard, with its feedinlg-trough of plaited work (papyrus or palm-leaf stalk) should have become, as M. Loret has shown, the ordinary god- hieroglyph. It seems to me that the proposition should be formulated thus: the emblematic stand supporting the Horus-falcon became, in the Thinite period and after, i.e., in the newly unified Egypt, the sign used to designate the gods. The bird which surmounted it might be removed from it; from this resulted the doublet ~ and ', having exactly the same significance, whether as determinatives of god- names or in the formula J - = j| =|]] Thus it was the graphic expression of the gods, and not the gods themselves, that originated from the standard of Horus. 239</page><page sequence="19">GEORGES BENEDITE picture, which would be transported from the earth to the sky, the zones of animals being thus transformed into constellations. Before adopting this standpoint let us wait until we come upon further ivories with more convincing marks of their celestial character. Let us not forget that Sirius has the function of genreratrix of the new year, and might very well denote the date of the feast in which the votive weapon was consecrated. But this is merely one of the views suggested by its special and, so to speak, sacramental position in these representations. I prefer to confess that this sign adds one more enigma to these mysterious ivories. I come, in conclusion, to two difficulties which are not solved by the geographical hypothesis. (a) In contrast with the standards found on the vases of the Nekadeh period, no sign foreign to the animal kingdom (except the star) appears on the ivories; the presenlce of the sign of Min, - ) 1, of the tree, or of the branch, would have been particularly convincing, while on the other hand their absence opens the door to doubt. (b) The systematic alternation of carnivora and ruminants seem to defy any geographical inter- pretation. An answer is possible. It is sufficiently evident that the weapon is as much a hunting-weapon as an instrument of sacrifice; this is clear from the Carnarvon ivory. The boss side of the latter accords completely with the conception of the Gebel el-CArak handle (same side). A sort of jeu d'esprit, the most obvious manifestation of which is the enrolment of the giraffe in the band of long-necked wader-birds, and in which I am inclined to see the most ancient specimen of satiric humour that Egypt has bequeathed us, presided over the sorting of the totem-animals into hunting beasts and hunted beasts. I find this contrast again in the themes of the elephant and the bird leading the file, both of which are at grips with serpents. This view would thus make due allowance for so much as is systematic in the choice and the persistence of the order of species adopted, as well as for the constant alternation of animals of prey and ruminants2. Such a conception implies an artistic preoccupation. But what object, even the most rudimentary, of the remotest periods of human life on the banks of the Nile, does not bear witness to the marvellous gift to which Egypt chiefly owes her place in the history of civilisation ? In these ivories the artistic and technical qualities most suited to the material are displayed as much as in similar works of the best periods. Such are the ideas which appear to me to govern this type of decoration, which passed from the handles of knives to the comnbs of warriors, and the model of which was so completely successful that it determined a style whence issued perhaps the whole animal decoration of ivory objects during a period that eludes computation. These ideas may be resumed thus: the totem-animals of more or less adjacent clans, and even of internal subdivisions of the clan (family groupings)3, are assembled in a pictorial manner having I Is this indeed the primitive form of &lt; ? Cf. the determinatives of the word ' IQ jJ --4 in Pyramid Texts (Sethe's edition) § 1212 c. 2 The special and intentional character of the additional row of oxen (a geographical characteristic) should not be overlooked. 3 We know nothing of the personal proper names of those remote times, but that animals' names may have been borne by men must be admitted. The potters' marks, PETRIE, iVaqada and Ballas, P1. LI, Diospolis Parva, PI.

Independently of the animals which the traditions of later ages have preserved to us in the geographical system or in the lists of sacred animals, we can perhaps find in these the most ancient trace of mystical expressions which play a great part in the mythological, religious and funerary texts of all periods. Our thoughts turn immediately to those % % which have been so much discussed, and to those %% 15j of the mythic fjhO (Heliopolis) which appear constantly in the religious texts together with the i i i or 1 of ~ (Pe) and of ® (Nekhen), and which are likewise attributed to the dead king and consequently to all dead persons. However it may be with these hypotheses-those which I have rejected as well as that which I have felt obliged to adopt-the fact remains that we have before us objects with a systematic and expressive decoration, the first attempt discerned by us to note down and commemorate facts before the arrival of writing. There is much more in them than in the magical or reputed magical representations of animals in the caverns of the palaeolithic age, from which any system is entirely absent. And nothing equally definite exists, to my mind, in the decoration of the earthenware vases of the Nekadeh period, although so great efforts have been made to interpret them2. These ivories thus form at present the earliest known manifestation of human thought before the first embryonic texts. This consideration alone shows how great is the importance of this category of monuments. 1 The theme of the three birds, already vested with a mystical purport, appears on a certain number of objects of the Thinite period. Cf. QUIBELL, Archaic Objects (Catalogue General dut Musee du Caire), nos. 11898, 11900, 11904 (P1. 37), and 11976 (P1. 40), 11978, from the royal tomb of Nekadeh. The examples given by J. DE MORGAN, Origines de l'Egypte, vol. II, figs. 517 and 557, have the same provenance. See also PETRIE, Royal Tombs, vol. I, P1. XII, no. 1, and ibid., vol. II, P1. XV, no. 113. The triple form is merely the mark of the plural, and might be expressed, in the decoration of a vase, by a whole row of birds. 2 Cf. G.
