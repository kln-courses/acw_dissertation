<plain_text><page sequence="1">Associative Context and Joke Visualization TIMOTHY CORRIGAN CORRELL This paper uses a behavioral approach to help understand how joking evokes, embodies, and expresses the esoteric experiences of individuals and small groups.' To get at such processes, joking must be investigated in its larger contextual framework. Robert Georges's call for a holistic rather than atomistic approach to storytelling events is a guiding principle here (Georges 1969). Following Georges's model, I study jokes, which are so often presented as texts apart from context and texture, as part of larger events which include the facial expressions, laughter, conversation, asso- ciations, and so on which fall before, after, and simultaneous to the telling of ajoke. In this paper I will examine how the conceptualization and meaning of jokes vary as tellers and audience members negotiate and reformulate humorous texts. I argue that during humorous exchanges, jokes become laden with multifarious associations based upon both the shared and idiosyncratic experiences of tellers and audiences, and that some of these associations may be gleaned for consideration by the researcher. I will first discuss how the associative contextualization that occurs when jokes are told is shared in groups; I will then describe the asso- ciations various joke tellers have regarding jokes in their repertoire; finally, I will explore the process of joke visualization and associative con- textualization that occurs when individuals experience jokes for the first time. Henry Glassie's remarks about context and stories in Passing the Time in Ballymenone are applicable to jokes and joking sessions: "As I began to think about stories," Glassie says, "life began to arrange itself around them as con- text." In defining context, he remarks that: Some of the context is drawn from the immediate situation, but more is drawn from memory. It is present, but invisible, inaudible. Contexts are mental associations woven around the text during performance to shape and complete them, to give them meaning (1982: 33). Meaning, which Glassie sees as "that which joins people through things," Western Folklore 56 (Summer/Fall, 1997):317-30 317</page><page sequence="2">318 WESTERN FOLKLORE is something which "logically links intention and response, then expands through private associations to join all a thing is with all it can be in the minds of its creators and perceivers" (Glassie 1982:33). As Donald Braid points out in outlining his concept of "experiential meaning," there is a "recontextualization of the narrative imagery and events in terms of the lis- teners' own life experience.... [P]ast experience-'what has gone on before'-is...an essential resource in making sense of present experi- ence....Familiar images from our own experience are used to fill in...gaps" (1996:15, 19). The associative contextualization that occurs when jokes are told is expe- rienced and shared on different levels. In some cases, associations are shared verbally when other jokes, stories, and reminiscences are brought to mind and then recited. For example, during one induced joking session that I tape-recorded, I started to recite a joke about two "bums" who mistake a "piece of shit" for a candy bar. I was interrupted after the first sentence by my friend, who declared emphatically, "Oh yeah that's an old one....My brother tells these kinds ofjokes....Oh, that goes way back, fifth grade" (2 February 1996). At this point another individual present began to laugh. These exclamations communicated an associative glee harking back to childhood, which evoked laughter from others present. The joke was temporarily cut short-although I did go on to finish it. However, it had become a vehicle through which others shared in this individual's child- hood and family experiences. The associative context, in this case verbally shared, added intimate meaning to the joke. In another joking session, an individual responded to several jokes about religious figures and sex by telling his own dirty/religious jokes. His jokes were met with groans, at which point he tried to disavow responsibility for the coarseness of them by saying, "I haven't told them since I heard them in fifth grade." This com- ment, the context in which he learned the jokes, and the thought of chil- dren telling such jokes, caused an outburst of laughter; more laughter, in fact, than the jokes themselves (26 February 1996). As noted above, jokes may also elicit topically related jokes or narratives about personal experiences. For example, in one joking session in which I participated, an individual told the joke, "One guy asks the other guy, 'Do you fast on Yom Kippur?' 'Yeah, between one bite and the next."' A second person responded by talking about a woman she had worked with as a lab technician: She lived with this guy who was a Muslim. It was so funny, because when he had friends over he'd pray five times a day. He always said he prayed five times a day, but she said, "I could hear him through</page><page sequence="3">ASSOCIATIVE CONTEXT 319 the wall. Oh no, he only does it when his friends are there, otherwise he sleeps all night [laughter]." [2 February 1996] The man in the joke flaunts the conventions of religious stricture; the man of the story falsely pretends to adhere to them. During the same joking ses- sion, a joke in which a waiter tells a man that bull's balls are on the menu caused a humorous discussion about eating unusual foodstuffs. For instance, "I've heard plenty of jokes about bull's balls, but I've never really heard of anyone eating them." In some cases, associations may remain unarticulated even though they might be mutually experienced. For example, the following joke was occasioned by the nearness of a graveyard: "Do you know why there is a wall around that place? People are dying to get in there." The individual I collected this joke from told me that whenever she and other family mem- bers passed a graveyard they recited this joke. Originally, family members had repeatedly heard this joke performed by their grandfather. He has now passed on, yet they still tell the joke amongst themselves and to others. With the joke text alone, we may examine the mechanics of its humor, such as the double meaning of the.word "dying," which implies that entry into the graveyard is a desired state. However, we can gain a more complete understanding of the joke's esoteric meaning and function given the associative contextualization of the joke as experienced by family members. Externally, the context of the joke involves the graveyard and the inter- action involved in the sharing of the joke. On an associative level, there are memories and emotions related to the family's grandfather. Thus each telling reminds family members of the past, and a metonymic chain is established in which family members reshare the experience of joking with their grandfather. The fact that the grandfather has died and gone into the graveyard himself adds a layer of meaning to this family's use of the joke. As Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett notes, "Repertoires, whether of songs, tales, or other expressive forms, are examples of accumulations made over a lifetime. Their powers of evocation derive from the associa- tions that accumulate with them" (1989:329). As seen with the graveyard riddle, joking may be triggered by inciden- tal occurrences. For instance, I asked one friend about the last time she had told the following joke which I had collected from her: "What's grosser than gross? Eating your Corn Flakes and finding out your brother is saving his scab collection." She told me that recently her sister was visiting and was eating some muesli, so she told her this riddle-joke and accom- plished the intended effect of grossing her out. They then shared mem- ories of childhood, when they had first told this joke. The same informant</page><page sequence="4">320 WESTERN FOLKLORE pointed out to me that as kids, whenever they saw a mayonnaise com- mercial, they would break into fits of laughter and disgust due to a joke that they shared previously which involved mayonnaise and pus. In such sit- uations, joking associations inform the ways people react to unfolding events. These kinds of associative responses must be gleaned from joke tellers and their audiences through observation and interviews, with such ques- tions as: "What made you tell this joke?"; "What immediately came to mind when you saw, heard, or told this joke?"; "Did you visualize, hear, or smell anything?"; "Did it make you think of any personal experiences or images?"; "Why do you think this joke is funny or not, either personally or to others?". These types of questions were generated with the intention of eliciting the ways that cognitive reactions to the same joke may vary from individ- ual to individual. In the winter of 1996 I conducted a modest investigation into the associative contextualization of joking by querying persons about jokes that they performed in my presence, or by telling various individu- als jokes and then posing these kinds of questions to them.2 I found that I sometimes had to coax information out of some of the informants. At first, some informants would not verbalize the entirety of details they experienced. For instance, when I interviewed one person about her response to the joke: Did you hear about the Italian woman who was knitting a sweater? She ran out of yarn and had to use spaghetti to finish it. Well, the first time she wore it out, two meatballs chased her home. Interviewer: What did you visualize? Agnes: What did I visualize? [laughing] Two meatballs rolling after heron the way home. Big meatballs, human-sized meatballs. Inter- viewer: Did you visualize the Italian woman at all? Agnes: Yeah, knitting a sweater. Then I visualized the two meat- balls following her, waving strands of spaghetti or something like that. Interviewer: What did you envision the woman looking like? Agnes: She had black hair in a bun. 'Cause she is knitting. Inter- viewer: Was she any age? Agnes: Middle-aged. Interviewer: Did she have a face? Agnes: No. In such cases I wondered if I was capturing visualization, or merely creating it by asking questions. Yet I am convinced that I was capturing the expe-</page><page sequence="5">ASSOCIATIVE CONTEXT 321 rience of visualization, because I frequently asked informants, "You imag- ined this as the joke unfolded? You're not imagining this now?" and they inevitably gave me an affirmative answer in reply. The fact that informants would articulate only part of their experience in answer to the first ques- tion I asked indicates that symbolic weight or special significance should be attributed to their initial reaction: that is, if someone responds by talking only about the meatballs at first, then it may be argued that the meatballs assume a position of primacy in the informant's thought processes. This method of testing is problematic. When asking these kinds ques- tions about several jokes in a row, the responses may be primed by the ini- tial series of questions. Simply indicating that you are going to tell the informant ajoke and then ask them a series of questions may color their responses. Ideally, a single joke should be recited, then questions should be administered to gauge responses. Individuals might be interviewed just after reciting or hearing ajoke in a natural context. For the sake of cap- turing a large number of responses at once, a joke and the subsequent series of questions could be administered to a classroom or other type of gathering. Responses to my questions about several spoken and pictorial jokes var- ied considerably. In some cases, individuals indicated that very little visu- alization of the jokes occurred. However, in most cases informants were surprised at the amount of detail that they actually had envisioned. In all cases, informants drew on images and personal experiences from their past in order to cognize the unfolding jokes. When discussing visualization and associative responses to jokes, it should be noted that those who tell a specific joke or those who have heard the joke before are likely to have a set of reoccurring visual images or asso- ciations that accompany that particular joke. Their experiences should be distinguished from the experiences of listeners who are hearing the joke for the first time. In the cases where individuals are re-experiencing jokes or narratives that are familiar to them, associations and visualization may inform reactions or performance. As Robert Georges notes: Since we perceptualize the experience or event that is the source and subject of our narrating both before and during the time we are sym- bolizing it for our listeners through sound and movement, our reaction to what we perceptualize sometimes results in responses that manifest themselves overtly in behaviors (1979:105). The effects of perceptualization on performance may range from more oblique behaviors such as sighing or smiling to shifting voice inflection for</page><page sequence="6">322 WESTERN FOLKLORE different characters, elaboration of descriptions, and so on. A. B. Lord, for instance, provides a good example of how narrative visualization may influence performance. Referring to the embellishment of descriptive details employed by one singer in his recitation, Lord states, "He told me once that he 'saw in his mind every piece of trapping which he put on a horse.' He visualized the scene or the action, and from that mental image he formed a verbal reflection in his song" (1956:125). Indeed, associations experienced in relationship to a narrative may influ- ence subsequent retellings in which the story is consciously altered. The fol- lowing joke, for example, was collected on July 20, 1996 from an African American narrator who performs jokes for money in Venice Beach, Cali- fornia: This old white lady goes into the gun shop. She says "I want to buy a pistol so I can shoot some cans." So being an old white lady, the clerk shows her a twenty-two marksman, you know. She says, "I don't want that, I want that forty-four magnum down there." The clerk says, "Lady that's the most powerful handgun in the world. What kind of cans are you planning on shooting?" She said, "Some Puerto Ri-cans, some Afri-cans, some Mexi-cans." About a month later on August 25, I recorded another rendition of the joke from the same narrator. It had been transformed, however, by the teller who asked me if I had heard his "Granny Clampet joke." He had replaced the generalized figure of "the old white lady" with "Granny Clampet," a humorous, ornery character from a program called The Bev- erly Hillbillies. He had also added "Republi-cans" to her list of targets. When I asked him why he had altered the joke, he told me that the old lady made him think of Granny Clampet, thus the change. He also pointed out that he added "Republicans," because he had received a shirt with "Republicans" written on it that reminded him of the joke, which he wanted to make less racist. By referencing the comic popular culture fig- ure of Granny Clampet, the teller has substantially altered the joke. Rather than leaving the audience to fill in the character of "the old white lady" with their own images, the narrator intertextually references a figure who may be laden with numerous humorous associations based on her role in the television series. Ajoke performer or someone who has heard ajoke before may picture the person who previously told them the joke, images from the punch line, or make other associations during the performance; whereas someone hearing the joke for the first time will examine the language and images of the joke from different perspectives to determine what the humor of the</page><page sequence="7">ASSOCIATIVE CONTEXT 323 joke is. I asked one informant if he visualized anything when he recited a joke he knew about cannibals. He replied, "I do visualize it. There's a very specific visualization of this; Don Martin in Mad Magazine. Some of his jokes have cannibals with bones through their nose. Whenever I tell this joke, I visualize Don Martin's comics." He went on to explain that Mad Magazine was a part of his fond childhood memories. When I asked this same infor- mant about a joke he told involving a Nazi mother who encourages her children to eat with the pun "Ess, ess," he replied, "I visualized a working class woman. This specific vision comes from a movie I saw about working class Germans in the twenties." When I asked another informant about a joke he told that was set in a barbershop, he described it as "Floydesque" (Floyd is the barber on The Andy Griffith Show). Surprisingly, my visualiza- tion of this scene also employed imagery from Floyd's barber shop. The imagery used to visualize one joke may be used in other jokes as well. Describing the images of the joke, "What is grosser than gross? Eat- ing Corn Flakes and finding out your brother was saving his scab collec- tion," one informant said: Yeah, it's the same thing I've always pictured since I was really little. It's a really dark kitchen with a white refrigerator which is open with a bright light on, and there's this big bowl of Corn Flakes actually, not scabs. I used to know a really long involved joke involving the same refrigerator, but it involved a man with half an arm and pus squirting out of him. I really can't remember what it was. It is interesting that the individual partially remembered a related joke because of a similarity in visualized details. She has forgotten the joke but remembers aspects of its imagery. The degree to which visual imagery inter- acts with and/or predominates over spoken elements of jokes and other narrative forms needs further investigation. One informant always visualizes his father in a series of jokes he and his family tell involving a man who goes into restaurants and is rude to wait- ers. For instance: This guy goes into a restaurant and asked the waiter, "What do you have today?" He says, "I have chopped liver, uhm, bull's tail, uhm ah, ah, bull's balls, and, ah, frog legs." So the guy tells him, [irritated rapid voice] "Don't tell me your problems, I asked what you have to eat!" The informant's father was always very familiar with waiters, and conse- quently the informant imagined his father as the man in this joke cycle. Furthermore, he characterized this series of jokes as his "father's jokes"</page><page sequence="8">324 WESTERN FOLKLORE because his father often told these kinds of jokes. As noted above, individuals who have told or heard a certain joke on previous occasions already know the content and are thus more likely to experience a fixed set of images in their mind's eye as accompaniment to the joke. Individuals hearing the joke for the first time, on the other hand, must shift and reorganize the images they are experiencing in order to "get" the joke. During my research I asked a series of questions about jokes which individuals were experiencing for the first time. The disparities as well as similarities in people's replies are suggestive. The responses to questions about the spaghetti-sweater joke men- tioned above demonstrate the range of variability that may occur when jokes are being visualized. For the most part, the Italian woman, when pic- tured, was elderly. In some cases she was imagined with a bun or some kind of scarf on her head. These factors of age and head ornament may be attributed to the fact that the woman is described as knitting, a behavior associated with older women by some of the individuals I questioned. In several instances the Italian woman was pictured with dark hair, probably because she was identified as an Italian. The image of the woman reminded some individuals of their own relatives. An informant of Italian descent described the woman as a composite of several relatives. Another informant said that she reminded him of his grandmother. The meatballs, the element that brought laughter (if people laughed) appeared rolling, bouncing, with legs, normal sized, human sized, and in other guises. One woman said she visualized the meatballs as similar to the logo from her husband's work. He worked at a shop called "The Running Spot" whose emblem was a large running spot with human legs. A number of women that I interviewed visualized the meatballs not as food items, but as obnoxious or stupid men. One woman who did not think the joke was funny said, "When you said the meatballs chased her home, the first images I had were meatballs, giant meatballs. But then I said, 'Oh no, that's not what it means; it means stupid men."' When I asked her, "Why do you think this joke might be funny to yourself or others?" She said, "If it does mean musclely, stupid, brain-dead men, they might be so stupid that they would chase a woman down because her sweater has food items in it." She went on to say, [with a tone suggesting a negative attitude towards the joke] "Yeah, but then the other connotations; if they took the sweater off her, she's naked." Another woman who thought the joke was "kind of creepy" said that the meatballs "hint of nasty, annoying men fol- lowing you around, pinching your butt, making disgusting remarks." When I asked her, "Why did they remind you of men?" She answered:</page><page sequence="9">ASSOCIATIVE CONTEXT 325 It's because of the word "balls"; they have male connotations, meat too. They're male things. They were male meatballs. I thought of them as men....They were rolling and bumping, like bouncing. They definitely made me think of men. Several other women, when questioned, indicated that they visualized the meatballs either as males or men, whereas male informants made no references to the sexuality of the meatballs, but indicated they enjoyed the joke because of the anthropomorphic meatballs. If we examine the responses a bit further, we may catch a glimpse of the way jokes are imagined as they unfold. One individual I interviewed said, "First when you were talking about the spaghetti, even before you were talk- ing about the meatballs, I was thinking about eating the sweater [laugh- ing] ." A second interviewee initially considered what it would be like to wear the sweater: "It seems kind of gross to wear spaghetti in a sweater, because it would dry out right away." In another case, a female informant indicated that she started by imagining the woman as older, but then, try- ing to second guess the course of the narrative, pictured the woman as younger: "At first I thought of an older woman. But then when you men- tioned the spaghetti, I thought of her as younger and voluptuous, because I thought the sweater might fall off of her." This informant also initially pic- tured the meatballs as meat, and then, subsequently, as men. As ByronJ. Good points out: A plot...is not simply present as the structure of a narrative but is cre- ated by readers moment by moment as they proceed through a text, finding themselves limited to "the blind complexity of the present" (Ricoeur 1981:279) and seeking to uncover and antici- pate the structure and meaning of unfolding events (Good 1994:143). Jokes are particularly interesting since they are a kind of mental puzzle that requires solving. Indeed, a number of jokes are based on a sudden cog- nitive shift in which one image is created only to be suddenly replaced by another. For example: "What's twelve inches long and hangs in front of an asshole? Johnny Cochran's tie."1 The second group of visual associations I would like to examine are responses to questions about the joke, "Why do you tell a husband to boil water when his wife is having a baby? In case it dies, you can have soup." When I asked individuals if they visualized anything in response to the joke, the imagery related by various informants focused on what might be termed old-fashioned or rural features. An old house, a quilt on a bed, and a midwife, though not mentioned in the joke, were pictured by various</page><page sequence="10">326 WESTERN FOLKLORE individuals as part of the joke. Two female respondents described the wife "as screaming in pain because she's in labor" and "screaming 'I'm having a baby'." For the first informant, a husband was imagined as "frantically boiling water." The second informant described the husband as ineffectual, "sort of looking helpless." These responses may be suggestive of gen- dered conceptualization of childbirth. The women respondents may have been more likely to conceptualize the pain of the woman because it is a reality they might face themselves. A larger population needs to be queried in order to test this hypothesis. What can be said is that for some individuals, the mention of having a baby and boiling water evokes a variety of accompanying images such as temporal or geographic dis- tancing, or the pain of labor. The women who visualized the pain of the mother also envisioned rural or old-fashioned features in their percep- tualization of the joke. Thus it may be argued that on a psychological level, the pain associated with childbirth is both experienced and distanced within the context of conceptualizing this joke. Another set of responses deals with the punchline of this joke. One indi- vidual, in this case the person who originally told me the joke, emphatically pointed out the lack of visual images he experienced concerning the boil- ing of the baby: "I DO NOT go into the literal image of the baby dying, being put in hot water, and no imagery that would make it distasteful." Another informant pointed out that for her, the image dissipated or "crack[ed] up" when boiling the baby was mentioned. A different infor- mant imagined the baby as similar to a rubber doll: "And then the part about the soup, I just kind of thought of a big pot with a, like, a rubber baby doll in it." Another person said that he visualized the baby as a "Cabbage-Patch Doll." It may be argued that the respondents' visualiza- tions of this joke-the imagery of the baby dying and subsequently being made into soup-demonstrate defense mechanisms or psychological edit- ing as a response to the harsh contents. The image of the baby being boiled was unpleasant, thus it was not experienced or was ameliorated with the baby being imagined as doll. The use of visual editing as a defense mechanism was the case, I believe, for the individual who told the following joke: "What is the dif- ference between a truck full of bowling balls and a truck full of dead babies? You can't unload the truck full of bowling balls with a pitch- fork." When I asked the narrator what he visualizes when he tells this joke, he responded that he imagines trying to unload the truck full of bowling balls with a pitchfork. I, on the other hand, conceptualized the joke with images from my experiences of unloading trucks full of leaves with a pitch-</page><page sequence="11">ASSOCIATIVE CONTEXT 327 fork on top of a three story high dump. The actual feeling of sticking the pitchfork into the leaves along with images of a particular truck and location were unpleasantly brought to mind when I heard this "sick joke."4 Such jokes often evoke mixed aesthetic reactions. The mental response is often a rejection of the subject matter, which is indicated with statements such as "'That is gross!", whereas the physical response is laughter. For example, in one joking session an Israeli informant told ajoke about Hitler committing suicide when he got his gas bill. Another person present, a Hungarian Jew, responded, [laughing] "I don't think I can even laugh at that; I guess I am." In response, the Israeli informant laughed also. Phys- ically, the laughter may release anxiety and tensions which are displayed by the intellectual response of aversion. Understanding how individuals respond through conceptualizing such jokes with mental images is an important factor which must be accounted for if we are to understand such forms of humor.5 Informants had a number of different reactions to the following joke as a consequence of their conceptualization of the characters in the joke: "This guy goes into a restaurant and asks the waiter, 'Do you have frogs legs?' The waiter says, 'Yes.' The guy then says, 'Well hop to the kitchen and get me a good steak.'" The obnoxious customer was visualized by various respondents as "my father," "a Texan," and "a white male." An African- American woman said she pictured this customer as a white male because she associated the frog legs with French cuisine and French restaurants with white people. The informant who pictured this character as Texan thought it was due to the fact that she had encountered obnoxious Texans in other jokes. One informant pictured the waiter of this joke as "the same guy in 'Waiter there's a fly in my soup'." In some cases the waiter was imagined with frog legs or hopping, in others this was not a feature; the joke was simply and unfunnily about an obnoxious man toying with a waiter. One woman, drawing on her own restaurant work experience, imagined the waiter hopping through swinging kitchen doors into a kitchen. The car- toon-like visualization of the waiter hopping or with frog legs is not essen- tial to "getting" the joke, but it does seem be a reoccurring image that when experienced was central to people's amusement. This can be said for the meatball joke as well; it was the cartoon-like incongruency of food items acting like humans that made the joke enjoyable for many individuals. To compare responses, I employed a "Far Side" cartoon by Gary Larson in which an adult frog is saying to several younger frogs, "And as the net slooooooowly lifted him from the water, the voice kept whispering, 'I</page><page sequence="12">328 WESTERN FOLKLORE want your legs...I want your legs"' (Larson 1985:104). Again, people con- textualized this humor according to their own experiences. One informant responded: Well, it reminded me of another joke. It reminded me of a joke about a fish who was talking to a group of other fish at the bottom of the lake with a fisherman's boat hanging on the surface of the water with the one fish telling the others [raised voice] "I was in the boat, man, I was in the boat." Most people imagined the creepy or whispering intonation of the frog's voice. I imagined my brother, who gigs frogs, out in the darkness of the pic- ture, and thought of the time that I ate some frog legs he had left in the refrigerator under the assumption that they were chicken. Another person thought this joke funny because she interpreted the frog legs as making a sexual double entendre related to the tale '"The Frog Prince." This same informant vividly described remembering the breaded frog legs she had eaten when she was five. One informant did not make the association that frog legs were food; he had never eaten frog legs. It made another infor- mant think of the frog scene in Cannery Row. Another cartoon used in interviews involves a picture of a caveman at the entrance to a cave with his spear in his hand. In the distance are a bison and two saber-toothed tigers. The caveman is speaking over his shoul- der and a cavewoman is facing the audience in the lower right hand corner of the picture with her head turned toward the caveman. The cap- tion reads, "Once in a while couldn't we just have some pasta" (Larson 1985:1). When I asked people "What immediately came to mind when you saw this joke?" One informant said he visualized the pasta, "Well I saw a plate of pasta, little capellini with red sauce...my pasta of choice." Several informants thought the joke was funny because it involved the battle between the sexes. However, several informants did not even notice the woman in the corner of the picture. For one informant, a vegetarian, the joke was dealing with vegetarian issues in terms of meat versus pasta. Another informant juxtaposed the image of a rough, burly caveman to the "anti-macho" pasta. As with the other jokes, this cartoon was not inter- preted in uniform ways, but rather in terms of individual or personal expe- riences. Joking may occur under a variety of circumstances. Actions such as eat- ing a bowl of cereal or passing a graveyard may bring out the memory of a joke or provide the proper framework for its telling. During a joking event, jokes may trigger any number of reactions which might be displayed or verbalized, or go unarticulated. Associations may be shared through con-</page><page sequence="13">ASSOCIATIVE CONTEXT 329 versation, various kinds of laughter, the performance of similar jokes or sto- ries, and in other ways. The particulars of ajoking situation bind and are bound, give meaning and are made meaningful, by these streams of associations that people bring to, and in turn, take away from such events. In examining the responses to various questions on pictorial and spoken jokes, we find a high degree of variability in the ways that different people processed the same joke. In some cases, the imagery that individuals expe- rienced when hearing or reciting "sick jokes" may be seen as a psycho- logical defense mechanism. The results of eliciting associations suggest that individuals interact with jokes according to their varying life experiences. As Georges points out, individuals "assume social identities for the purpose of the event." In the joking context, these are the shifting roles of joke teller and audience. But they "also have other social identities that function coincidentally with the selected social identity of...teller or...listener" (Georges 1969:318). These identities, whether they are based on gender, eating habits, work experiences, past friendships, family relationships, etc., are integral to how we as individuals process humor as it unfolds. Behavior based on such roles is what makes the customarily shared occa- sion of joking "paradoxically traditional and unique, and communal and individual, at the same time" (Georges 1990:56). University of California Los Angeles, California Notes 1 On the behavioral approach, see Georges and Jones 1995, Chapters 8 and 9. 2 Fifteen individuals (eight females and seven males) were questioned about jokes they told, or were presented with jokes and then interviewed about their reactions to them. These interviews were conducted between February 26th and March 14th, 1996. The informants were graduate students studying either folklore or history. They were chosen haphazardly based upon availability and the performance of jokes in my presence. Ethnicity and age varied. 3 I am indebted to Peter Tokofsky for this example. 4 For a discussion of "sick jokes" about dead babies see Alan Dundes 1979. SAlan Dundes and Thomas Hauschild examine "Auschwitz Jokes" in Dundes and Hauschild 1983. My informant related to me that such jokes were often told in Israel.</page><page sequence="14">330 WESTERN FOLKLORE Works Cited Braid, Donald. 1996. Personal Narrative and Experiential Meaning.
