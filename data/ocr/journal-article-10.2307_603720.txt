<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Aramaic Version of the Bible: Contents and Context. By ETAN LEVINE. BZAW 174. Berlin: WALTER DE GRUYTER, 1988. Pp. xiv + 258. DM118. The title of this book promises far more than it delivers. Despite the fact that Levine is not to be faulted, in principle, merely for attempting "to address as varied a genre of writ- ings as the Aramaic targum as though it were a unitary cor- pus" (p. vii), his methodology and conclusions are seriously flawed. Much is assumed by assertion, and there is far too little interaction with previous scholarship in the field, which should have been employed in order to supply perspective and balance to the work. Levine lumps all the targumim together for the purpose of this volume, thereby reducing all his analysis to common de- nominator discussion of features shared by a variety of the Aramaic versions. By stressing shared aspects of the targu- mim, Levine gives up the opportunity to make fine distinctions among them. As the focus becomes broader, it becomes, per- force, less sharp. On the other hand, Levine admits that "in treating theological aspects of the Aramaic Bible I have often been constrained to describe rather than to define" (p. viii, italics mine), and this is the single methodological issue where he has progressed beyond most others who have attempted to deal with the difficult questions of rabbinic and targumic the- ology. The materials under consideration are perhaps too com- plex to lend themselves to definition, although they do lend themselves to description, and proper description is superior to faulty definition. Any work that attempts to analyze targumic Weltan- schauung must first grapple with translation technique(s) and exegetical methodology/-ies. If it does not, theological con- clusions are bound to be drawn from passages that merely manifest ordinary translation technique and typical targumic exegesis. This is an unfortunately common error in targumic studies, and Levine, like many others, has fallen victim to it. The value of the last 180 pages of the book, the section on tar- gumic theology, is highly questionable due to this failure. There are simply no criteria established for what constitute the building blocks of targumic theology; instead we are treated to a list of topics that occur with some frequency in some targu- mim, and which are at times theologically significant. But at times they are not, because they grow naturally out of the translation or exegesis of the Hebrew text. Furthermore, Levine does not distinguish between phenomena that are stan- dard rabbinic/midrashic and those uniquely targumic, and it is only by separating the two from one another that we can avoid the characterization of targum as just another form of rabbinic literature. When Levine does quote rabbinic material pertaining to targum, he assembles and strings together texts without regard to date, context and provenance. It is a real desideratum of targumic studies for all the rabbinic references to targum to be analyzed with all of the techniques currently available to the student of rabbinic literature, but Levine has neither attempted nor accomplished this goal. And when Levine cites some of this rabbinic material, his readings are rather idiosyncratic; e.g., his interpretation of TB Berakot 8a-8b (p. 10, n. 10) and TB Qiddushin 49a (p. 14). Levine's linguistic comments are also open to question. For example, he asserts that "PsJ is a virtually complete targum written in Galilean Jewish Aramaic, in large measure" (p. 25), and refers to "the familiar Babylonian Aramaic of the Targum 'Onqelos and the Babylonian Talmud" (p. 28, reviewer's ital- ics). In a work that could become a standard on the targumic reference shelf, these are frighteningly erroneous statements. In addition to the inability to draw fine lines of distinction among specific targumim because of treating them all to- gether, as indicated above, Levine further errs by extrapolat- ing excessively from texts such as pseudo-Jonathan and the targum to Ecclesiastes to the other Aramaic versions. Some of the later Aramaic versions are indeed more overt and forth- coming about their worldviews than are earlier ones, but more profit would have accrued had Levine invested effort in the more difficult extrapolation of theological stances from Onqe- los or the earlier Palestinian Pentateuchal material. The "wealth" of the later materials cannot always be safely used to enrich our portrait of the earlier versions. The collection of targumic data that Levine gathers in the latter portion of the book can be utilized for further independent analysis, but only if the student is aware of the skewed portrait drawn by relying on "atypical" targumim for the description of the Weltan- schauung of the overall corpus of the Aramaic versions. It is very likely that a book such as this should only be pro- duced after the individual targumim have been subjected to proper analysis similar to that which Levine attempts to apply to the whole corpus of targumic literature. After that has been done, we can proceed to the consideration of the entire body of targumic material in order to characterize it as an entity. Given the present state of targumic scholarship, our first re- sponsibility ought to be to produce works of a more focused and, hence, more limited, nature.</page><page sequence="2">Reviews of Books 325 For a book produced in 1988, this volume is curious in its bibliographical references, particularly in its omissions (sur- prising in the work of an Israeli scholar) of the substantial literature on the targumim written in modem Hebrew. One looks in vain in the bibliography for references to the works of Avigdor Shinan (book and articles, including those in English), to Michael Klein's book on anthropomorphism, to Bernard Revel's and Z. Gottlieb's articles on pseudo-Jonathan (all in Hebrew), to Anthony York's standard articles on "The Dating of Targumic Literature," and "The Targum in the Synagogue and the School" (JSJ 1974 and 1979), J. Heinemann's articles on the targum and early halakhah (English and Hebrew), and to Pinkhos Churgin's books (English and Hebrew) on the targu- mim to the Prophets and the Hagiographa. This list is not meant to show the superiority of my note-cards over Levine's, but to demonstrate that there is much in the world of targumic schol- arship with which he has not been in dialogue, by choice or accident. A number of these works are particularly germane to the subject matter with which Levine has chosen to deal, and their absence is thus noteworthy. On the other hand, a good deal of the bibliography has almost nothing to do with targum. In addition to the above, the book itself is poorly produced. Hardly a page is without an error in English or in proof- reading. False references to primary sources abound. Whereas this may be explained as result of Israeli-produced, German- published scholarship, it is hardly excusable as a result. The index of sources, too, is far less serviceable than it ought to have been. There is no separate listing of Hebrew and Ara- maic citations of biblical passages, and, needless to say, cita- tions from the various targumim of a single biblical verse are lumped together in the index. In sum, this is not a book to be recommended. The one vol- ume introduction to and summary of targumic studies has yet to be written. MOSHE J. BERNSTEIN YESHIVA UNIVERSITY</page></plain_text>
