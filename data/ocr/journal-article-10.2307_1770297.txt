<plain_text><page sequence="1">EKBERT FAAS Faust and Sacontald RICH HELLER has argued that Faust's "tragedy" is "that he is incapable of tragedy." There is "no catharsis, only metamorpho- sis." The protagonist, instead of being "purified in a tragic sense" or "raised above [his] guilt through atonement," simply follows a "never- ending journey of self-exploration." For ultimately, Goethe lacked what tragedy presupposes: "the belief in an external order of things which is . . . incomplete without the conformity of the human soul, but would still be more defective without the soul's freedom to violate it."1 A belief in "an external order of things," in which even suffering can be shown to assume a meaningful role,2 has indeed been the conditio sine qua non of our tragic understanding of life ever since the Poetics, the Oresteia, or Job: in Aristotle tragic suffering is extolled for exert- ing a cathartic effect on the audience, in Aeschylus it is shown to lead to man's progress in history, and in the Book of Job it is displayed in order to confirm our belief in God's ultimate justice. And if the greatest mod- ern theoretician of tragedy had lived to see Faust II, he too would pre- sumably have criticized the play for lacking a truly tragic dimension. For by providing us with a synthesis of its classical and Judeo-Christian components, Hegel described the tragic as a mode which by its very display of human suffering hints at the "vision of eternal justice"3 to be reached in the providential dialectics of world history. Modern philosophy, of course, has been questioning such notions for some time, and, analogously, recent playwrights and aestheticians have described tragedy as a falsification of life (Robbe-Grillet),4 declared it 1 "Goethe and the Avoidance of Tragedy," in Tragedy, Vision and Form, ed.

This tendency can be traced back to Schopenhauer who, influenced by Eastern philosophy, came to see the world as a manifestation, not of purposefulness, provi- dence, or divine justice, but of the blind will of life, and tragedy as an enactment of the "horrific side of life" ("schreckliche Seite des Le- bens") inducing a state of resignation in the spectator." A similar rein- terpretation of tragedy as an unpitying display of the "natural cruelty of things" ("natiirliche Grausamkeit der Dinge")' rather than of the "external order of things" was upheld by Schopenhauer's most influen- tial disciple. Yet unlike his teacher, Nietzsche felt that such a theater of cruelty would induce the spectators not to renounce but to embrace life. The present-day practitioners of a thdatre de la cruaute in the wake of Artaud, who defined drama as a "continuous creation" reenacting life in its implacable duality of creation and destruction ("la vie c'est tou- jours la mort de quelqu'un"),s are the direct, though for the most part unwitting, heirs of this concept. By being reduced to a mere spectacle of cruelty, however, tragedy be- comes an ateleological opposite of its original conception, so tlhat the term ceases to be meaningful. No wonder, then, that it is hardly even mentioned by such writers as Artaud, Jerzy Grotowski, or Peter Brook, while to those who continue to discuss it, the term denotes an obsolete literary mode based on a world view they can no longer believe in. To Robbe-Grillet, for instance, tragedy becomes a falsification of life in the form of a test "oui la victoire consisterait a tre vaincu."9 Or as Robbe- Grillet's mentor Roland Barthes wrote: "La tragedie n'est qu'un moyen de recueillir le malheur humain, de le subsumer, donc de le justifier sous la forme d'une necessite, d'une sagesse ou d'une purification: refuser cette recuperation et rechercher les moyens techniques de ne pas y suc- comber traitreusement (rien n'est plus insidieux que la tragedie) est aujourd'hui une entreprise necessaire" (quoted in Robbe-Grillet, p. 55). Such statements, which one could continue to list ad infinitum, point up the historical limitations of a concept which most critics still tend to treat as universally human. A look at non-Western literature, in which tragedy is, for the most part, conspicuously absent, suggests that there is a cultural as well as a historical line of demarcation. Sanskrit drama, for instance, which of all world drama comes closest to rivaling the 5 Eugene Ionesco, Notes et contre-notes (Paris, 1966), pp. 61, 297. 6 Arthur Schopenhauer, Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung, in Siimtliche kWerke, ed.

This, of course, is mainly because Indian philosophy tends to treat suffering and destruction as an accepted part of life, unredeemed by evolutionary progress or the cos- mic justice of a God who is the summum bonum antipode of all evil. As G. K. Bhat puts it, the Indian God "creates life; He sustains it; but also destroys it, as a necessity for next creation."10 All this seems to posit the need for reconsidering Goethe's "avoid- ance of tragedy" in his Faust. What if the poet, instead of acting in in- tellectual confusion and "inevitable contradiction of the undedicated mind and heart,"'1 was searching, long before Barthes and Robbe-Gril- let, for a means to avoid the tragic falsification of life? Goethe himself, only five months before he died, provided an answer to this question which, apart from implying a similar attitude toward the tragic, reads like a retrospective comment on the gradual evolution of his Faust: "Ich bin nicht zum tragischen Dichter geboren, da meine Natur konziliant ist; daher kann der rein-tragische Fall mich nicht interessieren, welcher eigentlich von Haus aus unvers6hnlich sein muB, und in dieser iibrigens so duBerst platten Welt kommt mir das Unvers6hnliche ganz absurd vor" (B, IV, 458).12 As is well known, Goethe's play is based on the Dr. Faustus legend, which as the prototype of Christian punitive tragedy gives us the retri- butive counterpart to God's benevolent justice as displayed in Job. Dr. Faustus, a Renaissance magus whose occult and philosophical pursuits have led him to rebel against the Christian faith, forms a pact with the devil and is damned. Goethe reinforces the biblical analogy by prefacing his play with a "Prologue in Heaven," whose heavenly courtroom sce- nario was directly inspired by the opening of the Book of Job. Exposed to the temptations of the devil, Faust will be given a single lifetime to prove himself right or wrong. Goethe's Faust, of course, does neither, to Tragedy and Sanskrit Drama (Bombay, 1974), p. 105. 11 Heller, p. 390. 12 In this and subsequent citations, I use the following abbreviations: B: Briefe, Hamburger Ausgabe, 4 vols.

Unlike Job, Faust is never vindicated by the Lord, who does not return to the play after his brief appearance in the "Prologue." Unlike the Dr. Faustus of the Volksbuch and the puppet plays, Faust is not damned but raised to heaven, although he never repents his sins. It seems deliberately ironic that Goethe, in the scene in which angels fight with devils for the possession of Faust's soul, has Mephisto incur the fate which the "Prologue" has led us to expect for the protagonist. The hunter has become the hunted, and Mephisto, not Faust, is about to become a second Job: "Wie wird mir !-Hiobsar- tig, Beul' an Beule / Der ganze Kerl, dem's vor sich selber graut" (lines 11809-10). It is difficult to think of any major work of Western literature, includ- ing Oedipus at Colonnus, which could have served Goethe as a model for this transformation of the Job-Faustus myths. There is, however, a drama by the Indian poet Kalidasa which seems to have played that very role in the gradual evolution of the drama. Goethe first read Sacontal6 in Forster's 1791 German translation from the English version by Sir William Jones (1789). In an immediate outburst of enthusiasm, Goethe wrote to Jacobi: Will ich die Blumen des friihen, die Friichte des spiteren Jahres, Will ich was reizt und entziickt, will ich was sdittigt and niihrt, Will ich den Himmel die Erde mit Einem Namen begreifen; Nenn ich Sakontala dich und so ist alles gesagt. (B, II, 140) We have Goethe's repeated testimony that Sacontald overwhelmed him in an irresistible way, that it exerted "the greatest influence . . . on his entire life,"13 that he came to know it more or less by heart, and 13 See W, XI, 187 (Italienische Reise, March 1, 1787) : "Von dem heutigen Tage wire schwerlich Rechenschaft zu geben. Wer hat es nicht erfahren, da8 die fliichtige Lesung eines Buchs, das ihn unwiderstehlich fortriB, auf sein ganzes Le- ben den gr6P1ten Einflu3 hatte und schon die Wirkung entschied, zu der Wiederle- sen und ernstliches Betrachten kaum in der Folge mehr hinzutun konnte. So ging es mir einst mit 'Sakontala,' und geht es uns mit bedeutenden Menschen nicht gleicherweise ?" As commentators have pointed out, Goethe, who first discovered Sacontald in 1791, could not have written this in 1787. Hans-Heinrich Reuter (P, XIV, 963), following B. Suphan ("Goethe and Spinoza, 1783-1786," Festschrift, Berlin, 1881, pp. 192 ff.), therefore concludes that in the original journal Goethe had written S. (instead of "Sakontala") meaning Spinoza, and that the "Sakon- tala" in the printed version of Italienische Reise could not be due to a later change by Goethe's own hand. Reuter. argues that the poet "would hardly have attributed to this work the greatest influence of his entire life." The opposite seems nearer the truth if we compare Goethe's statement with his letter to Sacontald's French trans- lator Antoine Leonard de Chezy which (long after the rewriting of the Italian journals, during 1813-16, for publication in 1816-17) repeats his praise of Sccon- tald almost verbatim. 370</page><page sequence="5">FAUST &amp; SACO NTALA that it determined a whole epoch in his development. "Das erste Mal als ich dieses unergriindliche Werk gewahr wurde," he wrote on October 9, 1830, erregte es in mir einen solchen Enthusiasmus, zog mich dergestalt an, dag ich es zu studieren nicht unterlieB, ja sogar zu dem unmhglichen Unternehmen mich ge- trieben fiihlte, es, wenn auch nur einigermaBen, der deutschen Biihne anzueignen. Durch diese wenngleich fruchtlosen Bemiihungen bin ich mit dem h6chst schitz- baren Werke so genau bekannt geworden, es hat eine solche Epoche in meinem Lebensgange bestimmt, es ist mir so eigen geworden, daB ich seit dreiBig Jahren weder das Englische noch das Deutsche je wieder angesehen habe. (B, IV, 401) Although Goethe failed to adapt Sacontald to the stage, he success- fully integrated its general theme, its overall structure, and many of its details into the second part of Faust. Here the cosmological test situa- tion in a closed, legalistically determined universe, as found in Goethe's immediate sources, gradually yields to a concept of life as quest and self- purification, both continuing beyond death. Like King Dushmanta in Sacontald, Faust, in the first part, acts like a sex-obsessed egocentric who gets his beloved with child and then abandons her. Yet subsequently he learns detachment from self and compassion for the world in general. This is achieved in pursuit of the beloved who, preceding the protago- nist, is raised to heaven. But before the quest is fulfilled and the lovers reunited, Faust (like Dushmanta) must expose himself to the forces of the underworld and prove himself in action. Goethe's own short sum- mary of Sacontald alludes to many of these resemblances between the two plays: "Weibliche Reinheit, schuldlose Nachgiebigkeit, Vergell- lichkeit des Mannes, miitterliche Abgesondertheit, Vater und Mutter durch den Sohn vereint, die allernatiirlichsten Zustinde, hier aber in die Regionen der Wunder, die zwischen Himmel und Erde wie fruchtbare Wolken schweben, poetisch erhoht, und ein ganz gew6hnliches Natur- schauspiel durch G6tter und G6tterkinder aufgeffihrt" (W, XII, 301). "Feminine purity," "guiltless yielding," and "a mother's isolation" are as appropriate to Sacontald as they are to Faust. Equally applicable to both is "a man's forgetfulness": King Dushmanta forgets his beloved under the spell of a curse, as Faust forgets Gretchen under the phan- tasmagorical spells of Mephisto's Walpurgisnacht. Or consider the scene in which Faust and Helena rejoice about their union achieved through Euphorion's birth (lines 96-99 ff.). Here, although in a dif- ferent context and with consequences other than in Kalidasa's play, we have a second version of the motif "a father and mother united through the son." And what more appropriate summing up could one give of the general atmosphere of Faust II than that provided by the remainder of Goethe's Sacontald interpretation, and in particular of the play's last scene? To this one might add Goethe's characterization 371</page><page sequence="6">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE of Kalidasa, every word of which again could apply to the author of Faust: "Hier erscheint uns der Dichter in seiner h6chsten Funktion, als Repraisentant des natiirlichsten Zustandes, der feinsten Lebensweise, des reinsten sittlichen Bestrebens, der wiirdigsten Majestdit und der ernstesten Gottesbetrachtung: zugleich aber bleibt er dergestalt Herr und Meister seiner Schopfung, da13 er gemeine und licherliche Gegen- sfitze wagen darf, welche doch als notwendige Verbindungsglieder der ganzen Organisation betrachtet werden miissen" (B, IV, 401-02). As in the case of Faust, this "structure" of Kalidcsa's play may, of course, be disappointing to readers looking for the logical motivation and unity which Western critics since Aristotle tend to consider the prime attribute of drama or of literature in general. Neither Faust nor Sacontald can boast "one action, a complete whole, with its several inci- dents so closely connected that the transposal or withdrawal of any one of them will disjoin and dislocate the whole" (Poetics, 1451a, lines 33- 34) .14 At best their plots might be called "episodic," which in Aristotle's vocabulary characterizes the "worst" kind of action (Poetics, 1451b, line 33). Matthew Arnold, in saying that Faust "judged as a whole [is] de- fective,"1 echoes the discontent felt by many readers, while A. B. Keith, author of a standard work on Sanskrit drama, criticizes his subject for similar deficiencies.16 Here, of course, the poets themselves differ from their critics. Goethe emphatically agreed with Eckermann that the several sections of Faust all represent "ffir sich bestehende kleine Weltenkreise, die, in sich abge- schlossen, wohl aufeinander wirken, aber doch einander wenig angehen" (U, p. 584). Thus the plot of Faust, and of Part II in particular, which as Katharina Mommsen has shown in a pioneering study may also be influenced by another Oriental "source," The Thousand and One Nights,17 seems to be completely at odds with Aristotelian precepts. As Goethe concluded in talking about his great work, "Je inkommensura- bler und ffir den Verstand unfal3licher eine poetische Produktion, desto besser" (ibid.). Although we do not have comparable statements by Kaliddsa, we do know that, like other Sanskrit playwrights, he subscribed to the poetics of Bharata's Natyasastra, or The Art of the Play (ca. first century B.C.). Bharata had no need to take his stand against anything like an 14 Here and in subsequent references Aristotle's Poetics is quoted in the trans- lation by Ingram Bywater, Rhetoric and Poetics (New York, 1954). 15 The Poems, ed.

Bharata discusses various types of action and devices of plot structure. But instead of the unity of action he empha- sizes the unity of spirit and tone (rasa),1s and defines drama in the most general terms, not as the "imitation of ... one action, a complete whole" (Poetics, 1451a, lines 32-33), but as the "representation of con- ditions and situations."19 The range of situations he prescribes seems to preclude the arrangement of the story in the neat causal chains of Aris- totle's anthropocentric universe. In the drama, Bharata writes, "there is no exclusive representation of you or of the gods: for the drama is a representation of the States (bhdvjnukIrtana) of the three worlds."24 The same emphasis is evident in Bharata's discussion of the various psychological states (bhavas) and sentiments (arising from the former) which, rather than plot structure and character portrayal-the highest criteria by Western standards--are considered the most crucial single elements of Sanskrit drama. Most of them-the "erotic sentiment," for instance, with its "two bases: union and separation," the basic theme of Sacontald--can be presented in the framework of a rationally coherent plot. Others, however, such as "fainting," "paralysis," "insanity," "epi- lepsy," "sleeping," and "dreaming," some of which again appear in Kd- lidisa's play, do, if portrayed in the manner of Sanskrit drama (or of Goethe's Faust), disrupt the simplistic psychological motivation re- quired by such coherence.21 Sanskrit drama generally, and Sacontald in particular, rarely tries to rationalize the irrational. When it does, more often than not it de- feats its own ends by the glaring illogicality of its premises. When King Dushmanta enters a hermitage during a hunt and spies the young Sacontala, his immediate response, like Faust's when he first sees Gretchen, is sexual infatuation. Kalidasa, although implying some dis- approval of the king, depicts these opening scenes with obvious zest and gusto. Even before she meets Dushmanta, Sacontalh, her maturing fig- ure bursting through her girlish dress, is associated with the phallic imagery which is ubiquitous throughout the play. Here is one of the jokes her playmates like to make at her expense: Priyamvad": O my Sacontala, let us remain some time in this shade. Sacontala: Why here particularly? 18 See K. C.

(S, p. 8) And the king, who shortly afterwards emerges from his hiding place behind a tree, seems to express the author's own bemused attitude in sexual matters when he hears that Sacontala is the daughter of a sage who had been successfully seduced by a nymph: Anusfyi: ... In the bloom of the vernal season, Causica [the sage], beholding the beauty of the celestial nymph, and wafted by the gale of desire- [She stops and looks modest. Dushmanta: I now see the whole. (S, p. 12) Yet Sacontald is no mere pastoral romance; before long the king and his beloved find themselves helpless preys to a passion which threatens to rob them of sleep, health, and reason. The ensuing action-a hasty marriage, the king's departure, and Sacontali's pregnancy-seems to prepare the ground for tragedy. Distracted by grief, Sacontal" neglects the law of hospitality and incurs a hermit's curse that Dushmanta will forget her. It is only because of Priyamvadi's last-minute intervention that the insulted hermit mitigates his curse: Dushmanta will recover his memory of Sacontala once he sees the ring he gave her before his depar- ture. All this, of course, would not meet even the Aristotelian standard of a "likely impossibility." Rather, it is full of those improbable incidents which according to the Poetics (1460a, lines 26-27) should have no place in a dramatic plot. On her way to the royal court, Sacontala loses the ring in the Ganges so that Dushmanta fails to remember her. Yet before the ring is retrieved from the belly of a fish to restore the king's memory, Sacontala is raised into the sky by a "body of light, in a female shape" (S, p. 64). Celestial powers must intervene again in order to save the king from the madness and distraction caused by the loss of his beloved. Indra's charioteer Matali challenges Dushmanta to fight the demons in the God's flying chariot; after the king has successfully performed his mission he is escorted into the heavenly hermitage on Mount HIImacuita. Here, where in the company of human hermits the Lord of Creation does penance with his consort, Dushmanta is finally reunited with his beloved. The similarities between the opening scenes of Sacontaldc and Faust I, much of which was completed before Goethe discovered Kilidasa in 1791, are, of course, merely coincidental. Moreover, Kilidasa's actual influence, unlike the enthusiasm Goethe felt for the Indian poet, was far from instantaneous. Instead it paralleled and reinforced a gradual pro- cess of self-liberation from "dem alten, rohen Volksmarchen" (U, p. A464) of Dr. Faustus which held Goethe spellbound for several decades. Characteristically, the Dr. Faustus legend had attracted his interest be- 374</page><page sequence="9">FAUST &amp; SACONTALA cause he had come to see the Renaissance magus as an alter ego of his youthful self dabbling in "mystico-cabalistic alchemy" (W, IX, 414). From the very beginning Goethe's Faust testifies to the poet's en- deavors to transcend the fatal implications of a mythic destiny he had come to recognize as his own. Prompted by the 1772 decapitation of a child murderess in Frankfurt, Goethe, in the Urfaust (1774, unpub- lished), transferred the tragic fate from the protagonist to his beloved. Yet even in this adapted form the ending seemed unacceptable to him. Suppressing the gruesome dungeon scene of the Urfautst, Goethe con- cluded Faust: Ein Fragment (1790) well before Gretchen's execution was fully in sight. Faust: Ein Fragment is the abortive product of a spiritual deadlock, and it took Goethe nearly a decade "den alten geronnenen Stoff wieder ins Schmelzen zu bringen" (U, p. 543). Yet even then he found himself unable to eliminate its tragic conception, which threatened his own ex- istence more than ever. On December 9, 1797, Goethe wrote to Schiller, "Ich kenne mich zwar nicht selbst genug, um zu wissen, ob ich eine wahre Tragodie schreiben konnte; ich erschrecke aber bloI3 vor dem Unternehmen und bin beinahe iiberzeugt, daB ich mich durch den bloB- en Versuch zerst6ren konnte" (W, XII, 688). Because "several tragic scenes . . . in prose," in particular Gret- chen in the dungeon, now appeared to him "ganz unertriiglich" (U, p. 543), part of his work toward the publication of Faust I (1808) was to mitigate their impact by rewriting them in verse. Moreover, Goethe al- ready anticipated that, despite Gretchen's tragic death, the end of the play was not to be tragic. Whatever he added to the Fragment was sub- ordinated to what, paralleling the Sanskrit concept of rasa,22 he called the "Geist und Ton des Ganzen" (U, p. 541), which in itself he saw as open-ended. All three of the "Schlu3gedichte" (written sometime be- tween 1797 and 1800, U, p. 754) emphasize this open-endedness by re- ferring either to the dreamlike process of creativity which inspired the play or to the open-endedness of life itself. "Abschied," the last of them, describes the same open-endedness as "the way to clarity" out of the tragic impasse (U, p. 431). In a "Schema zur gesamten Dichtung," dated April 11, 1800, Goethe translated this metaphysical rejection of a closed and tragic concept of life into a poetics which anticipates that of many twentieth-century poets. Form to him is no longer an idea- tional principle to be imposed on matter by way of "filling out what na- ture [left] undone" (Aristotle, Politics IV [VII], 17)23 but a by-prod- uct of content ("Gehalt bringt die Form mit," U, p. 439), or, in Charles 22 See Pandey, n. 18. 23 Quoted by W. K. Wimsatt and C. Brooks, Literary Criticism: A Short His- tory (New York, 1957), p. 26. 375</page><page sequence="10">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Olson's more recent formula, "never more than an extension of con- tent."24 Goethe must have had similar intentions when, probably around 1800 (U, p. 651), he wrote the "Prolog im Himmel," which sets the biblical stage for Faust's un-Christian salvation. Goethe uses no lesser figure than God himself to predict this untragic end of the play: Wenn er mir jetzt auch nur verworren dient, So werd' ich ihn bald in die Klarheit fiihren . . . Ein guter Mensch in seinem dunklen Drange Ist sich des rechten Weges wohl bewult. (lines 308-09, 328-29) Along this way into the light, Mephistopheles himself will be a major help to the protagonist. Unlike the "Abscheuliches Untier" of the Ur- faust ( U, p. 57), Mephisto gradually assumes the function of preventing man from falling into lethargy in his search for self-perfection (lines 332-43). Given the premises of Faust's subsequent wager with the devil, this makes the latter's impotence complete. In order to win his bet, Me- phisto would have to reduce the protagonist to the very state of lethargy he is there to prevent (lines 1692-93). Goethe was fully aware that he had maneuvered Mephisto into an inescapable impasse, or that Faust, as he puts it, "macht . . . dem Teufel eine Bedingung, woraus alles folgt" (U, p. 548). Although Sacontald may have been a major impulse behind all this, the play's impact on the creation of Faust was not to become fully ob- vious before the publication of its second part in 1832. At some time between 1795 and 1798 (U, p. 650), however, Goethe composed the "Vorspiel auf demrn Theater," which was directly inspired by Sacontald. Whereas Kalidasa's total influence on Faust has never been investi- gated,25 the fact that Goethe drew on Sacontald for his "Prelude in the Theater" is one of the ubiquitous, though for the most part unverified, commonplaces of Goethe scholarship. It is no wonder that the influence has also been denied, though Alwin Binder, who devoted a book-length study to the "Vorspiel," seems to reflect the attitude of most critics in acknowledging the possibility of such influence without bothering to argue the case in detail.26 Binder recognizes with Emrich that the "Vor- 24 Selected Writings, ed.

(S, p. 1) Preparing the audience for an uncommon cosmological spectacle, Goe- the, like KIlidasa before him, quickly reviews the whole of creation, naming the four elements and invoking the sun, the moon, and the stars.

In rejecting tragedy and banishing the devil, Goethe in "Abscheid," proposing that "Nach Osten sei der lichte Blick gewandt !" (U, p. 430),28 propagates a life of open-ended self-realization through "love and friendship" and an art which encourages man in this pursuit. Similarly, the poet in the "Prel- ude" remembers the time when in full responsiveness to nature he yearned for a life of godlike "love and friendship." This speech about "Lieb' und Freundschaft" reads like another thematic pr&amp;cis of Sacon- tald or a preview of Faust II as it was then beginning to evolve under Kdlid~sa's influence: Nein, fiihre mich zur stillen Himmelsenge, Wo nur dem Dichter reine Freude bliiht, Wo Lieb' und Freundschaft unsres Herzens Segen Mit G6tterhand erschaffen und erpflegen. (lines 63-66) How much of Faust II had been planned or written down when Goe- the composed the "Vorspiel" and the "SchluBgedichte" ? As pointed out earlier, the latter clearly presuppose a second part which Goethe first discussed expressis verbis in his "Schema zur gesamten Dichtung" of April 11, 1800. Shortly afterwards he composed "Helena im Mittelal- ter," which was later integrated into the third act of Part II. Records of a conversation on August 3, 1815, also show that Goethe, as early as 1800, may already have been drafting parts of the play's last act. Declaring that "vieles [of Faust II] ist auch schon fertig," the poet, when questioned about the ending, replied: "Das sage ich nicht, darf es- nicht sagen, aber es ist auch schon fertig und sehr gut und grandios geraten, aus der besten Zeit" (U, p. 548; cf. p. 638). When asked about the meaning of "the Mothers," Goethe, commenting on the final plan for his drama, simply referred to "my secret" (U, p. 464). It may well be that part of that secret was Kalidasa's Sacontald, which the poet, so far as we know, never mentioned in connection with Faust. 28 It is commonly assumed that "Osten" here points to classical Greece, al- though the latter is obviously located to the south rather than to the east of Ger- many. That Goethe may have meant the real East instead is also born out by one of his "Zahme Xenien" in which the liberating effect of the East is directly linked with "Kdlidisa and other" poets: Der Ost hat sie schon lingst verschlungen: Kalidas' und andere sind durchgedrungen; Sie haben mit Dichterzierlichkeit Von Pfaffen und Fratzen uns befreit. In Indien m6cht ich selber leben, HFItt es nur keine Steinhauer gegeben. Was will man denn vergnilglicher wissen! Sakontala, Nala, die mul man kiissen. (P, I, 651) 378</page><page sequence="13">FAUST &amp; SACONTALA Its solution in nuce is contained in the famous lines proclaiming Faust's salvation: Gerettet ist das edle Glied Der Geisterwelt vom B6sen, Wer immer strebend sich bemiiht, Den k6nnen wir erl6sen. Und hat an ihm die Liebe gar Von oben teilgenommen, Begegnet ihm die selige Schar Mit herzlichem Willkommen. (lines 11934-41) "In diesen Versen," Goethe said in 1831, "ist der Schlfissel zu Fausts Rettung enthalten" (U, p. 589). Yet his attempts to relate them to the Christian concept of grace or to point out "die scharf umrissenen christ- lich-kirchlichen Figuren und Vorstellungen," which supposedly give the last scene "eine wohltaitig beschr~inkende Form und Festigkeit" (ibid.), are misleading rather than elucidating. They seem prompted by the same defensiveness toward his readers which on other occasions could provoke Goethe to react more angrily and at the same time more truthfully. Such an instance was provided by F. F6rster's conjecture that Mephisto would ultimately be made to confess that a good human being is well aware of the right path in his heart's impulses. In reply, Goethe shook his head, protesting: "Das wire ja Aufkliirung. Faust endet als Greis, und im Greisenalter werden wir Mystiker" (U, p. 571). Goethe noted that, in contrast to Faust I, that "barbaric composition" based on the "old, crude folktale" (U, pp. 472, 542), everything in the second part was raised to a "higher and nobler level," the whole taking place in "higher regions" approaching "the ideal" (U, pp. 463, 561, 593). The poet's view of Sacontald as a spectacle enacted in "realms of wonders, that hover like fecund clouds between heaven and earth," sug- gests the immediate model for such elevation. It is true that Goethe did not completely eliminate the Judeo-Christian framework from Faust, and that instead of the Indian myths with which he was familiar, he availed himself of Greek mythology in order to exorcise the "monkish barbarism" (U, p. 566) of his sources. Still, the ideational sequence in which he displayed his "perceptions and impressions" (U, p. 563) finds an analogue in Sacontald rather than in works of classical or Judeo- Christian origin. Sophocles' Oedipus, whose ultimate apotheosis probably constitutes the closest parallel to Faust's salvation within Western drama, is the obvious case in point. As Goethe himself pointed out, Oedipus is not apotheosized because he has purified himself in action, but despite his "demonic constitution" and the "sinister vehemence of his existence" 379</page><page sequence="14">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE ("Nachlese zu Aristoteles' Poetik," W, XII, 343-44). By contrast, Faust has earned his apotheosis by turning from his sex-obsessed ego- centricity to the service of others. Nor does his development tally with any of the diverse Christian doctrines concerning divine grace versus good works. Whether these declare man unable to do good (Rom. vii. 18) without the free gift of divine grace (St. Augustine's gratia gratis data), or capable, at least in part, of earning God's grace through good works, they all share a general moralistic framework for judging man in terms of good and evil. By contrast, Faust's development is primarily psychological and takes place largely in a realm beyond good and evil. It is this in particular which has attracted the disapproval of Erich Heller, for whom Faust, as we saw, is "not raised above [his] guilt through atonement, but [enters], as it were, a biologically, not morally, new phase of life, healed by oblivion and restored to strength through the sleep of the just."29 It would be more appropriate to say, in Aldous Huxley's terms, that Goethe, like Homer before him, "refused to treat [his] theme tragically" and instead "preferred to tell the Whole Truth."30 For what more devastating, almost sardonic vision of the ev- er-implicit evil in human action could there be than that provided by the last act of Faust II? It is customary to quote Lynkeus' famous lines as Goethe's own credo: Ihr gliicklichen Augen, Was je ihr gesehn, Es sei, wie es wolle, Es war doch so sch6n! (lines 11300-03) Far less often is it remembered that immediately afterwards the same eyes are made to see a hell of Faust's own creation. Philemon and Bau- cis, the good-natured old couple, are burned to death in their hut by Faust's henchmen because they refused to surrender their little chapel to the colonizer's capitalist greed. Such evil is equaled only by the fu- tility implicit in Faust's last endeavors. The blind old hero experiences his life's fulfillment at the sound of shovels which, he believes, are per- forming the work of colonization but which are, in fact, digging his grave. Goethe was no doubt as aware of the deep-seated irony in these scenes as of the callousness with which his protagonist pursues his goal despite worry and guilt. Of the four allegorical old women, "Guilt" (like "Want" and "Distress") does not even gain access to Faust's palace: "Care," although she robs the hero of his eyesight, only heightens the 29 Heller, pp. 390-91. 30 "Tragedy and the Whole Truth," in Corrigan, p. 78.

As Heller notes, the opening scene of Faust II, where the hero relieves himself of his guilt-ridden conscience in sleep, sets this new tone of antitragic ruthlessness, yet hardly in the escapist and confused spirit which Heller attributes to Goethe. Instead, the con- fusion seems to be all on the part of the critic, who, unlike Goethe, can see the world only in the narrow terms of our "tragic humanism" with its ultimately anthropomorphic "order of things.""3 Goethe's universe resembles neither the courtroom cosmology of Job nor the zoon politicon congregation of rational citizens for whom Aristotle wrote his Poetics. Analogously, his general conception of drama has little in common with the shock-treatment display of passion and violence through which tragedy should purge the spectators of such irrationalities. Goethe, com- menting on Aristotle's Poetics, denies that art can teach and redefines catharsis in a way which seems closer to the Sanskrit concept of Santa than to the Aristotelian principle. What Indian aesthetics characterizes as "a sense of wholeness" inducing a state of serenity in the spectator32 becomes a "reconciliating rounding off" to Goethe: "Diese auss6hnende Abrundung, welche eigentlich von allem Drama, ja sogar von allen po- etischen Werken gefordert wird" (W, XII, 343). Moreover, Goethe finds it difficult to see nature and fate in the an- thropomorphic terms ascribed to them by the tragic humanism of Greek and Biblical origin. As he explained to Eckermann, "Da wird kein Ge- richt gehalten und da ist keine Frage, ob er es verdient oder nicht ver- dient habe, wie es etwa von Menschen-Richtern geschehen k6nnte" (U, p. 556). Nature, as embodied in Ariel and his elves, is indifferent to human right or wrong, and out of the infinite compassion of her regen- erative force she brings the hero back to life: "Ob er heilig, ob er b6se, / Jammert sie der Ungliicksmann" (lines 4619-20). From the very beginning of Faust II, Goethe avoids the tragic falsifi- cation of life by turning the tragic destiny of the original Dr. Faustus into a shamanistic quest involving the hero's death and rebirth.33 Con- sidering the agonies Faust had suffered on account of Gretchen, Goethe could, as he pointed out later, "help himself in no other way" than to consider the protagonist as destroyed "and to rekindle a new life from this apparent death": "Wenn man bedenkt, welche Greuel beim Schlul3 des Ersten Teils auf Gretchen einstiirmten und riickwirkend Fausts ganze Seele erschfittern muflten, so konnt ich mir nicht anders helfen, als den Helden, wie ich's getan, v6llig zu paralysieren und als vernichtet 31 Robbe-Grillet, p. 55. 32 See P.

As elsewhere in the play, this healing journey takes its course through dream and the unconscious. After Faust has fainted at the sudden disappearance of Helena, for instance, he is made to un- dergo a similar shamanistic initiation of "stirb und werde." Here his dreams, in which the Eternal-Feminine appears to him in the shape of Leda, beloved of Zeus and mother of Helen, are described by the newly born Homunculus who stands beside the sleeping hero (lines 6903 ff.). Both of these scenes seem to draw on similar ones in Sacontald. Like Faust, King Dushmanta is paralyzed by grief at the loss of his beloved and, like Faust at the disappearance of Helena, falls into a swoon. If imagined in the setting of a Greek play the king, who is distracted to the point of madness, could well be expected to mutilate himself like a sec- ond Oedipus. But Sanskrit drama avoids the grand gestures of tragic defiance. Although temporarily disturbed by worry and guilt, Dush- manta continues his search for peace (Janta) which, paralleling its equivalent in Indian aesthetics (see n. 32) or Goethe's "auss6hnende Abrundung" ( W, XII, 343), also constitutes the ultimate effect the play should exert on the audience. And whoever searches can be saved. It is in this sense, not in terms of either good works or divine gratia gratis data or a romantic beneficence of Nature, that a number of elfin and mythological creatures come to the king's assistance; it is through this never-ceasing pursuit of self-enlightenment, not because of divine provi- dence, that Faust's salvation, like Dushmanta's, is preordained: Ein guter Mensch in seinem dunklen Drange Ist sich des rechten Weges wohl bewul3t . . . Wer immer strebend sich bemiiht, Den kinnen wir erlSsen. (lines 328-29, 11936-37) In both Faust II and Sacontald guardian spirits herald such salvation. Like Ariel hovering around the unconscious Faust, Misracesi assures the audience that Dushmanta "will speedily be roused.-I heard the nymph Devajanani consoling Sacontala in these words: 'As the gods delight in their portion of sacrifices, thus wilt thou soon be delighted by the love of thy husband' " (S, p. 80). Misracesi is only one of many spirits from KalidSsa's colorful super- natural world which, along with Shakespeare's, must have exerted a powerful influence on Goethe. While Kaliddsa's hero repeatedly fights the demons, Goethe's descends into the underworld or exposes himself to Mephisto's phantasmagoria. As the elves take pity on Faust, so "even the trees . . . and the birds sympathize" with Dushmanta (S, p. 29). 382</page><page sequence="17">FAUST &amp; SACONTALA The woodnymphs show similar concern for Sacontali when she is about to begin her journey in search of her lost husband: CHORUS of invisible WOODNYMPHS: May her way be attended with prosperity! May propitious breezes sprinkle, for her delight, the odoriferous dust of rich blossoms! May pools of clear water, green with the leaves of the lotos, refresh her as she walks! and may shady branches be her defence from the scorching sunbeams! [All listen with admiration. (S, p. 47) As in Faust, Nature's life-giving forces are a central theme in Sacon- taldi; in both plays it is through love that man becomes an integral part of them. The phallic imagery of the creeper clinging to the tree empha- sizes Sacontala's and Dushmanta's sexual infatuation; an earlier men- tion of "the nuptials even of plants" (S, p. 8) seems to bestow Nature's blessing upon their union in advance. Sacontala matures into marriage by her ever-growing love of Nature. Priyamvada predicts the heroine's nuptials from the fact that her "nurture of these plants has prospered" (S, p. 9), while the sage Canna, anticipating Sacontala's reunion with the king, decides to stage a ritual ceremony in which he will marry Sa- contala's "favourite plant to the bridegroom Amra, who sheds fragrance near her" (S, p. 48). Similarly, Faust's search for the regenerative forces of Nature takes its impulse from distinctly sexual yearnings for the feminine principle even before he meets Gretchen. Steeped in hermetic lore, Faust knows that "Die Geisterwelt ist nicht verschlossen; / Dein Sinn ist zu, dein Herz ist tot !" (lines 443-44). But his self-questioning already suggests the right answer: Wo fass' ich dich, unendliche Natur ? Euch Briiste, wo ? Ihr Quellen alles Lebens, An denen Himmel und Erde hangt. (lines 455-57) These verses and the yearnings they express were, of course, conceived long before Goethe read Sacontald. But it was only after he had done so that he devised the story of their fulfillment. Thus Faust's love quest for Helena and Gretchen closely follows Dushmanta's search for Sacontalk. Contemplating an image of his beloved who, like Gretchen, has been raised into heaven by a "body of light, in a female shape" (S, p. 64), Dushmanta, "stark mad with love and affliction" (S, p. 77), begins to resemble "a traveller who negligently passes by a clear and full rivulet, and soon ardently thirsts for a false appearance of water on the sandy desert" (S, p. 75). In a similar scene, which prefigures the conclusion of the entire drama, Faust believes he recognizes Gretchen in a delicate, bright wisp of cloud (line 10055) rising into the sky: 383</page><page sequence="18">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Wie Seelensch-nheit steigert sich die holde Form, LSst sich nicht auf, erhebt sich in den Ather hin Und zieht das Beste meines Innern mit sich fort. (lines 10064-66) Unlike Kalidasa, Goethe introduces this figure, beckoning the hero to follow him into heaven, as the last of many who, in a long and mean- dering search for the "springs of all life," become the guides of the quester. Almost all of these are female; an exception like Chiron com- pletely fails to understand the hero's quest, attributing to craziness what Manto, the nymph who finally leads Faust into the underworld, be- stows with the highest praise: "Den lieb' ich, der Unmo6gliches begehrt" (line 7488; ef. line 7447). Thus the transformation of tragedy into a shamanistic quest for the Eternal-Feminine34 goes hand in hand with the gradual disappearance of the masculine pantheon of Christian myth- ology, as presented in the "Prolog im Himmel." To an Indian poet and his audience, the Eternal-Feminine was a tra- ditionally accepted concept. Kalidfisa therefore finds it sufficient to show how the king enters a new spiritual life by his love for one woman. A passing reference to the "father of the immortals" and his divine consort (S, p. 87) on Mount HU'mactita, the scene of the play's last act, is suffi- cient to remind the audience of the wider mythological implications of this love story. Lacking any such beliefs or mythologems in his imme- diate cultural heritage, Goethe would have met with little understand- ing if he had replaced Western with Indian mythology. Instead he causes Faust to undergo a long and painful process of reinitiation into the world of the Mothers. In his quest Faust is led by a series of myth- ological figures inhabiting a "Fabelreich" which he enters in a dream and which, as Homunculus puts it, will restore him to life (lines 7054- 55): among these are Helen's mother Leda, whom Faust sees in the dream described by Homunculus (lines 6906 ff.) ; the Sphinxes, im- perturbably enthroned above war and peace (lines 7245 ff.) ; and Man- to, the daughter of Tiresias, who "inwendig triumend" (line 7471) stays in place while time circles around her (line 7481). Although Goethe never finished (or included) the scene in which Faust, as a "second Orpheus" (U, p. 471), visits the realm of Perse- phone ( U, p. 504), the ultimate aim of this descent is clearly prefigured by Faust's previous quest for "the Mothers," in whom creation seems only one step removed from what mystics throughout the world have described as the "void of inexhaustible contents"35 or as "the Cause of 34 Concerning this theme in Goethe's work as a whole see Hans Eichner, "The Eternal Feminine: An Aspect of Goethe's Ethics," in Faust: A Tragedy, ed.

Und ihr verteilt es, allgewaltige Maichte, Zum Zelt des Tages, zum Gew6lb der Nfichte. (lines 6427-34) Even in terms of Indian philosophy this concept of ~i7nyata or the "void of inexhaustible contents" is given a near-perfect formula where Faust, in response to Mephisto's horror tales concerning the frighteningly unutterable nothingness of the Mothers' realm, expresses the hope of finding the All in this nothingness: "In deinem Nichts hoff' ich das All zu finden" (line 6256). Throughout Faust the notion of a feminine source of creation close to the ultimate nothingness is reinforced by allusions to the "breasts [or] springs of all life" (line 456), to "Mother Night" (line 1351), "Mother Earth" (line 7621), the "miracle womb of the depth" (line 8665), or to Rhea, "aller G6tter / Hohe Mutter," (lines 8969-70). The latter, along with Plutarch's mention of certain mother goddesses in the city of En- gyion (U, p. 705), probably provided Goethe with the immediate model for this concept. Its fusion with the notion of an ultimate "void of inex- haustible contents," however, was inspired by different sources. One such source may have been the Indian concept of FSinyata, which in terms of Goethe's development came to reinforce similar notions such as the Cabalistic Ensoph or "Orphic night."37 As early as 1770, Goethe, engrossed in the study of the occult, had formulated a Latin pantheistic credo affirming the ultimate oneness of God and Nature, a belief proba- bly reinforced by the ideas of the influential hermeticist Sincerus Rena- tus, who had described this oneness in such various terms as "the great center of the compass of time and eternity," the "darkness of the abyss," the "eternal stillness," or simply as "nothingness."''38 Compared with Dushmanta's pursuit of Sacontala, Faust's quest is a meandering odyssey involving several guides and digressions. In some of these, other dramcatis personae simultaneously undergo the protago- nist's destiny.

This quest culminates in his transfiguration in Act II, which seems to presage Faust's own ascent into celestial regions. As Homunculus pre- cedes the protagonist by becoming one with the fiery world of Eros, so Euphorion, Faust's own son, parallels the protagonist's quest by enter- ing the dark realm of Persephone in Act III. Moreover, Acts II and III prefigure the last by concluding in paeans of love, life and, more specific- ally, everlasting Nature (line 10089), the Dionysian mysteries (line 10031), and Eros, "who began everything" (line 8479). Kalid~sa's influence, clearly apparent in the general thematic struc- ture of Faust though less so in its episodic digressions, again becomes explicit at these crucial links. As already pointed out, the director's evo- cation of heaven, earth, and the four elements in "Vorspiel auf dem Theater" was probably prompted by the "Prelude" to Sacontalci. The four elements are again evoked at the end of Act II by the chorus "All- Alle" ("Hochgefeiert seid allhier, / Element' ihr alle vier i" lines 8486- 87), and more concretely though indirectly at the end of Act III. Here the chorus describes a scene of thunder, rivers, animals, humans, and divinities precisely prefiguring the final scene of Faust in some of the details in which Sacontaldi's influence on Faust can be demonstrated most convincingly. Just as the developments of Homunculus and Euphorion provide the- matically reinforcing parallels to Faust's, that of a third dramatis per- sona appears as its comical subplot version. In the course of Faust II, Mephisto has turned into an ever more vitriolic misogynist. In one of the funniest scenes of the entire drama, he is distracted from his pursuit of Faust's soul by his homoerotic longings for the rescuing angels. Despite these inclinations, however, he is forced to embrace the feminine prin- ciple and, what is worse, to assume its "negative elementary character""9 by donning the shape of one of the monsters called Phorkyads. While the comical effect provided by this poetic justice is more than obvious, Me- phisto's enforced quest is not without more serious analogues to Faust's. According to a statement Goethe made in angry reaction to the incom- prehension of his readers, Mephisto was even meant to find eventual "Gnad und Erbarmen" before the Lord (U, p. 549). In the play Mephisto's celestial ascent stops short when he feels the pangs of love. Even within this limited scope his development provides colorful contrasts and parallels to Faust's. Thus in Klassische Walpur- gisnacht he at first reacts with fear and confusion before the monsters which fill the protagonist with admiration and wonder. Guided by the 89 See E.

Mephisto's sudden change of attitude and his subsequent delight at the sight of the Phorkyads (line 7993) contain apparently deliberate echoes of the earlier scenes in which Faust stands in respectful wonder before the Sphinxes (lines 7181-82) or, about to descend to the Mothers, describes this "Schaudern" as the best part of man (line 6272). Little wonder, then, that the Phorkyads, as they are gradually revealed to Mephistopheles, share certain aspects with Faust's Mothers. In Mephisto's view they resemble Ops and Rhea (line 7989), while in their own they are Versenkt in Einsamkeit und stillste Nacht . . In Nacht geboren, Ndichtlichem verwandt, Beinah uns selbst, ganz allen unbekannt. (lines 8000, 8010-11) In learning to accept what he previously feared, Mephisto manages to free himself from the hellish superstitions of "monkish barbarism" (U, p. 566) which falsified his true ancestry. By becoming a Phorkyad him- self, he recognizes that instead of being the evil antipode to God he is the "much beloved son of Chaos" (line 8027), and as such an integral part of creation. By expanding the thematic pursuit of the Eternal-Feminine to in- clude its negative elementary character-as in Helen, the Sphinxes, Lamies, Sirens, Phorkyads, and, in a semicomical way, in Mephistophe- les-Phorkyad-Goethe again went beyond Sacontald. He was well aware that Kdlidisa would only have added to the obvious in trying to show that the creative principle as embodied in God's wife, or on a lower level in Sacontala', does not appear in a benign aspect alone. As frequent- ly as he defended the horrific as an integral part of the Faustian world (cf. U, pp. 549, 572-74, etc.), he invoked the inclusiveness of Indian mythology and literature which, he felt, best resolved the conflict be- tween the "most abstruse philosophy on the one hand and the most mon- strous religion on the other" (1W, XII, 301). We find such monstrosity in the description of the god Vishnu in the celebrated eleventh chapter of the Bhagavad Gita (first translated in 1785 by G. Wilkins), or in the goddess who to this day is "the most cherished and widespread of the personalizations of Indian cult." In-, numerable images of Black KIli, better known as Parvati, Siva's wife, depict the "wholly negative aspect of the Universal Mother," for in- stance, in the shape of "an emaciated, gruesome hag of bony fingers, pro- truding teeth, unquenchable hunger [feeding] upon the entrails of her victim" or "adorned with the blood-dripping hands and heads of her 387</page><page sequence="22">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE victims, treading on the prostrate, corpselike body" of her own hus- band.40 Such mythologems express what Goethe, following the model of Shakespeare, had come to believe early in his life, namely that "was wir b6s nennen, ist nur die andre Seite vom Guten" (W, XII, 227). Out- side the work of the English playwright, little in the Western cultural heritage could have helped him incorporate this belief in his poetry. He could, of course, and in fact did, point to the Greek God Mother who, though lacking the chameleon talents of Parvati, shares her ominous role as the destroyer of her husband. But to the consciousness of his time Hesiod's Theogony would have been little closer than the recently discovered myths of India so that Goethe, in an effort to parallel the lat- ter, had to create a series of female mythological figures who would ex- pose Faust to the full duality of nature's life-force and destructiveness. This fearful duality marks the Faustian world even in the highest re- gions of the protagonist's quest. In the service of others, Faust, like Dushmanta, learns to rid himself of his sexual egocentricity or, in Rilke- an terms, to release the beloved. Yet his actions still entail evil, and to the last moments of his life Faust uses the help of the devil or destroys such innocents as Philemon and Baucis. Even Heavenly Love, which comes to meet the questor halfway in his ascent, has little of the one-sided Christian purity which Goethe attributed to it in his famous comment to Eckermann (U, p. 589). Mater Gloriosa, its highest embodiment, seems closer to Parvati than to the Virgin Mary in her orthodox conception. As Mother, Queen, and highest Empress of the world she is, "G6ttern ebenbiirtig" (line 12012), a distinction which, in the very same words, Faust had earlier attributed to the demonic Helena (line 7440). As such, she is able to arouse emotions quite unlike those which Dante's Virgin Mary, for instance, inspires in St. Bernard (Paradiso, xxxiii). Doctor Marianus' prayer, which has been compared with St. Bernard's, is full of the sexual fervor that gives wings to Faust's own invocations of the Eternal-Feminine (lines 12001-04). And what images could be more violent and destructive than those in which Pater Ecstaticus expresses his Gottesminne? Siedender Schmerz der Brust, Schiunumende Gotteslust.

Light- ning and waterfalls, evoked in a similar context in the first scene of Faust II (lines 4716 ff.), provide him with examples: Ist um rmich her ein wildes Brausen, Als wogte Wald und Felsengrund, Und doch stfirzt, liebevoll im Sausen, Die Wasserfiille sich zum Schlund, Berufen, gleich das Tal zu wissern; Der Blitz, der flammend niederschlug, Die Atmosphfire zu verbessern, Die Gift und Dunst im Busen trug- Sind Liebesboten, sie verkiinden, Was ewig schaffend uns umwallt. (lines 11874-81) Yet here we are in the presence of Mary, a realm which in Dante's Di- vina Commedia, for instance, is like the abstract core of a disembodied world of light-suffused crystalline spheres: luce intellettual, piena d'amore; amor di vero ben, pien di letizia; letizia che trascende ogni dolzore.41 What could be further removed from Goethe's earthly paradise of light- ning-ridden clouds, rocks, and thundering waterfalls?42 Yet what is closer to it than Sacontald ? The last scene of Faust II, headed "Berg- schluchten, Wald, Fels, Ein6de. Heilige Anachoreten gebirgauf ver- teilt, gelagert zwischen Kliiften" (line 11843), seems to be closely mod- eled on the conclusion of Sacontald. CHOR und Ecuo: Waldung, sie schwankt heran, Felsen, sie lasten dran, Wurzeln, sie klammern an, Stamm dicht an Starmm hinan. Woge nach Woge spritzt, H6hle, die tiefste, schiitzt. L6wen, sie schleichen stumm- freundlich umrn uns herum, Ehren geweihten Ort, Heiligen Liebeshort. (lines 11844-53) KIliddsa's scenery, too, is a mountainous landscape of rivers, trees, and hermitages, where humans and divines live in perfect harmony with 41 Dante Alighieri, Paradiso XXX.40-42, ed. Mario Marcazzan, Lectura Dantis Scaligera (Florence, 1971), p. 1094. 42 See, by contrast, Hamlin, p. 344: "It seems unquestionable to me that Dante's mystical ascent in the final cantos of the Paradiso provided the model for Faust's salvation." 389</page><page sequence="24">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE nature.43 Lions, which as in Faust are part of that scenery, are cherished by men "as if they were [their] own off-spring" (S, p. 88). And how closely Kalidasa's art of capturing the dynamic life of nature resembles Goethe's ! As Dushmanta exclaims, this mountain wilderness is more delightful than paradise itself . . . clouds pregnant with showers . . . the horses of Indra sparkle with lightning . . . the low lands appear confounded with the high mountain tops; the trees erect their branchy shoulders . . . the rivers look like bright lines, but their waters vanish; and, at this instant, the globe of earth seems thrown upwards by some stupendous power. (S, pp. 86-87) This is what Goethe called "the realms of wonders that hover like fe- cund clouds between heaven and earth" ((W, XII, 301). Here the poet can risk "vulgar and absurd contrasts, which must nevertheless be re- garded as necessary connecting parts of the whole structure" (B, IV, 401-02). Goethe followed Sacontald equally closely in ending his Faust as an "altogether common drama of nature performed by gods and by the children of gods" (W, XII, 301). Like Dushmanta, Faust is raised to heaven to be reunited with his beloved, who in both dramas is described as a penitent practicing her austerities in the presence of the divine: Sacontali as a person in "mnourning apparel," her "celestial face . . . emaciated by the performance of austere duties" (S, pp. 72, 92), eager to rejoin her lost husband; Gretchen as "UNA POENITENTIUM" (line 12068) who, in lines echoing and inverting her prayer to the Virgin Mary toward the end of Faust I (lines 3587 ff.), pleads for her lover (lines 12069-75). Each protagonist is forgiven not only by his beloved but by the gods. As late as about 1825 Goethe had planned to set this final scene, headed "Gericht iiber Faust," in a celestial courtroom pre- sided over by "Christus, Mutter, Evangelisten und alle HI-eilige" (Pro- legomenon 112, U, p. 489). But the model of Kailid~isa's "drama of na- ture, performed by gods and by the children of gods" must have been stronger. As the Lord of the "Prolog im Himmel" was replaced by Mater Gloriosa, so judgment was replaced by exhortation. The Glorious Mother's final verdict is addressed to Gretchen: "Komm! hebe dich zu hohern Sphdiren! / Wenn er dich ahnet, folgt er nach" (lines 12094- 95). Here and in the final lines-"The Eternal-Feminine / Draws us on high"-the central theme of Faust II, which finds a direct parallel in Sacontald, is once more summed up. The closed world of tragedy, of guilt and punishment, sacrifice and redemption, has yielded to an open- ended quest for self-perfection in pursuit of the Great Mothers. 43 The resemblances here seem to be far more striking than those between Faust and the "fourteenth century frescos of the Camposanto in Pisa depicting the Triumph of Death, the Last Judgment, and Hell," which are widely acknowledged as the source of Goethe's heavenly scenario.

Hamlin, pp. 295, 615. 390</page><page sequence="25">FAUST &amp; SACO NTALA Goethe's paradise, like KIlid~sa's, is not a transcendent stellar uni- verse of disembodied perfection, but a world in which we try to perfect and purify ourselves. Both plays suggest this by the notion of teaching and learning. Just as Dushmanta listens to a sage teaching a woman in the divine Ashram (S, p. 88), so Gretchen pleads with Mater Gloriosa to let her teach her beloved (line 12092). Faust will instruct the "blessed boys" (line 12083) who are still aghast at the waterfall (lines 11914 ff.) and must learn the lesson life has taught the protagonist. The quest for self-perfection does not imply an escape from life but a deeper immersion in it. It means learning to accept life in its fearsome duality of creation and destruction without trying to subsume it under any technological, moral, anthropomorphic, redemptive, or tragic scheme. The basic pat- tern of this process is that of death and rebirth. Kdliddsa, with his well- defined Vedantic belief in karma, reincarnation, and final salvation from rebirth, is somewhat more explicit here than Goethe. After being re- united with his wife and son, the king returns to rule as the better man he has become through his quest. Although in all his future endeavors the final aim will be the nirvdna invoked in the play's last line, this goal, as we see from the god Casyapa's blessing upon the king's departure, is still remote. Casyapa: Henceforth may the god of the atmosphere with copious rain give abundance to thy affectionate subjects; and mayst thou with frequent sacrifices maintain the Thunderer's friendship I By numberless inter- changes of good offices between you both, may benefits reciprocally be conferred on the inhabitants of the two worlds . . Dushmanta: . .. and may Siva . . . eternally potent and self-existing, avert from me the pain of another birth in this perishable world. (S, p. 98) Arising from a world of tragedy, the ending of Faust is less unde- viatingly happy than this one, and there is no explicit statement that Faust, like Dushmanta, will travel through endless reincarnations to- ward nirvdna. Gretchen has killed Faust's child, and both Gretchen and Faust have suffered real deaths. But in the earthly paradise they have reached, Faust will be the teacher of the "selige Knaben" (line 12083) and Gretchen, about to observe Faust's coming back to life (lines 12084 ff.), anticipates her happiness at being reunited with her lover. The rest of their journey is hinted at in the concluding lines of the play, spoken by the CHORUS MYSTICUS: Alles Vergiingliche Ist nur ein Gleichnis; Das Unzuliingliche, Hier wird's Ereignis; Das Ewig-Weibliche Zieht uns hinan.
