CLAUDIA MURPHY STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW VORK AT ALBANY This very important contribution to the philosophy of biology develops two central theses. First Kitcher thoroughly debunks most of what has been written on human sociobiology. Second Kitcher argues that there is nevertheless room for the development of what he calls "a careful sociobiological research programme. Kitcher gives a very detailed and thorough critique of what he calls pop sociobiology. Kitcher's main lines of argument fall into two kinds. First, he gives many detailed critical analyses of particular sociobiological explanations, and in each case he attempts to show the errors in these</page><page sequence="2">480 NOUS explanations. Second he argues that pop sociobiologists are very simplistic in the manner in which they appeal to the theory of evolution. Pop sociobiology emerged in the midl970's with the publication of E. 0. Wilson's Sociobiology: the New Synthesis. Wilson defined "sociobiology" as the systematic study of the biological basis for behavior. More general- ly the idea is that behavior is also a property of phenotypes and hence can be given an evolutionary explanation. The theory has both its ad- vocates and its critics and in fact stirs an amazing amount of controversy especially when applied to human social behavior. The chief accomplish- ment of Kitcher's book is to lay that controversy to rest, and in a very comprehensive manner. He not only critically discusses Wilson, but also many others working in the field, including Alexander, Barash, Dawkins, Lumsden and Wilson, Trivers, et. al. Kitcher gives a very sympathetic portrayal of Wilson's argument. Although many of the early critics seemed to be attacking a strawman, Kitcher is not guilty of doing so. Pop sociobiology, according to Kitcher, is committed to the following type of argument: 1. All members of a cer- tain group would maximize their fitness by exhibiting a certain behavior in the typical environments encountered by this group. 2. When we find this behavior in all of the members of the group, we can conclude that the behavior became prevalent and remains prevalent through natural selec- tion. 3. Because selection can only act where there are genetic differences, we can conclude that there are genetic differences between members of the group and those ancestors who did not display the behavior. 4. Because there are genetic differences and because the behavior is adaptive, we can show that it will be difficult to modify the behavior by altering the social environment. Kitcher calls this argument Wilson's ladder. Kitcher continues by exposing assumptions and mistakes that run through the entire argument. He is criticizing what he calls "pop sociobiologists." He seems to have in mind those sociobiologists who make sweeping claims about a biological basis for human social behavior. Kit- cher begins by pointing out that the situation is much more complicated than Wilson and his followers would have us believe. In fact he accuses pop sociobiologists of arguing that simply because a certain evolutionary history is possible, that it is in fact actual. No evolutionary theorist should make such a mistake. Several alternative evolutionary histories need to be articulated, and then an argument must be given for preferring one of them. i Kitcher also points out that there are several problems with the descrip- tions of behavior that pop sociobiologists offer. He rightly accuses them of an extreme anthropomorphism. Pop sociobiologists see scorpion flies and mallard ducks committing rape, for example. (Barash, 1979). In general pop sociobiologists take phrases which are descriptive of human behavior and apply them to the plant and animal kingdoms. If they were very careful to redefine these terms, such a procedure might not be a prob- lem. But Kitcher persuasively argues that they fail to do so, and these loose definitions make the inference to human behavior much more com- pelling. In addition, Kitcher argues that it is almost never clear that any</page><page sequence="3">KITCHER'S AMBITION 481 given description is warranted. The dominant male lion might also be described as being tolerated by a pride of females, for example. Finally and most importantly, Kitcher develops a difficulty which does not belong to sociobiology alone. A problem for any student of behavior is to articu- late criteria for individuating behavior. What counts as a piece of behavior and how is behavior to be classified into kinds? Finally, Kitcher raises some very difficult questions at the heart of evolutionary theory. He points out that pop sociobiologists look at behavior in an atomistic manner, trying to show that such behavior is adaptive. Yet he argues that sometimes selection favors less than optimal alleles in genetic systems which involve more than one locus. The reason for this is that interaction effects among the loci can interfere with setting the fittest pair at any locus. Second, Kitcher argues that pop sociobiological accounts are too simplistic, for they fail to acknowledge that chance events shape the path of evolution. Finally he argues that some traits may be neutral with respect to selection. Although this point is extremely controversial, Kitcher argues that the empirical evidence has not decided the point in the favor of pop sociobiologists. In fact, to decide the issue we need to understand the genetic and developmental basis of the trait in question. Overall, Kitcher's book is quite enjoyable. He has done an excellent job of showing that there is no solid basis for any of the indiscriminate claims about human sociobiology. The biggest disappointment of the book is that Kitcher does not have a sustained discussion of the nature-nurture controversy nor does he develop what he calls "a careful sociobiological research program". A discussion of the nature-nuture controversy is in the book but only in a piecemeal and disjointed fashion. Early in the book he claims that genes are protein builders and that the extrapolation from genes to behavior is not understood. There is a very complex causal pathway involving complicated interactions. So the environment is going to be important in producing the behavior. Kitcher also raises the very important question about what variations in behavior could be produced given different environments. This is the kind of research that needs to be done. Some developmental, behavioral psychologists have carried the nature- nuture discussion much further. Gilbert Gottlieb, (1983) argues that there are two very different conceptions of interaction or epigenesis that are operative in evolutionary circles. The first he titles predetermined epigenesis. This is a conception of development that involves unidirec- tional causation. The genes cause development of a central nervous system which then in turn is responsible for the behavior of the organism. The environment acts as a passive stimulant, in that the nervous system develops in an encapsulated fashion. Gottlieb thinks that various biologists have been committed to predetermined epigenesis including Konrad Lorenz, (1965), Ernst Mayr (1974) and Lumsden and Wilson (1981, 1983). Probablistic epigenesis, on the other hand, is a view of epigenesis that is genuinely interactionist. The behavior of the organism not only facilitates the development of the central nervous system, but actually induces further development. The causation is bidirectional. There are three ways in which</page><page sequence="4">482 NOUS experience causes the development of species-typical behavior. The first role of experience is that the behavior maintains the structurally matured central nervous system. Sensory deprivation experiments during neonatal development can lead to decomposition of neural tissue. The second role of experience in contributing to development of behavior is that experience facilitates, i.e. temporally accelerates, developmental accomplishment. The basic idea is that the behavior would eventually emerge even in the absence of the experience. The third role of experience in causing the develop- ment of behavior is the most controversial. Gottlieb postulates that it is probable that experience induces development of the central nervous system and of behavior; Gottlieb challenges the assumption that traits and behavior with which an individual is born are innate. For example researchers have claimed that since human infants immediately know how to suck, that sucking is an innate behavior. Gottlieb points out that such an explanation overlooks the fact that for the most part fetal environments are invariant. In fact he postulates that most organisms enjoy genetic pluripotency. Any one genotype is sufficiently plastic so as to develop into structurally and behaviorally different phenotypes. The consequences for sociobiology could be staggering. We have very little empirical evidence with which to answer Kitcher's question about the effects of environmental variations. We know evenf less about the effect of the manipulation of the fetal environment. It seems as if there is even less reason than Kitcher would have us believe to accept the last step of Wilson's ladder. These kinds of explanations not only promise a new rich interdisciplinary research program but also they could have very, very interesting social and political implications. REFERENCES Alexander, R.
