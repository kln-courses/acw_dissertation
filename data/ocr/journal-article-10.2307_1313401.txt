<plain_text><page sequence="1">MAKING LIVES RICHER AND BETTER Second Nature: Environmental En- richment for Captive Animals. David J. Shepherdson, Jill D. Mellon, and Michael Hutchins, eds. Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington, DC, 1998. 347 pp., illus. $32.50 (ISBN 1-56098-745-6 cloth). Second Nature is a gold mine of information for those who want to enrich the lives of the numerous non- human animals (hereafter referred to simply as animals) who are held in captivity for one of any number of reasons (e.g., eventual reintroduc- tion to the wild, research, entertain- ment, amusement, or food). Its goal is "to provide an overview of the evolving art and science of environ- mental enrichment and to define and expand upon its theoretical frame- work as well as its practical appli- cations"(p. 334). The book deals mainly with ani- mals who are maintained in zoos and aquaria and considers numerous ver- tebrate taxa. The editors are leaders in the field, and the 38 contributors represent an all-star cast. Second Nature has three main sections- "Theoretical Bases of Environmen- tal Enrichment"; "Environmental Enrichment in Animal Conservation and Welfare"; "Environmental En- richment in Captive Management, Husbandry, and Training"-and 19 chapters. Nearly all of the contribu- tions emphasize practical, real-world applications of environmental enrich- ment and the primacy of empirical data over anecdotes and common sense (e.g., folk views that bigger cages translate into happier animals and better lives). Clearly, if animals are to be kept in captivity, it is essential that re- searchers make serious attempts to improve the situation. As Donald Lindburg reminds the reader, "The history of animal-keeping is a sober- ing reminder of the ease with which quality living can be denied to even the most sentient and developmen- tally sensitive animals"(p. 262). Al- though the topic of environmental enrichment presupposes that animals will be kept in captivity, restricting their freedom and compromising other aspects of their lives raise many difficult and contentious issues that have been hotly debated by research- ers, including zoologists, psycholo- gists, and philosophers (see Jamieson 1995, Bekoff 1998, and discussions in this volume). What does "environmental enrich- ment" mean? There is no single de- finitive definition, but the heart of the idea of enrichment centers on increasing an animal's psychological well-being, or quality of life, as man- dated in a 1985 amendment to the Animal Welfare Act of 1966 (Terry 1998). Animals whose psychologi- cal well-being is maximized not only appear to be more content than those whose well-being is compromised but also make for better research be- cause data from stressed animals might not be reliable. How is psychological well-being measured? Once again, there is no single answer, but the contributors to Second Nature and others gener- ally agree that animals who are in good psychological health do not engage in behaviors such as repeti- tive and stereotyped pacing, self- mutilation, and rocking back and forth. They also do not show unusu- ally high levels of fear and aggression. They do, however, engage in various types of play, have good appetites, and do not suffer from abnormally high levels of stress, anxiety, or dis- ease. Normal, species-typical behav- ior patterns that occur at unusually high or low rates or altered activity cycles can also indicate poor psycho- logical health. There are also physi- ological assays for stress, such as measuring levels of urinary cortico- steroids (urine is easy to collect un- obtrusively). Simply put, psychologi- cally content animals do not look or act as if they are bored. Rather, they look and behave as if they are experi- encing feelings of pleasure, enjoyment, and satisfaction (DeGrazia 1996). Needless to say, although empiri- cal data may trump humans' subjec- tive impressions of nonhuman well- being, there is an inevitable subjective (anthropomorphic and anthropocen- tric) component of the assessment of psychological well-being. Compara- tive studies of animal cognition (Allen and Bekoff 1997) allow access into animal minds, where mental states of well-being reside. Attempts to abandon any subjective impressions, however minor, are likely to provide incomplete accounts of well-being. Studies of diverse animals and their species-typical sensory and motor worlds can help those who work with animals to recognize, as do many of the contributors, that animals dis- play individual differences that need to be considered in any enrichment program. It is difficult to summarize all types of enrichment that have been used or have been reviewed in Second Na- ture. Different species have different needs, and there are individual dif- ferences within a species (e.g., age and gender may influence what works). The main goal of enrich- ment programs centers on giving animals more control of their lives and having them work to occupy their time with species-appropriate or other activities. Animals' lives can be enriched in numerous ways, in- cluding providing safe and secure refuges for rest, sleep, and escape from unwanted intrusions by cage mates and humans; allowing indi- viduals of social species to live in pairs or larger groups that resemble natural groups; making them work for meals by providing frozen food or by scattering or hiding it; provid- ing natural substrates; spraying odors in cages; allowing or facilitating ex- ercise; providing large cages (al- though large cages are not always enriching); and increasing the com- plexity or diversity of their social and physical environments. Moder- ate levels of stress that tax the ani- mals might also be beneficial, espe- cially for individuals who are to be reintroduced to the wild. The notions of species-typical be- havior and needs are discussed sev- eral times in the book. Captive ani- 854 BioScience Vol. 48 No. 10</page><page sequence="2">mals are often compared with wild conspecifics to see how captivity changes an animal's life. Trevor Poole (chapter 6) challenges the view that the wild is the ideal state for an animal, noting that wild animals suf- fer from diseases, injuries, starva- tion, predation, and abusive intru- sion by humans. This concept has been hotly debated in the field. For my part, I believe that claiming that what humans provide for captive animals is better than what nature provides leans too far to the side of anthropocentric control and management. Animals evolved in nature, and this fact should be respected. It is all too easy to claim that because life is tough "out there," we are really doing animals a favor by keeping them "in here" and trying to enrich their impoverished lives. As long as animals are held in captivity, we are obligated to treat them with respect and to make their lives as good as can be. Environmen- tal enrichment is one way to accom- plish this goal. It is a privilege to study other animals, and captive animals have a right to such treat- ment. I disagree with the editors' claim that "animals whose lives are enriched represent true ambassadors for their species"(p. 334). I believe that the true ambassadors for any species, those representatives who should be used as models, are wild individuals of that species. Having said this, let me also say that Second Nature is an excellent book and a must read, because it is unlikely that captive animals will become extinct in the near future or even in our lifetime.
