Many have looked at the device of the French Republic without realizing that its motto, Libert?, Egalit?, Fraternit?, is a most complete definition of democracy. It was framed by the French Revolution, and has therefore, especially in this country, often been misunderstood. The word of fundamental im portance is ?galit?. The French Revolution gave forth many odd opinions, but it did not affirm that all men were .?equally endowed and deserving of equal con sideration in all respects ; on the contrary, it declared that it was to men of talent careers were open. By the word ?galit? it meant essentially that every man had the same rights before the law. By libert? it meant that a man was free to gang his ain gate so long as he did not offend the rules made by the community to which he belonged, and that a demo cratic constitution must ensure that he has had his share in the making of the rules. By fraternit? is to be understood something more than recog nition that others of the same nation have equal rights. As Mr. Belloc has well put it, "the com munity cannot express authority unless it possesses corporate initiative: that is, unless the mass of its component units are able to combine for the purpose of a common expression, are conscious of a common will." The means of getting this common expression has always been the difficulty of democracy. In practice the only method hitherto employed has been the representative system, subject to various controls of greater or less stringency and efficiency. In theory the system fulfils the condition of ?galit?, but in practice it often falls short either because, as usually happens, it is badly contrived, or because the individual members of the community do not recognize the obligations to vote, or on both accounts. With the anthropomorphism out of which the most of mankind has not yet grown, they imagine a Person which they call the State or the Government, and to it they address their supplications, on it rest their hopes and fears, and on it vent their dissatisfaction. As M. Clemenceau has said, with his customary brevity and conciseness : " How great is the illusion which leads a man to belisve that responsibility attaches to the Government alone. In a democracy the responsibility attaches to every citizen. The people are responsible for the parliamentary majority." We may go a little further with M. Clemenceau. Though an individualist, he gave currency to the use of the word bloc to express the fundamental democratic idea that the citizen, while he is under an obligation to endeavour to make his opinions prevail, is yet under a corresponding obligation, if he fails to convince the majority, to sink his personal aspira tions in the common will. He may work to alter the decision ; he may seek also to change an imperfect method of obtaining a decision, and as the methods of election to Parliament in France and in this country are faulty, he may indeed believe it to be his. duty to do so. That the decision must be loyally accepted while it is in force even by those who believe it mistaken, is a hard saying, but in large matters of peace and war we all admit its truth. If we do not act on this principle we fall, in another of M. Clemenceau's biting phrases, on " incoherence.*' It is of this incoherence that the medical profession in this country is in peril. The Medical Secretary of the British Medical Association has done well in the first part of his address published in the Supplement this week te tell the profession some elementary truths about democratic ideals and methods; he uses more word* than M. Clemenceau, but he means the same thing. The later part of his address was devoted to a con sideration of the reasons given for discontent with the British Medical Association. As to the first allegation?that the Association is not active enough ?we entirely agree that it can only be made by a person who has not taken the trouble to understand what it does. The other complaint?that its organiza tion is defective because it is not registered as a trade union?has often been made in recent times, and during the last two or three years the propaganda of the Medico-Political Union (an organization of medical men registered under the Trade Union Acts) has increased the number of believers in this doctrine. The matter was gone into fully, with legal assist ance, by this Journal in 1913. Ifc was approached under the impression that the Trade Union Acts, in spite of their title?for it generally turns out that an Act does more or less than Parliament intended?would be found to apply to a medical union, and that the question for decision would be whether the sacrifice of members which the acceptance of trade unionism would unquestionably entail, ought to be faced to ensure greater safety and efficiency. The conclusion was therefore unexpected. It was, as stated in the Journal of April 5th, 1913, that the strength of trade unionism lies not in forms or laws, or in any immunity from legal process, but in the union and solidarity it has bred, making it possible to obtain obedience and bring about a strike if necessary. No one has yet shown how the medical profession could use the strike weapon even if the majority were willing to use it. The matter has now been gone into again by the British Medical Association, with the assistance of lawyers specially conversant with trade union law. The upshot is given by Dr. Gox, and shows upon what a shaky foundation the Medico - Political Union has built up the fa?ade it presents to the profession. The advantages claimed for trade union organiza tion of the medical profession seem now to be reduced to two : one is that the funds of a medical trade union would enjoy the protection offered by the Trade Disputes Act of 1906. The legal opinion, as we understand it, is that in the first place a medical man is not a workman, nor a master, within the meaning of the Act ; and that if the Trade Disputes Act was nevertheless held to apply, the funds of the union would indeed be protected, but the action would lie against individuals, whether officials or ordinary members of the union. The lawyers express the opinion that little or no advantage would be derived from registration as a trade union in a case in which claims similar to those raised in the Coventry case were again raised. Incidentally they state that a trade union has not the benefit of limited liability which a registered company?the legal status of the British Medical Association?has. The other ad vantage a medical trade union is alleged to possess over a body constituted as is the British Medical Association is that it would4 be able* to joint the Labour Party ; but apparently any voluntary medical</page><page sequence="2">MARCH 22, igioj THE FOOD REQUIREMENTS or MAtf. [m^SIT *^ 349 organization can join the Labour Party, if it so desires, under the category of " brain workers." The fact is that the doctrine that registration under the Trade Union Acts would increase the powers or immunities of a medical organization appears, so soon as it is carefully and impartially examined, to be a delusion. There are three possible ways of producing a combination of persons having a cor porate existence in the eye of the law and enjoying a legal status : it may obtain a charter from the Crown, it may become registered under the Companies Acts (as the British Medical Association is), or under the Trade Union Acts. The whole point is whether there is greater protection by registration under the latter than under the former Acts, and, as we have said, we believe the answer must be in the negative. There is no magic in the term trade union. Here, as is customary in all matters, but especially in legal makers, everything depends on the definition of the meaning of the words used. It seems a pity that able and energetic members of the Medico-Political Union should waste their time pursuing a will-o'-the-wisp. l We may feel this all the more because, though a better statement of the aims and objects of a com prehensive medical association could not easily be framed than is contained in the Memorandum of the British Medical Association, it would be rash to assert that its constitution is free from imperfection. Each reorganization of the Association has been designed to make its constitution conform more closely to the true democratic ideal, and to adapt' it to the increase in the number of its members. On the whole the story is one of steady progress, but the present constitution, however excellent the intentions of its framers, has certain defects, obvious to any one who takes the trouble to understand the essential principles of democratic organization. In every body of ardent reformers there have always been doctrinaires who made more noise and thus exerted more influence than their numbers or the weight of their arguments warranted. Two defects which might easily have been avoided are to be ob served in the present constitution of the Associa tion. The idea of having small units possesses great advantages ; that no one doubts. But the mistake was committed of making these small units constituencies for the election of representatives. The mistake may be excused, because a similar method is used for the election of the House of Commons, yielding results so glaringly false that no responsible statesman can be found any longer to defend it. The other defect may be traced to the fact that i certain active members of the Committee which drafted the new constitution of the Association were enamoured of the idea embodied in the word f&lt; delegate "?that is, a person who in an assembly is the mouthpiece of the words, not of the ideas, of his constituents. This proposal had to be dropped, but the underlying idea was embodied in the doctrine of the " instructed vote "?that a member, unless he attended a meeting at some appointed place in his Division on an appointed day at an appointed hour, should not have the right to vote in the choice of his representative, or have any other opportunity of expressing his opinion except by writing a letter to the Journal, which is a work of supererogation having no constitutional force. Is there any man who knows anything about the history of the development of the parliamentary franchise in this country or anything of what it is to-day, who will pretend that it would be possible to apply such a system to the election of members of Parliament ? Is it conceivable that a man should be deprived of the right to vote for | his representative, the only definite point at which he shares in the government of his country, because lie had not attended a stated meeting at which lie was instructed by the candidates, or instructed them ? It is true, as the Council recently pointed out, that this defect is mitigated by a rule which gives power to a constituency to make use of the postal vote. Many believe that in the best interests of the Association and.the profession the alternative?the vote in person ?ought no longer anywhere to be insisted on.</page></plain_text>
