Its role in the Stoic account of psycho- moral development has long been recognized and is given due attention in every decent textbook. Yet, as Engberg-Pedersen's new book reminds us, scholars are still divided on its exact role and status. In his preface, E. voices strong doubts as to a number of trends in current research (pp. 7ff.). Since he considers it on the ?. K.J.

But E. is not instigating a revisionist approach?in fact, there is a distinctly iconoclastic quality about his project. Pohlenz did not go very far in determining the logical content and systematic function of ???e??s??. This was undertaken in more recent studies, most of which set the concept firmly in the context of Stoic determinism and divine providence3). Here too E. strikes a note of dissent. His second aim is to show that the Stoics located the foundation of ethics not in teleology and pantheism but rather in the proper functioning of reason. These concerns determine the overall structure of this wide- ranging book, which falls into two main parts, the first offering a 'non-teleologica!' interpretation of ???e??s?? (chs. I-V), the second dealing with a number of other Stoic key-concepts and doctrines in such a way as to bring out their dependence on ???e??s??: proper actions (?a?????ta), the cognitive nature of virtue, impulse (????) and the passions as well as freedom and determinism (chs. VI-IX). Most of E.'s original perceptions are to be found in the first part, on which I will concentrate in what follows. Starting from the concepts of the end (t????) and happiness (e?da?????a), E. considers the Stoic position in the light of Aristotelian ethics (ch. I). Put in a somewhat oversimplifying way, he argues that Aristotle, in developing his view on the t????, was not interested in the substantive content of ordinary people's notions, stressing the need for education instead (pp. 18ff.)4). This left a gap between the many subjective conceptions of happiness and the single objective one, i.e. the t?????a gap which the Stoics sought to fill up through their doctrine of ???e??s??. For they, unlike Aristotle, addressed their philosophy to all-comers and so were more apt to integrate common notions into their theory. But they remained within an essentially Aristotelian framework insofar as ???e??s?? is concerned with practicad thought. From this E. develops his thesis about the foundation of Stoic ethics: it is man himself who bestows value on things as the result of a mental process starting from non-normative self-perception (e.g. pp. 40, 48, 61 ff.). The concept of nature (f?s??) is fairly marginal to Aristotelian ethics while featuring prominently in the moral theories of most Hellenistic schools. In the case of the Stoics, the simplest way to illustrate this shift is by pointing to their t????-formula 'living in</page><page sequence="3">228 DE NOVIS LIBRIS IUDICIA agreement with nature' in its various versions. But, naturally enough, any strongly Aristotelian reading of Stoic ethics will tend to treat nature as a 'weak' concept5). Thus E. restricts the concept to human nature and strips it of the normative value which most interpreters believe our sources ascribe to it. He has not much to say on the doctrinal and methodological aspects involved in arguing Aristotelian influence. But 'philosophically minded commentators' have convinced him that this approach is quite promising: "... it seems obvious ... that the basic conceptual moves in Stoic philoso- phy make particularly good sense when seen precisely as ways of addressing and responding to Aristotelian positions and issues" (p. 18)6). This rather sweeping position has profound consequences for his general procedure. In the second chapter, E. turns to one of the loci classici on ???e??s??, D.L. 7.85-89, whose credentials as testimony on early Stoic doctrines are clear from references to Chrysippus' ?e?? te???. Here Nature is presented as a benevolent rational agent establishing the values for man. This of course goes against E.'s thesis that the t???? was grounded from within practical thought (cf. p. 48). What he embarks upon can best be described as a protracted excercise in mystification: what seems obvious is in fact obscure and uncertain. To convey this impression, he resorts to such tactics as detracting from the quality of the source (pp. 36, 38) and reduc- ing the references to universali Nature to little more than a. fa?on de parler: "... the emphasis will have been on what it is our nature to do in spite of the fact that this point has been concealed in language that speaks of ... universal Nature" (p. 48, E.'s italics). A similar treatment befalls two verbatim fragments where Chrysippus une- quivocally locates the foundation of morality in universal Nature or Zeus and designates theology (a part of physics) as the starting point of ethics (SVF III 68, 326): "Nothing of this is immediately clear and the whole area is brimming with difficulties" (p. 59)7). Understandably, he has to work hard to toe his own line. Too hard: "If we had no other text for Stoic ethics than D.L. 7.85-89, there is no doubt that we should settle for the ideological and func- tionalist, basically objective reading" (p. 46f.). Of course. How- ever sketchy and concise in some respects, Diogenes' account is clear enough on the point at issue here. The trouble is that E. believes another source, Cicero, does tell in favour of a 'subjective', non-teleologica! interpretation. In chs. III-IV, E. discusses Cicero's account of ???e??s?? at Fin.</page><page sequence="4">DE NOVIS LIBRIS IUDICIA 229 3.16ff. One axe he has to grind concerns its argumentative status. Drawing on a 1986 article8), he argues against Striker (see n. 1) that Cicero presents a proper argument for the Stoic t???? rather than a psychological account (pp. 82ff.). To drive this point home, he offers a detailed analysis designed to explicate the succesive steps of this argument (pp. 66ff.). The passage does emerge with a reasonably coherent train of thought, though one may feel that E.'s elaborate distinctions put too much strain on Cicero's concise account. A degree of indeterminacy may be due to Cicero's specific aims and methods?which should prompt us to keep a close eye on other sources as well. E. places much emphasis on the interplay between the subjective and the objective. Although Cicero may switch frantically back and forth between these two perspectives, his approach in crucial sec- tions such as Fin. 3.16ff. is predominantly subjective, whereas Diogenes presents an objective 'version'. E. regards the subjective point of view, which turns on the idea of the individual seeing cer- tain things about himself, as primary. The objective references to nature are derivative; they serve two functions in relation to the subjective version. First, they formulate briskly and directly what the upshot is of a case of ???e??s?? in the subjective sense; for exam- ple, when health is said to be in accordance with nature, the main point is that this results from an animal's self-awareness and self- love. Secondly, objective references to cosmic nature as setting up the goals of human action express the idea that man's view of himself is correct. But, E. stresses, this point is an epistemologica! one and the reference to nature has no evaluative import (p. 78f.). E. isolates and radicalizes a point made by A.A. Long, namely that it is possible to gloss Chrysippus' proposition about a divine world government by reference to what Long calls 'the community of reason' (p. 39f.). In other words, ???e??s?? is primarily concerned with human nature as an internal teleological principle, a 'voice of reason'. Given Stoic natural theology, this does not imply an opposition between external and internal as far as the criterion of goodness is concerned9). But unlike Long, E. does play off the internal and external perspectives against one another, condemn- ing the latter to a somewhat shadowy existence as an objective ver- sion of the basic, subjective one. If correctly applied, the subjective/objective distinction can be illuminating. It helps explain the acquisition of a proper moral view of the value of things when the t???? is reached (cf. pp. 9Iff.). But</page><page sequence="5">230 DE NOVIS LIBRIS IUDICIA E. should have studied more closely the terms in which the Stoics themselves conceived of the two perspectives involved, most notably universal and individual nature. According to Diogenes, Chrysippus said that the human t???? consists in achieving agree- ment between one's individual nature and cosmic nature or God, man being part of the whole (7.87-88). For all his attention to tex- tual minutiae, E. sidesteps the part-and-whole idea, which wrecks his subjective/objective distinction (cf. p. 39; and Cic. Fin. 3.64 with p. 125). Only in the final chapter does it play some part in relation to Fate, or so it seems (pp. 215ff.). But here too it has nothing to do with ???e??s??, which is connected to determinism only insofar as it enables people to reach an objective under- standing of the world (pp. 23Iff.). Stoic theology?the crowning science according to Chrysippus (SVFII 42)?is perfunctorily sket- ched at the outset (p. 208) and forgotten in what follows. In fact, E.'s whole book suffers from an anti-theological bias (cf. also n. 7). To add one painfully clear example, there is E.'s polemic against Inwood concerning the Stoic view of passions as contravening 'right reason' (pp. 185ff.). Inwood associates 'right reason' with Zeus and the Common Law in view of their identification at D.L. 7.8810). Without addressing the textual evidence, E. declares he cannot see why the Stoics needed the appeal to God to produce an argument for their view of the passions. There is a touch of tragic irony in his concluding remark: "But we should ask: exactly where and exactly to what purpose did the Stoics bring in God (Zeus) as something that sets up a norm?" (p. 185). One could not agree more. E.'s failure to appreciate theological aspects throws an awkward light on his clarion call to treat the Stoics in a 'sympathetic' manner (just as anyone, he says, will be sympathetic to Plato and Aristotle, p. 10)11). His own brand of sympathy is so strong as to make him suppress several things he does not sympathize with. The tool used for the purpose is his version of the subjective/objective distinction, which rests on certain preconceptions about what philosophy is, or should be: "The Stoic theory is in another [way] less clearly so [ideological] when considered at the level which matters, the philosophical one" (p. 61). This nicely epitomizes the attitude E. brings to the study of Stoic thought. E.'s view of 'teleological' passages as encoded epistemological statements is quite implausible. As he fails to produce any real tex- tual support, it is also unfounded. At the same time, references to</page><page sequence="6">DE NOVIS LIBRIS IUDICIA 231 nature keep propping up with unrelenting frequency?only to be dismissed as a particular 'vocabulary', rhetorical flourishes or metaphors (e.g. pp. 48, 60, 78f., 82, 185). Even Cicero lapses into 'crudely ideological language' (p. 249 n. 18). The motivation behind this ideological dress-up is never properly explained. The first part of the book concentrates heavily on Cicero?so much so that it can almost be read as a running commentary on Fin. 3. Now it is true that Cicero's concern is more with the individual and his approach more empirical and less theological than, notably, Diogenes'. In important passages such as Fin. 3.16, nature is not explicitly mentioned (but cf. Fin. 3.17). What explains this difference between the two sources? E. does not tell us. But it is worth noting that Cicero reflects the teaching of his mentor Antiochus of Ascalon, who saw the Stoics as contributing to a unitary tradition starting from the old Academy and Peripatos. This perspective entails a concentration on the apportionment of the valuables vis-?-vis the t????: within the traditional scheme, the Stoics differ from the other schools in that they make the summum bonum consist solely of moral virtue, excluding the bodily and exter- nal 'goods'. Here, then, lies Cicero' focus of interest, not with nature. But even so, his account is compatible with Diogenes' and arguably confirms the latter's treatment of nature's role (cf. the passives commendari, conciliari, alienari, Fin. 3.16L). In short, Diogenes' account should be used to evaluate Cicero's instead of being emasculated in the light of an uncompelling interpretation of the latter. As it is, E.'s overemphasis on Cicero has caused him to prolong the interpretano Antiochea of early Hellenistic ethics. Yet we would be mistaken in supposing that E.'s handling of the sources is of an unthinking kind. He points to the fragmentary and variegated nature of the evidence. But then, given the Stoics' view of their philosophy as a system, "it becomes tempting [...] to bring in as much of the transmitted evidence as is at all possible and to see the success of the enterprise in the extent to which it can point to 'systematic' connections, almost no matter which, between the various items that are stitched together. This temptation should be resisted, however [...]. The aim of the interpreter should be to focus on a single, and hopefully central, issue and let that issue determine what material should be included in the treatment and what excluded, which systematic connections should be deemed relevant and which irrelevant. " (p. 8, E.'s italics). Thus scholars who relate Stoic ethics to the ideological, pantheistic image of Nature are "overstepping</page><page sequence="7">232 DE NOVIS LIBRIS IUDICIA the limits which the Stoics themselves were keen to maintain ..." (ibid.). One could hardly fail to recall keen Chrysippus' ipsissima verba in SVF III 68 and 326 (see above). E.'s restrictive method also extends to the use of sources12). We should not "move more or less elegantly" (p. 9) from one text to another but rather exploit the opportunities offered by larger and "more reasoned" texts; hence the preference for Cicero (pp. 16f., 122). However, it is one thing to undertake a detailed analysis of a text of this type and see where this leads; it is quite another to assign to it absolute primacy over other sources regardless of the historical relations involved. This is of course a truism in the study of early Stoicism, and it is distressing that it needs to be argued. In practice, to be sure, E. cannot help moving more or less elegantly between Cicero and other sources and overstepping limits himself. Thus in discussing Cicero, Fin. 3.16ff. he implausibly adduces linguistic doctrines from elsewhere (pp. 88ff.). And relying on a single Ciceronian passage (Ac. II 21), he argues that the fa?tas?a ?ata??pt??? has nothing to do with epistemic certainty but represents a stage in ???e??s?? with an altogether different point. That the concept belongs in the debate between Stoics and Academics, he asserts, is an impression falsely conveyed by the sources (pp. 143, 160). What are we to conclude? I have concentrated on certain fun- damental issues, viz. E.'s one-sided Aristotelizing view of Stoic ethics and his Procrustean treatment of the sources, which vitiate his whole approach from the start. To be fair, his book offers many suggestive discussions of detail to which it is impossible to do full justice in a single review. In short, it should be used with caution. Further, it must be said that this is not a work for the beginner, for the undisciplined, or for the faint-hearted. The complexity of E.'s lucubrations often gives the reader pause. This effect is increased by certain infelicities of style such as an inclination to verbosity and a fondness for parentheses and italics?devices which are meant to bring out subtleties of argument but which through sheer abun- dance soon become devalued and wearisome. It is somewhat ironic that E.'s Aristotelian reading of Stoic ???e??s?? was in certain ways anticipated in antiquity. Cicero, Fin. bk. 5 and Arius Didymus ap. Stobaeus, Eel. II pp. 116.2-128.9 Wachsmuth present very similar accounts of Peripatetic ethics featuring an adapted version of ???e??s??. E. does not undertake to explain how these accounts relate to Stoicism and to one another.</page><page sequence="8">DE NOVIS LIBRIS IUDICIA 233 Yet these questions have been controversial ever since Madvig drew attention to their resemblance and postulated Antiochus of Ascalon as their common source13). Many other solutions ensued, often in relation to the question of the ultimate origin of the doc- trine of ???e??s??. After all, it need not be taken for granted that the sources of Arius and Cicero are late Hellenistic. Dirlmeier did much to detail the Academic and early Peripatetic prehistory of the doc- trine, although he certainly went too far in pinpointing Theophrastus as its author14). Pohlenz discussed correspondences with Stoic material which proved more convincing than Dirlmeier's because they concerned doctrinal, not merely terminological points15). Today ???e??s?? is generally believed to be Stoic in origin, though Pohlenz's position has been qualified, e.g. by those who submit that so-called 'social ???e??s??' is a Peripatetic importation, in line with their impression that it does not fit neatly onto 'personal ???e??s??' as described at e.g. D.L. 7.85ff. and Cic, Fin. 3.16ff. Giuseppina Magnaldi enters the debate with her own way of severing the Gordian knot. Taking her lead from M. Giusta16), she postulates two originally separate traditions of Peripatetic and Stoic ???e??s?? dating back into the early Hellenistic period. This approach tends to revive certain features of the Dirlmeier line, although the question from which school the doctrine sprang has been removed from it. Rather we should see the two versions as developments from a common backdrop of ideas about nature and morality which had been in the air from Sophistic times onwards. On this hypothesis, M. scrutinizes the accounts in Arius and Cicero, Fin. 5 with a view to uncovering a genuinely Peripatetic doctrine distinct from the Stoic one (e.g. in Fin. 3). However, it remains a moot point what this procedure proves about the ques- tion of origins. Many Peripatetic features may still be seen as adjustments of an originally Stoic scheme17). Moreover, certain technical distinctions she tries to hammer out are not entirely con- vincing: f?se? (Peripatetic) vs. ?p? f?se?? (Stoic); semina virtutis (Peripatetic) vs. ignicula virtutis (Stoic) (pp. 2ff., 22ff.). Apart from these points, there still remain many affinities, most notably the part played in both versions by the 'first things according to nature' (pp. 13ff.). Here M.'s tack is to assume a later contamination due to Carneades, who, using his famous divisio, assimilated the Stoic and Peripatetic positions to bring out all the better the difference between the conceptions of the t???? of the two schools. Indeed, M. posits Cicero's dependence on Carneades in large parts o? Fin., tak-</page><page sequence="9">234 DE NOVIS LIBRIS IUDICIA ing the divisio to be the chief dialectical principle governing Cicero's overall procedure. However, she does little to corroborate these assumptions and so fails to subvert the view?generally accepted by scholars?that Antiochus of Ascalon is Cicero's main source, especially for the account of Peripatetic ethics at Fin. 5.24-7418). In introducing this section, Cicero presents a divisio Carneadea of the various conceptions of the end, qua [seil, divisio] noster Antiochus libenter uti solet (5.16)?a sentence left undiscussed by M., who seems to believe that Carneades must be the source wherever a divisio Carneadea is given. Nor does she deal adequately with other indications in favour of Antiochus (e.g. 8, 14, 75), stressing instead the phrase adhibeamus Theophrastum ad pleraque (12). But this occurs in a passage listing a number of Peripatetics and their works which makes good sense as being derived from Antiochus too19). In view of these and other difficulties, M.'s thesis about Carneades' influence on Cicero and Arius Didymus is not likely to win general acceptance, nor is her assumption about a wholly original Peripatetic doctrine of ???e??s??. As a consequence, the value of this booklet lies rather in its careful discussion of Arius Didymus' account of Aristotelian ethics. Utrecht University, Dept. of Philosophy Teun Tieleman 1) See esp.
