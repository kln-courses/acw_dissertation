<plain_text><page sequence="1">STEAMPUNK AT OXFORD By Herbert Sussman The reimagining of the Victorian world called steampunk has captured the popular imagination. The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen - Mina Murray (nee Harker); Allan Quartermain; Captain Nemo; Henry Jekyll with his alter ego; Hawley Griffith (a.k.a. The Invisible Man) - pursues villains through late- Victorian London in graphic novels and film. In his graphic novels, Sydney Padua takes up an unlikely crime-fighting duo in The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage. In the neo- Victorian novels of Michael Moorcock, such as The War Lord of the Air , armies fight from highly ornamented steam- powered dirigibles. William Gibson's and Bruce Sterling's The Difference Engine brilliantly depicts a nineteenth-century world controlled by enormous steam-powered Babbage computers. An on-line chatroom shares suggestions and photos for creating the Steampunk Home. Steampunk, like much that is neo- Victorian, has also entered the academy with a degree of respectability. The newly-formed website Steam Scholars shares information on the growing number of college courses on the topic and the blossoming of steampunk scholarship. And with the mounting of an exhibition called simply Steampunk by the august Oxford Museum of the History of Science, this twenty-first century version of the Victorian has penetrated the citadel of traditional English culture. What exactly is steampunk? The best answer is that steampunk, a term coined in the late 1980s, describes an extensive contemporary sub-culture whose verbal, visual, cinematic, and material forms are grounded in an alternative history of the Victorians. In this neo- Victorian vision, technological change stopped with the development of steam power, hence the first half of the name. The second industrial revolution of electricity, the internal- combustion engine, and wireless radio has not taken place. But rather than being Luddite in its attitude, steampunk imagines sophisticated innovations employing steam power and the Babbage proto-computer. Without the internal-combustion engine, air travel and aerial warfare takes place in swift steam-powered dirigibles. Steam-powered Analytical Engines control social movement. Steampunk values the Victorian mythos of the individual heroic engineer and inventor. Its heroes are Isambard Kingdom Brunei; Charles Babbage; Ada Lovelace, Babbage's popularizer; Jules Verne; and H. G. Wells. The "punk" in Steampunk derives from an earlier SF genre of the early 1980s, cyberpunk. Both genres transfer the 1970s punk sub-cultural sensibility to a technologically transformed world as a means of commenting on the present day. William Gibson's classic cyberpunk novel Neuromancer (1984) imagines a near future in which people survive bodily death as computer codes and hackers battle vast cyborgian corporate structures. In his substantial steampunk novel The Difference Engine (1990), computer hackers and Luddites battle</page><page sequence="2">Victorians Live 279 in a world that employs steam-powered iron Babbage engines for social control. More specifically, connecting counter-cultural punk to Victorian steam technology draws upon the contemporary sense of Victorian England as the site of intense and often perverse sexuality, of violence, inchoate rebellion, and accelerating technological change - the world of Brunei and Babbage, of Sherlock Holmes and Jack the Ripper. The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage recasts Ada Lovelace, a reclusive mathematician, as a leggy action hero. As graphic novel and film, steampunk has a distinctive visual style. Entranced by the extravagance of Victorian ornamental technological styling, steampunk quite self- consciously rejects the modernity of functionalism and streamlining. If in this alternative history neither the airplane nor the internal-combustion engine has been invented, the Crystal Palace has not been built. For steampunk the visual models are the curlicues, fretwork, and Doric columns that ornament early steam engines, and the Grecian cast-iron capitals that top the supporting columns of the great train sheds. In a skillful curatorial turn, the curators at Oxford brought out from the museum's own extensive collection some steam-age devices of the sort that inspired the steampunk illustrators and artisans in the exhibition. These mechanical artifacts showed the Victorian machine shaped with decoration, anthropomorphism, and visual intelligibility as well as demonstrating the craftsmanship of the skilled artisan working in metal for new instruments and engines. Actual Victorian small-scale models of steam engines bear witness to the importance of craftsmanship in the steam age. A Victorian clockwork metal bird scarer with its open spaces suggests a vocalizing person. A wonderful fragment of intricate gearing from a Babbage Difference Engine machined by a single worker rather than mass-produced shows again the visual openness (no black box here) and the visual attractiveness as complex steam-age machinery approaches the condition of sculpture. The coherer device from the receiver of a Marconi wireless of 1896 looks to the mechanical rather than electronic basis of early radio. The nineteenth-century literary sources of steampunk are the descriptions and the original illustrations of the ornate dirigibles and submarines of Jules Verne and the humanoid Martian fighting machines and spaceships of H. G. Wells's scientific romances. In our visual world such fusion of technologically advanced machinery and retro forms continues in such highly popular films as Dune and the Star Wars series. In the show, Stephane Halleux's "Robotpet," its awkward dog-like shape made of leather and junk metal, resembles the menacing humanoid fighting machines of the Star Wars films. For the schoolboys in blazers and ties on a school trip to the Museum, whose visual consciousness was shaped not by the Bauhaus but by the baroque visuals of Star Wars , the neo- Victorian steampunk artifacts were anything but remote. The boys moved about enthusiastically, continually speaking the current term of highest praise among the pubescent - "Cool." Contemporary steampunk art, objects made or, more accurately, crafted in this steampunk aesthetic by artisans within a global sub-culture, formed the core of what the Oxford Museum of the History of Science described as "the first museum exhibition of Steampunk art." In the exhibition, curated by Art Donovan, a noted American steampunk artist, the objects took a distinctly post-modern stance in self-consciously and ironically transforming the ornamental Victorian machine aesthetic into a contemporary idiom. For a Victorianist, the historically interesting point of this neo- Victorian steampunk art lies in its recuperation of certain neglected aspects of Victorian technology and visuality</page><page sequence="3">280 VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE Figure 18.

Courtesy of the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford. while reshaping these in a "punk" mode as a critique of contemporary technological culture. For one, the exhibition calls to consciousness the decorative extravagance of the Victorian technological imagination, now lost in the triumph of the International Style. After all, the triumph of functionalism and streamlining was contingent, rather than inevitable. The world could have been built in the model of Gaudi's Barcelona or the Secessionist style of Vienna. Steampunk art with its baroque, even mannerist aesthetic of ornamented mechanical objects also recaptures the look of nineteenth-century mechanical devices as a form of visual pleasure that has been lost with functionalism. Such elaborate decor appears in the three-faced watch of Vianney Halter and the bronze curlicues and elongated clock hands in the timepiece of Eric Freitas. Furthermore, the artifacts seek to recapture the transparency in the operation of machinery that so fascinated the Victorians. As one-of-a-kind objects, the artifacts occupy the boundary between technology and art, recalling the centrality of artisanal work to the development of nineteenth-century machinery and evoking the pleasure of craftsmanship in working with machines. Inspectacles by Mad Uncle Cliff (Cliff Overton) (Figure 18) is one of a number of optical instruments in the exhibition, such as the bronze goggles with attached thread and pincushion by Doctor Grymm (Joey Marsocci) and a small telescope with clock by Molly "Porkshanks" Friedrich. This preoccupation of steampunk artists with optical devices references the interest</page><page sequence="4">Victorians Live 28 1 of the Victorians in new instruments to expand vision, such as the actual Victorian compound telescope exhibited from the museum collection, as well as, in a self-referential mode, their own artistic purposes of re-visioning modern technological thinking. These spectacles, or inspectacles, offer a riff on functionalism. Indeed, the basic artistic joke of much steampunk art is that it creates functional objects that are not meant to function according to our ideas of technological efficiency. These artifacts challenge our valuing of technological change as swift, ever accelerating movement. Instead, referring to the slow food movement, Mad Uncle Cliff states his "desire to move from high tech to slow technology. Time can never move fast enough for people today" (Broad Sheet #9). This contraption may work, but in a retro fashion. Here is a return to metal levers, metal gearing, and adjusting screws. In the sub-culture of steampunk, electronics and miniaturization have no part. In these "inspectacles" the slow mechanical work of adjusting the lenses is self- consciously, outwardly, and proudly made visible. The design is open. The lenses are clearly shown. The gearing mechanism and the crank for changing and adjusting lenses are large and visible. The protective covering of the lenses, something like largish inverted tea strainers, is chunky and stands out aggressively. The project of these goggles is to oppose the values of simplification and streamlining by referencing the Victorian pleasure in mechanical operations made visible, as in the power looms and steam hammers that operated to the adulation of crowds at the Crystal Palace or the complex gearing of Babbage's engines that attracted visitors to his house. This slow clunky device with its parts made visible implicitly refutes contemporary ideals of making technological workings invisible, as in the indiscernible transitions in the lenses of contemporary eyeglasses and the invisible currents in the black boxes of computers. As Mad Uncle Cliff says, "I want to move away from the latest amorphous satin steel device with no visible parts back to a product that shouts out its function by showing you how it works" (Broad Sheet #9). Underground Explorer by Tom Ban well (Figure 19) ironically references the Victorian spirit of adventure and discovery. For an imaginary journey into caves, the analogue of the journeys under the sea in Verne or into space in Wells, Banwell has made what he calls a "fantasy" helmet (Broad Sheet #9). This is headwear with a purpose; it incorporates technology for exploration, such as bottled oxygen and an arc-light headlamp. As in Inspectacles , the function is open and exaggerated, as in the metal tubing connecting the helmet to the gas cylinder, the outsized goggles, and the extended nose- and mouthpieces. And as in other steampunk works, as in steam-age machinery itself, the devices are distinctly anthropomorphic, as are the machines of Wells's Martians and of the Star Wars saga. And, again referencing the age of steam, there are embellishments that move beyond function to the ornamental baroque, as in the metal crest of the helmet, more Grecian warrior than explorer, and the studs around the metal vents in the breathing apparatus. Then there is the highly decorated metal border around the edge of the neckpiece as a purely decorative element - studded, pointy, and pierced. The materials also refuse contemporary innovation. The basic material is leather, rather than an industrial metal, and the leather pieces are joined by hand-stitching. The object is set against a purple Victorian ornamental fabric. Here, then, is an ostensibly purposeful object that incorporates a surplus of non-functional decorative elements to become purely fantastical. Perhaps, too, the Underground Explorer also carries the sexual frisson of punk. The leather helmet resonates with the conventional apparatus of bondage and fetishism within the sado-masochistic narratives of the nineteenth century that survive into our time.</page><page sequence="5">282 VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE Figure 19. Tom Banwell, Underground Explorer. Mixed media, [c. 2009]. Courtesy of the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford. If Inspectacles and Underground Explorer move to the fantastical, other steampunk artifacts challenge our distinction between art and technology in a different fashion by hand-crafting models of functional Victorian machines. Jos de Vink offers three hand-made, small-scale replicas in bronze of Stirling hot-air engines, comparable to the model steam engines with brass finials and Doric columns on view from the museum holdings. De Vink's miniature Stirling engines, early nineteenth-century devices that compress hot air rather than steam, lack the decorative fantasia of steampunk work; they are smooth-surfaced and streamlined. These small engines are functional, fully operating, built to work. For de Vink these engines comprise an homage to nineteenth-century inventive skill; they show "the possibility of setting a heavy mass in motion by means of a difference in temperature, using very little energy" (Broad Sheet #9).</page><page sequence="6">Victorians Live 283 Like the hand-made spectacles and the exploring helmet, these hand-crafted atmospheric engines call attention to the centrality of artisanal making for nineteenth-century invention. The value of such handcraft is often lost in the attention paid to the rise of mechanized mass production. James Watt's early engines demanding fine tolerances were first shaped in scale models by skilled artisans within his workshop. The Babbage engines demanded an accurate gearing that had to be machined by hand. But the hand-crafted models made in Watt's workshop or Babbage's were prototypes, intended as mock-ups for eventual mass production for a commercial market, as in Watt's own very successful engine works. For the steampunk artisan, however, the carefully crafted engines, like the ornamented helmet or goggles, mimic prototypes for industrial replication but self-consciously subvert the uses of such craftsmanship for the purposes of industrial capitalism. These artifacts are made by artisans who often choose to have their workshops in remote regions at the margins of the industrial grid; Banwell lives in the town of Rough and Ready in the foothills of the northern California Sierra Nevada. De Vink's engines are not prototypes, but one-off, unique, non-utilitarian creations that employ hand and intuition for the satisfaction of the artisan maker. Compellingly, de Vink argues that his miniature Stirling engines dissolve the boundary of technology and art: "These machines can also be regarded as Steampunk Kinetic Art Objects. I achieved this by unifying the design technically and artistically" (Broad Sheet #9). In looking backwards to handcrafting in the age of steam, steampunk art complicates the powerful narrative constructed by the nineteenth-century arts and crafts movement, and still alive today, which limits the pleasure of working with the hands to the revival of pre-modern handicrafts such as hand-weaving or wood carving. There is, however, a pleasure felt by the machinists of Babbage's gearing and the artisans in Watt's workshop and seen today in folks tinkering under the automobile hood. Such artisanal pleasure in the mechanical device is recalled and displayed in the adjustment mechanism of the Inspectacles and the decorative collar of the Underground Explorer or the hand-modeled miniature engines. The steampunk art shown at Oxford looks to revive the joy of making in a machine age by evoking an alternative Victorian technological universe of steam, proto-computers, and hand-made optical instruments.
