<plain_text><page sequence="1">Chapter 3 Regional Prehistory Dale R. Henning and Thomas D. Thiessen This chapter is an overview of the regional prehistory, with particular attention given to the recognition of the Oneota tradition and arrival of the Omaha/Ponca tribes. THE NORTHWEST IOWA REGION The Blood Run site is located roughly within the boundaries of Prior's (1991) Northwest Iowa Plains. This region is generally comprised of early Wisconsinan glacial drift laid down 20,000-30,000 years ago that is overlain by layers of windblown loess that originated from the Missouri and Big Sioux River valleys. The loess mantle generally ranges from 4.9 meters (16 feet) to the west to 1.2 meters (4 feet) to the east in thickness. On the gla cial outwash terraces upon which the Blood Run site is established, however, the loess mantle is comparatively thin, ranging from several centime ters to perhaps a meter in depth. Generally, the Northwest Iowa Plains is higher in elevation than Prior's other landform regions of Iowa. She (1991:79) regards this region as; "... a definite to pographic step upward to the High Plains of the Dakotas." The region also has the fewest native tracts of timber and currently offers the least aver age annual precipitation in the state at less than 25 inches per year. The oldest exposed bedrock in Iowa is located just north of Blood Run in Gitchie Manitou State Preserve. This reddish Sioux Quartz ite is of pre-Cambrian age, dating over 1.6 billion years old. Much of the stone used by Blood Run inhabitants to produce tools was probably recov ered from the glacial drift that immediately under lies the site. Early occupants of the region were afforded a broad range of materials from which to choose, including igneous, metamorphic and sedi mentary rock. The effects of glacial activity and loess depo sition are readily visible in the gently rolling to pography and moderate slopes dissected by a well developed drainage system. Prominent drainages include the Big Sioux River and its tributary, the Rock River; the upper Floyd River; the upper Little Sioux River and the headwaters of the Maple and Boyer rivers. The Northwest Iowa Plains landform is roughly paralleled by the Missouri-Mississippi drainage divide. While the region is droughty to day and was almost devoid of native wdodlands when first seen by Europeans, it obviously afforded a generous environment at times in the prehistoric past. REGIONAL PREHISTORY Alex (2000) offers a good recent summary of northwest Iowa prehistory from which much in formation about groups occupying the northeast ern Plains prior to the establishment of Oneota vil lages can be drawn. Other sources that offer inter pretations include Anderson and Semken (1980), Benn (1990), Benn and Green (2000), Henning (1998a), Henning and Toom (2003) and Kay (1998). There is some evidence for Paleoindian (pre 10,500 BP) use of the region, much of which is probably covered by the loess that was being de posited at that time. The Clovis projectile point found recently near Sioux City (Molyneaux 1998a, 1998b, 2000) offers solid evidence for their pres ence in this region. The Archaic period (10,500-2,400BP) in the northeastern Plains offers evidence for momentous environmental change and shifting patterns of ex ploitation practiced by the occupants. A significant period of drought (the Hypsithermal) appears to have coincided with a major advance of bison herds. The Cherokee Sewer (Anderson and Semken 1980) and Simonsen (Agogino and Frankforter 1960) sites offer evidence for the harvesting and processing of the large beasts between 9600 and 7500 BP. A few projectile points comparable to 381</page><page sequence="2">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Vol. 49, No. 192, Memoir 36, 2004 those found in sites frequented by the Archaic hunt ers have been found at the Blood Run site, but no other evidence for their frequenting the location has been reported. By Woodland times (2800-1000BP), the herds of bison had long disappeared from the northeast ern Plains, leaving the pottery-making Woodland occupants to subsist on smaller mammals and gath ered foods. Judging from the archaeological evi dence, Woodland populations were small (Benn 1990) and often malnourished (Tiffany et al. 1988) through the Middle Woodland period in this re gion. Adaptation to the bow and arrow coupled with horticultural pursuits appears to have enhanced the subsistence level and quality of life of Late Wood land groups in this region. The Late Woodland pe riod in the northeastern Plains (AD 650-1100) also saw increased interaction with other groups, add ing significantly to the complexity of interpreting the archaeological remains. A few Late Woodland projectile point types found at Blood Run suggest their use of the site or that those points were found and curated by subsequent Oneota groups. Late Woodland sites are reported near Blood Run, but none has been reported within the core area. From ca AD 900 into the early contact period in the northeastern Plains, the archaeological his tory is extremely complex and has been subjected to a range of interpretations. Despite differences, all investigators seem willing to agree that regional population numbers soar, perhaps due in varying measure to climatic events which may have brought greatly increased numbers of bison along the Prai rie-Plains periphery and to technological advances including horticultural practices and the bow and arrow. People of the Initial Middle Missouri and Central Plains traditions established themselves in the Missouri River drainage system, taking advan tage of favorable conditions for gardening, bison hunting, seasonal bird migrations (Lincoln 1939), fishing and collecting. All of these later groups ap pear to have taken full advantage of a favorable environment. While many regional sites dating from ca. AD 900 have been excavated and inter preted, the stated goals of each excavation program varied significantly, resulting in differing interpre tations of times of occupation and the interactive practices of the occupants. The Initial Middle Missouri tradition appears to have evolved directly out of the resident Late Woodland population (Henning 2001). The re gional descendants are identified as Great Oasis (AD 900-1250). Some prefer to place Great Oasis taxonomically as Late Woodland (Tiffany and Alex 2001); others (Henning 2001) suggest that they mark the beginning of the Initial Middle Missouri tradition. Great Oasis occupations have been iden tified in the northern Central Plains near the Mis souri River, in the Middle Missouri and northeast ern Plains regions and as far east as the central and upper Des Moines drainage system. While Great Oasis sites are located very near Blood Run NHL (Benn 1987; Hannus et all986; Lindsay 1970), none has been identified within the Landmark area. Mill Creek/Over (AD 950-1300) people ap parently evolved out of the Great Oasis tradition. As Mill Creek/Over evolved, some Great Oasis people appear to have retained traditional elements of the culture and co-existed with them for per haps three centuries. Mill Creek/Over constitutes an eastern manifestation of the Initial Middle Mis souri tradition (IMMVe; following Toom 1992) and were much more restricted spatially than were Great Oasis groups. Mill Creek/Over people lived in small, often-fortified villages, some of which are recognized by deep stratified middens, located along the lower Big Sioux and upper Little Sioux rivers of Iowa and along the lower James River in South Dakota. Judging from the numbers of mam mal, bird and fish bones and the charred remains of cultigens and wild seeds, nuts and berries found in the middens and pit features, the Mill Creek/ Over food supply was quite ample (Dahlman 1983). Some Mill Creek/Over village sites are littered with evidence for extensive trade (Alex 2000; Henning 2001; Tiffany 1991; Tiffany and Alex 2001). While there is evidence for trade on Late Woodland and Great Oasis sites, these activities were greatly en hanced by their descendants. Mill Creek/Over people apparently developed wealth and prestige well beyond that of most of their western Middle Missouri (IMMVw) relations and their Central Plains tradition contemporaries and neighbors. Perhaps the small, tightly-constricted fortified vil lages were required to protect that wealth and the accompanying religious and social prestige. All evidence suggests that they maintained a unique 382</page><page sequence="3">Dale R. Henning and Thomas D. Thiessen Regional Prehistory and valuable position in an extensive trade network. Comparable, yet expanded, interactive networks were later enjoyed by the occupants of Blood Run and the Arikara (Holder 1970), Mandan and Hidatsa tribes (Wood 1980; Wood and Thiessen 1985) of the Middle Missouri trench. Mill Creek/Over (IMMVe) villages are grouped in the lower James valley, in the upper Little Sioux drainage system and downstream from Blood Run near the confluence of the Big Sioux and Missouri Rivers; above Blood Run there are two little-known villages located near Brandon, South Dakota (Alex 1981). Ceramics characteris tic of Mill Creek/Over in temper and surface treat ment were found in a rodent hole dug into a mound located south of Blood Run Creek by Frederick Manfred (personal communication, ca. 1985). But, there is little additional evidence suggesting IMMVe use of the Blood Run site. Oneota (AD 1300-historic contact) groups probably began their forays into the northeastern Plains prior to AD 1300, the generally-accepted time of settlement in the lower Little Sioux valley. Oneota groups, probably attracted by increasing numbers of bison, began to move into the region from locations in the Mississippi River drainage, probably one cause for the Mill Creek/Over vil lagers' departure. Extensive excavations of Mill Creek/Over sites have produced no evidence for positive interaction between those villagers and Oneota people. On the other hand, there is intrigu ing evidence suggesting Oneota interaction with Central Plains groups in the Kullbom and St. Hel ena phases (Billeck 1993; Blakeslee 1978:142) at ca. AD 1200. There is also evidence for possible Oneota-Central Plains interaction at the Leary site, but the "... data may simply be too imprecise to reveal temporally close but distinct occupations" (Ritterbush 2002b:262). Obviously, despite the confusion wrought by early Leary site excavations, there was positive interaction between people of the Oneota and Central Plains traditions prior to the establishment of permanent Oneota villages. Oneota is best viewed as a cultural tradition, the evolution of which can be traced both tempo rally and spatially. Taxonomically, the Oneota tra dition is subsumed as part of a broadly-conceived Upper Mississippian tradition. The Upper Missis sippian tradition defined by Emerson and Brown (1992:82) encompasses the shared characteristics of two major traditions, the Fort Ancient (Drooker 1997; Griffin 1943), centered in Indiana and Ohio, and the Oneota, found in portions of Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, South Dakota, Kansas, Nebraska and Missouri. Subsumed under the Oneota tradition by Emerson and Brown (1992:80-90) and located in northern Illinois and the Lower Lake Michigan region are the Langford and Fisher traditions. The Fisher tra dition apparently evolved into the Huber phase, possibly the archaeological tradition of the mod ern Ho-Chunk or Winnebago (Hall 2003). Both the Oneota and Fort Ancient traditions span at least several centuries and offer archaeological evidence of their evolution through time. Anumber of 'group continuities'(Hall 1962; Wedel 1963), which trace Oneota evolution within defined localities or re gions, have been suggested and employed (Hall 1962; Henning 1970, 1998a). Some northeastern Plains regional manifesta tions are Oneota-related, but difficult to place within the mainstream of the tradition as we un derstand it today. Alex (1994) discusses a series of sites along the lower James River, eight of which she includes in her Olivet phase. These collections have been studied and might best be characterized as a thin scattering of mixed cultural materials that include a few Oneota ceramics with mixed tem pers. The Initial Coalescent tradition (Lehmer 1971) Arzberger site (Spaulding 1956) dated at ca. AD 1450 produced Oneota pottery, some of which resembles pieces from Blood Run. The Shea site near the Red River in North Dakota (Michlovic and Schneider 1988,1993) offer ties to Oneota that date after AD 1400 (Toom 2004:285). Sites with possible ties to the northeastern Plains Oneota manifestations are found in Ontario and Manitoba as well (Syms 1979). Some materi als, especially red pipestone tablets, suggest contemporaneity and interaction with Blood Run occupants. That suggested interaction, through which the pipestone objects could have been ob tained, need not necessarily have been direct. Taxonomic considerations have been pondered at length (Henning 1998c; Hollinger and Benn 1998; Overstreet 1998) and, while the manner in which we employ the Willey and Phillips (1958) system is not agreed upon by all active researchers 383</page><page sequence="4">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Vol. 49, No. 192, Memoir 36, 2004 (Fishel 1999:119; Tiffany 1998:149-151), their spatial, cultural and temporal concepts and terms will be employed as interpreted by the author (Henning 1998c). When and under what conditions the Oneota tradition can first be recognized as a viable cul tural entity is still a hotly-debated matter. Oneota radiocarbon assays have been compiled (Boszhardt, et al.1995; see also Overstreet 2001) and will be referred to throughout this discourse. Oneota was once believed to have developed out of and after the Middle Mississippian period of efflorescence (Cleland 1966:88; Griffin 1943:302, 1960:835, 1964:251,1967), an idea that has had some staunch advocates (Boszhardt 1998; Rodell 1991; Stoltman 1986; Tiffany 1998). A number of early radiocar bon assays, when combined with the available ar chaeological evidence, suggest that the Oneota tra dition did not necessarily evolve from a Missis sippian ancestor or by direct stimulus from a Middle Mississippian source, i.e., Cahokia. Cur rent thinking about Cahokia suggests that its fluo rescence and period of greatest influence began abruptly with a 'big bang' at ca. AD 1050, prob ably stimulated by an influx of immigrants (Pauketat 2002), and was drawing to an end by AD 1350 (Pauketat and Emerson 1997). Oneota people appear not to have participated directly in activities on the American Bottom, more likely evolving as a separate but contemporary cultural tradition. Questions about the quality and results of Oneota-Mississippian interactions in southern Wisconsin (see Overstreet 2000), around the mouth of the Apple River (Bennett 1945:127-158; Emerson 1991a, 1991b), on the La Crosse terrace (Elder 2003:7), and at Diamond Bluff (Rodell 1991) to the north will probably persist far into the future. Increasing evidence suggests that elements of the Oneota tradition may be traced back to at least AD 900, culminating 700 years later in our identi fication of several American Indian tribes. Benn (1989,1995) states clearly his belief that the Oneota tradition had its antecedents in regional Woodland groups. Some researchers have traced mythologi cal, religious, and social traditions into Woodland antecedents that date back at least a millennium and are still extant in historic tribes that emerge as traditional Oneota (Salzer 1992, 1993; Salzer and Rajnovich 2000). Given this orientation, the be ginnings of a recognizable Oneota tradition appear in eastern Wisconsin (Overstreet 2000,2001) dur ing the Emergent Mississippian (Kelly 1990) at least a century before the 'big bang' on the Ameri can Bottom. Oneota horizons are identified by generally agreed-upon overall changes in cultural patterns that are more-or-less useful as temporal markers. These horizons are identified by broadly-defined horizon styles that apparently transcend consider able expanses of space, but are limited in the time they retained their popularity. Pottery is now most often used to identify Oneota horizon styles, but disk-bowl pipes, pipestone (and, other materials) tablets, and some stone tool types offer good po tential as horizon markers as well. In western Iowa, we now compare with the horizon styles employ ing pottery decorative elements and motifs devel oped for the La Crosse terrace (Boszhardt 1994), a well-conceived series of readily-identifiable changes. But we should feel the need to constantly review and re-evaluate any relevant data and the manner in which it is interpreted when making comparisons. After all, the La Crosse terrace and the Northwest Iowa region are quite separate both in terms of distance and the cultural influences entertained by their occupants over time. Overstreet (1998:29-30) makes the need for constant re-evalu ation eminently clear, but such an effort is beyond the scope of this presentation. Nonetheless, hori zons and horizon-styles are tentatively employed; changes in their application and regional validity will undoubtedly be made following future research and analysis. An Emergent horizon Oneota has been defined in eastern Wisconsin (Overstreet 1998) and is not duplicated outside that region. Overstreet (1998:31) suggests that Emergent Oneota might someday be defined in the Red Wing region, but the necessary data have not been forthcoming. At this time, the best evidence for early Oneota evolution is identi fied in eastern Wisconsin. Even should contempo raneous Oneota sites elsewhere be identified in the future, it is very likely that there will be signifi cant and definable differences when those com plexes are carefully compared with the eastern Wisconsin manifestations. In fact, the eastern Wis consin Oneota manifestations, especially the ce 384</page><page sequence="5">Dale R. Henning and Thomas D. Thiessen Regional Prehistory ramies, are quite distinctive from those to the west, even those located on the La Crosse terrace, irre spective of time. The Oneota tradition is linked to several tribal entities that are identified historically, giving the Oneota researcher links to reality that prehistoric archaeologists simply do not have. Rather solid ties linking the tradition to specific tribes have been made for (listed in order of descending confidence) the Ioway, Missouri, Omaha/Ponca, Kansa, Ho Chunk (Winnebago), probably the Oto, and Os age. The Oto, traditionally and linguistically linked closely with the Ioway (Wedel 1981, 1986; Whitman 1937), are particularly problematic be cause when they are documented historically, their material culture reflects Late Coalescent rather than an Oneota tradition. They were apparently regarded as an independent tribe by at least AD 1680 when they visited Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle at Fort Crevecoeur on the Illinois River (Wedel 1986:19). The Oto were not accompanied by Ioways who apparently never visited either of La Salle's forts nor are they directly linked histori cally to the Ioways from that time forward, lead ing to the conclusion that the fission had taken place before 1680. Linguistic data is useful, but can be disappointing to the Oneota specialist. Our lives as archaeologists would be considerably enhanced if the archaeological traditions we have defined were consistent with the language dialects defined for specific groups, but sometimes they simply are not. For instance, and pertinent to any discussion of Blood Run, the archaeology of the Dhegihan speakers (Henning 1993; Hoffman 1990; Johnson 1991) is not at all consistent, however it is inter preted. If we are correct that the Omaha/Ponca were the principal occupants of Blood Run, it is notable that their identified archaeological remains (if at all separable from the remains attributable to the Ioway) are very distinct from any of their dialectic cousins, the Kansa, Osage, the Ponca (who emerge on the historic scene with a non-Oneota ceramic tradition after a century of separation), or the Quapaw who are most notably divergent from the others. The differences suggest that material cul ture can change very rapidly and for many reasons, erasing most of the continuity that we archaeolo gists depend upon so heavily for our derivation of relationships. Some of the differences between these linguistically related groups will be discussed on succeeding pages. Migration legends (Dhegihan legends are discussed below) are also useful tools, but often leave the researcher with unresolved ques tions. THE ONEOTA TRADITION DEFINING CHARACTERISTICS Oneota culture is generally defined within a Prairie Peninsula habitat (Borchert 1950; Transeau 1935), but the artifact assemblage includes many items such as scapula digging tools, cancellous abrading tools (hide grainers), squash knives, end scrapers, beveled knives, Harahey knives, grooved mauls and steamed and bent antler strip ornaments, all characteristic of Plains villagers. There is a great deal of variation among Oneota sites, depending upon time of occupation, region occupied, re sources being exploited, and other factors, some of which have been summarized elsewhere (Henning 1998a). In contrast to many other late prehistoric groups, Oneota villages are not fortified. They are also comparatively large, suggesting that many Oneota groups depended on population size rather than fortification for village protection. Some of the later Oneota groups, most notably at Blood Run, Utz, and the villages located along the Upper Iowa and Root Rivers, built redoubts of heaped-up earth either as part of the village or nearby, which pro vided a location where villagers probably as sembled for protection. Treatment of the dead varied widely. A few Oneota groups (e.g., Blood Run, the Okoboji phase in northwest Iowa, the Red Wing region, and the Grand River phase in Wisconsin) typically built mounds in which they buried their dead. Mound burial at Blood Run and on Okoboji phase sites may have been part of a protohistoric revitaliza tion movement (Berts 2003) harking back to an cestral Late Woodland practices. The typically su pine, but occasionally flexed, and partial remains were also interred in cemeteries (M. Wedel 1959) and in house floors (O'Gorman 1995; Vradenburg 1999), sometimes with grave offerings such as small pottery jars, chipped stone, bone and antler tools, ornaments, and occasionally with trophy skulls (Bray 1961). There is some evidence for defleshing and re-articulation as part of the burial 385</page><page sequence="6">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Vol. 49, No. 192, Memoir 36, 2004 routine (Henning and Peterson 1965; Orr 1963). Human skeletal remains are occasionally found in storage/trash pits, often as a few articulated ele ments or individual fragments, suggesting a very casual attitude toward the dead. Burned, cut, in cised, polished and painted human elements have been recovered from many villages suggesting that human bone may be found anywhere on an Oneota site. House types vary markedly (Hollinger 1995), ranging from quite small on the earlier sites to very large and long (some over 30 meters in length) by ca. AD 1500, to variable in size and form in the contact period. Some houses were semi-subterra nean; others were clearly established on the sur face. Houses characterized by boulder outlines are recorded only at the Blood Run site. Hollinger (1995), while tracing possible shifts in rules for residence and lineality among Oneota people, sug gests that these related patterns are dependent on many factors and have changed through time. He concludes that "... residence shifted from patrilo cal during the Emergent and Developmental hori zons to matrilocal during the Classic horizon and returned to patrilocal during the early Historic ho rizon" (Hollinger 1995:165). Most Oneota village sites are characterized by subterranean storage/trash pits that we often find filled with food refuse and stored or discarded ar tifacts. These features offer evidence for cultiva tion of corn, beans, squash, sunflower and other cultivars, coupled with very efficient hunting, fish ing and collecting. Some groups may have de pended heavily upon seasonal expeditions in search of bison, especially as those animals became more plentiful in the western Prairie Peninsula. There is no single artifact that is consistently found on all sites assigned to the Oneota tradition with, perhaps, the exception of the simple triangu lar arrowhead. At one time, Oneota was defined as a "pottery culture" (Hall 1962:108; M. Wedel 1959:111), suggesting that assignment to that tra dition could be done on the basis of characteristic shell tempered pottery alone, following its origi nal definition (Keyes 1927; Orr 1914). Indeed, Oneota pottery is characteristic, but varies far more in its paste than we realized a few decades ago. Today, we include sites with ceramic assemblages that have little to no shell temper in the pottery. For instance, the Mero complex on Wisconsin's Door Peninsula, with 38 percent grit tempered sherds (Mason 1981:357), the White Rock phase, with 49-100 percent sand tempered, depending on the site and the analyst (Logan 1998:261), as well as Blood Run with its variable (see Chapter 5) tem pering preferences, are all examples of Oneota complexes that present a sufficient number of gen eralized traits that they can be included irrespec tive of the temper employed in pottery vessel manu facture. For instance, an off-hand definition of an Oneota artifact assemblage might include (usually) shell-tempered, globular jars with opposed handles, simple triangular arrowpoints, end scrapers and bison scapula digging tools. But, not all Oneota pottery is shell-tempered, not all arrowpoints from Oneota sites are simple triangular in shape, some Oneota sites offer few to no end scrapers, and the bison (some are elk) scapula digging tools vary greatly in numbers from site to site. Today, Oneota site analyses should not be restricted to or focused on ceramics analysis. Other traits could be equally important to our understanding of the site occu pants themselves and their patterns of relationships outside the site boundaries. Oneota pottery is tempting to concentrate upon, if only because it is ubiquitous to most sites. Vessels are generally restricted to circular, round bottomed, smooth-surfaced jars with outflaring rim and two or four opposed strap or loop handles. Bowls are rare, but occur in small numbers on most sites. Shell temper was once a defining Oneota characteristic. But, when carefully analyzed, we find that Oneota pottery may contain shell, grog, grit, limestone, hematite and other materials, even fragments of bone, as part of the paste. Some jars have the characteristic Oneota shape, surface treat ment and decorative motifs, but are not shell tem pered. Pottery is helpful, however, providing us with short-lived "horizon styles" that may be seen to link widely-scattered components both tempo rally and culturally. Vessel shape and size vary both temporally and spatially as do the decorative ele ments and motifs applied to lip, rim and shoulder. Chipped stone items found on most Oneota sites are small, simple triangular arrowpoints (oc casionally small expanding-stemmed, and triangu lar notched forms are also found), end scrapers, side scrapers, bifacial knives, drills, simple perfo 386</page><page sequence="7">Dale R. Henning and Thomas D. Thiessen Regional Prehistory rators, gravers, occasional "Harahey" (diamond shaped, double-beveled) knives and a host of flake tool types. The end scrapers are characteristically made of thick flakes struck from a prepared core, then shaped and finished with unifacial percussion and pressure flaking. They are found in greater numbers than arrowpoints on many Oneota sites. Ground stone objects include grinding slabs, manos, shaft abraders, grooved mauls, celts, sharp ening and abrading stones and, occasionally, discoidals. Other than the discoidals, the Oneota ground stone assemblage includes very few pieces that offer evidence for use in a single pursuit. For instance, the grinding slabs and manos are often scarred and battered, suggesting their use as anvils and in chipped stone tool processing. Many shaft abraders obviously served additional abrading pur poses and the celts are almost universally battered both on the edge and poll, suggesting regular use as hammers. The grooved mauls appear to have served primarily as hafted maul/hammer heads, judging from the polish and use-marks on their surfaces. Discoidals, while rare, have been found on Dixon (Harvey 1979:86), Bastian (Tiffany 1979:52), Milford (Tiffany and Anderson 1993) and Blood Run (Starr 1893) and should be included in the Oneota inventory. Pipes (Bray 1991; Hamilton 1967) are quite common on some Oneota sites and range from very simple small elbow pipes of limestone, soapstone, red pipestone (probably catlinite) or other soft stone to large disk-bowl types with extended prow. The northwest Iowa Oneota sites offer a broad range of pipes made of many kinds of material. THE ONEOTA OF THE NORTHWEST IOWA REGION Blood Run is located in the northwest Iowa region (Henning 1998b), where a number of Oneota sites have been studied intensively. While it might seem most fitting to employ Prior's (1991) North west Iowa Plain as the cultural region, the sites included in the Okoboji phase fall just to the east. Thus the regional definition will stand. Factors that may have encouraged Oneota settlement into this region and the possible relationships between the regional sites are discussed below. Oneota village sites were probably established in the western periphery of the Prairie Peninsula prior to AD 1350. The Oneota 'influence' on resi dent populations along the Red River to the north of the focal area (Michlovic and Schneider 1988, 1993) ca. AD 1100 offers intriguing suggestions of early Oneota activities to the west. While it is very likely that Oneota groups came here much earlier to take advantage of the increasingly large bison herds (Ritterbush 2002a), no known perma nent Oneota occupation sites were established in northwest Iowa prior to 1350, although earlier settlements farther onto the Plains have been sug gested (Ritterbush and Logan 2000). Thus far, no known site complex offers cultural remains that suggest ancestry to those early components located in the lower Little Sioux River valley. We simply do not know exactly where these first Oneota set tlers in the eastern Plains moved from. We do know that several sites centered in the Correctionville locality may have been occupied simultaneously from no later than AD 1350 into the 1500's (see Boszhardt et al. 1995). The Bastian vil lage is located upstream from the Correctionville locality and dates from ca.1450, suggesting that the Correctionville sites may have been partially contemporaneous. It is possible that the Bastian and Blood Run occupations were partially contem poraneous as well. The number of people in the northwest Iowa region appears to have increased markedly from the sixteenth century, probably in great measure the result of movements out of the east. The Blood Run occupations appear to have been initiated at this time. THE CORRECTIONVILLE PHASE Dixon, Gothier, Anthon and Correctionville, the Correctionville phase (Fishel 1999; Harvey 1979; Henning 1961, 1970, 1998a) sites in the lower Little Sioux valley locality (Figure 3.1), of fer comparable material culture remains and are geographically close. With further intensive sur vey, other local components will probably be added. Villages of the Correctionville phase (the Correctionville terrace, now a rather inactive gravel pit, may have been the location of two separate villages) are usually on first and second terraces. The Dixon site, located on a very low terrace, is often flooded. At Dixon, the most intensively stud ied site in the locality, three partial houses have 387</page><page sequence="8">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Vol. 49, No. 192, Memoir 36, 2004 I ? ? ?

Human bone is found in pit features; one stor age pit excavated at Dixon produced a human fe mur and a fully-articulated torso (Harvey 1979:75). No cemeteries or mound burials have been found in this locality. Some human bone found in Correctionville phase village sites is cut, scratched and polished (Lillie 1999). One large skull frag ment found at the Dixon site has part of the "bird man" motif and a four-pointed star incised on one surface (Fishel 1999:6). Artifacts from the Correctionville phase sites are generally comparable to those recovered from Oneota sites across the Prairie Peninsula, with the exception of large numbers of grooved mauls and the fact that much of the chipped stone assemblage is derived from sources in Kansas and Nebraska (Fishel 1999:132). Catlinite is found, but in small pieces and in comparison with the Bastian, Blood Run and the Okoboji phase sites, is quite rare. Data from the Dixon site suggests permanency, perhaps even year-round occupation (Fishel 1995:91). Dixon faunal analyses imply intensive bison hunting away from the village, also the taking of deer, dog, elk and smaller mammals, and use of riverine resources including fish and shellfish (Jans-Langel 1999). Floral analyses have produced an exhaustive array of utilized plants (Schroeder 1999). Cultigens include maize, cucurbits, some beans, some sunflower, chenopodium, amaranth and marsh elder. Locally-available seeds such as little barley, wild rye, barnyard grass, American 388</page><page sequence="9">Dale R. Henning and Thomas D. Thiessen Regional Prehistory lotus, burweed marsh elder and fruits and nuts such as black nightshade, ground cherry, sumac, rose, blackberry or raspberry, grape, walnut and hazel nut were intensively collected. THE BASTIAN LOCALITY The Bastian locality (Bray 1963; Harvey 1979; Henning 1970; Tiffany 1979) is defined on the basis of one site, the Bastian village, located just north of Cherokee at the confluence of Mill Creek with the Little Sioux River (Figure 3.1). Although sur veyed (Tiffany 1979) and tested in the course of salvaging materials from an expanded road (Harvey 1979:186), the site is poorly known. Tiffany sug gests that there may be several closely-spaced, separate villages on the site. The Bastian site dates, on the basis of one radiocarbon assay, between AD 1425 and 1550 (Boszhardt et al. 1995). There are no associated mounds and no evidence of house outlines has been encountered. No cemetery area has been located. The Bastian site is very impor tant, if only because it is the site from which the Stiles tablets (Bray 1963) and dozens of additional tablets and fragments thereof have been recovered. The Stiles tablets were sold to Nestor Stiles of Cherokee, by a person who stated that all ten were found together on the Bastian site. Because they were unique and are spectacular both in their over all size and the motifs incised on their surfaces (Bray 1963; Betancourt 1965), some doubts were expressed about their authenticity. But, also curated at the Sanford Museum is the Christianson collec tion from the Bastian site surface. This collection includes at least 75 additional tablets and tablet fragments, which suggests verification of the Stiles tablets' authenticity. Many cut and partially-pro cessed catlinite pieces have been found on the site by others, suggesting that the site occupants spe cialized in working this soft red stone. Stiles do nated his tablets to the Sanford Museum in Chero kee. The 10 Stiles tablets are complete and partial slabs of catlinite ranging to 23.5 cm long and 19 cm wide; thickness ranges between one and two cm. Bray (1963:17-32) illustrates many of the mo tifs found on these plaques, motifs including "bird man", anthropomorphic figures, serpents, birds, water monsters, bison and other animals, heartlines, weeping eye, lightning, talleys, feathers, and ar rows, to name a few. Some flat surfaces are com pletely devoid of motifs; their surfaces suggest "erasing" of prior motifs in preparation for others. Tablet function can only be surmised; the motifs suggest traditional cult-ceremonial activities, some perhaps related to hunting magic, that were shared by many North American groups. Comparable tab lets are found on Blood Run and on many Oneota sites (Betancourt 1965; Hollinger 2000), but num bers, size and quality seem focused in this region. The few pottery fragments from Bastian (Harvey 1979; Tiffany 1979) suggest a closer rela tionship to the large Leary site in southeastern Nebraska (Hill and Wedel 1936; Ritterbush 2000b) than to any known western Oneota site. Prelimi nary sorting of excavated pottery from Leary (Lauren Ritterbush, personal communication 2002) suggests that most of it offers decorative trends comparable to the Classic horizon that is defined from the La Crosse terrace in the upper Missis sippi valley (Boszhardt 1998). There are also a few Leary sherds that are comparable to Allamakee Trailed, usually associated with the early contact period Orr phase. Only two radiocarbon assays have been made on charcoal from Leary (Boszhardt et al. 1995:220), suggesting dates from early in the thirteenth into the mid-fourteenth century and ear lier than Bastian. Bastian is separable spatially, perhaps cultur ally and, in part at least, temporally from the Correctionville phase sites and appears to have been occupied relatively briefly. Bastian may also have been partly contemporaneous with Blood Run. A Bastian phase should be defined in the fu ture. THE OKOBOJI PHASE The Okoboji phase (Henning 1998a) includes Oneota sites in the Lake Okoboji-Upper Little Sioux locality of northwest Iowa (Figure 3.1). The sites included (Harvey 1979; Henning 1970,1998a, 1998b; Tiffany and Anderson 1993), Gillett Grove, Milford and Harriman, offer remains that closely resemble the late Orr phase materials of the La Crosse region, suggesting that they represent move ment of the Ioway off the Upper Iowa and Root River valleys to the west (Mott 1938; Wedel 1981, 389</page><page sequence="10">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Vol. 49, No. 192, Memoir 36, 2004 1986). They all have some European trade items in their artifact inventories. Gillett Grove once boasted twelve low mounds and a circular enclosed area about 100 yards in di ameter, with walls sixteen feet wide and two feet high (Henning 1961:32-3; Keyes 1921). The site is small, estimated by Hull and Bargloff (1966:9 10) at approximately 2 acres. Quantities of Euro pean trade copper and/or brass tubular beads, bangles and tinklers, small iron objects and glass beads have been recovered from the surface. Harvey (1979:189) reports three metal rings, one with IHS on it, copper and/or brass kettle frag ments, iron projectile points and knives, and some turquoise, all recovered from the surface by Bargloff. The letters IHS are characteristic of Je suit rings, which are often found on early contact sites (Cleland 1972; Mason 2003; Wood and Wood 1974). Jesuit rings offer evidence for trade with Europeans, but do not necessarily reflect interac tions with members of the Jesuit order (Mason 2003). No gun parts are known to have been re covered from the site proper, but have been found in a nearby field, suggesting an unexplored later but related component. Catlinite pipe fragments, pipe blanks, beads, pendants and random sawed and cut pieces are found in large numbers on the site. Harvey (1979:150) was cautious in her iden tification of the pottery as "Oneota in appearance," while Henning (1970:159) suggested that it "can be classified as Allamakee Trailed." That statement was based on Mildred Wedel's (1959; see also Henning 1961) definition of the type and should be re-evaluated, perhaps following the analytic pro cedures employed for Blood Run pottery (see Chapter 5). Field schools have been conducted on the Gillett Grove site (Short et al. 2002), but no reports of excavations have been published. Judg ing from the range and quantity of historic arti facts recovered from the surface, the area from which those materials were recovered was prob ably occupied near the end of the seventeenth and very early in the eighteenth century. The Milford Oneota site is located on a high terrace in a horseshoe bend of the upper Little Sioux River, about 4.5 miles southwest of West Okoboji Lake (Tiffany and Anderson 1993). Concentrations of village materials are reported in at least five sepa rate locales within the horseshoe bend. Excavations conducted in 1978 produced large amounts of food refuse and artifacts. Two large, irregularly-shaped midden-filled basins (houses?) were encountered (neither was completely excavated); one storage pit feature and several concentrations of ash, bone and cobbles were identified in the three areas tested. The artifacts recovered suggest intensive occupa tion. Keyes' notes (1921) suggest that several mounds, not visible today, were associated with the site. Bone preservation was exceptionally good, offering evidence for broadly-based hunting and fishing. Bison elements predominated, followed in numbers by dog (comparable to Blood Run), then by pocket gophers, some of which probably intro duced themselves. Fish were taken from calm wa ter ponds and shallow lake water. Birds, if found, are not reported. Some corn and a single squash seed were the only cultigens noted in the prelimi nary analysis. The pottery is generally comparable to that of the Orr phase, suggesting occupation by people from the Upper Iowa and Root River valleys, pos sibly the Ioway and Oto (see Chapter 5 for discus sion). Lithic implements are those expected on a traditional western Oneota site. Cut and abraded catlinite fragments abound. Tiffany and Anderson (1993:301) offer a table listing 2000 items in the Darrell Frerichs surface collection. Included in that number are 520 catlinite pieces; 73 pipes and pipe fragments, two pendants, one effigy and 444 worked pieces. Copper (some probably brass) items identified by Tiffany and Anderson (1993) include beads, a discoidal, a buckle, projectile points, and a quill flattener. There are red, white and blue glass beads. Silver Jesuit rings, a silver bead and a silver Apostle spoon fragment, and metal (iron?) projec tile points, fish hooks, trade axes, gun barrels, pow der cans, knives, a cross, pins and many gun parts and accouterments are listed (identifications by Tiffany and Anderson). Gunflints, lead shot and a lead pendant have also been recovered from Milford. Another benefit of European contact was the presence of Rattus sp., the Old World rat (Tif fany and Anderson 1993:303), the first recorded in this region. It is important to note that only one end scraper was recorded, but over 1100 triangu 390</page><page sequence="11">Dale R. Henning and Thomas D. Thiessen Regional Prehistory lar chipped stone projectile points are inventoried. Very likely, these villagers had replaced their chipped stone endscrapers with metal tools by this time. Some gardening was apparently done here, but the scapula digging tools that are almost ubiq uitous to regional Oneota sites are not mentioned. Again, had they been replaced by metal tools? It seems reasonable that the Milford site was occupied during Le Sueur's activities in southern Minnesota. Mildred Wedel (1981:3-7) suggests that the Ioway had good relations with French traders, the Sioux and the "Algonquians" prior to Le Sueur's travels to the Minnesota River valley. These prior relationships probably resulted in their obtaining small trade items such as beads, knives and kettles. Late in the year 1700, Le Sueur com pleted a post, Fort Vert or Fort L'Huillier, on the Blue Earth River. From there, he sent messengers to find the Ioway and Oto and encourage them to settle near his fort, plant gardens and work in his mines. The first group of messengers was unable to find them and returned. Shortly, another group set out on the same errand and found the old vil lage site, but no one was in residence. Apparently, the Ioways had joined the "Mahas" (Omaha, at Blood Run) or were living in that neighborhood. Mildred Wedel suggests that some Ioway (and Oto?) did ultimately establish themselves near Fort Vert, probably in 1701, shortly after Le Sueur was called back to France. They apparently remained there for a very brief period of time, if only be cause Le Sueur's men abandoned the fort later that year in the face of attacks by the Fox and Mascouten Indians. Wedel (1981:5) asks rhetori cally: "Did the Ioway return to their lake village where they were more safe now that the French fort no longer existed?", but could offer no answer. They probably did and, judging from the remains recovered there, they returned to the Milford site. Tiffany and Anderson limit the Milford occu pations to AD 1688-1700, citing Wedel (1976, 1981,1986). The accounts she cites and interprets, combined with the list of historic trade items found at the site, suggest alternatively that the site was occupied intermittently and probably intensively one or more times shortly after AD 1700. The his toric accounts and maps available to us do not ab solutely verify Ioway occupations on the site, but one or both of those tribes' presence there is prob ably our best option. The historic materials recov ered from Milford suggest that it was occupied shortly after the Blood Run villagers had vacated because no guns, gun flints, trade axes, or powder cans are found at Blood Run. These items are quite common on Milford, yet are found in association with traditional items such as pottery and chipped stone arrowheads. Thus, the Milford village site may have been occupied intermittently from ca. AD 1700 to perhaps as late as 1725, judging from site inventories and the historic record. The Harriman village is located on a high ter race to the south of the Little Sioux River. Twelve low mounds are mentioned in Keyes' notes, curated by the Office of the State Archaeologist, Iowa City, Iowa. No formal excavations have been performed. The site has been inflexibly protected by the land owner for years and is rarely visited by other than the most foolhardy collectors. The few ceramics from Harriman that were studied years ago were similar in paste, color and form to Orr phase mate rials (Henning 1961:32). Mr. Rex Hansman (per sonal communication 1958), then of Storm Lake, Iowa, had recovered copper or brass artifacts, glass beads and an iron axe from the site. Judging from the presence of these European trade items, the Harriman village should date a little later than Blood Run. Mildred Wedel (1981:5) discusses the possi bilities for finding an Ioway village on Spirit Lake, perhaps on the east side, but no site comparable to those discussed above has been recorded there. The presence of mounds on or near these vil lage sites suggests a cultural relationship to Blood Run, where mounds abound in the habitation ar eas. Apparently, the intermittent occupation of vil lage sites suggested both in the historic record and through archaeological investigations is the norm here. The data suggest that Milford was the last village occupied judging from the presence of gun parts, tools for loading and maintenance of guns, and heavy iron items such as axes. The axe from Harriman suggests nearly comparable age, but that site lacks guns and gun equipment. Sites assigned to the Okoboji phase apparently constitute the remains of Ioway occupations from, perhaps, the mid-1600s into the early 1700s. The 391</page><page sequence="12">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Vol. 49, No. 192, Memoir 36, 2004 remains found are consistent with ethnographic and historic accounts and are directly comparable to materials recovered from the Upper Iowa and Root River valley Orr phase Oneota sites. The Ioway were constantly on the move in the last half of the seventeenth century. The French first became aware of the Ioway (possibly with the Oto) through the accounts of the Ottawa and Hu ron who had traveled to their homeland in search of a new home far from the Iroquois in AD 1656 or 1657 (Wedel 1986:7). The Ioway were next en countered by Fr. Louis Andre' (no mention of the Oto) while seven or eight families were living with the Winnebago south of Green Bay. These rela tionships and others surely gave the Ioway early access to European trade materials and their peace with the Sioux and Ojibwa gave them freedom to travel across Wisconsin and northern Iowa unhin dered. Their positive relations with the Sioux are further corroborated in the Bradbury phase (Birk and Johnson 1992), a complex of sites attributed to the Mdewakanton Dakota that offer Oneota-like and typical Orr phase pottery fragments that char acterize the Ioway at this time. THE BLOOD RUN SITE The Blood Run site will be discussed at great length in succeeding pages. Suffice it to say at this point that Blood Run is unique. It is not only of immense size, with unique features such as hun dreds of mounds, a possible serpent effigy, boul der circles and ovals, a large earthen enclosure and pitted boulders, but is the only site in northwest Iowa that appears to be a historically-documented Omaha village. Historic and ethnohistoric docu mentation (see Chapter 2 and the Buffalohead ar ticle, this volume) and the archaeology of the site all suggest that other tribes, most notably the Ioway, Oto, Arikara, and Cheyenne or representatives thereof, visited there regularly and apparently stayed for extended periods of time, perhaps for protection, and perhaps to attend annual or semi annual rendezvous. The Ponca probably lived here before they separated from the Omaha; thus, it seems appropriate to refer to the principal occu pants of Blood Run as Omaha/Ponca. Blood Run may have been occupied for over two centuries, from about AD 1500 to shortly be fore 1714. That the site was important in the trade networks of the time is obvious from the range of artifacts identified. It was a perfect location for trade and other forms of interaction, with easy ac cess for groups from the Plains and the upper Prai rie Peninsula. Its position near the catlinite quar ries and the presence of quantities of that commod ity on the surface and in the pit features suggests that the occupants were actively quarrying that soft stone for trade and the manufacture of pipes, tab lets and other objects. The Omaha/Ponca, like most other tribes of this time, were also caught up in an effort to obtain European trade items easily and without conflict. Their presence in a location per fectly placed to take advantage of trading oppor tunities, both with other tribes and Europeans, prob ably gained the envy and enmity of other tribes, especially the Sioux who were located to the north. Pressure from the Sioux may have been an impor tant factor in their vacating Blood Run, a process that probably began shortly after AD 1700. By AD 1714 the Omaha had split with the Ponca and were established near the Missouri River at its confluence with the White River (Norall 1988:108 109). The Omaha spoke a Dhegihan Siouan dialect as did the Ponca, Osage, Kansa, and Quapaw. Their linguistic affiliations suggest that at one time these groups were one or at least occupied the same re gion. One would expect that some recognizable survivals of a shared material culture would have been retained by all the Dhegihan-speakers, but this is not corroborated archaeologically. DHEGIHAN ARCHAEOLOGY While we are specifically concerned with the principal occupants of the Blood Run NHL, pre sumably the Omaha tribe, it seems only prudent to surnmarize briefly the locations of their closest lin guistic relatives and something of their material cultures at the time of contact, i.e., when their sites were first identified and recorded historically (Fig ure 3.2). These data have been summarized (Henning 1993) and will not be dealt with in detail here. Dhegiha Sioux migration legends (Dorsey 1886; Fletcher and La Flesche 1911:72-3; Nuttall 1980:93) are generally similar. Briefly, the tribes apparently once lived as one somewhere east of 392</page><page sequence="13">Dale R. Henning and Thomas D.

Wedel 1959; Young and Hoffman 2001. the Mississippi River, probably in the Ohio valley. At the mouth of the Ohio, the Quapaw departed and moved downstream in the Mississippi valley while the others proceeded upstream to the mouth of the Missouri, where they remained for some time. They then went upstream along the Missouri, the Osage departing at the mouth of the Osage River, which they ascended, the Kansa stopping at the Kansas River, and the Omaha and Ponca con tinuing on upstream. Given the origin myths, certain material cul ture objects and historical reasons, some archaeolo gists (Henning 1993; Vehik 1993) have expressed willingness, perhaps even eagerness, to believe that the Dhegihan-speakers once occupied sites in the lower Ohio and central Mississippi River valleys. Pauketat and Emerson (1997:25-26) suggest that the Osage and Omaha shared elements of an elabo rate political and ritual leadership hierarchy and many legends that may have been derived in part from interaction with Cahokians or other Missis sippians at the time of Cahokia efflorescence (AD1050-1200/1275). Some of the legends may have been shared well prior to this period of time, suggesting that they were parts of an older, broadly shared cosmology (Salzer 1993; Salzer and 393</page><page sequence="14">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Vol. 49, No. 192, Memoir 36, 2004 Rajnovich 2001) rather than developed specifically during the Lohmann and Stirling phases in the American Bottom. Is it possible that the Dhegihan speakers were in some measure responsible for the 'big bang' that started the period of efflorescence there? The Caborn-Welborn sites located at the confluence of the Ohio and Wabash rivers may also be important to our understanding of the Dhegihan speakers, but no direct evidence for their emanat ing from there has been forthcoming. At one time, it seemed that there was a close relationship be tween the occupants of those sites and the prob able Kansa occupations at the King Hill and Fan ning sites located in and near St. Joseph, Missouri. Now, given an opportunity to see the broader range of Caborn-Welborn ceramics, the comparable ele ments seen years ago are subsumed within a greater whole that offers far less suggestion of direct rela tionship. Caborn-Welborn sites (Green and Munson 1978; Pollack et al. 1996) date from perhaps as early as the fourteenth century. A few have pro duced early European trade items, suggesting that some Caborn-Welborn components were occupied into the late seventeenth century. The Dhegiha were closely tied linguistically (Dorsey 1884, 1885; Nuttall 1980:93; Parks and Rankin 2001), but by the twentieth century Omaha Ponca, Osage-Kansa, and Quapaw were suffi ciently different to be regarded as single languages (Parks and Rankin 2001:100). How comparable the Omaha-Ponca and Osage-Kansa groupings were by the twentieth century is debatable. La Flesche (1932) states unequivocally that Omaha-Ponca and Osage-Kansa were mutually intelligible while some Osages stated shortly after that time that they could understand Omaha-Ponca only with diffi culty, and simply could not communicate with the Quapaw (Parks and Rankin 2001:100). La Flesche, an Omaha, probably had a distinct advantage over the Osages if only because he had researched and written extensively about them, including prepa ration of the Osage language dictionary cited above. The linguistic relationships suggested above con form closely to the known tribal positions and pat terns of interaction recorded at the contact period. Timing of the Dhegihan-speakers' fissions has been researched intensively, usually employing the principles of glottochronology. Hoffman (1990:211-212) cites several glottochronological efforts suggesting that the Quapaw separated from the other Dhegiha at times ranging from AD 950 to as late as AD 1513. For a host of reasons, we tend toward accepting dates from perhaps as early as AD 1300 for this split. That the Quapaw sepa rated from the other tribal entities first is generally agreed upon by those who have studied Dhegihan linquistics and migration legends; beyond that, separation times for the remaining tribes are not known. Until they appear in the contact period, it is impossible to cite any archaeologically-defined cultural manifestation or manifestations that logi cally link prehistoric Dhegihan-speakers to the tribal entities first described in the historic record. Perhaps, armed as we are with a series of radiocar bon assays for the Blood Run site (see Table 4.2, this volume), it may offer the best possible loca tion to look into the prehistoric past of any of the Dhegihan tribes, specifically the Omaha and Ponca tribes from ca. AD 1500. For the Osage (Chapman et al. 1985), the Kansa (Henning 1993; W. Wedel 1959), and the Quapaw (Hoffman 1990; Young and Hoffman 2001), the questions of antecedents lack verifiable answers. Seeking a single archaeologi cal tradition that was the cultural ancestor to all of the Dhegihan-speakers seems an impossible task at this time. Quapaw archaeology and ethnogenesis have been investigated by Hoffman (1990) and Young and Hoffman (2001), who employ both migration legends and historic references to identify their lo cations during the early contact period. While their villages were obviously near the mouth of the Ar kansas River where they were visited by Marquette and Jolliet in AD 1673 (Young and Hoffman 2001:497), not one site there is universally accepted as Quapaw. A late Mississippian Quapaw phase has been suggested in the literature, but it is too broadly defined and includes remains not related to the Quapaw tribe (Hoffman 1990). We simply do not know what kinds of village remains were left by the Quapaw or precisely where they were, and thus have no way of identifying any traditional elements they might have brought to the mouth of the Ar kansas when they settled there. 394</page><page sequence="15">Dale R. Henning and Thomas D. Thiessen Regional Prehistory Osage historical accounts and archaeology afford us definite site locations in the headwaters of the Osage drainage system and along the Mis souri River in central Missouri. Chapman (1985:2) offers information about four well-documented Osage sites in Missouri and their times of occupa tion: Plattner (Little Osage) ca. AD 1723-1790; Hayes (Little Osage) ca. AD 1790-1815; Brown (Grand Osage) ca. AD 1675-1777; Carrington (Grand Osage) ca. AD 1777-1825. Apparently, the Little Osage left the Grand Osage on the Brown site at about AD 1723, moving to the Plattner site along the Missouri River in central Missouri. At about the same time, the Missouris left their an cestral home at the Utz site and established them selves at the Gumbo Point site, very near the Little Osages. The Little Osages then dominated the fur trade in the lower Missouri River valley until they returned to the Osage River headwaters, taking up residence at the Hayes site. The documented Osage sites offer us good data about their material culture. Unfortunately for those of us interested in specifics about traditional Os age material culture, we find that most of the ex cavated remains on these sites are Euro-American trade materials. Obviously, by the time the Osage first settled in the Osage River headwaters, they had established excellent trade relationships with whites, far better than any of their immediate neigh bors. By the late seventeenth century, when they occupied the Brown site, their prehistoric material culture tradition was all but erased by this success, leaving us with a small sample of shell-tempered pottery with very characteristic incised lines and a few chipped stone implements, just a shadow of their traditional ways. Osage village locations prior to AD 1675 are not known. Kansa archaeology has received a great deal of attention, but is far less conclusive than that of their linguistic counterparts, the Osage and Omaha/ Ponca. Even Kansa evolution is debated; Johnson (1991) favors an in situ evolution of the Kansa in eastern Kansas while Vehick (1993) and Henning (1993), at times following different lines of rea soning, conclude that Kansa origins lie in the Mis sissippi valley. Some details about the earliest sites attributed to the Kansa are offered below in order to define differences between their known patterns of interaction and those of the Blood Run villag ers. The Doniphan site (W. Wedel 1959:98-130) is a well-documented principal village of the Kansa, probably occupied when they were visited by De Bourgmond in 1724. Wedel excavated at Doniphan in 1937 but did not find the Oneota remains he expected. Eleven graves, some of which were ac companied by white trade goods, were all identi fied as eighteenth century Kansa burials. The two houses excavated, on the other hand, identified by Wedel with the Nebraska phase or Nebraska cul ture, may predate the burials. Fourteen cache or trash pits, most of which yielded some white trade items, did not afford that material culture link be tween the historic and the protohistoric-prehistoric past that Wedel had hoped for. The artifacts recov ered were a generalized lot characterized by metal and glass trade items, late-style socketed and grooved club heads, some crude shell-tempered pottery, some pieces of protohistoric Pawnee pot tery (Lower Loup, probably from east-central Ne braska), and some catlinite. If this material repre sents the Kansa of ca.AD 1724, it suggests almost total replacement of their traditional material cul ture and may also suggest significantly fewer num bers and a far less robust culture than is indicated at Osage sites of that period or, for that matter, at the earlier (probably Kansa) Fanning and King Hill sites. Both the Fanning and King Hill sites offered good evidence for the inhabitant's prehistoric cul tural tradition, along with some historic items. But neither site is conclusively identified with any tribal unit in early historic accounts; it is only by loca tion, time of occupation and culture content that these sites are tentatively assigned to the Kansa. The culture content of both sites suggests contemporaneity with Blood Run and probably with some Okoboji phase components as well. The Fanning site (W. Wedel 1959:131-171) is in northeastern Kansas on a narrow ridge above Wolf Creek valley, a few miles west of St. Joseph, Missouri. It probably covers less than 4 ha (10 acres). An Oneota site, it is tentatively attributed to Kansa occupation before about AD 1700 (W. Wedel 1959:171). The one dwelling excavated at Fanning is a circular earthlodge. No cemetery or 395</page><page sequence="16">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Vol. 49, No. 192, Memoir 36, 2004 mounds were found here; burials were not encoun tered. The shell-tempered pottery is characteristic of the generalized Oneota jar form. Much of it is very hard, well-made and plain, decorated only with tool and finger tip impressions and punctates on the lip with some trailed line motifs on the shoul der. Some of the shoulder motifs are embellished with zones of short trailed lines or punctuates, a characteristic of Allamakee Trailed pottery of the Orr phase. Most jars have two opposed strap or loop handles, often attached well below the lip. A few sherds from Fanning are identified as charac teristic of Lower Loup sites in east central Ne braska. Two shell-tempered rim sherds would be considered Lower Loup except for the uncharac teristic temper. These pieces suggest contact with the Pawnees, a relationship borne out by early his toric accounts. Wedel offers detailed descriptions of artifacts recovered from Fanning. The triangular arrow points, many end scrapers, side scrapers, flake knives and some bifaces are generally made of blue-gray, sometimes banded, chert that he believes came from the Flint Hills limestone beds of the lower Blue River drainage. The ground stone in ventory includes grinding slabs, manos, a celt, paired sandstone shaft abrader fragments, sand stone sharpening or flintknapping tools, clinker or pumice abraders, pitted stones, rubbing stones, a sinew stone and pounding stones. A few pieces of worked catlinite, including fragments of three pipes and a pipe blank, were also recovered. Bison scapula digging tools and fragments are common. A bison scapula knife or scraper, shaft straighten ers made of bison rib, a knife handle (slotted, prob ably for insertion of a metal blade), bone needle fragments and awls, bone tubes, socketed deer ant ler tine projectile points and an antler hammer were also recovered. A few historic items, including iron knife blades and iron fragments, small brass ob jects including coils, cones, tubes, circlets or "fringe clips" and two blue glass beads were found. The King Hill site is on a hilltop in St. Joseph, Missouri, overlooking the Missouri River bottom land to the west. Excavations conducted in two seasons under Henning's direction explored sev eral storage/refuse pits and 2.13 m (7 feet) of midden beneath ca. 1.22 m (4 feet) of recent fill (Henning 1998a:392-393; Raish 1979; Ruppert 1974; Shippee 1967). The midden was created by repeated depositions of village refuse in a deep erosional ditch into which some storage/refuse pits had been dug. Much of the King Hill site has been destroyed by construction activities, but small por tions remain. A reliable size estimate is impossible, but it is very doubtful that it was larger than Fan ning. A few burials have been found in parts of the village site, but no cemetery has been found. No houses were located. Ruppert (1974), on the basis of his detailed faunal study, suggests that the site was occupied continuously and intensively for per haps less than 25 years. Faunal remains suggest broad-based extrapolation patterns of aquatic re sources, upland resources and two annual bison hunts (Ruppert 1974). Bison constituted the major meat source; deer and dog were also important. Cultigens from King Hill have been analyzed (Blake and Cutler 1982) suggesting that corn is principally eastern eight-row with some North American pop and Mexican pyramidal dent or coni cal dent. Some beans, squash, bottle gourd, water melon seeds and one deeply-buried peach pit of the type introduced by the Spanish into the Ameri can southwest have also been recovered. Blake and Cutler also identified hazelnut, hickory, black wal nut, pawpaw, wild plum, wild grape, blackberry or raspberry, wild sunflower and acorn, all readily available near the site. Chenopodium, amaranth and marsh elder, all native cultigens expected on Oneota sites, were not noted. Pottery from King Hill (Raish 1979) is very similar to that from Fanning, and both samples are distinct from those in other regional Oneota con texts. Another similarity to Fanning is that a few Lower Loup sherds were also present at King Hill. The stone and bone tool industries are very similar in types and methods of manufacture to the list from Fanning and consistent with horticultural and hunt ing pursuits. Much of the raw material employed in manufacture of chipped stone tools appears to be similar. A few catlinite objects were recovered at King Hill. Historic trade items consist of small iron and brass metal objects and some glass beads, comparable in quality to trade objects from Fan ning. One native-made gunflint of local material has been recovered from the surface (Jim D. 396</page><page sequence="17">Dale R. Henning and Thomas D. Thiessen Regional Prehistory Feagins, personal communication 1994), but no gun parts are reported. It is notable that the second season of work at King Hill was done employing a waterscreen with windowscreen (1/16* inch) mesh in order to obtain microfaunal samples from the deep midden. The desired faunal sample was ob tained and, in addition, glass seed beads of several colors were found in almost every screenful of soil. The site may offer the earliest documented evi dence for traffic in these very small beads in the lower Missouri drainage system. Neither King Hill nor Fanning is a well-docu mented Kansa site. De Bourgmond traveled through the region in 1714 (Norall 1988:24-26), and again in 1724 (Norall 1988:59-67) when he probably visited the Kansa village at Doniphan, but noted no other Kansa villages in this locale on either voyage. The record of the 1714 voyage is simply a precise cartographic record of his jour ney with little information about the native inhab itants or their locations. A pre-1714 date is sug gested for these putative Kansa village sites. Fanning and King Hill site occupants obvi ously interacted with the prehistoric Pawnee. Not only are Lower Loup style ceramics found on these sites, but Grange (1968) records several Oneota sherds from Lower Loup components, including the Barcal, Wright, Burkett, Phil Cuba, Ashland (Occupation C), and Gray sites. None of these sites is historically documented as Pawnee, but the af filiations are clear on the basis of the pottery ele ments described, regional associations, and his ju dicious application of the direct historical approach. The few shell-tempered rimsherds found at Lower Loup sites compare favorably with those from Fan ning and King Hill. Small European trade items have been recovered from both sites along with, at King Hill, the watermelon seeds and peach pit men tioned above. These items probably arrived at King Hill and Fanning through down-the-line exchange rather than direct contact with white traders. The watermelons and peaches probably came down the-line from the southwest, perhaps through the Pawnee. It should be noted at this juncture that no Lower Loup pottery, watermelon seeds or peach pits have been recovered from the Blood Run site, clearly suggesting that the trade interrelationships exhibited there are quite different from the prob able Kansa sites located a few hundred miles to the south. Ponca archaeology is not well known. The first clear identification of the tribe as a separate entity dates 1785 (Wood 1993), when they were located between the mouth of the Niobrara and Ponca Creek (Henning 1977). They remained in the vi cinity of Ponca Creek from the 1790s well into the nineteenth century (Howard 1965). Wood (1960) ties his component B at Ponca Fort and the Red bird focus (Wood 1956, 1965) to Ponca occupa tions. Johnson (1998) includes the Ponca in the Coalescent tradition. Pottery from these sites im plies close ties to both the Pawnee and Arikara and suggests that Ponca ceramics had been adopted from those contacts, but most artifacts recovered archaeologically are items of white trade. Howard (1965) stresses the close ethnographic, ethnohistoric and linguistic relationships between the Ponca and the Omaha. These relationships can not be visualized through the archaeological in ventories available at this time, but should always be considered when deriving cultural relationships. For more information on the Ponca, see Buffalohead, this volume. Information about traditional Omaha material culture can be obtained with the highest degree of confidence through excavations at the Blood Run site, discussed in Chapters 4 and 5. While we be lieve that the principal occupants of this site were the Omaha/Ponca, ethnohistoric accounts and maps (Fletcher and La Flesche 1911; Tucker 1942: Plate 15; Wedel 1981,1986) place other groups, includ ing the Ioway, Arikara and Cheyenne, there or nearby at times. The ceramic sample, discussed in detail in Chapter 5, certainly reflects the presence of the Ioway. Pottery characteristic of the Initial Coalescent (early Arikara), also discussed in Chap ter 5, is recorded both from the surface and from excavated pit features. While the Ioway, Oto, Arikara and Cheyenne are frequently mentioned in accounts of relationships of various kinds (Fletcher and La Flesche 1911), the relationships with the latter two tribes were not always peace ful. While Arikara ceramic styles are reflected in the pottery from Blood Run, the examples are far fewer than those suggesting ties to the Ioway and, 397</page><page sequence="18">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Vol. 49, No. 192, Memoir 36, 2004 possibly, the Oto. As for the Cheyenne relation ships, we have to rely strictly on the accounts of Fletcher and La Flesche because no recognized elements suggesting a Cheyenne presence on Blood Run have been isolated in the archaeological re mains. Unfortunately, it has not been possible to separate 'real' Omaha/Ponca archaeological re mains from those attributable to the Ioway and Arikara. By 1714(Norall 1988:108-109), the principal village of the Omaha was near the confluence of the White and Missouri Rivers in South Dakota, suggesting that they had vacated Blood Run and had split with the Ponca. By the time (1775-1845) the Omaha were found at the Big Village in east ern Nebraska, their material culture was dominated by white trade items (O'Shea and Ludwickson 1992:17). 398</page></plain_text>
