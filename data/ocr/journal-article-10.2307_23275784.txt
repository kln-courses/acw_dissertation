H. Sackett, J. A. MacGillivray and J. Driessen, under the auspices of the British School at Athens. The work was supervised by the Greek Archaeological Service, and the 24th Ephoreia of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities, under the direction of Vily Apostolakou and Chrysa Sofianou. Funding was provided in large part by the Institute for Aegean Prehistory and generous private donors. Trench supervisors were S. Thorne, H. Davis, S. Hemingway, I. Grundon, J. Doole, E. Hatzaki, L. Tabac, K. Walsh, A. Haesendonckx, T. Cunningham, J. Mason, A. Marcar, P. Tomkins, S. Wallace, M. Naunton, I. Schoep, A. Collar, P. Westlake and C. Briault. Video notebooks, invaluable during the study process, were kept by N. Henry, S. MacGillivray, S. Moss and A. Lesk. N. Daskalakis served as foreman for the first four seasons, J. Millidakis for the last. J. Driessen served as site architect, assisted by P.Jerome and E. Roberts. Site plans are by J. Driessen with T. Cunningham, digitised by C. Rossion. Sections were drawn by trench masters under supervision of L. H. Sackett, except Section A drawn by L. H. Sackett; all were digitised by S. Goddard. Initial conservation of finds was by P. Harrison, A. Brysbaert, M. Naunton, M. Tziotziou, V. Zachariou and E. Anaplioti; final conservation was by E. Anaplioti assisted by S. Giannikidis. Post-excavation analysis of the pottery was initiated by J. A. MacGillivray and taken up by the authors from 2000 onwards. For the figures we owe much to S. Goddard of the University of Exeter; he drew and inked pottery, digitised the section drawings, and generally provided excellent advice on preparing illustrations. Pottery drawing was also done by A. Collar, P. Murray, D. Riccardi-Percy, and F. Evenson, who also inked a large proportion of the drawings. Object photography was by S. Goddard and C. Knappett, with site photography by L. H. Sackett. Further assistance in scanning material for the figures was provided by S. Giannikidis and C. Jeffra. Block M produced an enormous amount of pottery; approximately six tons were strewn, processed and studied over the four study seasons between 2004 and 2007. In this we were helped by the following students from the Department of Archaeology at the University of Exeter: K. Madigan, M. Midwinter, J. Adkins, L. Price, E. Govier, H. Tuck, E. Dismorr, T. Rendell, S. Harding, M. Cox, K. Sweet, F. Ward and N. Hughes. The site guard A. Beniamakis provided considerable assistance too in transporting the zembils from storage, and H. Parton oversaw the storage and organisation of the studied material. The final writing up was facilitated by a period of research leave awarded to one of the authors (CK) by the AHRC Research Leave Scheme. Further support came from the Department of Art at the University of Toronto, the University of Exeter, who granted a sabbatical and, in the early stages, from Christ's College, Cambridge. CK is extremely grateful to J. Driessen and the Universite Catholique de Louvain, where he was a visiting charge de cours during his research leave. We also thank the reviewers of the manuscript for their invaluable comments and insights; Rayna Andrew for skilfully formatting the volume; and the Series Editor of BSA Supplementary Volumes, Olga Krzyszkowska, for her patience and tireless work in shepherding this and many other BSA volumes to completion. February 2 012 XV</page><page sequence="13">Chapter 1 Introduction This volume presents the results of excavation of a town block — Block M — in the Minoan settlement of Palaikastro. Its position in the town is shown in fig. 1.1 (see also plate i). Unlike the individual buildings (1, 3, 4, 5 and 7) also recently excavated at the site that are to appear in due course in this same publication series, Block M is a group of buildings (and of course we may speculate as to the social nature of a block, probably beyond a single family or household). A plan of Block M can be found in fig. 1.2. We use the term 'block' following the first excavators of the site in the 1900s, although in the preliminary reports of the 1990s it was usually referred to as Area 6. We should also make clear that 'Building 6', a term we shall substitute with Southeast Building, refers to the major building in Block M, forming its se part. The other buildings in the Block are the Northwest and the Southwest Buildings (see fig. 1.2, and Chapter 2). We present the vast majority of the evidence from this block. The two wells 576 and 605, valuable for their LM IB—III sequence, are exceptions, having already been published in a BSA Supplementary Volume.1 These wells were constructed and used once the building as such had fallen out of use, and so it was appropriate to publish them separately. And as mentioned above, there have been preliminary reports and other publications concerning Area and Building 6. We will re-present the material covered in the preliminary reports, in some cases altering chronology and interpretations, inevitable in the light of a final contextual study. Why this volume? Well, at one level, there is a straightforward obligation to publish what has been excavated. Yet this simply begs another question: why excavate? Why was Block M excavated? Which begs an even wider question: why excavate at Palaikastro at all? It may be useful here to place Block M in as wide a context as possible. THE CRETAN BRONZE AGE AND PALAIKASTRO The Bronze Age of Crete occupies a unique position in Mediterranean prehistory: it sees the first island development of early state societies, focussed around palatial and urban centres. For over a century, centres such as Knossos, Phaistos and Malia have been intensively investigated, with the result that the 'emergence of civilisation' on Crete is relatively well understood. The continuous occupation sequences at these sites allow us to chart the long-term development of social practices and institutions with a degree of resolution largely unmatched elsewhere in the Mediterranean. However, the concentration of these sites in the centre of the island means that they do not tell us the whole story, given that pronounced regional variation is an integral part of the island's Bronze Age settlement history. While the Bronze Age of the far west of the island is still quite poorly known, there are many sites known in the east; yet few among them provide evidence for continuity throughout the Bronze Age. One exception is Palaikastro, where excavated contexts span the entire period from EM I to LM IIIC. Such a sequence provides an excellent opportunity for investigating long-term social trajectories in a 'peripheral' region. Although the site of Palaikastro is itself well known, having first been excavated in 1902, detailed publication of key occupation phases has been lacking until recently. This is where we can bring Block M into focus. Not only is it a large area of the site, covering c. 2000 m2, it has an important advantage over other areas so far excavated: it has barely any 'reoccupation' in LM III, and so sees excellent preservation of some key early phases that are otherwise difficult to isolate. It provides us with excellent evidence for occupation through the Middle and Late Bronze Age, particularly for the MM II, MM III and LM IA periods. The principal construction horizon is in MM III, a period that is very poorly known in East Crete generally.2 Block M therefore offers a unique regional window on some of the formative phases in 'the emergence of civilisation' in Bronze Age Crete, with the potential to shed new light on themes such as urban development, island settlement dynamics, and regional political geography. This is the broader justification for devoting resources to the publication of Block M. 1 PK Wells. 2 See Macdonald and Knappett forthcoming. 1</page><page sequence="14">2 PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN ORGANISATION OF THE VOLUME We begin by presenting the architecture and stratigraphy in Chapter 2. We cover each of the three buildings within the Block in turn, starting with the Southeast Building (Rooms 1-18), moving on to the Southwest Building (Rooms 19-33) and finishing with the Northwest Building (Rooms 34-65). In each of the rooms we isolate distinct contexts, and give these a numerical sequence within each room: so in Room 6, for example, we may have Contexts 6.1, 6.2, etc. We provide architectural descriptions for each room and stratigraphical information for each context, accompanied by plans and sections. All contexts are assigned a relative date (e.g. MM IIIA) based on a combination of stratigraphical information and pottery analysis. The details of the pottery and of other finds, however, we save for subsequent chapters. Before the ceramic and other finds are presented, we provide in Chapter 3 an overview of the main pottery types, fabrics, wares and styles encountered in the Block M assemblages. This then leads into Chapters 4, 5 and 6, where we discuss the pottery by context and period. Chapter 4 is devoted to the various contexts from Block M assigned to the Pre- and Protopalatial periods (EM IIB-MM IIB); Chapter 5 is dedicated to the MM IIIA and MM IIIB periods, Chapter 6 to the LM IA period. The pottery catalogue is organised by context within each of these chapters, and a running numerical sequence is provided throughout the three chapters. That is to say, the Pre- and Protopalatial pottery catalogue consists of numbers 1-157, the MM III pottery runs from 158 to 673, and the LM IA from 674 to 974. This is designed for ease of use, such that any scholar wishing to see all the MM III pottery together, for example, may do so, while at the same time all the necessary contextual information is also readily available. Subsequently, Chapter 7 deals with the Reoccupation (here LM IB-IIIB) in the NW area of Block M, Chapter 8 (by Don Evely) presents the small finds, and Chapter 9 (by Polly Westlake) the plaster. In each of these chapters the catalogued items are given separate running sequences. One final specialist report included here is the tephra analysis by Max Bichler. Environmental finds will be treated fully in a subsequent volume that pulls together all faunal and botanical material from across Buildings 1 - 7; those working on this are Anaya Sarpaki (archaeobotany), Dimitra Mylona (fish bone) and Sheilagh Wall-Crowther (animal bone).</page><page sequence="15">DE I DF I DG I DH I DJ I DK I DL I DM I DN I DP I DQ I DR f OS I DT I DU I DV I EA I EB I EC I ED !

During the second campaign of excavation, in 1962, the word 'house' was used since the main focus of work in the town had been a clearly delineated single building (House N).2 Likewise, the latest series of investigations, starting in 1986 (following a survey season in 1983), immediately uncovered what was unmistakably a single, discrete structure — though the term 'building' rather than house was now preferred as it left open the possibility of supra domestic function.3 In order to link the excavated buildings — 1 through 5 — with the old excavations, in 1990 and 1991 trenches were opened in what the original excavators had called Block M (figs. 1.1-1.2; plates 1-2; plan 1). It was clear, particularly following further seasons of work in 1994, 1996 and 2003, that this area (known variously as Area 6, Building 6 and now Block M) represented a different way of structuring and distributing enclosed space; that despite the many years, the new techniques and approaches that lay between the work of the beginning of the 20th century and the work at its end, the differences in terminology were simply the result of differences in ancient architectural realities. The point needs to be stressed as differences in archaeological terminology do not always reflect such clear differences in what lies in the ground. Why were town blocks located along Main Street, and upslope, at least along Street T-E where Blocks E and X were located? The most obvious answer remains the most plausible hypothesis: these represent familial or clan holdings of the most important residents of the town.4 The fate of Block M — to be stripped and (largely) vacant for nearly the whole of the LBA — likewise suggests that property was identified more strongly with intangible attributes — whether ownership, taboo, superstition, story, myth — than tangible (e.g. location, usefulness, practical value). This holds true even when considering the eventual use of the plot: the two wells dug in LM IB5 obviously do not 'occupy' the entire space of Block M in any physical sense. We find within Block M three reasonably discrete units, though not all entirely preserved, nor fully excavated. The most clearly defined of these is the Southeast Building (fig. 2.1) referred to in previous publications as Building 6.6 While early remains suggest activity and construction virtually throughout the Block in the Protopalatial period, the Southeast Building does seem to be the first and most significant of these constructions. Remains pointing to a still earlier building, perhaps MM IB-IIA in date, do not suggest that the full plot was used. Some of these remains, such as a fine plaster floor below the paved colonnade in Room 9a, an earlier wall (on slightly different alignment) below the polythyron in Room 3, and early wall remnants in Rooms 12b, 13, and 18, while suggesting such a building, seem distinct in orientation, outline and scale from the subsequent construction. This construction began with a major infilling operation, during which massive quantities of broken pottery, small stones and earth were deposited throughout the SE quarter of the building as well as below later Rooms 9b and 13. The construction took place probably sometime in MM IIB, as none of the sherds (hundreds of kilograms worth) is later than MM IIA. The quality of these sherds, the high incidence of decorated pottery and the inclusion of figurine fragments do suggest a source for the material of similar status to the building they went on to support. Coincident with this operation was the creation of a drainage system, with two major drains leading out of the building, joining with a drain running along Street B-M to the E. Given evidence from the 1905 excavations, where an earlier, MM I-IIA structure below Block X projected out into in Main Street,7 suggesting that Main Street did not exist before MM IIB, we must associate the 1 PKII, 277. 2 PK VI, passim. 3 PK 1986. 4 Cunningham 2007, 102; also Driessen and MacGillivray 1989, 108. 5 PK Wells. 6 E.g.

Thus the main construction phase within Block M is an integral part of what could be the most audacious and far-reaching building programme ever seen at the site. It is at this time that Main Street takes form and that the massive, monumental façades and outlines of the grand Main Street Blocks are first laid out (plate 2). In Block M the se quarter is cleared of debris down to an EM IIB level and then shored up with as much as a metre of heavy sherd and stone fill. The drainage system, incorporating the large and well-built drains in Rooms 12a and 10b (plate 3) as well as the enclosed drain running along the E façade, is installed; as are ashlar walls on the s (assumed) and E where they would ornament the major streets.8 Fine schist floors are laid in Rooms 8 and 3; the court is laid out and paved with massive sideropetra slabs and fitted with columns. It may be that the large white limestone slabs at room 9b were installed at this point also (based on the construction detail and fill date) though indications of some phasing in construction may suggest these slabs belong to a rebuilding at a second stage. The pottery in the construction fills is never later than MM IIA; so we assign a date of MM IIB to the first phase of construction. We do not find the destruction deposits at the end of MM IIB that are known from other East Cretan sites like Petras, Malia or Myrtos-Pyrgw, and our first deposits are generally already MM IIIA, so the building may have continued in use largely unchanged into that period. However, some modifications, like the addition of the limestone slabs of Room 9b could feasibly have been carried out in early MM IIIA rather than MM IIB; if so, following closely the lines of an MM IIB building. This MM IIB-IIIA construction did then suffer a destruction at the end of MM IIIA, and we see numerous deposits across the Block attesting to this; after some modifications the building continued in use until a major seismic event at the end of MM HIB destroyed the building. The initial construction event is notable in three respects: first, the transformation affected seemingly 'public' and 'private'9 areas simultaneously and to a similar degree, suggesting the same work-teams raising façades and installing drains were working on the streets and houses at the same time; second, the scale of the operations alone was perhaps grander than the scale of the buildings that had preceded them; and thirdly, the unification of the largest structures within a coherent street and drainage system renders into stone and earth a conjoined and egalitarian relationship between the multi-person entities comprised by the new constructions — a profound transformation even if that relationship preceded said construction.10 These three attributes suggest to us that this transformation of the town at Roussolakkos was in no small way affected by supra-regional forces. This is not to imply coercion11 — the work must surely have been voluntary and the idiosyncrasies of the local traditions make it clear that local agents acted for themselves — but their interests were perhaps to join a larger political or economic unit.12 In light of this the particular architectural forms chosen for the Southeast Building — ashlar walls, mosaiko paving (in Room 8), red plaster in imitation of veined marble, and what may be an early form of a Minoan Hall13 — might be connected to the Block's eventual fate, suggesting a close and perhaps complicated relationship with the centre of the island, and notably the site of Knossos, which starts to exercise considerable supra-regional power as of MM IIIA.14 8 Part of the original ashlar façade is still preserved at the s of the street (Block D), though most has been quarried out (much quite recently, during the WW II occupation, cf. PK VIL, 204) but no trace of ashlar remains at the N side (at Block M), where it seems to have been replaced in the LM IB period, at least at the Southeast Building, by a build of small regular blocks. The extraordinary preservation of the LM III street surface of this whole stretch of Main Street, with a veneer of cut sandstone paving slabs (plate 4 c, and notes on a street test in PK 1994/6) suggests that such material was close at hand from a fallen façade, presumably that of Block M. Nowhere to our knowledge does a comparable town street rate such treatment; and it seems unlikely that a special quarry assignment would have been ordered for such work. 9 Terms used as a convenience; here 'private' refers to the houses or built covered spaces; 'public' to the streets or opens spaces that contain more than a single house. 10 For the notion that the Blocks at Palaikastro may have represented supra-household units, see Cunningham 2007, 102, io7 and fig. 11.6; that these might have had the character of 'Houses' in Levi-Strauss's terms, see Driessen 2010a. On the importance of treating 'houses' (material) and 'Houses' (social) as co-constructed, see Vellinga 2007. 11 For a discussion of corporate strategies in Bronze Age Crete see Cunningham and Driessen 2004, 106-10. 12 Knappett 2011. 13 On Minoan Halls, see Graham 1972, 94-g; Driessen 1982, 199g; Palyvou 200g, 182-4; as discussed below, while perhaps functionally identical, Rooms 3 and 9a do not form a canonical Minoan Hall as originally defined by Driessen. 14 E.g. Knappett and Nikolakopoulou 2008; Macdonald and Knappett forthcoming. For the idea that central Cretan links may have been involved in the abandonment of the Block see Driessen 1999 ('Knossians Go Home'). As the article was written prior to the inception of the ceramic study, Driessen assumed a date of LM IA for the remains. While the chronology has obviously changed, the thesis remains compelling.</page><page sequence="29"></page><page sequence="30"></page><page sequence="31">Fig. 2.1.

SOUTHEAST BUILDING (figs. 2.1-2.32; plates 1-12; plans 1-2) Room ia Room ia lies in the SE corner of the building (figs. 2.1-2.3, and PLATE 4). Wall 707 is a LM IB addition and wall 719, the robbed ashlar E fagade for the Southeast Building, seemed to corner at Wall 711; also the South Fagade Wall 702 is a later rebuild. Consequently we do not know the exact dimensions or precise outlines of this space as originally conceived, and Room 1 a may be part of an entrance system and may have been partly external. At the w, Wall 627 was 60 cm wide and preserved to a height of 45 cm, and relatively well built with two good faces. The cross-wall 711 was 45 cm wide with a low bench (or perhaps simply a shoring-up) adding 35 cm to this. It is tempting to reconstruct the paved area as the vestibule of an entrance in this early phase15 (while we do not know how far it extended to the w, we know it did not cover the full space); otherwise perhaps the entrance lay to the N at Rooms 11 or 12. The earliest level in Room ia is actually a dense stony matrix yielding a few tiny EM sherds and bits of charcoal; when initially excavated this was considered to be sterile bedrock as it was so hard packed. This has not been assigned a context number, but a similar horizon found in Rooms lb (Context ib.i) and 11a suggests that the area was cleared down to this level prior to the major construction in MM IIB. Above this layer on the w side of Room ia is a substantial MM IIA fill (Context ia.i), the same that lies beneath much of the building (including Room 11a). The earliest feature in the E part of the room is a stone paving at Ti 1.19 (Context ia.2\ plate 4 a). It is composed of small to medium-sized sideropetra slabs and ran under both the LM IB Wall 707 and the late South Fagade 702, indicating that this may have been a paved external space or vestibule. There was no plaster in the interstices of the slab paving, unlike pavings in Rooms 8, 3, and 9. The pottery on the slab paving is datable to MM IIA. In the w part of the room this slab paving is not found, but instead a trodden earth floor a little higher at c. 11.27T (Context ia.3). This floor also ran 15 Note the paved vestibule of Block B 14 (fig. 1.1); also PK /, pi. xx.</page><page sequence="34">BLOCK M ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY w Room 1a &lt;2jj&gt; r^ (in elevation; projected from S) Street B-M Q2 1.

Although the floor was at a height similar to the preserved top of Wall 711 it stopped along the line of the wall, suggesting a wall of pise above the stone foundation. As in neighbouring rooms, the levels associated with the first construction episodes in MM II are not followed by any MM III levels connected with the main use of the building. This is presumably because there were no destruction deposits preserved in these rooms. Thus the next, and latest, levels we encounter are from the LM IA phase: Context ia.4 from inside the room, Context ia.5 from outside, in Street B-M. In both the pottery is largely datable to LM IA, with some modern contamination, probably associated with the 1902-06 excavations. CONTEXT lA.i: MM IIA FILL (#4459-70) At the w side of the room there was no paving, and below the floor (Context ia.3) we come straight down onto a substantial MM IIA fill (enough to cover c. 10 tables), such as was found throughout the Southeast Building. The fill was contained by Walls 711 and 627. CONTEXT 1A.2: MATERIAL ON PAVING AT ll.igT (#5708-10) (FIG. 2.3: 7; PLATE 4 fl) At the E side of the room a thin layer containing MM II pottery sits on a paved floor that runs under Walls 707 and 702. The top stone course of Wall 711 is visible at this point, dividing rooms 1a and lb. Above this context lies the plaster and earth floor at 11.27! (Context ia.3). CONTEXT IA.3: MATERIAL ON EARTH/PLASTER FLOOR AT II.27T (#5706, (4453-54, contaminated), 4545-46) (figs. 2.3: 6; plate 4 a) This context captures material on an earthen floor preserved to the N and w of the 1904 trenches. There were several patches of plaster preserved, so it may have been fully plastered and may well be associated with the (somewhat higher) white plaster floor to the N (Context ib.^)\ this higher plaster floor stopped along the line of Wall 711 which had been built up in pise. In the w part of the room the earthen floor sat directly on the MM IIA fill (Context ia.i), while in the SE corner it ran over the paving stones (Context ia.2). There was no floor deposit; the latest sherds are LM IA but there was much contamination and disturbance (e.g. plate 2 b).</page><page sequence="35">io PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN context 1A.4: UPPER levels (#5699 (with a modern bullet casing), 5700-05, 5707 (modern iron), 5719-20, 5723, 5726, 5728, 4420-32, 4441-44, 4446-52, 4457, 4536~ 44&gt; 4552) (fig. 2.3: 3, 4, 5; plate 2 b) This material appears to comprise topsoil and backfill from excavations in 1904; these trenches ran along Walls 702 and 707 but were not always immediately recognised (see also Room lb and plate 2 b). The pottery is mostly LM IA, with some limited LM III in the w portion (#40008 series); these zembils also extended into Room 2 and will be cross-listed there as well. Apart from the modern contamination, this seems post-occupation accumulation/re-deposition of primarily LM IA material. Room ib (fig. 2.2; plate 4) Divided from Room 1 a by Wall 711, Room 1 b is defined to the E by Wall 719, which was robbed out from the street side (as the backing stones and floor were not disturbed by the operation). The pottery from the robbing trench is LM IA in style (see Context ib.4) but the robbing may have been associated with the construction of Wall 707 in early LM IB. A broken ashlar block was left behind in the robbing pit atop the socle, confirming the suspicion that 719 was originally in ashlar (plate 4 b). To the N, Wall 535 is 45 cm wide with a good N face; it bonds with Wall 530 (n-s wall N of 535) and has a return to the s where it meets the se slab in Room gb. Like Room 1a, this room also has a plaster floor, though a little higher up, at Ti 1.40-11.50 (plate 4 a). An inverted conical cup of LM IA type was lying on this floor (Context ib.3); this provides a terminus ante quem for the floor, which we suspect to be much earlier. The plaster floor had been laid over a bedding of murex shells, as elsewhere in this part of the building, and rested directly on the thick and dense sherd and stone fill (Context ib.2). This operation goes with the construction of Wall 719. Finally, below the fill was a surface of tightly packed earth and pebbles, with a single pottery sherd datable to EM II (Context ib.i). The single inverted conical cup in the middle of the room, placed at a time when the building was largely (if not entirely) out of use and subject to dismantling/looting is interesting and suggests perhaps an apotropaic or propitiatory gesture to calm the 'ghosts' of an abandoned building. This is a recurring feature of this LM iA phase in Block M. CONTEXT lB.i: PRE-BUILDING SURFACE (#6634) This is a surface of tightly packed earth with pebbles beneath the MM II fill. There is only one sherd: handmade, in a blackened fabric, from a flaring bowl, and possibly burnished. It probably belongs to EM II, which has been found in small quantities elsewhere in the area. Since the MM II fill rests directly on this layer here, as well as in Rooms 1 a and 11 a, it is likely that the area was cleared prior to the major construction in MM IIB-IIIA. CONTEXT IB.2: MM IIA FILL (#4386-92, 6626-27, 6629-33) The fill lay over the pre-building surface of Context ib.i, and below the plaster floor of Context ib.3, and produced more than a table of pottery,16 homogeneous MM IIA with few joins and few whole profiles, as typical of the fill. It revealed painted plaster too. In some cases, zembils from the uppermost layers of fill, reached immediately after cutting through the plaster floor, contained some Neopalatial pottery but in very small quantities and most likely fallen from the section or from an area where the plaster was missing. This represents yet another area of the substantial Protopalatial fill found beneath the nearby Rooms 10a, 11a and 12b. CONTEXT IB.3: MM IIB-LM IA PLASTER FLOOR AT ll.35-ll.40T (#4373, 4379, 4546) (see also Context ia.3) The plaster floor in this room lies some 10 cm higher than the floor in Room 1a, from which it is separated by a mud brick or pise partition Wall 711. There was a single inverted conical cup of LM IA type set on the floor but the majority of the pottery is MM IIA, even on top of the floor. Thus, although we know the plaster floor was exposed in LM IA, we believe it was laid much earlier, as also indicated by its state of preservation. 16 A 'table' of pottery refers to a table measuring 1 x 2 used for strewing pottery at Palaikastro.</page><page sequence="36">BLOCK M ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY CONTEXT IB.4: ROBBING PIT ON WALL 719 (#4547-48, 4550-51, 4553~55) Of these zembils, #4550, 4551, 4554 and 4555 isolate the pit fill. A robbing pit follows the line of the socle for an ashlar wall (one broken ashlar block was found in the pit atop the socle; plate 4 b). In ceramic terms this is LM IA, but as neither the plaster floor (Context ib.3, above) nor the backing stones for the ashlar were disturbed, the operation must have been carried out from the street side during the time that Wall 707 was built, and at a time after the collapse of material into the room, i.e. post-Theran eruption or early LM IB. Room 2 (figs. 2.4-2.5) Entered from the stoa (Room ga) to the N by a wide doorway (1.35 m), Room 2 measures 4x3m. The E wall 627 is solidly built with good faces on both sides. The w wall 620 is composed of small stone rubble, c. 45 cm wide and typical of an internal partition wall. The N wall 613 while not well preserved was 70 cm wide and also more carefully and strongly built. Walls are double-faced with some rubble in between and show remains of red plaster at their base. The s wall of Room 2 is 702, the street fagade which was tested deeper in this room, up to c. 80 cm below its top course: it showed an earlier wall line further down and a few cm further in than 702. From bedrock the room was filled with the typical MM IIA levelling material (Context 2.1); however in this room there was an additional layer of stone packing below the plaster floor to the N (here of reddish/orange tint — Context 2.2), and at the N at least, the same fine gravel/sand bedding material as was used for the large slabs in Room 9b. The plaster floor preserved along Wall 613 at the N was at 11.36? while a small patch along Wall 620 to the w was considerably lower, at 11.17?. Elsewhere the plaster was not preserved and a hard, patchy surface at c. 11.24T was found. The rubble and sherd fill reached as high as 11.16T so it is likely that the higher floor indicates a phase of rebuilding after the main levelling/filling operations and associated with the placement of the large limestone slab platform in Room gb. Unfortunately there were virtually no sherds in the additional stony fill layer, so there is no ceramic evidence to confirm or refute this. The bedrock was also higher in this room, as high as io.7gt. Fig. 2.4. Plan of Room 2.</page><page sequence="37">PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN 1.Topsoil 2.

CONTEXT 2.2: PLASTER FLOOR AT C. 11.40t (#4433-34) (FIG. 2.5: 4) A fragment of plaster floor was preserved along Wall 613, beneath which lay a bedding soil of tiny pebbles, the same as for the limestone slabs in Room gb. This floor must therefore belong to the same phase of construction as the platform, probably after the MM IIIA destructive event noted particularly in Room 8. context 2.3: upper levels (fig. 2.5: 3) (#4420-28) (also Room 1a) This context consists of topsoil and tumble; it is LM IA with some possible modern contamination. Room 3 (fig. 2.6; plate 5 a-c) Room 3 gives out onto the stoa and court beyond (9b) via a four-doored polythyron, with finely cut gamma- and tau- shaped piers of serpentinite. This entry system, so far unique at Palaikastro, provides access to a finely paved room of purple and green schist. At 5 x 5 m, this is the largest enclosed room in the building (only the open court, Room 9a, is larger). The E 656 and w 620 walls are of small stone rubble (unlike the w wall of Room 1, for example) and must have been pisé above this socle. As with the entire building (possibly except Room 1a), the original s façade is presumed to have run along or close to the same line as Wall 702. The schist paving was originally laid over a very stony packing, similar to our standard MM IlA levelling fill, though with much lower sherd content ( Context 3.1). At the s of the room the schist slabs were not found, only the stony rubble packing; the slabs must have been robbed out. As at Akrotiri on Thera, the jambs themselves would have been supported by a wooden frame, long since decayed, and as a result they have subsided substantially (plate 5 b).17 The 17 Palyvou 2005, 141.

Plan of Room 3. three tau-shaped jambs were each of two pieces and the gaps created by subsidence had filled in with earth. An earlier wall was noted beneath the jambs when they were lifted for conservation; no further exploration was possible but it was seen that this wall was not in alignment with the jambs (or the rest of the MM IIIA building) and, while firm evidence is lacking, it must date to MM II if not earlier. It could perhaps be tentatively associated with the orange plaster floor below the stoa (Context ga.i). ARCHITECTURAL CATALOGUE 102.101 Stone door jamb base. Serpentinite. Gamma shaped.

Palyvou describes the use of a wooden beam fixed to the jamb bases used to 'bear the pivots for the door leaves'.18 18 Palyvou 2005, 141, fig. 208.</page><page sequence="39">14 PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN Considering the lack of standardisation of these jamb bases; some one-piece, some two; some with well-formed sockets, some not; it is tempting to suppose that this rather soft stone was not particularly suitable for this feature and perhaps it is no coincidence that serpentinite door jambs are elsewhere unknown. The jamb bases, though having slipped and suffered damage from subsidence (and possibly earthquake), give fairly regular door openings of c. 70 cm at the far E and w, and 80 cm for the two central openings. Though much useful work has been done on the subject of the polythyron elsewhere,19 one detail that is rarely mentioned is that, with the doors closed, the polythyron would form a niched wall, a ubiquitous iconic indicator of an important space (either cultic or political) in both the Near East and Egypt (where the serakh or stylised niched wall forms the Royal Cartouche) from the 4th millennium bc.20 The use of wood implied here is noteworthy; at Akrotiri, Palyvou emphasises that the pier-and door partition is a 'timber load-bearing frame that usually substitutes for a wall' going on to note that 'what is striking is the amount of wood that has been used for these structures...'.21 The other direct evidence for wooden construction elements in the Southeast Building, namely the added w wall of Room 4 and the possibility of a wooden floor in Room 8, belongs to a rebuilding phase, probably at the end of MM IIIA. These pier-and-door partitions do seem to go with the first phase and hence pre-date those, but it would be interesting to see if there is an increase in wooden construction elements elsewhere on the island at this time. This space has also been considered as part of a 'Minoan Hall' combined with the stoa and open court beyond (Room 9a).22 It does not, however, correspond very closely to this fairly standardised architectural unit and while the suggestion of strong links to central Cretan elite architectural forms is appropriate, the appearance and placement suggest rather a reception room adjoining an open rectangular court, more akin to the Throne Room at Knossos or similar rooms at Zakros, Phaistos, and Malia,23 than anything in the Residential Quarter, or the town houses or 'villas' as listed by Driessen (though Nirou Chani also replaces the light well with an open court) whose 1982 definition of a Minoan Hall rests on the following spatial criteria:24 1. a large room sub-divided into three unequal parts — the largest is the inner 'hall' with a narrow forehall separated by at least one column (and hence open) from a light well; 2. axial alignment; 3. a single architectural unit; 4. multiple doors (piers) or columns separating the inner hall from the forehall; one, two or three column/s separating the forehall from the light well. Of these criteria, the only one present in the Southeast Building is the sequence of a polythyron followed by a colonnade (the stoa). The area is not a single architectural unit; it is not axially aligned; and the inner hall is the smallest rather than the largest space (even the stoa, if taken in its entirety, is larger). There is no light well at all.25 Rather, there is a central rectangular court with a stoa around it, a large, raised, paved area at one end and a series of five rooms around two of the remaining sides (the fourth seems to give onto another court); of which two are sunken and three level; one of these latter is entered by means of a polythyron with fine stone jamb bases and is paved in schist. It occupies the central part of one of the long sides of the court and is oriented ne-sw, perpendicular to the court's orientation (se-nw). As noted above, except for the presence of columns and the polythyron (which are common in all sorts of different Minoan and Minoanising architectural systems)26 none of these is attributes of the Minoan Hall. And as Driessen notes: 'Some authors use the terms Minoan Hall and polythyron indistinctly which is unfortunate.'27 In this case, it is precisely because there is a known Minoan architectural combination of a rectangular court with surrounding rooms (some sunken), stoas, and polythyra used to communicate to various rooms, that it is important to make a distinction between this arrangement and at least the 'canonical' Minoan Hall. The Southeast Building is certainly no palace; but just as the central court does not 19 Palyvou 1987; 2005; Driessen 1982. 20 Leick 1988; Moorey 1987. 21 Palyvou 2005, 144. 28 PK 1994/6', Driessen 1999; Cunningham 2002 and 2007a. 23 Graham 1972. 24 Driessen 1982, 29. 25 Light wells are a common and very clearly defined architectural feature in Minoan Crete and need not be confused with other sources of natural light; what distinguishes them spatially and why they are considered an important part of the Minoan Hall is that they give a certain amount of privacy and serve a limited series of spaces. A large court is not equivalent to a small light well; the same might also be said of the Nirou Chani arrangement. 26 Palyvou 1987. 27 Driessen 1999, 227 n. 2.</page><page sequence="40">BLOCK M ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY *5 alone make a 'palace', so too the polythyron and stoa do not make Rooms 3 and 9a a Minoan Hall.28 With the relatively early date of the Southeast Building (MM IIB-IIIA) we may indeed be seeing a forerunner or at least a similarly functioning sequence of spaces existing prior to the establishment of the canonical architectural form. Immediately below topsoil here (as in Room ga to the n) was a layer of large stone tumble, which seemed somewhat articulated (plate 5 c). This tumble was concentrated along the line of columns in ga and did seem to represent some in situ structural collapse, but with later disturbance and robbing pits. These upper layers were generally no later than LM IA but with occasional signs of LM III pits (Contexts 3.2, 3.3). CONTEXT 3.1: BELOW SCHIST PAVING (#5564-65, 6635) These lowest levels represent the levelling fill put in before the laying of the schist slabs, though this has more the character of a hard stone packing and far fewer sherds than is the case further e in the building. CONTEXT 3.2: MATERIAL ABOVE PAVED FLOOR (#2g2g, 2932, 2g35 (also Room ga), 2g37 (also ga), 2g3g (ga), 2g42, 2g44, 2g48-4g, 2gsx, 2gs7 (5652-55 a11 igo4 backfill?), 5656-58, 5660-62) This predominantly LM IA context may represent the final use of this room. Toward the street to the s, the slabs are missing and only the bedding soil remains. One small patch of Theran ash noted here means that the schist slabs to the s were robbed before the ash was deposited, demonstrating that here, as elsewhere, the building was being dismantled in LM IA. Some LM III material is also noted, with signs of robbing trenches (see below and #2gi6, 2g53 and 2g54 in Room gb) of that date as well. CONTEXT 3.3: MATERIAL FROM LM III PIT (#2g44, 2g46, 2g5g) This pit, circular in shape and rounded on the bottom, was only noticed from the level of the paving; though it did seem to have been dug from higher up. The pottery was LM IIIA2. Room 4 (figs. 2.7-2.8; plates 5-6) Entered from the stoa (Room ga) via a narrow doorway and a set of stone steps (Context 4.6), Room 4 is a sunken half-basement room in its original conception, bordered by Walls 656 to the e, 654 to the N, 702 to the s and 662 to the w. Wall 662 abuts Wall 654 where 654 corners with a return to the N. This well-built corner and the early plaster floor it contained (Context ga.1-2 in Room ga below) might represent the outline of the MM I—II precursor of the SE Building. If so, then this entire wing, consisting of Rooms 4-8, was added in MM IIIA. Wall 654 is 65 cm wide and in its earlier courses was made of large well-shaped blocks. Wall 662, 70 cm wide, has good blocks and some evident coursing lower down at either end, especially the N where it abuts 654; it is then filled in with a three stone technique: smallish, roughly rounded stones alternate with small flat stones placed on end supporting a course of largish flat slabs, though the coursing is somewhat jumbled (plate 5 a). Wall 656 is 80 cm wide and made from largish roughly rounded boulders without rigorous coursing and resembles Wall 654 to which it is bonded. At some point in the building's history, probably between MM IIIA and MM IIIB, an additional long wall, 661, was added at the w, narrowing the room and creating a narrow space referred to here as Room 5. Wall 661 is only 55 cm wide and clearly shows the gaps where wooden beams were used and betrays a distinctive construction technique with three vertical studs on each face filled in with rubble (plates 5^6 a-b). A slumping rectangular block at the N end of the wall suggests a fallen noggin piece used to span a gap between posts. The possibility exists that a stairway was located here at this time but the double wall and filled-in area may have been purely structural as well. The steps and entrance from the stoa were likewise an addition to the Room, probably also following the destruction at the end of MM IIIA. 28 There is of course an almost exact correspondence between Driessen's interpretive definition of the Minoan Hall as a reception room and the court/reception room combination as is well known from the Near East and Egypt. Driessen notes: 'The Cretan achievement ... lies in the adaption and transformation of the Egyptian plan, where the rooms are separated, into a single architectural unit.'</page><page sequence="41">PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN Fig. 2.7. Plan of Rooms 4-5. Room 4 is one of the deeper semi-basement rooms in the w part of the Southeast Building. A foundation deposit (Context 4.1) at 10.30? was dug down into the bedrock, which itself yielded sparse EM IIB sherds, as elsewhere; the foundation deposit consisted of a large MM IIIA hemispherical cup (158). Above this deposit a floor with some small schist pavers was set at 10.45? with MM IIlA pottery resting on it (Context 4.2, fig. 2.9). Lying over this was a layer of wall collapse, indicated both by the quantities of decayed mud brick and the presence of small lots of much earlier (EM II-MM I) pottery, often found as part of the makeup of mud brick or pise construction (Context 4.3). Over this collapse layer is a floor at 10.76!. The floor had some LM IA pottery on it (Context 4.4) and may even have been constructed then; however, on balance it is more likely that the floor was laid in MM IIIB and simply stayed in use. A set of stone steps led to the stoa (Room 9a) from this floor (Context 4.6). These steps have subsided and were supported by a wooden frame; there is a gap for an upright post in the ne corner. This use of wood and the construction technique of Wall 661 with timber reinforcement links with the horizontal beam used in Room 8, as well as the polythyron in Room 3, and shows perhaps an increased use of wood in architecture at this time. A further collapse or accumulation of dumped material (Context 4.5) formed a rough uneven surface on which were found a double strainer vessel (693) and most of a cooking pot along with a deposit of Theran ash, indicating that the area was unroofed by the end of LM iA. The deposit with the ash is typical of our LM IA horizon; the presence of LM IA levels or intrusion is also typical of this eastern suite of rooms. context 4.1 (#6503-04) (fig. 2.8: 6) Excavation below the floor at 10.45T revealed a foundation deposit, consisting of a large hemispherical cup (161) that had been inserted into a much earlier stratum containing EM IIB sherds. The cup was found at 10.30?. Other foundation deposits of this kind, also datable to MM IIIA, are found elsewhere in the Building.29 29 MacGillivray et al. 1999, pi.

CONTEXT 5.1: PACKING AT 1 O. 2 8-1 0.68T, AND FOUNDATION DEPOSIT (#6520-21, 6523-25) (fig. 2.8: 9) The packing material includes fragments of ledge-rim bowls and other MM IIIA types. In this room, as in Room 4, we find a foundation deposit: a monochrome bridge-spouted jar (168), again consistent with a date in MM IIIA.30 Unlike in Room 4, the foundation deposit here was set amongst a packing of the same date rather than inserted into an earlier layer; probably suggesting a later deposition (though still within MM IIIA or early in MM IIIB) and associated with the construction of Wall 661. CONTEXT 5.2: PLASTER COLLAPSE (#6516-17, 6519, 3622, 3624, 3636) (FIG. 2.8: 8) The latest material seems MM IIIA (ledge-rims, base of dark slipped hemispherical cup with grooves), but there is some MM II also; the sloping plaster suggests somewhat articulated wall collapse, most likely necessitating the construction of Wall 661. CONTEXT 5.3: DEPOSIT WITH ASH ON SURFACE AT ll.09-ll.3iT (#6488, 6515, 6518; also 3608-21, 3623) (fig. 2.8: 7) This material ran over a portion of Wall 661 and continued down a little below and to the w of it. Theran ash was found in #3617 at 11.30?, in close association with numerous small finds (see catalogue in LM IA chapter). Analysis confirmed the ash to be Theran (see Appendix, sample PKV 9). Room 6a and 6b (figs. 2.9-2.11; plates 6-7) This seems to have been a blind basement room, in original conception at least. Early walls are 704 to the w, 725 and 713 to the N and 662 to the E; also 712 dividing the room roughly in half. Deposits of pottery (mostly cups) with sloping layers of silt and waterborne soil belong to this phase (MM IIIA, Context 6.1), but architecturally the space remains enigmatic. Wall 712 is built with larger roughly rounded stones at the bottom course, then a course of flatfish stones but above the lowest two courses the construction becomes small stone rubble; this could indicate a rebuild. This possible rebuild runs over Wall 713 to the n; however the two walls are bonded lower down and at the end of 712, just inside Room 7a, is a large mud brick recess which may have been used for a wooden frame. Thus it remains likely that these walls are simply the rubble foundation courses for a timber-framed wall. Wall 712 was not traced as far as the South Facade but presumably continued. It is tempting to look for a staircase (and/or an entrance system) in this corner of the building but the space is too wide at this early phase. The deposit on the floor/surface (at 10.53T) also seems to have fallen or been washed in and shows signs of burning, which argues against seeing these walls as sub-floor foundations, though how the room was accessed in MM IIIA remains unclear. Wall 712 may have been rebuilt in MM IIIB; but we find no new floor, rather a flood deposit with pebbles and pottery in a sloping layer and above this an intentional rubble fill (Contexts 6.2 and 6.3, FIG. 2.10). For this phase at least we might reconstruct a higher floor with wooden framework allowing the steps leading down into Room 7a to be accessed, as otherwise they lead nowhere; or a very wide staircase after all. A layer of collapsed or dumped debris of MM IIIB date lay across the top of Wall 704 and ran under the later Wall 526 beyond at the w. Above the debris was a late construction, Wall 706. This wall, running E-w just inside the S fagade with a return N projecting partway into the room, is in form suggestive of a staircase support. However, the construction, of raw boulders haphazardly piled and a large oblong boulder at the N end, perched atop two narrow stones and itself unsuitably rounded, do not seem to be structural. Most of the wall is just a single course of stones on earth and it might be some kind of installation or platform. However, it also looks suspiciously like stones dumped into a robbing pit, and despite the proximity to the LM IA deposit with the twin vase (Context 6.4), this late construction/pit fill must be LM III, pottery of which date was noted intrusively nearby in #7796, a context of otherwise LM IA debris at c. 11.20T. 30 Mentioned in MacGillivray et al. 1999, pi.

Room 7 a and 7B (figs. 2.11-2.12; plate 7) In general Room 7a shows fascinating, if fragmentary, evidence for the furnishings of the MM III building, with a fallen door jamb base of serpentinite and decorated wall plaster (Context 7(1.3). The architectural sequence is far from clear, however. Wall 571 to the E and 570 to the N seem the oldest, bonded and going down to bedrock. Wall 709 at the w abuts 570 so there may have been an early phase where 7a and 7b were united (Room 7b was a narrow corridor or closet closed off from 7a by Wall 709). Wall 713 to the s seems fairly well bonded with 709. This may simply be the order of construction. Stone steps lead down from the s at the E end of Wall 713. Just w of the steps below the stone tumble of Context ja.3 was a large mud brick niche and there was also a square pillar base just at the bottom of the steps (plate 7 b). Covering this, and spilling just onto the w part of the steps was a discrete area of stone tumble (Context 7a.5) not found throughout the rest of the room, probably due to clearance in LM IA (as suggested by the pottery in Context ja.4). In any case, the steps leading into and out of Room 7a, on which this debris fell, lead up to a non-existent floor level in Room 6. The steps no doubt continued in wood, but whether they went all the way up to a true second storey or merely to a higher floor level is unclear. In any case, this suggests that the walls in this part of the building may all have been sub-structure, though perhaps that fails to account for deposits in Room 6 — unless these had fallen through a higher perishable floor. Walls 570 and 571 were founded in nearly sterile soil at c. 10.07T. A floor was laid above this at c. 10.24-10.30!. This floor, which showed signs of burning, continued to the w under Wall 709 but was bounded to the N, e, and s by 570, 571 and 725, the latter an earlier phase of 713. This might imply a date of MM IIIB for the construction of Wall 709, one consistent with evidence from other rooms, notably Room 8, where a higher floor level was also constructed at this time, following a burnt destruction horizon. On the burnt MM IIIA floor in Room 7a was an accumulation (2-4 cm) of sand with a fine gravel (nerochoma) layer above; amidst these seemingly waterborne sediments was a substantial amount of MM IIIA pottery (Context ja.i)\ and above was a layer of softer, paler red earth, again with MM IIIA pottery (Context 712.2). Lying on and possibly in this layer, just to the w of the steps was an area of large stone tumble, including a cut serpentinite door jamb base (Context ya.5) (plate 7 e). Also fallen into the room was a large fragment (c. 40 x 20 cm, perhaps more) of painted, moulded plaster built up in layers, and lacking the impression of beams or stones — a wall moulding, or perhaps a piece of coving from above a beam at the top of the wall (plate 7 f). Other fresco fragments (and plaster generally) were found here, some with imitation stone veining (colour plate I f). This area of tumble was at first taken to be a wall or bench and dug separately after clearing the rest of the room. The tumble itself looks to be MM III (like the polythyron in Room 3), but the pottery within the tumble was scanty and undiagnostic, and the rest of the room had been cleared and</page><page sequence="46">BLOCK M ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY 1.

The steps themselves were shallow (15 cm) and formed from small stones. They seem to have cut into Wall 713. There was no clear floor level in Room 6 to which they could be linked (Context 6.5). They may have continued up (with Room 6 as a below-stair cupboard) or led to a somewhat higher floor that was not preserved. As elsewhere there were signs of some activity in LM IA, with a few whole cups atop the collapsed debris (Context ja.4). Either most of the room was cleared of tumble, leaving the area next to the stairs or, more likely, a wooden pillar was removed, eventually leading to the collapse of a discrete area of tumble (see Context 7a.5).</page><page sequence="47">22 PALAIKASTRO BLOCK Ml THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN CONTEXT 7A.I: BURNT FLOOR AT C. 10.24-10.30T WITH SAND AND GRAVEL ABOVE (#7847 48, 7856-57, 7862, 7865) (plate 7 b) MM IIIA pottery: ledge-rim bowls and eggshell Kamares cup 214.

This tumble, roughly 45 x 30 cm, was initially given a wall number and removed only after the room had been cleared down to a hard-packed surface level with the bottom tread of the stairs (Context 70.4, below). CONTEXT 7A.4: UPPER DISTURBED LEVELS (#7806-07, 78og) The room seems to have been at least partly cleared out, an operation dated by three catalogued conical cups of LM IA type (739-741), though most of the material is still early.

Room 8 (figs. 2.13-2.14; plate 8) Room 8 is located at the western end of the stoa (9a). In its original form, it was reached by a set of thickly (&gt;1 cm) plastered steps in the SE corner of the room, descending from s to N (plate 8 a). Wooden posts, possibly to support a handrail, but perhaps more likely to be structural elements, were set into plastered recesses, 10x8 cm and 5 cm deep along the E side of the steps. Bounded by early versions of Walls 589, 708, 716 and at the ne by an early version of 577 the room extended at the nw beyond the line of the later Wall 577. The overall room dimensions are 3.20 x 4.50 m. We assume some kind of additional structural element, a pillar or column but due to the later construction of Wall 710 no evidence for such was found. The very thick wall 570 at the S strongly suggests the presence at this side of the building of an upper storey, and the debris fallen into Room 7 supports this idea. The area had been cleared down to a kouskouras bedrock prior to construction and a thin (c. 10 cm) fill of clean earth spread throughout. A very fine paved flooring, of purple schist slabs in a fine lustrous plaster matrix, was then laid down at c. 10.24T, sloping gradually towards the N, with a sunken basin in the NW corner of the room, at 10.15T, which was fed by a shallow plaster channel at the se corner of the basin (Contexts 8.1 to 8.4) (plate 8 a-c). The basin, c. 6-18 cm deep, measured 2.6 m E-w and 1.5 m n-s, although it continued to the N into the baulk. Like the floor, it was well made with plastered sides in some cases rising slightly above the level of the surrounding floor. Early Wall 577 stops at the eastern edge of the sunken area. The basin and the floor are sealed and watertight, and the plaster from the slab floor extends up the walls of the room, with a border just above the floor of two bluish bands. This is the largest room and finest construction evident in the building. Though configured with some attention towards a regular exposure to liquid(s), the overall impression is one of luxury and even ostentation rather than utilitarianism. This mosaiko floor is strongly reminiscent of Knossos,31 as is the wall plaster with veined decoration in imitation of marble. The debris found on the slab floor, including the material in the sunken area may not necessarily relate to the use of the room but seems rather to have been introduced, whether fallen from above, 91 PMI, 321. Evans considered mosaiko paving to be typical of MM IIB.</page><page sequence="48">BLOCK M ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY Fig. 2.13. Plan of Room 8. deliberately dumped, or both (Contexts 8.1 to 8.4). Consequently only a rough date (MM IIIA) for this earliest floor can be extracted from its contents, and there is no clear evidence for its function.32 Several slabs were removed from the sunken basin and a substantial layer of re-deposited debris, including some burned mud brick and much worn sherd material, was introduced at the time the oblique Wall 710 was built. This wall lacks a proper face on the w and may have been constructed in part to hold back collapsed debris from Wall 708, which was also rebuilt at this time. It was only a single stone in width, generally triangular stones faced to the E. There was about 30 cm of disturbed debris/collapse left in the room, with much plaster and some signs of rebuilding. Low benches were built on the paved floor on Walls 577 at the E and 708 at the w along with Walls 710 and 716 at this time; these may have served to support a perishable floor at about this height, along with the horizontal beam evident in Wall 570 (plate 8 d). At least some of this debris was in situ MM IIIA collapse as shown by the corner of Walls 577 and 589 where the plaster, continuous from the paved floor, was preserved in situ up to a height of 25 cm and the rest of the plaster from the corner had fallen or been pulled down and was neatly nested inside the preserved lower section demonstrating that the lower 30 cm of this room was never fully cleared. Other material may have been introduced as a deliberate fill. The material from within the sunken basin itself had been mixed in with many stone chips of regular size yet there was no ceramic difference between this and the material sitting on the (slightly) higher portion of the floor, despite this difference in composition, and indeed there were numerous joins. Most likely at this time a doorway was cut in Wall 589 and paved with large sideropetra flagstones. A gradual accumulation of silt of varying depths filled in the space over time. These layers above the mosaiko floor were patchy, with pockets of debris of different types such as would suggest either pitting or a varied depositional process, but the unevenness of the lowest layer of debris suggests that 32 It is possible that Room 8 and/or Room 7 served some function/s of the lustral basins — though neither is canonical and both resemble other lustral basins only in the broadest sense; that they are sunken rooms, reached by stairs adjacent to an open court and with some suggestion of use involving liquids. Thus the enigmatic function(s) of Rooms 7-8 in this period may parallel the equally enigmatic function(s) of the 'canonical' lustral basins known from other sites.</page><page sequence="49">PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN NW Room 8 B5 I' SE B6 I ■•■*■• -'i I 1 ,?■■■ .'.ft*. •*-■ -•,■ ' ■ 1 f": . . &lt;-f, ° ' M rr* " ' I •' uV: .'-.J '- - -LJJ I", ''•x^ 0.mitf,'.,. 4p////7777&gt; 11.00" '.14 :.l 7 ':"'1 r v- »Vi"i r .-.-I I r 161 i in i nil I in 10.00 - unexcavated k1 7a I.

Wall 710 may not have had any upper courses and may have served instead to support a floor in perishable materials — hence the debris left piled in the corners.33 A horizontal beam slot or chase at the same height in Wall 571 (plate 8 d) supports such an interpretation as do the low benches against Wall 708 to the w and 589 at the e; Wall 716 could likewise have served as a support. A raised wooden floor would explain the lack of proper levelling of the earlier debris, as well as the accumulation of silt below the floor level and its eventual collapse into the room, giving a general impression of an upper storey collapse. Other evidence for rebuilding with wood comes from Room 4, where Wall 661 was framed out with timbers, from the stairs between Rooms 6 and 7, the polythyron in Room 3, and of course from the stoa itself. The occurrence of LM IA pottery along the walls of the room may also support the idea of a wooden floor in MM IIIB. Perhaps the wooden substructure of the floor had indeed survived, only to be robbed out at this later date (as much of the building seems to have been stripped at an advanced stage of LM IA), thereby introducing the later material particularly at the edges of the room. The remaining question is whether the higher floor was just some 20-30 cm above the construction surface (i.e. at the height of the substructure) or high enough (say 1.30 m) for a usable basement/crawl space.34 The only deposits suggestive of activities being carried out in the room are two cooking pots, both missing legs, set into hollowed-out debris (Contexts 8.5 and 8.6; plate 8 e) and covered by copious amounts of wall plaster, such as was found particularly around the edges of the room. The wall plaster was not articulated, as from collapse (except in the ne corner) but often vertical. One fragment from Context 8.6 with imitation stone veining is illustrated here (colour plate I f). In re-plastering, any loose or cracking plaster is first scraped off the wall and as this surface seems to have been used only by the builders (and was covered by a wooden floor at a higher level) it was simply left where it fell. One of the tripod pots itself was full of chunks of plaster, and both had several complete cups in association, though neither appears to have been used for cooking in this final deposition. They were 33 Popham (MUM: 53, 55) finds evidence for a raised wooden floor also set some 30 cm over the clay sub-floor in Room M of the Unexplored Mansion. 34 Standard ceiling height was only 1.70 m.</page><page sequence="50">BLOCK M ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY 25 on opposite sides of Wall 716 at the same absolute height. Both were in layers that contained predominantly MM III pottery (much looking IIIA rather than IIIB) but the pot on the N side of 716 also had several fragments of LM IA pottery, notably a bridge-spouted jar with petaloid loops (plate 8 /), the rest of which came from the far side of the room, along Wall 577. In any case, despite the presence of a few LM IA sherds in association with the deposit N of 716 (Context 8.5), and the early date of Context 8.10 (generally MM IIIA rather than IIIB) we still consider that both cooking pot deposits actually belong to the same rebuilding phase within MM III and that they were most probably used by the individuals involved in the reconstruction activities. There followed a gradual accumulation of silt over the uneven surface formed by the disturbed destruction material and builders' debris (the cooking pots). During this time elsewhere in the building (Room 6) there is a flood event, followed by an earthquake some time later. Here in Room 8 it is as if this room was somehow shielded from the full effects of these events — again, something that would fit well with a wooden floor, acting like a screen. Also, if the central portion of the floor had given way, then the sub-floor debris layer might well slope down towards the edges of the room and intrusive material would slide down as well. The next event discernible in the history of the room is the collapse or removal of this raised floor, some part of which may not have happened until LM IA during the final looting phase preceding the eruption of Thera. Following some final collapse or robbing activity, the sloping surface of the rubble at c. 11.00T was used for some minor cooking activity at an advanced (but pre-Theran eruption) stage of LM IA (Context 8.15). A few conical cups and coarse ware fragments found lying on the surface testify to this 'squatter'35 occupation, a phase also noted above in Rooms lb, 4, 6 and 7. Note: out of caution and because of the extremely patchy and variable nature of the deposits in this room we have kept separate contexts that may well belong together. CONTEXT 8.1: SUNKEN AREA IN PAVED FLOOR AT C. 10.15? (#8086-87, 8093, 8lOO, 8107-11, 8113, 8116, 8131) (fig. 2.14: 17a) This context is formed by the debris found in the sunken paved area, and ran under Wall 710. The sherd material was mixed with a fairly uniform chipped stone gravel, which distinguished it from the rest of the debris on the paved floor (Contexts 8.2-4). However, the ceramics were indistinguishable and there are joins to Context 8.4 (between #8107-08 and 8104), so all of these contexts should really be seen as part of the same operation, levelling MM IIIA debris and constructing Walls 710 and 716, and the benches along 589 and 708.

These joining fragments of later material all from around the edges of the room next to walls could well be linked to the robbing out of the wooden floor in LM IA. As mentioned above, since these were originally separated during excavation and preliminary study, we have kept the contexts separate for this publication, but Contexts 8.5, 8.6, and 8.10 should probably all be considered as one.

This type is very diagnostic of MM IIIB. Like Context 8.5 and 8.10, this records construction activity (including re-plastering) the detritus of which we think was left under the higher floor level. MIXED MIDDLE LEVELS AT C. IO.40-10.80! Context 5.7 (#8053-55 and 8062-63) Context 8.8 (#8047, 8066, 8072 and 8083-84) (fig. 2.14: 14) Context 8.9 (#8046, 8049 and 8065) Context 8.11 (#8050-51, 8057) (fig. 2.14: 11) These contexts are lower than the preserved top course of Wall 710, and so separated by it. As we suspect that 710 is merely a sub-floor support, these contexts could actually be linked into one general level. Generally heterogeneous with much MM IIIA jumbled up with MM IIIB (see adjacent 8.5-8.6) and some intrusive LM IA. The MM IIIA material often included significant traces of burning and as noted above seems not to have ever been fully cleared away. Context 8.10 is not part of this grouping and belongs rather with Contexts 8.5 and 8.6. Some of this material may well belong with those contexts particularly Context 8.y which has joins to 8.6. There was probably a gradual and patchy accumulation here of silt below the floor level, the removal of which then introduced later material. CONTEXT 8.10: TRIPOD COOKING POT AT C. IO.35T S OF WALL 716 (#8058, 8077, 8088) (fig. 2.14: 13) This context corresponds stratigraphically to Contexts 8.5 and 8.6: all belong to reconstruction activities in MM IIIB. This context lies on the other (s) side of Wall 716 and just like Context 8.5 consists of a complete (though legless) tripod cooking pot set into the rough surface with, in this case, some cups around it. Wall 716 was probably also only a sub-floor partition/support for a higher MM IIIB floor and these deposits may relate to builders' activities. Here, the pottery is mostly MM IIIA in date (save one possibly later ledge-rim bowl), demonstrating again the lack of thorough cleaning after the MM IIIA destruction. Some of this material comes from the rubble beneath the slabs in the doorway of Wall 589 which must belong to the MM IIIB rebuild. CONTEXT 8.12: LAYER OF DEBRIS/collapse AT C. 10.75-10.90T (#8038, 8040-43, 8045) (fig. 2.14: 10) This may relate to Context 8.9 beneath it: most of it, as 8.9, is MM IIIB. CONTEXT 8.13: UPPER DEBRIS LAYER AT IO.9O-I I.00T (#8017-21, 8023-24, 8033, 8036-37, 8039) (fig. 2.14: 10). Below the latest occupation surface, at c. 11.20T were varied layers of tumbled stony debris mixed in with fallen paving stones and plaster. There were no discernible floors or occupation horizons and the</page><page sequence="52">BLOCK M ARCHITECTURE AND stratigraphy 27 pottery was quite mixed, with substantial amounts of MM II-IIIA, a predominance of MM IIIB, and some LM IA (generally conical cups). Also present are some well-preserved joining fragments of a baking plate (755): this is often a feature of LM IA deposits across Block M (though baking plates themselves are hard to date typologically and, as they are often dug into floors, by nature intrusive). CONTEXT 8.14: UPPER DEBRIS LAYER, ll.OO-ll.i5T (#8013-16, 8025, 8034-35, 8048) (fig. 2.14: 10) As Context 8.13, with more LM IA material. More joining baking plate fragments and large cooking pot ware fragments, as in Context 8.13, and also a fine small bridge-spouted jar, 757, with glossy dark on-light decoration of 'petaloid loops'.36 CONTEXT 8.15: UPPERMOST SURFACES AT C. Il.l8-ll.20t (#0730-36, 0738-42, 0747, 0749A, 0752-53, 8011-12, 5643, 5646, 5648) (fig. 2.14: 9) Following some final collapse or robbing activity the sloping surface of rubble was reused for some minor cooking activity at an advanced (but pre-Theran eruption) phase of LM IA. A few conical cups and coarse ware fragments found lying on the surface testify to this 'squatter' occupation. Often in these upper levels the most diagnostic pottery consists of conical cups; otherwise cooking pot ware and baking plates dominate and fine wares are very rare. Also here a small fragment from a fresco 10762 with yellow and red curvilinear motifs suggestive of a human or perhaps animal figure (see 10753 colour PLATE I d) that joined with fragments from Context 15.2. Pumice from this context was analysed and confirmed as Theran, from the BO eruption (see Appendix, samples PKV 10/1 and 10/2). CONTEXT 8.16: TUMBLE BELOW SUBSOIL (#4393-409) This context consists of upper levels at or over the preserved tops of walls; it is mixed post-occupation debris of LM IA date. CONTEXT 8.17: TEST BELOW STEPS TO COURT (#8089-90, 8117) This is a small test beneath the slabs which form steps up to the court. These were not part of the original MM IIIA room as they were built over the earlier mud brick and plaster stairs, but were added at the same time as Wall 710 which divided Room 8. A globular jug from beneath the slabs could be a foundation deposit for this rebuilding.37 CONTEXT 8.18: MM IIIB FILL BETWEEN WALLS 526 AND 704 (#8028) This is a substantial deposit from just outside the West Facade 704, and was bounded to the w by the later Wall 526. This mass (four tables)38 of broken up but frequently joining pottery is typical of the MM IIIB earthquake horizon in the building and must represent material fallen or subsequently cleared out of the building. Note that this finds connection with Contexts 6.3 (#7790-92) and 79.3 (#0696, 0726-27, 0842-44, 0882, 0901-05). Room 9 a and 9B (figs. 2.15-2.17; plates g-10) Room 9 forms the central court of the building: 9a is the open court and the stoa that may have continued all the way around it; 9b is the platform of large slabs at the E of the court. Room 9a measures 7.4 by 10.4 m, including the stoa and open area of the court but excluding 9b. Bounded to the w by Walls 589 and 571 and at least in part to the N by 577, the room connects at the E to the platform 9b, and the drain in Room 12 a; and at the s to Rooms 1-4 (Room 3 via a polythyrori). The earliest signs of activity in Room 9a are Prepalatial, and come from Context ga.i, in the sw corner of the room. Here was a fill of EM II-MM IA sherds over which was laid an orange-red plaster floor at 10.60T, which was bounded (or cut) by Walls 717 and 718 (fig. 2.17; plate 9 a). These walls were built up against Walls 654 at the s and 571 at the W, and preserved only two courses high, the tops of which were at c. 11.08T. They may have been built as bolsters for 654 and 571 and may cut the plaster floor; this was not clear. Also at this height to the w were two paving slabs with red 36 Betancourt 1983, 29-30; see also PKU, pi. 16b. 37 Cat. 6036, a globular pear-shaped jug, H pres 13.8, D base 7; described in MacGillivray et al. 1999 (see pi. CI a) as built into the fabric of a cross-wall. 38 See n. 16 above.</page><page sequence="53">PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN Fig. 2.15. Plan of Room 9.</page><page sequence="54">BLOCK M ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY 29 plastered interstices separated from the orange plaster floor by a narrow partition that cornered in the N with yet another plaster floor beyond (also reddish). The plaster and paved-and-plaster floor fragments do not go with any of the nearby architecture — they are internal (unlike the later stoa), and possibly cut by Walls 571 and 654. They also betray a high status building, as the floor plaster is very fine. The MM IIA packing above this level may suggest a date for the red plaster floor in MM IB, as would the MM IA pottery in Context ga.i. Following this we see a horizon of activity in MM IIA, represented by fills identified in the sw, nw and ne zones of the room (Contexts ga.2, cja.4 and ga.y respectively). At the top of this thick layer of dense sherd and stone fill a medium crushed stone gravel was used as bedding for large sideropetra slab paving. The paving was punctuated with column bases of which two survived intact (plate g b). Made of well-dressed blue-grey limestone, these measure 68 and 46 cm in diameter respectively and are both exceptionally well cut and formed, and deliberately roughened in the middle to seat a wooden column (plate 9 c). Up to 6 cm of plaster stood in situ on the smaller, w column base for 25 cm of its circumference, preserving the outline of the column (plate 9 d). This large slab paving was especially well preserved along the s of the court; elsewhere it had been robbed and only the outline of the coarse gravel bedding was found. Smaller slabs may have been used beyond the polythyron and Room 3; perhaps when the robbers hit the very large slabs they stopped as they were too unwieldy. One large slab set between the two columns was partially robbed; it had broken and of the two large fragments removed, one sat atop the E part of the same slab and the other rode atop c. 30 cm of rubble and soil that filled in and overlay the pit created when the slab was robbed (plate 10 a-b). From this we can deduce that this robbing took place after the slabs were covered over with at least 0.75-1.00 m of soil, and that the floating slab was left on the side of the robbing trench and as the robbing trench walls eroded into the pit it eventually slipped to the position it was in when excavated. This robbing we attribute to LM III, along with the LM III pits in Rooms 3 and 6. The central part of the court was coated with a hard plaster matrix that incorporated the top layer of the large stone gravel, with a layer of somewhat finer plaster over this. Evidence for re-layings of this plaster floor was ambiguous and may only be the result of normal upkeep; however, over the plaster floor was a pebbly layer with up to 10 cm of silt accumulated on it and some conical cups — typical of the wash layers found in seemingly open areas of the building. This pebbly layer ran over much of the architecture including the slabs and, it seems, parts of Wall 577 to the N. No Theran ash was found in the court suggesting that this post-occupation pebbly surface was in place at the time of the eruption and the ash was swept cleanly away.39 The contexts with LM IA material over the slabs are 9a. 3, 90.5 and ga.6. Room gb was accessed by a low step (approximately 8 cm difference in height) from Room ga. It consisted of four large, thin slabs of a whitish, fairly soft limestone, each set in a plastered wooden frame, traces of which were found to the E, N and s where the rectangular red plaster (c. 25 cm wide) had subsided after the deterioration of the wooden beams (plate 10 d). Perhaps in recognition of their fragility, the slabs were set into 1 o cm of a very fine and pure gravel of such uniform particle size it must have been sifted. This bedding soil was laid directly over the standard MM IIA fill. The slabs (from nw to sw clockwise) measured 1.55 m E-w x 1.80 m N-s; 1.65 m e-w x 1.80 m N-s; 1.63 m E-w x 1.83 m n-s; and i.6g m E-w x 2.42 m N-s. An additional slab may have extended the s of the SE slab to match the sw. The slabs were 10 to 12 cm thick. This construction, both in material and in design, is similar to that in Palaikastro Block X 64 and especially 66.40 A sandstone (ammouda) pivot-stone, likewise subsided from its wooden frame, indicates a doorway opening into Room 11 b at the NE corner of the platform. A square pillar base of the same soft white limestone as the slabs sat just E of the SE slab. Whether there was any communication with Room 10b remains unclear; as the contents of that room suggest that it was out of use already by the end of MM II, if not before, this is doubtful; however one might imagine a fugitive floor level connecting only with the drain (e.g. a toilet) that could have remained in use. The platform was laid after the slabs and columns of the stoa were already in place. This indicates some phasing, although it may simply reflect the order of construction within a single building episode — perhaps as a matter of procedure the platform slabs were pre-cut to fit the column base and walls plastered before slabs laid. In any case, beyond noting the phasing there is no direct dating evidence for most of the construction, other than to say it is sandwiched between MM IIA on the one hand 39 We tend to find the ash collected in depressions, pits, rivulets, pockets, against walls, inside pots — places that could trap it and prevent it being washed or blown away. 40 PKIV, 278, fig. 9.</page><page sequence="55">PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN Room 9a SW B9 B8 BIO 2.

CONTEXT gA.i: TEST BELOW ORANGE PLASTER FLOOR (#6539-40) (FIG. 2.l6: 22) This is in the sw corner of the room, and seems to represent the earliest material in the area of Room ga. A test below the orange plaster floor went down to 10.26T, with very few sherds, among which some that could be Prepalatial, ranging from EM IIB to possible MM IA. Overlying these early levels is the orange plaster floor and over that the MM IIA fill, suggesting that the plaster floor is MM IB.</page><page sequence="56">BLOCK M architecture AND stratigraphy 31 CONTEXT 9A.2: MM II FILL IN STOA TRIAL (#6526-30, 6532-35) (FIG. 2.l6: 19, 20) Immediately above the orange-red plaster floor is a layer that includes worn MM IIA pottery with few joins, suggestive of a fill. The material is comparable in date to the fills from beneath Rooms 1,10 and 11, though it is much more worn. Above this fill are laid the paving slabs of the stoa that remain in use through to the end. CONTEXT 9A.3: LM IA FROM SW CORNER (#4412-19) (FIG. 2.16: 18) This material from above the paving slabs included a typical LM IA conical cup (uncatalogued), as well as the base of a pithos (D base c. 35 cm) sitting approx. 3 cm above the slabs themselves. The pithos base, in a coarse red phyllite fabric and wheelmade, is very worn. CONTEXT 9A.4: NW CORNER BELOW SLABS (#0754-57) In the nw corner of Room 9a the lowest excavated levels reveal more of the MM II fill as in Context ya.2. Just below the gravel bedding for the slabs the pottery is already MM II. This suggests that, as also in the sw corner of the stoa, the paving was laid down after MM IIA, and probably in MM IIB. CONTEXT 9A.5: NW CORNER (#0748-53) Here we see scattered schist slabs, perhaps fallen, associated with MM IIIB and LM IA pottery. There is quite a lot of cooking pot ware, and a large fragment of a ceramic 'beehive'. Possibly this is debris that has washed in. CONTEXT 9A.6: NORTH-central AREA (#3562-67) This is an accumulation above a pebble surface (see Context 9.4, above) — probably washed-in LM IA material. CONTEXT 9A.7: NE CORNER (#2780, 2816) This is from the ne corner of Room ga next to Wall 607 outside Room 12. Some small paving stones had been placed here, possibly to stabilise a low corner prone to flooding. Pottery is assignable to MM I—II. These paving stones were at a fairly low absolute height and their relationship to the paved stoa and court is unclear as they may be earlier, or perhaps more likely indicate a slope in the court surface (as they were near the location of the drain in Room 12). CONTEXT 9A.8: TUMBLE ABOVE STOA (#2948-49, 2951, 2955-57) Material fallen onto the stoa, stone tumble, plaster, and small stone plaques as might have been used for paving. CONTEXT 9A.9: ROBBING TRENCH FOR SLAB (#2916, 2953-54) This context dates the robbing trench for a slab in the stoa, half the slab found atop its original location with rubble intervening. #2954 isolates this robbing activity — the scanty material seems most consistent with LM III but is generally undiagnostic. CONTEXT 9B.1: BELOW the SLABS (#2867-73, 4377"78) This is material from below the slabs, apparently more of the MM IIA fill found all across the building. CONTEXT 9B.2: ON the SLABS (#2833, 2863-65, 2780) This context incorporates all of the upper zembils across the slabs. Most revealed LM IA material and some volcanic ash, confirmed as Theran by the analysis of Bichler etal. (sample PKV 1, see Appendix). Room 11b, just E of the slabs, seems to have been used in LM IA (see below). Room ioa and iob (figs. 2.18-2.19; plates 3 a and 11a) Room 10a is a small closet communicating with Room 11.

Section F: n section through Room 10 showing MM II drain. MM IIB carinated bridge-spouted jug,41 and stayed in use into MM IIIB, when it was an active storage closet full of pottery (some 447 catalogued items), sealed in situ by an earthquake at the end of the period.42 We will not repeat what has already been published but, to summarise briefly, the contents were carefully arranged according to broad categories: large to medium tripod vessels; pouring vessels; large handled cups; and small handleless cups. Each of these four categories was stored and even stacked together, despite differences in sub-category (e.g. the large handled cups included straight sided and rounded cups, the handleless included conical cups and ledge-rim bowls). The smaller vessels were stored higher up; the handled cups especially on a plaster shelf. This plaster shelf was painted with a thin blue line around the edge and did not show any clear imprint of supporting material on the back. During the earthquake, the stone jamb fell into the room and the lintel collapsed into the doorway, intermingled with the tumbled debris. There were frequent spaces between vessels and the deposit was clearly pristine. 41 See MacGillivray el al. 1999. 42 See PK ND for full publication of this deposit; it was called Room 'Ri' at the time.</page><page sequence="58">BLOCK M ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY 33 Room 10b is a blind space formed by Walls 535 to the s, 530 to the E 663 to the n and 542 to the w. No floor levels were found here and this must certainly have been sub-floor space. The fill in the room was MM II(A?) right down into the finely built drain (plate 2 a). The drain is 48 cm wide, with sides preserved 36 cm deep and both the same height (unlike the drain in Room 12a). The drain was traced for almost two metres; the pitch seems to be about 1 cm down for each 22 forward but it is hard to be sure with such a small portion exposed. This drain runs at a very different alignment from the rest of the MM IIB-IIIA construction; it possibly aligns with various early walls in Room 18, 64, 49 and 50 and early walls noticed in Room 13, though the correspondence is not exact and large distances separate these early walls. The drain is finely constructed, paved with schist slabs and runs under Room 11a (where a test revealed the side wall of the drain) and out of the building where it intersects with the drain in Room 12 a, as both empty into a closed drain system along the w side of Street B-M. If the drain were a conduit for water from the roof, or even part of a toilet/sewage system, it is possible that it was sealed (and below floor level) so that no later material fell in. Still, considering the alignment, it is perhaps most likely that it belongs to an earlier building in MM IB IIA. The fill in Room 11a that covered the drain was of course also MM IIA. CONTEXT lOA.i: MM IIA FILL BENEATH FLOOR (#4579, 4581) This fill is the same as that found across much of this side of the building; a representative sample is already published.43 Note also the foundation deposit consisting of a MM IIB jug, with very good parallels from Malia Quartier Mu,44 and already mentioned in an article on Palaikastro foundation deposits.45 CONTEXT 10A.2: POT DEPOSIT (4560, 4567-70) (PLATE 11 a) This is a substantial MM IIIB destruction deposit in a 'closet', with MM II fill beneath. It is already published.46 Note that the destruction deposit continues into Room 11a (see below). CONTEXT 10A.3: UPPER LEVELS (#4369, 4372, 4561-64, 4566) Including possible LM IB field surface at c. 11.70T. CONTEXT lOB.i: MATERIAL INSIDE DRAIN (#4383-85) (FIG. 2.19: 5) The lowest level consists of the bottom of the drain and has very little diagnostic material. CONTEXT IOB.2: P ROTO PALATIAL DEPOSIT ABOVE DRAIN (4375-76, 4380-82) (FIG. 2.19: 4) These levels show the walls, 535, 530 and 542, that are associated with the drain. The pottery in these levels is MM II. There are large quantities and some diagnostic pieces. Plaster attached to Wall 535 higher up suggests an interior space. MM IIA pottery continues to be present. CONTEXT 10B.3: UPPER LEVELS (#4370, 4373~74)47 (FIG. 2.X9: 3) There is little evidence in this room for Neopalatial activity, in stark contrast to the neighbouring Rooms 10a and 11a, with their substantial MM IIIB destruction deposits. While in the higher levels (e.g. #4371, 4373) we encounter a little MM IIIB or LM IA pottery, it is the Protopalatial period that is particularly well represented in this room. Room iia and hb (fig. 2.20; plate 11 b) Room 11a is bounded by Wall 663 to the s and 719 to the e; also Wall 811 to the N. A doorway in 811 communicates with Room 12; whether there was any communication between 11a and 11b is unclear; they were, in any case, divided by a narrow partition wall. Wall 663 was founded on bedrock, amidst a nearly sterile soil, very red, with some sparse EM IIB material at around 10.30-10.40!. As elsewhere, Room 11a was filled in with MM IIA material (Context na.i); in this case the fill was put in after the drain in Room 10b was built, since a test showed that 43 In PK ND. 44 See Mu IV. 45 MacGillivray et al. 1999. 46 In PK ND. 47 PK 1991, pi. 4c.</page><page sequence="59">PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN Fig. 2.20. Plan of Room 11. this fill covered the SE wall of the drain. As in Room 1 oa, the deposit on the floor that sealed the fill was an MM IIIB destruction deposit (Context na.2). This deposit on a floor at c. 10.got was similar to Context ioa.2 but without the intermingled architectural collapse and with certain other differences. Although no indisputably later ceramic material was recovered, there was no doubt that the deposit had been disturbed and the comparison with the deposit in Room xoa is worth making — the composition of the deposits was essentially identical in types, forms and date of the ceramic material and the initial depositional agent (earthquake), but the condition of the deposits completely different. Where in 10a the pots were still fallen in groups, piled high with frequent large gaps and spaces between them, all complete with very little extra sherd material, in Room 11 a the vases were jumbled and crushed, especially the uppermost layers. There were areas that seemed as if there might be two layers of deposit; but it was ambiguous and could not be satisfactorily traced. Still, a sequential upper storey collapse cannot be ruled out. Also larger vessels tended to be in fragments. There were a number of baking plates and some charcoal, generally absent from Room 10a, and while the architectural collapse in Room 10a had effectively sealed that deposit, it seems that Room 11 had remained accessible and consequently the deposit had been rifled. The E wall 719 had partly collapsed and subsequently been almost totally removed during the construction of the LM IB enceinte wall 707. Also, Wall 811 had likewise subsided over the edge of the deposit (plate 11 b) and may have been rebuilt in LM IA.48 These operations, and the continued use of Room 11b (for which see below), are likely responsible for the disturbed condition of the Room 11a deposit. Another interesting feature of the material from Context 11 a. 2 was the presence of partly or totally unfired cups, usually stacked together with properly fired ones (in some cases a partly fired ledge-rim bowl would be stacked with conical cups). These were not water-fast but had held their shape; it is hard to imagine that a totally unfired vessel would be preserved at all and experiments showed that very low-fired vessels were water soluble. Also, cups were not simply fired or unfired, rather a range of firing was evident. Much of the un- or low-fired material was unrecoverable; certainly 1/4 to 1/3 of the deposit was in this condition. Room 11b communicated with the slab platform (Room gb) via a doorway for which the sandstone (ammouda) pivot stone was preserved, though slipped from its original position — similarly, sloping plaster indicated the decayed wooden doorframe. Although a narrow partition wall may have separated this space from 11 a, it is unclear if the two were really non-communicating. This small anteroom had a floor at c. 11.30? that contained only a few vessels, all of LM IA date; so the room continued in use or was at least accessible until then. Excavation stopped at this level so no earlier evidence was found. 48 The alternative is that flooding had undercut the wall and swept the debris in.</page><page sequence="60">BLOCK M ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY 35 CONTEXT 1 1 A. 1 This is identical to the fill material from Rooms 10a, 12b, lb, gb, etc.; what was interesting about this fill was that it covered the sidewall of the drain in Room 1 ob, giving that drain a terminus ante quem of MM IIA late/MM IIB early. CONTEXT 1 1 A.2 This is virtually identical in ceramic terms to the deposits from Rooms 10a and 45 published in 2003.49 Indeed a portion of this deposit had been excavated in 1996 and was included in that publication. There were masses of conical and straight sided cups, ledge rim bowls, etc. The differences here are due largely to post-depositional factors; save the odd firing (plate 19 d-e). CONTEXT 11B.1 (#2858-61, 2866) In a small space separated from Room 11 a by a partition wall and accessed from a doorway cut into Wall 811 and possibly from the large limestone slabs of Room 9b via a small doorway, this room seems to have been a small closet. Here was a rare deposit of LM IA material, several cups and a jug, amid some collapsed mud brick, with some signs of burning. Room 12A and 12B (figs. 2.21-2.22; plates 11-12) As in Street B-M, Room lb, Room 4, and Room 11a, the first indications of human activity in Room 12 are very sparse and worn sherds of EM II date, with occasional flecks of charcoal in a matrix of hard dark red soil with occasional small pebbles. Frequently mistaken for sterile soil or bedrock (vrakhos) by even the professional workmen, these levels show no sign of any structure in this spot at this time, in contrast with deposits from nearby Building 7. On the other hand they may indicate a levelling process rather than the edge of the settlement proper. Here in Room 12 the top of this early layer was reached, at 10.60T, at the w between Walls 611 and 614, and at the e along the lower part of Wall 607. These walls continued down, although probably not far, and they can most likely be associated with the introduction of a deep and compact fill of MM IIA ceramics. The next horizon is the intensive building programme that probably saw a levelling of the area (perhaps removing any traces of EM III-MM IIA structures), with wall foundations then set down on or near bedrock, and a deep compact fill of small stones, charcoal and massive quantities of broken up pottery introduced throughout the se and central portions of the building (here Context i2b.i). The floors that were laid down over the fill in this part of the building were of a thick fine white plaster (as testified in Rooms 12 and la) laid over and incorporating a layer of partly crushed murex shells (c. 2 cm thick). This may go together with the construction of the substantial drain in this room, which stays in use into MM IIIA, before being furnished with a terracotta channel in MM IIIB. Drawing on indirect evidence from nearby rooms (such as 10 and 11), it is likely that these rooms fall out of normal use with the MM IIIB seismic destruction, though they do see some LM IA activity, principally in the digging of pits, perhaps to salvage architectural pieces (such as some of the schist drain slabs). There is also some indication of minor LM IA remodelling, connected with Wall 811 and Room 1 lb (see above). The robbing pits (though note one of the pits is apparently used for cooking), are filled up with a mix of MM II and LM IA pottery and indeed in one striking instance with much tephra (more than 500 kg) from the Theran eruption, indicating that the building was already out of use and unroofed by the end of LM IA. We do not know what kind of surface there originally was in Room 12a over the drains, or if this was somehow external, but it is interesting to note that the large tephra pit was roughly the size of one of the large white limestone slabs from the platform in Room 9b, topped out at roughly the same height, and the MM II fill into which the pit was dug was also the same. The fine gravel bedding was missing but there were many pockets of nerochoma or waterborne soil that could well have been admixtures of it. Room 12a is a narrow rectangular space bounded by Walls 811 to the s and 607 to the N. 607 is an early wall with some signs of rebuilding; the earlier part (Wall 614) was reached in Room 12b. Here to the S the wall is well-built with rounded medium boulders and two good faces; however it appears to be built on a slant; that is to say the absolute level drops by c. 30 cm from w to E and the stones 49 In PK ND they are labelled as Room R1/R3 and EP 87, respectively.</page><page sequence="61">PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN Fig. 2.21. Plan of Room 12. themselves slope — it does not seem to be a stepped or robbed-out construction, though it is impossible to be sure. Perhaps it could have been part of a ramp leading up to the court. If so, no other traces remained. At the s of the room Wall 811 continues from the E, but not exactly in line and the construction techniques are markedly different — the w portion separating Rooms 9b and 12a is a typical MM III small stone rubble wall with red plaster preserved at its base, while the E part, between Rooms 1 la and 12a is built with two solid faces of roughly triangular stones and no plaster preserved — perhaps a sign of the possible LM IA rebuild mentioned above. The principal feature in Room 12a is a long, well-built, slab-lined drain (plate 3 b-c). The drain is paved with flat schist slabs approximately 55-60 cm wide (the width of the drain) and 22-60 cm long; the side walls were constructed after the paving and were not even, the N wall being 15 cm lower than the s. Cover slabs were likewise set at an angle; these were robbed out of the w portion of the drain, collapsed to the E and in situ for a short stretch at the far E of the drain. The drawn section (fig. 2.22) shows clearly the location of the cover slabs, as the underlying deposit was not disturbed at that point. The drain runs for 7 m from the court to where it joins the street drain system; there it meets the drain coming out of Room 1 ob, and both empty out into a closed drain which runs along the w side of Street B-M. The drain drops steeply, descending 1 cm for each 12 cm forward, more than double the necessary pitch.50 With any appreciable amount of liquid flow this could certainly cause problems; but we do not know exactly how the drain functioned. It is not now located at the lowest point in the court. It may be that the steep pitch was an attempt to counter the tendency of drains to silt in during what must have been a very wet period in the site's history, judging by the silt accumulations throughout the building.51 The pottery found inside the drain is assignable to MM IIB and MM IIIA, suggesting that the drain was certainly in use in the latter of these periods, and perhaps already in MM IIB (note too that the drain seems to connect to what may have been an earlier MM IB-IIA system, judging by the evidence of the drain from Room 10b). Contexts iia.i, 12a.2 and 12(1.4 show the MM IIB to IIIA date quite clearly, while Context 12(1.5 contains this early material too, though contaminated by LM IA pottery, perhaps introduced when the cover slabs here were removed. We had anticipated an entrance in this area52 and cannot rule one out; but the only evidence is the presence of a closet of pottery devoted to drinking and pouring vessels (Room 10a) and while 50 Modern plumbing uses a 1/48 pitch e.g. 1 cm drop for each 48 cm of length; while there is a great deal of variation in pitch in Minoan drain systems (and much uncertainty as to exact function in many cases) simply comparing to the nearby drain in Room 10b which has a pitch of 1/22 shows how extreme the pitch of this drain is. 51 On Bronze Age climate change, see Moody 2000. 52 PK 1994/6, 249.</page><page sequence="62">BLOCK M ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY 37 similar concentrations of cups are often found next to entrances,53 this makes for a dangerously tautological interpretation. From the street (see Street B-M below) there was an area where perhaps an opening in the E fa9ade had been filled in but the construction of Wall 707 in LM IB had effectively obscured it. If there was an entrance here it must have been at a height well above the drain, using either steps or a ramp of sorts. At some point in MM III, probably after some of the flooding events recorded in Room 6, the drain silted in and was remodelled. Possibly the schist slab at the w end where the drain meets the court was added at this time; more significantly, a terracotta drain channel was added at the E, where the drain meets the street (Context 12a.3; plate 11 c-d). The terracotta drain channel was 1 m long with walls 6 cm high. The w end was open (no side wall) and about 20 cm across, roughly oval, narrowing to a channel 4-6 cm wide, which ended where the drain joined the Street B-M drain. It was carefully propped up and secured with stones and sherds and just below it was set an inverted ledge-rim bowl of MM IIIA type (SF 68; uncatalogued), a foundation deposit of sorts. The terracotta drain channel is very similar to drains found in Block Pi in 1904; while a date of LM III is suggested for one of these drains the other is 'bedded on Middle Minoan walls and below a thick deposit of Late Minoan I pottery'.54 And although the channel was propped up by stones, these were set in a soil matrix, suggesting that the drain had silted in despite the pitch. An alternative interpretation would be that the extreme pitch had caused difficulties at the intersection with the B-M street drain and this was an attempt to moderate the flow and control sidewall erosion. There is no sign of the drain being used later than MM IIIB; at some point the cover slabs were removed and the w portion of the drain emptied; but to the E only the slabs were removed, and even these were spared at the far e. This robbing was carried out in LM IA (see Contexts 12(1.5, I2a-i)\ and there may have been a surface of sorts next to Wall 811 (Context 12a.6; see also Context 12b.5 for the possibility of steps leading up to this surface). Afterwards the thick tephra fall extended partly over the drain. Surfaces at c. 11.40 and 11.70! may relate to the LM IB use (or lack of use) of the area. To the N of 12a, Room 12b is another narrow rectangular space of similar proportions, bounded by Walls 607 and 614 to the S and 611 to the n. There was a partition wall 835 to the E preserved only for a single course, and not more than 45 cm in width, founded on a hard surface (the result of levelling rather than a floor) at c. 10.60-10.70T (Context 12b.1). A plaster bench associated with Wall 614 is represented by Context 12b.3, with MM IB-IIA pottery. They are perhaps in use for only a very short time before the introduction of a deep and compact fill of MM IIA pottery and stone, of the kind found throughout the E side of the Southeast Building. This fill is represented primarily by Contexts 12b.2 and 12b.4. After the introduction of the dense MM IIA packing fill, a fine white plaster floor was laid, and a curb or bench 608 was built against Wall 611. At least two sandstone plaques were set along the plastered channel formed by Wall 608, and probably a third as well (Context 12b.8 is the soil beneath these plaques). These were at 11.25T, about the same height as the low curb 608. The plaster floor sloped down sharply as it approached the N and 608 then turning upwards at an acute angle and running up the face of 608. Further to the E a line of stones had been placed just inside the angled plaster so that the plaster ran under and up behind the stones (Context 12 b. 6). The sandstone plaques could have been bases for pithoi but were unmarked (nor were any pithoi found). Between the plaques and the bench/wall 608, and filling the plaster channel was 6 cm of absolutely pure greenish clay (domatochoma) — whether this was filling or forming a channel was impossible to tell. No sherds, stones, bones or anything else was in this layer of domatochoma. With the evidence for flowing or draining liquids, the plaster, the plaques, the odd little bench of 608 we imagine some kind of storage or industrial purpose for this space but remain at a loss as to what. In LM IA several pits were dug in this room (Contexts 12b.g-12b.13). At least one served to explore the drain in 12a (Context 12b. 11, see also 12b.5). Another pit, found full of baking plate fragments (Context 12b.9), may have been associated with LM IA squatters' cooking activities. Another large, roughly square, shallow, sloping pit cut through the plaster and domatochoma floor and down into the MM IlA fill, may have been intended to rob out some kind of paving slab or flooring; this was the pit that was filled with tephra, with a maximum thickness of 21 cm (Contexts 12b.12-12b.14-, plates 11 e, 12 a-b). The tephra fell or was washed into this pit, where it was preserved. Only a handful of sherds and two or three conical cups were recovered from the tephra layer, which was quite pure. Tiny, almost microscopic striations and occasional disarticulated tiny lenses of dirt as well as vertical lenses of dirt suggest the action of water. Most likely the pit had water in it when the tephra was deposited; and the tephra itself 53 Rupp and Tsipopoulou 1999 54 pkiv.; 289-90.</page><page sequence="63">PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN N S drain (cover slabs here robbed out, preserved to E.)

This deluge is at least in part responsible for our flooding episode testified throughout the building and in the street. Of course, there may also have been a tsunami (or even several); as likely as this may seem given the force and nature of the eruption and as convincing as one may find the widespread circumstantial evidence,56 we have no direct evidence from the town itself yet for such an event — hopefully the micromorphology samples taken during the 2003 excavation season in Room 12a and Street B-M will eventually provide some answers. CONTEXT 12A.1: ON SLABS IN DRAIN (#2899) (FIG. 2.22: 18) This material isolates only the last 5-10 cm above the slabs lining the drain in the w portion of the drain where the cover slabs had been robbed. The ceramics are MM IIB with parallels from Malia Quartier Mu. There is a join to Context 12a.2 (#2898). CONTEXT 12A.2: ON SLABS IN DRAIN (#2895, 2897-98) (FIG. 2.22: 18) As Context i2a.i, this comprises the soil above the slabs in the drain. Despite the evidence for the removal of the cover slabs and the refitting of the drain at the end of MM IIIA, most of the admittedly few ceramics from these contexts (12a.1 and 120.2) are MM II, but here there may be some later (MM IIIB) as well; perhaps the lowest layer of the silted-up drain (i.e. Context i2a.i) was never cleared during the refitting of the drain. CONTEXT 12A.3: LATER TERRACOTTA DRAIN CHANNEL (#6796-97) (PLATE 11 C~d) In the E part of the drain where the cover slabs had not been removed, a terracotta drain channel (10306) was set well above the original stone lined floor of the drain. It was carefully propped up by stones and placed above an inverted ledge-rim cup. The channel itself was complete and of a type known from previous excavations.57 Normally this would have been part of a longer stretch of interlocked channels but no others were found; they may have been robbed out in LM IA or this piece may have been used in some alternative fashion, perhaps to control the excessive flow and control sidewall erosion. 55 Textor et al. 2006. 56 Bruins et al. 2008. 67 PKIV, 289-90, fig. 16, pis. XII and XIII.</page><page sequence="64">BLOCK M ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY 39 CONTEXT 12A.4: E END OF DRAIN (#6788, 6792-93) This context comprises the E end of the drain where its cover slabs were intact. It provides therefore a terminus ante quem for the first construction of the drain and a terminus post quern for its modification. Though small, scrappy and undiagnostic, there is some indication of MM III (a straight-sided cup with ripple). CONTEXT 12A.5: W END OF DRAIN (#2892-94) (FIG. 2.22: 17) This context consists of upper levels from the w end of the drain, from which the cover slabs were robbed (in contrast to the E portion). Some MM II sherds still occur; but, unsurprisingly, there is also later material, some with dark-on-light wavy patterns that could belong in LM IA. CONTEXT 12A.6: LATE SURFACE ALONG WALL 8ll (#6741, 6776) Wall 811 is the s wall of Room 12a. There was a narrow surface just beyond the edge of the drain that may go with the remodelling of Wall 811 and the cutting of a doorway through into Room 11a. If so, these are some of the most coherent signs of LM IA activity aside from the pitting. The pottery is meagre and difficult to place, however. CONTEXT 12A.7: TUMBLE ABOVE DRAIN (#2882, 2885, 2846) (FIG. 2.22: 2) This tumbled material above the drain post-dates its use. There is still some MM II material, as well as obvious LM IA. CONTEXT 12B.1: HARD SURFACE AT IO.60-10.70! (#2811, 6795, 2889 and 2890; E of wall 835: 6789. 679°) A hard surface at 10.60-10.70T pre-dates the filling and construction activities at the start of MM IIB (cf. the drain in neighbouring Room 12a). This context covers much of the room, and is found either side of Wall 835, which sits directly on this surface and of which only one course is preserved. Wall 607 was flush with this surface but continued down — whether this wall was robbed or was built in a slope (as it seemed to be) is uncertain. Walls 614 and 611 also continued down and it is possible that these walls are earlier (i.e. MM I) but more likely that they were simply dug down into the underlying strata. The pottery from these zembils is largely MM I—II, as is the overlying fill, and the two may belong together; however, some distinction between levels was noticed in excavation. The presence of a cross-join with Context 12b. 12 (the main tephra pit, see xoi) is not surprising as the pit had cut into the earlier fill and perhaps even extended below it. CONTEXT 12B.2: FILL (#2806, 2808, 2810) (FIG. 2.22: 19) Immediately above the hard surface and material of Context i2b.i sits Context 12b.2, a substantial MM IIA fill. This fill was in many cases cut through by pits and hence mixed with LM IA, but here, in Context 12b.2 at the w of the room, the fill is found undisturbed. CONTEXT I2B.3: EARLY BENCH (#2807) While excavating the clay surface (at 10.60-10.70T) an area was noticed that seemed to be of different soil: apparently lined with mud plaster and running up against the face of Wall 607. This is referred to here as Context 12b.3. It is subsequently seen to connect with Wall 614, perhaps in the form of a low bench up against it; this wall is an earlier phase of Wall 607. It is difficult to distinguish from the overlying MM IIA fill. The pottery in the single zembil is consistent with early MM II. CONTEXT 12B.4: FILL (#2798, 2802-05) Like Context 12b.2, Context 12b.4 is part of the extensive fill below the plaster floor, though more towards the centre of the room. The pottery includes plain tumblers, a ribbed carinated cup, offset bases and white-on-dark decoration, all features consistent with MM IIA. CONTEXT 12B.5: SCHIST SLABS TO N OF DRAIN (#6747-49) This is a small context above the schist slabs just to the N of the drain at its far E end. These looked at first like steps, with a second step comprised of a line of small stones set directly over the drain after</page><page sequence="65">4° PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN the drain was out of use and a third step at the surface just n of Wall 811 (Context 12 a.6). This may have been linked, via an added doorway in 811 to Room 11b, representing one of the few signs of such late (LM IA) construction/use. On further excavation, it became clear that the schist slabs, while perhaps reused as a step, were in fact the top of the sidewall of the drain. And while the slabs did lie directly below a later pit, cut in LM IA (Context 12b.11), the finds do seem to be consistent with MM II. CONTEXT 12B.6: PLASTER FLOOR (#2793, 2905, 2842-43) (FIG. 2.22: IO, 13) This sloping plaster floor was laid directly over the fill noted above and best preserved along the Wall 609 and bench 608. The floor sloped down sharply as it neared these walls, then turning up at an acute angle and running up the face of the wall/bench where it was preserved up to 10 cm high. The large pit in Context 12 b. 12 was dug in mature LM IA from well above (10-15 cm at least) the level of the plaster floor and served to redistribute the MM II fill it cut into as well as introducing much LM IA material. Unfortunately, the only contexts that securely captured a layer directly over the plaster floor were almost devoid of pottery and had nothing diagnostic. It might be imagined, however, that even if originally laid in MM II, the floor carried on in use (or perhaps with some clay re-laying) into MM III. On the other hand, there may also have been some higher floor now lost in this area too; in any case, the material is mostly a mixture of MM II and LM IA. context 12B.7: plaster floor (#2781-84, 2787-88, 2791, 2827-28, 6780) (contaminated) This context is from w of the area cut by pits, although it is still disturbed and could be merged with Context 12b. 6. CONTEXT 12.B.8: BENEATH PLAQUES (#2903-04) (FIG. 2.22: ll) This context consists of the soil beneath one of the sandstone plaques in the north-central part of the room. This could feasibly have been used as a pithos stand, although no pithos fragments come from the area. This material was uncontaminated by pits; unfortunately these zembils do not contain any diagnostic pottery. CONTEXT 12B.9: BAKING PLATE PIT (#2790) (FIG. 2.22: 8) This small pit cut down into the MM II plaster floor and ran partly over Wall 607. It was fitted with a baking plate and is to be associated with the LM IA dismantling/squatter phase of the building. context 12B.10: pit (#2779, 2786, 2792, 2848-50, 2852-53 and 2817-18) (fig. 2.22: 14) This pit is just to the SE of the baking pit, and it too overlies Wall 607. It is w of two other large pits (to be described below), and while their exact interrelationship remains unclear, and all date to LM I A, this one is probably the earliest. We may note a low conical cup (770) that is not a common type and could be either MM IIIB or LM IA. Generally there is less obvious LM IA material from this pit than from the other two. CONTEXT 12B.li: PIT E OF TEPHRA PIT (#6774-75, 6783* 6777, 6773, 6739, 6744, 6740, and 6745-46) This pit was E of the main tephra pit at the far E side of Room 12b and had been cut by that (later) pit. As with the other pits in this room, the latest pottery is LM IA. CONTEXT 12B.12: TEPHRA PIT (#2875-78, 2880, 2883-84, 2886, 2889, 2891, 2901, 2931, 6779-87, 6794) (fig. 2.22: 16, 16a; PLATES 11 e, 12 a-b) This is the largest pit in Room 12b and the one into which the tephra fell or settled (for analysis, see Appendix, sample PKV 22), with this material consisting largely of the contents of the pit beneath the tephra itself, which was fairly pure (Context 12b. 13). This pit was dug in LM IA through the earlier floor level and into the MM IIA fill and there were joins through to the tephra above and the MM II fill below. After removing the tephra, the shape of the pit was clear: a roughly square, shallow, sloping depression. The sides of the pit extended at least 10-15 cm above (and sloped over) the plaster floor, showing that the floor was out of use and the pit dug from a higher level. The shape of the pit</page><page sequence="66">BLOCK M ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY 41 suggests a paved floor robbed out at this time. The LM IA sherds continued down 40 cm into the fill but not to the very bottom; there were also fresco fragments. Joins include 98, the mouth of a beaked jug that has a join with Context 12b.1 (#6786 and #6795) at the bottom of the pit, and the strainers 785 and 786, which show cross-joins with #6770, 6772, 6774, 6782 and 6786, thus giving joins from the top of the tephra to the bottom of the pit and suggesting that the pit was full of water and perhaps some turbulence when the tephra was deposited, as indicated by the condition of the tephra itself (Context i2b.i3). CONTEXT 12B.13: TEPHRA (#6778, 2874) (FIG. 2.22: 15; PLATES 11 e, 12 d~b) This is the actual tephra deposit overlying Context 12b. 12. It included two LM IA conical cups (uncatalogued) and c. 15 small sherds. Preliminary observations from the examination of a micromorphology sample encompassing this pit, top to bottom, show an increase in turbation and the presence of tiny shells towards the bottom of the tephra layer, but indicate that the entire tephra deposit was fully inundated by water (i.e. the pit was full of water and the tephra settled to the bottom).58 CONTEXT 12B.14: ABOVE TEPHRA (#6769, 6770, 6772, and 2854-56) (FIG. 2.22: 2) This material from above the tephra deposit may also belong within LM IA rather than in early LM IB, when Block M sees the digging of two deep wells and the construction of a boundary wall; it is in any case a fine distinction. Room 13 (figs. 2.23-2.24; plate 12 c) This room forms a large, seemingly featureless space N of the main court (Room ga). It is bounded by the massive terrace/facade walls: 610 to the E and 640 at the N. Wall 577, the N wall of Room 8 and Court 9a, continues at least partway into this room. At the N there is a narrow opening, taken to be a blocked doorway in Wall 640; this was filled with an MM IIIB destruction deposit that had fallen outside the wall (plate 12 c) (see also Room 16). Otherwise this space remains a puzzle. The latest levels (Context 13.3) show silt accumulation (assignable to LM IA, see below) on a surface composed of large sharp gravel chips embedded in a hard plaster matrix that is exactly the same as the underlying surface in the court (Room 9a) to the s. There in the s this seems to have been the under-floor surface for a higher level of plaster and slabs but no such higher levels were preserved in Room 13 (and the surface was some 10 cm lower than in Room 9). This rough plaster surface stops clearly along the line of Wall 577 and possibly indicates both its continuation and a return to the n.59 Why two such plastered areas would be divided by a wall remains a mystery; perhaps it was rather some other kind of paving, such as a raised walkway, but Wall 577 does still divide the space for 2.5 m. Some indication of round columns (shown by a circular area of red soil) at the area where the stones of Wall 577 petered out might suggest some kind of entrance between Rooms 9 and 13. Immediately below this empty surface was the usual MM IIA fill (Context 13.2) and some early walls on a different alignment. These walls were not fully excavated so little more can be said about them. They did seem to match the alignment and may be a continuation of Wall 617 in Room 18. CONTEXT 13.1 (#5737) Along the w side of Wall 610 was found a very different dark brown soil and MM IA material. This may relate to the possible earlier walls 617 and 618 in Room 18. context 13.2 (#6601, 6603-04, 3528, 3532-33, 3536-38, 3540-42, 3594-605, 5730-36) (fig. 2.24: 3, 5) This consists of material from the lower levels in Room 13; typical MM IIA fill, as discussed in Chapter 4, though often quite worn.

This silty, gravely wash was found throughout large open areas in Block M and often ran over the tops of walls, suggesting that the Building was already largely abandoned prior to the LM IA flooding event.60 Room 14 (figs. 2.23-2.24) Room 14 is a small cist or closet formed in the North Facade 640; it may have served as a closet like Room 1 oa or Room 45 in the NW building; or it may simply have been a structural addition. Wall 640 is just over 1 m wide to the E of Room 14 but narrows to 70 cm at this point. Despite their size, these walls are rather loosely constructed of rubble but with frequent large boulders. The E wall of Room 14, Wall 901, has a row of oblong slabs that span the full width of the wall. Room 14 contained a large earthquake deposit (Context 14.1) similar to Rooms 10a and 11a and Room 45, but seemingly continuous with deposits all along Wall 640 and hence unlikely to have ever fit entirely into the room (see Context 16a. 2). 60 Contexts StrBM.j, 4 and 5 are the clearest and most definitive flood contexts but evidence for flooding comes from throughout the Block.</page><page sequence="68">BLOCK M ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY 2.

It is not certain that this material all came from this room/cupboard (see Context i6a.2). Room 15 (figs. 2.23-2.24) No wall or division was found between Rooms 15 and 13. Room 15 is bounded by Walls 649 to the N, 708 to the w and 577 to the s. In MM II—III, early versions of 577 and 708 bordered the room to the s and w though there must have been some communication with Room 8 as the schist paving continued from Room 8 (Context 8.1) and was perhaps robbed from Room 15 (one possible slab was found, but no plaster etc.); or the paving stopped at a line under the later Wall 577 (the earlier phase of this wall did not extend all the way w to 708). At the N, Wall 649 must have suffered some damage as it has been massively shored up.

Most of the finds were lying flat or upside down at 10.40T. Room i6a and i6b (figs. 2.25-2.26; plate 12 c, d) Though outside the SE building proper, this room is most conveniently treated here. Below a massive MM IIIB collapse were three small walls: 722, 723 and 724 with a burned deposit of MM II pottery between them (Context i6a.i). Walls 722 and 723 continue to the ne beyond Wall 724 but then abruptly stop; Wall 724 was only a single course and one stone wide but did separate the deposits on either side, which were somewhat higher to the N of 724. In 16a (s of 724) the deposit ran underneath Wall 722 (and probably 723 as well) but it was contained by and did not run under Wall 724. In 16b the deposit was a bit higher up. Walls 722 and 733 may be buttresses for Wall 640 or a makeshift construction of temporary purpose. The limited number of cooking, pouring and eating/drinking vessels, together with charcoal, some bone and a pot full of some red pigment within a small, simple and seemingly unfinished rectangular construction with low walls might suggest that we are looking at builders' debris. Certainly red was the principal colour for plaster throughout the area, and a simple fire pit would explain the slapdash low-walled construction. As this pottery (from Context i6a.i) can be assigned to late MM IIB, then it points to construction activity in this period in the building, evidence for which we have encountered</page><page sequence="69">PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN Fig. 2.25.

CONTEXT 16a.2 (#1862-66, 5750-65, 5780) (FIG. 2.26: 4) A large MM IIIB deposit along the n side of Wall 640 consists of tumble relating to the seismic destruction which was also responsible for the MM IIIB material in Rooms 14, 10a, 11a, 45 etc. In particular this deposit is probably continuous with Context 14.1 and resembles material dumped outside the walls following a clean-up, rather than in situ collapse. Part of this dumping process caught up pieces of plaster, as elsewhere in Block M (see Room 19 below). A piece of fresco with imitation stone veining of red wavy lines is illustrated here (10755, plate 35 a).

On this floor was a deposit of burned debris, including charcoal, burned seeds and ripple ware pottery — including the fine bridge spouted jar (636) interpreted as a foundation deposit.61 We do not know how this structure relates to anything else in the area.

Room 18 (figs. 2.22, 2.29) A large space outside the Southeast Building, Room 18 is formed by Wall 611 to the s and 610 and 622 to the E and w. In the nw of the room, cut by Wall 610, were two small early walls, 617 and 618, on a different alignment. Though no floors were found these walls were associated with MM IIA pottery. The N wall, 617 probably continues and was noted in a test sunk in Room 13 also associated with MM IIA pottery, though earlier than the other MM II walls in the test. These walls are only 20 30 cm wide, built of small stones closely packed and set on bedrock. There seems to be an opening in Wall 610 here but no corresponding floor or level was found in Room 13 for it to lead to. A large pit along Wall 611 was dug in LM IA and afterwards filled in with stones; the top of this filled-in pit appears in the 1904 plan (and thereafter) as an odd, rough wall.62 61 MacGillivray et al. 1999. 62 PKII, pi. VI.</page><page sequence="72">BLOCK M ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY 47 CONTEXT 18.1 (#3545-49) This comprises two small walls, 617 and 618, lacking any floors to go with them. They pre-date Wall 610. Their alignment and construction suggests they belong with remains of MM IB-IIA date (Contexts 50.1 and ga.i). The pottery is consistent with MM IIA. CONTEXT 18.2 (#2775-77, 2794-97, 2839, 3532-33, 3536-38) (FIG- 2.22:4,5) This context consists primarily of MM II material just to the N of Wall 611, which has been disturbed by the LMIA robbing pit on that wall (see fig. 2.22: 4). The pottery is primarily MM IIA, with some intrusive glossy dark-on-light LM IA sherds. Street B-M (figs. 2.30-2.31; plate 12 e-f) Street B-M was first excavated by M. Tod in 1904; he noted its odd width where it joins Main Street and seems also to have uncovered Wall 835.6:1 Below the earliest street surface was a deposit of EM IIB pottery of good preservation at 10.30T, which perhaps suggests the existence of a nearby structure, though no architecture was found in our small (40 x 40 cm) test (Context StrBM.i). The first street surface was of tightly packed cobbles at 10.45! (Context StrBM.2), with a step (or steps) roughly halfway along its length, rising up to the s to c. 10.75?; the pottery dates this street surface to MM IIIA. A covered drain ran along the w side, next to Wall 719 and perhaps partly under its robbed-out continuation. It has slipped down and out into the street, probably as a result of seismic disturbance but possibly due to erosion. There is a point in the side-wall of this drain where there may be a blocking; possibly an early entrance (which we expect in this area) but not enough remains to be sure. A later (MM IIIB?) drain channel was created by setting vertical slabs along part of the cobbled surface, which seems to have stayed in use. The gutter in this phase was between these vertical slabs and the outside wall of the earlier drain. At some point the lower part of the street was allowed to silt in, forming a continuous, though sloping surface with the upper cobbles, which stayed in use. This earth surface and the higher cobbled street were finally inundated in a complex flooding episode at the time of the Theran eruption. The drain channel on the w side of the street was choked with debris — pottery, bone and various lenses of silt and gravel; this wash was continuous to the E across and over the vertical slabs and the cobbles as well. In the silted-in part of the street to the N, a rivulet, cut by flowing water, was filled in with Theran tephra which must have washed away elsewhere, then silt settled above that, leaving a discrete stripe. The progression of the flood deposition was clear: the larger heavier rubble and pottery fragments were precipitated first with a rocky, large gravel, then gradually finer layers of gravel, sand and silt were deposited across the whole street (Context StrBM.3). The s end of the Street was at least partly excavated by Tod; while we found neither our cobbled street nor our LM IA flood horizon in the narrow test dug here (Context StrBM.5), the material, perhaps re-deposited, was the same. Wall 835 is a late build — perhaps LM III; the flood deposit does run underneath it. Wall 830 at the E is also late, and was more likely street paving rather than an actual wall, since it had flat slabs at its top course. Wall 707 is an LM IB construction of varied character and curving shape, built as a kind of enclosure wall surrounding the block. CONTEXT STR BM.i: EM IIB DEPOSIT AT 10.30! (#6798) (FIG. 2.31: 8) This is a small deposit from a test below the earliest (cobbled) street surface at 10.45T. The material is larger and better preserved than the very small and scrappy bits of EM II we find on early pre building surfaces from below the SE Building proper where we suspect clearance prior to construction. CONTEXT STR BM2: COBBLED SURFACE AT IO.45T (#6624-25) (FIG. 2.31: 6) This is a well-cobbled surface at 10.45T with fist- to melon-sized cobbles, tightly packed. Lying directly on the cobbles was a large body sherd from a bridge spouted jar with white-on-dark spirals (283); the other material here likewise fits into MM IIIA; certainly nothing present is as late as MM IIlB. The upper cobbled surface to the s stayed in use but these lower cobbles were left to silt in.

Room 12a (which joined the street drain at the point where the lower cobbles were silted in), the covered drain below Wall 707 that subsided into the street, and the silting/flooding horizons in Room 6, it all adds up to a fairly coherent picture of a period of flooding during MM III.

The presence of a lens of Theran tephra demonstrates that we are looking at a primary destruction context from the Minoan eruption of Santorini. The deposit was clearly the result of flooding, though whether due to heavy rainfall (the street was aligned with the slope of the hill and as we have seen in Context StrBM.2, prone to erosion and flooding), tsunami, or both, we cannot be certain yet.64 Both heavy rainfall and tsunami would be expected from such an event. In any case as might be expected, despite the fresh condition and many fresh breaks, this debris has travelled down the street and there were not so many joins and no complete vessels besides cups. This wash layer was continuous from the gutter, over the vertical retaining slabs and across the upper cobbled surface, which had remained in use. Amidst this debris were many animal bones (particularly jaw bones) and larger stones. To the N, where the lower cobbles had silted in and the street had an earth surface, a curving water-cut channel some 2-13 cm wide, 8 cm deep and 60 cm long was exposed; it tapered out to the N and disappeared into the baulk at the se, but had been cut down into the road surface amidst the flood deposit. This rivulet bed had filled in with Theran tephra, which was then covered with a layer of fine gravel and then silt. 64 Forthcoming microstratigraphical analysis of samples taken of these strata will hopefully settle the question.</page><page sequence="75">5° PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN CONTEXT STR BM.4: UPPER LEVELS ABOVE FLOOD DEPOSIT (#6750, 6722-23, 6580-82, and 6618-ig) (fig. 2.31: 1, 2) These are the uppermost layers and may relate to early LM IB activity in the area following the Theran eruption: the robbing of Wall 719 and the construction of Wall 707; the rebuilding of Wall 702 at the s and of course the insertion of the two wells, 576 and 605.65 Included here are some zembils that are mixed, and were cut down into the flood deposit (#6722 in particular). CONTEXT STR BM.5: UPPER LEVELS AND FLOOD-WASH MIXED (#5690-98) (FIG. 2.31: 10) This context comes from just outside Room 1a in Street B-M, s of the contexts listed above. It runs from surface layers down to a dense tumble of stones with much plaster mixed in. The material seems to have the character of flood-wash, and the diagnostic pottery makes it likely that this flood event occurred during the course of the LM IA period (see also Context StrBM.j), although of course a later date cannot be ruled out either. Note also that some possible modern contamination occurs and this may still be backfill from the 1902-06 excavations. Southeast Building: Summary The Southeast Building is the only structure yet excavated at Palaikastro with such a sizable enclosed court. The walled, seemingly open area at the ne of Block B, for example was badly eroded and only '. . . superficially excavated',66 and the typical 'Palaikastro Hall' or four-columned impluvium, as found in Blocks B, A, T and X, tends to be around 35 m2with only the impluvium itself (4-5 m2) open to the sky.67 Room g (a + b) encloses c. 95 m2 of which c. 34 m2 would have been open to the sky. To look at it another way, the total area of the Southeast Building is c. 437 m2 of which 21.7% is the court. This is virtually unknown in Minoan domestic architecture.68 This detail alone suggests that the Southeast Building served some supra-domestic function. Furthermore, given that the court and reception room arrangement of Rooms 3 and 9a is found more commonly in the palaces at Knossos, Malia, Phaistos, and Kato Zakros, we may wonder if the eating and/or drinking ceremonies performed here were distinctive both in the number of participants, and in the formal links to a central Cretan power. While there was no doubt a blurring or interweaving of political and religious authority and most communal acts probably contained elements of both spheres, the architectural form here in the Southeast Building, of a central court with surrounding rooms and equipment for large ceremonies involving drink (and probably food), seems more political than explicitly religious.69 Interestingly, the reverse may be true of the next building to be considered. SOUTHWEST BUILDING (figs. 2.32-2.38; plates 13-14) The Southwest Building presents such a clear corner, with double fagade walls, that it looks to be a truly separate structure even though the wall foundations uncovered are on the same alignment as the Southeast Building. Unfortunately, the relationship between the two is anything but clear. M. Tod excavated in 1904 along Main Street (plate 2 a) and uncovered a series of walls that line up with the ones excavated during the recent campaign but no deposits were deemed worthy of description and nothing found to help us understand the use and function of this structure. The angled walls and casemate-like construction of Rooms 25, 26, and 27 somewhat resemble parts of Blocks Delta (particularly the rooms at the nw) and X 51-66 (at the w end of that block) (fig. 1.1). This building also shows much more evidence for habitation and even construction in LM IA, particularly in the suite of Rooms 29-32. While Wall 590 in Room 32 goes back to MM IIIA, and Walls 582 and 583 may also be earlier, Walls 586, 597, and the steps and bench in Rooms 29 and 30, as well as the massive doorway into Room 32 were probably added in LM IA. This latter suite of rooms actually lies between the MM III Northwest Building and the Southwest Building proper; but since these rooms were created by the addition of the North Fagade of the Southwest Building, and since they seem if anything to be more important than the small rooms contained within the building, they are considered here. 65 PK Wells. 66 PK II, 289. 67 Block B Room 11 (PK II, 287, pi.

A test dug just w of Wall 526 revealed another LM IA pit (see especially Rooms 12 and 18), found filled in with large stones (Context 19.2). Below the pit was a layer of undisturbed MM IIB or IIIA accumulation (Context ig.i). There is no evidence for any intervening MM IIIB level. This may have been a continuation of an internal alleyway running s from Room 53, above Rooms 48-50, through Room 20 and here out to Main Street. To the s, in the part of this building that fronted Main Street, M. Tod, excavating trial trenches in 1904, found only walls (which generally line up with those uncovered more recently). A large quantity of material, presumably from the MM IIIB earthquake, had been dumped along Walls 704 and 708 (Context 19.3). Included were a number of fragments of plaster with fresco decoration (initially identified as vetch or pea70 but more likely tri-lobed sage;71 colour plate I a-c). We do not know the original placement of this fresco. Stylistically the fresco has been suggested as belonging within LM IA,7-' and, given its context of re-deposited material with a terminus post quem of MM IIlB, this is certainly possible, and it may even be associated with the paved Room 32; but given the date of the material in the pit, it is perhaps more likely to have been part of the MM IIIB furnishings of the Southeast Building. CONTEXT 19.I (#2724) From a sounding at the s of Room 19, this comprises MM IIB-IIIA material; one of few such contexts in the SW Building. This pre-dates Wall 526, which is constructed in LM IA. context 19.2 (#2700-09, 2722-23 and 2725) This is LM IA material from upper levels in the s. There does not appear to be anything later, such as LM IB or even LM III, in this space; but given that this is close to where M. Tod was excavating in 1904, we imagine the upper levels to have been removed. context 19.3 (#0696, 0726-27, 0842-44, 0882, 0901-05) This context lies at the N of Room 19, and consists of material from a pit running under Wall 526 with rounded pebbles at the bottom and a dense mixture of sherd, plaster and mud brick fragments. The tri-lobed sage fresco, 10765 (see Chapter 9), with fragments from #0696, 0726-7 and 0842, comes from this pit, which had primarily MM IIIB pottery in it, from the earthquake destruction. Although we cannot be sure, due to the nature of this context, the sage fresco seems also to have been part of the MM IIIB rubble. Wall 526 then has a terminus post quem of MM IIIB as it sits directly on the pit fill. Note that this context is contiguous with Contexts 8.18 (#8028-29, 8032) and part of Context 6.3 (#7790-92). Room 20 (fig. 2.33) This is a narrow alley between Wall 708 (later 563), the w wall of Room 15 to the E, and Wall 564, the e wall of Room 34 to the w. It may have been an external space giving access to the paved Room 32 and communicating between the nw and sw buildings; the construction of Well 576 has obscured this relationship. context 20.1 (#3490, 3492, and 3483, 3498 and 3502, 3484-85 and 3487) Generic MM III/LM IA. Room 2 1 (fig. 2.34) Only partially excavated, this room is bounded to the w and N by Walls 594 and 591 respectively. Wall 594 is a typical narrow internal wall, 30 cm wide, rubbly but with a few good stones at the corner; 591 is 50 cm wide, strongly bonded to its return N (the stub wall 593, less so to 594 which abuts the corner of 591 and 593. Exactly the same pattern can be seen in Room 5, where Wall 662 is built against the strong corner of 654 and 570. It is tempting to see this as a construction practice rather than an indication of true phasing, but the latter possibility remains open. 70 PK 1991, 128, fig. 6. 71 J. A.

CONTEXT 21.i: HARD EARTH FLOOR WITH SIGNS OF BURNING AT 1 I.75T (#5540-41) The ground is higher here than elsewhere in the building. There were small quantities of barely diagnostic material, though generically MM III-LM I A. No further tests were done here and only the top course of the walls exposed. Rooms 22, 23, 24 (fig. 2.34-2.35; plate 13) These three axial rooms formed by stub walls 592 and 593, with long e-w walls 591 (at s) and 582 (at n) and Wall 583 to the s, form a somewhat unusual arrangement at this site of three rooms axially aligned with a paved threshold/vestibule and aligned door openings. The only good parallels at Palaikastro are the far se part of Block B, Rooms 40, 42, 43 and 44,73 which yielded an offering table, miniature horns of consecration and two stalactites; and the LM IB shrine in Building 5 where only the first two door openings aligned; the third (into the storeroom at the back of the shrine) was set on the other side; but this example also has a paved threshold/vestibule. This may be a cultic layout, though without finds one cannot be sure of room function in this case.74 Rooms 22, 23, and 24 are also aligned with the central E-w spine of the SE building (Room 8 Wall 571 — Room 9a stoa — 9b platform), though this may be coincidence as it may also result from the original construction or even planning. The stub walls, considering their purpose, are well built with two good faces; 593 is 60 cm wide, 592 50 cm. There appears to be a drain in the doorway between Rooms 24 and 23, but it was not fully excavated. The walls here, as exposed, do not resemble the typical small stone rubble noted particularly in the sw rooms (4, 5, 6 and 7) of the SE building; rather they tend to be built with two faces and rubble and earth filling, a more solid and regular stonework. They also show more evidence of use in LM IA. 73 PKII, 289 and pi. VI. 74 Storerooms, for example, also can have aligned doorways as at Zakros or Malia Quartier Mu, though the original access to the connecting rooms/corridor is usually bent, not axial as here.</page><page sequence="80">BLOCK M ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY 1.

CONTEXT 24.1: PAVING AT C. 11.66T (#1873-74, 1876-77) The paved vestibule, with a higher floor level than Rooms 22 and 23, had a pebbly wash (common in open areas of the Block in LM IA deposits) to the w; the material was undiagnostic. There were stones at the w end of the space that might have formed a wall, in which case this room would have had a bent access as with some storerooms (see note 57). Rooms 25, 26, 27 (fig. 2.36; plate 13) Directly N of 22, 23, 24, these small closed spaces form a kind of casemate construction that is fairly well paralleled at the site particularly in Block X 51-66.75 The total effect here though, with the double wall and steps to the E and the axial rooms 22-24, is nonetheless distinctive. All of these walls are strongly built with good stones. Wall 582, the s wall of this unit, shows a projected foundation course (or possibly an earlier face; but more likely all part of the same construction). Wall 586 at the N jogs slightly where it meets 585, the short cross-wall dividing 25 and 26; there is a stub wall here projecting to the N. In some cases — 586 in Room 25, 585 and 582 in room 26 — a row of small stones is used for interior faces. Walls 586 and 582 become a double wall at the E end of Room 27; the strongly built corner of 586 and 597 may have served to support the corner of 582 and 583. Another stub wall or bench, 567 was built against 586 just N of Room 27; and there are two wide steps, supported by a well-built corner (but only a corner; the walls do not continue) to the E. Room 26 is 1.2 x 1.6 m; Room 25 measures 1.3 m wide and at least 2 m long; Room 27 is only 0.8-0.5 m wide and again 2 m long. Such strongly built walls for such small spaces and the casemate-style of the rooms themselves must have served to support a substantial second storey or perhaps a balcony or open area that needed to be able to support a large crowd.

Burning was noted both here and to the s of Wall 660. context 28.1 (#1903-08, 1911-14, 1895-98) This is a deposit of Theran tephra, and worn, fragmentary LM IA pottery. Rooms 29, 30, 31, 32 (figs. 2.37-2.38; plates 13-14) This area, formed by Walls 554, 565, 560, and 590 to the N and 586 to the s, seems to be at least partly open space between the SW and NW buildings, particularly Rooms 30 and 31. Room 29 might well have been roofed; and 32 almost certainly was. Certainly, by the time of the Theran eruption the western rooms were an open space, as attested by the washed-in silt and debris. These spaces are also axially aligned and gradually narrow from the quite wide and open Room 31 to Room 29 (plate 14 a), fitted with double steps (or benches?) and a horseshoe-shaped burnt mud brick construction in the centre of the room — some low installation, perhaps a hearth (plate 13 b-c). Then further E is the finely-paved Room 32, with schist slab floor and a curious circular arrangement of small slabs leaving a circle (D. 20 cm) in the middle (for a thin column or post?; fig. 2.38). There was evidence of burning, charcoal, mud brick and ash, in Room 29 especially; and a pithos base in situ at the w end of the lower step (plate 14 b). With the possible exception of the projecting stub off 586 and the bench 567 the s walls of this area form a facade for the rooms to the S (25-27) and thus only incidentally help to create these rooms to the N. Likewise the n wall 565: while Rooms 29 and 32 do seem to have walls constructed expressly for them, Room 30 and 31 do not. Despite their 'incidental' nature between buildings these rooms are larger and better appointed than even Rooms 22, 23, and 24. Room 32 in particular stands out: the large (1 m wide) corner wall 595 and the stub corner of Wall 596 form a massive doorway for the paved room. Wall 595 is indeed so solidly built that one must either accept the possibility of a much</page><page sequence="82">BLOCK M ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY Fig. 2.37. Plan of Rooms 28-32. Fig. 2.38.

The wall is built of boulders 25 x 30 x 60 cm in all three preserved courses, standing c. 60 cm above the surface in Room 35. Since the pottery right down to the foundations of the wall is LM IA, and as we have earlier structures and parts of earlier structures in the area and none aligns with or even resembles this kind of masonry, we</page><page sequence="83">5« PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN believe this to be an LM IA construction connected with the remodelling of the Southwest Building and the addition of the benches and stepped area in Room 29. Wall 560 is only a single stone in width, set at the same level as 595, and abuts both Walls 595 and 568. Wall 595 is built partly over Wall 590 (narrow and built of small stone rubble, as typical of MM III walls in the Southeast Building), which had a foundation trench with a pottery fill of MM IIIB date (Context 32.2) that towards the bottom had more complete vessels of MM IIIA (Context 32.1) but has been robbed out down to a level below the paving slabs. It is very tempting to associate these remains and the paved floor with the well-head of 576, so it must be stressed that there was nothing but LM IB pottery at the bottom of the Well which had cut through the LM IA paved floor.76 If there was a link between the LM IB Well and what was once in this paved room, it was eradicated completely when the well was put in. Still, we must wonder, with the progressively narrowing axial alignment, stepped area, hearth feature and monumental entryway, just what made Room 32 so special in LM IA; particularly as it was outside any of the three buildings in the Block. Both the Northwest and Southeast Buildings were in ruins following the MM IIIB earthquake; they chose to rebuild only the ne corner of the Southwest Building. When we consider that Well 576 was dug straight down into an aquifer-fed cavern,77 we wonder if there might been some sign of it previously — a wet patch or springhead, or perhaps a narrow crevasse that only appeared following the MM IIIB earthquake (which split the ground in Room 9a of the Southeast Building along a line running through this room).78 CONTEXT 29.1: POT DEPOSIT AT C. II.25T (#7758, 7765, 7769, 1889-92, 2753) This was concentrated in the centre of the room and to the e, with a number of pots datable to LM IA. CONTEXT 30.1: SURFACE AT C. II.19T (#2737-41, 2743-44) This comprised much fragmentary plaster, coarse ware and cooking pot fragments; the latest material is LM IA. context 31.1 (#1753, i755-56&gt; !762&gt; 1878-80) This is a poorly defined space. The material is scrappy and mostly undiagnostic, LM IA. CONTEXT 32.1: FOUNDATION TRENCH ALONG WALL 590, LOWER LEVELS (#7757 (7756)) The foundation trench ran along the s side of Wall 590, and its lower levels produced one of only two MM IIIA contexts found in the SW Building (see also Context 19.1). No distinction in the fill of the foundation trench was noted while excavating, and indeed #7756 is listed both here and below in Context j2.2, but towards the bottom of the trench the pots were much more complete and MM IIIA rather than IIIB; possibly this suggests a date early in MM IIIB for the construction of this wall, i.e. soon after the MM IIIA destruction noted in the Southeast Building. This hints at the possibility that more architecture in this building may go back to MM III, as in the Southeast Building, and indeed Wall 590 more closely resembles the MM III constructions in that building than it does the walls in Rooms 21-28 immediately to the s. CONTEXT 32.2: UPPER LEVELS IN FOUNDATION TRENCH FOR WALL 590 (#7756) These levels were higher up in the fill than the MM IIIA material of Context 32.1, and derive from excavation along the s side of Wall 590 where paving slabs were missing; possibly these were two separate layers — an earlier foundation trench for Wall 590 overlain by a room-wide fill below the paving slabs, but if so it was not apparent during excavation (hence the cross-listing of #7756). This context amounted to almost a whole 1x2m table of pottery, including large thick hearth fragments; the fragmentary pieces from #7756 date to MM IIIB, while the more complete pots from this zembil probably belong with the MM IIIA part of the deposit described above. 76 PK Wells, fig 1.4 77 PK Wells ii. 78 Why the focus on Room 32? Why the massive doorway, steps and benches? Why would they choose that spot — a paved room — to sink a Well in LM IB? And why be so lucky as to hit a cavern fed by an aquifer? Perhaps they were led by a skilled dowser; perhaps the construction all served some other, unknown function.</page><page sequence="84">BLOCK M ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY 59 CONTEXT 32.3: MATERIAL ON SCHIST PAVING AT 1 I.12T (#1894, 1899, 7753, 7755, 7761) The gravel packing that filled the foundation trench (Context 32.2) was also seen to run over the preserved top of Wall 5go which had been robbed out, probably in LM IA. Considering the deposit of LM IA cups and cooking debris in Room 34 to the n, we might speculate that Wall 5go, perhaps having suffered in the MM IIIB earthquake, was levelled at least in the w and rooms 34 and 32 combined in LM IA. We suspect that some version of the well, perhaps merely a crevasse or springhead was already present in this room, and that the creation of the very large and unusually shaped well head resulted from the attempt to further exploit the water source. There was an amount of pottery, covering a whole 1x2 table, with lots of cooking pot and coarse ware, but very little diagnostic; some dark-on-light sherds of LM IA type. The soil in this unit is silty, with some ash. context 32.4 (#3486, 3488-89, 3491, 3480 and 3482) This comprises upper levels from the e side of Room 32 with Well 576, constructed in LM IB.79 The pottery dates to LM IIIA2, and includes a catalogued conical cup (916) from #3489. Room 33 (fig. 2.32) s of Room 28, only the n 660 and w 583 walls were uncovered. context 33.x (#2766-69, igog-io) The upper levels may be contaminated by Bosanquet's dump, but the pottery is uniformly LM IA. It includes some very large pithos fragments as well. Southwest Building: Summary In general, the walls in this Southwest Building are strongly constructed, often a metre wide, and either form small compartments, such as 25, 26 and 27, or delimit spaces almost incidentally, as with 2g, 30, and 31. Other anomalous features such as the frequent projecting stub walls, and the double wall 583 and 5g7, the stepped area at the s of Room 29 and the aforementioned axial alignments are suggestive but puzzling; unfortunately, we have no evidence other than these foundations and limited deposits and so can only speculate. The massive corner of Wall 595 certainly looks like the corner of a major building, but there is little to which it can be connected on the plan. It does not seem that it could have linked up with the Southeast Building, and even its relationship to the Southwest Building is unclear, as it does not align with the double stepped corner of Walls 582, 586, 583 and 597. It does serve to create a monumental entryway for the paved Room 32 from the w. Wall 526 in Room 19 at the s seems also a LM IA construction and if it continued it may have served to close Room 32 off from the former alley running N-s from Street 5-M from Room 53, down over Rooms 48, 49, 50 and beyond. The construction of Well 576 in LM IB and Wall 563 in LM IIIA2 has obscured this part of Room 32 so we cannot say for sure. Three points suggested by the distinctive architecture do come to mind: 1. Much of what we see must have served an upper storey — particularly the casemate and double walls; but also the projecting stubs. 2. There is a strong possibility that the building served a different function from the rest of Block M and indeed, most of the site. 3. There may be a chronological distinction reflected by the different wall construction techniques.80 Three (not incompatible) hypothetical reconstructions satisfy those points: 1. Some kind of balcony existed looking down onto Rooms 2g~32, built up from the double and casemate walls and hence designed to bear large loads (i.e. large groups). 2. Storage. We do not have any evidence for storerooms in the Southeast Building — and virtually no storage vessels even in fragments. The plan of Rooms 24/23/22 shows parallels with known storerooms (e.g. Kato Zakros and Malia Quartier Mu and could have been for storage, though without any vessels it is impossible to say. There were pithos fragments, but from Room 33, outside the Southwest Building proper. 79 PK Wells. 80 Techniques of stone wall building cannot of course really be used as chronological indicators as they simply do not relate to time in the same way that, for example, ceramic styles do; however, they are evidence of a sort and should be taken into account. See MAMAT, and Shaw forthcoming.</page><page sequence="85">6o PALAIKASTRO BLOCK MI THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN 3. Cult. The axial alignments of Rooms 24/23/22 (which are also found in storerooms, see above, though usually the initial access is bent in storerooms) and, especially, 31/30/29/32 and the stepped (possibly a small 'theatral') area in Room 29, not to mention the small hearth might suggest this. Certainly the doorway into Room 32 from 29 is monumentalised and Room 32 itself was finely paved and had some kind of circular post or column set in the floor. The cup deposit from Room 34 (listed below in the Northwest Building) might be associated as the paving seems to have extended over part of Wall 590 (no slabs were found but the gravel packing ran over the wall at the same height). In contrast to the architectural remains of the Southeast Building, here we see architecture used for what is to us a mysterious end. We can well understand how the function of the central court in the Southeast Building might interact with the rooms around it and the material found therein; while there may be aspects of ritual behaviour, the kind of communal interaction suggested by the remains is of an ordinary and practical nature; the embellishments in paving and plastered decoration are in keeping with the scale and scope of the political interpretation of the spaces as given above. Here, in the Southwest Building the scale of the doorway into Room 32, the size and orientation of the open areas (which is actually between buildings and so in some ways incidental space), the benches and suggestion of a strongly reinforced balcony overlooking the area do not seem justified by any obvious practical purpose and taken by themselves suggest some other, perhaps religious, character to this structure. THE NORTHWEST BUILDING (figs. 2.39-2.60; plates 15-16) Rooms 39 through 47 comprise a reasonably coherent architectural unit with an entry/vestibule at 47, paved hall at 46, cupboard for drinking vessels at 45; staircase at 43 and wine press at 41/42. This is unlikely to have been a whole house but LM III disturbance at the nw in Rooms 54 through 63 has essentially eradicated or effectively concealed any earlier remains. Room 53 is a paved roadway that must have continued over 48-50, these latter being examples of earlier MM I—II structures predating the main phase of use (i.e. MM III). The roadway picks up (as a small alley turning w at this point) in 'Room' 36 which leads to the small two room structure of Rooms 37 and 38. Do rooms 34 and 35 belong then with the SW or NW complex? They are included here, but it should be noted that this kind of blurred boundary between enclosed spaces is not uncommon at Minoan sites and may indeed be a rough chronological indicator.81 Room 34 (fig. 2.40) This space is formed by Wall 590 to the s, Wall 561 at the E, 559 at the N and to the w connects with Room 35 via an opening between the heavily built corner buttress/jamb 595 and 559. In the s end of 561 the inner (w) face had been removed, creating a niche or space for a cupboard. Collapsed into this space was a deposit of conical cups and some cooking vessels. This does not seem to have been the original plan for this wall (i.e. it was accomplished by robbing out stones), and Wall 590 was also robbed out and (possibly) linked via paving to Room 32 to the s. Otherwise this space only communicates with Room 35. CONTEXT 34.1: COLLAPSED SHELF (#3494-97, 3499-501, 3503, 7754~55) A niche or cupboard had been cut into Wall 561; fallen pots, perhaps some from a shelf higher up included LM IA cooking and tablewares. Also found were a large fragment from a baking plate with ash and carbon and a tripod cooking pot; certainly we are looking at a kitchen deposit. Room 35 (fig. 2.40) Separated from Room 29 by a narrow partition wall 560 whose span of 30 cm is generally bridged by single flat stones, Room 35 had a roughly paved trodden surface with a scattering of slabs, some of which seem to have fallen. Wall 568 at the w is more substantial; but 559 to the N is again narrow and does not follow a true course. The surface in Room 36 (just N of 559), while similarly slabbed, is, at 81 See Wright 1996, 192-3, for the difficulty of discerning architectural boundaries in the MM III vernacular architecture at Kommos.</page><page sequence="86"></page><page sequence="87"></page><page sequence="88"></page><page sequence="89">Fig. 2-3g.

These N and s walls, 559 and 560, do seem to be additions; there has been a fair amount of rebuilding in this area (more than most of Block M) and so while most wall remains are visibly bonded the original plan is somewhat obscure; at this last phase Rooms 34 and 35 may have been a simple two room unit; though it is more likely they were linked to Room 32 via the robbed out Wall 590. LM IA pottery is found right down at the bottom of the massive Wall 595 which, along with the blocking wall 560, was probably built at this time. This then seems to be an area with activity in LM IA; as suggested by the kitchen deposit in Room 34 (Context 34.1) and the probable Theran tephra noted in the room. This is in clear contrast to the narrow suite of Rooms 36, 37, and 38 directly to the N which were wholly MM IIIB despite being some 50-60 cm higher asl. context 35.1: surface at 10.47T (#7745, 7749, 7759) This is just to the n of Room 29 in the SW Building. Upper levels are jumbled, largely Neopalatial but with some possible LM III contamination. There is painted plaster, and a layer of tephra (Theran?) that extends throughout the room; there is more stone tumble beneath it. There was a small LM IA pot deposit on a roughly paved surface at 10.47T; this probably goes with the kitchen in Room 34. Rooms 36, 37, and 38 (fig. 2.41) This series consists of an external alley between structures in the Block and a small two room suite; as it is immediately n of Rooms 30 and 31 (which themselves seem external) there may be a chronological progression with these being earlier (MM III). The N boundary of this space is Wall 562, which changed height and construction technique in each trench it was uncovered in and is instructive in understanding the space. At the se in Room (alley) 36 it is up to 1 m in width and preserved to 10.95?. Double-faced with rubble in the middle it is a strong external fa$ade wall with a bench opposite on Wall 559; further w, still in the alley but just before the entrance to Room 37 a buttress or rebuild (?) (or, less likely a bench) is added to Wall 562 forming a double wall, each part c. 65 cm wide but here preserved up to 11.30?; the original line is the N one despite its preservation at a slightly lower height. At the nw in Rooms 37 and 38, the wall is c. 45 cm thick and is only occasionally given a good face: an internal wall at this point and preserved to 11.19?. The s boundary to these spaces is Wall 565 to the w and 559 to the E. The continuation s of the massive LM III terrace/ enclosure Wall 469 extended over Wall 562 into Room 36. This E-w alley connects with the N-s alley that ran over early Rooms 48, 49 and 50 to the N and continued on through Rooms 20 and 19 to Main Street; though how the alley related to Room 32 has been obscured by later activity. context 36.1 surface at c. 10.98?

Plan of Rooms 36-38. were no slabs and no floor down to 10.90T though some tumble higher up at 11.08T. This was probably an external space, connecting to the road noted in Room 53 (see below), which originally continued s (that trench was not excavated) to this point. The pottery is all consistent with MM IIIB (see catalogue). CONTEXT 37.1: FLOOR AT 11.1 it (#7740) Room 37 lay mostly in the baulks; the small portion excavated had a floor with some patches of plaster at 11.1 it. Only a small amount of pottery was recovered, but is likewise MM IIIB. CONTEXT 38.1: FLOOR AT 11.12t (#2732, 2736) Here we see a similar floor at a similar height as in Room 37 (see above) and another bench (40 cm wide) along the N wall 562. This is a remnant of MM IIIB occupation, as found to the N, in Room 40. On the plaster floor was a medium quantity of pottery, broadly Neopalatial in date, with MM IIIB ledge-rim bowl fragments. Rooms 39 to 47 (figs. 2.42-2.49; plates 15-16) As noted above, the best candidate for a real architectural unit in the NW building is this area, with the entrance porch at Room 47, paved court at 46, staircase over 43 and 44 and a pantry in Room 45; also the wine press in Rooms 41 and 42 and a kitchen in Room 40. This unit probably continued w but LM III activity has obscured the earlier phases there. The size of the staircase that starts from the entrance vestibule at Room 47 and must have risen to the s over Room 43, turning over Room 44; and the substantial wine-making installation suggest a fairly grand building. Room 39 (fig. 2.42) A small blind room in the SE corner of the large Room 40; though contaminated by LM III activity, this small space probably does belong with the rest of Room 40, which seems, even architecturally, to belong to an early phase. CONTEXT 39.1 (#2731, 2733-35) We find here 1/2 a table of pottery, including LM IIIA2. This is a pattern that continues in Rooms 55-63 to the N. Room 40 (figs. 2.42-2.43) The w wall 532 was well built of small stones with a return 536 to the e; the later Wall 511 was built directly over it. The earlier wall construction does recall MM III construction elsewhere and, considering the phasing, may belong to the first major construction phase with Wall 511 on top being MM IIIB. Wall 511 continues into Room 41 and abuts the press installation (Room 42) suggesting that the press is MM IIIB if not earlier. The material here, including cooking pots and one of only two querns from this building, seems to belong to a kitchen.</page><page sequence="94">PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN Fig. 2.42.

CONTEXT 40.4: SUBSOIL OVER ROOM 40 (#0667, 0697 0717) (FIG. 2.43: 2) Because the walls survived well, Room 40 not only preserved a floor deposit of MM IIIA but even at topsoil was different from the material to the N and w (in the same trench) so those walls must have stayed viable or been reused as foundations. There is some disturbance in LM IIIA2. Rooms 41-42: The Wine-Making Installation (figs. 2.44-2.45; plate 15 a-c] Room 41 was bounded to the s by Wall 562; its further boundaries (and whether it communicated directly with Room 43) remain unknown. The E portion especially suffered from LM III pits, probably connected with the construction of the long N-s wall 469 a continuation of which was found running over Wall 562 at the point where it is a double wall, leaving a rather wide (2 m) gap. This massive late wall (85 cm wide and 11m long as preserved) created a division in deposits, as those to the w all suffered from LM III contamination while those to the E did not. Room 42 refers to the wine-making installation itself, comprising a plaster lined, low-walled tank, a patatiri, or grape-press (a large shallow ceramic basin with a large spout for pressing the must) and a large pithos for the fermentation of the wine.82 Presumably the grapes would have been dumped into the plaster tank, possibly trodden in order to break the skins, then left to macerate (the process whereby wine takes up colour, flavour and tannin from the stems and skins) until fermentation had begun (usually open tanks are used to initiate fermentation). Then the juice would be transferred (probably strained) into the collection pithos and the grape must pressed to extract juice. Fermentation would continue in the pithos, which was buried, probably to control the temperature of the ferment.83 The wine could then be left to settle and scooped out of the pithos using the dipper (643) or rhyton (651), both of which were found in this context, perhaps into a storage vessel (such as the fine pithoid jar 653 found here too) for further decanting and service. The plaster tank formed an internal rectangular area of c. 1.90 x 1.53 m, with walls 40-45 cm 82 For other Bronze Age Cretan wine presses, see Kopaka 1998. On ancient wine consumption, see McGovern 2009. 83 One of the oldest traditional wine-making practices in Georgia (F.S.R.) (where, according to modern DNA studies, cultivation of Vitis vinifera may have begun) buries the clay fermentation vessel (kvevri) in the earth to control the heat of fermentation. If the fermentation runs too hot the yeast will die and the fermentation becomes stuck. Modern wineries use cooling tanks or dry ice for this purpose.</page><page sequence="96">PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN Fig. 2.44.

The tank floor was at 10.80T, the top of the patatiri at 11.05Î, the top of the collection/fermentation pithos at 10.66T and the bottom of the pithos at 9.98. It is very likely that the present height of the walls is close to that of their original height. The floor of the tank slopes down from E to w, where the wall is preserved to a height of 21 cm. The plaster covers half of the top of the E wall, runs up against the N and w wall and partly against some parts of the S wall. The latter is in pisé and was hard to define except for some instances where the plaster was actually preserved vertically. The w wall is made of flat schist and limestone slabs and has only one good face on the inside, just like the s wall. The E wall has a good face on the outside but not on the inside. CONTEXT 41.1 (#5476-81) (fig. 2.45: 2b) This is the space surrounding the plaster lined tank. MM II-IIIA material, contaminated by LM IIIA2 pits and wall construction 469, was found.

CONTEXT 42.1: material FROM IN AND AROUND COLLECTION PITHOS (#5495, 5497-98, 5519) (fig. 2.45: 12) There is MM IIIA material inside the pithos — only a small amount of pottery, difficult to date but broadly assignable to MM II—III. Combined with other evidence, this might mean that this press had a long life, even stretching back into the Protopalatial period. A broken dipper cup (643) found inside the pithos must have been used for decanting the finished wine. Part of the pithoid jar (653) was found in the patatiri:; as the rest was broken on the floor of the tank, and the base fragment inverted (about 20 cm preserved) this jar may have been stored higher up on a shelf and fell, perhaps during the MM IIIB earthquake. CONTEXT 42.2: MATERIAL FROM plaster TANK (#5456-74) (FIG. 2.45: 2a) On the plaster floor we find modest amounts of material among which some dark-slipped cup fragments (carinated, hemispherical) that cannot be dated any more closely than MM II—III; these may even be connected with the construction of the press (see Context 42.1). The most spectacular find on the floor, however, is a striking pithoid jar with dark-on-light decoration of ripple and crescents with added white spirals (653). The vessel was broken but mostly intact upside down on the floor; the base already visible after removal of topsoil. Also found was 651, a relief quadruped rhyton cup, probably used in conjunction with the pithoid jar 653. On and just above the floor of the press, there is nothing later than MM IIIB (649 and 650, both rounded cups). Higher levels are disturbed by LM III activity, but the material left here was limited to items used in the space and set on shelves (i.e. not being used at the time of the earthquake). It was not clear if the plaster was freshly laid; but there is evidence for re-plastering from nearby (see Room 43, below) here and perhaps in the Southeast Building as well (Rooms 8 and 16). context 42.3 (#5447-55&gt; 5487&gt; 5494&gt; 5499-5°i) (FIG- 2-45: 0 Above the wine press; within the area affected by LM III activity and most of the material is a mixture of MM III and LM III; interestingly there is very little LM IA here, though it is not entirely absent. Room 43 (fig. 2.46; plate 15 d) Room 43 is formed by Walls 406 to the e and 463 to the w; it creates an L-shaped space around Room 44 where it is bounded to the S by 562 and to the N by Wall 580 (the s wall of Room 44). Wall 463 projects S beyond Wall 580 (see Room 45 above for similar projections; this construction practice is common throughout the Northwest and Southwest Buildings but was not found so much in the Southeast Building).

There was evidence for building work, notably large deposits of plaster, many seemingly scraped or removed from walls but also including the remains of a bucket or sack in perishable material that left a large lump of plaster 40 x 50 cm. A deposit of bone (including bovis) was also found here (report pending) amidst a sandy accumulation in a probable pit at 10.69-10.42?. context 43.1 (#5534, 5536) Found below the bone deposit, this possibly pre-dates the walls in this room. CONTEXT 43.2: BONE DEPOSIT (PIT?) AT C. IO.42-IO.69T (#5523-28, 5532, 5535) (plate 15 d) This consists of a dense pile of bones found amid a sandy/pebbly accumulation and pebble layers, but seemingly no floor level; nearby also a large (roughly 40 x 30 cm) lump of plaster, probably from a sack of perishable fabric (though no imprint was visible) perhaps relating to re-plastering of walls. The pottery is MM IIIB. The bone deposit was most likely in a pit not identified during excavation. CONTEXT 43.3: UPPER LEVELS (#5441, 5444-46, 5517, 5522) This yielded a fair amount of pottery (nearly three 1x2 tables), most of it MM IIIB and LM IA. No floors or occupation material were identified. Room 44 (fig. 2.46) As Room 43, this was the substructure for a grand staircase; Room 44 was possibly a light-well. The space was bounded by Walls 467 to the N, 463 to the E, 468 to the w, and 580 to the s. The room was only partly excavated. context 44.1 (#5518, 5529, 5531) No floors were identified, but the ceramic evidence suggests this space was used during the MM IIIB period, as is the case in Room 43 to the s and Rooms 45 and 46 to the N. Room 45 (figs. 2.47-2.48) Located s of the paved court at Room 46, this is a small closet full of MM IIIB pottery, almost all for the serving and consumption of liquids and perhaps some food (Context 45.4).

The contents and description of this MM IIIB closet have been published elsewhere.84 However in a deep sounding Walls 479 and 480 were revealed; these go back well before the Neopalatial structure, and in this room was preserved a stratigraphic sequence spanning MM IA to MM IIIA.

Above was a thicker accumulation of fairly pure clayey soil, no doubt silted in, perhaps reflecting a period when the space was out of use; there is a join with the lower levels as well. The pottery here is MM IA, one of the few pockets of Prepalatial occupation in the whole of Block M. Pumice from this context was analysed and found to belong, in all probability, to the very early Theran BU eruption, c. 200,000 years ago (see Appendix, sample PKV 14). context 45.2 (#5426 (contaminated), 5429-30, 5438-39, 5432, 5434, 5436) (fig. 2.48: 5, 6) Above an ill-defined and sloping surface we find a deeper accumulation but with ceramics dating to MM IIB. At this point we do not have any architecture with which to associate the material. There are definite differences from the substantial fills from the E side of Block M that we have assigned to MM IIA: there are no offset bases, almost no tall flaring tumblers, little polychrome, only one or two pieces of amphora with dark-on-light and white piping, and a rarity of parallel striations. A further striking difference is that straight-sided cups are present here, while they are almost entirely absent from the MM IIA fills. Such a distinction would have little merit at Rnossos, for example, where straight-sided cups are present in both phases, albeit with some distinctions. At Palaikastro, however, the presence/absence of straight-sided cups could well be of temporal significance. CONTEXT 45.3 (#5419, 5422, 5423, 5425) (FIG. 2.48: 2, 3) This comprises a thin accumulation of very pure clayey soil lay between Context 45.2 and above that, a gradual accumulation of MM IIIA domestic pottery. It suggests that the room was room in full use in the MM IIIA period, a scenario that is repeated in many other parts of Block M. Subsequent occupation along much the same lines continued in MM IIIB. (Context 45.4 published in 2003.J85 Room 46 (fig. 2.49; plate 16 a) Entered from the N via the paved street (Room 53) and the vestibule Room 47, Room 46 is a large paved room of 4 m x 3.2 m. From Room 47, the visitor would have the choice of continuing on the ground floor into this open paved court (46) or ascending a staircase which rose to the s (over Room 43). The staircase preserves two slabs: the top one is c. 1 m long and 7 cm thick, the bottom is 80 cm long and 13 cm thick. The rise from the floor is 28 cm, from the first to the second slab 22 cm. The rest of the stairs were likely in wood.86 At the w of the vestibule there is a threshold with a dooijamb base on either end but no traces of walls, as they of course lack the wooden framing that would have provided the structural support for the walls and doorway. The threshold and bases project 6 cm above the floor. The room is paved with good sideropetra slabs, some with sawn rounded corners. At the N, Wall 450 has a circular cutting, perhaps for a jar or an inset column. There are several drains; one runs along 450 to the w; one runs under 450 at the ne and one runs outside the E wall 406. The wall visible at the w is LM III; no earlier line was found but it was likely close to this one. CONTEXT 46.1: PAVED COURTYARD (#5400, 5404, 5435, 5437, 6464-66, 6463) Pottery scatter on the slabs assignable to MM IIIB was identified. This is probably earthquake debris, one or two pieces possibly later, but are close enough to other disturbed contexts not to be surprising if so. Room 45 seemed to have been dug out and then filled back in with the same material,87 and such an operation might have affected the material on the slabs as well. CONTEXT 46.2 (#5395-97&gt; 5427-28, 5398-99, 5421, 5424) Despite 'modern' contamination in this context, with one rim sherd that has a brown-yellow glaze at the interior, the remaining 1 1/2 tables of pottery already seem to belong to MM IIIB, which predominates in lower levels (Context 46.1). Room 47 (fig. 2.49; plate 16 a) Reached from the paved street (Room 53) this is a small vestibule containing a slab threshold into this part of the building. It led either s to a staircase or w to the paved Room 46 (see above). The N 85 PKND. 86 Shaw 2009, 95. PKND,</page><page sequence="101">BLOCK M ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY Fig. 2.49. Plan of Rooms 46 and 47. 411 and w 902 walls are well built of mostly small stones with a larger boulder at the corner and a vertical slab at the s end of the N-s projection where the wooden doorframe would have been fitted. The threshold slab is c. 130 x 30 cm. The walls forming this space are rebuilt over the earlier line of 450 but against the contemporaneous 4og. This area shows an extensive use of wood, as also found in the Southeast Building. There were no contexts from this Room. Rooms 48, 49, 50 (fig. 2.50) The walls visible on the plan belong to early structures; a large LM IA robbing pit, filled in with debris and tephra cut into these earlier remains from a predecessor to the MM III Northwest Building and removed the MM III levels. The pit cut partly through a hard surface at lo.oot (Context 50.3) at a similar height as the paving slabs in Room 53 (10.05-10.10T); this then was probably the continuation of the MM III street, which may have extended much further s to where the alley (Room 36) leads w to Rooms 37-38 and even through Rooms 20 and 19 to join Main Street. Along the w side of this MM III street, next to Wall 406, was a drain; it was full of MM III pottery and is listed below as Context 49.1. Below the MM III street level were earlier remains; the space was divided by Wall 428 (top at 9.90?) with Room 48 to the N of this wall and Rooms 49/50 to the s. Wall 428 ran under the drain at the w, (as did all of the earlier plaster floors) giving them a terminus ante quem of MM IIIA. Rooms 49/50 were excavated as one room; only at the very lowest excavated levels was Wall 451 (top at 9.70?) revealed, and these earlier contexts are all listed as Room 50. These early walls were each small, 25 cm wide rubble walls with medium size stones but no proper faces. Deposits in Room 50 go back to MM IB and may relate to other early architecture in Rooms 13, 18, 16, 9a, 45, and 64. Crucially, at c. 9-70-9.75! throughout the area was a red and orange plaster floor, much like the one found in Room ga in the trial below the stoa paving (Context ga.i). This was well preserved to the N of Wall 428 in Room 48 but patchy to the s of 428. It was not clear if the floor continued under or went with Wall 428, though the latter seems more likely. Although MM IIB pottery was found on and above the plaster floor in Room 48 (see Context 48.1, below), in Rooms 4g/50 the pottery was earlier — MM IB. It might be that the original orange/red plaster floor (it seemed possible that the orange patches were a kind of decoration; otherwise a patching job in a slightly different shade) was indeed MM I and that when Wall 428 was constructed the N part of the floor remained in use in MM IIA until being filled in during the MM IIB construction phase; this part of the floor showed the most</page><page sequence="102">PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN Fig. 2.50. Plan of Rooms 48 evidence for upkeep. Wall 451 was very poorly preserved and at such a low height it is difficult to link it to anything, but it may originally have gone with the plaster floor level in Rooms 49/50. CONTEXT 48.1 (#5373-8o) This is a small room defined by Walls 466 to the N, 432 to the E, and 428 to the s; there may have been a doorway to the w. Here lying on a reddish orange plaster floor at 9.70T was a deposit of MM IIB pottery (and note the similarity of the floor to that found below the later stoa in Room 9a). CONTEXT 48.2: LM IA PIT WITH TEPHRA (#5348-50, 5352, 5357-59) This is a pit with LM IA pottery, a join with Context 49.2 and Theran tephra (see Appendix, sample PKV 15); at the top is some possible LM IB contamination, with fragments of ogival cups. CONTEXT 49.1 (#5381-84) The drain running along the w next to Wall 406 must have served the robbed-out street level. The contents of the drain were arguably MM IIIA in date, which corresponds with the picture found elsewhere in the Block, where we have evidence for MM IIIA drain construction and use in Rooms 12, 54 and perhaps 64. CONTEXT 49.2 (#5351-54) The LM IA pit also covered this room. The upper levels here consist of about two tables of pottery with excellent diagnostic LM IA material. CONTEXT 50.1: ACCUMULATION ABOVE RED-ORANGE PLASTER FLOOR (#5390-91, 5393) This context preserves material just above the patchy red-orange plaster floor level. The pottery here is not later than MM IB and may represent accumulation during the use of the floor. These levels</page><page sequence="103">BLOCK M ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY 73 seem to pre-date Wall 428, which divides Rooms 49/50 from Room 48; Context 50.2 may indicate the construction date for that wall. CONTEXT 5O.2: BELOW LATER PIT (#5386-89, 5393) Below the pit was a jumble of broken up plaster coming down onto a hard surface of whitish soil; perhaps some wall collapse or even preparation for a later floor. Sealed below this, and above Context 50.1 we find a continued accumulation amid sandy soil, but with pottery of MM II date, perhaps connected with the construction of Wall 428. On the N side of 428 in Room 48 the pottery on the red-orange plaster floor was also MM II; here to the s the floor may have gone out of use with the building of that wall. CONTEXT 50.3: LM IA PIT (#5360, 5362-63, 5365-67, 5370) This includes clear LM IA material, though relatively few decorated pieces, and of course much earlier material. Room 51 (fig. 2.50) Separated from Room 52 by Wall 466 at the N and Wall 461 at the E, this small compartment was only partly investigated. LM IA levels (but no floors) higher up gave way to mixed pottery of MM II III date. No contexts were selected from here. Room 52 (fig. 2.51) This long rectangular space was bordered at the N by the LM IB Wall 402, which was built over the earlier North Fa9ade for much of its length. Prior to LM IB however, this was not a continuous stretch of wall, with large openings at Room 53 and perhaps here as well. At least parts of this space seem to have been external. There was a gradual accumulation of debris until early in LM IB when Wall 402 was rebuilt and material dumped, either as fill or disposal, just inside it; an operation which must have taken place shortly after the eruption of Thera. This provides us with a useful window into this immediately post-Theran eruption horizon, although there may well have been a gap in occupation of some years following the destruction. context 52.I (#4275-80) This yielded MM IIB and some MM IIIA, as elsewhere across the Northwest Building. Fig. 2.51. Plan of Room 52.</page><page sequence="104">74 PAL AI K ASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN CONTEXT 52.2 (#4271-74) This is above the MM IIB levels of Room 52; in the w near Room 51 material includes clear MM IIIA types. In the E of the Room we find also MM IIIA pottery (not MM II as mentioned in the preliminary report)88 bounded by Walls 402 (n Façade) and 410 to the E. context 52.3 (#4256-70) Above the MM IIIA levels of context 52.2, some MM IIIA continues but alongside predominantly LM IA pottery, though a clear LM IA stratum is impossible to identify. Immediately higher up LM IA is found mixed with LM IB pottery, with large quantities of material (approximately seven 1 x 2 m tables). This is early LM IB debris, associated with the construction of North Façade 402. It is probable that some LM IA material was dumped and other disturbed by the major rebuilding of Wall 402 so unfortunately this context does not help us draw clear ceramic distinctions between late LM IA pottery and early LM IB; as both are certainly present. The best possible indicators are bell cups that look like precursors of the LM IB ogival cup but without a strongly everted rim, which start to appear here, and the occurrence of 'spray-painted' ware — burnished and splatter painted jugs in a fine orange fabric that are a common local style in LM IB. Room 53 (figs. 2.52-2.53) Room 53 was originally a paved street coming s from Street M-5. The North Façade Wall 402 was rebuilt (blocking this passage) in LM IB but at the lowest courses the opening can be seen from the street to the n. This paved street must have continued to the s where at Room 47 we find an entrance system for the Northwest Building; unfortunately if there was road paving further s from there (over Rooms 48-50) it was robbed and the surface cut by LM IA pits. We pick the street up again at Room 36, an alley to the w and it probably continued through Room 20 and on to Main Street at the s. Here in Room 53, Wall 40g at the w is 55 cm wide with some wedge-shaped stones and much tightly packed rubble; there was a well-built drain along its continuation further to the s (Wall 406, see Context 49.1). Wall 40g is built up against Wall 411 but runs under 402. At the E, Wall 416 and its return to the se 425 have good faces only at the exterior (i.e. in the street/Room 53) and serve only to define the street area with perhaps an empty space to the E closed when the North Façade was rebuilt in LM IB.89 Wall 416, like Wall 40g and the paving slabs, runs under the North Façade 402. context 53.1 (#336g-74) (fig. 2.53: 6) This comprises material on the purple schist street paving, stratified below a layer of LM IA pottery and Theran tephra; however, while the ceramics on the slabs seemed no later than MM HIB, there was tephra (see Appendix, sample PKV 21/1) inside a tripod pot that was fallen on the slabs. The pot was upside down, resting at an angle and the lens of tephra had settled inside the pot level to the ground, so it had filled in the pot after the pot was already lying in the street; also it must have been transported by water. Here we have some MM IIIB refuse dumped after the earthquake in a street that was no longer used, where it sat until being inundated by the LM IA Theran eruption flooding event; most of the tephra and LM IA pottery settled above but in places, such as this large jar that projected some 21 cm above the slabs, the tephra was washed in. We know that there was limited reuse of the Southeast Building after this destruction and here we find that along this MM III internal alley (comprising Rooms 53, 48-50, and 36, leading to the small house at Rooms 37-8 and continuing s through Rooms 20 and ig) we also find MM IIIB material either preserved in situ (as here and Rooms 36-8) or dumped (as Rooms 20 and ig) or evidence for LM IA pits (as Rooms 48-50) suggesting that this street may also have gone out of use — as did the wine-making installation at Rooms 41-42.) CONTEXT 53.2: LM IA WITH THERAN ASH (#3362-63, 3366, 3368) (FIG. 2.53: 4, 5) This is LM IA wash layer including Theran tephra (see Appendix, sample PKV 17), much pottery with decorated fine ware sherds and bone; such wash layers occur in other streets, as in Context StrBM.3. This is below the LM IB accumulation/dump that spans Rooms 54 and 53 (Context 54.2). 88 PK 1990, 133-4; note the three figurines shown in fig. 10. 89 The good MM III-LM IA street wall stops just NW of Room 65; there may have been open space or some structures in the area of Room 52.</page><page sequence="105">BLOCK M ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY Fig. 2.52.

In this area, E of 469, the LM III contamination was limited or absent and the upper levels consist primarily of LM IB debris discarded during the rebuilding which followed the Theran eruption. The earliest material comes from a small, well-built drain running through Wall 411, draining the paved Room 46. CONTEXT 54.1 (#3375~8 1) (fig. 2.56: 9, 11) The earliest material here, directly below the LM IB levels of Context 54.2, is MM IIIB. Note the contrast with Room 53, where there is some LM IA with ash stratified between the MM IIIB and LM IB levels. A fair amount of the material joins up, yet it is not a primary in situ deposit.

Plan of Rooms 55 and Rooms 55-63 (figs. 2.55-2.56; also plan 2: section A) These relate to the LM IIIA2 occupation of Building 4 to the N. Rooms 61, 62 and 63 formed actual annexes to Building 4 and the remaining spaces, Rooms 55-60, seem to have been used for rubbish disposal. There were no occupation levels or floor deposits from this area, nor did we find evidence of the late LM IIIA2/early LM IIIB earthquake and subsequent abandonment that was responsible for the latest deposits in Buildings 4, 5, 7, from the new excavations or Blocks A, T and n from the old. Rather the deposits show material withdrawn from use over time during the course of PK Period XV. The major interest in this area of course is the deposit of metallurgical debris, published by Hemingway in 1996;91 his catalogue and interpretations of the material remain as published and need not be reconsidered.92 What does need clarification is the context of the metallurgical debris, as succinctly pointed out by Catling in his rebuttal.93 We hope to rectify the matter here; the context listings and pottery catalogue are to be found in Chapter 7. The metallurgical debris consisted of fragments from tuyeres, crucibles and moulds. The debris was found in an area (fig. 2.55) cut by three distinct pits. First, a roughly circular pit stops just short of Wall 516 to the w and continues through the s edge of the EP88 N baulk (Context 55.5). At the s the pit is cut by a robbing trench on Wall 450; and at the E by a foundation trench for Wall 469 (Context 91 Hemingway 1996. 92 Including his proposal that a rod tripod stand was among the objects cast.

All fragments of metallurgical debris (and no new fragments came to light during further study) were confined to the area N of the robbing trench on 450 but were found both in the foundation trench for 469 and outside it to the w in the larger pit. In the foundation trench the metallurgical debris came from between 10.24T and 10.1 it; outside it from 10.24? to 10.10?. The debris was slightly more concentrated outside the foundation trench than in. In all, approximately 1750 sherds were recovered from zembils containing metallurgical debris; of these some 150 fragments were metallurgical, or roughly 8-io°/o.94 The larger pit was roughly circular and gradually sloping at the edges to the N and w. Both the larger pit and the foundation trench became clear at the same height — 10.27? to 1 0.31 ?; and both ended at 10.03?; but the foundation trench was full of large stones at that height. The robbing pit on Wall 450 was completely full of stones up to 10.56? and first taken as a wall; two fragments from tuyeres were recovered from the edge of this pit at 10.24? an^ 10.12?. e of Wall 469 there is no LM III pottery below topsoil (see Contexts 54.1 and 54.2, fig. 2.56: 7, 8, 9), and no metallurgical debris. All of the metallurgical debris likely belongs together and could easily result from a single casting event.95 Hemingway reconstructs a very large tripod stand, cauldron, six double axes, several sickles and some bars or blanks. Most of the mould fragments are missing, but that is not unusual.96 Hemingway also suggests that the debris could come from an itinerant metal smith, an idea supported by the tuyeres all of which are of a type ('diverted') known best from Israel (where they are associated with Cypriot pottery) and Egypt.97 While Hemingway preferred to see a local workshop, further excavation and research on the site rather supports the idea of this material resulting from an itinerant performing a one-time commission. The pottery from the layers above the pits was typical worn topsoil material. There was no distinction in date or ceramic composition between the various pits save the robbing pit on 450 which was full of stones and had very few potsherds; all of this ceramic material from these pits was extremely fresh and stood out from the topsoil material immediately. There was not a single fragment demonstrably later than our Period XV; indeed the material seemed if anything distinctly earlier than the final 94 Not every zembil or basket of pottery from the larger pit yielded metallurgical debris; the total of sherds from the entire pit would be 2250 and percentages of 5-7%. 95 Hemingway 1996, 243. 96 MUM, 220; only a single mould for a small billet was recovered from the workshop debris; clay moulds would obviously be scarce, being broken after use. 97 Hemingway 1996, 220 n. 11; 242.</page><page sequence="109">BLOCK M ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY Fig. 2.57. Plan of Rooms 58-63. Period XV (LM IIIA2) deposits known from the site and it was stratified over material from Period XIV (LM IIIA1-2 early). At this time Block M was essentially an empty lot, used for rubbish disposal and so would be entirely appropriate for the scale of the metal casting implied by the metallurgical debris. Period XV is one of the largest and possibly richest periods at the site so it would also make sense for such a valuable object to be commissioned at this time. The site is abandoned after an earthquake at the end of the period; some time later, in roughly mid-LM IIIB, settlers gradually return, taking up residence along Kouremenos to the N and the hilltop of Kastri; Building 1 is reoccupied or reused for a limited time as perhaps is Building 3; there are a few scattered deposits of material from the old excavation as well, but until close to the beginning of LM IIIC, when the new settlement on Kastri takes hold, there is little to no occupation at the site and certainly no town as such. The LM IIIB deposits are easily recognisable by the presence of deep bowls, unknown from Period XV, and by the (possibly total) dominance of non-local fabrics. No such material was recovered from even the topsoil layers in the area of the metallurgical debris. The LM IIIC pottery from Kastri, meanwhile, is so distinctive that Popham was certain that an entirely new element had taken up residence.98 No pottery of this date was evident either. Obviously the metallurgical debris must pre-date the foundation trench for Wall 469 and by extension the robbing pit for Wall 450 (or at least belong to the same operation). Since no LM IIIB or later material was recovered during the removal of Wall 469, even this wall robbing/construction would be best assigned to some time late in LM IIIA2, giving that as a terminus ante quern for the metallurgical debris. As far as dating the material archaeologically and placing it into the site history are concerned there is no problem. Unfortunately, such an early date for the objects Hemingway reconstructs is not currently acceptable. Having reviewed his identification of a rod tripod stand from the mould fragments we agree that not only is such an identification possible, it remains the most likely interpretation." With such a quandary we must withdraw our dating of the material until such a time as it may merit 98 Having had the chance to examine some material from Kastri in the Stratigraphical Museum in the course of preparing the reoccupation of Building 1 for publication, I (TFC) agree with his assessment. 99 This assessment was also seconded by H. Matthaus who was able to examine the material in person.</page><page sequence="110">8o PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: the PROTO- and NEOPALATIAL TOWN reassessment. It is hoped that by a full presentation of the context and arguments here that excavators and scholars will keep an open mind with regards to the date of such material, as it is highly unlikely that such metalwork began at Palaikastro or even on Crete. We fully expect other evidence of early metalworking in this style to come to light on Cyprus and indeed in the Aegean, if we are correct in our supposition of itinerant craftsmen.

Northwest Building: Summary The Northwest Building is structurally distinct from its neighbours, separated by an alley from both. Chronologically it overlaps with the Southeast Building at least during MM III. Insofar as it also has a paved court (Room 46) and its own large supply of drinking and pouring vessels in a small closet, it functionally replicates some aspects of the Southeast Building. With the wine-making installation on the ground floor and the massive staircase, we can assume that any living areas were on an upper storey. If, as has been posited, these town blocks at Palaikastro were inhabited by some kind of extra familial group (whether 'clans', 'factions' or 'houses') what are we to make of the division between the Northwest and Southeast Buildings in Block M during MM IIIB? They would seem on the surface to represent a subdivision by family group. We might argue that the Southeast Building was a special</page><page sequence="112">82 PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN purpose building; that it served the same extended group in some ceremonial way which involved public participation and was hence segregated by the alley. The distinctly Knossian or central Cretan character of the Southeast Building, not found in the Northwest, might rather suggest a subdivided block that was not bound together as a single social unit. Rooms 37 and 38 are interesting to consider in this light as they are both attached to and yet separated from the Northwest Building proper. It is possible that there was an entrance to the e into Room 40 (which seemed to be a kitchen) from Room 38; otherwise these rooms were only accessed from the alleyway around the corner from the entrance to the complex of Rooms 39-47, despite sharing a wall. Was this small two-room suite with a separate entrance and possible connection to the kitchen used by a different family, kin group or clan from the main unit (Rooms 39-47)? Or were they attached in some way, but kept at a distance? In any case, while the Southeast Building shows some political characteristics and the Southwest some religious, the Northwest Building seems resoundingly domestic. ARCHITECTURAL ANALYSIS BY CHRONOLOGICAL PERIOD Building phases may not align perfectly with ceramic chronology and with the earliest remains precise dating of the architecture is not possible, owing to a lack of clearly preserved floors etc. Hence a wide date range is given. We have no architectural remains in Block M earlier than EM III. Building Phase 1: EM III-MM IIA (fig. 2.61) This phase lumps together all of our earliest evidence for architecture; scattered walls and floors from across the Block associated with ceramics in some cases going back to EM III and pre-dating the major episode of construction that occurs after MM IIA. WALLS Two small Walls, 624 and 625, in Room 64 are associated with EM III pottery and a patch of floor at 9.75T; two obsidian blades come from here. Like other walls preserved from this phase, such as in Rooms 17 (632 and 631) and 64 (619), they are small, probably internal, and utilise more earth than stone, much of it clay, and are bound by thick yellowish clay and mud plaster. Other walls are similar to the MM III style of rubble masonry and may belong later in this phase. There is not enough extant architecture from this phase to tell if wood was employed as extensively as in the subsequent period; but perhaps not as there were no chases in the clay-bound walls in Rooms 17 and 64 where they should have been obvious had they existed. FLOORS The earliest floors in Rooms 17 and 64 are of well-beaten yellowish clay; the reddish orange plaster floors in Rooms 48/49/50 seem to belong to MM IB with MM II debris above; this plaster was applied directly to the dirt below with numerous re-layings. Perhaps somewhat later, in MM IIA, there was a very fine floor, of a hard orange plaster found in a sounding below the central court (Room ga). Here was also an odd bit of construction: a narrow partition that created two small cists, one floored with some schist paving with plastered interstices and one floored simply in plaster, as the floor mentioned above to the E of the partition in the same sounding. From such meagre evidence it is hard to draw conclusions, though a progression can be seen from the yellow clay (MM IA) to the poorly applied plaster (MM IB) to the fine hard polished plaster in MM IIA. Whether or not this progression is an accident of preservation and investigation or whether it reflects any trends in construction applicable more broadly across the site remains to be seen. SPATIAL ORGANISATION Little can be said for this early period. The fine plaster floor located below the central court of the Southeast Building may indicate some continuity in locating the finer or more important areas of the building, but we have no obvious facades, doorways or even complete rooms from this phase. Building Phase 2: MM IIB-IIIB (fig. 2.62) A major, town-wide episode of construction took place sometime after MM IIA. Main Street was created at this time and in the Southeast Building of Block M a series of dense fills enclosed by simple rubble walls set on or close to bedrock raised and shored up the entire se quadrant of the building. It</page><page sequence="113">BLOCK M ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY Fig. 2.61. Plan of architectural remains, EM III-MM IIA. was at this time, coincident with the construction of the Southeast Building (and presumably the Northwest as well), that Palaikastro took on its urban character. After a destruction with some burning at the end of MM IIIA, both buildings were rebuilt or perhaps just restored along very similar lines; a few walls were added, new floors in some rooms, and the large slab paving in Room gb may have been installed. A major earthquake brought down both buildings at the end of this phase; neither was ever fully rebuilt. WALLS External or façade walls are either massively built of medium to large boulders (as at the North Façade of the Southeast Building) or, we think, of ashlar sandstone masonry (as at the East and South Façades of the Southeast Building). Internal walls are generally of a smallish stone rubble with little or</page><page sequence="114">PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN Fig. 2.62. Plan of architectural remains, MM IIB-MM IIIB.</page><page sequence="115">BLOCK M ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY 85 no proper coursing and visible chases or gaps indicating the intensive use of wood (also employed in this phase for floors, ceilings, staircases, and doors). The static requirements are fulfilled by a wooden structure set around or even filled in by earth and stone rubble which is then held in by mud plaster and often decorated with painted lime plaster. Some of the earlier walls in the Southeast Building, such as 634 and 662 (fig. 2.8; plate 2.5) are more carefully and regularly built especially in the lower courses. There were no fragments of mud bricks recovered from this phase, despite the presence of burned destruction material in several contexts and while various earth mixtures and mud plasters were common and recovered, there does not seem to have been any use of mould-made mud bricks at all. The use of wood increases throughout this phase; Wall 661 for example is added in MM IIIB. FLOORS The early floors include a mosaiko paving of red schist with fine white plaster interstices in Room 8, red and green schist 'crazy paving' in Room 3, a massive sideropetra slab paving in the colonnade and hard beaten earth or white plaster in the basement rooms (4, 6, 7) and ground floor (1, 2). White plaster laid over or, more likely, including murex shells as a filler was used in the maceration tank in the wine-making installation and also in the narrow Room 12, which may also have had some industrial function. Most of these floors were simply kept up through MM III, with only Room 8 being substantially remodelled in MM IIIB. There, much of the rubble was left, a narrow support wall built and a new floor, supported by a wooden frame put in some 30-40 cm higher than the original. The bent access stairs leading down into this room were also replaced. Also possibly added in MM IIIB are the large rectangular slabs in Room 9b as these seemed to have been cut to fit around pre-existing columns and were some 10-15 cm higher than the sideropetra slabs; of course it is possible they were part of the original layout of the area as paving stones cut to fit columns are common enough.100 STAIRS The entrance vestibule for the Northwest Building (Room 47) led to a wide staircase rising to the s over Room 43, turning e and then N over Rooms 44 and 45. Only the first two steps were in stone, the rest presumably wooden. In the Southeast Building stone steps rising up out of Room 7 may have continued over the length of Room 6, turning and rising to the second storey; alternatively, they may have simply served a mezzanine level floor in Room 6 (which had a sunken ground floor). The sideropetra slabs in the entrance to Room 8 may have been from a staircase rising from the court to the w, turning s around Room 7; Room 8 would then only be accessibly from Room 7, which could only be reached from a higher floor — but this seems a rather tortuous circulation pattern. We expect there was also a staircase at the E, either over Rooms 10 and 11 or Room 12, above the drain, but no slabs were found. DRAINS Most of the drainage of the building and streets belongs to the beginning of this period and must have been the first thing to be laid out. There were several carefully-built stone drains; smaller drains though less impressive are still well made. With the silting and flooding we find in Room 6 and the emphasis on drainage in this period we can infer a period of much wetter weather than came after. The main drain for the court (Room 9) had silted or was filled in after MM IIIA and a terracotta drain channel was put in, carefully propped up on stones (and one inverted ledge-rim bowl). Given that these drains usually fit together in a series and that the one complete specimen came from the unrobbed portion of the drain, we expect that the entire length of the channel was so lined during the MM IIIB restoration of the building. The other nearby drain in Room 10 was left to silt in and unused after MM IIB/IIIA. OTHER The preserved portion of column from Room 9 turned out to be constructed of an unlikely mixture of sharp stones of uneven size, and dirt, shaped and plastered. Only 10 cm was preserved but there was no sign of wood or even a void where it could have been; and there seems little reason to put an intervening layer of such random rubble between the prepared base and a proper wooden column. Similar rubble was found behind some fallen shaped plaster from a wall or bench in Room 7. 100 Shaw 2009, 82.</page><page sequence="116">86 PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN SPATIAL ORGANISATION The entire Block was reconfigured, and therefore rethought, during this construction episode in MM IIB. New structures on different alignments were in some cases built over earlier rooms — the clearest example of this is the street or alley put through the middle of the block from Room 53, over Rooms 48/49/50 (with a drain alongside) and down through Rooms 20 and 19. To change what had been enclosed rooms with plaster floors to a street requires a complete reconsideration of spatial allocation and differential access. We have no indications of what may have happened at the end of MM IIA to create the opportunity for this kind of ground up reconstruction; if, for example there was some destructive event to produce the masses of ceramic material deposited in the fills, as seems likely. What we do see is the civic political will to create essentially a new town along planned lines. Most of the SE quarter of the Southeast Building was cleared down to nearly sterile soil; and two seemingly independent structures are created in the Block,101 with significant differences in spatial organisation. The Southeast Building is organised around a central court on the ground floor with a 'reception' room off one side. There are sunken rooms to the w (Rooms 7 and 8), the larger of which (8) was given a very fine paved floor and whether it served a domestic or ritual purpose (or some combination) it was certainly not industrial. Rooms 4, 5, and 6 no doubt had a staircase and perhaps an entrance off Main Street; there seem to have been cups stored in Room 6 at least;102 another possible entry point off the wide plateia/street B-M at the E of the Building (Rooms 10 and 11) also had a pantry/ closet with cups and probably a staircase over Room 12. Rooms 1 and 2 are enigmatic, but seem to be living, rather than working spaces. The only plausible area for industrial activity is the narrow space in Room 12b; indeed virtually all of the ground floor could be used for regular domestic or communal activities rather than the kitchen, workshop, storage and other industrial uses often found on ground floors in Minoan buildings. Indeed, the building seems to lack storage space or vessels (hardly any pithos sherds were recovered from any part of the Southeast Building). It is tempting to see this ground floor space as more for ceremonial purpose, and perhaps on an intermittent or infrequent basis such as would not require permanent storage or regular supplies of resources. If there were truly two entrances, both associated with staircases, what would this indicate about the occupants of the upper storeys? Might we be looking at two residential groups sharing or looking after an essentially ceremonial ground floor? Or perhaps the upper storeys here were not domestic either, but rather balconies looking over the court? Room 13 to the N of the court is also puzzling. It had the same gravel and plaster surface as the court, at roughly the same absolute height, and though separated by the L-shaped Wall 577 seems to be open to the court. This large open area as mentioned showed a similar plaster surface over the same kind of sherd and stone fill as found in Room ga and may, in fact, have been open, empty space, a second court. In contrast, the chronologically overlapping Northwest Building shows an entrance system leading to a smaller paved court (at Room 46) with a pantry of drinking vessels (45) and a massive stairway (over Rooms 43 and 44); but the other ground floor rooms, 39, 40, 41 and 42 show exactly the kind of industrial (wine-making in 41/42), kitchen (in Room 40) and workshop/storage (the unfloored under-stair compartment Room 43 with building debris, plaster and tools) that one often finds on the ground floor of a Minoan house. The entryway at Room 47 shows exactly the typical vestibule with choice of stairway or interior as found in later buildings on the site (House N, Block B 1-22 etc.).103 Rooms 37 and 38, attached at the S of the Northwest Building but reached via an alley connecting (through Room 36) to the main N-s alley, are very interesting. We have two clearly inhabited buildings in the Block in this phase; these rooms are not part of either. Were the inhabitants of this small two room structure related by kin to one or both of the other buildings? Were they attached to the households in some kind of service? The latter seems more likely given the size of the houses (which would surely have room for even very large or extended family) but it is odd then that there was not more direct access into one or the other of the buildings; unless the whole block really was a single landholding; but then why the bisecting alley? Given that they took the trouble to create such an alley where one had not existed previously (over what had been properly roofed and plastered rooms), thereby separating the Northwest and Southeast Buildings, we might question the prevailing opinions about these town blocks at Palaikastro belonging to supra-familial groups — whether clans, or factions or 'houses'.104 101 There may have been a precursor to the Southwest Building but evidence was too scanty to be sure; what is visible on the plan is certainly later. 102 Rupp and Tsipopoulou 1999; Macdonald and Knappett 2007. 103 Cunningham 2001. 104 PK Settlement, Cunningham 2001; Driessen 2010a.</page><page sequence="117">BLOCK M ARCHITECTURE AND STRATIGRAPHY 8? Building Phase 3: LM IA (fig. 2.63) We have a very clear picture of what was happening at the end of this period, leading up to and including the Theran eruption. The earlier part of the period is less certain and whether, in some cases, some rooms were refurbished or reused prior to the widespread dismantling at the end of the period is unsure, at least in the Southeast Building. In the Northwest Building the only sign of LM IA activity was a robbing pit over Rooms 48-50. There may have been some attempt at cleaning (material from the pantry in Room 45 was disturbed somewhat) but MM IIIB earthquake debris was left, for example in Room 46 (the paved courtyard), the wine-making installation was never reused or even disturbed, and the debris in the kitchen in Room 40 was untouched. There is, consequently, no LM IA architecture from the Northwest Building. The Southeast Building presents a more complicated history. Deposits with LM IA pottery fall into several categories. In Rooms 1,2, and 3 we find one or two inverted LM IA conical cups on the floors, showing that the floors were exposed at the time. Whether these rooms were reused, or if the cups simply represent some kind of propitiatory offering, is unsure. Deposits with cooking pots, sometimes strainer jugs, and cups atop collapsed debris associated with Theran tephra occur in Rooms 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 11. These contexts are similar, usually one or two fragmentary cooking vessels, cups, some large coarseware fragments as could be used to fashion a small cooking fire; never on a proper floor, just using the top of earlier debris as a surface. Rooms 4, 5, and 6 cannot have been fully roofed as tephra was found in each, amidst and over the pots and cups. Contexts with robbing pits occur in Rooms 8, 12a, 12b and 18; areas of the court (9) that show robbed out slabs but lack any clear pit dug from higher up (as Context ga.g for example) were probably also robbed out at this time. It is these deposits that have led us to term this a 'squatter' occupation; the multiple similar cooking deposits might suggest several families, living in greatly reduced circumstances, and perhaps engaged in stripping valuable building material (especially wood, but also paving stones) from the ruined building. There are a few contexts, in Rooms 4, 8, and 15 that seem to pre-date these 'squatter' deposits (in the case of Room 4, Contexts 4.4-4.5, one is stratified below the other) that show a combination of conical cups and baking plates and might point to some activity earlier in LM IA — though not necessarily of any different character to the later contexts. Finally, we have small deposits of broken-up material (including LM IA conical cups) amidst gravel and silt in the open areas of the building — what we have termed wash deposits (in Rooms 9 and 13). We believe these were caused by the flood event associated with the Theran eruption. It is most clearly witnessed in Street B-M, as well as the latest occupation horizons in Rooms 7, 8, and g. Alongside this we have deposits of uncleared material in Rooms 8 (MM IIIA and B), 6, 10 and 11 (MM IIIB); the cover slabs for the drains are robbed but the drains are not reused; part of Room 7 is cleared out though this may just relate to a deposit with a double strainer next to an LM IA pit in Room 6. The only new wall is the E extension of Wall 811 which may be rebuilt with a doorway to the w. As with LM IA walls in the Southwest Building, the construction of this foundation is more robust and regular than the earlier walls. The Southwest Building presents a very different story. A sounding in Room 22 revealed tumble and still showed some LM IA pottery, so while there may have been some earlier construction here, this building, with its odd, casemate construction and axial alignment seems to post-date our MM IIIB earthquake destruction. WALLS Wall 811 from the Southeast Building may be an LM IA construction; like the walls from the Southwest Building, it was more regularly constructed with more careful coursing and better faces than most of the earlier walling. Preserved tops of foundations seem to be more regular and even and present almost a platform-like appearance. This tendency is found in plan as well as individual wall construction; the small casemate rooms, like the plan of Block X 51-66 or Building 1 from the recent excavations utilise a kind of platform construction with deep and wide foundations below floor surface (and hence obscuring doorways and circulation routes). This type of construction is common in flood-plain mud brick architecture throughout the Near East and Egypt.105 Although true mud brick architecture is rarely found in Minoan Crete it may have served the same purpose; to raise the building as protection from flooding and to give greater stability to the superstructure — in this case the kind of wooden 105 Or see Possehl (2003, 101-2) for its use in the Indus Valley.</page><page sequence="118">PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN Fig. 2.63.

Wall 595 is worthy of special mention: massively constructed of coursed boulders this would seem to serve only a doorway into Room 32. FLOORS Only earth floors survive from this period in this Block. OTHER The tri-lobed sage fresco (10765) was found in a dump of MM IIIB pottery deposited just outside the Southeast Building after the MM IIIB earthquake. SPATIAL ORGANISATION Evidence for spatial organisation in LM IA is, of course, restricted here to the Southwest Building and Rooms 29-32, which are highly idiosyncratic and may not provide for any broader understanding of construction patterns during the period in question. Inside the Building proper we have the corner of what looks to be a large room (21) bordered to the n by two small rooms (22 and 23) and a paved vestibule (24) with axial doorways created by stub walls off the long nw-se Wall 591. The closest parallel for this arrangement is Rooms 40-47 from Block B.106 The addition of Wall 586 and the small casemate-like rooms 25-7 at the N remind one of Block X 51-66, especially the small rooms 58 61.107 The strongly-built stub walls and casemate construction must all have served to support some upper storey construction.108 The space between the Southwest and Northwest Buildings, Rooms 29 32, was created by these LM IA constructions and is also therefore an LM IA feature (Rooms 37 and 38 and Wall 590 in Room 32 along with the Northwest Building generally are MM III if not earlier). This space is axially aligned and consists of a large open area (Rooms 30 and 31) followed by two narrowing rooms (29 and 32) the latter of which is fronted by a massive doorway added at this time, as were the benches in Room 29. As discussed above this curious space seems designed for some kind of ritual or ceremonial use (with the open area and benches) and the alignment and restricted access into the paved room 32 suggests some cultic function. Whether this was related to the aquifer and cavern below the room has been obscured by Well 576, dug in LM IB. In any case, little can be said about domestic spatial organisation in this phase from these remains, idiosyncratic as they are. On the Impact of the Theran Eruption The eruption is very clearly marked in Block M by deposits of tephra (positively identified through the analyses reported in the Appendix). The amounts are not small, and the distribution is wide; conservatively 700-800 kg of this material was found from the far reaches of the Block; n in Room 53, w in Room 21, s in Rooms 6 and 4, and E in Room 12. It was also found in both Main Street and Street B-M. It was found stratified below LM IB and over LM IA. There is no reason for any confusion about the relative chronology of the eruption; it occurs at the end of the LM IA ceramic phase and long before the destructions at the end of the LM IB. The other feature of our eruption horizon deposits is the widespread evidence for flooding. That there was flooding is beyond question; the deposit in Street B-M, the washed-in tephra in an upside down jar in Room 53, and the micromorphology sample from the large pit above the drain in Room 12 confirm this. What we cannot say definitively at this time is whether the flooding was the result of heavy rains (associated with the eruption) or a tsunami, or even some combination of both. The case for a tsunami has been made elsewhere,109 and analysis is ongoing. We can point out that whatever the cause, the impact on this building, though significant, was not catastrophic. The flooding in Street B-M (which runs uphill, rather than across, as Main Street) was much worse than that in Main Street,110 but while there was some undercutting of walls and the enclosed drain shifted by some 30 or 40 cm, the effects seem consistent with a water depth of anywhere from 20 cm to 1 m — not enough to sweep away a building, at least not here, at a current height of roughly x 1 m above sea level and some 300 m from the shore.111 The signs of flooding from within the Block are either confined to pits 106 PKII, 289, pi. 6. I0' PKIV, 278. 108 The other notable use of projecting stub walls in the Block is from Rooms 44 and 45 in the Northwest Building where they supported a broad stairway. 109 Bruins et al. 2008. 110 See PK i996. 111 This is speculation based on personal observation of modern rain induced flooding in the area and to be taken only as such.</page><page sequence="120">PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN ..J -. &lt;•! ^ , -• 't^—. &lt;d %'\ cipis VS'S Sf -r' ■ r\ _ i-L.r "s 1' Cf]p,JiAl '^^11? a \ ■ JJk first w1 Fig. 2.64.

However, one must bear in mind that a tsunami could result from a variety of causes connected with such a massive cataclysm. Earlier or later sub-sea earthquakes, landslides, etc. could cause such effects and they need not even have originated from Thera itself. The only plausible hypothesis for a tsunami large enough to effectively erase buildings from the site requires that it happened well before the deposition of the tephra. This tephra was in some cases washed into fragile containers (such as the inverted pot in Context 53.1) that were in situ before the tephra was washed in and remained thereafter; a delicate operation. An earlier tsunami could be credited with creating the debris that later washed down the streets and left the building open to the elements; the specific (and smaller) flood that deposited the tephra, and for which we see clear evidence, could have come somewhat later. Building Phase 4: LM IB (fig. 2.64) There is of course little to be said about this period from this part of the site that has not already been said in the PK Wells volume. After the cataclysm at the end of LM IA, this entire block is sealed off by new and rebuilt walls. At the N, this closes off previously open areas and at least one alleyway, changing the layout of the town. At the E, Wall 707 follows a curving course as if delineating unbuilt space and it has the character of a terrace wall, lacking an inner face and of piecemeal construction. The two wells, 576 and 605, seem to be the only other new construction in the area. The dating evidence for the construction of the N perimeter wall at least suggests that, although it happened soon after the eruption, we are already recognisably in a new ceramic phase, with early versions of the ogival cup and spray-painted jugs appearing. There may have been some short period of at least partial abandonment and, considering broader developments at the site, with a flurry of new building, liberal use of ashlar masonry and some distinctive cult practices,112 a new cultural and possibly political orientation as well. Building Phase 5: LM III (fig. 2.65) Although Rooms 61, 62 and 63 are built at this time, they are better discussed with Building 4 in that publication; in any case they are simply built with scavenged materials. The major construction in this period in Block M is the massive n-s terrace or street Walls 569 and 525. These are built of rubble, varying from the massive (70 x 80 x 50 cm) boulders at the N to small scraps of burnt brick and ceramic with everything in between. They seem to define a roadway leading from Buildings 4, 5 and 7 (all active in LM IIIA2; PK Period XV) to Block D (likewise). Otherwise this continues to be an open area. 112 Cunningham 2001; PK Kouros.</page><page sequence="123">Chapter 3 Block M pottery typology The catalogue entries for the pottery are grouped according to context, divided into EM II-MM II, MM III and LM IA in Chapters 4, 5 and 6 respectively. With so many contexts to discuss (176), and considering their importance in piecing together the history of the Block, we consider this a necessary process methodologically. And while there is some overall discussion of the ceramic characteristics of each period in individual chapters, they risk losing an overall sense of the characteristics of Palaikastro pottery over the time span in question. Thus in this chapter we discuss the fabrics, wares, types and styles, charting continuity and change over the period between MM IA and LM IA, covering some four centuries. In some ways this endeavour mimics the recent example of the Knossos Pottery Handbook, in which pottery groups for the entire Neolithic and Bronze Age sequence are used to define each ceramic phase at the site.1 The identification of pottery groups as the basis for ceramic phasing, rather than pulling out features from various deposits to create a horizon (cf. Phaistos, Levi and Carinci 1988), is a deceptively simple step, yet crucial in establishing a sound methodological basis for phasing that can be subjected to explicit scrutiny. It follows up on the same methodology seen in a paper by Cadogan et al. (1993), in what may be seen now as a kind of dummy run for the Knossos Pottery Handbook. The equivalent periods at Knossos to those with which we are concerned in this volume are covered in three separate chapters.2 Clearly the mass of evidence from Knossos that has accumulated over the years, the volume of scholarly discussion, and indeed the pivotal role of Knossos in underpinning island-wide relative chronologies, together make an extensive discussion of these ceramic phases unavoidable. The situation at Palaikastro is markedly different. First, as a non-palatial (thus far) site in East Crete, far from the centre, Palaikastro has attracted less scholarly attention than Knossos, notwithstanding the size of the ancient settlement and its long history of research, stretching back to the first excavations in 1902. Secondly, the periods in question have always been much less well understood in eastern Crete than in the centre of the island. Whereas the distinction between MM IA, IB, IIA and IIB is now fairly well agreed upon at sites such as Knossos and Phaistos, in eastern Crete it has barely been possible to achieve much more refinement than a simple distinction between MM I and MM II.3 While recent work in east-central Crete, at Malia, Quartier Mu, has succeeded in establishing an exhaustive typology for MM II pottery at the site,4 this can only be extended with caution to the rest of eastern Crete, and this only for the MM II period. When it comes to MM III, we find that this period is very poorly represented across a whole swathe of East Cretan sites, such as Pseira, Mochlos, Gournia, Myrtos Pyrgos, Petras and Zakros.5 The LM IA styles and types in eastern Crete are rather better known, with the evidence from Gournia, and the Zakros pits, for example. Nonetheless, there is nothing approaching a ceramic typology for these periods. Here we will attempt to develop one that works for Palaikastro, and which hopefully can be extended further afield to other East Cretan sites. We are not starting from scratch, as we have presented some pottery groups for the periods in question in recent publications.6 We have extensive deposits from Rooms 10 and 45 (published as Ri and EP87) in Block M that can serve as pottery groups defining the MM IIIB phase (or PKIX in the local sequence). Albeit from another building, in this same publication the substantial deposit from Building 2 Room 2 serves as a defining pottery group for LM IA,7 one that can be very usefully supplemented by the material from Street B-M, found with lenses of Theran ash (Context StrBM.3, see Chapter 4). In PK Villa very well-preserved floor deposit of MM IA pottery from Block X Room 1 was presented, and this can serve as a pottery group defining MM IA, supplemented by the MM IA level from Block M Room 45 (Context 43-1). As for MM IB, IIA, IIB and IIIA, these phases are covered to some extent in PK VIII, but the contexts are not particularly secure, and are inadequate as 1 Handbook. 2 MM IA in Momigliano 2007; MM IB to IIIA in MacGillivray 2007; MM IIIB to LM IA in Hatzaki 2007. 3 Andreou 1978; Rnappett 2007. 4 Mu TV. 5 Macdonald and Knappett forthcoming. 6 PK ND; PK VIII. 7 PK ND. 93</page><page sequence="124">94 PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN the basis for typology and phasing. MM IB continues to be something of a problem, defined stylistically more than contextually, through the existence, for example, of the polychrome pottery known as 'Alternating Floral Style'.8 For the MM IIA, IIB and IIIA phases, however, the Block M pottery does provide important new evidence, and the possibility of securely differentiating these phases in East Crete for the first time. Rather than have individual typologies for each of these ceramic phases, we have chosen to create a typology that covers MM IA to LM IA. In this way it is easier to see the patterns of continuity and change over time, with some types appearing while others fade away. We supplement our shape typology with a discussion of wares, fabrics and decorative styles. MM IA TO LM IA TYPOLOGY The earlier phases, particularly EM IIB to EM III, are only minimally represented and thus there is little to be gained from a systematic typology. MM IA and IB are little better, but for MM IA at least we do have enough types to merit some comment. We see small drinking vessels — goblets and straight-sided cups — as well as medium-sized pouring vessels, such as bridge-spouted jars, storage wares such as lekanes, collared jars and pithoi, and tripod cooking pots and baking plates too. As is typical of MM IA throughout the island, the pottery is exclusively handmade, and we see the canonical range of wares and styles too.9 The MM IB material is very sparse, with just three catalogued vases though supplemented by sherd material. It is with MM IIA that we begin to get much more substantial deposits and the ensuing typological variability; this continues into MM IIB, with still greater quantities in the MM IIIA, IIIB and LM IA layers. The MM IIA and IIB material consists predominantly of large fills composed of sherds, whereas the MM III contexts are in many cases floor deposits with whole pots. The LM IA contexts consist of wash deposits on the one hand and some in situ deposits on the other. Thus the pottery groups for these different periods are not identical in character. Handleless Cups i . tumbler/goblet The earliest handleless cups from the late Prepalatial and Protopalatial periods are generally referred to in the literature as goblets and tumblers. The footed goblet or 'eggcup', so common at Knossos in EM III and MM IA-IIA,10 is very rare at Palaikastro. We see just a few examples in our early levels. Rather more common is the conical tumbler, which occurs in both handmade and wheelmade versions, in a variety of surface treatments.11 Also typical of East Crete (and indeed including Malia, see Quartier Mu) is the tall flaring tumbler (e.g. 17), which we see, as with the conical tumbler, in both handmade and wheelmade versions, in MM IA, IB and IIA.12 This is also one feature we use to link some of our MM II fill deposits with MM IIA rather than IIB. 2. LEDGE-RIM BOWL This type begins in MM IIIA, reaches its peak in MM IIIB before tailing off in LM IA. The MM IIIA type is distinguished by its pronounced ledge: it has a neatly tooled and distinct transition from the curving body to the flat everted 'ledge' rim (e.g. 224-228). This ledge becomes rather more continuous and indistinct in MM IIIB examples (e.g. 531-571), and those in LM IA are the same. Ledge-rim bowls are always wheelmade, using a wheel-fashioning technique based on coil-building,13 in a slightly silty, semi-fine orange fabric that sometimes fires more to buff or pink. They are also invariably plain and undecorated, with minimal surface treatment after removal from the wheel. 3. CONICAL CUP As with the ledge-rim bowl, the conical cup begins in MM IIIA and continues with some morphological changes through MM IIIB and into LM IA. Yet while the ledge-rim bowl gradually peters out after MM III, the conical cup goes from strength to strength to become the dominant cup form in LM IA, as indeed at many other Cretan sites; furthermore it continues into LM IB and beyond. The earliest 8 Floyd 1997; though note the important MM IB deposit from Petras, recently published in Haggis 2007. 9 See PK VIII, Block X Room 1. 10 See Momigliano 2007; Macdonald and Knappett 2007. 11 See PK VIII, Block X Room 1 deposit. 12 E.g. PK VIII, fig. 5 shows handmade MM IA examples, while fig. 18 shows wheelmade MM IB examples, no. 88 in Alternating Floral Style. 13 Knappett 2004.</page><page sequence="125">BLOCK M POTTERY TYPOLOGY 95 conical cups are of the tall type, often with a slight S-profile (e.g. 299-301). There is little change in profile between MM IIIA and IIIB (e.g. 509-522), but then in LM IA this tall type is completely supplanted by the canonical type seen across the island (e.g. 675-685). Like the ledge-rim bowls, they are manufactured using a wheel-fashioning technique, in the same semi-fine orange fabric, and always plain and undecorated. Handled Cups 4. CARINATED CUP The appearance of the carinated cup as a type corresponds neatly with the beginning of the Protopalatial period in MM IB, and the first systematic use of the potter's wheel, as it does at many other sites on the island, including Rnossos.14 That said, in MM IA, perhaps even late MM IA, there are some examples of handmade 'proto-carinated cups'.15 As for Palaikastro, we do not have a good enough window on MM IB to see the carinated cup's first flowering, but then the type is abundant in the MM IIA fills found on the east side of the Southeast Building. They often have offset bases, something of a regional trait (offset bases on carinated forms occur at Knossos only briefly in MM IB), and an all over black slip with white-on-dark decoration. Those with offset bases tend not to have very sharp carinations, though there are also some examples with simple bases and sharp carinations. The preponderance of offset bases on carinated cups in these fills contrasts with the picture from Quartier Mu Malia, where the MM IIB deposits have many carinated cups but very rarely with offset bases.16 This is another reason for thinking that these fills are earlier than Quartier Mu, and thus are placed in MM IIA. The MM IIB levels from Block M have less plentiful deposits of pottery; nonetheless, the offset base fades away, with simple bases more the norm. Examples with ribbing above the carination occur in both periods.17 The final throes of the carinated cup are seen in MM IIIA, when a small, plain type is produced,18 though the type is entirely absent come MM IIIB. At most other Cretan sites the carinated cup is not seen after MM IIB, though there is a relatively rare type seen in north central Crete that has a very weak carination high up on the vessel; examples are found at Rnossos,19 Anemospilia,20 and even as an import at Akrotiri, Thera.21 Finally, a rare variant of the carinated cup is the kantharos, essentially a carinated cup with two vertical handles. One possible example from Block M is the striking applique vessel, 31. 5. BEVELLED CUP The bevelled cup is a short-lived type found predominantly in MM IIA, though this is not to exclude its possible appearance also in MM IB and IIB. It is related to the carinated cup, with its pronounced low bevel almost having the appearance of a carination (e.g. 95). Bevelled cups are small, with a rim diameter around 8 cm.22 They are invariably black-slipped with white-on-dark or polychrome decoration.23 6. STRAIGHT-SIDED CUP: STRAIGHT/BEVELLED/FLANGED While the carinated cup is probably the most popular handled cup during MM I—II, it is the straight sided cup that is the most common in MM III, continuing also into LM IA. The type does begin earlier, in MM IA even (e.g. 2),24 continuing through into MM IB and II (e.g. 120), though never as established a type in these phases as it is at sites like Knossos or Malia.25 These early versions tend to have slightly concave bodies and a straight edge at the base; they are also generally black-slipped with white-on-dark or polychrome decoration. In MM IIIA some changes are seen: the base edges tend to be bevelled, though some straight edges continue, and the form becomes quite broad (e.g. 231-233), often with a matt dark slip all over and white-on-dark decoration of large retorted spirals (e.g. plate 22 c)-26 The bevel is supplemented with a pronounced flange on MM IIIB examples (e.g. 440), when the type becomes particularly common, as seen in the Room 10 (Ri) deposit.27 These 14 See Knappett 1999; Macdonald and Knappett 2007; MacGillivray 2007. 15 PK VIII. 16 MuIV.

Another type seen in MM IIIB has a more rounded base edge and is decorated with tortoiseshell ripple (672). Though a little less common in LM IA, the flanged base type nevertheless continues, now often with white-on dark floral scroll at the upper-mid body, as in the examples from the Zakros Pits.28 Also here included within the category 'straight-sided cup' is a version unique to LM IA that is relatively small, has slightly convex walls and is usually decorated inside and out with dark-on-light floral motifs.29 7. hemispherical CUP Like the straight-sided cup, the hemispherical cup is a type that is seen at Palaikastro from MM I to LM I, although the MM IA version does not have the everted rim that later becomes canonical.30 Whereas hemispherical cups are relatively common throughout MM II at palatial sites such as Knossos, Phaistos and Malia, they seem to be quite thin on the ground at Palaikastro, at least in Block M. When they do occur they are dark slipped with simple white-on-dark decoration (e.g. 135-138).31 One particularly noteworthy example which straddles the MM II-IIIA divide, is a polychrome cup (214), almost eggshell ware, with a much taller rim than is typical of most hemispherical cups, and with parallels to a cup found in a tomb at Khaiji in Beirut, as mentioned in a preliminary report.32 This is, however, a one-off, and perhaps an import to Palaikastro from Knossos. More typically, in MM IIIA the hemispherical cup does seem to increase in popularity, and sees the addition of a footed base in some cases, while the slip tends to be more purple-brown than black, a shift also noticed by Evans for the finewares at Knossos.33 This trend continues into MM IIIB, when these cups also acquire in numerous instances a set of three finely tooled grooves at the exterior lower body and one at the interior base (e.g. 391; this may begin in MM IIIA). MM IIIB also sees, however, the beginnings of dark-on-light decoration on hemispherical cups, with crescents appearing for example (268). By LM IA dark-on-light hemispherical cups are the norm, decorated with spirals in the most part, often of medallion type (e.g. 873), but note also the occurrence of other motifs such as diagonal branches, and of course the continuation of white-on-dark, particularly in the form of floral scroll, as seen indeed in the straight-sided cups too. 8. ROUNDED CUP The term 'rounded cup' is here reserved for a particular type that has convex walls, and occurs principally in MM IIIB, as witnessed in Room 10 and published in 2003.34 Note that in these cases it invariably has a dip-rim and trickle dark-on-light decoration. 9. S-PROFILE CUP This is another type seen predominantly in MM IIIB, as represented in the Room 10 destruction deposit.35 It has a strap handle and is undecorated (e.g. 588). Note also, however, two similar examples from the LM IA deposit of Building 2 Room 2.36 10. TRIPOD CUP Tripod cups in MM II tend to be conical, as at Malia for example.37 Here we have one example (252) from an MM IIIA context that is also conical, with short curled feet, suggesting that the type does continue. However, come MM IIIB, most examples are larger, with a convex profile, rounded handle and often white pendent festoons.38 11. big-handled/dipper cup This type, generally with a convex profile and a large roll handle, in a coarse red clay and undecorated, is long-lived. At Palaikastro we have an example from MM IB;39 from Malia, they are quite common in MM II;40 and in MM IIIB they occur at Palaikastro.41 Other catalogued examples from Block M are present in MM IIIB (643) and in LM IA (728). 28 Popham 1967. 29 An example can be seen in PK VIII, cat. 406, fig. 43. 30 PK VIII, fig. 6. 31 PKND, fig. 25. 32 PK 1994/6, 239, fig. 15; cat. 5938. 33 PMI, 552. 34 PKND, fig. 15. 35 PKND, fig. 15. 36 PK ND, fig. 44. 37 Mu IV, cat. 1017, pi. 30. 38 PK ND, figs. 16 and 32. 39 PK VIII, fig. 19. 40 Mu IV, cat. 1004, pi. 30. 41 PKND, fig. 33.</page><page sequence="127">BLOCK M POTTERY TYPOLOGY 97 12. BASKET CUP This relatively rare type seems to be predominantly an MM IIB and IIIA product. It consists of a simple tall conical form that is elliptical at the rim with small vertical handles attached at the long part of the elliptical rim, thereby mimicking a basket with handles. In MM II they are present at Malia;42 and in MM IIIA as an import at Akrotiri.43 Here in Block M the sole example (221) comes from an MM IIIA context and is decorated with white-on-dark dots. Bowls 13. DIP-RIM BOWL This type appears first in MM IIIA and then continues through MM IIIB into LM IA. It has a conical or slightly convex profile, often with a slightly thickened and flattened rim, and then decoration of dark-on-light paint around the rim. The fact that the paint occurs to the same depth both inside and outside (see 446), and often has trickles down the body, strongly suggests that this paint was applied by dipping the bowl upside down into the paint before turning it upright and leaving it to dry. Previously published examples from Room 10 can be dated to MM IIIB.44 14. PINCHED-RIM BOWL This appears to be a type fossil of MM IIIA at Palaikastro. It is not a very common type, but seems only to occur in MM IIIA contexts thus far. It is a small form, only c. 4 cm tall in most cases, with a rounded profile and everted rim, with some pinching of the rim (the purpose of which is unclear). An example from Gamma 48, also in a MM IIIA context has recently been published.45 As is seen in this example and those from the catalogue here (444-445, 666, 753), this type also tends to have a dipped rim in dark-on-light paint, though monochrome examples occur. 15. ROUNDED BOWL (INCLUDING 'BELL CUP') This type occurs from MM II through to LM I, albeit with varying shape details and decoration. In MM III there is a variant with an offset base, often with a dark slip and white-on-dark decoration of bands (667) or sometimes thick running spirals in white-on-dark.46 We also encounter a variant in an MM IIIB context with a flattened, everted rim with incised decoration and added red bands on a dark slip (386). In LM IA examples occur with dark-on-light olive spray decoration (867), and in the so-called 'bell cup' variant (973). This type is also found in Building 2 Room 2, one of our type deposits for LM IA.47 16. IN-AND-OUT BOWL In terms of shape, the in-and-out bowl is a broad rounded bowl with a simple straight rim. It is decorated both inside and outside with dark-on-light painted motifs. It is a type seen commonly in central Crete, for example at Knossos, where it is considered a hallmark of MM IIIB,48 though it does also occur both earlier in MM IIIA and later in LM IA. The decoration is usually of bands with tortoiseshell ripple, or wavy lines (360, 383), though floral motifs are also combined (385, 596, 957, 969) ;49 MM IIIA examples in particular may have featherwave, either by itself (333) or in combination with ripple (e.g. 239). 1 7. BOWL-LADLE This is a type that first appears in East Crete in MM II, and is particularly well attested at Malia, where it is called the puisette.50 With its peculiar internal strap handle and opposed spout, this type probably functioned as a scoop for small quantities of liquid.51 The type continues into MM III in East Crete, seen here in Block M in both MM IIIA and IIIB. These examples often have applique barnacle effect at the rim, derivative of the rather more neat shell appliques seen on the earlier Malia cases. They often also have a dark-on-light dipped rim with trickle (601-603), sometimes with added 42 Mu IV, 1174-5, pl- 52 43 Knappett and Nikolakopoulou 2008, fig. 20. 44 PKND, fig. 11. 45 PK VIII; cat. 8i, fig. 15. 46 PK VIII, cat. 135, fig. 27; PK ND, cat. 188, fig. 47 PKND, fig. 45 48 Hatzaki 2007, fig. 5.4. 49 See also PK ND, cat. 191, fig. 50 Mu IV, cat. 701-719, pi. 27. 51 Poursat 1984; Floyd 1999</page><page sequence="128">98 PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN white, or pendent festoons in white-on-dark (361). Some are reused as lamps (e.g. 601). See also discussion of an example from Kea.52 18. FLARING SAUCER This is a small, thin-walled flaring bowl seen particularly in MM II, though we have one possible survivor in an MM IIIA context. Two of the catalogued examples (43, 139) have all-over white slip, a feature also observed on this and other types at Malia in MM II.53 Another example is plain (9548), while the one from an MM IIIA context (207) has deep dark-on-light festoons at the interior. 19. FLARING BOWL This is the larger and coarser version of the flaring saucer, usually in a coarse cooking pot fabric and plain; MM II examples tend to be handmade (70, 71, 117), though a later MM IIIB specimen (600) is wheelmade. They generally have a rim diameter of c. 25 cm. They are related typologically to the conical bowl or kalathos (see below). 20. CONICAL BOWL (KALATHOS) Like the flaring bowl, this type is most often in a coarse cooking pot fabric and undecorated, being either handmade or wheelmade depending on the period: 141 is a handmade MM II example, while later ones are wheelmade. These too have a rim diameter of c. 25 cm. 21. FLARING TRIPOD BOWL This is predominantly an MM II shape, and is particularly well represented in East Crete at Malia and at Myrtos Pyrgos.54 Palaikastro MM II examples often have applique at the interior (e.g. 75). 22. PEDESTALLED ROUNDED BOWL The only restorable example (604) of this type comes from the MM IIIB destruction deposit of Room 1 o. It is heavily burnt at the interior, in a coarse fabric and undecorated. Its rim diameter is c. 21 cm. A second example, 339, from an MM IIIA context, has only the pedestal and base, and might have continued to form a rounded bowl. It has two raised ridges at the interior base with added white paint. Pouring Vessels 23. BRIDGE-SPOUTED JUGS Most of the examples from Block M come from MM II contexts (110, 101, 142, 143) and are closely comparable to examples from the MM IIB destruction of Quartier Mu at Malia.55 This carinated type is especially favoured in East Crete during this period. Note that 101 is a probable foundation deposit that helps to provide a terminus post quem for the construction of the SE Building, either in late MM IIB or early MM IIIA. 24. BRIDGE-SPOUTED JARS Far more common than the bridge-spouted jug is the bridge-spouted jar, one of the most commonly occurring pouring vessels throughout the time span with which we are concerned. We have a number of fragmentary examples from a clear MM IA context (Context 45.1', 4-7), which can be supplemented by the more complete examples recently published from Block X Room 1.56 These are generally decorated in white-on-dark, and sometimes polychromy. The type again occurs frequently in our MM IIA fills (e.g. 45-48, 50, 54, 55), again either white-on-dark or polychrome. The type continues strongly into MM III, when it is seen in large examples in both MM IIIA (242-244, 254) and MM IIIB (403-404, 406, 468), with tortoiseshell ripple decoration. Sometimes there is also an added red band (295). The early occurrence of this decorative motif on closed vessels such as bridge-spouted jars is now well attested from closed deposits equivalent to MM IIIA from Akrotiri on Thera.57 Other large bridge-spouted jars in MM IIIA bear white-on-dark spirals, either 52 Georgiou 1986,46-7. 53 Poursat and Knappett 2005. 54 Mu IV, pi. 31; Cadogan and Knappett in preparation. 55 Mu IV, cat. 640, pi. 24. 56 PK VIII, fig. 7. 57 Knappett and Nikolakopoulou 2008.</page><page sequence="129">BLOCK M POTTERY TYPOLOGY 99 loose (253, 283) or tight (282), the latter with good parallels in fase III at Phaistos.58 In MM IIIB a small variant with more convex-concave profile is also found (451), often with small rectangular grooved handles and a dark slip, and sometimes white-on-dark bands.59 This type is also found in two different MM IIIB contexts in Building 6 (364, 449), with a dark-on-light decoration of petaloid loops, a style that one might more readily associate with LM IA, but here providing further evidence of the beginnings of lustrous dark-on-light floral motifs before the end of MM IIIB. That said, one example does also occur in an LM IA context in Room 8 (757), and other LM IA examples occur with other dark-on-light motifs such as medallion spirals (729). 25. BEAKED JUGS As with the bridge-spouted jar, this is a long-lived type of pouring vessel that sees changes in shape details and decoration through its lifespan. Early examples occur in the MM IIA fills (51, 56, 98), generally rather large examples (though fragmentary) and not especially fine. One of them (51) bears a potter's mark at the shoulder. The MM IIIA examples are also generally rather coarse, and plain (280) or with rudimentary decoration of white-on-dark spirals (240). This pattern continues into MM IIIB, with examples that are semi-fine and plain (606), or quite coarse and plain (667, 607), or coarse with white-on-dark bands (449), spirals (404), well burnished with dark-on-light bands and spirals (lower body only; 633), or semi-coarse with trickle (634). LM IA examples have medallion spirals (765, 908), floral scroll (873-874), are plain (872) or with lilies and added red band (784), in an imported (South Coast?) fabric, though for this we only have the lower body and it is not necessarily a jug. A subclass to note is the jug with trefoil mouth, of which there are just three catalogued examples. 605 and 241 are relatively coarse and plain, as is 293, though this has a potter's mark. 26. ASKOS Three examples are catalogued, one from an MM IIIA context (312) and two from MM IIIB contexts (400-401). All are small and globular, of a type with a small squared handle at the top and a tubular side spout; each has a rather flaky, fugitive buff slip over a semi-fine orange to pink local fabric. Over the buff slip there appears to be dark-on-light decoration, perhaps of bands and some other motif; ripple is likely though cannot be clearly discerned. A very good parallel for 312 comes from Knossos, an MM IIlA context excavated by Evans on the East Slope of the Palace, known as the Pit in the Room East of the School Room.60 This example from Knossos has a very similar fabric and surface treatment, entirely out of place at Knossos, and would thus seem in all likelihood to be imported from Palaikastro. 27. STRAINERS (CUP/DOUBLE JUGS/JARS) This functional category here includes three different shapes: spouted hemispherical cup, double jug and globular jar. All have multiple pierced holes indicating some possible use in straining liquids of some kind; though more precise functions have been proposed,61 it is difficult to be certain how such vessels were used, and we receive little help in this from their contexts. As it is the earliest example, we start with 292, a spouted hemispherical cup with internal strainer. Its decoration of white-on-dark wavy lines and dots places it firmly in MM IIIA. It has a separated interior section (see FIG. 5.15), presumably for straining liquids. The next type is the double jug, represented by two examples, 736 and 693- One of these, 736. is much more complete, and is decorated with an applique bird and snake at its rim. These features find some late parallels in LM II—IIIA 1, and hence the vase was assigned this date in the preliminary report.52 However, it is in a context that is in all likelihood LM IA, and the dark-on-light diagonal branch motifs find sound parallels in LM IA. Moreover, 693, found in a nearby room, and of a very similar shape, also comes from an LM IA context, and has a dark slip with fugitive white painted decoration: such a surface treatment places it securely in LM IA, if not a little earlier in MM IIIB. As for parallels from Palaikastro, an example that is probably later, perhaps LM IB, is illustrated from Block Pi Room 7.63 Bosanquet comments that this is a long-lived type, with parallels from the First Ossuary at Palaikastro (MM), Gournia (LM I) and Knossos, Tomb of the Double Axes (early LM III). He goes on to suggest that 'as the liquor could only be poured in through the strainer, the object of protecting the mouth was probably not so much to strain the 58 Levi and Carinci 1988; Girella 2007; see also Kommos, Betancourt 1985, log. 59 PKND, fig. 18. 60 See Knappett et al. in preparation. 61 Vlasaki 1987. 62 PK 1994/6, fig. 17.

Our three specimens all come from LM IA contexts and have typical LM IA lustrous dark-on-light decoration of medallion spirals (785), spirals (786) and diagonal branches (879). On this type the strainer section sits between the lower body and the wide splayed foot. There are ample parallels from Palaikastro, such as from a trial trench E of Block Delta, where a large example was found with medallion spirals and other motifs, and referred to as a 'waisted strainer',65 and also from House N.66 At Mochlos examples occur in LM IB styles,67 and see also Zakros.68 28. RHYTA Two examples of what are probably rhyta, of the handleless piriform type, are preserved in our MM III levels. The uncertainty is due to the fact that we only have the rim and neck preserved in each case (402 and 632). The type seems to be common in MM III.69 There is also what appears to be a jar rhyton, 335, that is to say a simple small jar shape with a pierced base. Parallels for this kind of jar or bowl rhyton do exist, e.g. at Pera Galenoi in MM IIIA, with a clay version of a bird's nest bowl usually in stone.70 29. MINIATURES Miniatures come in a limited range of forms, most being closed vessels. One exception is a miniature tumbler (443), found in an MM IIIB context in Room 8, and barely miniature in size being 4 cm tall and with a rim diameter of nearly 6 cm. More typically we find juglets, amphoras and jars, ranging in date from MM IIIA to LM IA. The miniature juglets (270, 363, 448) have dark paint at the upper body only, sometimes dipped, sometimes painted, and in one case with added white bands (363). Two miniature jars come from MM IIIA contexts (311, 337), while miniature amphoras are found in MM IIIA (336), MM IIIB (410) and LM IA (731) contexts. Finally, there is a single miniature tripod cooking pot from an MM IIIA context. Miniatures are perhaps generally considered to have a cultic function, and indeed they are common on peak sanctuaries and in burials, though also frequently found in settlement contexts that do not seem to be anything other than domestic.71 Storage Wares 30. globular/collar-necked jar Though a rather general type, all catalogued examples here come from MM IIIB contexts. The shape is conical at the lower body rising to a globular upper body with an incurving rim to a low collar, and two horizontal roll handles at the maximum diameter high on the vessel. 662, for example, is wheelmade, in a coarse red-grey fabric and with white-on-dark spirals at the upper body; note too it has two small vertical handles supplementing the two horizontal ones. Note a shorter variant of this type that is more globular: 609 is a plain example, with two horizontal handles, while 608 is a unique case with two vertical handles to the rim and ripple decoration at the upper body. 31. AMPHORA For such a large set of buildings, amphoras and other storage and transport wares are very rare (see also pithoi, and pithoid jars). We have just a handful of catalogued examples, principally from MM IIIA and IIIB contexts, and with none complete: most are just the mouth and handles. In MM II the amphora exists too, most notably with a distinctive bichrome decoration of dark bands with white piping. These handmade examples continue a little into MM IIIA, with 342 an example. Most examples in MM III tend to have bands or trickle decoration in dark-on-light (318-320, 340). Parallels are found in the EP87 closet (Context 45.4) of the NW Building of Block M.72 There are also some small amphoras, verging on the miniature, which are in a hard-fired semi-coarse buff and in all likelihood imports from north-central Crete (408-409). 64 PKU, 41. 65 PK III, 209-10; see also PKU, 33, 66. 66 PK VII, fig. 15. 67 Mochlos IB, fig. 28. 68 Hogarth 1902,pi.

LEKANE This is a tall cylindrical shape, not unlike a bucket, and often has a flattened, thickened and slightly everted rim. Examples come from MM II levels, when they are in some cases Mirabello imports (e.g. 147), and sometimes with bridge-spout (e.g. 68). The type continues into the Neopalatial period, usually plain and in a local coarse fabric (e.g. 638). 33. BEEHIVE LEKANE The beehive lekane or basin is a long-lived type, encountered at various sites across the island in MM IB,73 MM IIB,74 and LM IA.75 Here we see an example (669) from an MM IIIB context, with the same distinctive criss-cross incisions at the interior of a large, broad cylindrical basin, and the thumb impressions at the interior base (though these are not seen on all examples). 34. PITHOID JAR As stated above in relation to amphoras, storage vessels are remarkably rare in Block M. There is only one restorable example of a pithoid jar, 653, from the wine press. The other two catalogued examples consist only of a body sherd (273) and lower body fragments (411) and so are somewhat conjectural. However, 653 is very interesting for a number of reasons. It has a decoration of ripple, crescents, and bands in dark-on-light, and white-on-dark spirals and meanders. This combination is archetypal for MM IIIB, and this assignation fits its context very well too. The shape, however, is much more commonly encountered in LM IA and IB, as in the palace at Zakros for example,76 or on Pseira,77 and this may be the earliest example yet known. It is also notable that the vessel is wheelmade, an early application of the wheel to such a large vessel (more than 50 cm tall). 35. PITHOS The pithos, like the pithoid jar and the amphora, is a remarkably rare type in Block M, which cannot have been much used for storage. This raises the question of where everyday commodities would have been stored, and the possibility that storage was organised at the palatial level does suggest itself (though of course we have not excavated a palatial building at the site, though one is suspected). In MM IIIA contexts we see the base of a large handmade specimen (255), but with next to no shape details to comment upon; and the upper body of another handmade example (341). In MM IIIB, 457 and 458 are base and rim fragments respectively of a conical type seen commonly in MM III elsewhere;78 note the rim and upper body of an example from the EP87 closet (Context 45.4).'79 The only complete example (640) comes from the MM III wine press installation and was actually embedded in the ground to catch the run-off from the wine press. Cooking Wares 36. TRIPOD COOKING BOWLS This type is wider than it is tall, with an open mouth, simple straight rim, two horizontal roll handles and a pulled rim spout. Examples occur in MM IIIA (279), MM IIIB (454) and LM IA (694-695, 737-738, 948). The rim diameter is usually around 20 cm. There are good MM IIIB parallels from Rooms 10a and 45.80 37. TRIPOD COOKING JARS This tall jar type of tripod cooking pot is common at Palaikastro, and we see it in MM IIIA, MM IIIB and LM IA contexts, though it seems to be at its peak in MM IIIB. There is often vertical applique rope band on the thick ovoid tripod legs, and sometimes in horizontal bands at the lower body too. There are good MM IIIB parallels from Rooms 10a and 45.81 73 E.g. at Knossos: Macdonald and Knappett 2007, cat. 259, fig. 3.14. 74 E.g.

BAKING PLATE The baking plate is a very common and distinctive Minoan shape, found all over the island and throughout the Bronze Age.82 Here we see catalogued examples primarily from MM IIIB and LM IA contexts. A very well preserved example comes from the destruction deposit of Room 10 (610), and another MM IIIB specimen comes from Room 8 (456). The other catalogued MM IIIB piece is a special case, as not only is it a particular type with a broad slab-like leg support (641), but it is being used secondarily as packing to keep the wine-press pithos in place. The LM IA examples (e.g. 755 759, 949) sometimes have a distinctive thumb impression at their upper corners. Baking plates are used particularly in LM IA contexts as part of the 'squatter' occupation of Building 6 after the MM IIIB seismic destruction. 39. BAKING DISH This is a rare type, with just one catalogued example (671) from an MM IIIB context. It seems to serve much the same purpose as the baking plate, though has a higher thicker rim, is flat-bottomed rather than sloping, and has a buff slip and burnish to its upper side. Although earlier, in MM IIB, parallels for the shape can be found in Quartier Mu, Malia.83 They are also found quite frequently in MM IIB at Myrtos Pyrgos.84 40. HEARTH This is simply a large flat ceramic slab, roughly 2.5 cm thick, with square edge(s). 338, for example, has a rough underside like a baking plate and a smooth upper surface, hence the suggestion that this form may have been some kind of hearth used in cooking. Others 41. LID Perhaps rather oddly, we have just two catalogued examples, from MM IIIB and LM IA contexts. The former (673) has dark-on-light bands, discs and ripple, while the latter (830) has glossy dark-on light bands, added white, and a grooved square handle not unlike the one seen on the askos 312. These are both small fine lids with convex profile. 42. FENESTRATED STAND This is described by Bosanquet as a 'tripod lamp stand',85 though it is more accurate to describe it as a tall annular stand with cut-out 'windows' — hence the revised name 'fenestrated stand'. It is a reasonably common form at Palaikastro, particularly in LM IA, though here we also have a fragment from an MM IIIA context (256). It is also known from other sites in East Crete, such as Gournia,86 and perhaps Mochlos (Barnard, pers. comm.), though it is not known from central Crete. 43. HAND-LAMP We have four catalogued hand-lamps from MM IIIA (269, 316), IIIB (399) and LM IA (733) contexts, though the type does occur earlier in MM II as well (78-79). As far as can be discerned they all have an incurving rim, a vertical roll handle and a pulled rim spout. 44. SCUTTLE Here we see just one catalogued example, albeit incomplete, 314, from an MM IIIA context: it is plain and with a little burning to its interior. This type is effectively discussed by Georgiou, who emphasises that the scuttle is commonly seen from MM III to LM III, while citing EM II examples from Myrtos Fournou Korifi too.87 Slipped and burnished examples are now also known from Knossos in MM IIA.88 Betancourt 1980.

FIREBOX We have examples from MM IIIB (467) and LM IA (884).89 Note too that it is a long-lived type whose typology and function are discussed by Georgiou.90 46. compotier/fruitstand This is a very characteristic type at Malia Quartier Mu in MM II.91 Here we have just one fragmentary example of the bowl (76) from an MM IIA context. 'Kamares' fruitstands are also mentioned from the first campaign of excavation at Palaikastro.92 47. two-holed vase This is a rather common type at Malia in MM II, where it is called the 'vase a deux trous', and where it has been found frequently enough in Quartier Mu to suggest that the end with two holes is the upper part.93 Here we see just one example, from an LM IA context (829). Dawkins illustrates another example but probably shown the wrong way up in his drawing.94 FABRICS The pottery fabrics found at Palaikastro for the periods in question are overwhelmingly local. We do not find the large quantities of imports found at other large Cretan settlements such as Knossos or Malia.95 Smaller non-palatial sites can also have more imports than are encountered at Palaikastro, as is the case at Myrtos Pyrgos in MM II.96 Imports from the Mirabello area do appear in MM I—II contexts, but are very sparse after that; and there is no doubt some more localised movement of pottery from nearby sites such as Zakros. There is next to nothing recognisably imported from off island. While this may to some extent be attributable to the area of the site excavated (perhaps a central building might contain many imports), it may also reflect a true situation. If so, this is somewhat surprising given the coastal location of the settlement and its presumed role in maritime trade. The local fine ware fabrics at Palaikastro differ from those on many other parts of the island, particularly central Crete, in their colour and texture. They tend to be orange to pink in colour and quite silty, semi-fine rather than fine, and not the fine buff fabrics seen elsewhere. This is because the Neogene calcareous marine clay deposits so common in the centre of the island are all but absent in this part of East Crete; although note Petras, for example, as an exception.97 Whenever a hard-fired fine buff fabric is found at Palaikastro there is good reason to suspect it as an import. The fine wares are not homogeneous over time, as those in the Protopalatial period do seem generally to be paler and finer than those in the Neopalatial period; yet between MM IIIA, MM IIIB and LM IA there is little evident macroscopic difference in the fine wares. As for the coarser wares, transport and storage vessels also occur often in a semi-coarse to coarse orange fabric that contains phyllite and other inclusions, broadly compatible with the local geology. The cooking pot wares are the typical coarse red-brown with phyllite inclusions that are seen in many parts of the island with outcrops of the phyllite-quartzite series. We stress, however, that our macroscopic fabric observations at Palaikastro are not underpinned by microscopic analyses using ceramic petrography. While this technique has been used extensively for sites in the centre of the island,98 it has only seen some limited use in the far east of Crete.99 While the work of Day on the Neopalatial period is relevant to our study, the samples studied were principally of coarse wares from a range of sites in East Crete, and thus not specific to Palaikastro. That of Doherty was a very limited study of conical cups from the LM IIIA2 deposits in the wells, and thus of only indirect relevance to the current work. He notes that the main inclusion types are quartz, phyllite and limestone, and that the local fabrics 'appear to have been formed from unmodified clays',100 observations that probably pertain to many of the conical cup and ledge-rim bowl fabrics in this 89 For LM IA examples from Palaikastro, see PK ND, cats. 446-447, fig. 46), for MM IIIB examples, see PK ND, cat. 196, fig. 24. 90 Georgiou 1986, 4-12. 91 Mu IV, 84 and fig. 27. 92 PK11, 278, 308. 95 Knappett 1997; for other examples from Malia, see van Effenterre (1976, pi.

Nonetheless, this does not reduce the urgent need for a detailed and comprehensive fabric study of the full Palaikastro ceramic sequence, integrating macroscopic study in hand specimen with a full programme of thin section petrography and supplemented by chemical analysis where necessary. WARES AND STYLES During the periods in question Palaikastro sees the typical range of wares observed at most Cretan sites. There are fine tablewares, storage wares and cooking pot wares; and a range of surface treatments described as 'wares', such as plain, monochrome, dark-on-light, white-on-dark, polychrome and bichrome. As almost everywhere else, there is a general shift from a predominance of white-on-dark and polychrome wares through the Middle Minoan period, particularly MM I—II, to a greater emphasis on dark-on-light decorated wares in MM IIIB and especially LM IA. Also apparent is the marked shift at the beginning of the Neopalatial period, i.e. MM IIIA, towards the 'mass production' of small handleless cups, here both conical cups and ledge-rim bowls. However, there are some particular regional features within this general picture. It has long been noted that white-on-dark pottery continues to be manufactured in East Crete well into the Neopalatial period, and this is certainly borne out by the Block M evidence. While the various kinds of white-on-dark motifs in MM II and MM III are generally well known (e.g. thick retorted spirals in MM IIIA at many sites, such as Kommos, Phaistos and indeed Palaikastro), there are specific East Cretan variants, such as the floral scroll applied not only in white-on-dark but also in dark-on-light during LM IA. Other dark-on-light styles in LM IA are also specifically East Cretan, such as diagonal branches, while central Cretan motifs such as reed pattern are all but absent in the east. Nonetheless, some dark-on-light styles are found in both central and eastern Crete, particularly tortoiseshell ripple, which we see appearing at Palaikastro in MM IIIA and increasing into MM MB before fading away again in LM IA; this is the same picture generally as that seen at sites such as Knossos, Kommos and Phaistos.101 Some wares which one might expect to feature we mention here only in passing. There is no 'burnished ware' category as such: though some vases, particularly in dark-on-light, may receive some burnishing, they are not considered here as burnished ware. At Malia in MM II there are categories of 'buff burnished ware' and 'red burnished ware' but these do not seem to be present here, though the latter might have appeared had we encountered more pedestalled lamps in our assemblages, for example. 'Incised ware' does not figure either; this is not to say that none of the pottery is ever incised, just that it does not constitute a coherent category. 'Barbotine ware' occurs in small quantities in our MM IB and IIA levels, but it is a very minor category. Plain Ware This is the most straightforward as it involves no surface treatment whatsoever, other than some simple smoothing or paring perhaps. The most common plain wares are the conical cups and ledge-rim bowls of MM IIIA to LM IA. Small vessels of this kind are very rarely plain in the preceding periods, except for some plain tumblers that occur in MM IIA contexts (e.g. 13-14). Of course, a rather different category of plain ware consists of the cooking pots, baking plates and other basic domestic items which are also generally untreated with slip or decoration (except applique rope bands, perhaps). Monochrome Slipped Ware During the Protopalatial period a large proportion of the tablewares are given a dark monochrome slip, often firing to black but also to brown or various shades in between. These dark-slipped vessels may on many occasions also be treated with additional white paint as decoration, though this falls under the separate heading of 'white-on-dark ware' below. This form of surface treatment continues to be popular into the Middle Minoan III period, with numerous straight-sided cups in particular treated with a dark brown slip (though sometimes it is difficult discerning any white decoration that might also have been added). Dark-slipped wares do become noticeably less common in the LM I period. White-on-Dark Ware This category overlaps with the former, as many vessels in white-on-dark ware have been treated with a dark slip first before the white painted decoration is applied. This is not necessarily the case, however, 101 See Hatzaki 2007; Girella 2007.</page><page sequence="135">BLOCK M POTTERY TYPOLOGY as in some instances the white paint may be applied directly on a dark clay ground, particularly with some of the local dark red fabrics at Palaikastro. The most common motif is simple sets of bands, as can be observed frequently on straight-sided cups from the MM III period. Cups of this type in MM III also sometimes have large thick retorted spirals (902). Straight-sided cups in the LM IA period are also decorated in white-on-dark, a practice that dies out in the centre of the island; but here they can be decorated with floral scroll (946), very much an East Cretan feature. Various kinds of white-on dark styles can be seen on MM I—II pottery as well, including horizontal and diagonal curving bands (e.g. 25, 28), quirks (34), dots (53), flecks (62), spirals (16) or imitation stone veining (441). Polychrome Ware Polychromy survives the length of the MM period, beginning clearly in MM IA and just seeing its final stage in MM IIIB. It is most commonly encountered here in Block M in the MM IIA levels, where we find the 'Diagonal Red and White Style' (40), though it is really an MM IB style. We do not, however, see any examples of another MM IB polychrome style, the 'Alternating Floral Style'. Other polychrome motifs that do belong in MM II are the diagonal criss-cross lines (26, 134), dots (42, 125), and a flower rosette (27), though these are very rare. Note too the dotted meander with accessory red on the Kamares eggshell cup 214, from an MM IIIA context. Polychromy appears to survive longest on rounded bowls, where the red is a simple band accompanying a white-on-dark thick retorted spiral. Dark-on-Light Ware (with Added White) This ware comes in a wide variety of motifs and applications, ranging from simple dipped rims or trickle on relatively coarse or unsmoothed vessels, to intricate floral motifs on highly burnished, glossy surfaces. Generally dark-on-light is rare in the MM I—II periods, except perhaps for bands and trickle on transport and storage wares, and in the one off case that is 63. In the MM III period the dark-on light decorative technique is used with some regularity on certain cup and bowl forms such as S profile cups, rounded cups and dip-rim bowls, often with a simple dipping of the rim in a dark paint.102 One also sees flecking on some forms, such as the bridge-spouted jar 365. In general, though, there is a broad trend whereby dark-on-light wares supersede white-on-dark wares through the course of the MM III period and into LM IA, which is of course characterised across the island by fine decorated dark-on-light wares. However, these well-known dark-on-light styles do not just appear overnight in LM IA. Tortoiseshell ripple, for example, begins as early as MM IIIA, which is also now clearly attested at other sites, such as Knossos and Akrotiri. It is nonetheless most common in MM IIIB (e.g. 468, 653, 672), while continuing into LM IA (e.g. on cup 866). Tortoiseshell ripple probably evolves out of another motif that we call 'featherwave', consisting of multiple thin wavy lines. This first appears in MM IIB (with good parallels from Malia and Myrtos Pyrgos), and continues into MM III, when it appears together with ripple in most cases, as with an in-and-out bowl 239.103 Both featherwave and ripple may well be skeuomorphic decorative schemes, imitating materials such as wood or stone. Simple motifs such as bands and spirals also occur in dark-on-light, having previously been relatively common in white-on-dark in MM III. The type of spiral changes, with the tight thin spiral and thick retorted spirals seen in white-on-dark disappearing, and a more neatly painted spiral with central dot and added white dots taking over, known as the medallion spiral (e.g. 692, 729, 765 and 785). Another relatively simple motif is the frieze of crescents, which differs from the medallion spiral in actually appearing in some instances earlier than LM IA, in MM III, such as on hemispherical cup 268 and pithoid jar 653.104 Finally, in dark-on-light a range of stylised floral motifs are seen, and these are rather characteristic of East Cretan LM IA. Probably the most common is 'foliate scroll', which sees a frieze of floral tendrils unfurling around the mid-body of either open or closed vessels (e.g. 873, 874). Also occurring in a similar kind of frieze is running ivy, as on hemispherical cup 964, though this can also occur in some instances in white-on-dark (919). 'Petaloid loops' seems thus far to be a solely dark-on-light motif, seen principally on closed vessels, such as bridge-spouted jars 449 and 757. The diagonal branch is again limited to dark-on-light, as on the double strainer jug 736 and waisted strainer 879. Rather more unique dark-on-light motifs include the isolated spiral with hatched stem and tendrils, seen on both waisted strainer 786 and in-and-out bowl 969, and the field of isolated lilies on closed vessel 784.

See also PK Vlll. 104 see also PK ND.</page><page sequence="136">106 PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN White Slipped Ware This is a peculiarity of MM II, which sees the slipping of vases in the white paint that is normally used for white decoration over a dark ground. It is seen at Malia in MM II as well,105 but does not find many other parallels. It tends to occur on flaring saucers, e.g. 43, but here is also seen on a basket vase 154, which itself has strong parallels with Malia, and may even be an import from that site. Bichrome Ware This too is a surface treatment seen only in MM II. It is essentially the use of a dark-on-light technique, usually just bands, with the addition of white piping. It is seen particularly on a certain class of amphora in MM II contexts. Similar bichrome techniques are seen at Malia in this period, and indeed in the Mesara where amphora are decorated in dark-on-light triple axe motifs with white piping.106 Applique Ware This is not a particularly coherent category, but it does reflect a particular tendency at Palaikastro in MM II to use various kinds of applique decoration, particularly at the interiors of vessels. This is seen on the insides of tripod flaring bowls or braziers most commonly, such as 73 and 75, but also on the inside of the remarkable kantharos 31. 105 Mu IV. 106 Levi and Carinci ig88; Mu IV.</page><page sequence="137">Chapter 4 Block M in the Prepalatial and Protopalatial periods NEOLITHIC AND PREPALATIAL PERIODS Although there are signs of occupation in the surrounding region during the Neolithic, for example at Magasa1 and Plakalona,2 and perhaps on the nearby rocky promontory of Kastri,3 it is during the Early Minoan or Prepalatial period that the site proper of Palaikastro — i.e. Roussolakkos — is first occupied. The first excavators attributed this earliest occupation to EM I, not so unreasonable in the light of recent evidence from other sites in the region, such as Ayia Photia Kouphota and Kephala.4 Nonetheless, current evidence from Roussolakkos does not support such an early occupation date; instead EM IIA seems more likely as the date of the earliest settlement here, a conclusion reached in the early years of the current campaign5 and supported by more recent finds, as yet unpublished (e.g. in 2003 excavations in Building 7). In absolute terms, this is c. 2650-2450 BC.6 Very few early levels have been found and so the picture may yet change; nonetheless, an EM IIA date is consistent with what is seen at other East Cretan sites such as Myrtos Fournou Korifi, Myrtos Pyrgos, Vasiliki and Gournia,7 and indeed further towards the centre of the island, such as Malia.8 However, we know little of the character of the site of Palaikastro in this earliest phase. The subsequent phase, EM IIB, is rather better represented at Palaikastro, though still not with much architecture, the 'monumental' structure of Block X notwithstanding.9 EM III, MM IA, MM IB and MM II are also all present, though until recently they too have not been very well grasped, not only at Palaikastro but in the east of Crete more generally. Happily, Block M provides us with important new evidence for these relatively little known periods, especially for the Protopalatial period. The evidence consists not only of plentiful ceramic deposits, but also of some architecture, notably rare for these periods. Here we present this new evidence while seeking to situate it within our current understanding of the Prepalatial and Protopalatial periods at the Roussolakkos site of Palaikastro. EM IIIA An important sequence beneath Block A Room 32 revealed EM IIA beneath EM IIB, EM III and MM I in turn.10 This was found in a pocket in the irregular bedrock, and although the pottery was in small pieces, three pots could be restored, 'roughly handmade of a smooth reddish clay, without polish or slip'.11 One is an open-mouthed jug, nearly 20 cm tall, 'with a geometrical decoration of hanging loops in white paint, a decoration found also on incised ware' (a second jug was similar in form but undecorated).12 One would not normally expect white-on-dark decoration in EM IIA, but it is also seen on the third of the vases from this stratum, an askos evidently of EM IIA type.13 Dawkins indeed links these vases to the examples of incised ware that come from the cemeteries. He shows an incised cylindrical pyxis from the Patema ossuary.14 This he says is of grey clay and is badly baked. Another example of what can probably now be labelled Fine Grey Ware,15 comes from the earliest graves on the gravel ridge just to the east of the Roussolakkos site, called 'Tou Galeti He Kephala'. It is a globular jar with vertical lugs at the maximum diameter, made of 'grey-green clay' and decorated with impressed triangles and parallel incised lines.16 Bosanquet mentions that this type is represented 1 PKIV, 260-8. 2 Nowicki 2002, 21. 3 Nowicki 2002, 20. 4 Tsipopoulou 2007; Papadatos 2007. 5 PK Settlement. 6 Momigliano 2007, 7. 7 Watrous 2001, 167. 8 Driessen 20106. 9 Branigan 1970; Driessen 2007. 10 PK III, 200-1; «(/, 4-5. 11 PKIII, 200. 12 Pif///, 201, fig. 3a. 13 PKU, 4, fig. 1. Also note that among the EM IIA sherds was found 'a clay "loom-weight" of a somewhat unusual oval form with a circular seal-impression on one side. The design consists of four spirals converging from the circumference, and closely resembles that engraved on two stones in the Candia Museum, one from Knossos and the other from H. Onouphrios' [PK III, 202). For the loom-weight HMp 4814, see now CMSII.6 no. 239 with further references; cf. ibid. p. 275 for context. 14 PKU, 5, fig. 2.

Dawkins notes comparable incised grey ware from the Ayios Nikolaos rock shelter in the foothills near Modi.17 Dawkins also describes what sounds like EM IIA below Block E, and probably below Room 9, though this is ambiguous: he says 'even earlier habitation is indicated by the discovery at the lowest levels of a few hand-made sherds of grey clay incised with dots and curvilinear designs, of a kind occasionally found in the ossuaries'.18 The 1962-63 excavations uncovered evidence for this earliest period of occupation too, though not at Roussolakkos. Their excavations on Kastri (Trench 3) revealed material probably of EM IIA.19 Further to this, the 2003 campaign discovered a small stratum of what is probably EM IIA beneath Building 7 Room 14, though this is unpublished and thus only preliminarily identified. There is no evidence for EM I or EM IIA in Block M as investigated thus far. This therefore provides us with four pockets of EM IIA habitation at the site, three at Roussolakkos — beneath Block A, Block E and Building 7 — and one on Kastri. These are accompanied by burials in three locations: on the lower south slope of Kastri ('Ta Ellinika'), on the gravel ridge just E of Roussolakkos ('Tou Galeti He Kephala') and in the Patema ossuary, some 500 m to the E of Roussolakkos. We may add to this the evidence from further afield, in the foothills of Modi, for additional EM IIA activity (and indeed Neolithic too). MacGillivray and Driessen suggest that there may just have been two family holdings at this time, one on Kastri and one on the plain, each with their accompanying cemeteries.20 This was, however, based on their identification of EM IIA at Roussolakkos only in A 32. If we consider now A 32 together with Building 7 Room 14 and E g, there are three findspots at Roussolakkos. Are these just three isolated buildings, each roughly 60 m apart? Or was there in fact more continuous settlement between them? This second option is difficult to rule out: the old excavations in Blocks T and B did not go down to bedrock in many places, and the same is true for our excavations in Block M. There may of course be other EM IIA settlement locations in the area of Palaikastro that have yet to be identified, as intensive survey has not been conducted beyond the confines of Roussolakkos. EM IIB This period is also represented by material beneath Block A Room 32, stratified above the EM IIA material mentioned above and below EM III.21 It consisted of a thickly packed stratum 0.15-0.25 cm thick, with sherds of footed goblets, long-beaked jugs, both probably in Vasiliki ware, and of dark-on light jugs (probably Mesara imports?). Dawkins makes connections with pottery from the Ta Ellinika burial enclosures, which clearly contains complete examples of these shapes.22 The connection with finds from both Vasiliki and Knossos is made by Dawkins in ig23-2S Whereas this Block A Room 32 deposit is not associated with any architecture, we do see at this time beneath Block X the earliest signs of a building of significant proportions. Dawkins describes 'the scanty remains of a very large building with very thick walls, belonging to the Early Minoan period, built of small unhewn stones'.24 He goes on to say that Vasiliki ware was found associated with these walls, and links the finds to those from the A 32 level and the ossuary of Ta Ellinika. He further notes that 'these deposits were richest in Rooms 39 and 32, but isolated sherds were common at the lowest level just above virgin soil'.25 The importance of this large building, with walls 2 m wide and 35 m long,26 was further underlined by Branigan, through comparison with large structures appearing in EM IIB at Phaistos, Knossos, Tylissos, Myrtos and Vassiliki.27 Further excavation in Block X in 1962-3 revealed clearly stratified EM IIB strata beneath both Rooms 1 and 4.28 The recent campaign of excavations revealed very little belonging to the EM IIB period. In Building 3, a small sounding below the floor of the E-w corridor in ET 91 unearthed worn scraps of EM IIB Vasiliki ware.29 In Building 7 rather more evidence was brought to light, but again lacking any associated architecture: in Room 12 and Rooms 5-7 and 10.30 17 PKU, 5; see also PKII, 341, figs. 1 and 2. 18 PK III, 211-2. 19 PK VI, 250, 270-1. 20 PK Settlement, 398. 21 PK III, 199-200. 22 PK III, 196-7, and figs. 1, 3b. 23 PKU, 5-7. 24 PKIV, 272-3. 25 PKIV, 273. 26 PKIV, pi.

These are as follows: — Context ib.i: a 'floor' of tightly packed earth and pebbles beneath an MM IIA fill. This produced just one sherd, from a flaring bowl, handmade and probably burnished, in a blackened fabric. — Context 4.1: layer into which MM IIIA foundation cup placed, 10.30T. Contains just a handful of sherds assignable to EM IIB. — Context ga.i: below red plaster floor in stoa, at 10.26?: a handful of Prepalatial sherds, including EM IIB (calcite-tempered wares, rim fragment of a handmade tumbler, rim fragment of a conical bowl with grooved interior rim), but also possible rim of a handmade straight-sided cup of MM IA. — Context StrBM.i: layer below cobbles in street, at 10.30!. Again, just a handful of sherds. — Room 11a: Below the MM IIA fill, a nearly sterile soil, very red, with some sparse EM IIB material at c. 10.30-10.40T. — Room 12b: below c. 10.60T — almost sterile, reddish soil, comparable to level from 11a that is EM IIB; perhaps this is too. This EM IIB evidence comes from a relatively small area of Block M: Rooms 1,9a, 11 and 12 and the B-M Street are all very close to one another in the e of the Southeast Building. Room 4 is a little further away, but still within the Southeast Building. What is also noticeable is that nearly all occur at the same height, at around 10.30-10.40t, indicating perhaps a subsequent levelling operation across a broad terrace; nearly all of the MM IIA fill deposits are found in this area too. When we look at this EM IIB evidence together, we can suggest major changes in both the scale and character of the settlement. The evidence from the recent campaign, from Block M and Buildings 3 and 7, can be combined with that from the earliest excavations to indicate an expansion of the settlement. Furthermore, the architectural evidence from Block X, with what seems to be a substantial structure (35 m long) may even hint at a central building of some kind. This should be taken as an extremely tentative suggestion, but can be considered in the light of recent arguments for Malia and other Minoan sites that see major architectural changes occurring in EM IIB.31 EM III Again, Block A Room 32 provides evidence for this period, stratified over the EM IIB discussed above. The sherds came from 50 cm of earth containing few sherds, and stratified beneath MM I levels. Dawkins illustrates white-on-dark geometric styles which fit well in EM III,32 as represented by Gournia North Trench. Dawkins also illustrates the same wares from sherds found 'deep down in a trial trench that was sunk in the field W of Block 8'.33 Dawkins connects this material also with 41 complete vases found in one of the Ta Ellinika ossuaries in 1905.34 These too seem to represent EM III quite clearly. This burial, MacGillivray and Driessen suggest,35 probably accompanied the large EM III structure on Kastri.36 EM III pottery is also found in Block X, in strata later than the large EM IIB structure. Dawkins states: These deposits were found amongst the Middle Minoan foundations which occupy the centre of the block, and especially in 39, at a higher level than the remains of the large Early Minoan building, though it was not possible to associate them definitely with any set of walls. The richest deposit, 2.50 m thick, was found under the Late Minoan II floor in room 59.37 There is also brief mention of EM III from Block II Room 24: 'a still lower level was reached in 24, and amongst the walls were a few geometrical light-on-dark EM III sherds, the oldest remains found in this region'.38 From recent excavations, we have from Building 5 in a trial in ER 91, beneath what may have been a later stairway, a burnt deposit of EM III/MM I period that includes white-on-dark ware.39 And in 31 E.g. Driessen 2007. 32 PK III, 198, fig. 2. 33 PK III, 198; also mentioned in PKU, 7. 34 PK IV, 269-72; PKU, 7-9. 35 PK Settlement, 399. 36 PK VI, 277, pi. 72b, c. 37 PK III, 273. 38 PKIV, 290. 39 PK 1988, fig. 2, p. 419.</page><page sequence="140">1 io PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN Building 7 Room 12 there are 2 walls associated with clay floors, and covered in EM III pottery.40 This EM III stratum was also identified in 2003 excavations beneath Room 2 in the same building.41 BLOCK M, EM III We have just one context of this period from Block M. Context 64.1 This consists of a deep sounding s of the North Fagade 402 and E of Wall 612, revealing a long sequence which here in zembils #0790 and 0791 comes down to EM III.42 Just because we cannot identify any substantial EM III architecture at Roussolakkos is not to say that there is some kind of recession after EM IIB. We have evidence for EM III from across a number of blocks and buildings, including Blocks A (and outside to w), X and Building 5, not to mention Kastri. This Kastri building is often seen as evidence for a move away from the plain to a defensive location;43 however, not only does the occupation of the plain evidently continue, but Kastri is already occupied from EM IIA. MM IA EM III can be difficult to separate from MM IA on stylistic grounds, even at Rnossos.44 The main difference is that polychrome decoration of red and white on a black ground appears in MM IA. This feature was used with some confidence by the earliest excavators of Palaikastro to distinguish EM III from MM IA layers. The polychrome pottery they present is clearly later than EM III, but tends not to be from well-stratified contexts, much coming from the ossuaries. This leads instead to problems with differentiating between MM IA and the subsequent MM IB. Indeed, a lot of what is presented by Dawkins as MM IA is probably MM IB, if not MM IIA.45 Not all comes from the ossuaries. A polychrome bridge-spouted jug was found beneath Block X Room 18, where MM walls were found.46 In an earlier publication Dawkins seems inclined to link these walls to MM II, so the dating of this jug to MM IA must surely be on stylistic grounds.47 It would seem to belong more probably, however, in MM IB. A floor deposit from Block B Room 40 is also mentioned,48 from which a tall flaring tumbler is illustrated.49 This tumbler does seem MM I, but it is difficult to go much further. While stylistically such vases might clearly be attributed to MM I rather than EM III, thanks to their polychromy, it is much more difficult distinguishing stylistically between MM IA and IB. Fortunately, excavations in 1962-63 and the recent campaign have furnished some stratified remains which do go some way towards alleviating these chronological problems. Of particular use is a floor deposit beneath Block X Room 1, with c. 40 complete and restorable vases, preliminarily described and now published more fully.50 The vases in this well-stratified deposit provide an excellent snapshot of MM IA styles and shapes, with some EM III vestiges, simple polychromy and the first tentative steps towards the use of wheel rotation. They also contrast nicely with what we argue to be an MM IB deposit, in Trench H3 (see below). Thanks to this deposit we can flesh out the picture for MM IA at Palaikastro by linking in much smaller yet well stratified deposits from Building 7 Rooms 2 and 10,51 and Block M. Stylistically we might be in a position to say that there is more MM IA across the site, judging by the pottery styles preserved, but it is difficult to identify particular deposits. Therefore we cannot really comment on the growth or otherwise of the settlement during this period, except to say that occupation continues, and presumably at comparable levels to before. BLOCK M, MM IA Context ga.i Note that this is also mentioned above, under EM IIB. From below a red plaster floor in the stoa, at 10.26!, comes the possible rim of a handmade straight-sided cup of MM IA, together with EM IIB sherds. 40 PK i99i, 129-31, fig. 9. 41 Knappett 2007, 225, fig. 21. 42 While the early excavators talk of EM III, MacGillivray and Driessen in PK Settlement returned to an unseparated EM III/ MM IA, though see Knappett 2007 for arguments in favour of separating them again based on new dating evidence from recent excavations. 43 Watrous 1994, 717. 44 Momieliano iqqi; Momigliano 2007. 45 E.g.

This pottery, all of it coil-built, can be compared with the MM IA floor deposit from Block X Room 1, with its straight-sided cups, goblets and bridge-spouted jars.53 Also notable is the presence of granodiorite fabrics imported from the Mirabello region, a trait that continues into MM II, though such imports are much rarer come the Neopalatial period. 52 PK ND, there referred to as EP87. 53 PK VIII.</page><page sequence="142">112 PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN 1 (9510) goblet, 1 rim fr, fine hard grey buff, handmade, dark band int and ext rim, and dark band at ext lower body too, D. rim c. 7. #5442. 2 (9502) straight-sided cup, slightly convex walls and base, and narrow strap handle, 20%, profile, 1 piece, fine pinkish buff, handmade, brown-black slip all over, Ht 5, D. base 6.5. #5440. 3 (9503) straight-sided cup, slightly convex walls, thick wall where base meets lower body (diagnostic MM IA), 1 base fr, fine orange with thick grey core, handmade, plain int(?), fugitive slip ext, D. base c. 7.8. #5440. 4 (9509) bridge-spouted jar, 5 rim frs, semi-fine soft pale yellow-green buff, handmade, very fugitive surfaces, perhaps slipped, soft carination, D. rim n. #5443. 5 (9511) bridge-spouted jar, offset base, 6 frs. of base, some joining, semi-coarse soft pale yellow-green buff, handmade, plain int and fugitive dark slip ext, D. base 7.6. #5440, 5443. 6 (9507) bridge-spouted jar(?), globular upper body, 1 rim fr. only, hard-fired semi-fine buff, handmade, black slip int rim and ext, with white-on-dark bands and diagonal lines, D. rim c. 11. #5443. 7 (9508) closed vessel, bridge-spouted jar(?), small step to base, 1 base fr. only, semi-fine pale greenish buff, handmade, black slip ext, lapping under base, white-on dark bands, D. base 7.5. #5442. 8 (9504) collared jar, perhaps with side or bridge spout(?), rim fr. only, semi-coarse orange, handmade, black slip just int rim and ext, with white-on-dark decoration of white bands and diagonal lines, D. rim 11. #5440. 9 (9505) deep lekane with thickened and everted rim, 7 joining frs. of rim and body, overfired light grey with black-white grits of granodiorite, thus Mirabello import; handmade, well smoothed int and ext, with dark-on-light band to rim top, D. rim c. 42. #5442. 10 (4604) pithos, large base fr, no edges, coarse orange with many small white and some white-black grits of granodiorite, and hence Mirabello import; handmade, plain. #5442, A 18, SF132. 11 (9501) tripod cooking pot, 1 large base/foot fr, coarse orange brown with varied inclusions, handmade, plain, with smoothed int and very worn ext, D. base c. 18. #5440. 12 (9506) baking plate, relatively thick-walled, 2 non joining rim frs, coarse brown with phyllite inclusions, mould made, plain, wiped upper surface, underside rough, D. rim c. 40. #5442. PROTO PALATIAL PERIOD To separate our discussion into Prepalatial and Protopalatial periods implies a significant shift between MM IA and IB. Indeed, there are some important changes, such as the first consistent use of wheel techniques in pottery production. At sites in central Crete, such as Knossos and Phaistos, we can see a whole host of other changes too, not least in the architecture of the First Palaces. However, at Palaikastro, the shift is not quite so dramatic, partly because MM IB is not particularly well attested. While this could be due to taphonomic and definitional factors, it might equally be attributed to a lack of major occupational change at the site. By the time we reach MM IIA, however, we can see some significant shifts; changes of some magnitude also seem to take place in MM IIA rather than MM IB at neighbouring Petras, where the palace is not constructed in MM IB (as one might expect from central Crete) but in MM IIA.54 Identifying the different sub-phases of MM IB, IIA and IIB within the Protopalatial period has long been particularly challenging in East Crete.55 Yet here we can make some progress in this area. MM IB As we noted above in connection with the MM IA period, the early excavators clearly unearthed MM IB material, even if it is not always accurately identified or differentiated from MM IA on the one hand or MM II on the other. Recent work suggests that MM IB in East Crete is characterised in part by the Alternating Floral style56 and when we look at the old excavations we can see clear examples of this style even if not always linked to MM IB.57 Again, as with MM IA, we need stratified remains in order to identify MM IB more systematically. The 1962 excavation of Trench H3 provides this, although as an accumulated fill rather than a floor deposit it is not nearly as clear as the MM IA from Block X Room 1. As with this latter deposit, the Trench H3 material is discussed and published elsewhere.58 The pottery has excellent examples of Alternating Floral style, clear use of the wheel for small vessels, and even very specific datable items such as diagonal red and white bands, with close parallels from MM IB Knossos, and capsules d'algues decoration, with secure parallels from Malia.59 Thanks to this deposit, we can begin to link in others from the earliest and latest excavations. Trench H3 was actually placed just to the ne of a trench dug in the 1902-06 campaign and named Trench G3. A section of this 'pit' is shown with, at its lowest level, a compact bed of early Kamares sherds.60 Given the ceramic forms that are illustrated from this layer, and with the hindsight afforded by the 1962 Trench H3, it seems this lowest layer may be attributed to MM IB. 54 Tsipopoulou 1999; 2002. 55 Andreou 1978. 56 Floyd 1997. 57 e.g. PKU, pi.

Here, below a later pavement, was a layer (60 cm deep) at the foundation level of the ashlar wall which bounds the room at the w.61 Dawkins here merely mentions finding cups 'of the early cemetery types',62 and provides outline drawings of a small bevelled cup and a carinated cup with weak profile: these are feasibly MM IB (but could just as well be MM IIA). If they really are well connected with the ashlar wall as Dawkins indicates, then this could mark an interesting connection with the earliest evidence for use of the quarries at Ta Skaria, apparently in the Protopalatial period, judging by the masons' marks; MacGillivray and Driessen were only able to note, 'no significant architecture has been found in the town to correspond with the earliest use of the quarries, although there are traces of early ashlar walls in Block B and elsewhere'.63 To this we can add two small MM IB contexts from the recent campaign: one is from Building 7 Room 164 and the other from Block M Room 50, seemingly associated with architecture. One might also mention parallels with MM IB Petras.65 BLOCK M, MM IB This phase is very poorly represented in Block M, perhaps in part because of levelling operations later in the Protopalatial period. One area with a context belonging to this phase is Room 50 in the NW Building; neighbouring rooms such as 45 and 48 do also have early remains, from MM IA and MM IIB. The upper levels in Room 50 (Context 50.3) consist of LM IA material, as indeed is also the case in Rooms 48 and 49. However, as excavation continues down, an MM IB level is encountered in Context 50.1. Context 50.1 Context 50.1 isolates the material directly on the (here patchy) plaster floor level, and is no later than MM IB. It lies beneath Context 50.2 which comprises the accumulation above and does have MM II ceramics. In #5391, a small zembil, we find pottery diagnostic of MM IB: a tumbler with white-on dark decoration, and polychrome (red and white) diagonal lines. #5393 is small and not very diagnostic but could also feasibly belong in MM I. #5394 comes from between Walls 432 and 428 (between Rooms 50 and 48): it contains fragments of polychrome banded ware that are probably MM IB, as well as some calcite-tempered ware, and the base of a handmade jar. Though the evidence here is sparse, there is enough to indicate that we have early walls going back to MM IB, as indeed seems to be the case in Room 45, where they can be pushed back even farther, into MM IA. MM IIA A distinction between MM IIA and IIB has not generally been possible in East Crete due to a lack of stratified deposits,66 in contrast to the situation in central Crete.67 Nonetheless, the first excavators at Palaikastro uncovered a lot of MM II pottery, and a certain amount of architecture. They are often somewhat vague on the architecture, presumably because they only recovered traces beneath later walls, and found it difficult to make much sense of them. They do note, however, that these earlier walls appear to show no connection with what is above them, as if there were a major destruction at the end of MM II and then a rebuilding along new lines in the Neopalatial period. Given the lack of differentiation of MM II, we can only try in some instances to date deposits to MM IIA or B on stylistic grounds. In an early pottery discussion,68 Dawkins places the Kamares cemeteries (two bone enclosures on the gravel ridge;69 Patema) earlier than the town deposits from trench G3, F 22, street outside A 48, early pottery from B 40, and the small coarse flat bottomed jugs from Block O. He goes on to differentiate between two groups, A and B, showing how certain cup types belong with the former and others with the latter.70 Group A types are found in the cemeteries 61 PKUI, 198. 62 As shown in PKII, 302, fig. 1, 1 and 2. 63 PK Settlement, 401. For other possible early ashlar, see the E facade of the Southeast Building of Block M, seemingly associated with an MM IIB construction episode. 64 2003, unpublished, except Knappett 2007, fig. 22. 65 Haggis 2007. 66 Andreou 1978; Mu IV. 67 MacGillivray 2007; Macdonald and Knappett 2007. 68 PKII, 297-8. 69 The so-called 'Kamares bone enclosure' is on a gravel ridge (Tou Galeti He Kephala) which runs s to n through the town area, then bends to E to form the s horn of the harbour (PKI, 390-7). The enclosure is 9.7 x 8.25 m, with parallel subdivisions. It contained over 140 vases, most of which cups (ibid., fig. 7). They do seem MM II, perhaps earlier rather than later? PI. 17.2 is a breccia style hemispherical cup very similar to those seen in MM IIA at Knossos. Also note so-called 'ivory disc', which could be an MM I seal. Also from enclosure is a black steatite prism seal (fig. 14). 70 PKII, 301-4.</page><page sequence="144">ii4 PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN and in trench G3, but not in the other town deposits.71 Some Group B types are found in the cemeteries too, indicating that burials did continue. When we look at the simple illustrations of Group A shapes, we see small bevelled cups, carinated cups with offset bases and tall flaring tumblers. These we have already mentioned in the section above as being potentially datable to MM IB, but we cannot rule out an MM IIA date either based on such limited information. We should probably just recognize that the cemeteries do have a fair amount of MM IB-IIA pottery, and that while there is some material of this date in the early town excavations, it is probably less abundant than the MM IIB material. We shall assume that much of what is described in terms of 'MM' walls beneath later house blocks comes from the end of the MM period. Yet this picture of a limited amount of MM IIA from Roussolakkos has changed dramatically with the recent excavations. First, an important MM II sequence was revealed on the East Facade of Building 7, in square EU 89.72 It consists of a series of trodden clay surfaces, suggesting that this was an open area outside the building throughout its history. The excavators argue that this sequence begins on virgin soil in MM IIA and stretches to LM IA (with Theran ash). The lowest level they call Surface VII 9.40T. This has white-on-dark, wheelmade pottery, relief/impressed tripod stands (common in MM II at Palaikastro), a large oval-mouthed amphora73 and a large jug with reserved triangles in large black circles at the shoulder. A carinated cup and a white-flecked juglet are taken to suggest a date in MM IIA.74 Above this lies Surface VI at 9.75T. The associated pottery includes white-on-dark tumblers, carinated cups and bevelled cups, with motifs suggestive again of MM IIA.75 The shapes and styles appear to be broadly consistent with what is found in the early cemeteries. Stratified between Surfaces VI and V is pottery transitional between MM IIA and IIB.76 There are some decorative features that can be linked to MM IIA, but also now we see hemispherical and straight-sided cups as new features. We will continue discussing this sequence later, as the next surface belongs with MM IIB.77 BLOCK M, MM IIA Until recently this sequence of MM IIA surfaces was rather isolated at Palaikastro: its definition of MM IIA did not seem very secure in the absence of any supporting evidence. However, continuing work on the extensive Block M material has shown that pottery of the same type is very common, found principally in very large, homogeneous fills beneath the E end of the Southeast Building, particularly under floors in Rooms 1, 10, 11 and 12. Contexts ia.i-ia.2 Wall 711 separating Rooms 1a and lb, and its associated paving, are MM 11(A), according to the pottery lying on the paving. In the w side of Room 1 a we find a substantial MM II fill, enough to cover c. ten 1x2m tables. It is not catalogued here as the material is of the same character as the fills found throughout the E side of the Southeast Building, and of which that from Room 1 b documented below is typical. Context ib.2 (figs. 4.2-4.5) A fill comparable to that from Room 1a is also found in Room lb, stratified beneath a plaster floor, and containing a very large amount of pottery, mostly quite well preserved though with few joins (Context ib.2). The total count from zembils #6629-33 alone was 5,462 sherds, weighing in at 105.6 kg, from 0.8 m3 of fill. There is nothing in this pottery that is as early as MM IA or B (or anything earlier); there is not a single piece of Alternating Floral Style, which certainly seems to be a key MM IB diagnostic feature and which is found in Trench H3.78 There are also few of the features identified by Haggis as MM IB from the nearby site of Petras.79 On the other hand, it does not seem particularly comparable to the extensive MM IIB deposits from Quartier Mu at Malia, the nearest and fullest material for comparison.80 Moreover, some of the features identified in the Building 7 fagade sequence 71 Note how in 1902 the excavation of House A on the cliff south of the promontory was undertaken in the hope of finding more of this early Kamares material in settlement contexts. The belief that House A might yield MM material, which turned out to be mistaken, was fuelled by the discovery nearby of a room that revealed well preserved Kamares pots apparently contemporary with the Kamares bone enclosure on the gravel ridge [PK I, 306). 72 PK i99i. 73 PK 1991, pi. 6c. 74 PK 1991, fig. 10, 1 and 2 respectively. 75 PK 1991, fig. 11. 76 PK 1991, fig. 12. 77 Note also the deposit from Building 7, Room 1, Test 4, excavated in 2003 and unpublished. 78 PK V1II\ see also Floyd 1997 on this style and east Cretan MM IB. 79 Haggis 2007. 80 Mu IV</page><page sequence="145">BLOCK M IN THE PREPALATIAL AND PROTOPALATIAL PERIODS 115 as MM IIB are also not present, such as straight-sided cups with bevelled bases.81 The MM IIA part of the Building 7 sequence contained tumblers and bevelled cups, both of which are, however, well represented in the Room lb fill deposit, with similar white-on-dark motifs too. Also common are small carinated cups with offset bases and white-on-dark decoration: note that these are not present in either the Petras MM IB deposit or the MM IIB Quartier Mu deposits. Straight-sided cups are almost absent too, again in contrast to MM IIB. A technological feature worth emphasising is that the bases of small wheelmade cups tend to have parallel striations showing from their removal from the wheel, in contrast to the concentric striations that tend to be more common in MM IIB. A few local peculiarities are worthy of mention. One type that occurs over and over again in these fills, albeit not a common shape, is the low square tray (65-67). Often slipped, but with no other decoration, and in some instances with pierced rims, these trays have neither an obvious function, nor any parallels from other Cretan MM II assemblages. A second feature to highlight is the local proclivity in this period for various kinds of appliqué, although they are most commonly encountered on the interior of tripod braziers (73, 75), which are also in some instances 'reed' impressed (74). Parallels do exist for these kinds of tripod brazier, for example at Myrtos-jPyrgos.82 The appliqués are often rather amorphous, although it is tempting to label them 'sheep' by analogy with the well-known example from Palaikastro: a polychrome rounded bowl with an appliqué interior of a herd of nearly 160 animals facing a herdsman.83 This piece is attributed to MM I by Dawkins on stylistic grounds. The use of multiple, indeed hundreds, of appliqué attachments inside an open vessel is seen here too in striking form with the kantharos 31, though in this case the attachments are tiny round rings. There are stylistic grounds, therefore, for assigning this fill to MM IIA. Stratigraphically all we can say is that it is above EM IIB and below LM IA. Nowhere in Block M do we have MM IIA stratified directly beneath MM IIB or above MM IB, and this is a limitation that we have to acknowledge. We are of course also hamstrung by a lack of comparative material in east Crete for this phase, but we should say that we are dealing with something that sits between MM IB and IIB, and IIA seems the most convenient label in pan-Cretan terms. In our local site chronology, this will require the splitting of Period VII into Vila (MM IIA) and Vllb (MM IIB). Nonetheless, the stylistic picture from a range of deposits, both at Palaikastro and at other sites, does seem quite consistent. Furthermore, the Room lb fill does not sit alone: there are a number of other fill deposits from the same part of the building which tell almost exactly the same story, as we will see in due course below. *3 (9569) conical tumbler, 1 piece, 40%, profile, semi fine orange with grey core, handmade and rim may have some rotation finishing, plain, Ht 6.6, D. rim 9, D. base 4. #6629. 14 (9570) conical tumbler, slight flare to rim, 3 joining frs, profile, 40%, semi-fine orange with grey core, handmade with lumpy lower body, some rotation finishing at upper, plain, Ht 6.6, D. rim 9.5, D. base 4.3. #6629. 15 (9558) conical tumbler, 1 piece, profile, c. 15%, fine buff, wheelmade, black slip all over, Ht 5.8. #6630. *6 (9573) tumbler, 1 base fr, fine pale buff, handmade(?), black slip all over and white spiral and band, D. base 3.5. #6631. 17 (9544) flaring tumbler, 1 rim sherd, fine pale buff, handmade with coil seam at int, dark slip int rim and ext body, white-on-dark decoration, D. rim 8. #6630. 18 (9455) tall flaring tumbler, one base fr fine orange, wheelmade, black slip ext but plain int; white-on-dark bands ext, D. base 4. #6628. ig (9577) goblet, 1 rim fr, fine orange, hm?, slip int rim only and all ext, with white diagonal lines from rim. #6630. 20 (9555) footed goblet(?), 1 base fr, soft fine yellow, red-brown slip all over, with white dots around base, under base and inside, D. base 4.2. #6630. 21 (8836) conical cup, complete and 1 piece, semi-fine to semi-coarse orange-brown, plain, wheelmade, Ht 3.6, D. rim 7.7, D. base 3.8.

MM IIA pottery from Context ga.2. Catalogue number 87. Context ga.2: stoa The 'Stoa trial' in the sw corner of Room ga came down upon an MM II fill lying above a red-orange plaster floor beneath the slabs of the stoa. The pottery is much more worn than the relatively fresh MM IIA pottery from the fills beneath Rooms 1,10 and 11. Nonetheless, the pottery is seemingly of the same date, with diagnostic features such as tumblers, one with white-on-dark spiral motifs just like that on 16 in Context ib.2\ and fragments of ribbed carinated cups and a ribbed carinated bridge spouted jug (fig. 4.6). The MM IIA date of this pottery thus provides a terminus post quem for the slabs, suggesting that they were laid in MM IIB at the earliest. One interesting piece catalogued here is 87, a ceramic imitation of a triton shell (fig. 4.6). This seems to be one of the earliest examples of such a type.84 We also note that the small quantities of pottery beneath the red plaster floor, from Context ga.i, consist of Prepalatial material, seemingly ranging from EM IIB to MM IA. This then indicates that the plaster floor may have been laid in MM IB, as a similar floor in Rooms 48-50; there one portion of the floor seems to have stayed in use (Context 48.1) while the other had only MM IB pottery in the layer on the floor itself (Context 50./) 87 (9052) triton shell vessel, x fr towards narrow end, slip to ext, plain int, this piece has two thick rounded ridges, fine soft orange buff, manufacture unclear, dark red-brown L 6, W 5. #6530, [48], A 5.

Pottery found against Wall 607 (in #2889) and on this surface includes a base of a gently flaring tumbler that has a black slip on the exterior only; there is not much pottery, but what there is belongs in MM 11(A). Pottery from the cleaning of Wall 607 appears MM II as well. From the w side of Room 12b, between Walls 611 and 614, #2811 yielded a stone tool, stone vessel fragments and a loomweight. Other parts of the room produce more pottery from this context, a whole 1 m x 2 m table in some cases, and it again is MM 11 A. Note also to the E of Wall 835 we find diagnostic MM IIA pottery: a white-spotted bridge-spouted jar rim; a white-slipped saucer rim fragment; a handmade, polychrome convex cup base; a profile of a hemispherical cup; the base of a straight-sided cup; fragments of imported Mirabello pithoid jar(s).

Context 12 b. 2 Immediately above the hard surface and material of Context i2b.i lies Context 12b.2, a substantial MM IIA fill. The date assigned to the pottery provides a terminus post quern for the laying of a plaster floor throughout Room 12b. In this context the fill was undisturbed by later pits. On the w side of the room between Walls 611 and 607 in #2806 there are some features, such as a carinated cup fragment, which point to a date in MM IB—II. #2808 continues down over the same w part of the room to the clay surface s of Wall 611 and reveals Wall 614. The pottery, though meagre, includes tumbler bases, and is perhaps MM I—II. #2810 is from the same area again, below #2808. Again, the pottery is consistent with MM IIA. Context 12b.5 From a niche or bench cut into Wall 614, an early version of Wall 607. A small quantity of pottery includes a wheelmade tumbler and a cup base with white-on-dark, consistent with early MM II. This could be a remnant of earlier architecture belonging to MM IB or MM IIA.

Contexts 12b.7, 12b.11 and 12b.12 (fig. 4.9) We also see a number of contexts in which MM IIA is mixed with LM IA, due to pits dug into the MM IIA fill during LM IA. Context 12b.7 has a little MM IIA admixture; 12b.11 does too, with fragments of carinated cups, bichrome amphora, imported Mirabello amphora with dark-on-light and a white-slipped jar base. However, the main concentration of MM IIA pottery is from the tephra pit Context 12b. 12, by far the largest of the pits. The pit was dug late in LM IA through earlier floor levels and into the thick MM IIA fill. Many of the zembils contain substantial amounts of MM IIA; one of them (#2901) covers 1/2 a table with predominantly MM IIA pottery, including tumblers, applique 'sheep' on the inside of bowls, a carinated bridge-spouted jug fragment, white-on-dark carinated cup, a unique double cup, and a unique half-and-half white slip/brown slip jug/jar base (see plate 18). Another zembil, #6786, covers a whole table, among which the MM II material has some unique pieces (see catalogue) and a join with #6795, forming the mouth of a beaked jug (98, with joins to Context 12b.1). #6787 is a 1/3 of a table, and includes the white-on-dark flecked tumbler, 92 (with very close parallels from H3 lower level, cat no. 90 in PK VIII). 92 (7911) conical tumbler, 75% with excellent surface preservation, fine buff, wheelmade, black slip in and out with white painted decoration in and out too: spirals at int and band and stripe at ext with splash decoration; thin white band under base too; Ht 5.4, D. rim c. 9, D. base 3.6. #6787. 93 (8279) carinated cup, 10%, 2 frs of rim and handle, very fine buff, wheelmade, polychrome and barbotine: barbotine pricks along carination; D. rim c. 10. #6787. 94 (8276) ribbed carinated cup, 10%, 2 joining body frs, fine buff with lustrous black slip and ribbing and embossing above carination; D. max c. 13. #6786. 95 (8272) bevelled cup, 20%, profile, 3 frs, fine orange, wheelmade, lustrous black slip with polychrome decoration: one white band at lower body, thick diagonal red band with white band below and 2 white bands above.

Excavation throughout the room revealed MM IIA levels beneath later occupation material. In the centre of the room, for example, a probable MM IIA wall running diagonally n to s was found, and a wall at right angles at the s side of the trench. Dating evidence (#6601, 6603-04) includes parallel-striated tumblers unslipped at the interior; parallel-striated carinated cups with footed base; plain conical tumblers with parallel striations; white on-dark bevelled cups; and a tasse tronconique with white-on-dark pendent festoons at the interior rim (cf. Mu IV, MM II). What pottery there is belongs in the early Protopalatial, i.e. MM IIA. The same MM IIA pottery is also found in the E and SE of the room. Context 18.1 This concerns the small walls, 617 and 618 that are on a rather different alignment to the Southeast Building. #3545-49 all are MM IIA, comparable to the material above. So perhaps Walls 617 and 618 are associated with MM IIA; though no floor is found (despite going down to lo.oot), they may indeed go back earlier. It is noted that they are earlier than Wall 610. Context 18.2 (fig. 4.10) This context consists primarily of MM II material just to the N of Wall 611, though with some admixture of LM IA from the large robbing pit on Wall 611. #2776 has pottery that does seem consistent with MM IIA: lots of white-on-dark decoration, tumbler bases, rectangular dark-slipped trays, and bevelled cups. #2794 has barbotine, and a tumbler base. #2795 also contains MM II material, notably 100, a handlamp. #2796 has 1/2 table of pottery which is largely MM 11(A): barbotine with black slip on a closed vessel; dark-slipped hemispherical cups, dark-slipped cup bases, and offset bases with parallel striations. #2797 and 2839 are the same, with a square tray, offset cup bases, and bevelled cup bases, as seen in Room lb. #3532-33 and 3536-38 are from the E of wall 610, and here too the material is consistent with MM IIA.

MM IIA SUMMARY The MM IIA fills presented here are strongly suggestive of a single filling operation all across this part of the Block, presumably as part of a major construction phase. Using this fill as a terminus post quem, and assuming that the building activity happened very soon after its laying down, we can argue for a major building phase at the start of MM IIB. This would mean dating the laying of the plaster floors above the fills to this period, though we have no direct positive date for this, and the best terminus ante quem we have generally is the LM IA pottery overlying these floors. Yet we do have more direct evidence for MM IIB activity in association with the drains in this part of the building (see below). This is relatively scanty though, and it is intriguing that we have little sign of an MM IIB destruction of the building: perhaps because it underwent a major cycle of rebuilding in MM IIIA (see below).</page><page sequence="156">126 PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN MM IIB As already mentioned, the early excavators came down upon a lot of MM II, but it was largely not possible to tell between MM IIA and B. MacGillivray and Driessen suggest that in MM IB/IIA 'there are sufficient walls and pottery deposits beneath Blocks X, G, E and O to suggest that a proper town seems to have emerged'.87 Yet they also note that for MM IIB/IIIA (which here we call simply MM IIB) 'floor deposits are reported under Blocks Delta and Xi and a maze of early walls beneath the main town seem to belong to this period'.88 They do not, however, indicate how these two phases are differentiated. Let us now consider the evidence block by block. Starting with Block B, the first to be excavated, we see on the plan that some 'earlier walls at lower level' are marked out, but little additional information is provided.89 Further work was conducted in 1903, when it became clear that the nw part of the block had been robbed out, but it also made material from lower levels more accessible, and produced a quantity of early pottery, including a Kamares fruitstand.90 In PKII the plan again shows early walls in Block B. At the w end of Room 13, for example an early wall was exposed, made of 'well-finished small ashlar coated with white plaster',91 and in all likelihood MM II. Furthermore, Room 40 contained 'a remarkable deposit of 59 small Kamares vases', including bridge-spouted jugs, beaked jugs, tumblers and cups.92 Mention is also made of a fragment of a Kamares fruitstand from Room 40, of a type also found in T 22.93 This at Malia is known as a compotier, where it is found in MM IIB, although also earlier.94 In Block T early walls are indicated below Rooms 27-29 in the PK //plan. No further detail is forthcoming though. The only mention of earlier material is in relation to Room 22, which was 'extremely fertile in fine Kamares ware, which was found immediately above the virgin soil'.95 It is probably a fill, somewhat disturbed, and contains two examples of Kamares fruitstands, one complete,96 as well as two plain black eggshell ware fragments. As noted above, these compotiers can occur at Malia in MM IIB, but also earlier; the polychrome decoration of that shown in figure 8 could certainly be MM IIA. It is very hard to say, therefore, whether the Y 22 deposit should be placed earlier or later in MM II. For Block A, mention is made of 'an earlier house' with walls beneath Rooms 1, 7 and 10.97 Also the street to the E of the Block, notably outside Rooms 16 and 48, contained a great deal of Kamares pottery, 'contemporary with that from the cemeteries'.98 This is later described as a fill.99 There is perhaps then reason to place this rather with MM IIA. Also in Block A we read that 'the main feature of the earlier house was the megaron' (Room 19).100 Other traces of this early house are also found nearby. Dawkins links the different phases of the house to different levels in the Street: note that a trial by Hatzaki close by in Main Street discovered 4 phases of paving from MM to LM II IIIA.101 Although difficult to connect, the Block A phasing may link to that of Hatzaki's street sequence. In Block E, there are 'scanty remains' of MM II houses beneath Rooms 29-35 an&lt;^ Rooms 36-43.102 A clumsily-made, tall Kamares amphora was found beneath Room 32. Also in connection with Block E, traces of an 'early road facing Block O' are also described: 'we reached a very ancient road-surface buried in deep rubbish among which were Kamares vases; it was paved with rounded cobbles, closely set ..,'103 For Block 5, the excavators are explicit that no MM II walls existed in the ne part (Rooms 20-25), suggesting the area was not occupied by any building at this time.104 There are MM house remains though between Rooms 20 and 1, where a hoard of vases of what Dawkins describes as MM II was found, made up of 48 complete vases, of which 1 o Vaphio cups.105 Dawkins links these to late Kamares, i.e. MM IIB, and associates them with other MM deposits found beneath later floors in this block and connected with early walls. While certain vases of various shapes resemble those from the cemeteries (and thus presumably thought to pre-date MM IIB), such as a small basket-shaped cup, and some small bowls supported by three legs, there are also vases evidently later in date: even a ripple Vaphio cup, 87 PK Settlement, 399-401. 88 PK Settlement, 403. 89 PK I, 310-16. 90 PK II, 278. 91 PKII, 287. 92 PKII, 289. 93 PKII, 308. 94 Mu IV, cat. 1153. 95 PKII, 291. 96 PKII, 307-8, fig. 8. 97 PKII, 292-3. 98 PKII, 293. 99 PKII, 304 100 PKII, 293. 101 PK 1994/6, 262-4. 102 PKII, 295. 103 PKII, 278. 104 PK III, 209. 105 PK III, 210.</page><page sequence="157">BLOCK M IN THE PREPALATIAL AND P ROTO PALATIAL PERIODS 127 which must be at least MM IIIA. There are also what sound like two bowls with featherwave decoration, and another with both ripple and featherwave. Dawkins further describes a bowl of very fine eggshell ware, with white wavy lines and circles of white dots. Given our current knowledge, the latest material here is MM III, perhaps MM IIIA, or even MM IIIB.106 Dawkins says that a few other examples of what are presumably featherwave were found under the floors in this block, e.g. below the N wall of Room 2, and that 'several other floor deposits were found belonging to the Middle Minoan walls'.107 Among these Dawkins mentions only the deposit in Room 9, in the nw corner of the block, which he claims 'comprised cups like those of the earlier "Class A" ware from the ossuaries' (that is to say, MM IB or IIA). The picture for Block S is thus a little confused, but does seem to indicate that MM IIA, IIB, and probably MM III structures exist in this area, albeit not in the area of Rooms 20-25. In Block n the scanty remains of an MM house were found beneath two houses, at Rooms 7-16 and 17-22.108 A trace of this early house is left in a deposit of vases found below the later walls in Room 17. Dawkins here emphasizes that the MM walls 'have no connexion with what lies above them', also noting that this is true of most parts of the town where MM walls have been found.109 He suggests that this fits with Evans's idea at Rnossos of a great catastrophe at the end of the MM II period. Dawkins makes a similar assertion in relation to Block X.110 He describes a network of walls between two LM II houses and associated with MM pottery. Most was fragmentary, but a rich deposit was revealed at the w end of Room 18. It is here that Dawkins states: This stratum brings us to the time of some great changes at Palaikastro, when the ossuaries went out of use, and the town was largely rebuilt; a deduction from the fact that in many places in the town where Middle Minoan pottery is found, the associated walls stand in no connexion with those above them.111 Dawkins adds one further observation: the MM predecessor of House X 1-17 can be plainly seen in the plan to block the course of the later street which he states was only opened after the MM period. This tells us that the MM II street must have taken a different course, and that the rebuilding in the Neopalatial period was sufficiently substantial to require the adjustment of street courses. Returning to the recent excavations, we can pick up the story of the sequence outside the Building 7 facade where we began in the section on MM IIA above. Surfaces VII and VI were attributed to MM IIA, but Surface V (at 9.92T) belongs in MM IIB: it has fragments of true central Cretan Kamares ware, a polychrome bevelled straight-sided cup typical of MM IIB at Knossos.112 There is also a tiny fragment of true eggshell ware. Surface IV, at lo.oot, with pottery similar to that on surface V, included more imported pieces.113 It too contains typical MM IIB types and decoration, including eggshell. But there are also plain shallow bowls, one with a ledge rim and the other more saucer-like, suggestive of MM IIIA. Although not directly relevant to our current focus on the Protopalatial period, we may further note that Surface III (at 10.14?) consisted of a very shallow deposit of fragmentary and mostly undiagnostic pottery: stratigraphically we can say little more than this is MM III. Surface II (at 10.24?) an^ Surface I (at 10.46T) are of MM IIIB/LM IA date; stratified at Surface I and cutting down into Surface II was an 8 cm lens of grey volcanic ash, with LM IA pottery. Just to the N of this sequence at the facade of Building 7 lies Building 3, where a test made in the SE part of the se corner room revealed MM II remains.114 Below a LM IIIA2/B pebble floor was a burnt layer overlaying a clay floor. Associated with the clay floor was LM IIIAi pottery. Below the clay floor was a floor of blue-black pebbles of uncertain date. Below this was a layer of foundation and construction debris 0.20 m thick, containing very fragmentary pottery of MM II. This is taken to confirm the MM II date of Building 3, suggested by its layout and megalithic facade. Excavation along the NW fagade of Building 4 was conducted in 2003 with a view to dating the construction of the building. Although rather scrappy, the latest material at the lowest levels appears to date to MM IIB, which suggests a construction date for the building at the beginning of the Neopalatial period, i.e. in MM IIIA. Block M provides important new data for the MM IIB period at Palaikastro, which is now fully presented. 106 PK 2003, 172. 107 PK III, 811. 108 PKIIl 212-14. 109 PK III, 213. 110 PKIV.; 274. 111 PK IV, 274. 112 PK 1991, fig- 13; MacGillivray 1998. 113 PK 1991, fig. 14. 114 PK 1991, 123.</page><page sequence="158">PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN Fig. 4.11. MM IIB pottery from Context ioa.i. Catalogue number 101. BLOCK M, MM IIB As noted above, Block M provides important new MM IIB evidence, both in terms of construction, including well-built drains and a foundation deposit, and also in terms of stratified contexts beneath MM IIIA levels. Some of these discoveries have been briefly mentioned in preliminary reports, but we will in some cases be referring to them here using different terms. Room ioa (Context ioa.i includes foundation deposit) (fig. 4.11) The preliminary report describes from 'Room Ri' a carinated bridge-spouted jug of a type very well known at Malia in MM IIB, "apparently set as a foundation deposit beneath the east wall in the space".115 Its character as a foundation deposit is further described in a subsequent paper: it was set the right way up with a pithos sherd for a lid.116 101 (6400) small carinated bridge-spouted jug, fine buff, wheelmade, dark slip exterior, Ht 13.2, D. rim 9.6, D. base 6. #4579. Room 10b: drain The well-built drain in this room is first described in the preliminary report.117 It heads off diagonally sw to NE in the direction of Room 12 a, where two drains meet and exit the building into the street at the same point; this, together with their similar and substantial construction, indicates that they should be contemporary. The room 12a drain can be dated to MM IIB (see below), which means that this Room 10b drain should also be the same date. However, while the associated pottery can be assigned to MM II, it is difficult to specify that it is MM IIB rather than earlier. In the preliminary report, the excavators suggest that 'the drain was silted in during MM II, and should be contemporary with the architecture and floor found in EQand ER 87'.118 These latter contexts are Rooms 48 and 52 (see below), which indeed ought also to belong to MM II. But now that we can subdivide MM II into A and B, there is some question as to whether the Room 10b and Rooms 48 and 52 are strictly contemporary. Context 10b.2: Protopalatial deposit above drain (#4375-76, 4380-82) MM II(A?) pottery is found relatively high up, as soon as the walls begin to reveal themselves, though at these higher levels there is still some LM IA pottery mixed with the MM II. #4374 is w of Wall 530, N of wall 535, and the plaster found attached to the wall suggests an interior space. By #4375 we are already into pure Protopalatial, with a few of the offset bases characteristic of MM IIA. #4376 is lower down in the same space. The soil is much sandier and softer, and contains around 1/2 table of exclusively MM IIA pottery, similar in date to the fills found all across this side of the building. There are very few profiles, a little decoration visible on dark-slipped carinated and hemispherical cups, bridge-spouted jars, but interestingly very few straight-sided cups. This pattern continues in zembils below where the drain eventually appears. #4380 produced almost a whole table of pottery, some 115 PK 1994/6, 239. 116 MacGillivray et al. 1999; cat. 6400, pi.

Note 102, a fragment of a plat a barbe seemingly related to the low rectangular dishes common in MM II (of which, though, none occurs in these zembils). The pattern is continued in #4381 — a small to medium zembil with more MM II — and then #4382, which hits a new 'wall' 544, which turns out to be one side of the drain (filled with waterborne silt). This too contains MM II pottery, though not very diagnostic. Thus the three walls surrounding the Room 10b drain, 542, 535 and 530, all seem datable to MM II, though we cannot say whether MM IIA or IIB from the pottery. It was apparently already out of use by the end of the MM IIB period; there was certainly no MM IIIA pottery present in or around the drain. In this it clearly contrasts with the Room 12a drain, which does continue in use into MM IIIA and probably also MM IIIB. Why should this be the case? It may be that the alignment of the Room 10b drain was a hangover from an earlier MM I or IIA structure (fig. 4.12). 103 (3216) plat a barbe. a curved low dish, fine buff, wheelmade, black slip all over, 13.2 length, 8.4 width, Ht 2.8. #4380, SFg. Context iob.i: material inside drain At #4385 the bottom of the drain is reached, but the zembil contains very little diagnostic material. Room 12a As mentioned in the account of Room 10b above, the drain in Room 12a connects to the Room xob drain at Street B-M. This drain is well-built and was subject to rather more remodelling than was that of Room 10b. Diagnostic pottery comes from Contexts 12a. 1-5, which includes the soil just above the slabs lining the bottom of the drain. As a whole these contexts provide a good basis for assigning the construction of the drain to MM IIB, working from the pottery found inside the drain itself. We may also take into account the substantial MM IIA fills from the surrounding area, laid down after a levelling episode and in advance, presumably, of major construction activity; this most likely occurred in MM IIB. There is continued use of the drains into MM III, with some further activity in the area in LM IA. Context 12a. 1 (#2899) #2899 was excavated just above the slabs that line the bottom of the drain. The pottery in this unit is MM II, and includes a carinated cup (with a join to #2898), fragments of tall handled conical cups as found in MM IIB Quartier Mu at Malia,119 and a miniature tripod cooking pot. Context 12a.2 (#2895, 2897-98) This is also a unit, like Context 12a. 1, from the soil above the slabs in the drain. The zembils are #2895, 2897 and 2898; note the carinated cup join between #2898 and #2899 mentioned above. #2898 has a tiny amount of pottery, and is hard to date, but could well be MM II given this join. #2897 comes down upon the slabs at the bottom of the drain. A small juglet (SF79, uncatalogued) 119 Mu IV.</page><page sequence="160">130 PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN was actually sitting on these slabs, though it is difficult to date. More diagnostic is the fragment of a featherwave bowl, and a piece of a hemispherical cup with a groove below the rim; there are also fragments of a Mirabello amphora, a plain carinated cup, a bridge-spouted jar and another hemispherical cup. Taken together they provide good evidence that we are here dealing with a body of MM IIB pottery, with a possibility (given the plain carinated cup) that it could go into early MM IIIA. This fits well with the idea of the drain being already in use in MM II, and continuing in use into MM III. This is seen also in #2895 which contained MM II material but also ledge-rim bowl fragments, and a possible S-profile conical cup, more normally associated with MM IIIB. Context 12a.3 (#6796-97) A terracotta drain channel was found in the E part of the drain: it was clearly a later modification, set well above the original stone lining. The zembils in question are #6796-97. The former includes SF67, the rim of a white-on-dark straight-sided cup, probably of late MM II. The latter (#6797), a small zembil, also has material assignable to MM I—II, such as a plain flaring saucer, the neck of a black-slipped fine jar, and a fragment of a Mirabello amphora/pithoid jar with dark diagonal band; however, there is also SF68, a complete ledge-rim bowl of MM III type. This provides a terminus post quem for the laying of the terracotta drain, perhaps an event that took place during MM IIIB along with other architectural modifications in the building. Context 12CL.4 (#6788, 6792-93) This context comprises the eastern end of the drain where its cover slabs were intact. The zembils are #6788, 6792 and 6793. #6788 contains only very worn and scrappy material, largely undatable, except for fragments of a ripple straight-sided cup which could be assigned to either MM IIIA or B. #6792 is a small zembil with scrappy pottery, among which are two very worn base fragments of a straight-sided cup with fugitive dark slip, probably late MM II. #6793 is another small zembil, very worn, but one body sherd could go with the straight-sided cup noted for #6792. This again might hint tentatively at a late MM II date. Context 12(1.5 (#2892-94) This context consists of zembils from higher up in the w end of the drain, from which the cover slabs were robbed out (in contrast to Context 120.4). As with those parts of the drain described above, there are still indeed MM II sherds; but there is also later material from the robbing of the cover slabs. #2892 includes a miniature cup (very small, consistent with MM II, SF76), and a conical cup (SF77) that looks MM III. There are also sherds with dark-on-light wavy patterns that could belong in LM IA. Much the same story holds for #2893 and #2894. Context 12b. 6 As was described earlier in the MM IIA section, we have plentiful MM IIA contexts from Room 1 2b, albeit cut in many occasions by LM IA pits. These MM IIA contexts are mostly fill laid down as part of early MM IIB construction, such as the laying of a plaster floor. Context 12b.6 comes from on this plaster floor, running along Wall 609/611 and Bench 608, up against this wall. The zembils are #2793, 2905, and 2842-43. #2793 has a mixture of pottery, including both MM (e.g. two sherds of lustrous black eggshell ware, and a hemispherical cup fragment), and LM I. #2842 and 2843 are tiny zembils, and the former includes LM IA (conical cup). Context 16a. 1 (fig. 4.13) MM IIB pottery comes from #5766-72 and #6605-14; the material, potentially 'builders' debris', underlies Walls 722 and 723 and so may provide a terminus post quem for a construction event in early MM IIIA. The pottery includes a number of restorable vessels, catalogued below. Some of these are types that one might expect to find in either MM IIA or IIB, such as 105, a wheelmade tall flaring tumbler with red-brown slip; 103, a black-slipped conical tumbler, with parallel striations under the base; or 107 a plain, low carinated cup with parallel striations. Other features which would be perfectly at home in MM IIA include carinated cups with offset bases (from #6609), and white-slipped saucers, (from #6610) which are seen in the MM IIA fills beneath the Southeast Building, though also found in the MM IIB levels of Quartier Mu.120 However, a number of features are really much more at 120 MuIV</page><page sequence="161">BLOCK M IN THE PREPALATIAL AND P ROTO PALATIAL PERIODS Fig. 4.13.

These are 105, a conical tumbler in fine buff with dark slip and white pendent festoons at interior rim;121 a carinated bridge-spouted jug with white-on-dark bands (110), of the same shape as that in the foundation deposit of Room 10a; straight-sided cups, one bevelled (108) and one with straight base edge (120), both types that are extremely rare in the aforementioned MM IIA fills. A final noteworthy feature is the very fine bowl with tooled ledge-rim and decoration at the interior of what seems to be featherwave (122), a motif that does not occur before MM IIB. This decorative style is seen at Malia and Myrtos-Pyrgos in MM IIB,122 and continues into MM III (at Palaikastro), often in association with tortoiseshell ripple.

Main Street If we argue that the construction of the drains took place in MM IIB with continued use into MM IIIA, and that Street B-M also sees its first surface laid down and in use in MM IIB and IIIA, then the question presents itself: does this mean we can also identify a contemporary street surface in Main Street? One would assume so. In an attempt to answer this we may turn to a trial made across Main Street at the S Façade of Building 6.123 What it revealed at its lowest levels (excavated within the gutter at the s side of the street) was an early paving of green schist slabs (11.18T) associated with MM pottery (presumably MM II?). Hatzaki notes that this paving is at the same level as the foundation course of the North Façade of Block A (quite feasibly built in MM II).124 This might also go with the evidence for construction in Block M (i.e. drains) in MM IIB. Above this is what Hatzaki calls the 'early sandstone paving' (11.51t), which has Neopalatial pottery above it and a layer of Theran tephra, 2-5 cm thick and sandwiched between layers of silt, at 11.35Î in the accompanying drain. This provides a terminus ante quem for its construction in LM IA; however, it might have been built as early as MM IIIA, and been in constant use, if we consider the construction date of the neighbouring 121 MM IIB Quartier Mu, see Mu IV. 122 Mu IV.; Knappett 1997. 123 Hatzaki, PK 1994/6, 262-4. 124 see PK II, 292-4.</page><page sequence="163">BLOCK M IN THE PREPALATIAL AND PROTOPALATIAL PERIODS !33 SE Building (for more on this, see Chapter 3). Subsequent to this are two further street levels, one of purple schist paving (11.64?) datable to LM IB, and then a final sandstone paving and drain, the present surface, dating to LM II—III (11.88T). Context 45.2 (fig. 4.14) Moving to the NW Building of Block M, here too we find some traces of MM IIB occupation. The main among these is in Room 45, and is particularly significant in being neatly stratified beneath MM IIIA. This is one of the few locations where we have MM IIB and IIIA in good stratigraphic relationship. Beneath the MM IIIB closet destruction at Context 45.4 (published as 'EP87' in 2003) there is a very good stratified sequence of MM IIIA (Context 45.3), MM IIB (Context 45.2) and MM IA (Context 45.1), the last associated with early walls (see the MM IA section above). Here we deal with the MM IIB Context 45.2. This is with #5426, we find 1/4 1x2m table of pottery with MM II, but some intrusive LM I and possibly even LM III. The catalogued pieces include 140, a small rhyton jar with perforated base, and a large conical bowl or 'kalathos' too (141). #5429 is a small zembil which is MM II, and this pattern continues with #5430-32, #5434, #5436 and #5438. #5430-31 are medium zembils, and again are very good MM II (note polychrome). #5432 has only 1/5 table of pottery, but it is usefully diagnostic of MM IIB, including fragments of dark-slipped hemispherical cups, and a rim of a carinated bridge-spouted jug (143) akin to those from Room 10a and Context i6a.2 (see above), and with parallels from Quartier Mu.125 #5434 also yielded just 1/5 table of pottery, but this zembil too includes interesting MM II polychromy, such as a carinated cup with red and white dots (125), and 134, a straight-sided cup with polychrome criss-cross lines (cf. Petras example from Siteia Museum); more details are in the catalogue below. The sequence continues with #5436, consisting of 2/3 table of MM II pottery, among which a carinated cup with grooves and paint overlapping onto base (129), a small bridge-spouted jug (142), a spouted lekane in a Mirabello fabric (147), white-on dark hemispherical cup fragments and straight-sided cups (see catalogue below). #5438 is a medium zembil (hemispherical cup fragment with scrappy white-on-dark; straight-sided cup base), and #5439 a small one, but both are MM II. There are grounds for assigning all of this material, certainly from the lower zembils, to MM IIB. There are definite differences from the substantial fills from the East side of Block M that we have assigned to MM IIA: there are no offset bases, almost no tall flaring tumblers, little polychrome, only one or two pieces of amphora with dark-on-light and white piping, and a rarity of parallel striations. A further striking difference is that straight-sided cups are present here, while they are almost entirely absent from the MM IIA fills. Such a distinction would have little merit at Knossos, for example, where straight-sided cups are present in both phases, albeit with some distinctions. At Palaikastro, however, the presence/absence of straight-sided cups does have temporal significance. 123 (9476) flaring tumbler, 10%, 1 base fr, fine buff, wheelmade, lustrous black slip int and ext and under base, with polychrome decoration of vertical red stripes and vertical wavy white lines, D. base 3. #5430. 134 (9485) carinated cup, rim fr, fine buff, wheelmade, black slip int and ext, with polychrome decoration of white zigzag inside rim, and white spiral and red 'spokes' at ext. #5436. 125 (9497) carinated cup, rim fr, fine yellow buff, wheelmade, black slip int and ext, with polychrome decoration of red and white dots to ext, D. rim c. 10.5. #5434. 126 (9498) carinated cup, 2 joining rim frs, fine orange buff, wheelmade, lustrous black slip int and ext, with white-on-dark sweeping diagonal band with quirks above, D. rim 11. #5434. 127 (9492) ribbed carinated cup, small rim fr., fine buff, wheelmade, dark slip int and ext, D. rim c. g. #5432. 128 (9493) ribbed carinated cup, small rim fr., fine buff, wheelmade, dark slip int and ext. #5432. 129 (9480) ribbed carinated cup, base fr., fine buff, wheelmade, brown-black slip int and ext, lapping onto base, well smoothed, D. base c. 5. #5436. 13° (9482) straight-sided cup, base fr., fine buff, wheelmade, straight base edge, black slip int and ext, D. base c. 6.5. #5436. 131 (9483) cup, straight-sided or hemispherical, 1 base fr. and handle root only, fine pale buff, wheelmade, black slip int and ext, D. base c. 4. #5436. 132 (9491) straight-sided cup, rim fr, fine buff, wheelmade, dark slip int and ext with white band int rim and at ext rim with spiral motif/curving line.

However, lower down we find Protopalatial material. There are large cooking pot and coarse ware fragments, including many joining pieces of a pitharaki and a beehive lekane; also note 150 from #5369, a straight-sided cup with flanged base. #5371-72 are smaller zembils, where, although included in the same level, the pottery is now clearly earlier, apparently MM IIB to IIIA: a bevelled base of a straight-sided cup seems MM IIIA, while the rest of the sherds seem MM II (and there is even a fragment of MM IB polychrome). Note also a white-on-dark retorted spiral, a straight-sided cup base with white flecks, and a grooved white-on-dark hemispherical cup. Zembils #5373 and #5374 are small and medium-sized respectively, with MM II and IIIA at the latest.

SUMMARY: BLOCK M IN THE PRE- AND PROTOPALATIAL PERIODS Evidence for EM I or IIA is extremely patchy at Palaikastro, and work to date has revealed nothing of these periods from Block M. The earliest datable levels in Block M can be assigned to EM IIB; EM III, MM IA and MM IB are also represented, albeit very minimally. By far the greatest concentration of early material in Block M comes from beneath later levels on the E side of the Southeast Building. These mostly take the form of substantial, homogeneous fills datable to MM IIA. All of the relevant deposits have already been described in Chapter 2 within their stratigraphic and architectural contexts; here we have treated them mostly from a ceramic perspective, in order to establish their relative date and to investigate what they can tell us of the history of Block M and Palaikastro more generally during the Pre- and Protopalatial periods. 12' Mu IV, pi. 37i.</page><page sequence="168">Chapter 5 Block M in MM IIIA and MM IIIB INTRODUCTION Commenting on MM III, Sackett and Popham in 1965 noted that 'this period was not well isolated and defined in the earlier excavations'.1 They did identify a deposit in Area DD that helped remedy this situation, now more fully published and identified as MM IIIB.2 Brief mention is also made by Sackett and Popham of their excavation of a deep MM fill in the area of T 47-48^ this too has been restudied and turns out to include MM IIIA material, albeit re-deposited.4 Thus prior to the recent campaign of excavation, distinct phases of MM III had not been identified, either in igo2-o6 or 1962-63. If we do go back to the earliest reports, we find in PKU, for example, a section by Dawkins describing the MM III period.5 Dawkins recognises the relative lack of MM III (and LM I) remains, attributing it to the continued use of houses from their rebuilding after the MM II destructions all the way through to LM II or III. Where MM III and LM I deposits are found, he goes on, is where houses have been altered or rebuilt, in the process covering up certain deposits. He provides a few examples: in Block B, in several parts of Block D, in Block 5 20-25 (a space unoccupied by houses at the time and thus able to serve as a dump for the inhabitants), and Block n 38-42, where an accumulated fill spanning MM II to LM I was found. Dawkins viewed MM III and LM I as two successive phases of LM I, with the former poorly represented in any of the deposits mentioned. One vase draws special attention, a cylindrical 'bucket-shaped' vessel 30 cm tall, with horizontal handles and in white-on-dark a large bull's head with double axe between the horns, 'bunches of a daisy-like flower and its leaves', and tortoiseshell ripple and discs, both in white-on-dark, though more commonly found in dark-on-light.6 It is interesting to see this bull motif occur on a MM III piece, presaging more well-known LM IA examples, such as on a pithos from Pseira.7 The early appearance of bull iconography is seen elsewhere too; Hood has suggested that some of the first figurative frescoes at Knossos are probably relief bulls, datable to MM IIIA.8 At Anemospilia there is the famous conical pithos with a bull depicted in low relief, this too datable to MM IIIA.9 And at Akrotiri on Thera a large imported central Cretan flask with a relief bull and lion scene has recently been found, it also in a sound MM IIIA context.10 We cannot say if the Palaikastro example is MM IIIA or B, however. One clue may come from its find context, A 18. Also from this context comes what Dawkins describes as a 'Middle Minoan II saucer'.11 On its deep ledge rim this vase has dark-on-light tortoiseshell ripple, and at its interior what is referred to as 'zig-zag graining', but which is identifiable from the figure as what we would now call 'featherwave'. Featherwave is a decorative feature that begins in MM IIB, but which continues into MM III; it is found combined with ripple decoration at Palaikastro in other contexts, such as Trench DD, ascribed to MM IIIB,12 and indeed in Block 5 between Rooms 1 and 20, among a cache of 48 pots described by Dawkins as MM II but in all likelihood MM IIIB.13 Given the state of the pottery, particularly the preservation of the bull vase, it may be that we are dealing with a context in A 18 connected with the seismic destruction seen across the settlement in MM IIIB.14 When we turn to the recent campaign, MM IIIA is certainly identified in the preliminary report for Block M/Area 6, where pottery of this period had been uncovered in Rooms B, C, D, E and L.15 Prior to this, however, most of the remains so far revealed were MM IIIB and referred to as MM IIIB-LM IA on the whole.16 These and other contexts we will present in detail below. 1 PK VI, 251. 2 See also PK VII, '-&gt;10-15; PK VIII. 3 PK VII, 208. 4 PK VIII. 5 PKU, 18-21. 6 PKU, 19-21, pi.

Building 3 was initially described as an MM III construction,17 but this general impression was subsequently revised once tests had been made, and a layer of foundation and construction debris produced fragmentary MM II pottery. This was used to argue for a construction of the building during the Old Palace period, 'with its megalithic fagades and typical MM layout'.18 Building 7 was described as having MM IIIB-LM IA remains,19 until a test on its East Fagade produced rather more specific evidence, with Surfaces V and IV referred to as MM IIB/IIIA and MM IIIA, and Surface III as somewhere between MM IIIA and MM IIIB-LM IA, on stratigraphic grounds alone, and Surface II as MM IIIB-LM IA.20 This is the first reference to 'MM IIIA' from this campaign, and is connected to a synthetic paper by MacGillivray and Driessen providing an important summary of the sequence at Palaikastro in the light of the first few years of the new excavation campaign.21 In this they state that 'the MM II of the previous excavators should now be regarded as MM IIB/IIIA in Knossian terms', while 'the MM III of the old excavations belongs to the MM IIIB/LM IA transition in central Crete'.22 The latter we would now choose to describe simply as MM IIIB and the former as MM IIIA. It is unclear why these authors use the term 'MM IIB/IIIA' rather than just MM IIIA, as a few lines later they do refer to 'MM IIIA' pottery under Block N and west of the new excavations (suggesting they were outside the town at this time). It may be related to MacGillivray's 1986 thesis on MM pottery from Knossos, in which he had assigned much MM IB pottery to MM ilA, and much MM IIB to MM IIIA; this position was subsequently modified, in the light of a pottery workshop at Knossos in 1992.23 This change of tack may then lie behind the much less ambivalent assignation of Building 6 deposits to 'MM IIIA' in the 1998 preliminary report. Indeed, the difficulties in identifying distinct phases of the MM period in East Crete should not be underestimated; this was discussed in the previous chapter for MM I—II, and it is little different for MM III. At very few sites in East Crete have distinct MM IIIA contexts yet been defined.24 The difficulties in MM III are not confined to East Crete; one need only look to Knossos and the Mesara for a fuller view of the chronological difficulties. Indeed, the general problems with MM III are aptly summarised by Betancourt: 'much of the ceramics of MM III represents a surprising and still unexplained recession in both style and technology'.25 Betancourt chooses not to subdivide MM III, stating that 'it is still difficult to distinguish MM IIIA as a separate period'.26 Walberg has taken a similar line.27 More recent work, however, is somewhat more optimistic. The MM IIIA period has been defined separately from MM IIIB in a whole host of recent publications, for Knossos,28 Archanes,29 Galatas,30 and Phaistos, Ayia Triada and Kommos.31 Further light has recently been shed on this distinction in the course of a workshop on MM III that took place at Knossos in July 2008.32 In Block M we do now have an ample and well-stratified corpus of both MM IIIA and IIIB pottery; all the relevant contexts are presented here in turn, beginning with MM IIIA. MM IIIA CONTEXTS FROM BLOCK M Across Block M we find 25 contexts datable to MM IIIA, some substantial and others small. Here we present them in numerical order by room. Context 4.1 (fig. 5.1) Room 4 is one of the deeper semi-basement rooms in the w part of the Southeast Building. The lowest level above bedrock revealed a foundation deposit, consisting of a large hemispherical cup (158) that had been inserted into a much earlier stratum containing EM IIB sherds. The cup was found at 10.30!. Other foundation deposits of this kind, also datable to MM IIIA, are found elsewhere in the building; this particular deposit is discussed elsewhere in the context of other foundation deposits.33 A small find worth noting is a part of the left pelvis of a cow, seemingly with worked, rounded edges to make it into a tool, perhaps a kind of shovel (6118; see Chapter 8). 17 PKi988, 421. 18 PK 1991, 123. 19 PK 1990, 137. 20 PK 1991, 133. 21 PK Settlement. 22 PK Settlement, 403. 23 MacGillivray 1986; MacGillivray 1998; Cadogan et al. 1993. 24 Though see papers by Tsipopoulou on Petras, Platon and Gerontakou on Zakros, and Barnard and Brogan on Mochlos, in Macdonald and Knappett forthcoming. 25 Betancourt 1985, 103. 26 Betancourt 1985, 67. 27 Walberg 1992. 28 Hood 1996; MacGillivray 2007; Hatzaki 2007; Knappett et al. in preparation. 29 Archanes. 30 Rethemiotakis 2002. 3' Girella 2007. 32 See Macdonald and Knappett forthcoming. 33 MacGillivray et al. 1999, pi.

ROOM 8 A substantial layer of re-deposited debris, including some burned mud brick and much sherd material, sits on the slab floor at the bottom of the room. Within this floor was a sunken basin (Context 8.1), but the material within it was no different from those contexts (5.2 to 8.4) which overlay the slightly higher slabs around (and indeed displayed numerous joins). Built over this MM IIIA debris we find the oblique wall 710, for which the MM IIIA pottery beneath provides a terminus post quem. We shall come back to this in more detail in the relevant section below on the MM IIIB use of the room. A context that stratigraphically would appear to be connected to the MM IIIB use seems instead still to have MM IIIA types: this is Context 8.10, described below.</page><page sequence="175">PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN Fig. 5.8.

Context 8.1 (figs. 5.8-5.9) This context is formed by the debris found on the sunken paving (#8108, 8111 and 8113) and covers a whole 1x2m table with worn coarse and cooking pot ware, as well as various ledge-rim bowl fragments of the MM IIIA type with the pronounced ledge (222-228). We also find a couple of rim fragments of plain carinated cups (229-230), a distinctive MM IIIA type: carinated cups are slipped in MM II, and are out of use by MM IIIB.37 There are also straight-sided cups with dark slip and simple white-on-dark banded decoration; their profiles at the base are either straight or bevelled (231-236), with none of the flanged bases that become common in MM IIIB.38 We also see a bowl-ladle with dark paint at rim (237), a dip-rim bowl (238) and the upper body of large beaked jug in a coarse grey fabric with thin white-on-dark spiral of MM IIIA type (240). 239 combines ripple and featherwave decoration on an in-and-out bowl: featherwave being a decorative feature beginning in MM IIB and not surviving beyond MM III, and ripple only seen from MM IIIA; thus this is a good diagnostic piece for MM III, and particularly IIIA.

The material is largely unciiaaiiostic, iust generically datable to MM III-LM I. Context 8.4 (fig. 5.11) This consists of #8085, 8097, 8099, 8102 and 8104: note there are some joins with Contexts 8.1 and 8.2 (noted above) demonstrating the unity of this material on both sides of Wall 710. #8097 covers a 1/4 table, mostly conical cup and ledge-rim bowl fragments, among which a few profiles. Also here, rather unexpectedly, are six joining fragments of a hemispherical cup with dark-on-light crescents; though this is a decorative style commonly associated with MM IIIB or LM IA, it may begin as early as MM IIIA. That said, there are also two small fragments of a ledge-rim bowl with dark-on-light glossy decoration, again seemingly later. #8085 is a small zembil with little that is diagnostic, except for a small piece of tortoiseshell ripple. #8099 has many more cooking pot ware fragments and a few ledge-rim bowls of MM IIIA type, covering a 1/4 table, with little else distinctive to note. #8102 is a tiny, undiagnostic zembil. #8104 though is more plentiful, with substantial cooking pot ware fragments, large MM IIIA-type ledge rim bowls (258), straight-sided cups with straight base (264) or bevelled base (266), a plain carinated cup (263), very diagnostic for MM IIIA (see comments above for Context 8.1); and a complete handlamp with roll handle and burning at rim (266).</page><page sequence="179">PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN Fig. 5.12.

This underlines the fact that the MM IIIA destruction material in this room was never fully cleared out. The zembils concerned are #8058, 8077 and 8088. The first of these is a small zembil with little diagnostic pottery except for one catalogued ledge-rim bowl (276), possibly of MM IIIB type. #8077 is also a tiny zembil, and comes from the rubble beneath the slabs in the doorway of Wall 589; the latest sherd material is probably MM III. Finally, #8088 is from a mixed wash layer (nerochoma), with pebbles, sherds and catalogued vases, listed below. These include two ledge-rim bowls, one of MM IIIA type (274-275); one S-profile conical cup (277); a hemispherical cup (278) and a tripod cooking pot (279).</page><page sequence="180">BLOCK M IN MM IIIA AND MM IIIB Fig. 5.13.

ROOM 8 POTTERY SUMMARY The ledge-rim bowls of MM IIIA have a more pronounced ledge than later ones, as is also evident in a deposit excavated in Gamma 48 in 1962-63.39 The plain carinated cups are also a distinctive MM IIIA feature at Palaikastro. The straight-sided cups differ from later MM IIIB and LM IA types — they are broader than tall, and tend to be bevelled but not flanged. They also have simple white bands, and one fragment (232) even has red bands reminiscent of MM II polychromy, pointing to MM IIIA rather than IIIB. As well as the catalogued examples, there are numerous fragments: c. 10 other bases all the same, and many rim and body fragments. Pieces decorated with dark-on-light motifs are mostly of ripple, though one piece interestingly combines it with featherwave, a decorative style that is first seen in MM IIB.40 Ripple is perhaps more commonly seen as diagnostic of MM IIIB, though recent finds from Akrotiri on Thera, for example, show quite clearly that it can occur from MM IIIA, particularly on closed vessels and small bowls.41 One vessel that does at first look as though it has to be later than MM IIIA is the hemispherical cup with dark-on-light crescents from Context 8.4. This might normally be associated with LM IA, though we have shown previously that crescents of this kind may occur earlier on occasion, as in Room 10a.42 Moreover, there may be grounds for pushing it back earlier still, on the basis of comparison with pieces from Malia, Quartier Epsilon, niveau 2.43 Context 15. j (fig. 5.13) Excavation below the main LM IA floor levels came down upon a layer of pebbles in beaten earth; the pottery appear to be MM IIIA, with wavy line, featherwave and ripple decoration. Here we have just two catalogued pieces from #6567. 280 (9412) beaked jug, 4 frs of neck, semi-coarse yellow orange with phyllite inclusions, wheelmade, with separately added collar, plain, D. rim c. 5. #6567. 281 (9415) ledge-rim bowl, indistinct ledge, 80%, 4 frs, semi-fine orange, wheelmade, plain, Ht 3.5, D. rim 9.5, D. base 4.1. #6567.

There is also 284, the base of a bridge-spouted jar with ripple decoration. In the sherd material we find some ledge-rim bowl fragments, including one from an early thin-walled example; conical cup fragments; and a plain carinated cup fragment, all of which point to MM IIIA. There is also pottery that could be a little earlier, such as some polychrome and black slip, a fragment of a slipped carinated cup, a corner of a dark-slipped square tray and the interior of a flaring bowl with 'sheep' applique. 282 (7906) large bridge-spouted jar, almost profile, needs conservation; coarse orange red with grey core, wheelmade, plain int and white-on-dark ext of thin running spirals and bands, with dashes at top of flattened rim.

One zembil (#2724) consists of earlier material, dating to MM IIB-IIIA, with a profile of a plain carinated cup, and 3 fragments of a black lustrous hemispherical cup, almost eggshell, with fine crinkly rim. Context 32.1 (fig. 5.15) Room 32 is just to the w of Well 576.45 In a foundation trench for Wall 590 some MM IIIA is exposed, one of the only such contexts in the SW Building (see also Context 19.1 above), in part because it is one of the few areas where excavation continued beneath the superficial LM IA. Context 32.4 contains a number of catalogued pots, including ledge-rim bowls (285-286) and bridge spouted jars with ripple decoration (294-295). Note too a trefoil-mouthed jug (293) with two potter's marks on the shoulder, a rare occurrence at Palaikastro, though such marks are well known at Malia during MM IIB.46 The most remarkable piece, however, is 292, a rather unique spouted hemispherical cup with multiple pierced holes forming an internal strainer for the spout; the footed, hollow base is also pierced, presumably as a precaution during firing. No parallels are known, though the decoration of white dots combined with wavy lines is paralleled at Zakros on the same shape.47 Although this example was found in the Zakros Pits, datable to LM IA, the decorative motif has its strongest parallels in MM IIIA.48 See Girella 2007, fig. 7, for Mesara exam See PK Wells.

This suggests that we are into earlier layers, perhaps associated with, or prior to, the construction of Walls 562 and 406.

Context 52.2 This context emerges gradually beneath Context 52.3, in the w of Room 52, a possible dump where material accumulated gradually over a long period of time. It includes an almost complete small amphora (340), and clear MM IIIA types such as distinct ledge-rim bowls and black slip hemispherical cup fragments; also note 341, joining fragments from the upper body and handles of a pithos. In the E of the room, rather than the MM II mentioned in the preliminary report, the pottery here also MM IIIA50 though higher up it includes some intrusive LM IA glossy sherds. Going further down, the material from within the small space next to Wall 410 to the E is homogeneous MM IIIA, covering 1/2 a table. It includes a large pedestalled bowl with ripple/featherwave combination; distinct ledge rims; a plain carinated cup; straight-sided cup bases, some straight, some bevelled; a hemispherical cup with black slip and purple band at rim; a wheel-made amphora base with dark-on-light bands, and another one handmade with dark band and white piping (342). 340 (8854) amphora, small and open-mouthed, with two flattened roll handles from rim to mid-body, semi-fine orange, wheelmade, some slip to int rim and trickle, ext has slip to upper half only, covering handles too, and with some trickle, while lower half is plain, upper.

Context 64.4 From #0773 the pottery is MM IIIA. This continues down to #0783 it seems, which is when the drain appears. MM 111B FROM BLOCK M ROOM 6 Above the MM IIIA deposit of Context 6.1 described earlier we find stratified two distinct MM IIIB layers (and one LM IA level above those). We start with the lowermost of these, 6.2, then move on to 6.3. We also present here Context 6.5, which comes from between Rooms 6 and 7. Context 6.2 (fig. 5.20) This lies over the lowest level in the room, Context 6.1. It consists of a silty, pebbly waterborne layer, and lies immediately beneath the fill of Context 6.3. The 23 catalogued pots consist of eight ledge-rim bowls (343-350), six conical cups (351-356), two straight-sided cups (357-358), a rounded cup (359), an in-and-out bowl (360), two bowl ladles (361-362), a miniature juglet (363) and two bridge-spouted jars (364-365). The ledge-rim bowls are of the type with indistinct rim that seem typical of this phase,51 in contrast to those with a pronounced ledge seen in MM IIIA contexts. The tall conical cups are also commonly encountered in this phase, as are bowl-ladles (see also Room 10a). The in-and-out bowl, though not exclusively found in MM IIIB, is generally considered a hallmark of the period. The bridge-spouted jar with trickle decoration (365) is not particularly diagnostic, while 364 has traces of dark-on-light petaloid loop decoration which one might normally expect of LM IA, but which does occur in other MM IIIB contexts here. 343 (9x48) ledge-rim bowl, 60%.

A 49~51 • Context 6.3 (figs. 5.21-5.22) Above Context 6.2 is a substantial rubble fill containing a mass of MM IIIB pottery. The 46 catalogued pots include 13 ledge rim bowls (366-378), four conical cups (379-382), three in-and-out bowls (383-385), three rounded bowls (386-388), four hemispherical cups (389-392), a rounded cup (393), four straight-sided cups (394-397), two bowl-ladles (398-399), two globular askoi (400-401), a piriform rhyton (402), four bridge-spouted jars (403-406), a beaked jug (407), three small/miniature amphoras (408-410) and a pithoid(?) jar (411). The combination of white-on-dark decoration, such as the white dots on bowl 388 or the spirals on the shoulder of jug 407, with dark-on-light, such as the ripple and wavy lines on in-and-out bowl 383, or the ripple on bridge-spouted jars 403-404, is typical of MM IIIB. Note too that although ripple is the dominant dark-on-light style, there are also other motifs present, such as the open spiral and floral motifs on bowl 385. The floral scroll on cup rims 389-390 one might not expect to see until LM IA, but this is perhaps just further proof of the beginnings of these styles in the MM IIIB period. 366 (9053) ledge-rim bowl, complete.

ROOM 8 In the lower levels of Room 8 are the MM IIIA contexts described earlier. The oblique wall 710 is associated with the MM IIIB use and alteration of the room. Although it was only a single stone in width it seems to have served a structural purpose. The topmost preserved stones were flat with fairly regular gaps between stones and this may have served to support a wooden floor at approximately the same height. The space between the top of the wall, where the floor level may have been, and its base (lying on the uneven MM IIIA fill), seems to have been a subfloor space: it may thus have merely partitioned a subfloor basement. It includes a mix of material, with both MM IIIA from lower levels and some LM IA that might have been intrusive from higher levels, this noted particularly around the edges of the room (possibly deposited when robbing out the wooden material). There is also, however, in situ material, notably two cooking pots (279, 454) either side of the partition wall 716 at the same absolute height (Contexts 8.5/8.6 and 8.10) these were carefully set in the ground, packed in with stones. One of them was surrounded by and full of chunks of plaster (possibly just fallen in), and neither seemed to have been used for cooking (as both were missing their legs) in this final deposition. This activity is datable to MM IIIB, though around the pot on the s side of 716 the pottery was MM IIIA (albeit with one later fragment) and is listed above in the MM IIIA section. The pot on the n side of 716 (Context 8.5/8.6) also had several fragments of LM IA pottery near, notably the bridge-spouted jar with petaloid motif — the rest of which came from the far side of the room, along Wall 577. The occurrence of LM IA pottery along the walls of the room is worth noting. Perhaps the wooden substructure of the floor had indeed survived, only to be robbed out at this later date (much of the building seems to have been stripped at an advanced stage of LM IA). Other intermediate levels either side of the wall seem patchy, such as Contexts 8.J-8.9 and 8.11, and generally datable also to MM IIIB, though with some admixture. Context 8.5 (figs. 5.25-5.26) This is a deposit with cooking pot and fallen plaster, comprising zembils #8070-71, 8073-74 and 8080-82. Note also that cross-joins exist between 8068 and 8071, 8073 and 8101, 8101 and 8103, 8101 and 8127/9. #8070 is a small to medium zembil, with small low conical cups, one flanged and one bevelled straight-sided cup. #8071 is a large zembil, covering a 1/2 table, with a ripple decorated bridge-spouted jar having joins to #8068/9. *8073 covers a 1/2 table, with many joins to #8101. There is also a substantial base fragment of a tub/pithos with a trace of a spigot at its base; note also joining baking plate and cooking pot fragments. Note too the glossy dark-on-light hemispherical cup that can be linked to LM IA, suggesting that this material might have been disturbed. On the other hand, #8074 has the almost complete tripod pot 454 seemingly in situ. #8080 is a tiny, non-diagnostic zembil, as are #8081/2: both tiny zembils, with generic MM III-LM IA. #8101 has many joins with #8073 and #8103, and a number of small finds [108-114].</page><page sequence="194">BLOCK M IN MM IIIA AND MM IIIB 165 Fig. 5.25.

There are some worn dark-on-light body sherds with spirals, crescents and ripple, which can be found in MM IIIB. Note too there are cross-joins with #8055 (Context 8.y). #8060 is a small zembil, again with some early (MM) kick-up, though with mostly MM IIIB features such as base of a flanged/bevelled straight-sided cup with white-on-dark decoration. #8061 is a medium-sized zembil with nothing more diagnostic than MM III-LM IA, but do note cross-joins with #8070 (Context 8.5). #8068 covers a 1/3 table, and some of the ripple decorated bridge-spouted jar comes from here (and #8o6g). #8069 is a large zembil, covering a 1/2 table. More of the ripple bridge-spouted jar 468 comes from here, with joins also to Context 8.5. This type is very diagnostic of MM IIIB. The ceramic features from this zembil are certainly MM III, including a flanged straight-sided cup, and one with straight lower body too; a small pinched rim tumbler (MM IIIA), fragments of a Mirabello pithos joining with #8056; a hemispherical cup with white-on-dark band and wavy line (MM IIIA); and a large slab of a hearth or lid.

POTTERY SUMMARY OF CONTEXTS 8.5-8.6 These two contexts should probably be treated as one — given the cross-joins of the large ripple decorated bridge-spouted jar 468 — largely in 8.6 (#8068-69) but also some in 8.5 (#8071). One feature to note is that the straight-sided cups are of the tall flanged-bevelled type so common in MM IIIB and LM IA. This marks an important difference from Contexts 8.1-8.4 (MM IIIA, described earlier), in which most straight-sided cups are bevelled (or straight), and lower. This is suggestive that Contexts 8.5-8.6 are later. Added to this, there are no tooled ledge-rim bowls in these contexts, again in contrast to 8.1-8.4: the ledge-rims are indistinct, as is common with the MM IIIB versions of this form. One or two conical cups look a little like LM IA, but none is absolutely canonical, and one can imagine them existing in MM IIIB. Ripple decoration is also common, as is typical in MM IIIB (see also at Knossos). Two small pinched-rim bowls are more commonly found in MM IIIA contexts, so these may be survivors. A key dating issue for these contexts concerns the dark-on-light bridge-spouted jar with petaloid loops, 449. Its glossy dark-on-light finish makes it difficult to put in MM IIIB. There are two ways to explain this. First, one could say that as it comes from zembils on the far sides of the room, near the walls, that it, like the other later material is intrusive and connected with the robbing out of the floor and timbers. Alternatively, one might argue that the context is unproblematic, and that dark-on-light decoration of this kind can start in MM IIIB. We do note the early occurrence of what might typically be considered LM IA decoration already in MM IIIB.52 In this regard we also note from #8073 one body sherd of a hemispherical cup (442) with glossy dark-on-light bands and probable crescents; yet note the earlier discussion from MM IIIA Room 8 concerning the early MM III occurrence of dark-on-light crescents. 52 PKND.</page><page sequence="198">BLOCK M IN MM IIIA AND MM IIIB 169 454 is a tripod cooking pot that is complete except for its feet. It contains a lot of plaster, but it has probably just fallen into it (there was a lot of plaster in this level). There is also a coarse jar (455) that, like 452, was split between the area around the tripod pot by Wall 716 and the far n of the room by Wall 577. The tripod pot (like its partner in Context 8.10) was firmly set into the ground (plate 8 f) and could not have been heated from the underside. It is possible that it was used in conjunction with 'pot boilers' i.e. heated stones added into the pot. The uncatalogued but selected material does contain domestic material possibly connected with cooking — a large thick flat tray with buff burnished upper side; a large chunk of pithos base (possibly being reused here?); three joining baking plate fragments; three rim fragments of a large basin/lekane; but this material is so fragmentary that it is more likely in reuse (see Context 42.1 and fig. 2.47: 12 where a large baking plate fragment was used to wedge in the collection pithos in the wine press). Also note six body sherds of a Mirabello pithos, with thin relief lines and trickle decoration. A handful of profiles of ledge-rim bowls and conical cups replicate the catalogued material. Context 8. j (#8053-55 and 8062-63) The zembils forming this intermediate layer cover c. 1 1/2 tables all told, and the pottery is generally quite worn, with little diagnostic other than MM III ledge rims. Note also some earlier MM kick-up, perhaps from collapsed mud brick. #8055, for example, has LM IA sherds, such as a lower body of a hemispherical cup with dark-on-light decoration. Note too MM IIIA material such as ledge-rim bowls with pronounced rim, and a profile of a pinched-rim bowl. Context 8.8 (#8047, 8066, 8072 and 8083-84) This comes from below the silty layer that is Context 8.9 (see below). There is only c. 1/2 a table of pottery, with MM IIIB features such as ledge-rim bowls and S-profile conical cups, although there are both earlier and later elements too, such as glossy dark-on-light LM IA sherds and MM IIIA ledge rim bowls with pronounced rims. Context 8.9 (#8046, 8049 and 8065) This is a silty layer. Note that there are joins with #8047 in Context 8.8. The pottery includes MM III ledge-rim bowls, seemingly of both IIIA and IIIB type. We also find a body sherd with white-on-dark dots and a straight-sided cup rim fragment with purple on black, both perhaps MM IIIA. Context 8.11 (#8050-51, 8057) This is another group of mixed tumble from the middle levels of the Room. #8050 is a small to medium zembil, badly worn, and with earlier MM pottery. There are catalogued ledge-rim bowls, presumably MM IIIB, and worn joining fragments of the lower half of a straight-sided cup with bevel, datable to MM IIB-IIIA. #8051 comes from n of doorway 589, and is a small zembil of worn material including some earlier MM pottery, but hardly datable. Finally, #8057 is a tiny zembil, with little diagnostic save for a possible plain carinated cup fragment of MM IIIA type. Context ioa.2 This consists of a substantial MM IIIB destruction deposit published as Room R1.53 196 catalogued pots were described, the majority of which being ledge-rim bowls, conical cups and straight-sided cups. The deposit also included a much smaller number of bridge-spouted jars (six) and jugs (seven), as well as cooking pots of various shape and size. Most of the pottery is plain or simply decorated: either with simple decoration of white bands on a dark slip, or with simple dark-on-light bands or trickle. Slightly more complex white-on-dark motifs consist almost solely of spirals. Dark-on-light motifs include tortoiseshell ripple (e.g. on an in-and-out bowl), simple spirals, crescents and running ivy. The last motif in particular, found on one partially preserved closed vessel, is generally linked to LM IA, though here it is taken as evidence that some styles commonly assumed to begin then may actually just make their debut at the end of MM IIIB. Context iia.2 (formerly R3) (figs. 5.28-5.33) A small section of this had already been excavated in 1996, as a continuation of Room 10a (formerly Room Ri). The latter contained a large primary deposit of pottery, published elsewhere.54 The deposit 53 PK ND. 54 PK ND.</page><page sequence="199">PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN Fig. 5.28. MM IIIB pottery from Context na.2. Catalogue numbers 470-508. is slightly different to that in Room Ri (briefly described above) in that it does not seem to be quite as in situ — as if the pottery has fallen from some greater height, or been disturbed. Much the same range of pottery types is present, with plain handleless vessels dominant (c. 8o°/o of the assemblage). These come in two types, the conical cup (60 examples catalogued) and the ledge-rim bowl (42 examples catalogued). Storage vessels are almost absent, but some interesting cooking ware types do occur, such as a well-preserved baking plate (610) and a pedestalled rounded bowl with heavy burning (604). Also notable are the three complete bowl-ladles (601-603), one of which had been adapted at some stage, presumably once the internal handle had broken off, for use as a handlamp, judging by the burning marks at the rim spout. An interesting and unique functional feature of the deposit is the stacks of unfired ledge-rim bowls and conical cups (see plate 19 d-e). These are in many cases stacked within fired versions of the same type, so it seems unlikely that these were stacked ready for firing. Moreover, there is no indication that this room or any adjacent area was involved in pottery production. Indeed, the room seems destined,</page><page sequence="200">BLOCK M IN MM IIIA AND MM 111B 171 as was also argued for Room 10a, for the provision of token hospitality in the nearby court (Room ga), with dozens of simple cups being stored for such a purpose. Might these then have been vessels that had been imperfectly fired and yet were considered adequate for a one-off use before being discarded? In terms of dating, this material must be precisely contemporary with Room 1 oa, on both stratigraphic and stylistic grounds, placing it in PK Period IX, or MM IIIB in central Cretan terms. It is a key indicator of the principal period of use for the Southeast Building, and of the destruction that befell it before the LM IA period, when it appears no longer to be in use.

Context 17.1 (fig. 5.35) The early floor and structure cut through by the LM IB Well 605 included some pottery, notably 636, a bridge-spouted jar with tortoiseshell ripple decoration, commonly MM IIIB (but also potentially IIIA).56 This has already been illustrated in a preliminary report.57 There is not really any reason to see it as a foundation deposit, however, as it was found mixed in with the rest of the debris; rather this may be an in situ destruction layer. Zembils #1830-31, from which some of 636 derives, also contain a profile (two joining fragments) of an in-and-out bowl with polished buff slip over a pink-orange clay and dark-on-light bands; and a profile (three joining fragments) of a plain, S-profile cup. Both of these are consistent with a date in MM III, more probably MM IIIB. A sounding here to date Walls 631, 632 and 634, the latter of which was covered by this floor, continued to find MM III pottery, though the walls are likely earlier. 636 (5178) bridge-spouted jar, convex-concave with dark-on-light tortoiseshell ripple decoration, Ht 23, D. profile, fine orange buff,wheelmade, burnished ext surfaces rim 16 D. base 9.5. #1827, 1828, 1830, 1831. 56 PK Wells. 57 PK 1994/6, fig. 4.</page><page sequence="209">180 PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN Context 32.2 There was a deep fill in a foundation trench along the s side of Wall 590; this fill was presumably put down before the laying of the paving slabs at the s of the room. #7756 is mostly the fill, and produced almost a whole table of pottery, including large thick hearth fragments; but this zembil also began to hit a pot deposit described in the MM IIIA section above (Context 32.1). The fragmentary pieces from #7756 are presumably from the fill and date to MM IIIB, e.g. 294-295, while the more complete pots from this zembil belong with the MM IIIA deposit described earlier. Nonetheless, because of the uncertainty, all of the catalogued material is grouped under Context 32.1 (see MM IIIA section above). Context 36.1 #7739 is in the alleyway Room 36, just outside Room 37, with some paving and a bench. It produces 1/4 table of pottery with some joins, and seemingly MM IIIB: there are straight-sided cup bases that are dark slipped and bevelled/flanged; a hemispherical cup with grooves inside and out; and 637 is a ledge-rim bowl, consistent with MM IIIB. #7741 is in the same area as #7739, and is a small zembil consistent with the above, with the base of closed vessel with tortoiseshell ripple decoration, and the profile of a ledge-rim bowl. This alley and the small two-roomed structure to which it led (at Rooms 37 and 38) appear to have preserved a segment of MM IIIB occupation. Just N of Wall 559 in #7743 and #7744, a handful of ledge-rim bowl fragments are again suggestive of a date in MM IIIB. This goes further down with #7751-52 which, although they are small zembils with very little to go on, do seem generally consistent with a date in MM III. Also in the East Extension of Room 37, Wall 562 is cleaned in #7750; this is a small zembil, possibly MM III, but not much to go on, except for one catalogued piece, a deep conical lekane (638). 637 (3189) ledge-rim bowl, almost complete, semi coarse orange, wheelmade, uneven manufacture, plain, Ht 3.3, D. rim 9.6, D. base 4.3. #7739, [6], 638 (9000) deep conical lekane, thickened, flattened and everted rim, two horizontal roll handles, restored to 70%, coarse orange-red with phyllite inclusions, wheelmade, plain, Ht 23.5, D. rim 27.7, D. base 14. #7750, [14].

South of Wall 550, and N of 554, a plaster surface emerges to the w; and the associated pottery, including ledge-rim bowl fragments, is MM IIIB or LM IA. At 11.12! we find painted plaster, and an intriguing fragment of a thick-walled flask (639), very much like those found in the North Lustral Basin at Knossos (MM IIIA). The Knossos examples have been shown through petrographic analysis to be off-island imports,58 and this example too is in an odd fabric that is surely non-local. 639 (9849) thick-walled flask, one body fr only, brown an import (off-island?), coil-built with roughly made thick with thick grey core and clear glassy inclusions, presumably walls, plain. #2736. 58 Knappett 2006.</page><page sequence="210">BLOCK M IN MM IIIA AND MM IIIB Fig. 5.37. MM IIIB pottery from Context 42.1. Catalogue numbers 640-647. Context 42.1: patatiri andpithos (fig. 5.37) The material described here concerns the use of the wine press during MM IIIB, particularly the patatiri, the material inside it (#5519, SS8) and material set around the collection pithos (#5520). Both pieces of the pithoid jar 653 and a small dark-slipped straight-sided cup with bevelled base (647) were found inside the patatiri. Otherwise this context produced only a small amount of pottery, difficult to date but broadly assignable to MM II—III. Combined with other evidence, this might mean that this press had a long life. This patatiri or grape press [51] drained into the collection pithos (640), placed directly underneath the spout of the patatiri. The body profile, rim morphology and handle arrangement all serve to identify this pithos as an MM II type, with parallels from Malia Quartier Mu, though this is in a local fabric.59 This relatively early date for the pithos (i.e. earlier than the apparent main phase of use of the wine press, in MM III) takes on more meaning when considered in its stratigraphic context: when the floor into which it was dug was excavated and removed, the levels beneath produced pottery datable to MM II—III, including a straight-sided cup with bevelled base. Although a small zembil, this material also included the catalogued tall broad conical cups 644-648. A further piece to note in this context is 641, a large flat leg of a kind of baking plate, which was being re-used as packing to secure the pithos in place. 640 (3405) pithos, complete, though one of four vertical handles at upper body broken off and another badly damaged, and 2 lower body handles only (in line with upper 2), both intact; rim is thickened and everted, and lower body has 2 ridges; coarse red with phyllite inclusions that are grey to pink in colour, large areas of lime-popping, handmade, self-slip to ext and int rim, with a few flecks to int body, Ht 69, D. rim 33, D. base 24.

Context 42.2: the wine press (fig. 5.38) An undisturbed level is reached, at c. io.g8t, and the pithoid jar 653 is revealed. Also uncovered are catalogued pots, which include 648, a ledge-rim bowl, and 651, a relief quadruped rhyton cup, found at 10.85!, which possibly went originally with the pithoid jar 653. This piece is decorated with tortoiseshell ripple, which helps to place it in MM III, but otherwise there are no good parallels whatsoever for this kind of cup rhyton, particularly with its unique relief animals (straight-tailed pigs?). Further excavation to find the floor produced more MM IIIB pottery including the rounded cups 649-650. A floor is finally reached and walls of the tank appear (also a fragment of pithoid jar 653). On the plaster floor of the tank little diagnostic pottery is found, but some dark-slipped cup fragments (carinated, hemispherical) look to be MM II. The most spectacular find, however, is the already mentioned pithoid jar 653 with dark-on-light decoration of ripple and crescents with added white spirals.

To the se outside the room (in what is in fact Room 41), more MM III pottery appears, though little is diagnostic; but a floor is reached, associated with a couple of early ledge-rims (MM IIIA), and 655, a conical bowl. 654 (2731) miniature rounded bowl, 80%, 2 frs, semi fine red, plain, wheemade, Ht 3.1, D. rim 4.9, D. base 3. #5468, [16]. 655 (2796) large conical bowl, fragmentary, coarse red brown with phyllite inclusions and burning to interior, plan, wheelmade, Ht 5, D. rim c. 24, D. base c. 12. #5472, [17]. Context 42.3: disturbed upper levels This context consists of the upper levels above the wine press. It falls within the area affected by later LM III activity (and indeed there is evidence for LM III disturbance of the lower, MM IIIB levels). Upper levels produce just over one table of pottery, containing some LM III, and otherwise what could be MM III, but nothing identifiably LM I. Some upper levels are in the area of what later emerges as Room 41, and here Neopalatial pottery is found. Context 43.2 The wall lines defining Room 43 emerge (#5523-24), with a tall conical cup 656 probably of MM MB date. The sherd material is moderate in quantity, with joining fragments of a tumbler or tall conical cup, and a fragment of tortoiseshell ripple. Excavation of a large bone deposit in a probable pit (top at 10.69?) reveals only a tiny amount of undiagnostic pottery, though pottery in association with a line of plaster at 10.60T has MM MB ledge-rim bowl fragments and joining sherds of a bridge spouted jar. The bone deposit continues down (bottom at 10.42-10.47T) and more pottery emerges</page><page sequence="212">BLOCK M IN MM IIIA AND MM IIIB 183 Fig. 5.38. MM IIIB pottery from Context 42.2.

Context 45.4 At the upper part of an important stratified sequence above MM IA (Context 45.1), MM IIB (Context 45.2) and MM IIIA (Context 45-3), this context has already been published as an MM IIIB type deposit.60 The pottery was likened to that from Room 10a (Ri), albeit not quite as undisturbed as that deposit. About 90 vessels were catalogued, with ledge-rim bowls, conical cups and straight-sided cups dominant, though with significant quantities also of other cup types, pouring vessels and cooking pots. As with the substantial bodies of material from Rooms 1 oa, 11a, 14 and 16, and indeed elsewhere across Block M, what we see here is probably the result of a massive seismic destruction that struck Palaikastro at the end of MM IIIB.61 These vessels stored in Room 45, a kind of pantry or closet comparable to Room 10a, may have been destined for use in the preparation and serving of token hospitality in the small adjoining paved court, Room 46. Context 46.1 (fig. 5.40) This context consists of the material on the paving slabs covering the floor of the room. There is only a little pottery on the slabs, principally three relatively large vessels — 661, 662 and 663 — a beaked jug, and two large collar-necked jars. 662 has distinctive white-on-dark spirals at the upper body which help to place it in MM III. We also find a handful of small vessels, including a large tumbler (664a), a conical cup (664b) and ledge-rim bowls assignable to MM IIIB (664C-h). 661 (2212) beaked jug, very worn and fragmentary with orange, wheelmade with some coil seams at int, plain, Ht no base, coarse red with phyllites, plain.

Context 53.1 (fig. 5.41) This is MM IIIB material in the paved alley, stratified beneath a layer of LM IA Theran tephra (see Context 53.2). Although tephra was washed into 665, that pot stuck up some 21 cm above the street paving, and the lens of tephra was itself 15 cm above the street, washed in at an angle level to the ground, showing it washed in after the pot was in place. So it seems likely that the street was filled in somewhat with MM IIIB material from the earthquake destruction and then not used. In any case the pottery covers three tables, with catalogued pottery (see catalogue below), some decorated pottery, As EP87, in PKND.

SUMMARY We have seen in this chapter the extensive evidence for the occupation of Block M during both the MM IIIA and IIIB periods, with 24 contexts assignable to MM IIIA and 29 contexts to MM IIIB. These contexts have produced more than 500 pots that are catalogued here, as well as many thousands of sherds. The MM IIIA contexts testify to the construction (or adaptation) of the building at the start of the period, and some destructive event at its end, followed rapidly and seamlessly by reconstruction at the start of MM IIIB. This period is probably the one during which the Block is most intensively inhabited, until the seismic destruction at its end. It seems unlikely though that this destruction was so severe as to prevent rebuilding; we suspect that the reason for the abandonment of the Block as such, despite some squatter activity during LM IA, is more connected with political factors. The central Cretan features of the Southeast Building may well have signalled political connections between this 'House' and the centre of the island, connections that somehow became strongly discouraged or disadvantageous. It is the partial use of the Block in LM IA to which we now turn in Chapter 6.</page><page sequence="216">Chapter 6 Block M in the LM IA period INTRODUCTION The LM IA period and LM IA pottery styles are now reasonably well defined across the island, thanks in no small part to finds from outside the island, at Akrotiri, Thera. Here, as is well known, a massive destruction horizon is sealed beneath many metres of volcanic ash deposited by the eruption of Thera.1 The pottery in this horizon contains none of the types, such as Marine Style, found in the extensive destructions on Crete marking the end of the LM I period. Together with the discovery of similar pottery associated with Theran ash layers at Cretan sites2 and other off-island sites3, there is solid evidence in support of an earlier relative date, that is to say LM IA.4 Pottery with the same distinctive styles has also been isolated in contexts from various sites across the island, and defined by Hatzaki in the recent Knossos Pottery Handbook as 'the Gypsades Well (Upper Deposit) group'.5 Hatzaki gives synchronisms with Amnisos, Archanes Phourni Building 4, Vathypetro, Kommos kiln, Phaistos, Seli, Malia House E level IIIA, Gournia, Kato Syme, Mochlos Building C, Myrtos Pyrgos, Palaikastro Building 2,6 Priniatikos Pyrgos,7 and Zakros.8 It is interesting that LM IA seems much better represented in East Crete than MM III. However, the early excavators of Palaikastro encountered problems in isolating deposits belonging to the LM IA phase. In the first season of excavation Bosanquet tells of hundreds of vases uncovered in two magazines in House B, labelled Rooms 10 and 13.9 He describes the material more fully in the following year's BSA Annual}0 He argues that the contents of these storerooms Bio and 13 provide an effective illustration of a destruction horizon that he assigns to 'Period II', stating its contemporaneity with houses at Zakros. Some of the vase types were already illustrated in PK /, and more are shown in PK II.U In PK //Bosanquet provides a table listing 25 types,12 mentioning the more than 200 conical cups from B13, and the more than 150 examples of the 'pear-shaped cup without handle' (what we would now call the ogival cup). Beneath this floor deposit Bosanquet excavated further, finding a lower stratum in both B 10 and 13. The pottery from this stratum was burnt, unlike the whole vases above.13 From this stratum also came the important find of a Linear A tablet. A crucial point made by Bosanquet concerns the parallels with Zakros; he states that, 'the potsherds stand to the whole vases above them in the same chronological relation as those of the Zakro Pits to the vases in the Zakro houses'.14 Indeed, some of the pottery he goes on to describe does sound similar to that in the Zakros Pits, but he does recognise that a bridge-spouted jug (with long spout) looks to be 'the latest in the series'.15 He draws a parallel with an example from Vaphio. Further comment on the material from B 10 and 13 comes in the same year from Dawkins.16 He agrees that the pottery from the Roussolakkos floor deposits of B 1-22, A 4 and A 18 looks contemporary with that from the Zakros houses. Yet he says the pottery from the Zakros Pits marks 'an earlier stage which is as yet but slightly represented at Palaikastro'.1' He does follow this parenthetically with a reference to the Bio and 13 lower stratum, but would appear to be not wholly convinced. As yet, neither Bosanquet nor Dawkins gives a more specific period assignation such as LM I, either A or B, to the abovementioned material. This does not occur until PK III, in which the Evans scheme used at Knossos is introduced. Here Dawkins reiterates the findings set out in PK II, but now assigns them new labels. To Late Minoan I he ascribes the burnt stratum in B 10 and 13, and the Zakros Pits; the floor deposits of Roussolakkos (B 1-22 etc.) and the Zakros houses are assigned to LM II, contemporary 1 Doumas 1983; Hardy et al. 1990; for absolute dates, Manning et al. 2006; Wiener 2006; 2007; Warren 2006. 2 E.g.

Dawkins continues his discussion of the LM I period and styles in the following year, in the light of fresh excavations, particularly in blocks X and n.19 He suggests that the LM I period must have been a long one, on the basis of the 'quantity of refuse accumulated', with a metre thick deposit found in n 42. He also identifies LM I walls in Block n (shown on Plates XII-XIII), Block X 51-66, and between X 1-17 and 51-66; these walls follow the lines of the MM constructions, but with a new architectural style of regular courses employing Cape Sidero limestone.20 He goes on: to the fortunate circumstance that this area was early ruined and not occupied in Late Minoan II times, we owe the two largest floor-deposits of Late Minoan I vases from the site, which give us in complete examples what we have elsewhere only in fragments. Dawkins is here referring to Block X, Rooms 30 and 43. X 43 yielded hundreds of small plain cups and saucers, and some fine painted vases, of which two are illustrated.21 One is a small faintly rounded bowl with dark-on-light floral decoration of diagonal branches both inside and out, and the other is a tall bridge-spouted jar with a combination of dark-on-light ripple and crescents with white-on-dark spirals. He draws comparisons with the Zakro Pits material.22 Two more dark-on-light bowls are illustrated, one with crescents and festoons, the other with a floral design: these are both from X 18, and described in the caption as 'of the earlier Late Minoan I style'.23 This term, is the first indication that Dawkins's thinking is shifting towards the recognition of an earlier and later LM I.24 Furthermore, Dawkins points out that this pottery from n 38-40, 42 and 24 differs in date from that of the burnt stratum beneath B 10 and 13.25 He associates the former with earlier LM I, and with the Zakros Pits, while placing the latter (Bio and 13) in later LM I. Thus he modifies his position from earlier publications, and for the first time hints at the existence of what will later become LM IA and IB. Note, however, that this still means the main floor deposits from B 1-22 etc. are linked to LM II. To this horizon he now links X 1 17,26 noting an earlier phase represented by a small deposit of sherds in burnt earth under a floor at the foot of the stairs in Room 15; the sherds resemble those from the Bio and 13 burnt stratum, and thus also assignable in his new dating scheme to later LM I. Dawkins further discusses the differentiation of earlier and later LM I in connection with the pottery from Block I~L27 The final stage in the development of Dawkins's thinking is seen in PKU, published in 1923. By this time the terms 'earlier' and 'later' LM I have been superseded by LM IA and IB respectively. Thus the Zakro Pits and the Block n material mentioned above, including that from n 41, with ash and horncores,28 are described as LM IA. Furthermore, the well in B 4 is described as containing pottery ranging from MM IIIB to LM IA; and the burnt stratum from B 10 and 13 is dated by Dawkins to LM IB, thanks in part to an imported vase dating to the period of the Vaphio tomb.29 Dawkins goes on to make the very interesting point that: ... floor deposits in other houses contained vases at least as early as this which were still in use when the general destruction of the town took place in LM II, and it is probable that the interval was not a very long one.30 Dawkins goes on to describe in some detail many of the main features of LM IA pottery, with discussion of various designs: ripple (thought to mimic wood), rockwork, plant, and floral; and different shapes: bowls, jugs, cups, lids, strainer and saucer, tankard or goblet, rhyta and libation vessels, etc. Examples of ripple come from 3 20 (a straight-sided cup; others of this kind also from n g and 42, 5 25, 30, 43). In-and-out bowls with ripple are also shown, as is a cup with rockwork design illustrated by Evans31 representing the MM IIIB phase, and found in 3 30 (7 examples) and X 43 (17 examples). Most plant designs are arranged in running patterns, wreath or scrolls.32 Also illustrated is the lower part of a ewer or jar, with ripple, crescents and white-on-dark plant motifs.33 The floral designs34 correspond well with what we today recognise as LM IA. The same holds true of further examples illustrated.35 18 PKIII, 195-6. 19 PKIV, 274ff. 20 PKIV, 276. 21 PKIV, fig. 6. 22 Dawkins 1903. 23 PKIV, 276, fig. 7. 24 Also used in the caption at PKIV, fig. 6. 25 PKIV, 282. 26 PK IV, 283. 27 PKIV, 287-88. 28 See PKIV, 287. 29 That shown in PKII, 284-6, fig. 5. 30 PKU, 22. 31 PMI, pi.

X 43 has a bowl with decoration in and out of diagonal branches, comparable to Zakros Pits examples and clearly assignable to LM IA.36 The 'whorl and leaf' motif on a bridge-spouted jar from B 10 is another recognisably LM IA style, although this context is LM IB.37 Yet more LM IA pottery is shown in PKU, illustrating white enrichments, coming from the 'prolific deposit in the north-east region of House II, where there had been a place of sacrifice'.38 Dawkins goes on to say that 'a large proportion of the earlier cups are nearly hemispherical, the side passing smoothly into the base. Two are shown in PI. XVIa, b'.39 The former has diagonal branches, the latter 'whorl and leaf', and so are clearly assignable to LM IA.40 Two deeper cups decorated with leaf sprays are illustrated,41 one horizontal band and the other diagonal; this shape was found in the Zakros Pits, one example with ripple, others a spiral or wreath. Again, these are fine in LM IA. Further LM IA pottery comes from: T 29 ('wares of this period');42 E 11 (a lid with spirals and crescents);43 and T2, a trial trench west of Block A (a waisted strainer). This progression from 1902 to 1923 is remarkable. Initially Bosanquet and Dawkins simply try to place their various deposits in relation to one another, and with particular recourse to deposits from the Zakros Pits and Houses. Then they introduce Evans's LM I and II, subsequently differentiating between LM I earlier and later, before finally settling upon LM IA and LM IB. Much of their final analysis we would agree with today, particularly concerning LM IA, though there is the frustration of not having a clear idea in most cases of the precise ceramic make-up of each deposit they describe. The one major refinement concerns their distinction between LM IB and LM II, though this is not of major concern in this chapter on LM IA, or indeed for Block M generally where LM IB pottery is not well represented except in the wells.44 Key are some of the earliest deposits uncovered from Building B, Rooms 10 and 13; here Dawkins eventually realised that the burnt lower stratum was later than LM I A, and thus quite naturally he assigned it to LM IB. There are excellent stylistic reasons for doing so too. This also meant that the main deposits in these rooms above this burnt stratum were always likely to remain assigned to LM II, later than the LM IB layer beneath. Yet recent work has recognised the existence of an earlier and a later phase within LM IB, identifiable both at Palaikastro and at other sites such as Zakros and Mochlos.45 When we look at the pottery illustrated from the main floor deposits of B 10 and 13, we can recognise many LM IB features.46 The ogival cups from B 13 are further described in PKU and shown in a 'rouleaux of five', as 'many of them were found stacked.'47 Also one may note that Bio has two cup rhyta, one of which is decorated with a frieze of axes; this shape is also found at Zakros, but not in the Zakros Pits.48 This also points to an LM IB date. The contemporaneity of this material with that from the Zakros houses, a point made repeatedly by Dawkins, would tend to support a date in LM IB (late). MacGillivray and Driessen describe LM IA as the period that saw the construction of a large mansion in Block X and the impressive structure that is Building 1 (note too that this building is considered part of a shrine or temple complex).49 The LM IA material from Building 1 is also shown in preliminary reports.50 This pottery includes rounded cups with dark-on-light floral scroll that is very typical of LM IA in East Crete. Also illustrated here is the shoulder of a closed vase with a frieze of double axes, discussed further in a paper by Popham.51 The same decoration is seen also on a vase of the same shape from Knossos, found by Evans in the House of the Frescoes, in what seems to be a LM IA destruction deposit. On stylistic grounds Popham argues that the Knossos example is an import from East Crete. Similar stylistic considerations are employed by Bernini in her analysis of Neopalatial decorative motifs on ceramics from Palaikastro.52 Unfortunately, her study is compromised by her flawed methodology of choosing fineware pieces from selected deposits rather than considering the deposits in their entirety; as a result she misassigns some pieces to LM IA rather than MM IIIB.53 These errors 36 PKU, 27, fig. 17. 37 PKU, fig. 55 38 PKU, fig. 19. Note 3 mentions that fig. 19c is from n 38, e from II 24, f from n 42: all are consistent with LM IA. 39 PKU, 30. 40 NB Betancourt 1983 calls this motif 'petaloid loops' in relation to vases from Pseira: pi. 5, 55 (bridge-spouted jug), 58 (jug); in the plates these vases look LM IA, though the irregular nature of the decoration highlighted in the drawings (figure 9) does make them look LM IB. 41 PKU, pi.

Secondly, Building 2 Room 2 is an in situ destruction deposit, even though the Building itself is not much preserved beyond this room. Thirdly, the LM IA material in and around Block M seems in most cases to fit neither of the above scenarios: it consists largely of sherd material (though there are some more complete deposits), often in association with ash, and frequently washed into pits or over earlier walls and rooms.56 We also see sherds and Theran ash in some quantities washed down the Street B-M. While we do not doubt that the town continued to thrive through the course of LM IA, following what was clearly a substantial seismic destruction in MM IIIB, this does not seem to be the case for Block M. We suspect that the Southeast and Northwest Buildings only saw limited 'squatter' occupation after this destruction, with the Southwest Building probably seeing some fuller use, though its character is unclear. While Driessen agrees that 'at some moment preceding the Theran eruption, efforts were made to dismantle the building', he would seem to place this dismantling well into the LM IA period, as he identifies two LM IA floor levels in the court.57 However, we would argue that the LM IA occupation is very ephemeral and the frequent ash deposits (e.g. Room 12) suggest the building was not properly roofed and operational. We will now examine the nature of the LM IA evidence room by room with a particular focus on the pottery finds. LM IA CONTEXTS FROM BLOCK M, SOUTHEAST BUILDING Contexts ia.3-1(1.4 (plate 4) In this room in the se corner of the SE Building scrappy LM IA material was found throughout in upper levels. It consists of fragments of diagnostic LM iA conical cups on the whole and, because of its fragmentary condition, is not here catalogued or illustrated (as will be the case with a number of the contexts grouped together here). Context ia.4 consists of the upper levels with some possible later contamination; Context ia.3 is material on the plaster floor at 11.25-11.35T. Also just outside the building at the corner of Street B-M with Main Street, the upper levels revealed LM IA floodwash deposits (Context StrBM.5). Along Walls 702 and 707, the South and East Facades respectively, trial trenches from excavations in 1904 were located; although no post-Minoan ceramic material was found, a bullet casing and fragment of iron testify to the modern disturbance of the later contexts. Contexts ib^-ib.4 Room lb also has LM IA material in upper levels, lying above the plaster floor at 11.35-11.40T (Context ib.3). This plaster floor, though probably laid down in MM II—III, must have been exposed in LM IA (note an uncatalogued LM IA type conical cup [7]). There is also a robbing pit (Context ib.4) along ashlar wall 719 associated with LM IA pottery. Contexts 2.2-2.3 This is much like Rooms 1 a and b in having upper levels of LM IA tumble or wash above a plaster floor (at 11.40T) which went with the MM III building. Contexts 3.2-3.3 (fig. 6.1) Again we find upper layers of LM IA material, here associated with tumbled stone debris lying over the schist paving. There is also some LM III robbing pit activity (Context 3.2).

LM IA pottery from Context 4.5. Catalogue numbers 688-695. Context 4.5: deposit with ash at 11.07-11.23T (fig. 6.3) Here we find upper levels with LM IA pottery in association with volcanic ash from the Theran eruption. The catalogued pottery displays a rather typical combination for our LM IA deposits in Block M: cooking pots (694-695) and conical cups (688-691). However, we also have a couple of other interesting pieces, particularly useful chronologically. One is the hemispherical cup 692, which has dark-on-light medallion spirals placing it firmly in LM IA. The other is the double strainer jug 693. This is of the same shape as the LM IA example from Room 6 (736, see below) decorated with dark-on-light diagonal branches, and previously assigned in the preliminary report to LM II—IIIAi, on the basis of its shape. The current example has a red-brown slip and fugitive white painted decoration: it is certainly difficult to place this one as late as LM II—IIIAi, and the combination of shape and ware means it may even have been made in MM III, and LM IA at the latest. Furthermore, it has a secure contextual association with Theran ash. Taken together, this evidence indicates that the shape can certainly occur in LM IA; and thus there is no need to date the Room 6 example any later than LM IA either.

Context 4.6: passage and steps to stoa There is little ceramic material from this context, and is only diagnostic in general terms of the Neopalatial period. Context 5.3: deposit with ash (figs. 6.4-6.5) Here in upper levels Theran ash was found in close association with numerous catalogued pots at 11.30T. The deposit was found overlying and up against the w face of Wall 661 and was thus considered as tumble, perhaps from a shelf or upper floor. While in the decorated material the bridge-spouted jug 730 looks very LM IA, with its dark-on-light spirals and floral motifs with added white, the plain wares are less clear-cut. Some of the 1 o conical cups (696-705) are not of the canonical LM IA type, while there are also 13 ledge-rim bowls (706-718), a type that is generally less common by LM IA, having had its peak in MM IIIB. 696 (9027) conical cup, 90%, 10 frs.

ROOM 8 The MM III levels in Room 8 were described in the previous chapter. The next event discernible in the history of the room is the collapse or removal of the floor above the subfloor space; this may not have happened until LM IA. These upper levels (Contexts 8.12-8.14) are rather difficult to place. During this time elsewhere in the building there seems to be a flood event, with pottery and Theran ash swept across the building and along the streets.. The very thick wall 570 strongly suggest the presence at this side of the building of an upper storey, and debris fallen into Room 7 (particularly a door jamb base) supports this. Context 8.12: upper layer of debris/collapse (#8038, 8040-43, 8045) (fig. 6.8) This could relate to Context 8.9 beneath it. The selected sherd material includes straight-sided cups with bevelled and flanged/bevelled bases of MM III, and MM III (B) ledge-rim bowls. Some of the catalogued material would seem to point to a date in either MM IIIB or LM IA, and thus could be consistent with the lower material in 8.9. At the same time there is earlier material, perhaps from mud brick debris. #8038 is a small zembil, which oddly seems to contain earlier material, such as a MM IB-IIA cup base in white-on-dark with parallel striations at the base, and a MM IIIA-type ledge-rim bowl; these presumably derive from mud brick collapse. #8040 is a small to medium-sized zembil again with earlier MM pottery, and some worn cooking pot ware. #8041 consists of just six sherds, not very diagnostic other than some earlier MM. #8042 is small, with worn pottery, mostly undiagnostic, other than an MM IIIA type ledge-rim bowl. #8043 is a small to medium zembil, with the pottery, catalogued below as 746-747. These would appear to be consistent with MM IIIB or LM IA. #8045 is another small zembil with cooking pot ware and a few earlier MM pieces, and joins with #8043. Fig. 6.8.

Context 8.13: top of debris layer (#8017-21, 8023-24, 8033, 8036-37, 8039) (fig. 6.9) Both this context and 8.14 are quite jumbled: the latest material is LM IA, but there is earlier pottery too. These contexts represent an upper layer of debris, up to what might be the upper surface of this room when last in use; so some of the earlier material may come from these earlier levels, or in the case of the MM II could be from collapsed mud brick debris. As in Context 8.12, this debris layer has early pottery of MM II to IIIA date, seen in #8018-20. Zembil #8020 covers a 1/3 table, with 753, a small cup with washy red slip, slightly everted rim and oddly pinched lip, apparently of MM IIIA date, alongside other MM IIIA types such as a hemispherical cup with offset base, black slip and white decoration. This pattern is repeated in #8021, though here we also find some conical cups seemingly of LM IA type. #8023 is a medium zembil with well-preserved, joining fragments of a baking plate (755): this is often a feature of LM IA deposits across Block M, though the baking plate in itself is hard to date typologically. Other sherds in this zembil are large cooking pot ware fragments and some ledge-rim bowl fragments, diagnostic only of MM III-LM IA. #8033 covers a 1/3 table, again largely coarse and cooking pot ware, with some joining fragments of a wheelmade cooking pot. This is again suggestive of LM IA activity, though there is some worn MM II as well, probably from collapsed mud brick. #8036 forms part of the reworking of the top of the MM III deposit that stretches across Room 8, and contains catalogued ledge-rim bowls (e.g. 752), as well as some joining rim fragments of a small bridge-spouted jar, probably belonging to MM III. #8037 is small with very little diagnostic pottery, while #8039 contains joining fragments of another baking plate with thumb impression in its corner (756). 751 (8797) conical cup, plain, semi-fine orange, wheelmade.

We also see joining baking plate fragments, large cooking pot ware fragments and some MM II dark slipped wares; this is a very similar combination to that found in Context 8.13 (and #8035 also has a lot of worn coarse and cooking pot ware). #8025 is a small zembil from a doorway collapse, and this too has mostly cooking pot ware, though a conical cup profile and a hemispherical cup base with dark-on-light look LM IA, as does 757, a fine small bridge-spouted jar with glossy dark-on-light decoration of 'petaloid loops'.61 757 (8863) bridge-spouted jar, &gt;50 pieces, no foot base; well-polished surfaces with dark-on-light petaloid complete profile, fine medium-soft orange fabric, loops at ext.

A few conical cups and coarse ware fragments found lying on the surface testify to this 'squatter' occupation. Often in these upper levels the most diagnostic pottery consists of conical cups; otherwise cooking pot ware dominates and fine wares are very rare.

Removal of tumbled schist slabs in this area revealed a conical cup of probable LM IA type (uncatalogued, [94]), along with other conical cup profiles, and one glossy dark on-light body sherd also datable to LM IA. Finally, in the north-central area (Context 9a.6), waterborne LM IA layers are found over the earth and pebble floor above the plastered court. Context 9b. 2 This context includes all of the upper zembils across the large limestone slabs of the propylon that revealed LM IA material. The pottery includes a few diagnostic conical cup fragments and some glossy dark-on-light sherds (uncatalogued). Context iob.3: upper levels Upper levels in Room 10b do encounter a little MM IIIB or LM IA pottery. Context 1 ib. 1 A small pot deposit of LM IA date, amidst some burnt debris lying at 11.30T. This includes five conical cups of LM IA type (uncatalogued [50-53], [55]), a jug, as well as some ledge-rim bowl rims and small pierced incense burner fragments. #2858 is s of Wall 811, contains very little pottery and consists of tumble; four conical cups of LM IA type came from this surface, also some possible tephra. #2859 and #2861 are from the SE corner, s of Wall 811, producing lots of mud brick possibly connected with this selfsame wall also a large base of a flanged straight-sided cup, datable to MM IIIB or LM IA, and other small-finded pottery, including a conical cup of LM IA type. Contexts 12(1.6-12(1.7 After the drain in Room 12a went out of use, there is later material: a rather scrappy tumble, including a pocket of tephra.

Catalogue numbers 766 770a. Contexts 12b.6-12b.jy 12b.9-12b.14 (fig. 6.11) Room 12 b has a number of LM IA contexts from pits, although there is still MM present, particularly in 12b.6. Context i2b.j, for example, is from the centre of the room, to the w of the area cut by pits. It lies over the plaster floor that was laid down in early MM IIB, remaining in use through MM III and has pottery covering a whole table, largely LM IA, with numerous diagnostic conical cup fragments, a cup with floral scroll decoration, and flanged profiles of straight-sided cups. There are also large fragments of cooking pot ware, tripod legs and beehive basins as well as some earlier material from MM II levels. Context 12b.9 is a pit cut into the MM II plaster floor and partly over Wall 607. It is tempting to associate it with the LM IA squatter occupation due to its functional features rather than any direct dating evidence; almost all the pottery consists of baking plate fragments, around 40 pieces in all, burnt to the underside, leaving blackened earth beneath. It appears that this shallow pit was specifically dug for the placement and use of the baking plate(s), which lined the pit. Context 12b. 10 is another pit just to the E of this baking pit, and it too overlies Wall 607. It is situated to the w of two other large pits (to be described below), all three probably dating within LM I A, though this one is probably the earliest. The pottery includes a low conical cup (766) that is not a common type and could be either MM IIIB or LM IA, dark-on-light decoration and a straight-sided cup profile with flanged base (uncatalogued [8]), and some units with both MM II pottery (e.g. bevelled cup with black slip and parallel striations) and MM III or LM IA (flanged straight-sided cup base, and a conical cup base). Lower down we do see more MM II material, as the pit cuts through the plaster floor and bites into the lower fill deposit. 766 (5147) conical cup, low type, 75%, semi-coarse orange, wheelmade, plain, Ht 3.5, D. rim 8.5, D. base 3.8. #2779, [6], Context 12b. 11 (fig. 6.11) is another pit at the far E side of the room, e of the main tephra pit. The pottery covers roughly one table. It includes conical cups of LM IA type (e.g. 770), ripple body fragments of a jug/jar, large coarse ware and cooking pot ware fragments, such as part of a fenestrated stand, the neck of a jug with dark-on-light decoration (770a) and hemispherical cup sherds with glossy dark-on-light decoration of floral scroll, and indeed white-on-dark floral scroll (767).

Context 12b. 12 (fig. 6.12) This is the main 'tephra pit' in Room 12b, dug late in LM IA through earlier floor levels and into the thick MM IIA fill; as a result there is a high concentration of MM IIA material as discussed below, but certainly enough LM IA to date the operation, as well as sufficient joins through to the tephra above and the MM II fill below. The LM IA sherds continued down 40 cm into the fill but not to the very bottom (and note fresco fragments [71-72] too). Many of the excavated units are mixed MM IIA and LM IA, the latter with some very interesting material; also note the large quantities, with approximately four tables of pottery. As well as common features such as numerous LM IA type conical cups, dark-on-light foliate decoration, flanged profiles of straight-sided cups, large cooking pot ware fragments, tripod legs, and beehive lekanes, we also find unique pieces such as the lilies jar 784. This piece has very close parallels in its decoration with a tall alabastron from LM IB Zakros,62 but also with a white-on-dark cylindrical pithos from Akrotiri, Thera,63 as well as appearing as a textile motif on the garment of a lady depicted in a fresco in Xeste 3.64 There is nothing here or in surrounding units to suggest anything other than a date in LM IA. The strainers 785 and 786 also come from here — and the latter has cross-joins from top to bottom of the tephra pit. The type is described by the first excavators as a 'two-handled waisted strainer', and is considered popular in LM I.65 Parallels for this form are provided in the pottery typology of Chapter 3. Both 785 and 786 have glossy dark-on-light decoration, the former with medallion spirals (with added white dots), the latter with an isolated spiral and scroll motifs. The MM IIA pottery from this context (of course mixed due to the LM IA pit) has some unique pieces, such as the mouth of a beaked jug 98 (with joins to Context 12b. 1), and a wonderful white-on dark tumbler, 92, for which see discussion of this context in Chapter 4. 771 (7910) conical cup, complete, 6 frs, semi-fine red, wheelmade, plain, Ht 4.1, D. rim 7.7, D. base 4. #6784, [65]. 77a (8247) conical cup, 65%, one piece, semi-fine orange, wheelmade, plain Ht 4.3, D. rim c. 10, D. base 3.6. #6784. 773 (8248) conical cup, 80%, one piece, semi-fine orange-red, wheelmade, plain, Ht 3.7, D. rim 8, D. base 3.6. #6782. 774 (8249) conical cup, 45%, 2 frs, semi-fine orange with grey core, burning ext, wheelmade, plain Ht 3.8, D. rim c. 7.5, D. base 3.9. #6784. 775 (8250) conical cup, 50%, 1 piece, semi-fine pale orange with pale grey core, wheelmade, plain Ht 3.9, D. rim c. 8, D. base 3.5. #6782. 776 (8255) conical cup, 25%, one piece, semi-fine orange, wheelmade, plain, Ht 4.3, D. rim c. 7.5, D. base 4. #6780. 777 (8264) conical cup, 85%, 2 frs, semi-fine orange, wheelmade, plain, Ht 3.6, D. rim 7.9, D. base 4.1. #6782, [64]. 778 (8251) ledge-rim/ proto conical cup, 40%, 1 piece, semi-fine buff, wheelmade, plain, Ht 4.5, D. rim c. g, D. base 4.3. #6780. 779 (8252) ledge-rim bowl, 45%, one piece, semi-fine pale orange, wheelmade, plain, Ht 3.9, D. rim c. 9, D. base 3.9. #6784. 780 (8253) ledge-rim bowl, 25%, one piece, semi-fine pale orange, wheelmade, plain, Ht 4.4, D. rim c. 11, D. base 4.7. #6780. 781 (8254) ledge-rim bowl/conical cup, 45%, one piece, semi-fine buff, wheelmade, plain, Ht 4.3, D. rim c. 9.5, D. base 4.3. #6782. 782 (8256) ledge-rim bowl/conical cup, 35%, two frs, semi-fine grey-buff, blackened on inside, wheelmade, plain, Ht 4.1, D. rim c. 9, D. base 4.2. #6782. 783 (8260) rounded cup, one rim sherd, semi-fine pale orange, wheelmade, smooth slipped int, with glossy ext of dark-on-light spirals; D. rim c. 13. #6780. 783a (8521) jug or amphora, body sherd only, hard semi-fine brown buff, wheelmade, polished buff slip ext with dark-on-light crescents, bands and added red band. #6780. 784 (7907) jug or jar&gt; 4 frs of base and body (two joining), semi-coarse buff with varied inclusions (possible import from South Coast), wheelmade, plain int and glossy dark-on-light ext of bands and lilies, with an added red band; D. base c. 16. #6779, 6780, 6784, 6786. 785 (7908) large globular strainer, 4 joining body frs, well preserved surfaces, hard semi-fine orange with grey core, wheelmade, plain int and burnished buff slip ext with dark-on-light decoration of running medallion spirals with added white; D. max c. 27. #6787. 786 (7909) large globular strainer, 8 frs of rim and lower body, some joining, hard semi-fine orange with grey core, wheelmade, plain int with burnished buff slip ext and dark-on-light decoration of thick bands at mid and lower body, with a frieze of floral scroll, and at the upper body an isolated spiral with a hatched stem and two tendril scrolls shooting off. #6782, 6786-7. 62 Shown in Platon's presentation at LM IB conference in Athens, 2008. 63 Marinatos 1969, pi. 25. 64 Doumas 1992, 133.

Diagnostic LM IA pieces include especially conical cups (793 810); note also fragments of baking plates, often associated with LM IA 'squatter phase' in this building. The lid 830 has glossy dark-on-light decoration assignable to LM IA, while straight-sided cup 820 is noteworthy for being a very rare example of tortoiseshell ripple decoration in white-on-dark. One may further note the interesting functional aspects of the LM iA material here, including a two-holed vase (829), and a few tripod braziers (826-828), suggestive perhaps of some 'industrial' activity. 793 (939°) conical cup, g5°/o, 5 frs, semi-fine orange, wheelmade, plain, Ht 3.8, D. rim 8.7, D. base 3.7. #6565, a7 [62]. 794 (939x) conical cup, intact, semi-fine orange, wheelmade, plain, Ht 3.4, D. rim 9.3, D. base 3.6. #5645, A6 [95]. 795 (9394) conical cup, complete, 1 piece, semi-fine yellow, wheelmade, plain, Ht 3.8, D. rim 9.1, D. base 3.7. #5645, A6 [90]. 796 (9395) conical cup, almost complete, 1 piece, semi-fine red, wheelmade, plain, Ht 4.1, D. rim g.3, D. base 4&gt;#5645&gt; A6 M 797 (9396) conical cup, 75%, 3 frs, semi-fine red, wheelmade, plain, Ht 3.3, D. rim 8.6, D. base 3.4, A6, #5645. 798 (9397) conical cup, hint of a ledge, almost complete, 4 frs, semi-fine orange-red, wheelmade, plain, Ht 3.7, D. rim 8.9, D. base 3.8. #5645, A6. 799 (9399) conical cup, complete, 2 frs, semi-fine orange, wheelmade, plain, Ht 3.7, D. rim g, D. base 3.8. #5645.

Context 18.2 — LM IA disturbance This is essentially a similar situation to that seen in Room 12: MM IIA levels disturbed by pitting or later activity during LM IA. Context StrBM. j (figs. 6.14-6.15) This context consists of large quantities of LM IA pottery washed into the Street. The pottery is very fresh on the whole, with a lot of fresh breaks in the conical cups; but the fine decorated wares are only ever fragmentary. The main wash deposit consists of rocky debris on a surface at 10.75-11.05?, with some tephra in places. This main group contains large amounts of pottery, with the total count standing at 5726 sherds, of which 67% is conical cups (see table 6.1 below). Many of these seem very fresh, yet there is a frustrating lack of joins, although enough whole profiles to show clear LM IA types (and note ledge-rims too). Glossy dark-on-light decoration is prevalent enough also to indicate a date in LM IA, although there is little that mends up to a whole profile. This context also includes a wash layer E of the retaining slabs on the cobbled surface. It looks very much like the main wash deposit, though alongside the LM IA conical cups are some joining body sherds of a black-slipped amphora/jar in an imported Mirabello fabric, generally MM II. The catalogued pottery consists of 15 conical cups (832-846), 17 ledge-rim bowls (847-863) and various other cups, including straight-sided cups with ripple decoration, and a remarkable small spouted cup (866) with glossy dark-on-light decoration that includes ripple at the exterior, and on both inside and outside what appear to be stylised fish, with crossed circles at their centre dissected by a feathered arrow motif. The use of dark-on-light decoration inside and out is certainly known at Palaikastro in LM IA, but there are no parallels for these 'fish' motifs.

There is a possibility that these relate to some early LM IB activity in the area following the Theran eruption: the curving Wall 707 appears to date to this period, along with the construction of the wall to the s of the alley between Block M and Building 7, and of course the wells (PK Wells). While some of the pottery seems LM IA, with conical cup sherds and diagnostic glossy dark-on-light, such as a hemispherical cup fragment with floral scroll, there is also some possible LM IB in higher levels: two cup rim fragments are possible LM IB, and a bossed bowl/ogival cup fragment and decorated sherds could be LM IB. This is significant as these layers may then go with the curving Wall 707. 882 (8244) ledge-rim bowl, 1 fr, semi-fine buff orange, wheelmade, plain, Ht 3, D. rim c. 10, D. base 3.8. #66 ig. LM IA FROM SW BUILDING The majority of the material excavated from rooms/spaces 19-33 *s LM IA, much of it worn and scrappy due to its position close to the surface. Context 19.2 In the area of Wall 526, 'tumble', with fresh breaks, joins, and clearly LM IA in date. There does not appear to be anything later, either LM IB or LM III, in this space. Context 20.1 (fig. 6.16) This is a narrow space between the SE and SW Buildings. The pottery includes a square rim pithos fragment, rim of ledge-rim bowl with tortoiseshell ripple decoration, some large cooking pot and coarse ware fragments, and the conical cup catalogued below. It fits the picture we have from across this sw area of largely Neopalatial material, which in many cases can be pinned down to LM IA. 883 (3311) conical cup, plain, semi-fine orange, bowl. 70%, one piece, Ht 3.9, D. rim g.8, D. base 3.8. wheelmade, everted rim, not very different from ledge-rim #3502, [43]. Contexts 21-24 In Context 21.1 a burnt floor level is reached at c. 11.75T and the pottery finds, though little to go on, point generally to MM III-LM IA. Context 22.1 has a deposit of tumble about 40 cm deep between 11.40! and 10.95?, with a meagre amount of pottery generically MM III-LM IA, though there are a few glossy dark-on-light body sherds that can be dated to LM IA. In Context 23.1 a floor at T11.53 produced a small amount of pottery, again generic MM III-LM IA. Context 24.1, material on paving slabs is again broadly MM III-LM IA. Rooms 25-27 Context 25.7 has very little pottery other than four joining fragments of a bevelled straight-sided cup, MM III in date. Context 26.1 contains a small flanged straight-sided cup datable to MM IIIB or LM IA, and a firebox, 884. 884 (3376) firebox, heavily burnt int and some burning on ext, coarse red-brown with phyllite inclusions, 5 frs joining and 13 non-joining, D. base c. 6. #1765, [116]. In Context 2 7.1, we see a moderate amount of pottery with very little that is datable to anything more specific than MM III-LM IA, except for one body sherd of a closed vessel with glossy dark-on-light banded decoration assignable to LM IA. Context 28.1 (fig. 6.16) Here we find Theran ash associated with LM IA pottery, though little that is particularly diagnostic (see ledge-rim bowl 885), except for a dark-on-light body sherd of a hemispherical cup, some other worn dark-on-light sherds and some possible LM IA conical cup fragments.</page><page sequence="240">BLOCK M IN THE LM IA PERIOD Fig. 6.16.

Context 33. j The large quantity of pottery even in upper levels seems to be consistently LM IA, with many sherds of conical cups, ledge-rim bowls and dark-on-light decorated pieces, as well as some white-on-dark. Going deeper this material continues, with some large fragments of a very large pithos, in a very coarse buff fabric, and with a vertical handle. There is also an amphora neck in what could be a Zakros fabric; and some dark-on-light pieces and a conical cup datable to LM IA. LM IA FROM NW BUILDING Context 34.1 (fig. 6.20) A niche or cupboard was found with a number of catalogued vessels, perhaps fallen from a shelf, including 23 conical cups (920-942), three straight-sided cups (945-947), a cooking pot (948) and a baking plate (949). One of the straight-sided cups, 946, has white-on-dark floral scroll, as seen, for example, in the Zakros Pits, and a feature of LM IA in East Crete. Interestingly, it was noted that the wall into which the niche/cupboard was placed was in secondary use, since its w face had been removed by the time the niche/cupboard was installed. This appears to fit a wider picture observed in Block M of cooking pots and other domestic wares being found in connection with the partial reuse of buildings during LM IA. Also #7755 covers the higher levels of EN85, which includes Rooms 34 and 32. It produces 954, a miniature pinched rim bowl of MM IIIA type, which must simply be a survivor.</page><page sequence="243">PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN Fig. 6.20.

An LM IA pit had removed the MM III street paving; it was filled with debris and Theran tephra. #5348 covers ai/2 table, with sherd material that is not too worn and with nothing obviously later than LM I. #5349 is 1/3 of a table, with little diagnostic but for a couple of rim sherds of what might be ogival cups. #5350 is a whole table, and again the latest material appears to consist of a handful of ogival cups, although alongside decorated LM IA fragments. #5357 is also a large zembil, covering a whole table, but now we are into pure LM IA, with distinctive decorated pieces, such as floral scroll and ripple (but also one jug base with dark flecks, possibly LM IB); in the plain wares there are ledge-rim bowls rather than the typical LM IA type conical cups. There is one join with #5352 (Context 49.2, see below). #5358 is 1/2 a table, with a handful of typical decorated LM IA pieces (see plate 24).

The LM IB strata seem to have accumulated gradually over this exposed LM IA level with Theran ash. In #3362-63 in which the ash was uncovered, covering more than a whole table, we see mixed LM IA and early LM IB (see Chapter 7 for definition), due to the indistinct line between the two horizons. The LM IB material in the fine wares includes a dark-on-light painted double axe, and poorly painted spirals and flecked jug fragments (the local 'spray-painted' style of LM IB), but the majority of the diagnostic finewares are assignable to LM IA. #3366 and 3368 cover 11/4 table, and we are now arguably into pure LM IA.

This flooding episode, which with more evidence we may be able to say whether or not was caused by a tsunami, is seen with particular clarity in the streets surrounding Block M, and especially in the Street bordering Block B. In some areas, particularly Rooms 6, 12, 18, and 48-50, some pitting activity can be observed, cutting into earlier levels and then filling up with ash and LM IA pottery, presumably very soon after the Theran eruption. One pit in this Room is full of baking plate fragments and seems to have been used for cooking, and indeed baking plates and cooking pots are commonly found in these 'squatter' deposits. The deeper semi-basement rooms at the w of the SE Building, that is to say Rooms 4 to 8 and 15, have more substantial deposits of LM IA pottery, often without any Theran ash; though note that Room 4 is particularly interesting for having a lower LM IA deposit without ash (Context 4.2) stratified beneath a higher deposit with ash (Context 4.1). The SW Building also sees some reoccupation, with LM IA levels identified high up across much of the area, though the lack of deeper excavation makes it difficult to know in many places quite how the MM III building beneath was abandoned and reused. The NW Building has LM IA material in a rather narrow corridor, restricted largely to Rooms 48, 49, 50 and 53, and found mostly with tephra, suggesting it had been washed in down the slope, perhaps to be channeled out through the exit at Room 53 into Street M/5. After this flood event the building sees some activity in LM IB, exemplified by the digging of the two deep wells, and some activity in the area of Room 53, for example, presumably associated with the construction of the North Facade of the Block. The curving wall at the E side of the SE Building is probably also built in LM IB. One idea that has been proposed is that this delimits the area for some kind of non-habitation use, perhaps for penning animals. Further activity in the area takes place in LM IIIA2, at the far nw of the Block, across Rooms 55-63. This 'reoccupation', connected with a series of pits and metallurgical debris,67 is further covered in Chapter 7. 67 Hemingway 1996.</page><page sequence="248">Chapter 7 The reoccupation (LM IB-IIIB) in Block M Tim Cunningham At Palaikastro we have traditionally used the final LM IB fire destruction (which occurs after the beginning of the LM II ceramic phase at Knossos) as a dividing point between our largest scale occupational phases, referring to the post-destruction habitation as the 'Reoccupation'. This is convenient insofar as the violence and extent of the LM IB destruction necessitated much rebuilding of houses and restocking of goods, making it clearly identifiable in the archaeological record.1 However, we do not find the terms culturally meaningful, as we see much cultural continuity from LM IB onwards at least until LM IIIA2. We see this in ceramic styles but also in building techniques and house and town planning, and there seems to have been no hiatus after the LM IB/LM II destruction but rather an immediate rebuilding.2 A more accurate cultural division at Palaikastro, and where we do think a hiatus plausible, would be between LM IA and LM IB, i.e. pre- and post-eruption, clearly marked by ash fall and flooding at the site. Whether or not the hypothesis regarding tsunami damage associated with the Theran eruption proves to be correct,3 one could hardly wish for a more dramatic scene change to indicate the start of a new act. This is particularly true of Block M and for this reason we will consider LM IB as part of the 'reoccupation' (though 'reuse' would be the better term) of the area. After the deposition of ash and the flooding episodes testified in LM IA contexts (see especially Contexts StrBM.3-4), façade walls are totally rebuilt from ground up on all three sides thus far excavated, fronting Main Street, Street B-M, and Street M-5. The e Wall, 707, follows an odd, curving course and shows in its rather hodgepodge mix of construction styles that it could only have been intended as some kind of boundary or enclosure wall. This is a period of very fine construction in ashlar masonry (e.g. Building 1) so this distinction is important: Block M was clearly not intended for rebuilding. The North Façade 402 is made continuous, closing off what had been open space and alleyways running s. The South Façade is rebuilt as well and only here, along Main Street, are dressed stones used. Inside Block M we see no signs of habitation or activity beyond the two wells, which stayed in use in some form (towards the end for rubbish disposal, perhaps ceremonial by times) well into the LM IIIA2 ceramic phase. There is no sign of any new building in Block M until the LM IIIAi ceramic period, and then only at the far NE corner, annexed to Building 4_4 For the LM IB period in Block M, the PK Wells volume should be consulted. Other important LM IB contexts from elsewhere in the Block were confined to the area along Wall 402 and associated primarily with its construction, for which see below. We await results of various environmental studies and analyses of soil to determine, if possible, whether use of the area was truly confined to the two wells or if, for example, livestock were kept here. LM IB ROOMS 54/53 Context 54.2 (fig. 2.56: 7, 8) Material from along Wall 402 associated with its construction, filling the foundation trench. This and Context 64.1 below are among the earliest LM IB material from the site, stratigraphically speaking, as they post-date the eruption and are part of the first attempts at rebuilding.5 Ogival cups are already 1 Cunningham 2007 a. 2 In contrast to Mochlos, for example, where after the destruction in LM IB the new inhabitants seemed entirely unaware of what had been there before and built new structures on a new plan, at Palaikastro most buildings were cleaned out and reused along essentially the same lines until LM IIIA2. See Brogan, Smith and Soles 2002, 98. 3 Bruins et al. 2008. 4 Building 4 also annexes part of Building 1 to the N. 5 Some scholars prefer to term the period immediately following the eruption as 'final' LM IA and/or the ceramic styles as 'sub' LM IA. 219</page><page sequence="249">2 20 PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN present, as are bell cups, though few of these, and the 'spray-painted' style jugs.

Ht 4, D. rim 8.5, D. base 3.6. #0765. LM III The most significant construction was the massive Wall 469. This wall may have bordered a street running N-s from Building 4 to Block Delta. LM III deposits or intrusions are common to the w of this wall above or in Rooms 55, 56, and 42/41. Parallel to Wall 469 at the w edge of the Southeast Building is Wall 563/525, which shows nearly identical size, construction technique and orientation. Wall 469, if we include the continuation above Wall 562 in Rooms 35 and 36, ran 16 m and Wall 563/525 17.8 m — starting at almost the exact point where 469 stops only 6 m to the E. What purpose these walls served is unclear. Further to the nw, Rooms 58-63 form an annexe to Building 4 and deposits are commensurate with the LM IIIA2 (Palaikastro Period XV) material found there. In Room 55 a series of pits were found together with a substantial deposit of metallurgical debris. LM IIIA1 ROOMS 58-60 LM IIIAi activity and material is only clearly testified in Rooms 60 and 61 (plan 2: Section A: 16). This portion of Block M was in fact part of Building 4. Exterior spaces outside Walls 510 and 509, these areas collected material withdrawn from use during Periods XIV and XV. There was a burnt surface at 10.45, below which was LM IIIAi debris (Palaikastro Period XIV). ROOMS 61, 62, 63 Walls 515, 507, 509 and 510 define an annexe to Building 4 in the LM III periods. Several trodden earth surfaces, some showing signs of burning at 10.37-10.50 were found with LM IIIAi-2 ceramics and strips of metal. Below this was tumbled debris including ashlar sandstone blocks at c. 9.90-10.00. LM IIIA2 ROOM 55: METALLURGICAL DEBRIS The continuation of Wall 450 was robbed out sometime in Period XV, prior to the construction of Wall 469. Both of these operations disturbed an earlier pit whose full dimensions are therefore lost and whose fill contained the metallurgical debris published in 1996. The pottery associated with the pit is certainly no later than our Period XV; the robbing of Wall 450 and construction of Wall 469, judging from the ceramic evidence is likewise still within Period XV. While a more precise correspondence between the Palaikastro site periods and Evans's terminology are forthcoming (in the volume on Building 4) we can say now that while some may argue that Period XV ends in LM IIIB it would be early in that period; and that of the ceramics associated with the metallurgical debris the very latest pieces could as well be LM IIIA2 as LM IIIB. Section K (plan 2 or fig 2.56) shows in layers 4 and 4a how the metallurgical debris was already in place when cut by the pit 4a.</page><page sequence="250">the re occupation (lm ib-iiib) in block m Fig. 7.1.

For the Southeast Building, the rooms and spaces furnished some 100 contexts containing about 364 small finds, the most abundant phases being MM IIIB with around 80, and LM IA with over 100. For the SW building the 15 contexts produced some 50 items, almost all from MM III-LM IA. And for the NW Building 36 contexts yielded just over 160 pieces, with most of the main MM III to LM I phases yielding a dozen or so finds. The Street produced little: three contexts and 12 finds, most belonging to LM IA. The small finds for the LM III area of Rooms 55-63 relate mostly to metallurgical activities, already published separately.1 The earliest contexts with small finds (few and scattered) go back to EM IIB and the latest (equally rare) are LM IIIA2. Within this time span, the most prolifically represented era is broadly the Neopalatial, especially MM IIIB and LM IA, with more localised but significant concentrations of MM I to II in the SE and NW Buildings, and the LM III A-B in the NW Building. The catalogue entries, retaining their Palaikastro registered numbering, are listed by their context according to the stratigraphical account from Chapter 2. First, however, the finds are discussed by material groups (stone, clay, metal etc.) and then by smaller classes within each, e.g. Stone: ground tools — pounders, grinders, querns etc.; Metal, bronze/copper — tools, vases etc. In the course of each of these smaller sets, matters of chronology are also discussed. In the final concluding section, any significant differences between their contents will be brought out. This report differs from that of the monograph for Building 1, in which small finds are more fully contextualised with a reasonably full set of comparanda.2 To avoid repetition with the Building 1 volume, briefer references suffice here. Only in a handful of cases where new and important insights or worthwhile pieces are identified is the discussion more extensive. THE SOUTHEAST BUILDING (OR BUILDING 6) Context 4.1 is the earliest in this building: an EM IIB layer disturbed by an MM IIIA foundation deposit, it contained a strange bone shovel (6118). Other EM IIB contexts are very small and devoid of small finds. For MM IA, the only locations in the Southeast Building are Contexts ga.i and 13.1, while MM IB contexts are absent. MM IIA, though, is well represented, especially in the centre and along the E side of the building, including Contexts ia.i, ia.2, ib.2, 9(1.2, ga.4, ga.y, gb.i, ioa.i, ua.i, 12b. 1-5, 12b.j, 12b. 11, 12b. 12, 13.2, 18.1 and 18.2. Context i2b.i has two clay loomweights, two stone vase fragments and a possible stone tool; Context 13.2, a fill, has five stone tools, and several more possibles, two obsidian pieces, three clay loomweights, a stone bead, a piece of pumice and a bone needle(?); also Context ib.2, a fill below a floor, with a stone grinder-pounder, seven stone vase pieces, a lump of pumice, an obsidian blade, a clay loomweight and two clay figurines, including the remarkably life-like weasel. A fill in Context ga.2 at the centre of the building has a more unusual mix of finds — a stone bowl, a possible pendant of shell, six flakes of Giali obsidian, a clay vessel in the shape of a triton shell (covered in Chapter 4, pottery discussion) and two sherd fragments that were used in plastering. In contrast, MM IIB has many fewer contexts, in Rooms 10a, 10b, 12a, 12b and 16, none with many finds. The few MM IIIA deposits cluster to the w, in Contexts 4.2, 5.1, 6.1, ya.i, ja.2, 8.1-8.4, 8.10, 15.1: none has more than four small finds. The much more prevalent MM IIIB appears there (Contexts 6.2-6.3, 6.5, ja.3, jb.i, 8.5-8.6, 8.8, 8.9, 8.11), also to the N (Contexts 14.r, i6a.2), and the ne (Contexts 10a.2, 11 a.2 and 12a.3). Some are substantial deposits: Context 6.3 is destruction debris with three obsidian pieces, three possible stone tools, two stone vase pieces, a clay 1 Hemingway 1996, 213-52. 2 Evely, in preparation. 227</page><page sequence="257">228 PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN loomweight and a strange pipe of clay, another sherd used in plastering and most interestingly a dozen parts of various vessels made of plaster; with the pot deposit of Context 14.1 were found three bits of obsidian, three clay loomweights, four parts of stone vases, a clay container, a plaque of shell, a piece of pumice, perhaps part of a bone 'tube' and a bone epiphysis. LM IA is the most widely distributed of all, not infrequently associated with ash from the Theran eruption. In Context 5.3, for example, are five clay loomweights, two clay spoons, a bone 'tube', three obsidian flakes and two blades, two stone vase fragments, six stone tools (most of uncertain status), and a string impression left in a lump of clay. At least three other contexts are blessed with over 1 o associated finds. In a couple of widely separated instances (Contexts 3.2; 15.2), the predominantly LM IA material sees a little LM III admixture. The small finds from Context 15.2, for example, probably do belong with the LM IA destruction level with whole pots; there are well over seven pieces of obsidian, two stone tools and two pieces of pumice, four stone vases and one architectural, two bone points and a pin, a pair of metal tweezers, two loomweights and two clay drain parts. Stone Tools Of the c. 110 catalogued items treated here, almost 80 pieces are securely identified as stone tools, with the remainder 'potential' tools. A handful could be classified as of some 'architectural' nature (for other architectural units among small finds, see below for terracotta drainage equipment). On the face of it, this is a low total: in Building 1 perhaps double the number of certainly identified tools was recovered. Breaking the total down, first by tool-type, the majority are for pounding, and sometimes also grinding/ crushing: 11 pounders, two hafted 'hammers', three pestles, 24 grinder-pounders and a possible pounder grinder/ crusher. Of those working by abrasion alone, 11 are noted: eight grinders and general abraders and three whetstones. Static tools are equally few: a quern, a gourna and three working surfaces of sundry sorts. Weights of the pierced-disc variety are numerous enough at eight; the shaped and unusual form (counter-weight) is a singleton. As well as the so-called 'architectural' group (four: a plastering tool, two slabs and a Horns of Consecration fragment), perhaps related items can be seen in the two supports. grinder-pounders These (24 catalogued, with varying degrees of certainty) form the largest group of stone tools: they are recognised by the combination of pounding damage (from bruising through to outright loss of flakes) with regions of polishing-smoothing, at times marred with purposeful scratches.3 Within these are four with all-over wear, e.g. 3343, 5844 (plate 26) and 5929 (fig. 8.2, PLATE 26),4 which may be taken with pounder/grinder-crushers (see also below). The most exploited specimens have suffered percussion damage at both ends: 3095 (fig. 8.1, plate 25) 5832 (fig. 8.1),5 at times unequally so, 5899, 5045 (fig. 8.2).® Where particular force has been brought to bear whole flakes become detached: 5814 (fig. 8.1), 3345 (fig. 8.1, plate 25);7 lesser action will leave bruises (5041)8 and slighter damage, even affecting the edges and sides: 5903 (plate 25) 5898.® The abrading and grinding activities tend to create flatter planes, even facets: 5341 (fig. 8.2, plate 26), 5929.10 Depending on the stone's composition and the nature of the work conducted, degrees of smoothness and even very low polish may build up, into which scratches become cut: 5898, 3095, 3345&gt; 5931 (plate 25). Some, by virtue of their shape and weight (elongated and heavier), could well be the sort of tool, e.g. 2923 (fig. 8.2, plate 25)11 to be associated with a quern. Because of their usual sources (water-worn pebbles and cobbles), grinder-pounders tend to be ovoid and spherical in shape (c. 13 and three examples respectively), with a more rectangular set deriving from stones with a natural tabular splitting habit (slabs and bars — six). The same factor of source influences size, in that those most suited to a single-handed, or even double-handed, grip were favoured. The more spherical items are between 5-7 cm across; the bulk cluster between 9-15 cm in their main length, with a very few at or topping 20 cm. In weight, the lesser range within 200-400 gm, or a little more at around 600 gm.

The local terrain, limestone/marble rich, has influenced the clear preference visible towards these related stones (16): their regrettable tendency to spall away when subject to heavy external force is offset by the ease with which they can be replaced. As abrasive tools they do not work, requiring either the addition of an abrasive agent such as sand, or being used against a stone with such qualities. Quartzites and the more resilient metabasites would have served better: their rarity in this set at one a piece should indicate that accessibility was limited, or established preferences stronger. The half-dozen of a fine-grained sandstone (often mauve in colour) are more appropriate, though less resistant to impact blows. POUNDERS Of the 11 recorded, the most recognisable qualities are the battered end(s), at times flaked away — the exact same features as mentioned for the 'pounding' aspect of the previous set.12 Thus, there are battered ends (3127),13 flakes missing (9889),14 and varying patterns of intensity of use: 5857 (plate 26) and 3262.15 The sides (3127) and angles (5930)16 can also become utilised. Similar considerations with respect to the shape and size of the broad run of the tools apply as for the grinder-pounders. The vast majority are rounded in form, ovoid or spherical (six and three). The latter sort have a closely defined range — between 6.5-7 cm across, and 250-400 gm in weight; the more ovoid attain 9-12 cm in length, and are often heavier because of their increased thickness too — typically 1-1.250 kg. Once again, crystalline limestone and marble provide the vast majority (10), with one of quartzite. Where elements of smoothness (5930) or faceting (5096, with six such; fig. 8.2, plate 26) occur,17 then these border on the grinder-pounder class. Two more examples (6166, 9890)18 of a more robustly-used tool — the hafted hammers can be here considered.19 5045,20 with the grinder-pounder set, could have been included — but the concavities were never fully worked. The battering damage (and occasional flaking) to the ends, with lesser degrees on the periphery, show their principal use. Their hafting is suggested by the pair of hollows pecked out at the approximate centres of the opposed two main surfaces: between 3-5 cm across, and up to 1 deep. As most such pieces from Palaikastro, they are of crystalline limestone/marble. They also come in different calibres: 6166 is lighter — some 6.5 cm across and only 90 gm; whilst 9890 is an altogether more robust tool, at over double the size and at just over a kilo heavier. PESTLES Three of these specialised tools were recorded: 5080, 2875 (fig. 8.3, plate 27) are based on a tapering cylinder,21 5902 (fig. 8.3, plate 27)22 is based more on a typical ovoid cobble.23 The work they carried out was a combination of pounding, grinding and crushing: it can lead to small flakes being detached if vigorously pursued, but more often a mixed degree of polish and scratches on the working face results. Crystalline limestone and sandstone (twice) provide the substance — the inherent grinding qualities of the latter are evident. Between 6 and 13 cm long, none is particularly large, but yet may weigh in at up to 800 gm (from around 150 gm), and so are capable of transmitting considerable force when in use. grinders and abraders Eight of this somewhat mixed group are identified.24 Their basic shared characteristic should be flat planes, even facets (3247; FIG. 8.2, PLATE 27)25 that carry a smoothness (5910),26 perhaps with a degree of polish, though at times such will be marred by the scratching that accompanies the to-and-fro action. The opportunities for overlapping with the grinder-pounders, and indeed the all-over pounder/ grinder-crushers are always present: 5873 (plate 27) has peripheral bruising,27 and 3247 has eight facets.28 6002 may be a simple lid or cover. The preference for sandstones (six, including the coarser 'beachstone': e.g. 5318, plate 27) is sensible: the component grains provide the mechanism for abrasion. 12 Evely 1984, 224-5, and '993&gt; 108-10; Blitzer 1995, 425 41; Dierckx 1998, 79-80; Carter 2004, 63-5, passim to 71. 13 3127: LM IA, 8.16, occupation debris. 14 9889: MM IIIB, iia.2, destruction deposit. 15 5857: MM IIA-LM IA, 8.13, debris; 3262: LM IA, S. 75. 16 593o: MM IIIB, 8.6, plaster debris.

Spheres and discs are easy to deploy in the palm of the hand, and thus a diameter of 4-6 cm is suitable; the very lightest need be no more than 50 gm, though more often they will weigh 200-300 gm. More pressure can be exerted when larger slabs or bars are employed, and a heavier tool assists — 400-700 gm for example. 6183 (fig. 8.3, plate 27), at over 30 cm long and 1.170 kg, is of a dimension and weight that is best manipulated by both hands: a suitable handstone to work on a quern. WHETSTONES These are most securely identified when they either carry grooves and channels worn away by use (5927)29 or are equipped with a hole by which they may be hung, e.g. from nail, peg or thong: 5047 (fig. 8.4), 3115.30 The three documented here may be joined by virtually any of the smaller and slab/ rod-like abrader/grinders.31 Given the nature of their employment, slabs and rods are the most effective physical shape: all those here conform to this trait. No great size or weight is required; indeed portability favours compactness. Thus, 5047 of phyllite has been worked by grinding and percussion to a regular enough form a little above 6 cm long: it is very light too at 30 gm. 5927 of limestone is an altogether bulkier object — larger and heavier at 580 gm, and carries a series of grooves on one face: one of U section (0.6 across, 0.4 deep) and three of V- (0.4 across, 0.3 deep), thus demonstrating it was used in two different ways. It was most likely to have been used in a stationary position — resting on a surface, for example, where greater pressure could be brought to bear on the item being sharpened or shaped. As observed, their size can be quite compact — sometimes a mere 6 cm long by not even 2 wide; generally though they tend to be 12-15 cm long, and weigh 100-250 gm. One, 3115, is of the mauve sandstone — and so naturally abrasive; the others (one of crystalline limestone, two of phyllite) would all require a degree of abrasive powder/lubricant mix to be added to them to act. The finer the abrasive agent, the more they would act as a polisher rather than a whetstone. QUERN AND GOURNA Only one quern, 5805 (plate 28),32 is known: a remarkably low total. Missing one end, and so apparently small, its weight is sufficiently substantial (at 9 kg) to indicate its passive and immobile role.33 Some doubt as to its condition remains: its upper surface was not properly levelled off: was it fractured in the course of preparation? Suitably made of sandstone, advantage was taken of the material's tabular nature to create a relatively regular form. The part preserved gourna (3224),34 made from a naturally rounded cobble of 'beachstone' (as they often are), has experienced some rough shaping on the exterior; its interior surface is smooth from its use as a mortar. As these objects go, it is typical, if a little on the small side.35 WORKING SURFACE This type of object can be compared to the quern-class, as well as 'anvils' and even the vaguely determined supports.36 Such, essentially, provide a flatfish surface on which any number of activities might be carried out. This one example (5854; fig. 8-4)37 is a roughly circular slab, with some shaping of its edges by flakes being knocked off: both faces have been used in a way that has left both polish and random scratching. Made of limestone, quite small (at 16 cm across) and light (3 kg), it will have been readily transportable. SUPPORTS AND 'ANVILS' Two pieces are catalogued (9885, 5978),38 sharing one characteristic: a shallow depression on one face, though they are not necessarily intended for the same purpose.39 9885, a small and lightweight 29 5927: MM III?B, 8.5, deposit. 30 5°47: LM IA, ia.4, LM IA and later; 3115: LM IA, 8.16, occupation debris. 31 Evely 1984, 224, 226, and 1993, 112; Blitzer 1995, 441-7; Dierckx 1998, 81; Carter 2004, 74-5. 32 5805: MM II-LM IA, 8.14, debris. 33 Evely 1984, 226 and 1993, 112; Blitzer 1995, 479-81; Dierckx 1998, 80-1; Carter 2004, 73-4. 34 3224: LM IA, S.15, squatter. 35 Blitzer 1995, 481-4 — among mortars, e.g. GS 670, 672; Carter 2004, 78 — basins, e.g. JC 422, 426. 36 Blitzer 1995, 484-5 (anvils); Dierckx 1998, 80.6; Carter 2004, 75 (anvils). 37 5854: MM II-LM IA, 8.13, debris. 38 9885: LM IA, 12b.1 tephra deposit; 5978: MM IIIA, ya.i, gravel on burnt floor. 39 Blitzer 1995, 484-5; Carter 2004, 75 — anvils in both cases; and see n. 36 above.</page><page sequence="263">PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN Fig. 8.4.

However, other than a degree of percussion flaking to knock up its form, no other modifications from use-wear exist. It goes with a somewhat enigmatic group: such have been argued before (without total confidence) that the hollow was meant to take something that rested in it (say a piece of timber — to both immobilise it and protect its end). It could also be that it was an 'anvil', whose hollow was intended to restrain the object being struck. 5978 (fig. 8.4), an ovoid block of limestone, is slightly bigger (11 across; 1.320 kg), but with a vaguer depression (3 across, 0.2 deep); it carries more evidence of its shaping process (pounding and pecking to varying degrees). A similar rationale may be put forward here too. In fact, it is very likely that these objects — though visually all linked — may have served an assortment of tasks. PIERCED WEIGHTS Eight of the cobbles with holes are known,40 plus a unique biconical form (10287). Using naturally occurring forms as collected, the shapes of the first — cylinders (5115, fig. 8.5), discs and ovoids — can cover a considerable range, albeit one that usually has a rounded profile from water-wear. One (5925; fig. 8.5, plate 29)41 of beachstone — with its layered deposition and thus fracturing habits — is more slab-like: it was found with two others of the same class (5931, 6008). The exposure to water has also influenced the position and shape of their suspension holes: in a marine setting, the stones develop incipient, if irregular, holes from the attentions of sea creatures. Some weights show signs of alteration to these: 5831 (fig. 8.5, PLATE 30) displays all-over bruising from its shaping.42 Beachstone and crystalline limestones provide the materials. Most lie in the 6.5-9.5 cm range f°r their maximum dimension, weighing between 130-560 gm. The odd diminutive specimen exists too: 5115,43 2.5-3.5 across, 50 gm; more massive is 6175 (plate 29),44 whose surviving half is 13.5 cm long and g20 gm. The perforated holes — worked usually from both sides by pecking — are often 4-6 cm across at the surface, tapering to a 'waist' of 1.5-2. Unfinished examples exist in 5925, and possibly 3391. The biconical weight 10287 (fig. 8.5, plate 2g)45 is larger: 25.5 cm high, 11.4 across at the maximum girth, and 2.781 kg. Of softish limestone, it has been pecked to shape, which has left the surface pocked with shallow dimples (6 mm wide, 2 deep). The suspension hole, sited at the top, has been pecked out (3 cm across, 1.5 at waist). ODDITIES Three are included. The first (6021; fig. 8.4, plate 27)46 is humped in shape, of metadiabase: an applicator and worker for applying lime-plaster, as remnants of the same still adhering indicate.47 Of a size and weight (L. 9.2, 360 gm) suited to the hand, one of its main faces has acquired a low polish from use. Such tools are found everywhere on Crete, a hard and dense stone being preferred. These are appropriate for smaller and lighter tasks. Second is a slight rod of phyllite (6023; FIG. 8.4):48 though broken, it would probably not have been much larger than its surviving 4.9 cm. Neatly enough squared in section, the extant end has been fashioned into what looks to be a deliberate bevel. It has been suggested to be a stylus for writing on clay. This identification is hard to confirm — phyllite is notoriously brittle and fragile — not the best of qualities for a tool that operates under pressure. The final item is in fact a set of small limestone pebbles (5820).49 They are typical water-worn shapes — spherical, ovoid and sub-rectangular; all of crystalline limestone; their size range is close to 2 cm. Their grey-black colour, seemingly due to exposure to heat, prompts their suggested function as 'pot-boilerf. This is by no means the only way such stones might have acquired such characteristics. Indeed one might expect that surface crazing would accompany any extensive employment. TOOLS (?) The 35 candidates here collected largely bear a good similarity to the shapes, sizes and sorts of stones that have been identified and discussed above — differing only in that they carry indifferent or no 40 Blitzer 1995, 467-8; Carter 2004, 80. 41 5925: MM III?B, 5.5, deposit. 42 5831: MM IIIB, 8.18, fill between walls. 43 5115: LM IA, 1 a.4, LM IA and later. 44 6175: LM IA, 5.5; deposit and ash. 45 10287: LM IA, 12b.14, over tephra deposit. 46 6021: MM IIA, ioa.i, fill below floor. 47 Blitzer 1995, 456-8; Evely 2000, 476-7, for the deliberately shaped sort. 48 6023: MM IIIB, ioa.2, pot deposit. 49 5820: LM IA, 6.4, squatter?</page><page sequence="265">PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN 10287 2151 Fig. 8.5.

Not surprisingly, shapes are extensive — humped, ovoid, disc and spherical are commonest, and reflect the prevalence of water-worn shapes; flatter forms declare their tabular origins. Generally such tools(?), as the others, lie within 4.5-10.5 cm in their largest dimension, with a scattering up to over 20 cm. The slightest will weigh but a few score gm, with the majority lying between 250-650 gm, a group at 750-800 gm and the heaviest at 1-2 kg. If one attempts to assign potential usage, then perhaps 50 Any stone that, from its mineral composition, is definitely foreign to the immediate location of its deposition is a candidate for a tool, all such arguably having been introduced to the site by human activity.

Scratches on a flatter surface (6172)54 may indicate some abrading action. 5911, perhaps, is closest to a tool — a grinder-pounder.55 The numbers of this set — close to a third of all collected — are arguably significant, in that they encourage the suspicion that indeed many stones in the archaeological record that look appropriate but carry no wear are nonetheless recently acquired or but little-used implements. OTHER Appended here are three pieces that might be loosely said to have architectural connections; to them could be added the supports (9885, 5978) considered above. Two are of sandstone: one (6181)56 of triangular shape and small (up to 15 cm), the other (5075)57 more rectangular and even smaller, though broken too. Their small dimensions preclude them from having any major structural role. Indeed, they may simply be rests, stands or even simple lids. More comprehensible is the fragment of a Horns of Consecration (5980; plate 33) of modest size (surviving height 18.4 cm), if heavy enough (4.380 kg).58 Of mauve sandstone and roughly hewn, it is possible that it was covered and further modelled by white lime plaster.59 SUMMARY BY CONTEXT An overview of these tools by broad palatial (Knossian) periods shows that two main periods are represented: the Protopalatial — basically here MM IIA (some 26 items), and three only for MM IIB; and then the earlier part of the Neopalatial — MM IIIA (six), MM IIIB (21), LM IA (36) and potentially mixed MM IIIB-LM IA (six). Also to be found are items from LM IB (one), LM III (six) and mixed in topsoil (three). In MM IIA, six or seven contexts are involved: collectively they yielded five grinder-pounders, four pounders, two pestles and one apiece of grinder, whetstone, plastering-tool and pierced weight (+ nine potential tools). At best Context 13.2, an MM IIA fill below an MM III open area, produced 1 o pieces — three pounders, a whetstone and a pierced weight (with five ?tools), together with some 1 o other catalogued small finds of a mixed nature (obsidian, pumice, stone vase piece, stone bead, three clay loomweights and a bone tool): it smacks of general domestic rubbish caught in a levelling dump. In addition Context 12b.2, a similar fill, has five tools — two grinder-pounders, a pounder, a pestle and a tool(?); another fill, Context ia.i yielded three pieces (a grinder-pounder and two ?tools). The same sorts of small finds accompany them too; all may be cut about by later Neopalatial pits. In MM IIB, Context 16a.2, probably debris from a cleaning operation, has but two: a grinder-pounder(P), a tool(?) and the Horns of Consecration fragment with obsidian, four stone vase pieces, six clay loomweights, a clay disc, a ceramic animal figurine and a conch shell. MM IIIB has nine main contexts: together producing two grinder-pounders, three pounders, one pestle, two abraders, four weights and six Ptools, as well as the unconvincing stylus. The context with the most, Context 8.5, is somewhat complex — possibly concerned with later cooking pits set into MM III debris in the course of some LM I reconstruction campaign: two weights, a grinder-pounder and two Ptools, alongside obsidian and a stone bowl piece, tell no particular tales. Three further contexts have three or four stone tools each: Context 6.3, a dump in a basement room, has a pestle, two tools(?) with obsidian, stone vase fragments, a clay loomweight and other object, and most intriguingly 12 parts of plaster vase(s); Context 10a.2, a destruction deposit in a closet, gave a grinder pounder, an abrader and Pstylus, some obsidian and two metal items. Little seems to be in any primary position, and in nature the contexts seem generally domestic. Finally, the LM IA group with a dozen main contexts offers 11 grinder-pounders, two pounders, one hafted hammer, two abraders, two whetstones, three weights, a gourna, a set of pot-boilers(P); a support and 10 Ptools. Two contexts stand out numerically; Context 5.3, a deposit associated with Theran ash, had an abrader/whetstone, a weight and four tools (?), with obsidian, stone vase pieces, 51 6182: LM A, 5.3, deposit with ash; 5918: MM IIIA, 6.1, over floor. 52 6173: LM IA, 5.3, deposit with ash. 53 5856: MM III, 6.5, steps between Rooms 6 and 7; 5912: MM IIIB, 8.6, plaster floor. 54 6172: LM IA, 5.3, deposit and ash. 55 5911: MM IIIB, 6.3, debris. 56 6181: LM IA, some LM III, 75.2, destruction debris. 57 5 °75: mixed) 12.2, topsoil, backfill. 58 5980: 16a.2, MM IIB, builder's debris? 59 Others so treated have been recorded at Palaikastro.

Overall, then, few of the contexts are spatially significant in themselves; their finds amount to nothing really beyond the ordinary and the domestic. Obsidian Just under 100 pieces were recovered — from contexts ranging from EM through MM to LM III: this is distinctly paltry, given the long time span covered. Furthermore, the nature of the material is unusual in that it contains no cores, no crested blades and very few flakes.60 Together these features make it unlikely that knapping was much practised in this area. That it was carried out hereabouts is, of course, indicated by the regular appearance of chunks (25) and the occurrence of cortex on most of the flakes here. The presence of microdebitage in very modest amounts (11 sets) simply reflects the employment of wet-sieving, which is most effective at recovering such minor particles: these are most likely to represent fracturing and splintering of obsidian pieces due to post-depositional factors (earth-moving, trampling). Three time-phases yielded the majority of the corpus: eight from MM IIA, 17 from MM IIIB, and some 40 from LM IA — exactly those periods best represented in the volumes of soil comprising them. There are, thus, no surprises here — other than the relative paucity of evidence encountered. Broadly the picture stands neatly alongside general trends observed by Carter for Bronze Age obsidian in the southern Aegean: namely that prismatic blades, produced by pressure-flaking, were the primary desired product; and that they were typically no more than 5 cm in length.61 The preparation of cores at Palaikastro, or at least their regularisation, maintenance and rejuvenation, can be surmised in part from the presence of the chunks (25). Never present in numbers, they do regularly enough turn up at any time: this is relatively strongly so in LM IA — 13 specimens, some with cortex adhering, and of modest size (up to 5 cm, but most only 1-2 cm). We give no details here as to the size of the microdebitage sets (11): small shattered specks describe them adequately. What remains are the flakes (16) and blades (42). The flakes, in fact, must be reduced further to but 10 at their broadest definition to include hybrids with blades and chunks, as the other six are of the sort from Giali (and so unsuited for blade manufacturing). None is more than 2-3 cm long, and with varying amounts of cortex remaining: they do thus represent a relatively early stage in shaping the core. None was ever utilised. The blades, omitting a handful of flake-blades, are almost exclusively from the second stage of the knapping cycle, but a couple or so with cortex exist to vouch for the first: 3061, 5262, 5981 (fig. 8.8). A further few are bladelets (eight) — determined here as those whose height is less, often much less, than 1 cm: whether such diminutive pieces were intended to serve as tools proper is a moot point: 9966 does carry some edge damage. Broadly speaking, those blades surviving are mostly fragments between 1.5 and 2.5 cm high; complete specimens are extremely rare — only four are recorded (up to 3.5-4 cm high). Slightly larger blades were at times in evidence; 5981, a proximal fragment, is 4.7 cm high. The considerable amount of edge-damage witnessed, of the simplest sort, does at least show that good use was made of them. So far as the source of the obsidian goes, it seems that the vast majority is likely to have been from Melos. The Giali pieces (5972) are from a single context (ga.2) of MM II date: three join. Presumably the material being worked was intended for a use other than blades: perhaps a stone vase? If so, it would join other examples of such from MM I and II.62 There remain just two small examples of the Anatolian' source63 — smoky and greyish translucent: 10087 from Context 12b.7 60 Compare and contrast, for example, the pieces from the LM I Artisans' Quarter at Mochlos — with its eight cores, 21 flakes and some two-score blades (totalling just over 60), of which 48 show signs of usage: Carter 2004, 91-9. And again those from Knossos of broadly LM I date at the South House (47 pieces: nodule, core, 23 flakes, five chunks, a crested blade and only four assorted blades); and also from the LM I —111B contexts of the Unexplored Mansion (120 pieces: nodule, cores, flakes and chunks, crested and prismatic blades): Evely 2003, 168-70 and 1984, 230-2 respectively. 61 Figures extrapolated from Carter 1998, 69-70, figs. 4.7 and 4.8 respectively; also Carter 1999, section 10.7.8. 62 At Knossos, Giali obsidian from the Vat Room Deposit of the First-palatial period (MM IB), see Panagiotaki 1999, 25-7; Warren (1969, 136) also traces its appearance to MM I —II in the context of stone vases (at Malia, Phaistos and Knossos). 63 Scientific analyses and source identification both have a long if intermittent history: see Carter 2007a, 142, ns. 78, 7g, and 2007b, 353. Visual distinctions are tricky, if widely indulged in. Descriptive guides are offered by Renfrew (1965, 222-47). That from Giali has the white dots (spherulites) in the black matrix; striated material is said not to exist here. That from South Anatolia is transparent and glass-like. Panagiotaki (1998, 180, n. 59) characterises a South Anatolian (Cappadocian) source at Gollu Dag as 'transparent, glass like, and of a light grey tint'; and wonders if some of the 'translucent with black streaks' sort is from Antiparos or elsewhere (1999, 27).</page><page sequence="268">SMALL FINDS Fig. 8.6.

SUMMARY BY CONTEXT Contexts of MM IIA date are fills dumped extensively throughout the area. Typical is Context ia.1 with three stone tools, a stone vase piece, pumice, three clay loomweights and a piece of worked bone. MM IIB has Context 16a. 2 with two tools, four stone vases, part of a Horns of Consecration, six clay loomweights, a clay figurine and disc and a conch shell. MM IIIB examples are more associated with destruction debris, some of it apparently dumped: thus, Context 8.5 has three stone tools, two ?tools and a stone vase. LM IA repeats this same sort of associations: Context 5.3, with Theran ash, had two stone tools, four Ptools, stone vase pieces, five clay loomweights, two clay spoons and two worked bone items; Context 73.3 with various washed silts had three stone tools, three tools(?), three pumice, four stone vases and a worked bone fragment. Mixed as inevitably these sorts of deposits are, there is yet nothing to argue more than a general run of domestic nature. Pumice Only 11 pieces were recovered, none apparently utilised. They are equally split between two main phases: from contexts64 (four with one item apiece) in MM IIA fills, and again in LM IA from apparent squatter activity (one context with one item),65 and from silt washes (one context with three pieces);66 and finally from an LM I/III destruction debris (2 pieces).67 Apart from one that seems fragmentary, all the others are natural lumps either ovoid or vaguely humped in shape.68 The largest is 6 cm long, the smallest less than a third the size. Two from the MM IIA set are in a burnt condition, which may have to do with the nature of events that created the fill. Stone Objects A single bead of carnelian (5437; fig. 8.9), spherical in shape, was recovered from an MM IIA fill in Context 13.2. There is nothing unusual about it.69 Stone Vessels70 Nearly 60 vessels are represented, distributed quite broadly throughout the lifetime of this structure: 16 or so from MM IIA, one apiece from MM IIB and MM IIIA, 14 MM IIIB and a dozen from LM IA proper (climbing to 19 if LM IA/III contexts are included. A handful more (eight or so) are located in transitional or unclear contexts.71 Two (6002, 5842) potentially date back to EM, as their deposits include ceramics of that date.72 None is complete, though seven do survive to an extent that could indicate use contemporary with the context, although, unfortunately, all are from locales marked by destruction and loss. These seven vessels are 5932 (MSV 6; fig. 8.11) and 5973 (plate 31),73 serpentine bowls from MM IIIB, and yet another, smaller bowl type, 6025 (MSV 31; fig. 8.10),74 from the same horizon; 5112 (MSV 3; fig. 8.11, plate 31), a Bird's Nest Bowl of an unusual red limestone in an MM IIIB context;75 5829, a limestone/marble jar (MSV 18/21; FIG. 8.12, plate 31) or tumbler from transitional MM III-LM IA;76 and from LM IA proper 9992 (MSV 6/7; fig. 8.11), a carinated bowl of serpentine in a pit with Theran tephra, and in a silty abandonment phase, 5243 (MSV 10/32 or even 17, if the scars are from a handle; fig. 8.11), yet another serpentine bowl.77 The MM IIA set (16 or so) include numerous bowls — from MSV 6/7/8 in at least five cases: 3069, 3&lt;&gt;69bis, 10025 (FIG- 8.11) and 3070 with 10022 (both likely MSV 8; fig. 8.11 plate 31).78 64 Namely Contexts ia.1, ib.2, 12b.2 and 13.2. 65 Context 8.15. 66 Context 67 Context 15.2. 68 Evely 1993, 112; Blitzer 1995, 509-10 for its use in metal working (and references to other purposes); Carter 2004, 110-11. 69 Effinger 1996, 25: 'kugelformige Perlen' — after rock crystal, the most numerous, with the earliest specimens dating to late Prepalatial to Protopalatial. 70 A most valuable addition to the literature is the publication of the corpus from Phaistos: Palio 2008. 71 In the following and subsequent discussions on stone vessels, MSV = Minoan Stone Vases (Warren 1969) accompanied by a number only indicates this typology; with a P or a D before a number is meant the photo or drawing reproduced at the end of the volume. 78 6002: 8.4 in association with a paved floor; 5842: Context 4.4, above a floor. 73 5932: with plaster debris; 5973: Context 8.5. 74 6025: na.2, destruction debris. 75 5112: 14-1, with a pot deposit. 76 5829: 8.14, with debris. 77 9992: 12b.2, a pit with tephra; 5243: Context 13.3, silt washes. 78 All from Context ib. 2, a fill below a floor, along with other bowl forms.</page><page sequence="272">SMALL FINDS Fig. 8.9.

They are all of serpentinite, of at least half a dozen different visual appearances (and so sources?). A brecciated mix (6141) also occurs. A possible small and spherical alabastron (6141; MSV 1)84 and a generic lid (5840, MSV 27), knobbed, complete the tally.85 That from the clear MM IIB context introduces a little more variety: in the shape of a small jar/tumbler (6152; MSV 20 concave side, 21 straight). A MM I—II context (Context 12b.1, associated with a surface) produced two open vases (5057, 5084; probably bowls): 5057 is identified as a metandesite (albeit in the process of serpentinisation). MM II contexts are attached to a couple of bowls: 5081 (MSV 10/37^), fig. 8.11) and 5908 (MSV 10/31/37, fig. 8.10).86 The dozen and a half, or so, examples that belong to levels of the Neopalatial period (MM IIIA, MM IIIB, MM-LM IA) repeat the same set of forms and at much the same levels of frequency, but extend the repertoire considerably. All but four belong to a series (six contexts) of MM IIIB date.87 Bowls large (5907, MSV 31/32/37, fig. 8.10; 6145, MSV 10/31/37),88 small (5932, MSV 6/7; 6025, MSV 10/31),89 and spouted (5973, 6017, MSV 37; fig. 8.12);90 a Bird's Nest bowl (5112, MSV 3);91 a tumbler92 and/or tankard (6026, MSV 18/21 or ?4o; fig. 8.12,); another of the odd bucket-jars (MSV 14) as well as a normal sort (5905, FIG. 8.12; 6140);93 a table leg or bowl or lamp handle (6161, MSV 10/24; FIG- 8.13)94 and a pedestalled lamp (5847, MSV 24)°® in all likelihood.

No fewer than 16 are or could belong to the broad bowl category: e.g. 6150 (MSV 8/10/32; fig. 8.11), 5830 (MSV io(?); fig. 8.13), 9992 (MSV 6/7; plate 31), 5099 (MSV 6 ; fig. 8.11), 5111 (MSV 7; fig 8.11), 5229 (MSV 10/31/32; fig. 8.10), 5807 (MSV 10/31/32; fig. 8.10) and 6139 (MSV 37; fig. 8.12) for example.96 A fragment of a spout, 6139, could belong to a bowl (MSV 37), or less likely a teapot (MSV 41). 5808 is some sort of table-top, with its feet inserted below (fig. 8.13). Yet another lamp (4531, MV 24) occurs,97 as does a Bird's Nest bowl (6153).98 A wide range of serpentinites was exploited, alongside two of a soft limestone (6158, 5092; fig. 8.10), and singletons of a grey limestone (6155) and a metabasite (5227). The singleton 5082 (MSV 10/37(7), fig. 8.11) from a topsoil context is probably a fragment from an MM lugged bowl. For their technique of manufacture, information is meagre and none of it surprising. All shapes represented were routine and commonplace even, as were the stones from which they were fashioned. The basic traces of their working that are everywhere visible relate to abrasive action partly in regularising profiles, but more in working up a polish. The exteriors have them arranged tending to the oblique and horizontal, the interiors (being open shapes, this is what was seen when the vessel was upright and in use) can be slightly better finished — a bit more polish, and less visible of the abrasion scratches. Some hints of rotary abrasion do also linger on the inside — with6i52 (MSV i8/2i;fig. 8.12), this is most observable at the base, higher up more vertical abrasion has removed any such inclinations; and on 5243. 6x43 carries a hint of tubular drill action in its interior base angle; indications of either honeycombing out of the interior, or of the adjustment of the inner profile (with the aid of 'wedging' stones). All told, this group is prosaic, though enlivened by the occasional interesting stone or possible local take on a canonical central Cretan form: as such, it is probably quite typical of the everyday range of types and materials available in the Palatial periods at many sites. Clay Loomweights 49 weights have been identified from this zone: only in three broad contexts, MM IIA, MM IIIB and LM IA, are they remotely numerous enough to carry even a little significance.99 From the earliest phase (MM IIA) come seven from fills, e.g. 5210 (fig. 8.17; PLATE 32) and 4535 (fig. 8.17);100 from MM IIIB are five examples, often from general destruction debris; and from the last (LM IA) a further 11, some in conjunction with Theran ash. To these can be added a scatter, constantly about in the Minoan levels: three from a broad EM-MM II horizon, two from MM I—II, seven from MM IIB e.g. 5988 (fig. 8.15, plate 32),101 one from MM IIB, six from sundry and often mixed MM III contexts, e.g. 5995, 5917, 6009 (figs. 8.15; 8.17 for last two) and all from MM IIIA soils,102 three from MM II-LM IA and so on. Because loomweights only work in multiples, the recovery of such in ones and twos has little interest beyond the casual, unless they possess some unusual feature (such as a seal impression). In two cases (Context 16a. 2, with MM IIB debris and Context 5.3, LM IA with ash) one can begin to entertain the idea that they might be part of a group: six flat discs and five flat discs (four complete) respectively, of varying calibres by weight. But the nature of their findspots does not permit such speculation to go far. In half a dozen other instances, three loomweights were found together: two cubes and a pyramid with an incised /\ sign (MM IIA fill, Context ia.i); a disc and two cubes (MM IIA fill, Context 13.2); a disc and two cubes again (in a MM IIIB pot deposit, Context 14.1)', three flat discs (LM IA squatters, Context 8.15)-, and two cubes and a disc once more (mixed MM III-LM IA debris, Context 8.13). In the last, the cube 5823 has on one side a diagonal series of three seal impressions (from a lentoid, with an animal(P); fig. 8.17). An apparent cube, 5431 (MM IIA fill, Context 13.2), lacks the corner holes — an error in manufacture? As observed above, there are a number of forms present: cubes (13), flat discs of several sub-types (33), a pyramid 6015 (fig. 8.17, plate 32)103 and a sphere 3089.104 The two last are from MM IIA 96 6150: j.2, over paved floor; 5830: 4.5, with ash; 9992: 12b.12, tephra pit; 5099: Jj.jj, silt; 5111: f jjj?, silt; 5229: 9b.2, deposit over slabs; 5807: deposit with ash; 6139: 15.2, destruction debris. 97 453l: I5-2 98 6153: 5.3, deposit with ash. 99 Evely 2000,498-503 on loomweights generally.

In so doing, they probably reveal that the cube and especially the flat disc are the paramount forms at Palaikastro. The cubes, generally a little taller than they are in width or breadth, have a hole at each corner running throughout the cube, and are mostly clearly made in a mould. Of the substantially complete ones, their height varies between 4.3 and 7.9 cm; their other dimensions run from 3.6 square to 8 x 4.5 cm; most weigh in at 120-250 gm, with one monster (6016, fig. 8.17)105 at 480 gm. The flat discs mostly have a single suspension hole but 5864 (fig. 8.16, plate 33), 5g88f and 6113 have two.106 In the 20 or so complete examples, their size range is comparable to the cubes: from 5.6 to 10 cm high and across, and a 105 6oi6: 14.i, MM IIIB pot deposit. 106 5864: 5.3, LM IA deposit with ash; 5g88f: 16a.2, MM IIB, ?building debris; 6113: 15.2, LM IA and some III in destruction debris,</page><page sequence="279">PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN Fig. 8.15.

Their weight range however is more varied: from 60 up to 340 gm — with groups at 60-100 gm (four examples), most 150-200 (over 10) and 270-340 (six). Recent experimental work by the Centre for Textile Research at Copenhagen has begun to unravel the tangled confusion about what sorts of tasks the various loomweights were equipped to handle.107 Using the formula developed for the disc sort, the following and tentative deductions might be possible. Of the MM II ones (relatively light at no more than 100 gm, albeit a small collection), 5434 (fig. 8.14) is suited to work a rather open fabric (six warp-threads of 10 gm tension per weight); 5168 107 See http://ctr.hum.ku.dk/.

(plate 33) and 5126 (fig. 8.15, plate 32) are slightly more versatile — they can produce something slightly heavier than the first example (five threads of 20 gm-tension, but are perhaps best suited to a somewhat denser, if still light, fabric (10 threads of 10 gm warp). With MM IIIB, the weight range here might be characterised as somewhat heavier, between 150 and 270 gm; and the LM IA set wider still — some are as the MM IIA ones (e.g. 5864), others are heavier [c. 170-200 gm), but not appreciably thicker. 5422 (fig. 8.16) 5427 and 5426 (fig. 8.15) are of this latter sort, quite probably from a single set as they were found together in Context 5.3. With them a quite densely woven fabric (17-20 threads at 10 gm tension), or a more open, if tougher one (8-10 at 20 gm; even 6-7 at 30 gm) are both feasible. 5813 could give the densest of all (25 at 10 gm tension; fig. 8.14): from a debris context, where MM II is seen with LM IA, unfortunately. If one is to draw any conclusions, it is perhaps only the obvious one that in Neopalatial Crete, rather more varieties of cloth could be produced than in earlier times. The as yet unanswered question is: why? Were the yarns processed in more ways? Or made up from different qualities of fleece, or even of mixed fibres?</page><page sequence="281">PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN a ^ Fig. 8.17.

They occur in contexts of MM IIA-IIB (six sure cases), with apparently one from a mixed LM IA context. Five are of animals, two are humans. All are small, up to 5 cm or so long, with the exception of 2948, a bull's horn, which itself alone measures 4.9 cm, and another such 5990 at 2.6 cm.108 Fine clays are preferred: they have fired to buff as a rule (some more oxidised to pink). The bull's horn 2948 was fashioned of a coarser fabric that fired quite a red-brown in hue. The animal figurines, omitting the single horns mentioned above, are all of quadrupeds, mostly indistinguishable as to type.109 The presumption is that many are bovines. Hand-modelled, with minimal details, they rely on paint or a slip to give them some impact. 9451 has an all-over dark monochrome, 6110 is black; 5990 white.110 6110 is reclining, and its legs are treated in an unusual fashion as a result: they are loops of clay coiled round back to the body. The most interesting is 9909 (fig. 8.18), which is a marten, weasel or stoat.111 Pinched up from a single roll of clay, it is portrayed in a typically lithe and fluid posture, with the head reversed to look behind it.

Located in an MM IIA fill, it recalls the sorts of votive offerings left at peak sanctuaries: that at Petsophas nearby has yielded similar.112 Of the humans, one is female (6116; MM IIA), the other male (5993, fig. 8.18; MM IIB).113 Both are slightly bowed, almost as if they were once intended to be seated. However, figurines of this date in such a posture are most uncommon: it is likely that they were both standing. The female lacks the head and part of her right arm: she holds her left hand to her breasts and perhaps had the right raised? A long dress, with a high collar was painted red; her face perhaps once coloured white. Details were then added in black: the dress perhaps with a pattern; those on neck and arm maybe represent a necklace and an arm band? The male has lost his head, and most of the arms and legs. He too is clothed, in the typical cod-piece and belt (the latter rendered in a fugitive white). For some reason the front plane was given a black wash, whilst the back remained plain. In fact the reverse is oddly flat: it may be that the figure was attached to something. Of the hands, the right is raised, the left lowered. Both are in size and type once more capable of being matched by those found in peak sanctuaries, with which they are broadly contemporary.114 Other clay objects are few, though the items connected to draining rainwater are of definite architectural value. A small pellet (5991, FIG. 8.19), squashed flat between the fingers to form a disc, could be anything: idle doodling, an intended attachment to a figurine or vase, maybe even an eroded sherd.115 Two spoons (5425 and 5423, both fig. 8.19, from the same LM IA deposit) are of fine clay and rendered grey and black, perhaps by use around a heat source/fire.116 Such are seldom encountered.117 Their bowls are around 3 cm across: the first is shallower and more ovoid, the other circular and deeper; their handles are lost. The latter is better suited to dealing with liquids. 112 Rutkowski 1991, 111-12. 113 6116: ioa.i, fill below a floor; 5993: i6a.i, burnt deposit. 114 General monographs and discussions of recent years include Pilali-Papasteriou 1992, Rethemiotakis 2001 and Mina 2008.

Next, and from the same context as the spoons, is a small lump that carries a string impression (6841) , as well as an imprint of some backing material (wood or very fine basketry?).118 It is not stamped, but is presumably part of some sealing procedure — to tie up a box or basket. The string is quite robust, more of a cord at some 6-7 mm thick: it is composed of three separate strands (each 2 2.5 mm across). The component fibres are also visible: close packed and seemingly short. Comparable is another piece of clay (10177, from an MM IIB context); this piece has had one side pressed against a piece of cloth or leather, another part over and around an ovoid projection (knob-handle?).119 The drainage channels, or guttering, are seven in number.120 All, except 10310 in an MM IIA deposit, are from contexts that contain MM III-LM IA material (also some MM II, and LM III): it is assumed that they do broadly belong to this Neopalatial phase. They are all red-orange-brown in colour, and of a moderately coarse fabric, a little less coarse than that typically used for pithoi.

Scale 1:2. 10310, from a mid section; 10311 and 10309 from towards the ends.121 Essentially all are open topped channels of an inverted n in profile: some about 7 cm wide, others double that, e.g. 10311 (plate 34). The walls are often low at only 5-6 cm high, but again the larger versions are 10 or more. They are fashioned from three long clay slabs, smeared together at their joins: fingers (10309) and some tool (10311) have both left their marks, usually on the internal corners. They are heavy — and as such would not be too readily moved from their position. In addition there is a mouth piece 10308 (fig. 8.20, plate 34): this belongs to the larger calibre pieces.122 The point of debouchement has been widened a little (by about 4-5 cm) and four grooves have been worked into the base to encourage the water to depart in slight jets rather than dribbles. But the most valuable is the complete specimen 10306 (fig. 8.20, plate 34), albeit broken into 22 pieces. A metre in length, it is not of the heaviest calibre, but still several kilos in weight. The basic length conforms in shape to the norm; it is internally 6 cm wide, and with walls of the same height. What distinguishes this is the mouth: the channel rapidly expands over the last 20-30 cm into a near circle (in plan), whose mouth is arranged to be at right angles to the main axis of the drain and the flow of water. The expanded and circular portion allows this redirection to be achieved by slowing the rate of flow a little and preventing the water from splashing over the sides. The actual mouth is over 20 cm across. In addition is 5897, also from a Neopalatial context (MM IIIB debris): a closed pipe of near circular section (fig. 8.21, plate 33), with its external lower surface flattened to give it a secure footing on the ground/floor. It tapers by 1-2 cm along its length of just over 30 cm. The smaller end has been lost; the larger has considerable amounts of lime coating it. Though quite different in its manner of working from the above open drains, this could well be the equivalent but intended to run either below the ground or within some structure. The Palace at Knossos has an extensive and developed system of such intended to remove waste water from the building.123 These make use of lime plaster as a 121 10310: i2b.2, MM 11 A, fill; 10311: 8.14, MM II-LM IA, debris; 10309: 15.2, LM IA, some LM III, destruction debris. 122 IO308: JJ.2. 123 Shaw 2009, 135-6; Macdonald and Driessen 1988, 235-58.</page><page sequence="286">SMALL FINDS Fig. 8.22.

The only other object of a similar nature (of which examples have been found in an LM III context in the recent excavations at Palaikastro) is a tuyère: they are of comparable size and shape to 5897.124 However no signs of having being exposed to heat or ash are visible on 5897. On balance, the water-drain alternative is preferred here. Probably similar in purpose is 10307 (fig. 8.20, plate 34), from an MM III context: built up of coils and more truly circular in section, it lacks one end and so its full size is unclear.125 Plaster Lime-plaster is employed heavily as a component of wall-plaster suitable for taking fresco, and also providing a highly reflective surface to assist spreading light inside a building. From three contexts comes evidence for applying such a coating, presumably to wall, floor or ceiling: two such from an MM II fill (Context 9(1.2), and single apiece from a MM HIB debris layer (Context 6.3) and from an LM IA silty wash (Context 13.3). They all involve ceramic sherds to which plaster is still adhering.126 Such could be parts of a broken pot of plaster, acting as a portable receptacle; or perhaps simple scoops in its handling. However, the last set of pieces may have yet another explanation. Lime-plaster was also used to manufacture or help adorn a few specific items: the best-known being the tripod altars,121 but note also the plaster bowls described in the following chapter; many of these come from the same context (6.3) as one of the plaster-coated sherds mentioned above. Metals Metal finds are scarce: one of gold, one of iron (a modern intrusion) and five of copper/bronze: all are small. Of copper/bronze are a tiny tool and a curved piece of wire from an MM HIB deposit with pots (context ioa.2); a punch/point and parts of a tweezer(s) in LM IA deposits. The gold sheet scrap is from a layer (Context 6.1) over an MM IIIA floor: it is otherwise anonymous. The strip of iron 5661 (fig. 8.22; Context ia.4) is from mixed topsoil and backfill; it is here passed over as intrusive.128 124 Hemingway 1996, 218-21. 125 10307: 6.5, entrance way. 126 Similar are reported to exist at Knossos, but none published.

Its purpose is quite unclear, but it was never suited to heavy work, being only 3.6 cm long and only a couple of mm across. It could thus be a cosmetic utensil. 5624, also made on a squared rod, is more substantial in having a section nearly 5 mm wide. Only the apparent tip survives: blunt and robust, which makes more of a punch than a point.129 The wire, 10171, is too small to reveal its purpose; being curved now, we might speculate that it was part of a hook or earring. The tweezer fragments 5998 and 10170 (both fig. 8.22), at least, are instantly recognisable: they belong to a quite normal form that relied on the natural springiness of the metal to work.130 The presumption is that since they came from the same context and patch of earth, they are from the same object. Bone and Shell Sixteen objects of worked bone, and six catalogued of shell are known. The bone objects are distributed fairly evenly and meagrely throughout the EM and MM eras; only in LM IA do the numbers increase (potentially seven, though even here three may belong with intrusive LM III material). Half (eight from EM to LM) are tools, one a personal ornament (pin), three/four offcuts and likely discards, with the three 'tubes' making an intriguing set (MM IIA and LM IA) of uncertain purpose. Of the took, the possible earliest (6118, fig. 8.23)131 is the most unusual: cut down from a bovine pelvis and not now complete, it looks to be exploiting the shallow curves and hollows to make a small shovel or scoop. 6003 (fig. 8.23, plate 31) is a short spatula or perhaps better a polisher: the likely butt is triangular in section (naturally so); the other end is blunt and chunky, capable of withstanding pressure.132 It could be a potting tool, but there is no reason to prefer this identification above any other. As ever, most (five, from all periods) are probably points: here four — 6101, 6027 and 5838 (both FIG. 8.24) and 6114133 — are missing the crucial tip, and at times the butt as well; the surviving point 6004 (fig. 8.24, plate 31)134 is complete at the business end — fairly robust and sharp. A variation on this theme is the needle 5255 (fig. 8.23, plate 31; MM IIA):135 this is broken at the head, but the eye is partly preserved.136 It is a thick and sturdy piece, more suited to making and mending fishing nets and never for sewing garments — hence its blunt tip, apparently partly sawn off flat. The eye (2-3 mm across) was drilled through. The pin 6115 (fig. 8.23, LM IA probably), though broken in two, still displays its ornamentation.137 Small, and evenly tapering, its top two-thirds are enlivened by having six grooves running down much of the length of the pin, evenly enough positioned around its circumference. This is an unusual scheme of decoration.138 The discarded off-cuts 6711, NC and 5372 (fig. 8.23; all Neopalatial) are all epiphyses removed from limb and foot bones of the larger herbivores: 6711 is of uncertain source; NC from a sheep/goat tibia; 5372 (plate 31) from a bovine metacarpal.139 NC has been cut and hacked away, the other two sawn off. They could be connected with the final class of objects (see below), and twice (Contexts 14.1 and 5.3) an example of each of the two sets accompany one another. 5984 (LM IA) is a phalange,140 into which a hole is in the process of being worked: perhaps to make a whistle? The final class are effectively tubes: 5240, NC (more potential than actual) and 5433 (fig. 8.23) — MM IIA, MM IIIB, LM IA respectively.141 All are made from bovine metacarpals, some 10-12 cm long. Though two are judged to be unfinished, it looks as if first the ends were sawn neatly off and the interior emptied; finally a large hole was drilled in the side (of 5240). Their purpose is unknown: are they complete in themselves, or destined to be split further for other purposes?142 129 Evely 1993, 86-93. 130 Evely 2000, 387.

All at scale 3:4. Where enough of the bone survives to permit an identification, cattle have provided the most (six) — foot and limb, with one limb-bone of sheep/goat. Some of the points (e.g. 6027) are fashioned from split ribs. Working involves sizeable tools like the saw and a drill; slivers were cut and prised away employing chisel and also levering devices (simple blades of metal would do); blades and points to whittle, pare and mark. Much was finalised by abrasive blocks (e.g. 6004, 6114). Rarely are wear marks and damage recovered: the tip of 6114 has rotary scratches that could indicate that twisting was part of the working action of the tip. The shells yield less.143 Like the bones those catalogued are few and scattered in contexts from MM IIA to MM IIIB. Of those identified, two are conch/tritons (5384, 6018) — in a fragmentary condition; and a single murex (3206).144 The tritons are edible, but also have a potential religious role: to which category this duo belongs is never indicated.145 One other item (6191, fig. 8.24; MM IIIB) is clearly manufactured: an inlay plaque, a rough rectangle with rounded corners and a low polish.146 5966 (fig. 8.24, plate 31; MM II), a pierced fragment of a naturally iridescent material, might very well be something similar.147 Seals One actual stone example and one impression are associated with this building: the former is from the topsoil over Room 10, and quite out of context; the last was located in a pit (Context 12b. 10) of MM III-LM IA. 148 The broad occurrence of shells on excavations is easily overlooked. See Hallager 2000 and 2003 passim, under the catalogues of finds attached to every room account: to date for LM IIIC and IIIB2; also similarly presented in the Pseira volumes; for Mochlos, see Reese 2004, 119-21. 144 5384: 16a.2, MM IIB, ?building debris; 6018: na.2, MM IIIB, destruction debris; 3206: ib.2, fill under floor. 145 For discussion of these shells, and a list of their appearances in the prehistoric Aegean and beyond, see Astrom and Reese 1990, 5-14.

It was made from a seal with a round face; the motif consists of four sets of stacked L's or chevrons (or angle-filled cross), arranged to quarter the field.149 It is a very simple design, moderately competently executed. Such motifs have their roots in the periods before the palaces were developed, and can be found throughout the Aegean in the EBA, with pieces being produced or at least deposited within MM I—II in Crete, even later. Being rather simple in its patterning, this piece is accordingly assigned a potential Prepalatial origin. Indeed this specimen is remarkably restrained: very rapidly the artisans began to play with the details, inserting other elements and elaborations. The closest parallel may be a hemispheroid from Tholos A at Ayia Triada: it has three stacked chevrons like this one.150 Also worthy of consideration are two stamp seals from the collections at Munich, though the second has a rectangular face.151 The ivory stamp seal, its handle carved as a seated monkey, from the Trapeza cave is close, but less regularly carved, with its sets askew the one to the other.152 That of green steatite from Kaminaki has doubled up the number of components in each set to six.153 Finally with the disc from Tholos B at Platanos can be seen the start of the embellishments mentioned before: a series of simple hatching in this case.154 This is even more the case with a 'white piece' from Porti.155 The seal proper (2842; fig. 8.9, plate 30) is a lentoid,156 of an unusual pink-brown limestone. The motif centres on a standing agrimi, head held up; it is set on a ground line, and is flanked before and behind by a vertical line (more obvious at the front). A spray of plant life grows up from the ground beneath its belly and between the pairs of feet. Horizontal, over the back of the beast, is a line (spear) with a series of eight spheres set upon it: four smaller to the left. Drills (up to almost 1 mm across) were employed for feet, eye and dots; the cutting wheel for the straight lines; and point and abrasion for working further the body blanks and internal details. It belongs to the 'talismanic' style, though appears to be more modelled than many are: perhaps the result of being made in a softer stone than the quartz-based ones usually favoured.157 Parallels to this are not hard to find within the broad Neopalatial time span.158 The closest in terms of elements present, though much simpler and rougher in execution, is a reddish limestone lentoid from Mochlos.159 The material, the pose of the agrimi, the flanking verticals, something spiky below the belly and a slanting line from the rear supporting two globes (a spear) match the essential elements of this one from Palaikastro. Also from Mochlos is a carnelian amygdaloid, where the plants (before, aft and under) all bear more convincing leaves; the spear is a simple bar.160 The body of the goat is rendered by three separate solid-drill bit heads. Something very similar is seen on a carnelian cushion from Palaikastro itself.161 THE STREET (B-M) Three phases of this section of the street that flanks the east side of the SE Building are recorded as having had small finds. The earliest is a cobbled surface (MM IIIA), over which in LM IA a flood wash was deposited, including stones. On this, in turn, some earths (of likely LM IB?) then accumulated. It is the water-borne soils that had brought along the most finds: all quite small and so readily transportable under such conditions. Nine are here catalogued.162 The other levels, before and after, had little: two and one respectively; again of small size. The nature of the flood-laid deposit could well mean that material was swept nearby from house debris. 148 5244: 12b.io, MM IIIB-LM IA, pit.

Two are blades, four chunks and flakes, and the rest bits of microdebitage. There is nothing remarkable about any of it: collectively, it more or less covers the knapping cycle. 10069 (FIG- 8.7) could be part of a fractured core, the other chunks are preparatory debris: both have cortex still attached; 10067, a typical medial blade fragment, has some edge damage. Stone Vessels The three fragments come from the same two deposits mentioned above: with more (two) from the flood wash. Body fragments all, two are from something large and open (10013, MM IIIA; and 10021, LM IA), perhaps a bucket-jar (MSV 14); the last is a smaller vessel, of some closed form (9993, LM IA). Serpentinite is the only stone represented: but of two quite visually opposed sorts — the open vessels from a predominately black version, with some off-white patches, the closed is off-white veined in black. Clay Loomweights Just one complete disc sort (9933; fig. 8.15) is registered from the LM IA wash. It is quite typical. Bone This is the sole object to come from the possible LM IB level over the flood layer. The shank of a tool, lacking its very tip (10268; FIG. 8.24), it is a sliver of ovicaprid limb, further worked to form by abrasion. Thus that part lying towards the point has been given five sides and a basically near-circular section, but elsewhere the section is more rectangular. It too is typical of its sort. THE SOUTHWEST BUILDING Only the N and E corner of this complex was sampled in the recent excavations — perhaps seven or eight rooms: this small number accounts in part for the relative lack of finds. In fact of the 48 objects collected from 15 contexts, barely a fifth (10 from four contexts, i.e. from Rooms 21, 22, 26 and 33) can be with any certainty assigned to rooms proper. Two further spaces, 29 and 32, with a further 11 pieces in four contexts, are considered as possibly having been roofed; but they, along with five other units, are equally arguably corridors and open throughways between the SW building and its neighbours (to E and N, the SE and NW Buildings respectively). Given this set of circumstances — and the generic quality of the small finds — it is unlikely that they will contribute anything of note or value to the comprehension of the SW Building. Context ig.i has the earliest dated deposit: debris from MM IIB-IIIA that yielded a single loomweight; roughly contemporary (MM IIIA) is the lower fill of a foundation trench, namely Context 32.1: again with a single find, a stone vase fragment. Most finds belong to the earlier Neopalatial — broadly MM III (or IIIA, IIIB) into LM IA (Contexts 20.1, 21.1, 22.1, 26.1 and 32.3, yielding 18 objects). In three cases (Contexts 21.1, 22.1 and 32.5) the material is associated with a floor; Context 20.1 is a deposit in the narrow alley and Context 26.1 lies under topsoil. For LM IA pure (Contexts 19.2, 28.1, 29.1,30.1,31.1 and 33./, with2i finds); all these contexts are associated with open spaces or similar, not rooms proper. The latest context [Context 32.4, having four objects) is potentially an open space: it dates to LM IIIA2. Only four of these contexts contained even as much as five to six objects: Context 20.1 (MM III— LM IA) is an alleyway, and the six objects very mixed and eclectic in nature (stone, clay, plaster and bone); Context 32.3 (the same date) was over a schist paving in a space with perhaps a roof of some sorts, its six items are equally uninformative (stone tools, a stone vase fragment and a clay loomweight); Context 28.1 is an open space with Theran ash (and so LM IA), the five pieces are fragmentary (stone tools and a clay figurine piece); Context 33./ is an LM IA room, but even so the six finds are only marginally more interesting, with four weights of clay and stone, alongside an obsidian chunk and a clay disc-rubber). All told the finds in their nature and numbers are paltry; even when a trifle more appealing, they are located more often in external areas and so diminished again in relevance. Stone Tools 11 hand tools, 10 pieces of obsidian, one of chert and two fragments of pumice make up this group: 24 items, or half the whole corpus. Of the 11 hand tools, five (perhaps seven if Room 21 is included here) belong to the MM III-LM IA spread with the rest going to the LM IA contexts. The earlier set</page><page sequence="292">SMALL FINDS 263 comprise a pounder 338i(plate 26), two grinder-pounders (3161, more a pounder; 3380, more a grinder), a polisher(?) 3341 (fig. 8.4, plate 27), a possible pot-boiler (336gbis) as well as two tools(?): 3339 (plate 28) and 3357 (fig. 8.4, plate 28). In the second are a pounder (3196), a tool(?) (6176), a shallow gourna (3379) and an incompletely worked weight (4534; plate 29). As tools they are all quite characteristic of their sorts. Of the pounders, 3381 is elongated and heavier (at 2 kg), whilst 3196 is light (at 300 gm), smaller and circular: they would have had rather diverse roles to play.163 In a similar way a differential exists for the two grinder-pounders, though both are elongated in shape: 3161 is about half the size (at 10.4 cm long) and only a quarter the weight; 3380 would be reserved for tasks requiring greater pressure and force (2.8 kg, some 22 cm long).164 The latter's material, sandstone, is more directly suited to its abrasive duties. The polisher (3341) is a lightweight example: limestone well enough suited.165 Whether 336gbis can really be identified as a pot-boiler is open to question — it shows no signs of exposure to heat or any other form of damage: though it does broadly resemble other more likely candidates at Palaikastro.166 Of the three tools(?), vague hints of some damage exist only in the case of 6176.167 The gourna (3379) is but a rim/body fragment, damaged and burnt: roughly hewn to shape, it was circular and relatively shallow (only 4.5 cm deep) — perhaps more of a mortar?168 The weight (4534) is modest in size (at 14 cm long) and weight (670 gm)169 — and surely left unfinished: the hole is only well worked on one face, and roughly so at that. Perhaps a little unusually almost all the stones are of the crystalline limestone, with — oddly — a softer sort preferred for the gourna\ a grinder-pounder (3380) and the weight are of sandstone. 10 pieces of obsidian and, interestingly, one of chert were recovered. Of the first, four are from the earlier Neopalatial phase, six from the LM IA; the chert (3245) belongs to LM IIIA2. Unusually no blades have been identified, nor are there present the general run of flakes. One is a nodule (6136; FIG. 8.6): of relatively modest size (at 11.5 cm long), it does show that raw material was being brought to the site.170 A single flake has been removed. (The chert, 3245, is likewise a nodule and honey-coloured: several flakes have been struck off.171) With the exception of 6783, a relatively anonymous flake, all the other pieces are designated as chunks: up to 4 cm at the most, they usually have some cortex present. Two lumps of pumice, seemingly unworked, are involved: one from each of the two main phases (one even in a layer containing Theran ash!). That from Room 22 is humped, that from space 28 more ovoid.172 As natural pieces they measure between 3 and 5 cm — as might be expected. Stone Vessels Of the five examples, all dating to the early Neopalatial (MM IIIA, MM IIIB and LM IA), only the one (3351) amounts to more than an unremarkable body fragment.173 And even this base and body piece has not enough of its profile remaining to determine whether it is from a bowl or a cup. 6149 is the knob from a canonical lid (MSV 27); the other three (3352, 3394 and 2941) are from open vessels, as their interior polish makes plain.174 3394 is from a large and heavy vessel: perhaps a bucket-jar (MSV 14), as could be the equally thick-walled 2941. Other than the cup/bowl, which is made from a pleasing banded limestone in off-whites and greys, all the others are the typical black serpentinite with off-white streaks and blotches. Stone Objects Two are catalogued. 3389 (from an MM III-LM IA context) is a small, naturally-holed and irregular (if smooth and water-worn) item of limestone.175 Vaguely discoid, it could have done duty as a small pendant or decoration; its apparent lack of wear may militate against this suggestion. The other, 3122 (from an LM IIIA2 context) is a corner fragment of what looks to be a semicircular object — thin, slab-like and of banded limestone (black and beige): at some 3 cm in its maximum preserved dimension, it could be part of an inlay.176 163 33®l: 2 J&gt; Neopalatial, deposit; 3196: 30.1, LM IA, surface. 164 3161: 20.1, MM III-LM IA, deposit; 3380: 26.1, MM IIIB-LM IA, under topsoil. 165 334l: 32-3&gt; MM IIIA-LM IA, on a schist pavement. 166 336&lt;)bis: 32.J. 167 6176: 28.1, LM IA, Theran ash. 168 3379: 31-1, LM IA, deposit. 169 4534: LM IA, contaminated deposit. 170 6136: 28.1, LM IA, with Theran ash. 171 3245: 32-4&gt; LM IIIA2, deposit. 172 Both NC; that from 22.1, MM III-LM IA, on a floor; the other is from 2 8.1, LM IA, with Theran ash. 173 335l: 32-3' MM IIIA-LM IA, on schist pavement. 174 6149: 31.1, LM IA, deposit; 2941: 19.2, LM IA, deposit; 3352: 32.1, MM IIIA, foundation trench; 3394: 26.1, MM IIIB LM IA, under topsoil. 175 3389: 20.1, MM III-LM IA, deposit. 176 3122: 32.4, LM IIIA2, deposit.</page><page sequence="293">264 PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE proto- AND NEOPALATIAL town Clay Loomweights Half a dozen or so span the full range of contexts associated with this building: one (3059) from MM IIB-IIIA, another (3312) from MM III-LM IA, a third (3256) from LM IIIA2, with the four others (3191, fig. 8.14; 3390, 3388, 4530) in LM IA deposits.177 Room 33.1 had three in association: flat discs all, though fragmentary. Indeed all associated with this SW Building are flat discs, but only one is complete (3191). The earliest is the lightest (perhaps 70-75 gm), a phenomenon noticed above with respect to those from the SE Building. The rest are more in the expected 200-300 gm range. Clay Objects Four assorted items are here gathered for convenience: they differ greatly in size. Two small and disc like pieces of vases are concerned: both are reused. So-called rubbers, they are some 3-4 cm across: 3200 (fig. 8.19) is from MM II-LM IA levels, 3387 (fig. 8.ig, plate 30) from LM IA.178 The latter is more heavily eroded by water-action, the other is a sherd not so affected. Their designation comes from the 'grinding' (or rubbing) actions that have further worn and smoothed them. Although from a common class of object, widely spread in time, they frustrate any real understanding of their purpose(s). A single drain channel or guttering (3234) fragment, albeit of some considerable length still at over 32 cm, came from an MM III-LM IA context: it belongs to the slightly heavier calibre of this set, being 11 cm wide, and correspondingly heavy.179 In this particular case the side-slabs were placed on top of the base, before joining was effected by smearing and compressing. The regularity of the piece would suggest that the whole was made in some form of mould. Finally, a solitary bull's horn of clay (5386, FIG. 8.18, from LM IA) is witness to a somewhat larger than usual figurine.180 Hand-modelled, it has been trimmed with a blade and then painted all over brown-black. Metal Objects Two pieces of iron — a sheet fragment and a nail, both uncatalogued — have been caught up in soils of Neopalatial date: one at least involves subsoils. They are not ancient. Bone Objects Another example of the 'tubes' produced from cannon and limb bones of the larger domesticates was recovered in a MM III-LM IA deposit (3371; Context 20.1).181 Badly broken and fragmentary, it can be seen to have been sawn out from the complete bone. Plaster Two further instances of pot-sherds with adhering lime plaster, believed to have been used in handling the substance were noted: one is from an MM III-LM IA deposit (Context 20.1), the other from the sole LM IIIA2 one known here (Context 32.4). THE NORTHWEST BUILDING Reporting on this apparently smallish structure, with nine rooms and spaces (39-47), and its environs, is in fact a rather more fractured and at times obscured process than can be first appreciated. To the N and w a whole swathe of rooms (55-63) is omitted from present consideration as they have been extensively reordered in the LM IIIA2-B reoccupation (and belong in fact more with the activities in Building 4). Further, spaces 53 and 36 are throughways and alleys; then Rooms 48-50, overlain by alley 53, belong solely to an MM I—II era of occupation. Two areas barely touched by the excavation 177 3°59: I9 Ii MM IIB-IIIA, deposit; 3312: 32.3, MM IIIA LM IA, on schist pavement; 3256: 32.4, LM IIIA2, deposit; 3191: 30. j, LM IA, surface and 3390, 3388, 4530 all 33.1, LM IA, a contaminated deposit. 178 3200: 30.1, LM IA, surface; 3387: 33.1, LM IA, contaminated deposit. This object class is mysterious. Large numbers of them are clearly water-worn and must represent material collected from ravine, stream or the sea-shore. Subsequent action as rubbers, resulting in altered profiles and flattened zones or perhaps merely traces of new abrasions, are not frequently encountered. Thus, their designation as rubbers is frankly a little suspect. A recent publication of some early Greek periods north of the Little Palace, Knossos will serve as a reminder to their wide temporal occurrence: Evely 2008, 258. 179 3234: 20.1, MM III-LM IA, deposit. 180 5386: 28.1, LM IA, Theran ash.

Perhaps surprisingly, this zone has produced the widest date range of deposits of any component of Block M. Some eight near-pure ceramic phases are involved, as well as at least as many again with wider and mixed chronological spans. Thus, the Protopalatial period has contexts for MM IA (with four finds), MM IB (five), MM IIB (twelve), and a generic MM II (eight finds) and four embracing MM II—III (13). For the early Neopalatial period the sampling is greater: MM IIIA contexts number three certain (with 10 finds), MM IIIB seven (20), MM IIIB-LM IA three (15) and LM IA six (22). The climax appears to be reached in LM IB, where two contexts produce 39 pieces: but there are concerns for contamination throughout (with LM IA and with LM IIIA2). The start of the Reoccupation is represented by two contexts of LM IIIA2 (with three objects), with three more dating MM III/LM I/LM III contributing 19 more. All told some 37 contexts yielded at least 175 catalogued objects. All the MM I—II contexts come from predominately two locales: a sounding below the floor of the closet Room 45 (Contexts 45.1-2), and Room 50 (Contexts 50.1-2) within the cluster below the later alley 53. A very little was also encountered within the drain in Context 64.2. Mixed MM II—III involves mostly the House proper (Contexts 41.1, 42.1, 43.1), and some from outside areas (Context 52.1). The early Neopalatial findspots are more widespread, as expected: seven locales within the NW Building (Contexts 40.1-2, 42.1, 45.5, 43.2, 46.1-2), a very few from the alley and disputed rooms to its south (Rooms 36-38: Contexts 36.1, 37.1) and others from open spaces (Context 54.1) and areas (Context 64.3) across to the NE of the Block. Those with LM IA elements are surprisingly scattered: none from within the NW Building proper, rather they are from disputed rooms 34, 35 (Contexts 34.1, 35.1), from a large pit over the Protopalatial rooms 48-50 (Contexts 48.2, 49.2, 50.3) and the associated alley 53 [Context 53.2). All the LM IB comes from a pair of locales across the north border of the Block: 52 [Context 52.3) and 54 [Context 54.2) to the nw. All have claims to be open spaces, which partly accounts for the contamination observed. Finally the paltry LM IIIA2 was located in two locales [Contexts 39.1, 54.3), widely spaced at the s and N borders of the NW Building. On balance then, it would be more accurate to say that it is only for the MM II-LMIA time span that the NW Building is really represented in this consideration (see too Contexts 41.2, 43.3), with other mixed contexts involving too the alley [Context 53.1), the out-rooms [Context 38.1) and the open spaces to the ne [Context 65.1). Stone Tools Twenty-seven, of which a third are of doubtful status, are catalogued; they cover MM I to LM IIIA. Only in a couple of well-enough represented phases do they appear at even modest levels — MM IIIB has four (nine if the range is widened to MM III-LM IA), with five in LM IB (also contaminated with a little LM IIIA2). Individual contexts seldom have more than one or two; the best is again the LM IB [Context 54.2), which is an open space in which destruction debris has been dumped, and so all are out of their primary contexts. Thus as no significance can be placed on what is found in any phase or context, they will all be treated together in type-groups. The two pounders are of limestone: one example each of the elongated, worked at both ends: 2109 (fig. 8.3) and the spherical 3261 (plate 26).182 Though the first is larger, at 13 cm long, than the 8-9 diameter of the other, it is the latter which is heavier — 650 gm contrasting with 540. The elongated piece proved, as often, the more vulnerable, losing several flakes at one end, whilst the shape of the other protected it from such drastic damage. The 'hafted hammer' variety turns up once (2326; fig. 8.3, plate 26): bar-shaped, of limestone, it suffered the same sort of injury at its ends — one became somewhat flattened, the other slightly facetted.183 The concavities, one on each main face, are pecked out (2-2.5 cm across&gt; 3 mm deep). Though usually a robust tool, this specimen is distinctly small and light (8.4 cm long; 280 gm). Of grinder-pounders, there exist four, all of limestone: ovoid, elongated forms dominate (11.5-13.5 cm long), mostly around 500 gm, with one (2745; fig. 8.1, plate 26) bulkier and so heavier (at 1.5 kg). This last may be in the nature of a 'handstone', e.g. 1918 (fig. 8.1, plate 25) and 1966 (fig. 8.2, plate 25).184 The only spherical example (1928) is much lighter, at 90 gm — it may well include crushing in its actions.185 Abrading and grinding tools number three, of 'beach'- and sandstone.186 Of the discoid pieces, 2147 (fig. 8.3, plate 27) is small and light (6.3 cm across; 90 gm): its status is a bit dubious, as no clear 182 2iog: 50.1, MM IB, over floor; 3261: 43.2, MM IIIB, pit with bone deposit. 183 2326: 46.2, MM IIIB, deposit. 184 1918: 49.2, LM IA, pit; 1966: 52.j, MM IIB with IIIA, debris; 2745: 42.1a, MM II—III, with floor. 185 1928: 54.2, LM IB, little LM IIIA2, upper debris. 186 2147: 46.2, MM IIIB, deposit; 1923: 54.2, LM IB/LM IIIA2, upper deposit; 1901: 65.1; MM III-LM III, mixed fill.</page><page sequence="295">266 PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE proto- AND neopalatial town work damage is identified. Might it be a small rough lid? The other (1923; fig. 8.3, PLATE 27) is even smaller, with no clear signs of use. The final piece (1901) is hemispherical, slightly larger and heavier (7.1 cm; 140 gm): its main face is flatter and smooth. If uncertainties attend these, no such doubts plague the polisher/burnisher (2114; fig. 8.4, plate 27).187 Its material is most suited, being phyllite; its shape a typical one, namely a bar; and probably once it was 15 cm long and weighed as many gm — eminently suited to its role. The main flat face carries tell-tale scratching, and the ends have become rounded and carry a low polish. Annoyingly, the potential whetstone (2020; fig. 8.3, plate 27), so designated from its bar-like shape (1 o cm long) and its material, sandstone, yet has no traces of usage, though neat enough in all other respects.188 Of the two querns, neither complete, one apiece represent the flat-topped (3094) and saddle (3359; plate 28) groups: both are of sandstone.189 Around 25-30 cm in length once, and half as wide, they are not especially thick, at 4-5 cm; they weighed around 2-4 kg. Both have had their undersides worked: 3094 is roughly hewn to be flat, the other more neatly tooled, Some degree of smoothness, veering to a very low polish, is detected on the top of 3094. The four pierced weights are divided equally between limestone and 'beachstone'. Their shapes vary somewhat, depending on the nature of the cobble they are worked from — discoid, spherical and even somewhat rectangular.190 The more rounded measure between 7-11 cm; the others only between 5.5-6.5 cm; their weights are quite low (150-250 gm; with one at just over 400). Their natural origin, often water-worn, is generally evident; the perforations indeed can be totally so produced (2727; fig. 8.5, plate 29), others (2151; fig. 8.5, plate 29) part assisted by a drill; only in the case of 1997 (plate 30) was the hole pecked through by human agency. Concerning the tools(?), seven are of the locally abundant limestone, and one each of ?quartzite and one of metabasite. Hints of a very low 'polish' get some noticed (e.g. 2135, 3194, 1976).191 Obsidian Rather surprisingly, there are more obsidian pieces (including a couple of chert — 3816, 3897) recorded than the former class of stone tools: 66 items from 25 contexts, across the full range of time phases. The Protopalatial set (21, from three contexts)192 is from one house room in the main; the early Neopalatial (25 or so, from 13 contexts) from a mix of rooms, and external spaces and pits; the dozen from LM IB (from two contexts)193 are from debris accumulated in outdoor areas (and so mixed with both LM IA and LM IIIA2), as is the LM IIIA2 singleton.194 They all show a generic resemblance, irrespective of their date of deposition: considerable numbers of blade fragments (17) and even more of chunks (some thirty), yet very few flakes (11, plus one flake-blade). Just the one core was recovered, from the latest context (LM IIIA2), and a couple of crested blades. As well as the core fragment (3916), there are also a blade (3809; fig. 8.8), whose creation caused the removal of part of the core too, and 3917, a chunk likewise detached.195 The flakes can have a portion of cortex remaining (3905, FIG. 8.7; 3915, 3912), and perhaps some usage too (3928).196 These, the chunks (many too with cortex; one utilised, 3898)197 and the crested blades (3822, fig. 8.7; 4334 and 3813, perhaps)198 all declare that knapping took place, though the distinct scarcity of flakes might argue that the core preparation was undertaken outside the town, or at least this part of it. The prismatic blades are mostly fragments: two (3909, FIG. 8.8; 3809) might be complete,199 and include the longest of the corpus, but still only a modest 4 cm long: both are from the earlier stages of core preparation and the knapping process. A number display signs of use: edge damage for 3803, 3062, 3904 (fig. 8.8) and 3812.200 The presence of microdebitage in an LM IA context (Context 34.1), said to represent the collapse of a shelf, is due to environmental wet-sieving having been carried out. It probably does no more than to indicate that at a level not usually sampled, such minute pieces are 187 2114: 5°-7&gt; MM IB, over floor. 188 2020: 54-i, MM IIIB, deposit. 189 3094: 40.1, MM IIIA, debris on floor; 3359: 43.1, MM II III, below deposit with bones. 190 2112: 54.2, LM IB, little LM IIIA2, upper deposit; 2151: 4^-3, MM IIIA, clay deposit; 1997: 55.x, MM IIIB-LM IA, on pavement; 2727: 42.1a, MM IIIB, deposit. 191 2135: 50.2, MM II, below pit; 3194: 36.1, MM IIIB, surface; 1976: 53. j. 192 Contexts 50.1-2, 64.2.

Pumice Around a dozen pieces, mostly found as single fragments, turn up in external and internal locales201 throughout the entire life of this structure (from MM IA to LM IIIA2), as excavated. They seem unworked, and thus have the natural shapes bequeathed them at their formation, namely ovoids and humped. About half are under 4 cm long, with a scatter up to just over 8. Stone Vessels Parts of 30 vessels constitute the body of evidence: once again they are located in every main phase of occupation — from MM IA to LM IIIA2. The single piece from this last phase is however eroded, from being exposed to water action: it is not of contemporary manufacture. The 15 contexts mostly belong one or two to a phase, with one or two items apiece: the exceptions are the two later Neopalatial eras — eight from an alleyway (Context 53.2) of LM IA/B date and five from the largely LM IB dump in a space (Context 54.2). Perhaps only four vessels are sufficiently complete enough to be declared likely to be in use around the time of their deposition: 2486, a cup in MM IIB (Context 45.2-, MSV 17; fig. 8.12); 3307, another cup from a collapsed shelf in LM IA {Context 34.1-, fig. 8.12, plate 31); 2i99,asmall lugged jar/jug in the street deposit ofLM IA (Context 53.2; MSV 722/36; fig. 8.12) and 1961, a bowl in a nearby LM IA pit (Context 50.3). The MM IA pieces (2374, a lid and 2373, an open vase fragment)202 do not achieve any distinction in form or material: they are both of serpentinite. Another pair from MM IIB (2486, a cup, and 2363. an open fragment)203 are not in themselves more exciting, even though the cup has a substantial amount of it preserved: of serpentinite, they are different in sort one from the other, and from others both earlier and later. Material, once more two in number (2826 and 2824 — both open vessel pieces)204 in association with the wine-press arrangements in Rooms 41 and 42, are but strays: serpentinites both, 2826 is from yet a fourth sort. One (2322) fragment from MM IIIA is heavy enough, albeit otherwise anonymous, to perhaps be from a bucket-jar, of serpentinite.205 The other (6190) is an anonymous open vessel of modest dimensions. In MM IIIB, the two pieces (3399, a bowl and 2362, a potential bucket-jar) found on floors and pavements represent yet further varieties of serpentinite.206 A mixed MM II/III-LM III context produced something akin to a bowl (2946) and more interestingly part of the rim/basin of a table of offering (1909).207 With LM IA, two objects (3280, an open vase piece, and 3307, much of a cup — MSV 17, fig. 8.12) come from an interior context (Context 34.1; a collapsed shelf); one apiece were from an alley way (a cup/tumbler, 1940; MSV 17, fig. 8.12) and from a nearby pit (a bowl, with several part surviving, 1961; fig. 8.11).208 In the LM IA/IB outdoor context (Context 52.3) eight others are known: a cup/tumbler (2224; MSV 17, fig. 8.12); a small jar/jug (2199, again much preserved), a lamp (2106; MSV 24; FIG. 8.13) and five pieces from open vessels — bowls to bucket-jars.209 All told three sorts of serpentinite are to be seen, and two sorts of coloured limestone (3280, 2227). In LM IB (with some LM IIIA2), two more cups (1896, 1899, both MSV 17; fig. 8.12), a lid and two open vase fragments round off the collection: serpentinites of as many sorts as there are pieces catalogued.210 The water-worn fragment (3x11), open in form, rounds of the total in LM IIIA2.211 Not quite a half of the vessels can be with any certainty assigned to a particular shape, let alone a certain MSV identification. Of the anonymous set, one (2824) is arguably from a closed shape, the others look open (determined by the presence of a decent degree of smoothness, even low polish on the inside surface). The 16 'open' pieces include four where some name may be attached to the shape: 2946, 2104 (MSV 10/31/32, fig. 8.10) and 1926 are likely bowls, with 2061 perhaps part of something akin to a bucket-jar. Something of the calibre of the originals may be guessed at from the wall-sherd's 201 Contexts 39-1, 40.2, 42.3, 45.1, 45.3, 46.2, 53.1. 202 Both from Context 45-1, a deposit sitting on the bedrock. 203 From 45.2, deposit. 204 2826: 41.1, MM II-IIIA, little LM IIIA2, around wine press tank; 2824: 42.1a, MM II—III, with floor. 205 g&lt;j25!: MM IIIA, clay deposit; 6190: 64.3, MM IIIA, over a drain in an open area to NE. 206 3399: 37-i, MM II IB, floor; 2362: 46.1.

Serpentinites provide the majority of stones (12) as opposed to limestone (three; of which two are of the species that is whiter and softer than the norm). Of those vases (13), to which a recognised form is more or less assignable, most types have but one or two examples. The notable exception is cups and/or tumblers with six known: one (2486) is from an MM IIB context, three (3307, 1940 and 2224) from LM IA and IA/B and one (1899) from LM IB/IIIA2 deposits. Of the cups/tumblers (all of serpentinite), 2486 preserves its handle and possesses a rounded profile, being thus somewhat similar to MSV P.217; 3307 tapers without any curvature, and has a handle, akin to MSV D 146; 1940 and 2224 are but body fragments: of an essentially tapering cylinder in form, they are ornamented at rim and/or base by groups of ridges and grooves (three and three respectively): in this they recall MSV 17 (e.g. P 236); 1896 from an LM IB context (54.2) is plain. When the handles are present, they can be identified as cups with certainty; more anonymous fragments are harder to assign. The last, 1899, has a set of grooves/ridges from part way down the body (fig. 8.12): on balance this suggests a cup, and not a rhyton. For once bowls are scarcely encountered: two are clear enough (3399, 1961) with three more possible amongst the undiagnostic fragments. 1961 (fig. 8.11) has a pronounced rim that places it in MSV 8. All are of serpentinite; 3399 is rather greener than the normal colour range. A rim fragment with an internal ledge will most likely be from a bucket jar (2362; MSV 14): see 9998 in the SE Building for a parallel — and the possibility that this feature marks this form as a local production.212 A lamp (2106, fig. 8.13; MSV 24) is a typically robust specimen, to judge from the dimensions of its rim and basin size. 1909 also has an even larger basin as a major component feature: its squared external profile and plan make it an offering table (MSV 26). An interesting, if small, jug/jar (2199; MSV 22) displays a small lug-handle at the rim, but has no spout: this last would make it a jug rather than ajar. Two damaged, but once knobbed, lids (2374, 1898: MSV 27; latter fig. 8.12) are quite typical. All these are of serpentinite, whose quite often different appearances should reflect a variety of sources being exploited by the Minoans. In technique, the vases offer nothing of interest. Their only evidence here is in the abrasion and polishing scratches (of different calibres) from what are probably hand held grinders, files and so forth. Some (e.g. 2104) indicate the passage of rotary drilling on the interior. The criteria observed throughout to differentiate open and closed shapes are not foolproof: the insides of Bird's Nest Bowls, for example, are quite regularly drilled out, but they are not really closed in form. Even so, when sufficient information is available about the profile, then something may be attempted with a reasonable degree of confidence. Other Stone Objects Only eight items occur in this category, and they are very varied in their nature. The first to be discussed can be termed pieces of personal adornment-, a seal (2240; fig. 8.9, plate 30) and a solitary bead (2323; fig. 8.9, plate 30). The seal is relatively canonical: a gable with the expected circular face, and is said to be of steatite. It was from a mixed context (Context 52.1, an outside space; MM IIB with some MM IIIA). The shape and material should place it in MM I/II (though examples go back to EM II/III): so it is likely to be of an earlier manufacture, and possibly loss.213 The motif is especially hard to decipher: it is balanced and mirror-image — resembling a segmented column or ladder (dentate band), flanked by a rough 'wedge' on each side, made up of two lines. Such are datable to EM III-MM IA. Parallels for shape and material exist, but are never common: soft stones from Knossos (Ailias Cemetery, Tomb VI) and Prassa, a hard one from Kamilari.214 Close parallels for the motif are known: from the Metaxas collection ('Knossos'), of steatite, almost exactly.215 Even closer is one of unknown provenance at Munich.216 From Samba,217 of steatite, comes one with a ladder effect made up of opposed cuts, again exactly as that from Palaikastro; to one side only sits a motif formed of two parallel lines. Better executed and slightly more complex versions of the same approach to the motifs and their arrangement in the field can be seen on another of similar shape and material, but of unknown provenance.218 212 See above, M&amp;rtensson et al. 2009. 213 Yule 1980 should be consulted: 56-8 for the shape, 153-4 for the motif. 214 CMS II.2 nos. 53 and 207 respectively. 215 CMS IV no. 25D, face b. 216 CMS XI no. 140c. 217 CMS II.2 no. 215. 218 CMS II.2 no. 310. Pini (pers. comm. to Krzyszkowska) observes that the motifs may have some resemblance to the so called Archanes script; on this last see Krzyszkowska 2005, 70-2.</page><page sequence="298">SMALL FINDS 269 The bead of rock-crystal (within a court, 46.2, just inside the entrance; MM IIIB) was circular and of a domed section when whole. Being translucent, the various stages in the drilling of the stringhole were visible as a series of steps or 'collars'. Such pieces as perforated beads seem rather unusual. Without the stringhole they approximate the items often referred to as 'crystal lenses'.219 At the other extreme in size and beauty are two pivot-blocks: architectural furniture.220 As often at Palaikastro, these are fashioned from local 'beachstone'; often they carry grooving on their interior hollows that looks like the wear to be expected from a door-post turning to and fro. In fact these lines are more due to how the stone, set down in thin layers, wears, even without much friction. It is a little difficult to see that such pivot-stones were very effective: small sand-grains dislodged would accumulate and hinder the smooth action desired. Palaikastro doors may have grated and been hard to shift. This pair is somewhat more complex than the general run. 10299, though in plan somewhat irregular, has been worked on two faces to make them more vertical; they also carry traces of white plaster. Was the item tailored to fit into a particular spot — a position where it was deemed necessary to conceal it? 10300 (fig. 8.4, plate 27) has been given a circular form by percussion; at one side in the hollow a vertical hole has been worked through to the underside. Was this to take a dowel, by which the block was further secured to some underpinning? Both were from an LM IA context (Context 35.1) — set on the floor of an exterior ?storage area. They thus are unlikely to have been in use at the time. The last four pieces can be passed over swiftly. From a floor was a tiny fragment of a stalagmite or stalactite (3158):221 of no great size in itself, it is one of a not inconsiderable number of such found at Palaikastro — but never from an obviously meaningful context. They have perhaps some value in the religious sphere — and have been deliberately collected. Equally of natural origin and collected perhaps as a curio is part of a fossilised sea-urchin (3149): from a corridor/access room.222 2195 is a small disc of limestone: smooth, but of no obvious purpose. Such might be counters or games-pieces.223 Finally is 1894.224 Of shale(?) and a tapering block in form, it is not from any local outcrop. No wear signs were detected, though this stone was utilised for polishers and whetstones; stronger versions are used in house-construction at times. Clay Loomweights Twenty loomweights were recovered, from 13 contexts, ranging from MM IIB all the way through to LM IA with some LM III, where just over half had but one representative, and none more than three. This patterning implies that all are strays or casual losses: there are no indications of textile manufacture on the spot. In this sense, all is as usual. But this constant, if unenlightening, presence also reconfirms the omnipresence of this craft throughout all levels of Minoan society. The earliest 2344 (fig. 8.14, plate 32) comes from a clean MM IIB deposit;225 three more —2882 (plate 33), 2937 and 2718 (fig. 8.14)226 — have found their way into three separate components in connection with a wine-press installation (Rooms 41 and 42) — parts of packing, and so discards. A couple (2296 and 2331; figs. 8.16, plate 33 and fig. 8.14 respectively) come from an MM IIIA context inside a storage space, another (2960) of the same date is from debris;227 two — 1995 (fig. 8.16, PLATE 33), 2016228 — were from the same MM IIIB context, an exterior space. A large number (seven) are located in levels of mixed dates: three — 2641, 2678 (fig. 8.16, plate 33) and 2883 (fig. 8.16, PLATE 33)229 — again from the wine-press area where MM III and LM III material has become confused; one (1892) is from a corner sampled of an exterior space, in mingled MM II and LM III levels;230 and yet three more (2382, 2407, 2408)231 are from the upper MM IIIB-LM IA fill of room/corridor 43. The latest trio — 1981 (fig. 8.16, plate 33), 1994 and 2225232 —are from the external deposits of LM IA and IA/B dates: the first two were from a pit, the last from the street proper where Theran ash had settled. Disc-forms are the commonest (16) and appear at all times, fairly much equally in terms of numbers. Two suspension holes are not as common as the single form, but are consistently present here from MM 219 Such turn up in MM III/LM IA contexts at Mavrospelio, Knossos (Tomb VII.A): Forsdyke 1928, 262 and 288. 220 These, apparently mundane objects, are hard to locate in the literature: Shaw 2009 appears not to mention them.

Their sizes are from the first likely to range between 7x8 cm (2344)233 up a bit to some 9 across (2718),234 so that they consistently weigh 110-150 gm. This small degree of variation persists; it is only in LM IA (1981)235 that they rise in weight significantly to 220 gm, without increasing their diameter (i.e. just increasing in thickness, now up to 2.6). Flat-topped and those further equipped with a shallow groove there turn up at any time (2344, 2331).236 Slightly unexpectedly, only a single cuboid example is known (2937) :237 Its only quality worthy of mention concerns the partly unsuccessful moulding that has left only two holes functional. Two spheres — 3340 (plate 32), 1892)238 — and an ovoid (2408)239 comprise a group more common in central Crete: they appear in MM IIIB here; these being relatively small and slight (5.6 across and 170 gm, for example) in the case of the sole complete one. The fragments do, however, imply that larger and heavier ones existed, which is as one would expect by LM IA.240 Clay Figurines Four animal figurines in contexts ranging from perhaps as early as MM III, and even as late as LM III are known: one each from four separate contexts. All were fragmentary. Two are but a single horn from a bull: 1893 (from an external space) and 1988 (street).241 Both are from figurines of medium size — each horn being some 4 cm long. Larger still is 2018 (from yet another external space; fig. 8.18, plate 30):242 another piece of a bull — part of a hoof. At over 4 cm across and hollow, this belongs to one of the most complex sort. Hollow-made bull figurines of some size appear in MM IIB/III on Crete, sometimes made on the wheel, sometimes from a mould. They are frequent enough within the Neopalatial period, and again in LM IIIA2-C.243 The last piece, 2898, is potentially the latest (LM I—III),244 and certainly the smallest; an indefinable quadruped, modelled out of a small lump of clay, and probably once all painted black. Clay Objects There are but four, unrelated, items here gathered: all are of a coarser, pithos-related fabric, suited to heavier duties. One, 3150 (fig. 8.19, plate 32), is some sort of pierced disc— not a canonical loomweight, though no larger in size than some such, nor heavier (7.6 cm across; 250 gm).245 It has to be a weight of sorts, though. It was found on an MM IIIB surface in an outside corridor leading to a series of Pstorage spaces. The remaining three items are all parts of furniture or architectural in purpose. 4604, from MM IA, is a slab of semi-coarse and sandy clay:246 broken now at all its edges, it is still some 18 20 cm across and quite thick at just under 2 cm. Its faces are flat and even enough, though rough to the touch because of the clay mix: it would make an adequate working top, though no signs of wear are visible. From an LM IB context (external space) comes a typical drainage/guttering (10312; fig. 8.20):247 only the middle portion, much damaged, has survived. Of the medium-calibre sort at some 7 cm across and with walls 6 cm high, it was manufactured by having the side slabs added to the exterior edge of the base. Traces of plaster may be detected at the ends and on the inside base of the channel: if there deliberately, it might be part of a water-tight seal between this and an adjoining companion. 2844 (plate 33), from the winepress area and of uncertain MM II or MM IIIA date (Context 41.1) is but a remnant of something larger — perhaps a container,248 Slab built again, the two remaining slabs have been joined to give an angled corner: in size it is too large for the average drain or gutter. A small handle had been affixed to the inside, so it must have been at least occasionally portable. Boxes and cists would certainly have been useful in the grape-crushing process. Bone Objects Four are recorded, all from (or probably from) Neopalatial contexts. The earliest (MM IIIA with MM II material) is yet another of the enigmatic bone tubes (2623; fig. 8.23, plate 31):249 as ever fashioned 233 2344: 45-2&gt; MM IIB, deposit. 234 2718: 42.1a, MM II—III, with floor. 235 1981: 50.3, LM IA, pit. 236 2344: 45-2, MM IIB, deposit; 2331: 45-3, MM IIIA, clay deposit. 237 2937: 42.1, MM IIIA, in/around pithos. 238 3340: 45.1, MM II—III, below bone deposit; 1892: 65./, MM III, LM I/III, mixed. 239 2408: 43.5, MM IIIB-LM IA, upper deposit. 240 For the sorts of threads worked on the looms, see above, and Martensson et al. 2009. 241 1893: 65.i, MM III, LM I/III, mixed; 1988: 53.2, LM IA, with ash. 242 2018: 54.1, MM IIIB, deposit. 243 Karetsou and Kourou 1997. 244 2898: 41.2, LM I-III, deposit. 245 3150: 36.1, surface.

It is complete, if damaged. Slightly smaller than the others mentioned above, it is 6.4 cm long; the ends had been sawn off and the cancellous material of the interior removed. Then a flat facet was prepared by slicing a piece off with a blade(?): this gave a safe grounding for the drill (quite large at 7 mm across). The tool has left a mark on the far side of the bone, from which it may be deduced that it had a solid bit. The other three are points or awls (fig. 8.24, plate 31), two with their tips largely present, likewise their shanks. 3087, the most damaged, is from MM IIIA debris fallen on a floor; 1979 from MM IIIB-LM IA levels deposited in the street; and 2616 is from an LM IA context in the same area.250 All are fashioned from tibias or (3087) from a splinter taken off a larger bone. Diagonal scratches are probably from manufacture rather than use, as they may appear at any point on the tool's surface. Indeed for 2616 it looks as if it was in the process of working the tip that the point was broken off. Plaster Two more sherds with attached plaster continue the list of this class. One comes from each of the two exterior rooms accessed from the corridor/alley 36: they are both of LM IA date — Context 34.1 where a shelf had collapsed, and Context 35.1 on the floor.251 Metal Objects Two pieces were located in external contexts.252 From the street in an LM IA deposit with Theran ash came a copper/bronze blade (2115; fig. 8.22, plate 30), or at least its tip. It seems to be of some size, but with blunted edges. Nothing can be deduced from it. The other (1944; FIG. 8.22) from dumped LM IB soils is a complete pair of tweezers, with splayed and inturned gripping edges. Cut from sheet and bent to shape, it still retains its spring. CONCLUSIONS Given the fact that differences in the finds represented and reported on here between the three main structural components sampled (and omitting the thinly represented Street from this account) are mostly in quantity rather than the nature and quality, there is not a great deal that can be made of them. The SE Building is by far and away the most productive numerically, but this is surely owed to the fact that more of it was excavated than for the other two buildings. The range of finds and their broad nature set the tone for all recovered in Block M. Stone tools of an average enough array (but oddly deficient in querns), obsidian of a kind that shows that blade production was carried out at Palaikastro, without indicating any clear signs of production in the building, scraps of pumice, the even rarer seal or piece of stone personal ornament; loomweights of clay, mostly disc and cuboid, but never in groups numerous enough to suggest clearly positioned or even necessarily contemporary use with the structure, and a few and fragmentary clay figurines; fewer still metal items; the typical set of bone points and similar, the atypical and somewhat enigmatic 'tubes'; occasional architectural embellishments of a simple nature (stone and plaster) and the more interesting ones of clay to deal with excess rain water. Nothing of faience or glass was found. The one 'luxury' here would seem to be the tripod vases/altars of plaster, with hints of painted decoration. It is a sparse enough report indeed. Either the structure, grand and sizeable enough in plan and architectural embellishment, was not much utilised in the manner one would expect from a building of that sort, if of an essentially domestic nature. Or, more likely, it was thoroughly cleaned out before and/or after its demise. The NWBuilding yielded a haul comparable in the range, type and numbers (proportionate to the amount excavated) to the structure just discussed above. The implications of this would seem to be that it was a separate and equally all-round functional unit of broadly domestic nature, and not obviously in any way related or subordinate to the SE Building, with the one exception of its less impressive architectural merits. For the SW Building; the materials and object classes encountered once again prove essentially the same. Yet their low quality and often poor state of preservation is disappointing. Their scarcity could, of course, be in part due to the small number of rooms sampled, but further factors seem to be at play: was the SW Building of comparatively low status? Or was it subject to even greater than normal clearing out after disuse or destruction? 250 3°87: 40-1, MM IIIA, debris on floor; 1979: 531, MM IIIB-LM IA, on pavement; 2616: 52.^, LM IA/B, deposit. 251 Both NC: LM IA. 252 2115: 52-5' LM IA/B; 1944: 54-2.

Here lime plaster was applied to protect mud brick and rubble walls; for floor surfaces; to seal gaps between reeds and timbers within the architecture; and to create small-scale freestanding objects and vessels. With the exception of a relatively small number of fragments, this material is of the type classified as 'construction plaster' at other sites.2 While some of the painted fragments may be securely categorised as 'wall plaster', an equal amount may be from plaster objects, of which there are a few certain examples from this area. The plaster itself yields a great deal of information about the architecture, the destruction of the buildings, and changes in technology or fashion of decorating the walls and floors of these buildings. A couple of limitations should be noted at this point. Firstly, the scale and nature of the destruction horizons inevitably caused plaster to be deposited away from its original location. When the various phases of re-decoration and deposition of old building materials and the later re-use of buildings are considered, the picture becomes particularly complicated. For this study, conclusions and hypotheses are formed through the study of material found in situ and/or with the appearance of collapse from nearby architecture, typological categorisation, and examination of the shape, constituents, and impressions of the plaster.3 WALLS Rooms 5 and 8 provide a picture of how the SE Building was decorated in MM IIB-IIIA. In both cases, fine, highly polished lime wall plaster was found in association with coarser, red-painted floor plaster. While Room 5 appears to have had highly polished white walls with red painted plaster floor, similar wall plaster found in situ in Room 8 appears to be contemporary with a fine schist paved floor (the large quantity of pink coloured plaster may have collapsed from the floor of an upper storey). This wall plaster was applied in two thin layers (each c. 2 mm thickness), and fragments are uniformly flat on the reverse, indicative of a smooth, even support (probably an earthen render or mud brick). A few fragments with slightly thicker plaster have a raised, red paint layer at the thickest edge, indicating that the otherwise unpainted wall had a thin band of red, probably at the top of the wall, or where the plaster abutted an architectural feature. Examples of a slightly coarser lime plaster still adhering to the small stones of a rubble wall were found throughout the SE and NW Buildings, especially in Rooms 6 and 64. Fragments of this type have a characteristic unfinished surface with tool-marks from application still visible. The plaster was applied in a single layer directly onto the stone support with no intermediate earth plaster layer, in some cases even functioning as a mortar between stones at the surface of the wall (10746, Context 13.2). This wall plaster was found most abundantly in MM IIIB contexts (Context 6.2-3), although was certainly used ubiquitously in every period to level and seal roughly constructed walls, protecting the walls and the internal space against weather and animal activity. With one or two possible exceptions (see 10699 and 10718 below), polychrome wall painting fragments were found from the edges of, and the area between the SE and SW Buildings. In some cases stray fragments were found in LM IA contexts, though this does not necessarily mean that there 1 Each building in Block M yielded a significantly larger amount of plaster than other buildings of similar size at Palaikastro, or, for example, the SW House at Knossos. 2 Kommos ^211. 3 Instrumental analysis was not undertaken for this study. Characterisation of pigments and plaster was carried out by examination with stereomicroscopy, replication experiments, and comparison with previously analysed samples from Palaikastro (Brysbaert 2008). 295</page><page sequence="325">296 PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN were frescoes on the walls of an LM IA building. More likely they derive from the MM III building. Indeed, the most complete scheme does come from an MM IIIB context, while also indicating disturbance: the tri-lobed sage wall painting (10765, COLOUR PLATE I a-b), was deposited in the area N of Room ig, near Well 576. Fragments belonging to this composition were also found in Room 20 (10635 and 10640 from Context 20.1). Fragments with yellow background, irregular red lines, and white circular shape, certainly part of a figurative composition, were found among the LM IA 'squatter occupation' debris of Room 8 (10762 from 8.15), and the destruction level in the neighbouring Room 15 (10753 from Context 75.2). Fragments with polychrome bands of red, blue, black and white polished plaster, were found together with LM IA pottery and Theran ash in Room 28 (10600). The thin band decoration was delineated on the plaster surface by means of delicate string-line impressions.4 A similar fragment (10591), together with quite a large assemblage of fine plaster fragments with vivid blue paint layers (probably the amphibole mineral riebeckite), was found in Room 32 (32.3, MM III-LM IA). Each of the polychrome fragments exhibits well-prepared, applied, and polished paint layers above fine white intonaco layers.5 The lower plaster layers are of good quality plaster, well mixed with few inclusions.6 Although high quality fine lime plaster is evidenced in MM III contexts, as described above, these polychrome fragments are conspicuous among the mainly coarse, functional plasters making up the bulk of the plaster material from Block M. Two fragments (10699 and 10718) almost certainly from the same composition were found in MM IIIA and IIIB contexts, Contexts ya.i and 8.6 respectively (colour plate I f-gj. These fragments are decorated with delicate wavy lines in light pink above a yellow background, in imitation of stone. Well made pink plaster, with a high lime:earth ratio (as described below) was applied in two layers. The flat plaster edge, which was exposed and painted red, indicates that this plaster was applied around a frame (possibly a conspicuous doorway or niche) or armature for a freestanding object. A third fragment with imitation stone decoration (10755 from Context i6.a.2, plate 35 a) shows thicker, less geometric red wavy lines above a yellow background. This fragment also has two layers of well made pink lime plaster, but a third layer, of modified earth, separates these layers. While this fragment may be a rare example of MM III polychrome wall plaster from Block M, the thick uneven reverse, the intermediate earthen render, and the flat edge which wraps around the lower layers, suggests, as above, that this plaster was applied around a frame, rather than on to a wall. FLOORS Floor plaster with a distinctive orange-pink hue, typically finished with a thin pink intonaco and red paint layer, occurs throughout Block M, especially in Rooms 5 and 8 (SE Building) and Room 50 (NW Building). Slight differences in quality of the plaster and surface treatment notwithstanding, this type of floor plaster seems to have been used from MM II to MM III(B?) in Block M.7 This plaster has an orange to pink hue due to the admixture of locally available clay-rich earth and lime. The intensity of the pink colour varies according to the ratio of lime to earth. Small inclusions of uncalcined lime and a slightly grainy texture from earth and silt inclusions also characterise this material. Physical properties of the plaster, strength, resistance to water etc., indicate that the setting mechanism of this plaster is the carbonation of lime, and should therefore be considered lime rather than earth plaster.8 Such floor plaster often has a discrete red paint layer, although additional red earth within the uppermost plaster layer sometimes seems to have provided the desired coloured effect (plate 35 c). While the majority of this material consists of two or more layers of similar pink plaster, a few examples exist of re-decoration: layers of pink plaster above white and vice versa (see plate 35 b), as well as layers of lime plaster with blue-grey hue (from inclusions of ash?) above and below pink plaster. Individual fragments were found in various contexts throughout the SE Building. A small 4 String-lines: the impression left on the plaster surface by snapping a taut piece of string against newly applied (wet) plaster. Cameron discusses how use of the string-iine, first appearing at MM IIA Knossos, led to a more 'mature' phase of Minoan wall painting (1976, 16-20). From MM III onwards, string-lines become an almost ubiquitous feature: see Brysbaert (2004, table 6-2) showing 14 out of 16 sites around the Aegean yielded fragments with string-line impressions. 5 Intonaco: a fine layer of plaster applied above a levelling layer (arriccio), to create a smooth surface for painting. With the a fresco technique, pigments are applied while this layer is still wet, and adhere due to the carbonation (setting) of the lime plaster. 6 Inclusions, or fillers: inorganic materials such as sand, pebbles, crushed ceramic etc., and organic materials such as animal hair, chopped vegetal matter, which modify the properties of the lime plaster (drying time/condition, prevention of cracking, thermal/ hygral behaviour) and add bulk to the slaked lime. 7 In fact, there is pink lime plaster from an EM III-MM IA building on Kastri (PK VI, 272, 274 n. 55). This is discussed by Cameron who goes on to describe the occurrence of such plasters until MM III (Cameron 1976, 13). 8 A few examples occur throughout Block M of a material with similar appearance but much lower lime content (i.e. the setting mechanism of the plaster is evaporation of water from the earth), this type is considered to be earth plaster.</page><page sequence="326">PLASTER FINDS FROM BLOCK M 297 assemblage of fragments with a well-polished grey-blue layer above a pink layer come from probable LM IA contexts from Room 12 (Contexts i2b.n-i2)? The addition of certain inorganic materials to the lime almost certainly served a function above the aesthetic results of these admixtures; siliceous earths, burnt clay, ash from certain plants, and volcanic ash have pozzolanic properties when mixed with lime,10 thereby producing more durable plaster which sets more rapidly. Other floor plasters from Block M are found much less abundantly, and are predominantly of thick lime plaster with rough, unfinished surfaces, containing medium-large sized inclusions of unsorted pebbles. These were probably from external areas, such as the four large fragments with no evident surfaces, and large-scale pebble inclusions from Room 19 (10586).11 A very finely made floor plaster was found in Room 32 (since this room was paved with schist this material must have been re deposited), consisting of a thick layer with stone and clay inclusions (up to 1.5 cm length), well mixed and durable. Above this is a finer layer with a very high concentration of very small chunks of painted plaster (blue and pink), and small black sand/gravel. The inclusions are visible in the surface, which is well polished, creating a delicate 'mosaic' effect (#10612). CEILING/CONSTRUCTION Very little material from Block M can be securely categorised as ceiling material. There are none of the thick, low mass fragments with linear reed impressions that occur at other sites.12 A few fragments preserve impressions of thin reeds, especially from the NW Building. However, these fragments are frequently of fairly high quality plaster (for example 10648 from Context 35.1), and are not the porous plaster with low mass typically associated with ceiling construction. These amorphous fragments also curve slightly, as though around a circular support, and exhibit impressions on at least three surfaces, possibly from a combination of timber and reeds. The frequent use of plaster for structural purposes complicates the identification of the architectural role of certain fragments. In Room 8 alone, plaster is used to support wooden posts; as floor interstices; to hold liquids in both channel and basin; and to cover walls, floors and steps. There may be many other uses of plaster as yet undetermined. The NW Building provides examples of some of the ways in which plaster was modified according to its intended function. From Room 42, a plaster-lined tank formed part of the winemaking apparatus. This plaster was applied in multiple thin layers (possibly maintained periodically with the addition of a new layer) of a coarse, but well-mixed plaster with fine organic (animal hair?) and inorganic (silt/earth) inclusions for durability. Although un-polished, the surface is not porous and deteriorated as seen on other fragments, and would have provided a tough, water-resistant finish (10652, plate 36 a). The amorphous mass of plaster from Room 43 presents something of a mystery; it does not have the appearance of having been applied; rather it seems to have been stored prior to application. However, once slaked (addition of water to calcined lime) and mixed with filling materials (in this case sand and re-cycled large-sized fragments of painted plaster) this would have to be stored with an excess of water and absence of air, and no such container was found. Alternatively, excess plaster may have been discarded here after application elsewhere. Whatever the actual, or intended function of this plaster, of interest is the inclusion of a high concentration of large fragments of old painted plaster to create a coarse, durable material suitable for floors, packing/ stabilising, or for small structures (plate 35 f). OBJECTS Fragments from at least three plaster vessels were found in Block M. The most complete vessel (10696, plate 36 c) came from Context 6.3, a possible MM IIIB fill (together with the base of a second vessel, 10690). This vessel, a rounded bowl, was constructed around a mould, probably unfired clay, and a finer plaster layer was applied later, both inside and out, to produce a smooth finish. The surface is very deteriorated, but traces of red pigment on the rim and handle indicate that the vessel was originally 9 A similarly exposed, polished grey-blue plaster layer, applied above a red painted white plaster, was found in the House of the Metal Merchant, Mochlos. This is likely LM IA wall plaster (personal observation). Fragments of red painted pink plaster above an older layer of white plaster were also found. I thank J. Soles for permission to study this material. 10 Pozzolana: 'Materials which, though not cementitious in themselves, contain constituents which will combine with lime at ordinary temperatures in the presence of water to form stable insoluble compounds possessing cementing properties' (after Lea 197°, 414). 11 A much lower concentration of pebbles, and of smaller size, are visible on the floor surfaces from Block M than on the tarazzfl floor plasters at, for example Kato Zakros (see Shaw 2009, 149-50, fig. 258). They resemble, rather, certain LM I examples from Knossos which Cameron terms 'floor cement' (Cameron 1976, 213 fig. 37A). 12 Such as the SW House, Knossos (Koehl and Westlake, in preparation).</page><page sequence="327">298 PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN painted. The plaster is of a high quality, with few, small inclusions of organic matter and silt/sand. A third vessel (with base and few fragments from the sides) comes from the area of room 44 (10764, plate 36 b). With a smaller, more delicate base (7 cm diameter), and fine black paint layer with overlying decoration in yellow, this vessel seems to be a more decorative, less functional object than the bowl. It was constructed in the same way, with two outer layers of extremely fine white lime plaster applied around a slightly thicker internal layer. Traces of blue pigment are visible on the interior of the vessel, and even the exterior surface of the base was painted. Throughout Block M, numerous fragments occur with the characteristic curves and shapes of freestanding plastered objects. Some of these objects seem to be purely functional, such as the plaster lined tank discussed above, and the highly polished, but unpainted fragment from around the rim of a tank or box (10651 from 40.2). Other plaster objects, while painted, appear to have been made to withstand fairly robust use. A group of fragments of thick, durable plaster with high concentration of organic inclusions, and rich purple-red paint layer (10689, from Context 6.3), join to form the corner of a small straight-edged object (possibly a hearth?). More ornately decorated objects were also in use, as seen in the extremely fine, edge fragments, also found in Context 6.3 (10693, PLATE 35 dj- Plaster was applied around an armature, probably earthen. A fine intonaco layer was then applied, and painted with a range of pigments (black, blue, red and yellow). These fragments, from the edge of a straight-edged object, (offering table?), show a high level of skill in the production of high quality plaster objects. A circular (table?) edge is also represented (10669 from Context 49.2), as well as a solid plaster, cone-shaped table leg (10766 from 8.8, plate 35 e) of the type seen frequently in association with curved and painted edge fragments.13 SUMMARY Plaster was used extensively throughout the buildings in Block M, for a wide range of functions. This is seen particularly in MM III contexts. Knowledge of the materials and techniques available to modify this material, according to the desired physical properties, is exemplified through the addition of various organic and inorganic inclusions. Although evidence for polychrome wall surfaces before LM IA is scarce, the typical Bronze Age palette of carbon black,14 blue amphibole, Egyptian Blue (possibly),15 and red and yellow ochre, is seen on freestanding plaster objects of fairly high quality. The following catalogue details the inventoried plaster finds from each context. Those fragments which were found to be representative of a particular category of plaster, or which were anomalous in terms of shape, size, plaster constituents, or pigments, were given a unique inventory number. Otherwise fragments of the same type were sorted, counted, and, where relevant, are described within summaries of rooms and/or contexts. CATALOGUE OF BLOCK M PLASTER SE Building Although a large quantity of plaster was found in the SE Building, much of this material may be categorised into 3 or 4 plaster 'types'. The overall impression is of a building in which lime plaster was used abundantly — to fill gaps and cover rubble walls, to create flat, cleanable floor surfaces, to stabilise and adhere shelves and small architectural features and ceiling materials. The use of different types of inclusions demonstrates a knowledge of the technology of making fine and durable lime plasters, for any function. However, very little evidence of polychrome surfaces has been found, and the few figurative fragments from this building were not found in secure contexts. Where polychrome fragments occur, the shapes and curves of the fragments generally indicate that they belong to plastered objects, rather than architecture. room 1 Context 1 a. 1 Quite a large amount of coarse but well-made plaster was found in this context, presumably originally from nearby walls (and ceilings?). 13 Kommos V (751-69, pi. 4: 32-38); for examples from Rnossos (Trial KV, MM IIB), see Popham 1974. 14 Some fragments appear to have paint layers of the less common manganese black pigment. 15 Contrary to expectations following examination with a stereomicroscope, using Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy, Brysbaert found evidence for an amphibole mineral (riebeckite or glaucophane), rather than cuprorivaite (Egyptian blue) in the blue samples from Palaikastro (Brysbaert et al., 2006, 1098-g).</page><page sequence="328">PLASTER FINDS FROM BLOCK M 299 10680 4 fragments of construction plaster: 1 fragment layer of plaster adhering to small stone; 1 with fine with single plaster layer containing large inclusions of clay- uppermost layer above thicker layer, very uneven on rich earth, smooth but un-worked surface; 1 with two distinct reverse, low mass. plaster layers of even thickness and smooth surface; 1 single Context id.j A few small fragments of floor plaster survive from this context. These contain a high concentration of evenly distributed sand, finely chopped organic material, and small pieces of clay-rich earth. Some of these fragments preserve traces of a vivid orange paint layer, above a fine intonaco layer. Context ia.4 Wall plaster was found throughout this context, in fairly large quantities. This material is consistently broken into very small fragments, and has a characteristic highly polished finish, predominantly unpainted surface (although two or three fragments, probably from the uppermost section of a wall, have traces of red pigment at one edge), frequently two thin plaster layers of fine, well-made plaster, and are smooth on the reverse. Also from this context are approximately 30 fragments of pink plaster with smooth, orange-red surfaces and two plaster layers representing two phases of decoration. Due to the nature of this context, however, it seems probable that this material has been re-deposited from elsewhere in the site, especially in view of the vast amounts of pink plaster found in various locations in the SE Building. Context ia.5 10681 Fragment with similar composition to fragments found in the SW Building, with a red and black band delineated with string-lines and separated by a thin band Context ib. 2 The fill produced a number of fragments of construction plaster, including lime plaster adhering to mud brick and stone, and fragments of coarse lime plaster with curved surfaces from application around architectural features. Plaster here tends to be coarser than that found elsewhere in the SE Building, with a higher concentration of sand and vegetal inclusions. It is likely that some of this material comes from the plaster floor above (Context ib.3), from which material was not available for study. In particular, fragments with a high concentration of silt/sand and pieces of clay-rich earth (10694) resemble the floor material from Context ia.3. 10694 2 fragments of coarse grainy plaster with large inclusions of a hard clay-like material ROOM 2 Context 2.2 The pink coloured plaster, found frequently as floor material in the SE Building and in some rooms of the NW, is fairly consistently made in the same way (clay-rich earth and uncalcined calcium carbonate inclusions within the hydrated lime matrix). However, small differences may be observed, even within the same context. In Room 2, the conventional lime and earth plaster was also applied on the walls, but modifications were made to create a finer finish — a fine white intonaco layer was applied above a single layer of pink plaster, giving a more vibrant hue to the overlying red paint layer than is typically seen in this building. This plaster was applied above an earthen render, traces of which still adhere to the reverse of many of the fragments. Fragments from the floor consist of two thin layers of durable pink plaster. The surfaces are deteriorated, but it appears that no white intonaco layer was applied. room 4 Context 4.3 10683 High quality, well polished red paint layer above surface, indicative of re-decoration, with distinctive a thick pink intonaco and pink coloured plaster.

Although it is not possible to calculate the period of time that elapsed between phases of decoration, it is interesting to see such a clear picture of the re-decoration, and the reasons behind doing so. ROOM 5 Context 5. i 10684 Fragment with inward right-angled curve, demonstrative of its location around a shelf, bench or straight-sided object. It is of highly polished, good quality plaster with few inclusions. Context 5.2 Approximately 265 fragments (range of sizes: 6 x 4 x 0.5 - 2 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm) with the same plaster type, thickness and surface treatment were found in this context. These are representative of a type of plaster found throughout the SE Building. These fragments are of thin white plaster, with smooth worked surfaces. Fine tool-marks from polishing are visible under raking light. The plaster appears to have been applied in two thin layers above a mud brick support, and is fairly pure with few visible inclusions. Some fragments have an area of impasto red pigment towards one edge, probably from the top of a (otherwise unpainted?) wall. Approximately 140 fragments of dense, well-made pink floor plaster, mostly with red paint layer were found in this context. These have 2-3 layers of plaster of mostly equal thickness and similar constituents (range of sizes: 7.5 x 6 x 0.8 - 2 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm). 10685 Example of thin polished white plaster with red painted band Context 5.3 10686 2 fragments of unique type of floor plaster with thick lower layer of plaster with high concentration of quartz and earth inclusions. A thin layer applied above provides a smooth finish despite the presence of (smaller) inclusions of the same type. This is a coarse, durable plaster, suitable for a structural or load-bearing function. 10687 Large fragment with downwards right-angled curve, from a plastered shelf or niche. The surface curves upwards at one end, probably towards a wall. This is good quality plaster with finely chopped organic (possibly animal hair) inclusions. The highly polished surface suggests that this was either in a conspicuous location, or was possibly used to store something such as food, since most construction plaster from this building is fairly coarse and unfinished on the surface.

Context 6.2 10697 4 fragments of plaster still adhering to small stone supports, presumably from collapsed rubble wall. A single layer of quite fine white lime plaster survives in each case, and the surfaces appear to have been left un-worked, with visible toolmarks from application. Although such plaster is fairly standard for finishing walls, it is worth noting that fragments of a very similar type, thickness, and surface treatment have been found adhering to small irregular shaped stones throughout Block M, especially from the NW Building. 10798 large fragment (7 x 6 x 2.5 cm) with finely ground red pigment above thick uneven white plaster, possibly from upper section of a wall. Context 6.3 All of the material from this context is particularly deteriorated and powdery, consistent with the idea of frequent flooding events in this area. Similarly, the large number of plaster objects broken in antiquity, and disparate fragments of construction plaster found here, support the idea of an intentional fill. 10695 Fragment with vivid blue paint layer, probably a the pigments applied above a fine white intonaco layer, mixture of Egyptian blue and amphibole, with two overlying 10696 Fragments of rim, base, and two handles from a bands of yellow (iron oxide).

These fragments are polished on</page><page sequence="330">PLASTER FINDS FROM BLOCK M both surfaces, and consist of an inner layer of fine lime plaster with a low concentration of inclusions of small silt/ sand and fine organics, and thin finishing layer on interior and exterior of vessel. D. rim c. 42. 10691 Fragment with triangular profile, probably from around a frame. Traces of blue pigment remain on one surface, while faint impressions on the other two long edges suggest this plaster was applied between a wall and a wooden frame. 10689 An unusual group of joining fragments forming a large straight-edged object (18.5 x 12 x 4 cm). The paint layer has a distinctive purple-red hue, which appears to be the result of a thin layer of red pigment in lime above a layer with a higher concentration of pigment. This object was highly polished and well constructed. Below the fine white intonaco layer is a thicker plaster layer with a few organic inclusions, which is loosely adhered to a second, coarser layer, very uneven on reverse. Two perpendicular flat edges suggest this was a plaster table or bench, although a solid plaster object would be extremely difficult to construct, and the lower layer does not curve as though applied around an armature. 10690 Base of a plaster vessel (8 x 7 x 1.5) which preserves traces of blue and red pigment. Three straight incised lines above the polished surface suggest a decoration of bands of colour. The base consists of two plaster layers, the innermost layer being thicker and slightly coarser. 10692 Large fragment of floor plaster (12x11x4), with high concentration of quartz and black gravel visible in the uppermost layer, although no obvious surface has been preserved. Within the lower plaster layer are chunks of uncalcined lime, small fragments of painted plaster, and small pebbles, similar to material from the NW Building (43.2). 10693 2 fragments of high quality plaster from the edge of an object, probably a straight-sided table/hearth (plate 35 d). These fragments curve downwards, and a well preserved paint layer, above a fine white intonaco layer, shows bands of yellow and black on one surface, and blue and red on the other. The plaster was applied in a single fine layer with very few inclusions, around an armature (probably of mud brick). ROOM 7 Although quite a large amount of plaster was found throughout Room 7, especially in Context yb.2, the disparate nature of the material hinders conclusions regarding the decoration of the space, in any of its phases of use. Of particular interest are two pieces of curved pink plaster with red paint layer, of considerable size (10715. 32 x 16 x 1-3; 30 x 15 x 1-4 cm). While this plaster is of the commonly occurring pink lime and earth plaster, it is conspicuous by its size, good state of preservation, and by the almost complete absence of floor or wall plaster of this type from room 7. Context ja. 1 10699 Fragment with imitation stone decoration (colour plate I f. This fragment certainly belongs to the same scheme as 10718 (from 8.6, colour plate I g) and probably the four smaller fragments 10728 (from Context 8.4). The thin painted edge seen on both 10699 anc' 10718 is evidence that this plaster was applied either around an architectural frame, or around an armature to create an object such as a table or bench. That this is one of the few examples of decorated plaster suggests it was from an object of some value, or appeared in a prominent place architecturally. The Context ja. 2 10700 Small fragment with light grey-blue paint layer (probably carbon black in lime). Above this, at one end of the surface, is an additional red painted plaster layer. Tool Context ja.3 10715 Two large fragments of red painted plaster. This plaster is of the type typically associated with floors in this building — pink plaster with small inclusions of clay-rich earth and calcium carbonate. Across the width of the plaster, one edge curves upwards, possibly applied against a wall, while the other edge has a more gentle downwards curve. Below the plaster was a thick layer of earth containing large Context jb. 2 10701 Polished 'wedge-shaped' fragment of fine lime plaster with flat edge. Impressions on the reverse indicate that this was applied above a timber support. Interestingly, this fragment displays a plaster join on the flat edge, (an overlap showing the sequence of plaster application) rarely seen in plaster from Block M. 10702 4 fragments with clear evidence of re-decoration. Beneath the uppermost layer of white lime plaster with highly polished surface has a thin light yellow background with overlying pink-red and orange-red wavy lines. These lines are slightly incised, probably from pressure of the paintbrush on wet plaster, although the effect may have been intentional. No intonaco layer was applied, rather the pigments were applied directly onto a 3 mm thick layer of pink coloured lime plaster, which was applied above a thicker layer of the same consistency. The plaster has the same constituents, durability, and hue as the typical pink floor plaster from this building. marks from smoothing the plaster are visible beneath the paint layer. pieces of stone and fragments of painted plaster. The profile and the heavy mud and stone support indicate that this plaster was originally applied to a horizontal surface, possibly within a niche. The fact that there is very little pink plaster from Room 7, and that a paint layer was applied, suggests that the architectural feature on which this plaster was applied may have had some significance. unpainted, polished finish (1-3 mm thickness), is an earlier layer with fine white intonaco and red paint layer. These fragments probably had a mud brick support. 10703 Corner fragment with two worked perpendicular surfaces, traces of red pigment on one and blue pigment on the other. This fine plaster has small inclusions of silt/ sand, and was applied with care, probably around an architectural frame.</page><page sequence="331">3°2 PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN ROOM 8 Contexts 8.1-4 Plaster preserved in one corner of room 8 is of the fine, thin, highly polished type frequently found in association with the coarse pink floor plaster (see Context 8.5 below). In this case, however, it appears to be connected to the schist paved floor. During excavation, two bands of a dark pigment, possibly black or dark blue, were noted near the base of the wall. Context 8.4 yielded a larger amount of typical floor plaster with pink hue, almost certainly from later contexts (Contexts 8.5-6). 10728 4 fragments (also from Context 8.4) are probably part of the same scheme seen on fragments 10718 and 10699. One has thick stripes of orange-red pigment above a pink background; one has straight orange stripes above a yellow background; one has traces of red and yellow; and one has orange and red stripes. All four fragments have a fine pink coloured intonaco layer above two plaster layers of plaster, also with a pink hue. The plaster has very fine silt/sand/earth inclusions and is quite friable. Contexts 8.5-8.6 A very large amount of plaster was found throughout these contexts. Three distinct types of pink plaster have been categorised (see below, and plate 35 c). It is unclear whether the three types represent different phases of decoration or, more likely, a difference between function — possibly the thicker, more durable type A was floor plaster, while type B was applied on the walls. While this material may have been deposited, the quantity and orientation of the plaster suggests collapse from an upper storey. In addition to the three types of pink coloured plaster, approximately 85 fragments (3-4 cm length) of a fine white plaster with high polished finish were also found. This plaster is usually applied in 2 thin layers, and fragments are flat on reverse. This appears to be very similar to the plaster found in situ in the earlier contexts, and may be from the same walls, or from an upper storey. 10725 Type A is found most abundantly (c. 485 fragments from Contexts 8.5-6). This plaster does not have a discrete paint layer, although the thick orange-red intonaco layer, when polished, creates a deep matt red finish. Fragments of this type are typically quite large and durable, with 2-3 plaster layers, and flat on the reverse. Uncalcined calcium carbonate inclusions are bigger than in types B and C (plate 35 c). 10761 Type B is found less frequently (c. 25 fragments). A well-polished, discrete red (iron oxide) paint layer is applied directly onto a thin layer of orange-pink plaster, with a higher concentration of earth inclusions than seen elsewhere. These fragments tend to be very thin and friable, and uneven on the reverse (plate 35 c). 10726 Examples of Type C are even fewer, just 11 fragments were found in these contexts. This plaster survives in larger, less deteriorated fragments. Inclusions of lime and sand are visible in the well-polished surfaces, and no final layer has been applied. The plaster was well mixed with an even distribution of inclusions, and was applied in 2-3 layers (plate 35 c). 10707 4 fragments, and 10708: 1 fragment, from a plaster vessel or circular table. This plaster was applied in two discrete layers and contains inclusions of silt/sand and finely chopped organic material. Traces of a thin, polished plaster layer remain on two fragments. The plaster curves gently downwards at one edge, as though around a rim or frame. 10710 Fragment with particularly thick white lime plaster, probably with a structural function, such as floor interstices or additional support for a frame. 10713 Modified earth plaster applied in two layers. Surface appears polished as though final, exposed layer. The mottled black finish may be pigment, or the result of burning. 10718 As described above, this fragment belongs to the same scheme as 10699 and 10728. The thin, worked edge has a good quality red paint layer, while the larger smooth surface has orange and pink wavy lines above a pale matt yellow background (colour plate I g). The plaster was applied in three layers of even thickness, and small inclusions of earth give a pink hue. The fragment is flat on the reverse, with traces of earth, possibly from earthen armature. 10724 Probably belongs to the same scheme as 10718 etc., although the deteriorated condition hinders thorough examination. Wavy lines of pink pigment above a yellow background, as well as an area of red pigment are visible on the surface. A thin layer of dark orange-red plaster (1-2 mm thickness) may have served as an intonaco layer, which was applied above a single layer of pink coloured plaster. A thin powdery layer of white lime plaster is evident on the reverse. 10727 Representative of a few fragments found with a vivid yellow-green paint layer above white plaster. The pigment is finely ground and creates a solid, homogeneous layer. 10727 has a smooth edge, probably from the edge of a wall, and quite fine white plaster with few visible inclusions. Contexts 8.y, 8.8, 8.9, 8.11 A moderate amount of pink plaster, mostly type A but also some type B and C, were found in Context 8. j, and a few fragments throughout Contexts 8.8-9. 10719: Example of type of plaster seen throughout these contexts (as well as in Rooms 12, 13, and 16) with a thick layer of grey-blue plaster (quite high concentration ash or carbon black in lime) above 1-2 layers pink plaster. This almost certainly represents a phase of re-decoration, since the pink layers below are frequently well smoothed/polished. Small pieces of uncalcined calcium carbonate and dark silt/ sand are visible in both the grey and the pink layers. 10711 Assemblage of very thin, delicate fragments of painted plaster from 1-2 objects. Three fragments have right</page><page sequence="332">PLASTER FINDS FROM BLOCK M 303 angled, well-made curves as though applied around the edge of a straight-sided object, table/hearth. One surface is polished unpainted plaster, the other has a red band. Plaster is fine white lime applied in a single layer, with thin intonaco above. The other fragments found with these are particularly thin (1-2 mm thickness). The discrete homogeneous black paint layers have the appearance of the less commonly used manganese black, rather than carbon black. While these may have been from a separate object, they certainly seem too fine and well made, in comparison with the majority of the painted plaster, to be attributed to wall or construction plaster. 10706 Fragment with gentle downwards curve to surface, two distinct paint layers, red and blue, either side of the curve. Evidence of re-decoration, lower of the two thin white plaster layers preserves a red paint layer. This was possibly applied around a rounded architectural feature, such as a column. 10766 Cone-shaped leg of free-standing object, probably from an offering table (plate 35 e). Similar plaster table legs found at Kommos were found to have an inner earthen core,16 while 10766 is of solid plaster, presumably made in a mould (such as a shallow bowl or conical cup). Context 8.13 Material from this context is essentially the same as that from Contexts 8.5-6, in the same ratios. A large number of fragments of type A plaster was found (c. 450). This material tends to be preserved in thick, durable, medium-large sized fragments (average dimensions: 8x5X1 cm). A much smaller quantity of type B plaster was found (16 fragments), as well as fragments of highly polished, thin white plaster (c. 65 fragments). 10712 Vivid, thick, yellow-green paint layer applied above a fine white intonaco, 1-2 layers quite fine white lime plaster with uneven reverse. Paint layer and plaster very similar to 10727. 10716 Fragment of construction plaster (8x4x5 cm) with flat but abraded edge and thick, uneven plaster on reverse. Possibly from around a bench or shelf. 10717 Thick fragment of construction plaster (6.5 x 4 x 4 cm). This plaster is quite coarse, with a high concentration of silt, fine sand, and uncalcined calcium carbonate inclusions. The strange shape and low density of the fragment suggest this may have been ceiling material. Context 8.14 Material as seen throughout these contexts. Approximately 160 fragments of type A plaster, typically large-sized fragments. 10 fragments of type B plaster, here preserved in fairly large fragments, with good quality, polished red paint layers intact. Approximately 50 fragments of fine, well-polished white plaster. Of particular interest from this context is the occurrence of alternating layers of white and pink lime plaster; one fragment has a layer of pink plaster above layers of typical white lime plaster, 7 fragments reverse this, with a grainy white lime plaster above pink coloured layers. 10709 Fragment with yellow-green paint layer above white intonaco and 2 layers fine lime plaster. Traces of a discrete orange paint layer overlying the yellow remain. Context 8.15 Approximately 30 fragments with thick layer of white lime plaster with smooth, possibly polished surfaces, applied above layers of pink plaster of equal thickness. 10762 Largest of three joining fragments (colour plate I d, shown collectively), the other two found in Context 15.2 (10753). This is a rare example of a probable figurative design from Block M. Unfortunately, considerable surface deteriora tion and loss of pigment hinders interpretation. Half of the fragment has a yellow background, with overlying straight and curving red lines. The other half has the appearance of unpainted polished plaster, although traces of yellow and red pigment, and barely discernible wavy lines are evident. Pigment was applied onto a fine white intonaco layer, above two even layers of fairly fine lime plaster. Reverse is flat with fine impressions, possibly from a stone support. 10723 Group of fragments with the same surface texture, plaster thickness and constituents. Flat edges on several fragments suggest this was a plastered object, bench or shelf. Surfaces very powdery and deteriorated, but traces vivid orange and yellow pigment still visible on some fragments. 10722 Thick single layer of lime plaster with thick intonaco layer, two bands of grey blue (possibly carbon black in lime matrix) separated by band of deep red. Surface left slightly unfinished, with visible tool-marks. Probably wall plaster. 10720 Handle of a plaster vessel, similar size, shape and plaster to the fragments found in Context 6.3 (10696). Constructed from solid layer of plaster with thin, fine uppermost layer to provide a smooth finish. Good quality, fine lime plaster with few small-sized silt/sand inclusions. 10721 Floor plaster of same type found in NW Building, with uppermost plaster layer containing small fragments of painted plaster (red, blue and black), pieces of uncalcined calcium carbonate, and small sand/gravel inclusions. Surface is polished and inclusions create 'mosaic' effect within the lime matrix. Lower plaster layer is coarser, with higher concentration of larger inclusions, slightly pink hue to plaster from inclusion of earth. 16 Kommos V, 762-5; pis. 4.33-38.</page><page sequence="333">PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN Context 8.16 A small amount of material was found in this context, mostly smaller and more deteriorated than from the other contexts, but similar plaster types. 10704 Fragment with interesting stratigraphy. Good quality, finely ground red paint layer above thin layer pink plaster, well mixed with high lime to earth ratio. This was applied above a second layer of pink coloured plaster, which was also painted red. This layer has a lower lime to earth ratio, and is less well mixed. A final white lime layer with quite a high concentration of organic fillers is evident on the reverse of the fragment (plate 35 b). ROOM 9 Context ga. 1 A well-preserved orange-pink plaster floor survives in this corner of Room 9. Context ga.2 A few fragments of pink floor material, almost certainly from Context ga. 1, were dispersed throughout this fill. The low lime to earth ratio suggests an early date for this material. These fragments have a thick earth backing, no visible paint layers, and 1-2 thin layers of pink plaster. 10739 3 fragments of coarse plaster containing high plaster layer above now deteriorated surface. Quite low concentration of finely chopped organic material (probably mass, and porous. animal hair), and few inclusions of sand and earth. No final Context ga.3 Fragments of pink plaster were found throughout this context. As this material was found above the paving slabs, it probably fell from a neighbouring room (Room 8?), or was applied against an architectural feature that no longer survives. The plaster is very similar to type A as described for Room 8, with a smooth orange-pink surface which is matt red-orange when polished/saturated, yet with no discrete paint layer evident. This plaster is well mixed, with a high lime to earth ratio and very even distribution of small size inclusions. Plaster was applied in two layers, although it is not clear whether this represents phases of decoration or the technology of constructing a thick solid floor material. Context ga.8 10780 Thin white plaster applied around a core of earth, support behind the two large pieces of curving plaster from large stones, and sherds, found above a column base. Plaster Context -ja.j (10715). The poor state of preservation of the remains on just under half of the rounded earthen core, plaster hinders examination. No fine intonaco layer remains, following the shape of the column. There does not appear and the plaster appears to have been applied in a single, to have been a wooden support at this point of the column. slightly coarse layer. A few inclusions of silt/sand and finely The construction of the mud and stone core resembles the chopped organic material are visible (#2955). ROOM IO Context 10a Besides the well-preserved plaster shelf, a relatively small amount of material, principally small, deteriorated fragments of pink plaster, comes from this context. 10767 2 large pieces of a plaster shelf (43 x 27 x 1; 41 x 27 x 1 cm). Nothing survives of a support for this plaster, and few impressions are preserved on the reverse, which is flat but not smooth. Both fragments were oriented face up when excavated. This plaster was probably applied above a mud brick support at the bottom of the closet, although it may have had a (now decomposed) timber support. The plaster appears to have been applied in a single application, and is well made with few visible inclusions. A thin band of black pigment remains along one edge. The use of plaster to provide a hygienic surface (which also deters insects) suitable for storage areas is attested throughout Bronze Age Crete, yet the application of painted decoration in such contexts is less common. ROOM 11 A very small amount of fairly deteriorated plaster was found in this context. Context 1 ib. 1 1073° This demonstrates the use of the frequently plaster, for structural purposes and/or objects. The fragment occurring pink plaster, typically applied as floor or wall has the shape of a narrow tray, with two edges curving</page><page sequence="334">PLASTER FINDS FROM BLOCK M upwards from the surface. The shape suggests this plaster was applied between two architectural features, or was possibly part of an object. Traces of red pigment are evident, and the plaster is of fairly high quality with fine, evenly distributed small silt and uncalcined calcium carbonate inclusions. ROOM 12 Context 12a. 4 10737 4 fragments of floor plaster with rounded pebble inclusions of range of sizes (up to 2 cm length) within very pure white lime matrix. No surface layers are preserved. While the inclusion of large inorganic fillers creates a hardwearing floor material, the absence of finer particle size faction makes the lime matrix fragile and prone to fracture. Context 12b.2 10739 3 fragments of floor plaster with thin smoothed uppermost layer (1-2 mm thickness) above thick layer with large inclusions of red clay-rich earth, silt/sand, and a few very fine organic inclusions. This is a durable, well-mixed plaster, particularly suitable as an exterior floor material. Context 12b.3 10762 Fragment of coarse structural plaster, possibly associated with the mud brick bench. This amorphous fragment has no apparent surface layer, possible timber impressions, a very low mass, and high concentration of organic (vegetal) inclusions. Context 12 b. 10 Quite a large amount of material was found in this context, particularly large-size fragments of the pink coloured lime plaster, with shapes suggestive of structural function or plaster objects. 10733 Large fragment (g x 6.5 x 1.2 cm) of well-mixed pink coloured plaster with acute upwards curve. The angle of the curve indicates this plaster was applied around an architectural feature, perhaps between the bench and the wall/floor from this room. A good quality, discrete red paint layer remains in some places. 10740 3 fragments possibly from the same object. One fragment of thick, but deteriorated plaster appears to be a solid plaster leg, perhaps from a small table. The plaster contains a fairly low concentration of small-sized inclusions, namely silt, and would therefore not bear much weight. Together with this fragment, and of similar plaster texture, colour and constituents, was a gently curving fragment of thick plaster, with vivid orange paint layer. The curve of this fragment also suggests an object, such as a table. Context 12b. 11 10736 Well-made fragment with high quality paint layer and plaster. This fragment curves downwards 90°, almost certainly around the edge of a delicate plastered object, probably a table. It is painted on both sides of the curve, the largest surface has black and yellow bands, the smallest (broken) surface has black, light blue and dark blue bands. The pigments were applied onto a thin white intonaco layer, above a thicker layer of fairly fine lime plaster. The reverse is powdery and deteriorated, but curves as though around an armature of wood or earth. Context 12 b. 12 10731 Fragment with two bands of vivid red separated by yellow band. Polished paint layer above thick white intonaco, which was applied above 1-2 layers fine white plaster. Probably wall plaster. 10732 2 fragments with thick plaster applied in two layers. Uppermost layer has grey-blue hue, probably from inclusion of ash within the lime matrix. Lower layer has pink hue, from inclusion of earth. One fragment is red, the other has a band of red and a thin layer of a very low concentration of black pigment within a thin lime layer. High polish finish. 10738 3 fragments similar to 10732, with pink plaster below layer of plaster with blue-grey hue. Inclusions of finely chopped organics, small pieces uncalcined calcium carbonate, and very small particles of black (probably carbon) visible in the grey-blue layer. A thick matt red paint layer was applied above this, on a thin white intonaco layer. 10741 2 small fragments with similar pigment and plaster as fragments 10699, 10728 and 10718, although the yellow and red stripes here are straight and symmetrical, not so clearly imitating stone. Pigments were applied onto an intonaco layer with pink hue. Two thicker plaster layers, one with pink hue, one white, are evident below. ROOM 13 Material from this room is predominantly thick, amorphous fragments of construction plaster. The material is particularly powdery and deteriorated, although whether this is due to the inherent susceptibility of the coarsely made plaster, or to adverse local burial conditions, is unclear. Quite a large amount of type A and B pink plaster was found, particularly in Context 13.3, mostly in a deteriorated condition and in much smaller fragments than those from Rooms 5 and 8.</page><page sequence="335">3°6 PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN Context 13.2 10743 Large fragment (9 x 7.5 x 2.5 cm) with flat, unfinished surface, thick plaster, and very irregular reverse as though around small stones or reeds. The plaster is very powdery, has extremely low mass, with few very fine inclusions of silt, pieces of red clay-rich earth and organic materials. This may have served a structural function, or may be ceiling material. 10744 Example of coarse (probably wall) plaster. No upper layer was applied above the arriccio, but the surface of the plaster was smoothed to a good finish. The plaster layer is fairly porous and contains quite a high concentration of finely chopped organic materials (vegetal) and silt/sand. 10746 10 fragments wall plaster with similar surface texture/colour, plaster type and thickness. A fine white lime layer has been applied above the arriccio, and polished to create a solid, water resistant outer surface. The lower plaster layer is thick and preserves impressions from small stones; it appears to have been applied directly onto and between the stones of a rubble wall, without a primary earthen layer. The plaster is quite fine with few visible inclusions. ROOM 14 Although this context yielded quite a large amount of material, fragments of various types of plaster seen throughout Block M were found here, mostly as individual fragments, or very small assemblages. The fragments also tend to be fairly small. This suggests that the material was deposited here from elsewhere. Examples of these characteristic types include fragments of white lime plaster with bright white, highly polished uppermost layer, and fragments with multiple layers of pink and white lime plaster. A further category of pink lime plaster may be unique to this context however, which has a thin layer of plaster, no intonaco layer, and a deep matt red paint layer in good state of preservation. 10751 Fragment of durable, well-mixed floor plaster with smoothed uppermost layer (1-2 mm thickness). Two thicker plaster layers below, the upper contains a high concentration of quite large round black pebbles, the lower layer has a grainy texture, no visible pebbles, but pieces of uncalcined calcium carbonate and red clay-rich earth. 10747 Thick durable plaster still adhering to long rounded stone, appears to be corner around architectural feature. Plaster probably applied in two layers, and surface smoothed but not polished. A few quite large sand and gravel inclusions are visible throughout the plaster. 10750 Two fragments with interesting plaster stratigraphy. The uppermost layer is pink lime plaster, above a similar layer with higher concentration of earth and organic inclusions. This second layer had a thin surface of blue-grey, presumably once an exposed polished surface. Below the second layer is a final layer of blue-grey lime plaster, the colour coming from the inclusion of a high concentration of ash/carbon within the lime matrix. These fragments show at least one, probably two cycles of re decoration. 10752 Large fragment of floor plaster of type seen throughout this context, and similar constituents to floor plasters from the SW Building. A thin upper layer, now almost completely missing, provided a smooth clean surface. Below this is a thick layer of very coarse plaster, with irregular shaped/sized stone inclusions (up to 2.5 cm length), small fragments of painted plaster, and pieces of uncalcined calcium carbonate. Very high mass, and very durable plaster. Almost certainly from external area. ROOM 15 As with Room 14, material from Room 15 is extremely deteriorated. Again, fragments of types of plaster characteristic of other contexts, or the building as a whole, occur here as individual fragments, usually of quite small dimensions. A few fragments of thick, construction plaster occur in Context 15.2, but generally the material is very small, fragmentary and almost certainly re-deposited. 10753 2 small fragments which join with 10762, found in the neighbouring Room 8, with red stripes above a vivid yellow background (colour plate I d). Both fragments were found in contexts with predominantly LM IA ceramics. Since this fragment represents one of just two examples from Block M of a figurative design on fine white plaster, and does not resemble the vast majority of the MM painted plaster, this later date seems plausible. 10754 Large fragment of construction plaster with triangular profile. This plaster was applied rapidly, deep tool-marks are visible in the long flat surface, possibly between small beams or reeds at the top of a wall. While quite fine, the plaster has a fairly high mass. 10756 Construction fragment with four almost 'fluted' edges. Possible timber impressions on longest flat surface. Plaster is similar to 10754, with quite high concentration of organic inclusions (vegetal, including small seeds), and high mass. Possibly ceiling material. 10757 Painted plaster from wall or object. A dark blue black paint layer (probably carbon black) with two overlying thin red stripes. This fragment has a straight edge, a slight upwards curve to surface, and an irregular reverse. ROOM 16 Plaster in less deteriorated condition than that found in Rooms 14 and 15, but again consists primarily of characteristic types of plaster found more abundantly elsewhere in the building. There is little difference between Contexts 16.1 and 16.2, with the exception of the small quantity of fragments from Context 16.1 with a layer of pink plaster below a layer of blue-grey lime plaster — this type of plaster is absent from Context 16.2. The blue-grey plaster, when polished, creates an attractive, colourful surface certainly intentionally exposed. This may have been replaced in the later periods due to a failure in the material, or simply a change in aesthetic appreciation.</page><page sequence="336">PLASTER FINDS FROM BLOCK M Context 16A.i 8845 Sherds containing large amount of red pigment. While this material is present on both exterior and interior surface of the sherds, a considerable build up of material on the inside suggests that pigment was intentionally placed in this vessel. Permanent storage is possible, however, the Context 16.2 10755 A unique fragment with imitation stone decoration (plate 35 a). Thick red wavy lines were painted above a particulate, light yellow background. The design is more realistic and less geometric than that seen on fragments 10699, 10728, and 10718. Three plaster layers are evident, creating quite a thick fragment. The uppermost layer is well mixed pink lime plaster, the middle layer has a much lower sherds form a hand-size, concave vessel suitable for use as a palette. The pigment closely resembles that used on the plaster in terms of hue and particle size, and traces of lime plaster on the outer surface give further support to the theory that this was used during the painting process. lime to earth ratio and is softer and not well adhered to the upper layer, the lowest layer again has a high lime to earth ratio and is well made. The uppermost layer appears to have been applied around these lower layers, however, suggesting an edge such as a bench, niche or table, rather than a build up of layers on a wall. ROOM 18 A relatively small quantity of plaster was found here, mostly individual fragments of a typical white lime plaster with smoothed or unfinished surfaces. A few fragments of an earthen render of similar hue to the pink lime plaster, but with extremely low lime to earth ratio, were found here. 1074a 2 large fragments of floor plaster with uppermost surface (c. 2 mm thickness), polished appearance probably through wear. Below this layer are 1-2 layers thick lime plaster, with evenly distributed small inclusions of sand and gravel. This is well-mixed plaster, suitable for an external space. Street B-M Unsurprisingly, material found in this external space tends to be small, deteriorated fragments of disparate types of plaster, from numerous locations in the building. Str.BM] 10758 Very fine fragment from the edge of an object, probably table. This fragment has a 90° downwards curve, and both surfaces are painted and polished. The largest surface has a red paint layer of finely ground red (earth) pigment, the other surface has a background of vivid blue (almost certainly Egyptian blue, a pigment not found frequently on material from Block M) with overlying black stripe. On the curve is a band of polished unpainted plaster. Pigments were applied onto a fine white intonaco, above a single layer of white lime plaster with a few fine organic inclusions. 10759 Fragment with band of black pigment between unpainted polished plaster and thick yellow paint layer. An incised line is visible where the black meets the polished plaster, delineating the composition. A thin white intonaco was applied above a thin single layer of white lime plaster with few visible inclusions. The flat reverse suggests this is a fragment of wall plaster. 10760 2 fragments, probably part of the same scheme as 10759. One fragment has decoration of yellow and black bands, fine lime plaster, flat reverse. The second fragment has similar plaster, with light blue and black bands. 10761 A third fragment with decoration of black and yellow bands, from the same composition. An incised line is visible between the bands on this fragment. Southwest Building Of the three buildings, the SW Building shows evidence for the finest painted plaster decoration. While the majority of the material is still of a more functional, construction type, quite a few fragments of painted wall plaster were found here. However, fragments with polychrome decoration were found in LM IA contexts, in rooms adjacent to Well 576 and the area between the SE and SW Buildings. These have delicate bands of alternating colours, frequently delineated with string-lines indicative of large scale compositions. A fairly large quantity of fragments with light blue paint layers was also found. ROOM 19 The finest example of polychrome decoration from Block M had been intentionally deposited in this area (10765; colour plate I a-b).17 This is the larger of the two figurative schemes from Block M. A fairly large number of fragments, with a few old breaks, were found. These fragments differ from the majority of the plaster not just for their painted decoration, but also in terms of the fine quality of the plaster. The context is MM IIIB. 17 PK 1991, 128, fig. 6.</page><page sequence="337">3°8 PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN In addition, a small amount of material was found in these contexts, mostly amorphous construction plaster. Several of the smaller fragments from Context 19.2 may be from an object, or from a ceiling. Context 19.3 10765: The plaster is a fine, white lime plaster (average thickness 0.6 cm) with few visible inclusions. An intricate leaf design was painted above the fine intonaco layer. From the remaining fragments it appears that leaves of two sizes were depicted, possibly the smaller designs were painted above the larger, main composition. Various shades of blue and grey were achieved by admixtures of the amphibole blue18 with carbon black and lime, while overlying paint layers of yellow earth created a vivid green hue. The leaves overlap and intertwine in a naturalistic representation of foliage. The suggestion that this is a depiction of tri-lobed sage (see Chapter 2) is supported not only by the closer resemblance to sage plants in terms of leaf colour and shape (see dried tri-lobed sage leaves collected from site, colour plate I c), but also the absence of the purple flowers which characterise the vetch plant. No evidence of the painting's support remains. Fragments from #o6g6, 0726-27, 0842. Context 19.2 10618 3 fragments with the characteristic curved forms of plaster objects, particularly plaster offering tables. This plaster contains a higher concentration of finely chopped organic inclusions (dry grass/straw) than typically found in the architectural plasters of Block M, as well as inorganic fillers of a small particle size (earth and silt). Traces of a grey-blue paint layer are visible on two of the fragments. Context 19.1 10586 4 large fragments of floor plaster. The thickness (up to 4 cm) and durability of the plaster suggest that this was the original floor surface of an external space. In contrast to other floor plasters from this building, inorganic inclusions have been selected to achieve a tough, durable plaster (a wide range of sizes, shapes and colours), rather than for aesthetic effect. ROOM 20 Quite a large quantity of disparate material was found in this context, with a lot of signs of building collapse (stacks of fragments, large amount of earth and debris). It is unclear whether this material was intentionally discarded from other locations, however a single event which caused plaster from nearby rooms to collapse into this space seems more likely. Context 20.1 10635 Fragment still adhering to a ceramic sherd onto which it collapsed. The unique vivid blue paint layer (probably a particularly pure sample of the naturally occurring amphibole blue pigment), and the thickness and consistency of the plaster indicate that this is fragment belongs with the leaf pattern fragments 10765. 10640 4 additional fragments belonging with 10765; two have an overlying yellow paint layer which creates a green effect. 10632 Plaster adhering to original stone support. The uppermost layer is missing, and remaining plaster is powdery and deteriorated. It appears to be quite thick and not well mixed. 10630 4 fragments of unpainted earth plaster with three discrete layers demonstrating at least two cycles of re plastering, have the appearance of wall, rather than floor, plaster. Since lime plaster was used abundantly throughout Block M, the use of earth plaster suggests an external space, or area of lesser architectural significance. Other painted fragments include two with a deep, high quality red paint layer, one with string-line impression (10636); two fragments with an orange-red and yellow matt paint layer (10638); two with traces of black pigment, one with a fine, delicate string-line impression (10639 with string-line, and 10631). ROOM 24 This context primarily yielded a small amount of unpainted fragments of (probably) wall plaster, and some amorphous pieces of construction plaster of indeterminate function. Context 24.1 10589 2 irregular shaped fragments with impressions of small sticks or reeds, and unworked surfaces, may have abutted an architectural feature such as a window or beam. 18 Brysbaert et al., 2006, 1098-9.</page><page sequence="338">PLASTER FINDS FROM BLOCK M ROOM 25 A few very small fragments with traces of light blue pigment were found here, together with large, coarse fragments of floor plaster. Context 25.1 10620 Floor plaster constructed similarly to that from Room 19, with a high concentration of inorganic inclusions, including a large piece of limestone up to 2 cm in length. Here, however, a finer layer of plaster (c. 2 mm thickness) was applied above, with much smaller inclusions visible on the smoothed surface, presumably for aesthetic reasons. 10621 Small light blue fragment with overlying black band and traces of red decoration. ROOM 26 Two types of plaster were found in this context in fairly large quantities: wall plaster with up to two layers of plaster (two cycles of decoration) plus a fine intonaco layer, and deteriorated paint layers with traces of blue pigment (probably naturally occurring amphibole blue); and fragments of irregular shaped plaster with flat edges, 'u' or V shaped profiles, and impressions from organic substrates (reeds?). The shapes of the fragments from this second group suggest ceiling plaster. Context 26.1 10566 Example of construction plaster, probably from the ceiling. This plaster is quite porous, with a low mass, and a few small inclusions of silt and organic materials. Impressions on one flat edge indicate a support of thin vegetal matter, probably fine reeds. 10567 Fragment with traces of yellow and blue pigment, and a well-preserved, delicate string-line impression, may have belonged to the same scheme as the other blue fragments from this context. ROOM 27 Context 2 j. i A fairly large quantity of unpainted wall plaster was found here. These fragments have two plaster layers (re-decoration) and polished surfaces. Despite the uniformity of the plaster, the fragments can be divided into two groups in terms of their present condition. It is possible that differential deterioration occurred during burial; however, since they were buried together it seems more likely that the deterioration was at least partially caused while the plaster was still in situ, possibly reflecting different positions on a wall, or different substrates. ROOM 28 Room 28 yielded a large amount of blue painted wall plaster, and several fragments preserving string lines. Fragments with string-line impressions, and a typical range of pigments, red, black, yellow and blue, are found in association with a larger quantity of blue painted fragments, both here and in Room 26. It is plausible that they formed part of the same scheme, since monochrome blue walls are not typical in Minoan architecture, whereas bands of colours demarcated prior to execution with string snapped against the wet plaster are frequently seen in Minoan painting compositions. Two types of floor plaster were also found in this context. While the former type has the appearance of a durable, external floor, the latter may have been originally from an internal space. Context 28.1 10595 Example of the most abundant type of floor plaster found here. This plaster has the same constituents and appearance as that found in Room 19, with large irregular inorganic inclusions up to, and exposed on the surface level. 10599 Example of second type of floor plaster, which has a higher concentration of small, rounded pebbles, obscured by a thick, polished surface layer of lime and sand. 10602 Fragment with blue paint layer, string-line, and flat edge where once abutted a ceiling or architectural feature. 10600 5 fragments with string-line impressions, and traces of black, red and yellow pigment (colour plate I e). 10597 4 fragments with matt yellow and pink paint layers, again with flat edges from positions at the top or base of a wall. ROOM 30 Context 30.1 The largest assemblage of blue painted fragments from the SW Building was discovered in Room 30. Under magnification the blue pigment has the characteristic appearance of the dark blue amphibole</page><page sequence="339">PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN pigment, riebeckite. It is darker and more particulate than the more vivid blue of the leaf pattern scheme (10767). This may be a result of the pigment preparation (grinding/mixing etc.), or may result from the use of different amphiboles (such as glaucophane and riebeckite). The tone and texture of the paint layer, as well as the thickness, constituents and quality of the plaster demonstrate that these were from a separate scheme of decoration to that of 10767. They have the characteristic paint layers and plaster type, however, of the fragments found deposited and re-used as inclusions to the plaster in Room 43 (NW Building). While it is clear that the fragments found re-used in Room 43 were collected from nearby rooms and/or buildings, since Room 30 appears not to have been roofed, and a lot of material was washed-in, it seems likely that this blue painted plaster was originally decorating a different room, probably in the SW Building.19 These fragments have two plaster layers, as well as a fine intonaco layer, representing a phase of re-decoration, seen throughout the plaster from this building. A few fragments from this context have examples of pigments other than blue: 10583 has an intriguing purple-pink pigment (probably from diluting red pigment with lime water prior to application); 10577 and 10585 have traces of red decoration overlying a yellow background. Several fragments with V shaped profiles and impressions from organic support materials (reeds/timber), as well as a large amount of amorphous pieces of plaster are characteristic of ceiling material. Since Room 30 appears to have been an external space, this material must have been from a neighbouring room. 10576 Example of the blue paint layer found on numerous fragments from this context. Quite a high concentration of blue-black particles within a grey-blue matrix creates an overall effect of a light blue, particulate paint layer, which is applied quite thickly above a fine white intonaco. These fragments tend to be fairly thin, and flat on the reverse. 10574 A large fragment with rounded edge maybe a section of the rim of a plastered vessel (similar to 10696 found in the SE Building), or the edge of a plastered ledge or frame. A thick layer of white lime plaster with few visible inclusions is covered with a thin fine layer. The fragment has a high mass, and is quite flat on the reverse. ROOM 3 1 Context 31.1 While quite a large amount of material was found in this context, it is mostly unpainted plaster, amorphous fragments of ceiling material, and a few fragments with traces of blue pigment. 10627 Fragment with traces of (carbon?) black pigment and a string-line impression. 10624 Fragment with yellow background with overlying curving red band. 10623 2 fragments with red bands separated from polished plaster band by string-line impressions. ROOM 32 Context 32.1 Very little plaster was found here. 10591 Small fragment with two well-preserved string line impressions, exactly 1 cm apart, separating bands of dark red (earth), polished white plaster surface, and black. Context 32.3 Three different types of floor plaster can be identified, all of which must have been deposited here from elsewhere, due to the schist paving in this room. 10605 Floor plaster similar to 10620 (Room 25), with small carefully selected pebbles visible in the surface, possibly in imitation of stone. 10610 Floor plaster resembles 10599 (Room 28), with a higher concentration of small inorganic inclusions, covered by a smooth plaster surface. 10606 and 10612 Examples of a particularly finely made floor plaster. The thick lower layer contains large pebble inclusions. This is covered with a unique layer of very small pieces of pink and blue plaster (c. 0.3 x 0.3 cm) and black gravel within a lime matrix, creating a very fine 'mosaic' effect, while maintaining a durable consistency. 10604 2 large&gt; and several smaller fragments with V shaped profiles characteristic of ceiling plaster. 19 The latest material in Context jo.i is LM IA, and from comparison with the MM II—III material from Block M, such a date is likely. The fragments from 43.2, however, were found with MM IIIB ceramics.</page><page sequence="340">PLASTER FINDS FROM BLOCK M A group of 15 blue painted fragments, one with a flat edge where abutted a floor or ceiling (10613), was also found in this context, together with two fragments with red, orange and yellow paint layers (10609 and 10611); a black painted fragment with flat edge (10607); and one light blue fragment with overlying fine black line decoration (10608). Context 32.4 10590 Fragment with unique paint layer and plaster from the other Block M material. The paint layer is thicker, and of a lighter blue pigment (possibly Egyptian blue), while ROOM 33 Context 33.1 Twelve blue painted fragments were found, with the typical dark blue paint layers found throughout the building. 10571 2 fragments with matt pink paint layers above quite fine lime plaster, one fragment with upwards curve to surface. Northwest Building Plaster found in the NW Building is almost exclusively of a type that maybe termed 'construction plaster', serving a functional rather than aesthetic role within the architecture. Large quantities of coarse plaster were discovered throughout the building, from floors, ceilings, packing, or basic unpainted walls, and the few fragments with paint layers predominantly had been collected from elsewhere in antiquity and re-used within later, coarse plaster. This is unsurprising in view of the function of certain parts of the building, such as the wine press. room 34 The material from this context resembles that from the SW Building rather than the typical NW Building material. Unfortunately, however, the most intriguing of the plaster finds occur in isolated examples, and any conclusions about where they were originally from must remain hypothetical. Also from this context are c. 20 fragments with a vivid orange paint layer, not seen elsewhere in Block M, a few with particulate, matt yellow paint layers, and a few unpainted fragments. It does not seem that these fragments have been collected for re-use, and the quantity suggests they may have been found in or near their original position (potentially decorating the collapsed shelf?). Context 34.1 10645 Fragment with red and black bands separated by thin band of polished plaster, delineated with string-lines. This fragment is very similar, in terms of the pigments used and the thickness and consistency of the plaster, to 10600 from the SW Building. 10646 Fragment with straight edge (of wall, or against ROOM 35 Quite a large amount of floor plaster was found in this context, identifiable by the high concentration of inorganic inclusions (sand, gravel and pebbles). In addition to a few fragments with light blue paint layers, and two very small fragments with an unusual, vivid purple pigment, are seven fragments of good quality wall plaster, very similar in plaster consistency, thickness, and surface texture to fragments from nearby (Contexts 41.1 and 42.3). Context 35.1 10648 5 fragments preserving impressions of reeds, commonly found in fragments of ceiling plaster.

Context 36.1 10649 One of the finest fragments from the NW highly polished rounded edge. This is a fragment from a Building, this fragment has a circular design in finely ground straight-sided plaster object, possibly the outer rim of a table, (probably carbon) black pigment on the surface, and a ROOM 37 Context 3 7.1 Just two fragments of amorphous lime plaster with silt/sand inclusions producing a grainy consistency. room 38 Context 3 8.1 Few very small fragments, some with traces of dark blue and black paint layers. room 39 Context 39.1 Of interest from this context are two fragments of a type of floor plaster that is found throughout the NW Building, with a high concentration of small, rounded pebbles in the lower layer of plaster, covered by a very pure, highly polished layer approximately 3 mm thickness. Since these fragments are found in various contexts, and never in large quantities, it is unclear from where they originally came. room 40 A relatively large quantity of coarse construction plaster was found in this room. These fragments, typically quite large, amorphous, and badly mixed, came from ceilings or were used to pack and/or stabilise objects. A few thin unpainted fragments, possibly belonging with object 10651, and one or two fragments of unpainted plaster still adhering to small stone supports (from walls or free-standing structures), were also found. Context 40.1 10763 4 amorphous fragments of a type of construction plaster not found elsewhere in Block M. This very porous Context 40.2 10651 Large fragment (19.5 x 9 x 2.4 cm) with breaks that occurred in antiquity (joins with fragments from Contexts 40.4 and 40.1). The smooth downward curves on both edges from the surface, and impressions on the reverse, show that this plaster was applied around a frame (&lt;9 cm width). This good quality plaster was applied in a single ROOM 42 Context 42.1 Quite a large quantity of a thin, brittle plaster, usually adhering to a thin layer of earthen render, was found in and around the pithos. This very distinctive plaster is also found in Context 42.2 (from within the tank), and may be assumed to be originally from the same context (lining the stone and mud brick construction). 1065a Example of plaster characteristic of this room flat but un-worked surface, and two thin layers of low quality (plate 36 a). This large fragment (15 x 9 x 1.3 cm) has a plaster with a grainy texture. Context 42.2 A large quantity of different kinds of plaster was excavated from within the plaster-lined tank.

It is too narrow to have been around the rim of the plaster-lined tank, but probably served some function within the wine manufacturing process, as effort and skill were applied to create a durable, waterproof plaster finish to a (square/rectangular shaped) object.</page><page sequence="342">PLASTER FINDS FROM BLOCK M 313 from Room 43 (where such plaster was being stored/manufactured, see below), or may have been taken from there in order to stabilise the wine making installation in this room. 10654 Fragments of floor plaster with smooth uppermost layer above layer with rounded pebble inclusions (as described above Context 39.1) were found, evidently not in their original location. 10653 Plaster appears to be from an object, as the highly polished, high quality uppermost layer curves inwards around an uneven support of coarse plaster. 10655 7 joining fragments broken in antiquity, provides one of the few examples of painted wall plaster found in the NW Building. Traces of red pigment overlie a deteriorated light blue paint-layer, and were applied on a thin, fine intonaco above two thicker plaster layers. The thickening of the plaster towards the one smooth edge shows that this fragment was from the top or base of the wall. ROOMS 43-44 These contexts yielded a large amount of material with the same constituents and texture as the 'lump of plaster' found in Context 43.2. Mixed into the coarse plaster are large fragments of painted wall plaster (usually with good quality but deteriorated blue pigment, but red and black paint-layers can also be seen), as well as large pieces of broken murex shell, and pebbles (plate 35 f). No layers are evident within the fragments, which can be up to 5 cm thickness, and very few flat surfaces are visible. In addition, the plaster has an extremely coarse and powdery texture. Since no impressions of a container are evident, it is possible that this plaster was an intentionally constructed solid structure, possibly related to the stairway. Alternatively, since it appears to have been previously prepared for application (with the inclusion of inorganic fillers), it may have been stored in water in an airtight container for a short period of time, ready for use,20 or may simply have been excess plaster from application on a nearby wall or floor, discarded here. Quite a number of painted fragments were found throughout these contexts, often of a size which would not customarily be used as filling materials. These fragments have certainly been collected from elsewhere (although not obviously from within Block M). Whether the fragments were included as large-scale fillers, or were intended to be crushed, the re-use of old plaster demonstrates an awareness of how to improve the physical properties of plaster, as well as an ability to utilise all available materials for construction.21 It also shows that blue painted walls occurred during or prior to MM III (when the coarse plaster was formed). Context 43.1 10657 Example of the plaster described above, with coarse, powdery texture and inclusions of small fragments of painted wall plaster (plate 35 f). Context 43.2 10658 Fragment of the same coarse powdery plaster seen throughout this context, with 10 carefully selected smooth black pebbles placed into a lime plaster matrix on the surface, creating a 'mosaic' appearance. This intriguing surface preparation certainly indicates that this fragment was applied, rather than forming accidentally, however this is the only example of any clear surface treatment on this type of plaster. room 45 Just a few fragments, mainly unpainted construction plaster. Context 45.3 10659 Group of joining fragments that appear to be part of an object. This thick plaster curves sharply upwards at one end, and appears to have been applied in a single layer. The plaster is coarse and friable, very uneven on the reverse, and not of very high quality. A particulate blue-black layer underlies a thin matt pink-yellow pigment at one end. Found together with these fragments was plaster of a very similar thickness and consistency, also curving, but with no flat surface. While it is possible that these fragments were from the top of a wall, it is more likely that they formed part of a bench or table. 10661 Yellow painted plaster fragment found oriented face-down within a sherd. As also seen in Context 20.1 (10635), ^e paint layer on this fragment demonstrates that the plaster adhered to the ceramic (loosely) during burial. 20 For possible evidence for the temporary storage of lime from Knossos and Kato Zakros see Shaw (Shaw 2009, 144-5). 21 Re-used plaster fragments were also found at Kommos (.Kommos V, 208-10), as inclusions within certain floor plasters from LM I onwards.</page><page sequence="343">3J4 PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN ROOM 46 A fairly small assemblage of plaster was found in Room 46. This material is mainly unpainted wall plaster, coarse amorphous construction plaster, and plaster of the characteristic type found more abundantly in Room 43. Context 46.2 10663 and 10664 2 large fragments of plaster with inclusions of wall plaster fragments and large pieces of shell may be from the 'lump' of plaster from Room 43. This plaster appears to have been applied however, especially 10664 which has a mud brick support. Both fragments have a harder, more compact surface than seen on the Room 43 material. The thickness and durability of this plaster would be appropriate for an external floor material. ROOM 48 Context 48.1 Floor plaster was found in situ in this context. This plaster is similar to that described below (Room 50). Fragments show 2 plaster layers, possibly representing phases of re-decoration. Traces of red pigment are visible on some of the fragments, although this has almost completely flaked/worn off. This is unsurprising since the red (earth) pigment is extremely water soluble in its present condition, and may never have been very well adhered to the plaster. 10665 Example of floor plaster type from this context. of red clay-rich earth, and large chunks of uncalcined The plaster has a characteristic pink hue, from the addition calcium carbonate. Context 48.2 Fragments found in the LM IA pit were generally construction plaster, with impressions of reeds, flat edges and curved surfaces. 10666 2 long thin fragments with 3 flat edges and a light blue paint layer on one surface probably decorated an architectural feature, door/window/shelf etc. 10667 Fragment with deep impressions from reeds of various thicknesses. While reed impressions usually indicate ceiling plaster, the unusual curvature of this fragment suggests the plaster was applied on a rounded surface, possibly an armature of reeds. ROOM 49 Context 49. i A few fragments of lime-earth (pink coloured) floor plaster (type D as described below Context 50.1) were found here. Context 49.2 A very small quantity of plaster was found in this context. 10669 Thick curved fragment from the rim of plaster table, with red and blue decoration overlying a matt pink background. Not much of the paint layer survives, but the plaster is good quality, and applied skilfully in one layer (plus a fine intonaco) with a smooth curve. Impressions in the earth adhering to the reverse suggest an earthen armature was used. 10668 Group of joining fragments possibly associated with the table. These fragments consist of thick but light powdery plaster, with traces of light blue and vivid yellow orange pigment. Fragments of this type are found throughout the NW Building, however this is the only one of significant size (8 x 6.5 x 2 cm). ROOM 50 Two distinct types of plaster can be distinguished from the large amount of material from Room 50 (mostly from Context 50.2). Context 50.2 10670 Example of the two types of pink plaster. Type D is thin, with two discrete layers of plaster of even thickness. Since the lower layer was not painted, this probably represents a feature of application methodology rather than evidence of re-decoration. A highly pigmented intonaco layer (less than 1 mm thickness) darkens the hue of the overlying red paint layer. The shiny quality of the paint layer may have been achieved through polishing and/or through wear. Type E survives in larger, thicker fragments and appears to be more durable. The plaster has a lighter pink hue due to</page><page sequence="344">PLASTER FINDS FROM BLOCK M a higher lime content, and more thorough preparation (mixing). Two plaster layers can be seen on some of the type B fragments, the upper layer being thinner than the lower, and no intonaco layer has been applied. Traces of a more intense orange-red colour are visible on some of the fragments. This does not seem like a discrete paint layer, but rather a result of polishing the surface. It is unclear whether these two types represent different periods, or different areas of decoration (wall and floor, for example). ROOM 54 Context 54.2 Fragments of a floor plaster similar to that found in the SW Building were probably discarded in this area. The plaster has a finer upper layer containing murex shells and chunks of a lime-rich material, which would have been visible in the polished surface, above a lower coarser layer with range of inclusions for durability. room 64 Small stones with well-adhered plaster, presumably from a rubble wall, were found in Contexts 64.2 64.4. Similar material (in terms of plaster surface, thickness, constituents, and size and shape of stone) was also found in the SE Building. A few fragments of amorphous construction plaster, floor plaster, and unpainted wall material were also found here. Context 64.2 10673 2 fragments of plaster adhering to stone supports. The absence of an intermediate earth plaster is noteworthy, indicating that a fairly flat, continuous surface was created with small-scale stones, especially since the plaster is quite thin and even. The plaster is well made and durable, although evidently served a functional rather than aesthetic role since the surfaces are unfinished, with visible tool-marks from the plaster application. 10672 Fragment with inward right-angled curve, demonstrates that this plaster was applied around a frame (door/window/bench), and exemplifies the use of the pink plaster in such 'architectural' contexts (i.e. not just as floor material). Context 64.3 10674 Thick layer of modified earth plaster with a particulate matt green pigment (presumably applied within a lime matrix). This is a unique example of painted earth plaster from Block M. The pigment is also unusual; it appears to be green earth, a pigment very rarely used in Bronze Age wall painting in Crete. Context 64.4 10676 Construction plaster with two finished edges (probably from between two pieces of timber or stone), and a blue paint layer with overlying traces of yellow pigment. The plaster was applied in 2 layers plus a thin fine intonaco, and was evidently of high quality. 10677 Fragment of good quality floor plaster with a highly polished surface containing pieces of crushed murex shell and limestone, above a thicker coarser layer of plaster.</page><page sequence="345">Chapter 10 Synthesis: Block M and Proto- and Neopalatial Crete ARCHITECTURE, BUILDING HISTORY AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT The Block M evidence allows us to see some signs of early occupation of the site prior to any concerted urban development. Although the site of Roussolakkos was already occupied from EM IIA, in Block M the earliest evidence we find comes from EM IIB. These levels are, however, rather minimal, consisting of handfuls of sherds close to bedrock, often at c. 10.30-10.40-. It may be that at some later stage, perhaps in MM II, this part of the settlement was terraced down to this level in preparation for substantial construction. Certainly this would partly explain the relative lack of EM III, MM IA and MM IB remains across Block M, at least as excavated up to now. EM III, for example, is present in just one context, in Room 64, which lies to the far ne of the Block, just inside the N fagade. N of this fagade, on the other side of the alley running between Block M and Building 5, is Building 7, where Prepalatial levels are much better preserved.1 Here EM III levels do exist, as do EM IIB and MM I. They are also known from other parts of Roussolakkos, as outlined at the beginning of Chapter 4. We should not, therefore, take the paucity of EM III in Block M as a sign of some kind of recession or abandonment. MM IA is similarly poorly represented in Block M, for the reasons suggested above in relation to EM III. We find just two pockets of MM IA material in Rooms 13 and 45. Likewise for the MM IB period: it is represented by just one small area in Room 50. As with EM III, this should not be interpreted in terms of a lack of activity at Roussolakkos in general, as the MM IA floor deposit in Block X Room 1 and the accumulated MM IB material in Trench H3 indicate the contrary.2 It is again a matter of subsequent activity in Block M clearing earlier levels. The earliest evidence for substantial activity in the area comes from the MM IIA period. Or rather, the pottery can be dated to MM IIA, while the activity might actually belong in early MM IIB. This is because all the MM IIA pottery comes from huge fill deposits, exclusively from the Southeast Building, particularly its eastern part. There are 16 contexts in all, from Rooms 1, 9a and b, 10a, 12, 13 and 18. These contexts correspond in spatial terms fairly closely to the distribution of the contexts with EM IIB, found in Rooms 1, 4, 9a, 11a, 12b and Street B-M. It thus appears that a surface was levelled down to about 10.30-10.40T, leaving just bedrock and some patchy EM IIB material, and to level the area out a huge building fill was laid down prior to construction. That this is concentrated in the E part of the Southeast Building must be attributable to the nature of the slope and the bedrock. The latest pottery in this huge fill can be dated to MM IIA, which provides a terminus post quem for the building operation. Given that all this pottery probably came from a major destruction episode of some kind at the end of the MM IIA period, it seems logical to suggest that the building event took place in what one might call 'early MM IIB', i.e. after this MM IIA destruction. Given the quality and diversity of the pottery, and other small finds, one must imagine during the MM IIA period an impressive building somewhere close by; traces of such a building have, however, eluded us thus far.3 Thus it seems that the building in the plan as we see it today might have been first devised in MM IIB; that is to say, during the latter part of the Protopalatial period. In Chapter 4 we suggested that evidence from the 1902-06 excavations, though difficult to interpret, might indicate comparable activity in this period elsewhere at Roussolakkos, for example seen in the realignment of the street next to Block X. A parallel of sorts might also be found at Kommos, where Building AA appears to have been constructed in early MM IIB, with colonnades and a pebbled court, to be replaced in MM III by Building T.4 What we actually see in Block M is the first use of ashlar blocks for facades (e.g. the E one), the installation of finely-built stone-lined drains, and each of these going hand-in-hand with planned streets, of a scale at Palaikastro that compares well with any other site on the island. However, dating all of these features to MM IIB is not entirely straightforward; we do not have a destruction horizon in MM IIB that shows the building in use. This is interesting in itself, when 1 See Knappett 2007. 2 PK VIII154-62, and 168-79 respectively. 3 We should not be surprised to see major buildings in East Crete in MM IIA, given that the palace at nearby Petras was first constructed in this period. See Tsipopoulou 1999; 2002. 4 Kommos V. 3J7</page><page sequence="346">318 PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN compared to the major destructions suffered by so many Cretan sites at the end of MM IIB, not least the palatial sites of Knossos, Phaistos and Malia, as well as Monastiraki, Myrtos Pyrgos, and others. Most of the MM IIB contexts, certainly in the Southeast Building, are associated with construction rather than destruction. In Room 10a we see a foundation deposit with an archetypal MM IIB pot; in Rooms 10b and 12 the contexts are associated with the construction (and use) of drains; and in Room 16a a series of whole pots, one seemingly full of red pigment perhaps used for red plaster, may conceivably be builders' debris. We also have probable MM IIB (or perhaps IIIA) contexts in Main Street and Street B-M. Finally, in the NW Building the contexts in Rooms 45, 48 and 52 are more what one might expect of pockets of destruction material, although there is no primary deposit. We may argue, therefore, that Roussolakkos is already becoming 'urban' in MM IIB, and that this is consolidated in MM IIIA. This kind of continuity across what is commonly seen as a divide between Proto- and Neopalatial periods is very striking, and certainly contrasts with the fate of many other East Cretan sites.5 It looks very much as if Block M, rather than suffering a destruction at the end of MM IIB, simply continues in existence, albeit with some architectural modifications. Some of these modifications may well have occurred early in the MM IIIA period. We do, after all, see foundation deposits assignable to MM IIIA in Rooms 4 and 5, the earliest deposits in Rooms 6, 7 and 8 are MM IIIA,6 and the earliest cobbled surface in Street B-M clearly has MM IIIA pottery lying on it. Likewise the wine press (Room 42) in the NW Building may have been installed in MM IIIA (though using an MM II pithos). It is tempting to see at the same time the addition of the polythyron (Room 3) in the SE Building. It is, however, hard to be certain about this dating, as the main rooms of this arrangement, namely 3, ga and gb, are basically just sandwiched between MM IIA fill beneath and LM IA wash above. Being paved areas they do not preserve any in situ evidence for their use during MM III. While, as noted in Chapter 2, this arrangement is not a canonical Minoan Hall (lacking a lightwell and forehall), the rectangular central court with stoa (including cut stone column bases), polythyron (with stone doorjamb bases) and reception room are features one would associate with the palace centres of central Crete and be among the earliest examples of such 'palatial' architectural features.7 Given this, it might be hard to argue for an MM IIB date for the arrangement of court/stoa/reception room separated by a polythyron-, but considering that there are early versions of Minoan Halls at Malia (the Crypte Hypostyle from MM I—II and Quartier Mu in MM IIB),8 we should not, as Shaw suggests, be surprised to find more early examples. And at Knossos, while we do not see Minoan Halls as such as early as MM II, there are hints of pier-and-door partitions from early levels in the Domestic Quarter that could conceivably belong to MM II antecedents of the Hall of the Double Axes.9 So while new finds may in the future change this picture, the balance of evidence suggests that the polythyron was put in place in MM IIIA; this already makes them among the earliest gamma- or tau-shaped stone jamb bases known.10 This early appearance of central Cretan elite architectural styles, coupled with the mosaiko paved floor in Room 8, the painted plaster imitating marble veining11 and possible lustral basins in Rooms 7 or 8, indicate some kind of close political connection with the centre of the island. Given that this architecture is unparalleled thus far at Palaikastro such connections must not have been chosen or enjoyed by all resident groups there; and given the relatively short-lived nature of the Southeast Building, we may assume that these connections were not particularly beneficial (or welcome) over the longer term. Block M seems to have suffered some kind of destruction episode at the end of MM IIIA, judging from the number of complete or almost complete pots on floors across the building such as in the semi basement Rooms 4-8. However, this just provides an impetus to new construction, and the Block sees remodelling in MM IIIB and continued occupation. This period certainly seems to be one of growth for the settlement as a whole, with MM IIIB deposits found in many of the town blocks and beyond.12 The destruction, though, is part of the reason why this period is so well attested. This is certainly the case for Rooms 10a and 45, closets full of pottery, especially drinking vessels, simply left in place after the seismic event.13 Large quantities of MM IIIB pottery also in the Southeast Building come from Rooms 6, 8, 11a, 14 and 16. In the NW Building the wine press goes out of use, with in situ pottery 5 For 'recessions' at Myrtos Pyrgos, Pseira, Gournia, Petras and Zakros, see papers in Macdonald and Knappett forthcoming. That this may be due to their political affiliation (i.e. not affiliated with Knossos), see Knappett 2011. 6 Rooms 4-8 may only have been added in MM IIIA, see Chapter 2, p. 15.

Although from a violent destruction, this material testifies to the full and extensive occupation of Block M during the MM IIIB period. Equally, this material marks the end of the full habitation of the area: following this destruction, there is only evidence for a partial reuse of parts of the Block, particularly in the Southwest Building, but also in Rooms 6, 7, 8 and 15 of the Southeast. The only significant new construction, in the Southwest Building, is focused on Rooms 29-32, a scavenged external space between two buildings. And while on occasion the LM IA contexts do include some 'fine' pottery, such as the double strainer vase 736 from Room 6, in most instances they consist of conical cups, cooking pots and baking plates, and represent what might be loosely termed 'squatter' occupation. Indeed, one of the pits in Room 12 seems to have been dug as a baking pit, as it was found filled with baking plate fragments. In the midst of this partial occupation, while the Southeast Building is being dismantled, the Theran eruptions strikes, scattering a thick layer of tephra over the settlement; while in most other buildings subsequent reoccupation in LM IB involved the clearing away of the ash-fall, the partial character of the occupation in Block M meant that this ash lay uncleared. In many instances it seems to have been washed in, as in Main Street and Street B-M, and indeed in the large pit in Room 12 found full of tephra up to a depth of 20 cm, as part of a flooding event shortly after the eruption. Further indication that these ash deposits were waterborne is the fact that intermingled within them is LM IA pottery. This LM IA wash of ash and pottery is found across many parts of the Block, also in the NW Building in Rooms 48-50 and 53, apparently funnelled towards a probable exit through Room 53 into the Alley 5-M. This cataclysmic event really did put paid to the occupation of Block M, with even partial 'squatter' habitation abandoned. The Block is walled off and given over to other non-residential functions, with the installation in early LM IB of two deep wells.14 Whether left empty or used for animals, this is an odd choice for a 'prime' plot in the middle of town, when substantial LM IB occupation is all around. The reason we can perhaps trace all the way back to MM IIIA, when the occupants decided to express their affiliation to the emerging power that was Knossos by constructing the Southeast Building, with its central court and reception room, and presumably performing certain activities here that would align them with north-central Crete both culturally and politically. While this may have served the residents well through the 100 years or so of the MM III period (c. 1700-1600 bc), it seems not to have lasted any longer than this. The strongly regional trajectory taken by Palaikastro in LM IB is well known, and can be seen continuing into LM III; what the current evidence indicates is that the influence of Knossos may already have become unwelcome before LM IB, even in LM IA. FUNCTION What are we able to conclude about the function of the different areas within Block M? They are not homogenous. Even the Northwest and Southeast Buildings, which overlap chronologically, show very different patterns of use. The Northwest Building devotes the bulk of the ground floor to winemaking and kitchen activities, while the Southeast Building is dominated by a large central court surrounded by sunken rooms. The only feature they share are pantries or closets full of drinking vessels. Although both had upper stories, that of the Southeast Building was restricted to the w portion by the presence of the court. Could these two structures have served a singular entity, be it a large family or clan group, with the Northwest Building being residential and the Southeast ceremonial? One very striking feature is the general lack of storage wares across the Block for any of the periods in question. The best 'assemblage' of storage wares is connected with the wine press in the NW Building, in use throughout MM III, but these are only what would be needed for the winemaking activities. Architecturally, the Southwest Building looks like a storage facility, but no storage vessels were found, and we do not know its function or even if it existed during the major phase of occupation in the Block (MM III). So while it may just be an accident of preservation that we have no sign of storage, it seems more likely that it must reflect something real about the use of the building. A second pattern to highlight is the profusion of handleless cups, particularly in the MM IIIA and IIIB phases. These rapidly-made forms, principally ledge-rim bowls and conical cups, are found very often stored together in stacks, as in Room 11a for example. They seem to be supplies for regular 'feasting' events, or what one might more modestly imagine as regular occasions of token hospitality, perhaps welcoming visitors.15 These closets or cupboards full of pottery are found close to entrances and open paved areas, as is the case with Rooms 10a, 11a and 45. These closets do contain some 14 Published in PK Wells. 15 Rupp and Tsipopoulou 1999.</page><page sequence="348">320 PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN decorated drinking vessels, such as straight-sided cups with simple white-on-dark bands but tend not to include any very finely decorated wares, which are sporadically distributed across the building, with no discernible logic or pattern. The closets also contain some pouring vessels and cooking pots, suggesting a kind of kit for providing hospitality or 'feasts'. Cooking pots are also found in the LM IA 'squatter' occupation of the building, often in conjunction with baking plates and conical cups. As has been mentioned in Chapter 6, this evidence, and the way it is distributed across the buildings, points to the partial occupation of the block during LM IA. Another surprising trait is the almost total absence of pedestalled lamps and the very meagre quantities of 'industrial' wares such as fireboxes for any of the periods of occupation. While there are a few hand-lamps found in the Block, there is a particular lack of wares for lighting or industrial functions. While in general Block M does not furnish any indication of craft activity, there is some intriguing evidence from Room 11 a, raising the question of pottery manufacture and its location and character. The extensive MM IIIB pottery deposit from this room included a number of unfired or partially fired conical cups and ledge-rim bowls, in many cases stacked within fired examples of the same type. These unfired vessels would not survive the normal washing and conservation processes, being very fragile. Could these possibly represent a batch of vessels stacked ready for firing? How then can one explain the fact that many of the vessels are clearly perfectly well fired already? It seems more likely that these were only very partially fired pots that somehow were deemed sufficient for one-off use. Nonetheless, this does at least raise the question of where production took place. It seems unlikely that it occurred anywhere close to Room 11 a, which is after all near a probable entrance to the building near one of the main crossroads of town, between Main Street and Street B-M. We know very little of production organisation and workshop location in the Middle Minoan period, either at Palaikastro or other sites; the Quartier Mu complex at Malia, dating to MM IIB, is the only case where a whole series of craft workshops has actually been excavated.16 One has to presume that the lack of evidence is because workshops were generally located on the edges of settlements, perhaps for easier access to supplies of clay, water and wood. As for the organisation of production, one has to suppose that a settlement the size of Palaikastro must have been supplied by a number of local workshops, perhaps specialising to some extent in different wares or types. That the potter's wheel is in use from MM IB onwards, and gradually used for larger and larger vessels, until nearly all pots are used with this technique by LM IA, might also be taken as a strong indication that potters at Palaikastro were highly skilled full-time artisans.17 More detailed observations on the character of production require detailed analysis of fabrics, forms, wares and styles in order to gain as full an understanding as possible of the technological choices being made. The absence of petrographic analysis of pottery fabrics at Palaikastro places limitations for the time being on how much we can say. Yet we may observe that the semi-fine orange fabrics used for the mass-produced handleless cups in MM III do appear to be reasonably standardised. The fabrics also seem to change from MM II to MM III, with the earlier fabrics being a little finer and more yellow-buff; this may indicate a shift in the exploitation in clay resources, though again this should await fuller fabric analysis involving petrography and the sampling of local clays. REGIONAL CONNECTIONS The pottery evidence can also be used as an indicator of regional connections, be they economic, cultural and/or political. We can examine the degree to which pottery styles in different periods correlate with those of neighbouring sites and those further afield; are there distinctive East Cretan styles throughout the periods under consideration, or is there greater ceramic regionalism in MM II, for example? While there are certainly peculiarities in the repertoire, such as the penchant for interior appliques in MM II, pointing to local creativity in pottery production and use, Palaikastro definitely participates in the island-wide ebb and flow of ceramic trends, such as the preference for white-on dark in MM II, the shift to dark-on-light through the course of MM III and into LM IA; the proclivity for carinated, straight-sided and hemispherical cups in MM II; the dramatic appearance in MM IIIA of plain cups and bowls, a trend that reaches fuller fruition through the course of MM IIIB and into LM IA. One might also highlight the evidence for ceramic imports, surprisingly slight given the coastal location of Palaikastro and its potentially strategic location — only in MM II do we see a consistently imported ceramic fabric, from the Mirabello bay area, a pattern observed elsewhere in this period, such as at Malia and Myrtos Pyrgos. Imports from central Crete are harder to be confident about, given that they seem to occur in fine buff fabrics, which are very similar at many sites on the island; 16 Poursat 1996. 17 See Knappett 1999; Rnappett 2004.</page><page sequence="349">SYNTHESIS: BLOCK M AND PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL CRETE 321 however, even the most generous estimate would only be able to include a rather limited number of imports from Knossos and its immediate satellites. There are perhaps a handful of possible Knossian imports in MM II, in the form of eggshell ware; and in MM III and LM IA some fine decorated wares are suggestive but certainly not conclusive. As for off-island imports, these are almost completely absent from Block M (unguent flask 639 as very rare possible exception); this does contrast quite strongly with the picture from Knossos, particularly for MM III, but is perhaps in line with the picture at most other Cretan sites. OVERVIEW: REGIONAL SETTLEMENT DYNAMICS AND ISLAND GEOPOLITICS As we have seen, the material evidence, in large part consisting of the pottery and the architecture, allows us to trace the changing role of Palaikastro in the context of its wider region. Through each of the main periods represented here, from MM IIA to LM IA, spanning some three centuries (c. 1850 1525 bc), Palaikastro finds itself caught up in the broader cultural and political dynamics affecting the whole island, seeking to establish itself in relation to its neighbours. The inhabitants, or at least those of Block M, seem to have been cognisant of the need to align themselves with the rising power of Knossos towards the end of the Protopalatial period and, compared to other settlements in East Crete, their decision (assuming it was theirs to make) seems to have paid off in the short to medium term. However, pursuing geopolitical strategies of this kind requires some flexibility as circumstances shift; and it seems that following the seismic destruction of Block M at the end of MM IIIB this Knossian connection may have gone stale or indeed been definitively rejected, as the Minoan Hall was not resurrected. Although the collapse of the Knossos-centred palatial system was more than one hundred years off, perhaps some seeds of unrest or doubt were already sown. Certainly after the Theran eruption at the end of LM IA, Palaikastro shows some very strong local responses that indicate a degree of independence perhaps not seen since the early Protopalatial period. What the Block M evidence also tells us is that this independent current may already have begun in LM IA. Contrary to the common assumption that LM IA is the period of maximum Knossian influence, with MM III a rather shadowy precursor, it may be argued that it is the MM III period that sees the greatest Knossian expansionism, as seen recently at other sites both on and off island, such as Galatas and Akrotiri.18 This raises the fascinating question as to the possible existence of a palatial building,19 and more specifically its potential date: if the palace at Zakros is not built until LM IB,20 and if we see such Knossian influence in Block M during MM III, might it be that a palace at Palaikastro was installed in MM III, only surviving until LM IA? If a palace is shown to exist, its period of use will be of particular interest. It would certainly serve to place the changing patterns of occupation in Block M in their wider urban context. 18 Rethemiotakis 2002; Knappett and Nikolakopoulou 2008.

Bichler, K. Wartmann, J. H. Sterba, G. Steinhauser The Palaikastro sample material has been supplied by Carl Knappett (University of Toronto, Canada) and was investigated in the framework of the SCIEM2000 research programme of the Austrian Science Fund and the Austrian Academy of Sciences. The aim of the study was to check the samples for the presence of tephra (volcanic ash particles, produced during an explosive eruption and deposited from the eruption cloud) and to identify the source of these particles by comparison of their composition to the data sets ('chemical fingerprints') compiled in earlier studies.1 Of the 28 samples received, nine were found to contain tephra in quantities suitable for separation and analysis. A list of these samples is given in table A. 1. Table A.i. Palaikastro tephra-bearing sediment samples and identification results.

The latter range from a few micrometers to several mm in diameter and have a nearly holohyaline (glassy) matrix with few microscopic crystalline inclusions. For a reliable identification of the source volcano by the chemical composition of these particles ('chemical fingerprinting') it is necessary to extract these volcanic particles. The following procedures were applied to stepwise remove all non-volcanic components to yield a more or less pure tephra sample for analysis. In a first step, all samples were decarbonatised by immersion in diluted nitric acid and agitation by ultrasound. After washing with distilled water, a separation of clay minerals was applied. To prevent coagulation of the clay minerals, the samples were suspended in a solution of sodium polyphosphate (2%) and particles &lt;2 micrometers were removed by repeated sedimentation and decanting after suitable time intervals. Another washing procedure in distilled water followed to remove the polyphosphate. In five cases it was possible to separate coarse pumice fragments by hand picking after this procedure. For the enrichment of the volcanic particles in the finer grained samples, a newly developed magnetic separation technique was applied.2 This procedure led to tephra particle concentrations of up to 95%, starting from about 50%. In general, all preparation steps were accompanied and evaluated by polarisation microscopy. 1 Bichler et al. 2002; Peltz et al. 1999; Bichler et al. 2004; Steinhauser et al. 2006a; Steinhauser et al. 2006A; Sterba et al. 2006; Steinhauser et al. 2007. 2 Wartmann 2008. 323</page><page sequence="351">PALAIKASTRO BLOCK M: THE PROTO- AND NEOPALATIAL TOWN .

After each irradiation, two series of measurements were performed, the first after 5 days to determine the elements with shorter half-lives, the second run after 4 weeks for the longer-lived radionuclides. Thus 25 geochemically relevant elemental concentrations were determined within the samples, in particular As, Ba, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Eu, Fe, Hf, K, La, Lu, Na, Nd, Rb, Sb, Sc, Sm, Ta, Tb, Th, U, Yb, Zn, and Zr. For quantitative analysis, reference materials NIST SRM 1633b Coal Fly Ash, MC Rhyolith GBW 07113, CANMET reference soil SO-i, Light Sandy Soil BCR No. 142, and NIST SRM 2702 Inorganics in Marine Sediment were used as comparators. An in-house reference material made from original pumice from the Minoan eruption of Santorini (Thera) has been analysed in the same series for quality control. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION The analytical results were combined to so-called chemical fingerprints and compared to the data of previously analysed eruptive material from the Aegean islands (fig. A. 1).3 It is shown that the tephra content of eight soil-samples originates from the Minoan eruption (Santorini BO, oberer Bimsstein). For many of the elements and especially the rare earth elements (REE) there is still a slight dilution effect observable due to the persistent presence of particles derived from the local soil. Another type of contamination leads to an enrichment in chromium (Cr), arsenic (As) and antimony (Sb), an effect that has also been observed during other investigations of tephra-bearing sediments from Iasos and Miletos. It is explained by the high absorption potential of pumice for these elements from weathering solutions.4 For one of the samples (PKV-14) it is not possible to reliably decide whether the source was the Minoan eruption, or the much older Lower Pumice eruptions (Santorini BU1+BU2, unterer Bimsstein). A comparison to the older Santorinian eruptions Cape Riva (CR, age c. 21,000 years), Middle Tuff (BM, age c. 100,000 years) and Lower Pumice (BU, age c. 200,000 years) is given in figs. A.2-A.4.5 The chemical arguments are contradictory: The application of Linear Discriminant Analysis to the full set of elements determined yielded a 99% probability for PKV-14 to belong to the group BU, the binary plot using the concentration ratios of the elements zincum/cobalt (Zn/Co) versus europium/ thorium (Eu/Th) indicates BU, too (fig. A.2). However, the highly informative element europium (Eu) indicates BO (fig. A.3). But there is also a shift to lower europium concentrations observed, which is in perfect agreement with the composition of the glass of the Minoan pumice, which has been separated and analysed by Schmid et al.6 This difference between the glass and the bulk pumice composition is the result of the presence of feldspar crystals that accept a certain amount of europium atoms in their lattice. So the possibility that PKV-14 related to the Lower Pumice eruption cannot be ruled out. An additional test that proved helpful in earlier studies7 includes barium and plots the ratios europium/thorium (Eu/Th) versus barium/tantalum (Ba/Ta), but in this case the barium concentrations show an irregular depletion probably due to elution or decomposition of barium bearing minerals, rendering this argument useless (fig.
