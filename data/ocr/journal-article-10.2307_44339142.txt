<plain_text><page sequence="1">68 Queen Alcyone Halcyon days are calm and strong. She hears and loves the sailors' song. from An Alphabet of Goddesses (for Pat Douthwaite) She watches for the sudden storm and guards her captains free from harm. She sees the snake-like waterspout and shares the rowers' trembling shout. She raises up her great winged head, interposing dread for dread until tornadoes hiss and turn and sails regain the timid sun. Sometimes her wings are blue in blue as sea and sky melt in and through her brooding stillness to a scene unimaginably serene where hurricanes have never been and Alcyone is queen. But mostly men must grip the rail and hope they will not roar or quail when crashing lumps and darkness rise to pound and drown one more poor prize. Pasiphae 'Why should Aphrodite keep us down, trudging about as servants in our dim robes, testing her wine for poison, tracking her lost veils, traipsing for rouge, combs, fans, roses, toothpicks? The three Graces are the three Stupid Ones, sisters!' - So she tore off her moth-brown jellaba, and put on a topless feathery wool tunic and strutted like a Sumerian temple harlot, and then she spread out her arms and made them into wings, flapped them and danced in quick angry swoops until her feet became claws and as a bird she could scold at Aphrodite and cast a shadow over her. But Aphrodite plunged in the palace pool like a seal and came up sleek glittering august invulnerable unmatchable while jealous Pasiphae stood and screamed like a peacock, and scuttered among the garden herms with her desperate lament, sawing the impotent air.</page><page sequence="2">Edwin Morgan Rhea 'What was it like while you were a snake?' 'You mean when he was a snake too?' 'Who, Zeus?' 'Zeus, who else! Well, it was different. It was certainly slitherier, if you like that; very close, since nothing gets in the way. I thought I would never go back to crude hugs the first time I felt the slow travelling ripple: it catches every inch of you in its squeeze but in succession, severally, subtly, not with one blunt anthropomorphic gasp as four limbs fall on you dumped on a bed.' 'But - ?' 'But, yes, well, it palls. You don't really seem to get any nearer. What it lacks is purchase, resistance.' !Can't you anchor your tails - a tree, a rock?' 'No, we tried, but there was no grip. You don't exactly have a tail, you are all tail.' 'He made it, though?' 'Oh yes, after a deal of threshing and twisting about, he made it.' 'Your son.' 'What do you mean my son?' 'Zeus is your own son.' 'Zeus was a snake and I was a snake. That never came out of my womb. Use your imagination.' 'I wish I had seen it. He must have coursed you like a spaceship, you are both such titans. You must have tangled like arms of nebulas, or two galaxies passing through each other, signals for some millennial dish.' 'I'm a goddess again. Make me a wish.' Sphinx What has the head and breasts of a woman and the hungry body of a lioness and the wings of a bird of prey and the long tail of a snake lashing slowly from side to side as it lies crouched on the branch of a tree on a busy boulevard and keeps asking pedestrians what is the square root of minus one and what was the song the sirens sang and why is it easier for a rich man to ride his camel into heaven than for three million unemployed to pass through the eye of a needle and how long would it take for the genetic mutations following an all-out nuclear attack to produce a creature with the head and breasts of a woman and the hungry body of a lioness and the wings of a bird of prey and the long tail of a snake lashing slowly from side to side as it lies crouched on the branch of a tree on a busy boulevard asking pedestrians endless questions and when they cannot answer swings round its huge hungry lion-haunches and strangles them with its sphincter? I give up. 69</page></plain_text>
