<plain_text><page sequence="1">138 Herman De Dijn Naturalism, Freedom and Ethics in Spinoza By HERMAN DE DIJN (LEUVEN) Résumé La conception naturaliste de l'homme comme conatus n'est pas liée chez Spinoza à une conception éthique utilitariste, égoïste ou hédonique. Au contraire, et paradoxalement, elle est susceptible de s'accommoder d'une pensée éthique qui, à son stade le plus développé, consiste en de très hautes vertus et des sentiments religieux élevés. Ceci n'est possible que parce que le conatus est interprété comme capable d'une activité libre. Cette liberté est conçue, non pas comme une réalisation, par la volonté, de valeurs qui séduisent sans nécessitation, mais comme une activité émanant de manière spontanée ou quasi-automatique d'une source autonome, c.à.d. non déterminée par l'extérieur. 1. The problem discussed in this paper is not new. I found a clear formulation of it in this passage of an article by J. Thomas Cook1: "The recent emphasis upon the naturalistic reading of Spinoza seems fundamentally right to me, but it is hard to escape the sense that in reading him in this way we fail to do justice to the breadth of his vision. Specifically, it is difficult for many of us to understand or take seriously Spinoza's claims about the ethically salutary, emotionally satisfying effects of understanding when we construe understanding in anything like a natural-scientific way. If we think of rational understanding on a scientific model, what do we make of Spinoza's conviction that the person who rationally under- stands nature and him/herself as a part thereof is e o ipso a wise, good, strong, free and pious person? And if Spinoza's vision is a vision of nature understood scientifically, what are we prosaic and secular-minded twentieth-century types supposed to do with that element of affective religiosity - bordering on the ecstatic - which is so undeniably present in Spinoza's view?". I will not directly discuss the insights of Cook's interesting paper, with which I am very much in agreement. I would rather, in my own way, try to clarify the interesting problem presented to us in this quote. I take the understanding of this subject to be crucial for an understanding of Spinoza. 2. The most basic "moral" distinction for Spinoza is the distinction between free man and slave2. To be a slave, is not to be powerless. Even in order to persevere in existence and to develop oneself as a slave, one needs real power. Yet, the effects which are produced by a slave, are not produced by himself alone3. Whether in a state of slavery or of freedom, a human being is always a mind , i. e. a power to think . A power to think is a power to produce sequences of ideas, affects, desires (and again ideas, etc.). Slaves do not control this power; they are only a partial cause of the thought-effects they produce4. They produce these effects in cooperation with other things. The sequence of effects cannot be explained here on its own; it does not follow autonomously, as the 1 J.

It is almost impossible not to begin one's life as a slave5. Slaves have no objective view about external things, about themselves, and about how everything hangs together. Therefore their affects and desires may be such that they desire and do what is objectively harmful and even self-destructive for the sort of complicated organism they are6. Even when their desires and doings lead to self-preservation and self-enhancement, this hap- pens more or less accidentally. So human beings are almost inevitably under external influence. That's why, sooner or later, their lifes turn into "a sickness unto death"7. Some, however, may be so powerful, and lucky enough to find such arrangements of circum- stances, that they can change from being slaves to being free men (at least for certain episodes in their lives)8. This happens when, in appropriate circumstances, "innate" capacities are "activated" and start their autonomous and automatic development9. A free man possesses a power of thinking producing a flow of activity not interfered with from outside. He develops desires and activities which are not simply positive ("accidentar increase in power), but self-enhancing in a special way. The life of a free man is characterized by effects which are not only positive, but autonomous. There- fore, he is reaching a "niveau d'actualisation optimum" l0. The sequence of effects of his mental power can be explained "by himself alone", this is "by God in so far as He is considered to constitute the essence of the human mind"11. The sequence of his ideas, experiences, thoughts, affects, desires forms a kind of "consistent" succession of activi- ties, linked together "intrinsically"; one needs no reference to "the common order of nature" to understand why they are there12. To reach the stage of freedom is like being able to concentrate all of one's power of thinking "in oneself, to develop all the "implications" of what is there, and to revel in this development. It is to produce in reality (in the reality of one's life as an existing mind) the effects "involved" in one's "eternal essence" (the amount of effects God can only produce "through us", in so far as he is us)13. The model of free activity is here clearly the activity of a scientist who understands something "in a geometrical way", by deducing all the conclusions implied in the true premises14. As to the change in human life from slavery to freedom, we can form the following 5 See passages like V P 39 Sch and TEI, p. 21 (§ 44) (all page-references to works of Spinoza are to Edwin Curle/s translation of The Collected Works of Spinoza, Vol. I, Princeton, 1985). 6 IV P 20 Sch. 7 See TEI, p. 9 (§ 7): "like a man suffering from a fatal illness". 8 See passages like II P 29 Sch + V P 39 Sch (etc., e. g.

He badly needs external help to become a mature slave (e. g. he must grow from infant to adult). So he must be very lucky in his encounters. Having reached a certain stage of development as a slave, some men can really activate their dormant "innate" capacities and give them free reign: they become really free men. "External" things are at the same time absolutely necessary for the growth in maturity; yet our dependence upon them and involvement with them may prove a hindrance for the transition from slave-maturity to freedom. Matheron has nicely described and analyzed the development in three stages from slavery to freedom16. Characteristic of all the stages of human desiring is the same drive to link ideas and desires more or less "consistently" together; but, except at the last stage, this effort doesn't really succeed ("consistency" only really works with adequate ideas and intellectual desires). Characteristic of all the stages is also a certain self -consciousness of the desiring, i. e. a certain self-conception, as well as a certain conception of what is good for oneself. The first stage of man's desiring is the stage of finalistic-anthropocentric illusion (as described in the Appendix of Ethics I). In this stage man is completely under the spell of hope and fear concerning external forces; these, whether real or illusory, are always pictured anthropomorphically, i. e. after the wrong picture man here has of himself (as a free will attracted towards the transcendent good). The second stage is the stage of egoistic-instrumentalist desire17. Thanks to scientific understanding, the myths (of the previous stage) are exploded, and man now thinks to be able to live a rational life, i. e. a life in the service of a clever enhancement of pleasure, aided by science and technique, and including the appropriate amelioration of socio-poli- tical organisation. In this stage, rational thinking is seen basically as a means to an end which is pleasure for its own sake. It is true that one is now no longer trying to organize one's life in terms of a superstitious view of oneself and of Nature. Yet, this second stage is not real freedom or autonomy either. The pleasures one is after no longer seem to be linked to the fascination for certain idols (which one can identify with); they are now the pleasures of an agreeable, diversified life. But these new pleasures still mean an essential dependence on things outside, however much one succeeds in planning the desired outcomes by means of science and technique. Moreover, the desires one has, are still related to the search for such pleasures as are associated with an inadequate view about oneself and one's connection with the Whole. However much one seems to have escaped the old anthropocentrism, de facto also in this stage one conceives oneself as the center of the world. It is clear that, at this second stage, there is no real interest in rational thinking itself. However much science is developed, it is considered only as a necessary, not an intrinsi- cally important activity. The interest in intellectual affairs is very vulnerable here. Yet, this stage allows, and even requires many people to engage frequently and extensively in rational thinking. In this way a third stage becomes possible, at least for a certain number of individuals: the stage of real freedom. 15 The picture is based on passages like: II P 13 Sch; II P 29 Sch; V P 39 Sch (see also IV 38 + 39 4- Sch). 16 See: A. Matheron, o. c, pp. 84 ff. 17 See: A. Matheron, o. c, pp. 85 ff. Matheron constructs what he says here out of an understand- ing of the difference between Hobbes and Spinoza (pp. 87).</page><page sequence="4">Naturalism, Freedom and Ethics in Spinoza 141 The third stage of human conatus is "nicht bloß [ . . .] das Streben nach Selbsterhal- tung durch Vernunft [...], sondern vor allem [. . .] das Streben nach Selbsterhaltung der Vernunft"18. It is the life of desiring related to "innate affection(s) of our essence" 19 : i. e. to the spontaneous development of pure intellectual thinking for its own sake, and to the "active" joy going with it. This is the life of freedom, a kind of self-determined activity, which involves a special kind of self-awareness, and which can lead to explicit self-knowledge as part of the non-personal God-Nature. This Spinozistic conception of self-determination and self-knowledge seems fundamentally different from the picture of freedom and of the self as presented by Descartes and Leibniz (and indeed most other modern philosophers). The opposition concerning these conceptions mirror strong oppositions concerning views about the Whole of Nature and man's place therein. 3. Spinoza's free man has a life of desire prompted by "innate" affections of the mind20. These can be none other than adequate ideas and accompanying active emotions21. A mind possessing adequate ideas is an intellect capable of engaging in reasoning, in demonstrations, in which one understands things sub specie aeternitatis22. The intellect no longer conceives things from the point of view of anthropocentric illusion; it conceives things from a detached perspective, which allows seeing them as they really are. If sufficiently unhindered, human power to think can now develop itself fully, follow "son cours naturel"23: it's going from one adequate idea to another, a self moving mental activity no longer determined or impeded by external factors, almost an auto- maton spirituale 24. "L'effort pour comprendre [. . .] n'est rien d'autre que le cona- tus parvenue à son plein épanouissement et à son plus haut degré d'efficience"25. In intellectual activity, man feels a new, active joy26; it is accompanied by a desire for more and more understanding27. A conversion has taken place from a life of passivity to a life of activity, i. e. a life of understanding. When our mind becomes quasi automaton spirituale, this is like a home-coming, like the return into one's natural element28 : "Le désir de connaître est la vérité du désir d'être"29. In so far as one understands adequately, one is also aware of what one is doing, and so one gets a new kind of self-esteem30. To understand things sub specie aeternita- 18 I could not trace the reference for this quote.

So, paradoxically, the pleasure and self-esteem a free man feels towards himself, concern a self indistinguishable in all important respects from the activity of any other intellect: it is no longer really "personal", even though it still is a particular thing31. Once one is "truly" oneself, one can no longer care about the old self (with its inevitable identifications with external things in its striving for honour, riches, pleasures, salvation). Viewed from the old standpoints (the " desiderium natu- rale " for what is transcendent; the " desiderium naturale " for as much pleasure as possible), the "new" desiderium naturale must look like the very negation of oneself. But from this new perspective, it is the old self which is an illusion, and its enormous frantic activity and affective investments a huge delusion. It is important to understand this new activity and this new self as clearly as possible. In a certain sense, the activity of understanding is, for a free man, an "end in itself". Indeed, in adequate thinking, one is not engaging in the activity because it seems a good (or the only) way to escape ordinary life, or because it provides a peculiar kind of pleasure. In thinking, one is not geared towards pleasure, even though the activity has its own reward32. Yet, in another sense, the activity of understanding is not an "end in itself"33 if this is supposed to mean that underneath this striving for knowledge is the striving for an Other (an End external, transcendent vis à vis human nature, and attracting us with a strange fascination). Such an "end in itself" is related to a Self which is prepared to lose itself in the pursuit of the end (even though it is also true that this ego can always become indifferent, so that the fascination no longer works). The pursuit of a free man is not to be understood in terms of such striving for "ends in themselves". His activity is geared towards an end which he cannot not have in view (unless he is overpowered and deviated by external factors), because he is this activity. What a free man strives for is not a good which he doesn't have and which would be (only) useful; neither is it a good from which he is separated and which attracts him (but which he might lose sight of or turn away from). The desire for understanding of the free man is not the result of an absence (a privatio), but of a presence, the presence of a kind of automatism, pouring itself out in a free flow of activity. There is no distance anymore between what one does and what one desires. Just as there is for Spinoza no distinction between intellect and will34, so there is here no distinction between intellect and desire. Spontaneity does not mean indifference. In the activity, a free thinker enjoys his activity, wants it to continue, and cannot but love and esteem himself in doing this. All longing, all hope and fear have gone. The presence of the active feelings and desires cannot mean there is any sense of other possibilities . A free man cannot step out of his activity. And in his joy and desire he is completely innocent (no longing, no fascination; as before the Fall). One can as well say that his activity is completely egocentric as that it is completely selfless (like the play of small children with other children). The joy of thinking and the concomitant desire to continue the flow of reasoning is not the full picture of the life of freedom. Because he lives in the real world, a free man has to 31 See: Wallace Matson: Death and Destruction in Spinoza's Ethics, in: Inquiry 20 (1977), p. 414. 32 For the relationship between "virtue" ( = "acting by the guidance of reason": IV P 24) and "reward" see: V P 42. 33 See: A. Matheron, o. c, p. 247; pp. 256-7. 34 II P 49.</page><page sequence="6">Naturalism, Freedom and Ethics in Spinoza 143 organize not only his thought, but also the persistence of it in an environment which is sometimes even hostile. Therefore a free man must also attempt to organize circumstan- ces and other people (free men and slaves). It is the whole sequence of thoughts, feelings, desires, and organizing activities which form the real life of a free intellect35. As Matheron puts it again rightly and succinctly: a life of reason consists of "connaître pour mieux organiser le monde afin de mieux connaître encore"36. What does it mean to say that intellectual activity is immediately experienced as "valuable", and how is this related to what is seen when things are seen sub specie aeternitatis ? From the detached viewpoint, from the perspective of eternity, the appeal certain things had for us, disappears: one now considers them under "the cold light" of reason. A free man can direct this "cold" gaze equally towards his own nature. Can he derive from what he sees either acceptance or rejection of himself? How could, from what can be seen or understood by any intellect, follow acceptance or rejection of a particular thing or activity (or even sort of activity)37? Yet, there is self-acceptance related to under- standing: Spinoza explicitly speaks about the self-esteem one has in knowing38. Even in the world of pure thinking, there is at least one point where there is still evaluation: a thinker cannot escape the appeal reasoning has for him as an activity. So it seems that the desire to continue understanding cannot come from what one sees in the detached view, but from the experience of one's activity of thinking. A free man cannot really detach himself from his detachment. Yet, the reason why a free man cannot escape the appeal of reasoning is not that it appears to him as a shining, overriding value for which, if necessary, he has to sacrifice himself. The reason is that he is this activity, which de facto experiences itself "in" him as joy and conscious desire to continue itself. The conscious desire is really the vis a tergo which works itself out, unhindered, as in an automaton. It is important here to stress again the difference between the desire and activity of a free man (in Spinoza's sense) and the desire and activity of a slave (as sublimated by the Christian philosophers). The absorption of a free man in his activity cannot be confused with the clinging of a slave to his illusions and identifications (in endless fluctuations of hope and fear, exultation and despair). But neither should it be confused with the supposedly free desiderium naturale for a transcendent Principle or Value. The self-consciousness and desire of a free man are but a kind of "tonality" accompanying the free-flowing activity of understanding. There is a sort of "commitment" of a free man in his activity (of detachment); but it is a kind of unselfish, non-delusioned, "free" commitment. Being a quasi-"spiritual automaton" of deductive understanding, a man of reason cannot of course want to engage in a contradiction, or to doubt what cannot be doubted. Being a free man, a man of reason cannot allow amongst his activities acts which are incompatible with the flow, even if this would bring about death39. It is not because rational thinking and acting is such a shining end that one has to be prepared to even die 35 See (e. g.): IV P 73 Sch; V P 20 Sch; V P 39 Sch; etc. JO A.

A free man thinks of nothing less than of death40. If in "being consistent with himself" he encounters death, it is because he runs into an external force which is more powerful than himself ("What had to be done, had to be done, the rest is in the hands of God"). It is because understanding is not an "end in itself", that a free man can accept death (in pursuing his activity) without being in any way pathetically self-destructive. The human intellect not only develops a natural and a human science. According to Spinoza, it can and should do this in the context of an overall philosophical framework which we today would call a version of a naturalist metaphysics. In this metaphysics is understood objectively how everything, including man is part of Nature; and how man can become "une partie totale" 41 of Nature, in which Nature's power works itself out independendy from die cooperation of any other mode. In free intellectual thinking, man is such a "partie totale" in which the reality of Substance expresses itself in a self-contained way. This objective understanding of one's place in Nature is itself a part of the flow of free-thinking activity. On it's own this is simply another piece of objective understanding. But, according to Spinoza, "dramatic" effects follow when this objective understanding gets suitably connected with the experience we have of ourselves as spontaneous intellectual activity42. At such moments we can not only know (objectively) that we are parts of Nature, but we can experience "ourselves" as parts of unbounded Life43. With a shock we realize that the activity which we are, and which we are intimately aware of, is the activity of Life itself, which simply is , uncaused and with no end in view. For this realization or experience, Spinoza reserves the name Gloria44. This experience is an experience of ultimate acceptance, of "intellectual love" for God-Nature45. It is only because the flow of activity of a free man is more than simply a concatenation of ideas, but also a concatenation of acts of experience, affects and desires (indeed a peculiar kind of self -experience), that the effects can come about which Spinoza describes as effects of knowledge of the third kind46. 4. Spinoza's conception of a free man is closely linked with a specific view about the relation between free activity and the Whole of things. The same can be said about other conceptions of freedom47. Spinoza is well aware of this. All human beings have a certain conception about their freedom and its relation to the WTiole of things. This anthropo- centric and finalistic conception is so strong, that even great scientists like Descartes (and Leibniz) succumb to it. The ordinary (e. g. Christian) picture of freedom of the will goes together with a view 40 IV P 67. 41 J.

Strawson: Freedom and Resentment and other Essays, London, 1974, pp. 1-25.</page><page sequence="8">Naturalism, Freedom and Ethics in Spinoza 145 of the world as created by a Personal God who made creation to contain also other free-willing beings whose end it is to freely serve the creator. In this picture the life of man is considered to be the outcome of an activity produced by the will as illuminated by the intellect, but as attracted (and not necessitated) by the Good. There may be variations in this picture, e. g. acceptance or rejection of contra-causal freedom (Descartes as against Leibniz); but the fundamental differences always remain: between intellect and will, between necessitation and attraction. Leibniz is well aware of his difference with Spinoza, who "divested God of intelligence and choice, leaving him a blind power, whence all emanates of necessity3'48. For Leibniz, action is not the quasi automatic, joyful outflow of activity from its source. It is the realization of a value through will and desire. The will, which is by nature geared towards the good, must conform itself to it, without being necessitated. This is real freedom. But since Leibniz rejects contra-causal freedom, he must find another way to allow for the difference between necessitation and attraction. Attraction by a norm or value does not make sense, but for the awareness of other possibilities not conforming to the norm; furthermore, the possibilities must have a ground in reality. The solution is Leibniz' doctrine of the metaphysical contingency of Creation as dependent upon the free Choice of God amongst an infinity of (- logically speaking -) equally possible worlds. God's free choice incorporated the free choices of all individuals (not conflicting with causal necessity, but with the absence of logical possibilities)49. God's reality seems here to be divided between intellect and will; even He seems to have to play the game of desiring the Good (could he have been attracted by the opposite?). In other words: God is man in disguise; this is still anthropomorphism. And is Leibniz not also wrong about intelligence? Instead of seeing it as the spontaneous production of the truth, he interprets it as fundamentally dependent on the will as directed towards, attracted by unreachable goals, the truth, which is but a modification of the Good. This makes the activity of understan- ding itself into a mere form of human delusion. As we have seen, there is also the position of a utilitarian-hedonist who no longer believes in myths or gods, but who strives, as much as possible, and with the help of science and technique and social engineering, to improve his situation. He knows that everything can be understood as a machine which strives to continue in existence. Highly developed machines like men do this, equipped with a certain intelligence and certain capacities of manipulation, in their strivings for pleasureful experiences. A hedonist knows he himself is such a highly developed machine, which cannot refrain from being this striving for as much pleasure as possible. But, although partly true, this naturalistic picture of man betrays the incapacity of a utilitarian-hedonist to really let go of the old view of the self, and to see one's true self at work in rational activity as such. This naturalistic position is full of contradictions. A hedonist knows Nature is not there for him, yet he cannot but act as if it were the case. He rejects the old view of the self as attracted by Value, and sees himself as a machine for the production of pleasant experien- ces. Yet, what he in fact strives for are not just pleasures (as he claims them to be), but 48 Leibniz: Theodicy. Essays on the Goodness of God, the Freedom of Man, and the Origin of Evil (transi. E. M. Huggard), London, 1951, p. 348 (§ 371). 49 See: A. Burms and H.

Spinoza's metaphysics is much closer to the naturalism of a utilitarian-hedonist, than to the theism of a slave or the modern metaphysical versions of it. But his naturalist conception strangely combines with a view of human nature and of free activity incompa- tible with the utilitarian-hedonistic picture (or rather showing the delusion present in it). Human nature is seen here as the inevitable product of the infinite, purposeless Divine Activity - but the activity of human life is understood as, at its highest development, a spontaneous, joyful production of understanding, i. e. as "a life of reason". In such a view, the pursuit of pleasure is not seen as bad in se , but as inferior activity, a form of slavery. Should we say then - as has been suggested51 - that Spinoza's free man resembles the sage of the Stoics who is capable of taking the point of view of the Whole? In a certain sense this is true: in so far as he understands things sub specie aeternitatis , man takes the point of view of the Whole, sees things as God's own Intellect sees them. But in another sense the comparison is false. For the Stoics, to take the point of view of the Whole meant to live in accordance with nature, to care as Nature itself would care (for the harmony of the Whole). For Spinoza this is nonsense; it is again a version of anthropomorphism. Nature doesn't care, it simply acts. A free man "cares" about himself (in a non-deluded way); he desires his activity to continue52. Yet, this does not mean Spinoza's free man has no intimate relationship with Nature. He can know that his life of autonomous activity is part of the overall purposeless activity of God-Nature, that his life is only one of the infinitely many concrete effects of the unbounded Life-force, that it is Deusquatenus... This knowledge can be accompanied with experiences of great joy and acceptance, with an intellectual love for the impersonal God-Nature, who loves nobody, yet loves us i n our love. Strange and paradoxical as it may seem, Spinoza's naturalistic conception of man as conatus is not linked with instrumentalism, egoism or hedonism. On the contrary it can seemingly accomodate the highest virtues and religious sentiments: friendship, courage, acceptance, . . . 53. This is undoubtedly related to his conception of the "life of reason" as a life which escapes the delusions of the Self and of its Utopian disguise (the Good). It is perhaps even more strange and paradoxical to learn that Spinoza himself recogni- zed that there are other non-Spinozistic forms of morality and religiosity which as a matter of fact also produce real salvation. Reading his Ethics, it seems as if there is only one way of life which is "in accordance with our nature", and produces real joy and happiness: the life of reason of a free man. But in his Theologico-Political Treatise, he admits that the religion of purified Christianity, a religion preaching a personal God ( !), can lead to a form of salvation. There is no reason to think Spinoza to be dishonest 50 This critique is especially applicable to Hobbes, see A. Matheron, o. c, p. 87 ff. 51 See e. g. N. Rotenstreich: Conatus and Amor Dei: The Total and Partial Norm, in: Revue Internationale de Philosophie 31 (119-120), 1977, p. 124 (Rotenstreich^ comparison is made with many qualifications). 52 There is a striking difference in this respect between the Stoical and the Spinozistic attitude with respect to suicide. 53 See: IV P 67 and following; V P 32 and following.</page><page sequence="10">Naturalism, Freedom and Ediics in Spinoza 147 here54. If we look carefully at the sort of life evangelical Christians are supposed to live, maybe we can understand a little how it too can provide real happiness. Purified Christianity induces in its believers attitudes of unselfish obedience to God, whom they trust without any fear, and serve in works of justice and charity. Through these attitudes they reach a sort of acquiescentia in se ipso , comparable to the internal peace of a free man in his activity55. What seems analogous in both kinds of salvation is the internal peace, joy and acceptance provided by a non-self-centered, out-flowing, joyful activity, which escapes the misery of ordinary, conceited and deluded self-awareness. In the kind of "universal" religiosity Spinoza sees exemplified in purified Christianity, it is not the practice of autonomous rational activity which is the lever of salvation. What saves good Christians has nothing to do with philosophizing, or science, or theology. It is the consistent non-selfish, yet joyful practice of charity and justice which "does the trick" (even though the practice is related to what are "in se" inadequate beliefs, but held non-dogmatically and "in good faith"). The religious practice is not a practice of self-negation, but an innocent concentration on the requirements of daily life and of the needs of those around us. Obviously, this sort of practice might be related to other religions as well. 5. Spinoza's naturalism is of a very peculiar kind. It sees all activity, also all human activity as forms of life produced by an unbounded Life-force, acting without any end in view. But the force of life typical for human nature is not understood here as a drive for pure "biological" survival, taking the concrete form of a drive for pleasure. It is under- stood as a force trying to produce a concatenation of internally related "rational" activities (including highly "moral" and "religious" feelings and desires). Although the truth of the human con a tu s is the endeavour of rationality, this does not imply that there was an end in Nature after all: i. e. to produce this marvellous organism capable of taking everything in its own hands in function of a glorious future where man will be god to man. The rationality of human beings is seen here as just one of the many life- forms of Nature's purposeless and center-less production. The unselfish caring for one's own rationality is as it were the experiential counterpart to this naturalistic truth. What seems most typical for Spinoza is not that he was the first to develop a radical naturalistic philosophy as a worldview best adapted to the new sciences; nor that he made rational understanding into the centre of a new morality ("une éthique de la connaissan- ce" as Jacques Monod called it); but that he intertwined these two so as to create a morality of rationality as the origin of all real virtues and even of a kind of religiosity. This morality and religiosity are fundamentally different from the traditional Christian picture of morality and religiosity, interpreted in terms of freedom of the will as separated from and at the same time attracted by transcendent Value.

In the above comparison of Spinoza and Leibniz, I deliberately disregarded what Spinoza says in Ethics IV. The perspective of a life consisting in spontaneous intellectual activity is - if anywhere - (rather) described in Ethics V. In book IV Spinoza himself clearly talks about longing for an end (the true good, the ideal of human nature), and there can be no doubt that Spinoza is talking here about and for Spinozists (IV Preface: "... we desire to form an idea of man, as a model of human nature which we may look to ..."). This raises questions such as: what is the difference between the desire Spinoza is talking about here, and the longing for an end Leibniz is describing; or what is the relationship between the perspective of Book IV and that of Book V of the Ethics} These questions must be answered in order to go beyond generalities and to come to a deeper understanding of Spinoza and of his difference from Leibniz. At this moment, I can do no more than make some suggestions about the difference between Ethics IV and V, hoping these suggestions hold up to further investigation and discussion. What is presented in Book IV is the picture of an ideal, the man guided by reason, and of the means to reach that ideal ( = the precepts of reason). Book IV tells us in detail what these precepts of reason are, what a man of reason, following these precepts, does, and what characterizes him, what his desires and emotions are. Notice the strange fact that this picture is presented in a Book bearing the general tide "On human bondage". Notice also that concerning this ideal, Spinoza himself says that its knowledge and the longing for it, produce their own misery56. The morals contained in Book IV form a handbook of precepts or guidelines (a kind of "Cook-book of Life"), meant for those who are in the paradoxical situation of longing for real freedom (because they know it "abstractly" 57 or remember having been in that state), but without really possessing it. It is a paradoxical situation because the very longing for freedom, hinders in a way its realization (which - as spontaneity - is beyond longing). Book IV contains an "inte- rim"-morality; it concerns a state inbetween pure slavery and real freedom58: a state which can be compared with the state of desiring to be spontaneous, which is of course opposed to being spontaneous59. The longing for the ideal described in Book IV is "selfish": man in the interim-situation strives for the ideal as a good for him and uses all sorts of tricks to get what he wants (even the knowledge of God is presented here as such a trick, a precept). In his attitude towards the ideal, man shows he has not yet given up all illusions about himself (as a separate entity). Knowledge (even of God) is a means towards self-assertion; not a state of selfforgetfulness and unconcern in the activity itself. Still, this "selfish" self compares favourably with the self which is under the illusions of "ordinary morality" or with the hedonistic self. At least his strivings are based on scientific insights in the laws governing human power and affectivity. It is in Ethics V that we have to look for an account of real freedom.

Here he is no longer talking about pre- cepts we have to follow in our longing. Here he indicates the operative remedies ^ which constitute real power, real freedom. The perspective is no longer prescriptive (as in Book IV) but descriptive of real power, and of how it operates. Paradoxically these remedies all seem to come down somehow to knowledge of oneself, more precisely of one's emotions: is this not incompatible with the way we earlier described real freedom (in terms of the selff orgetfulness, unconcern for oneself, etcetera, present in pure intellectual activity)? In order to clarify this, we have to investigate more closely what this knowledge is in which freedom realizes itself. What Spinoza is talking about here, is not simply adequate knowledge in general (not even about human emotions). The knowledge of the emotions which gives real peace of mind, is rather a special way of reacting to one's own emotions inevitably encountered in daily life61. These emotions become occasions for a certain kind of thinking about oneself in which the impact of the emotions is defused such that they nó longer disturb the mind's autonomous activity; on the contrary, the thinking in which this defusion happens can even turn into a contemplative experience. In other words whatever happens to us, it becomes part of a mental life which is active, joyful and peaceful, and which contains moments of "intuitive insight" and "intellectual love of God"62. The fundamental remedy against passivity (lack of freedom), consists in looking at one's own concrete emotions sub specie aeternitatis : our own concrete thinking and emotional life becomes a spectacle for ourselves in which - thanks to our adequate thinking - we take a distance from these concrete emotions, yet without denying them. (Compare with Spinoza's conception of adequate thinking as not denying sensory per- ception). How is it possible for such a special consideration of our own emotions to arise? The focus of attention must shift from the frenetic occupancy (with what is felt as good or bad) present in ordinary emotionality. Yet our attention may not lose contact altogether with the emotion and obliterate it by a completely different act of consciousness. In other words, in the distancing from it, the emotion must get defused, but something of it must linger on; the real emotion gets caught up in a framework in which it appears in a new light and affects us differently63. Strawson has called our attention to the fact that most of us in certain circumstances are capable of obtaining a distancing view of the turmoil of our own and other's emotional life - in this view our lives do not become completely alien to us, but they appear in a different light (often consoling or liberating). According to Strawson this sort of detachment is inevitably isolated; it cannot mean much more than a momentary amazement doomed to disappear when the usual involvements are resumed64. Spinoza seems to suggest that such a distancing can in certain people occupy their minds more 60VP20Sch. 61 V P 4 Sch; P 6 Sch; P 10 Sch; P 15; etc. 62 VP 14-16. OJ V 1J 4 beh. 64 See: P. F.

Whatever happens to them becomes part of a mental life which is fundamentally undisturbed; they escape the usual clinging to illusions to which we normally are so prone in ordinary emotional life. It is not sufficient to acquire the habit of looking at things in general sub specie aeternitatis ; - in and through the distancing view we should be confronted in a special way with our own existential (emotional) reality. As Santayana said, expressing Spinozi- stic religiosity: "My own eclipse, my own vices, my own sorrows, may become a subject to me for exact calculation and a pleasing wonder. The philosophical eye may compose a cosmic harmony out of these necessary conflicts, and an infinite life out of these desirable deaths"65. Only thus can we really break through our accustomed way of seeing ourselves (of taking ourselves too seriously in our emotional life). Only then can we really experience ourselves as modifications of God's overflowing life-force; in other words experience "the original truth" about ourselves ("sentimus experimurque nos aeternos esse")66. 65 George Santayana: Ultimate Religion, in: Septimana Spinozana (Acta conventos oecumenici in memoriam B.
