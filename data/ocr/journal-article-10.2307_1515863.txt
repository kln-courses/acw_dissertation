Copenhagen AAGE BENTZEN THE ORIGIN OF THE NAME METATRON In the Metatron figure of Talmud, Targum, Midrashim, and the writings of later Jewish mysticism, the conception of a mediator or intermediary between God and man reaches its most developed form in Judaism. According to one view of this peculiar deviation in Judaism, the patriarch Enoch, after his translation and a kind of heavenly transformation, was raised to the rank of the first of the angels or 'Prince of the Presence' (sar ha-pannim). He received the name Metatron, and occupied a throne next to the throne of glory, exercising both judicial and intercessory functions. Like the earlier Enoch, Enoch-Metatron was the heavenly scribe and the revealer of divine secrets, but with his quasi-apotheosis, Metatron assumed divine status. He is the angel of whom it is said at Exod xxiii 20, 'Take ye heed of him.. for my name is in him.' (Cf. Sanh. 38b). In the Sepher Hanoch or III Enoch, Metatron is designated 'the lesser JHWH' (xii 5), with which may be compared the Gnostic 'lesser IAO', a title given to the Hellenistic Anthropos. In view of this, it is not surprising that, like the frankly anthropomorphic ideas of the Shiur Komah, the Metatron cult aroused the bitterest antagonism in orthodox rabbinical circles. At any rate the idea that Metratron should become an object of worship is repudiated (Sanh., l.c.). The name Metatron is a minor mystery, and a great deal has been written about it. In a full and scholarly discussion, Hugo ODEBERG considers the various possibilities, 1) and decides that the most pro- bable explanation is that Metatron is a transcription of [i?zTOp6vLoS, 'signifying the celestial being next to the divine throne' (p. 137). Apart however from the serious philological objections to such a formation as ieT060p6VLoq, there is not, as Gershom SHOLEM pointed out 2), 'the slightest suggestion that the author (of Sepher Hanoch) saw any connection between the name of the archon and his throne.' Other derivations are even less probable, such as those connecting the word with Mithras, V-reTro6pocvvo, .nlrTp etc. 1) 3 Enoch (Cambridge, 1928), pp. 125-142. 2) Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (Jerusalem, 1941), p. 68. 217</page><page sequence="2">SHORT NOTES The least objectionable derivation is that which sees in the word a Hebraisation of the Latin metator, 'measurer' (Graecised, T&amp;aTc0op, itraT0op). 1) The Latin word passed into Hebrew as a borrowing and evidently commended itself, in its technical sense of 'Grenzab- stecker', to describe the angel who showed Moses the land 'and told him how far the area of the individual tribes stretched' 2); it also appropriately described the angel who acted as the 'praecursor' and 'praeparator' of Israel (Exod xxiii 20 ff.) 'The reduplication of the t and the ending ron follow a pattern which runs through all these texts. Both the ending and the repetition of the consonant are observable, for instance, in names like Zoharariel and Adiriron. It must also be borne in mind that on and ron may have been fixed and typical constituents of secret names rather than meaningful syllables.' 3) This derivation has the support of such famous names as ELEAZAR of Worms (ob. 1237 A.D.), NACHMANIDES, and, in more recent times, FRIEDLXNDER, G. F. MOORE, Edouard MEYER and G. DALMAN. MOORE writes: 'Metator (Metatron) is originally an appellative borrowed and first used in its proper, almost tech- nical sense, an officer who goes in advance of an army,.. Israel's metator in the desert was God himself or an angel assigned.. by him to this task. This office was most naturally filled by Michael, the champion of the Jews.' 4) DALMAN gives metator and metatron as alternatives in his Worterbuch. 5) A hitherto unnoticed piece of evidence is to be found in Philo's Quaestiones in Genesin 4, where, among other titles of the Logos (primum principium, i.e. )pyP, originalis species or archetypa idea), we findpraemetitor orprima mensura universorum. The Armenian word is rendered by Aucher by these alternatives, but there cannot have been any ambiguity in the lost Greek original; in view of the translation of xpXI by primum principium, it was most probably simply ,u?p7-qT. If we assume an original Vepi'xpl , then we have the Greek equivalent of the Latin metator, 'measurer' applied to the Logos. 1) For the full evidence, consult ODEBERG, l.C. 2) Cf.

MOORE was anxious to show that Metatron was not a mediator; cf. ODEBERG, p. 131. 5) Aramiisch-Neuhebraisches Worterbuch, p. 222. 218</page><page sequence="3">SHORT NOTES The title does not again occur in Philo, but it may have arisen by the application of the Platonic idea of man as 'the measure of all things' to Philo's Ideal Man. 1) However the word is to be explained, its connection with Metatron is very probable; the alteration of Metator to the vox mystica Metatron may not only have followed a regular pattern, but also have been determined by the Gematria (Metatron = 314 = Shaddai). 2). This connection with Philo further supports the view originally propounded by Friedlander that the Metatron figure came ultimately into Judaism from Philo's Logos. 3) In Friedlander's opinion, it was mediated by an older form of Jewish Gnosticism concerned with the cult of the Egyptian divine Dynamis Horus. But Philo was the ultimate source; the Angel of Exod xxiii 20 who bears the divine name is the Xoyo6s 0LoS (de migrat. Abraham, 174). 4) If this is so, then we have further striking evidence of the influence of Philonic teaching on Judaism. 5) Leeds M. BLACK HIT'AMER (Deut.

In the light of this fresh evidence ODEBERG'S discussion of FRIEDLANDER (op. cit., p. 144) requires considerable modification.
