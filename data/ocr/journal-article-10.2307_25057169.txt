<plain_text><page sequence="1">READING THE REVELS The Riddle of May Day in New English Canaan JACK DEMPSEY I ask the reader to excuse these rhymes if they are not as well-polished as a well-bred man would wish. They were made in haste. But never theless I have a wish to insert them here because they serve as a part of our history and to show that we lived joyously. French planter &amp; attorney Marc Lescarbot, postscript to The Theatre of Neptune, performed in New France 1606 Until recent decades, most remarks about the career of Thomas Morton of Ma-re Mount have had two points of acrimonious de parture: his New England plantation's relatively personal relations with Northeastern Native Americans, and his trading guns to them for the choicest pelts of the fur-trade. Objections against the interracial, erotic, and economic practices of Morton's small group of straggling planters, inscribed in the criminal statutes and personal writings of his contempo rary Puritan rivals and in the texts of critics and historians schooled in their values, explicitly made mortal sins of both "intermarriage" of any kind and gun-trade to "Indians": both were synonymous with subversion of Puritan-English empire.1 Erotic relations and gun-trade with Native people, however, were very much the human contexts of Canaan's "The Poem" and "The Song," which Morton's company publicly performed and "fixed" to their Maypole over Massachusetts Bay during the May Day Revels staged there in 1627. Can we solve the long-standing "riddle" that the Ma-re Mount trappers and plant ers ("the authors of these Revels" 135) wove into these poems? The "Poem" and "Song" articulate their plantation's history, celebrate it, and deliver a manifesto or formula for successful colonizing. In order to consolidate their growing strength as competitors for the Northeastern fur-trade, Mor ton and his colleagues took up discourses and popular cultural forms of the Renaissance, combined them with the most widespread practices of trade in the first 100 years of Northeast contact, and used these to address (in both self-interest and compassion) the people of Native American New England, who were then suffering the aftermath of catastrophic "plague."2 English trade of guns to Native Americans had begun by the late 1500s, with the earliest West Country fishermen and fur-traders who spent time 283</page><page sequence="2">284 Early American Literature, Volume 34,1999 ashore long enough to salt their catches of cod, some of them wintering in crude encampments along the northern shores of the New-Found-Land. Traffic in firearms, whether "loaned" to Native men to expedite the flow of pelts from inland trap-lines, or traded outright, apparently brought Mor ton the lion's share of New England trade for a brief time, between his post-1624 takeover of "Ma-re Mount" and his first arrest in June 1628. It was, he hinted, his way of "comply[ing]" with America's preexisting prac tices in order to "carry her," or outdo New England trading-rivals (135). Quinn's "Renaissance Influences" (79) details earlier attempts in Ireland and the Northeast to purchase "a loyal nucleus" of Native trading-partners, a practice borrowed from imperial Roman policy by way of Machiavelli. Ma-re Mount's timing was right: the demand for guns in Native south ern New England had sharpened with the early 1600s and was fundamen tal to the Ma-re Mount settlement's early success. It does appear the case that they complied with "the occurrents of the time" (131) on both English and Native sides of transatlantic trade. Mindful of these circumstances, we come to Ma-re Mount's poetry with the realization that the intercultural human behaviors most prominent in descriptions of those earliest American fish-and-trade ventures were also the most prominent Puritan charges against Morton's kinds of colonial interaction: "irregular" trade (especially in guns), cohabitation with Native women (to Bradford "abusing the Indian women most filthily"; Letters 62), and communal rites (generally called "revels") often performed by Native peoples and Europeans "many days together."3 Providing witty, magnanimous diversions to a sophisticated audience in exchange for social and economic favors was a strategy Morton learned in London's Inns of Court,4 and he practiced it on the American frontier with inventiveness. His likely years at the Inns had seen 1594's extraordi nary Gesta Grayorum ("Entertainments at Gray's Inn"), a days-long spec tacle for Queen Elizabeth I that entailed the creation of a mock-Court and included lyricists and orators such as Thomas Campion and Sir Francis Bacon, processions and government-cavalry reviews through the streets of London, arrays of torch-lit barges on the Thames, and indoor presenta tions of brief poetic narratives mixed with dances. Gesta Grayorum was to crystallize into the English court masque in the hands of young Ben Jonson and younger Shakespeare (Welsford 162-63; Nichols ed. of Gesta). Early in these performances for the Queen, as soon as the mock-court stood established (of "Mighty Prince Henry, Prince of Purpoole"), offices, arms and "royal" pardons were issued, followed by various bizarre ora tions and concluding with "dancing till late," till the Queen retired. As the days of shows wore on, an "altar" was set up for "sacrifices" and incense to the "Goddess Amity," round which "ladies" danced as "Nymphs and Fairies, with instruments of musick, and . . . very pleasant melody with</page><page sequence="3">New English Canaan and The Riddle of May Day 285 viols and voices . . . hymns and praises to her deity" (18). Again, an array of "counselors" delivered ridiculous orations on "learned mysteries" and the secrets of "Trismegistus" (24). Midway through its proceedings came the performance most relevant to Morton's poetry, "Proteus and the Ada mantine Rock." Its wisp of a story concerned the Renaissance figure of change and of human potential, the seaside Greek demigod Proteus (Homer's "Old Man of the Sea"; Odyssey, Book 4), and his magical island, with whose written-in "magnetic" powers he had imprisoned the Prince and his "seven knights." An "Esquire" arrived to rescue the men and delivered a speech proving to the willful Proteus that the "true attractive Rock of Hearts" was Elizabeth herself (46). Proteus admitted himself outmatched and, with no choice but to set her seven knights free, he struck the island scenery with his staff. As he looked on (with his "attendants" including one named "Amphitrite," below), the men emerged from within it "in a very stately mas [que] ... in couples, and before every couple came two pigmies with torches.... [They] danced a new-devised measure.... After which, they took unto them ladies; and with them they danced their gal liards, courants. . . . And they danced another new measure" (49). (This performance-adjourning-to-dance is the structure of Canaan's "Revels" chapter.) Gesta then shifted its shape again: an "Antimas[que] of Mounte banks" took form in which "The greatest master of medicine Aesculapius" appeared with his "fellow artists of severall nations" (60), to perform a healing by means of "musical charms," songs sung with a "Chorus": What is't you lacke, what would you buy, What is it that you need; Come to me, gallants, taste and buy, Heer's that will doe the deed... Ailments addressed included old age, "Lost maidenhead," "greife of the spleene": verses spoke to each ailment with a comic incantation of cure, and the Chorus cautioned at last, "Yet let us not [in] too much lyccor de light" (62), a fine pun somewhere between "liquor" and Homer's ichor, the substance of divine beings. In Gesta this referred to a "powder" mixture distributed by the healer that "preserved" one from "fate" (60): "Nectar" was to be Morton's term for such a substance in his "Song," the second half of Ma-re Mount's Revels. Finally in Gesta, a "player" named "Parradox" appeared, to mock vir tually everything from the learned circles of ancient Athens to current religious factions ("my father a J?suite, my mother an Annabaptist" 65). So closed this generation-and-more's most impressive Inns of Court enter tainment, with a few short lyrical songs in honor of "the Kinge of Love and Pleasure" and the raising of a "May-pole" onstage. Players were to "circle</page><page sequence="4">286 Early American Literature, Volume 34,1999 it with your caprians [fertility-related] daunces" in honor of the "Feast of Venus Citherea" (72), "Parradox" in the lead with "his Disciples." Gesta was a rainbow of literary genres and rhetorical styles, of sym bolic actions and powerful displays of language that commanded attention and respect.5 The compelling exhilaration of performing/watching it came from its existence as an "emblem" of actual Elizabethan power, as an often daring dialogue with as well as entertainment for the ruling class. With no overarching "plot," its unity lay in its creative and diplomatic negotiations of power relationships, of the frontiers between celebration and satire. And as we might expect here in "law school" at the Inns, the young men both performing and watching it were exhorted by Gesta to "make emblems" of their own (21). In this sense, Gesta shared what William Keach has shown to be a part of much Inns of Court poetic production for this period?a kind of poetry densely woven from mythology and esot?rica but, nonethe less, rooted in an "articulated consciousness of the immediate historical context" (40). In this dynamic and learned atmosphere, young Thomas Morton ac quired his mythic vocabulary and developed his rhetorical powers in the practice of making "emblems" of the people and events at hand. For ex ample, he characterized his and his indentured servants' American situa tion in Gesta's terms. Like "Prince Henry" stranded with seven knights on an "attractive" yet confining "rock," Morton had found himself by 1626 in New England with seven servants of an original company of 30: he then reorganized this failing "Mt. Wollaston" into his own successful "Ma-re Mount" by means described above (voyage-documents in Holly). By 1627's Revels, the youths had grown seasoned enough to want to settle down, de siring to have wives "brought over to them, [which] would save them a voyage" (Canaan 134; and on the early, widespread practice of cohabitation and/or intermarriage see Canny "Permissive").6 As his fur-trade profited further from those youths' close relations with Native women, Morton smiled?in a phrase no longer so cryptic?that "He that played Proteus (with the help of Priapus) put their noses [at Plimoth] out of joynt." He had set those seven knights "free" to pursue their desires for life and wife, and this (with the gun-trade) had spelled Ma-re Mount's success as a plan tation. Cognizance of these general elements?firearms, rivalry for Native American trade-partnership, England's Inns culture, intercultural and inter personal attractions in America?equips us to read Ma-re Mount's sophis ticated productions. We can perceive Morton working like a good lawyer, appropriating all available means (here, young men's desires, Native de mands and lifeways, one's cultural education) for winning ends. What ends? And how does "The Poem" speak to and involve its hearers</page><page sequence="5">New English Canaan and The Riddle of May Day 287 to achieve them? As we read through this esoteric oration, we notice the sudden clarity of its final couplet, which breaks away from that pied lan guage into a "proclamation" for all to hear and understand.7 Indeed, the "Poem" is more than concerned with "some contemporary occurrence": it is constructed to address what in 1627 appeared to be America's very malleable future, both its promise and the threats to it. You, the colo nist/reveler/reader, are the one who must "Rise Oedipus," and grasp, even practice the mysterious subtleties read aloud, danced, and "fixed to the Maypole"8?that embodiment of long-standing colonial formulas for life and prosperity in New England (text slightly modernized from 131-32): The Poem Rise Oedipus, and if thou canst, unfold What means Charybdis underneath the mould, When Scilla, solitary on the ground (sitting in form of Niobe) was found; Till Amphitrite's Darling did acquaint Grim Neptune with the tenor of her plaint, And caused him send forth Triton, with the sound Of trumpet loud; at which the seas were found So full of Protean forms that the bold shore Presented Scilla a new paramour, So strong as Samson, and so patient As Job himself? directed thus, by Fate To comfort Scilla so unfortunate. I do profess, by Cupid's beauteous mother, Here's Scogan's choice for Scilla, and none other; Though Scilla's sick with grief because no sign Can there be found of virtue masculine. Aesculapius come: I know right well His labor's lost when you may ring Her knell, The Fatal Sisters' Doom none can withstand ?Nor Citherea's Power; Who points to land With proclamation that the first of May At Ma-re Mount shall be kept hollyday. A few chief aspects: "The Poem" consists of three complete sentences (of 13, 4, and 6 lines), and is laced with many "triplicities" that show these authors involving their audience by playing upon many different traditions and kinds of written and spoken language (including Native American ones). We must bear in mind that "The Poem" was written to be read and perhaps acted-out, before a multicultural crowd on a hilltop overlooking the sea; and that its first words demonstrate to that crowd why they (and we)</page><page sequence="6">288 Early American Literature, Volume 34,1999 are assembled?to call upon a "spirit," for information on a matter "under neath the mould," literally at the feet of the person declaiming. (No doubt this was done with the Inns' special blend of true formality and pure play.) Some of those "threes" in "The Poem" would have evoked, then, a seance or public consultation of an oracle. Its rising pitch and ardor, as it calls upon figure after figure for an answer to its question, makes "The Poem" something of a three-part incantation or prayer (in Christian, "pagan," and Native American traditions the number 3 is of endless significance). There is also a narrative here that moves in threes: its story unfolds spatially, from sea to shore to land (" 'Scilla' was found by speaker T and then ..."), and from past to present to future time (she was found; here is a choice; we shall keep this day). Further, "The Poem" invokes three famous healers for the world of human troubles it describes: Oedipus vs. "plague" in Thebes; "forms" of "Proteus," who gave remedy for a diseased ancient-world plantation; and Asklepios, whose cult in Rome began with his help against epidemic (more on each below). These "threes" that make up the three main sen tences, a structure not unlike the good riddle asked of Oedipus himself, work together to drive "The Poem" toward a "comfort," if not exactly a cure, for the "sick." They build up and bear their rhetorical fruit in a cou plet which is also a very understandable proclamation. Thus, "The Poem," as a written/spoken form, appropriates many kinds of shared language acts in order to inspire further human actions. It entices and orders those actions according to long-prevailing customs of literal and figurative cou pling, within springtime's "hollyday" tradition.9 Prayer, riddle, story, healing, proclamation. These kinds of speech serve as a symbolic and allusive guide through "The Poem," which evokes a number of humans and demigods of myth, history, and folk-culture. For ex ample, Morton says he "raised" Oedipus as "the absolute reader of riddles" (135). Oedipus is also, in Ovid's Metamorphoses (book 7,176; as in older works by Sophocles and Apollodorus) triumphant against two "plagues" of disease afflicting his city. Morton's Oedipus seems called upon to read a riddle concerning epidemic. He and (by identification) the speaker on the hill want to know "What means" that "whirlpool" of the mortal body's dissolution, death "underneath the mould"?with reference to conditions "Here," and at this time ("When" this "Scilla" was "found" and it led to May Day's "proclamation").10 But the answer, though "we" are led on with all the implicit gratifica tions of "hollyday," will be known one step at a time: without "Scilla . . . in form of Niobe" we cannot begin to learn what this epidemic "means" for us, as a crowd of different peoples atop the hill. The "order" prom ised by this "hollyday" is to be neither brutish nor anarchical: to get there, she must be our first concern. Who is "Scilla-Niobe," and why does she</page><page sequence="7">New English Canaan and The Riddle of May Day 289 sit "solitary" in grief? " The "authors of these Revels" needed Renaissance imagery to address the 1627 character and condition of Native America. Morton and company, in their effort to understand Native peoples at least enough to enlist their help, noticed and responded in these Revels and poems to the most catastrophic human event in seventeenth-century New England: the "Great Mortality" of "plague" and/or other diseases that between 1616 and 1619 killed as many as ninety percent of an estimated 90,000-135,000 Native Americans inhabiting lands from Maine to Con necticut.12 This grieving woman is inscribed "in threes" herself, as attrac tive "nymph" (like Scilla, below), as widow (gloss to 135), and as mother Niobe. Indeed, both Scilla and ?iobe resonate strikingly with the colonial events that brought mass death by epidemic from England to the Northeast. In Canaan, Natives "it seems boasting of their strength" to some resent ful French captives "said that they were so many that God could not kill them" (19). This "innocent arrogance" resembles Niobe's claim in Greek myth. This "loveliest of women" in Ovid's Roman telling boasted that her wealth and many beautiful children rivaled those of the Gods, and Niobe lived to lament their loss.13 This woman's "first name," however, is Scilla: we must turn back to Classical myth, to Thomas Lodge and the Inns, and to the Native American landscape for help on how to read this fundamen tal first sentence of the three.14 In Ovid's influential telling, young woman Scilla's seaside refusals of many suitors' advances were not a reason to punish her: when "paramour" Glaucus made his bid (himself "only recently" a man of the sea, 309), Scilla went her way, with less fortunate friend Galatea noting that "at least the men who seek your love are not ruthless . . . and you can refuse them, as you do, with impunity" (305). Scilla's own interests and "interiority" con sisted mainly of enjoying her pleasant natural surroundings, and Ovid gave us this uncomplicated life as neither idyllic nor doomed. It simply went on, until Glaucus sought out sorceress Circe for a love-charm. Circe her self fell in love with Glaucus and, when refused, she spitefully made Scilla "monstrous" by poisoning her favorite tidal pool. This created a circle of fierce "dogs" about Scilla's lower abdomen. And she, in sympathetically rendered anger of her own, became a danger to passing sailors such as Odysseus's crew. At last, for her attacks on sailors who were still nonethe less drawn to her, Scilla was transformed into a great stone land-form by the sea. A redoubtable woman, victimized by others' needs and problems, with respectable feelings of her own: a danger, affiliated with "fierce animals" yet irresistable to those neophyte sailors who all wanted something from her. The metaphor grows clearer in light of the earliest encounters in the region (well-documented in relation to Champlain, Capt. Thos. Hunt, Plimothers et al. in Carpenter), which were increasingly characterized by</page><page sequence="8">290 Early American Literature, Volume 34,1999 violence, kidnap, and "poisonous" liquors and disease, as Morton's Ameri can decade wore on. Morton's Scilla is also in keeping (and more) with Thomas Lodge's epyl lion about her at the Inns. For as Keach has shown, where Inns writers might have been expected to produce "frivolous" and "decadently Italian ate" poetic reactions against Petrarchan and neo-Christian valuations of Scilla's story (such as is found in Ovide Moralise), Lodge and others dis played "sensitivity to the violent pathos and psychic torment" in Scilla's mistreatment. Lodge's treatment, and Morton's after him, went beyond any simply-crude "parody of orthodox moralizing" (Keach 43, 50). This distinction fostering sensitivity was, Keach writes, Lodge's aim: his send up of the self-absorbed Glaucus was the "dig" he aimed at the Inns' very audience of "penny-knaves," with their cynical sexual mores. It is notable also that while in Lodge's telling Scilla sits at first coyly displaying her attractions before a gathered company, in "The Poem" she sits grieving and impassive, sick and silent except perhaps for her "plaint" taken up by others. Her emotions are the first things told of her; they originate in inde pendent events before the speaker's arrival; and her silence speaks, because we revelers/readers know the stories of Scilla and Niobe. "Oedipus" must discover the cosmic "reason" for her sufferings. Finally, we note other versions of Niobe's tale. For example, within Sophocles' Antigone, the latter heroine is told that, like Niobe, "your self sufficiency has brought you down"?and Niobe here is turned to stone after weeping for her lost children (lines 872-75, qtd. in Grant 213). In several sources available to Morton's generation, Niobe's final fate is as a statue that "still weeps" (primary texts listed in Graves 1-259). But these variants resonate not only with Morton's Renaissance. A half-morning's walk north of the site of Ma-re Mount in Quincy, facing the islands of Boston Bay at the very end of the peninsula called Squantum, stands Squa Rock, an imposing 35-foot high outcrop of dark gray puddingstone with an unmistakable likeness to a woman's high cheeked features. (Illustration in Dempsey's edition of Canaan-, or, you can follow the beach-side trail to the literal end of Squantum early in the day, before the waters rise high enough to obscure this "face" in the cliff.) A number of Native and other legends relate how this formation became known as "Weeping Rock" or "Squa Tumble," after a Native woman who "fell" into the sea there. The earliest meanings of Squantum itself, however, take us back to tales of the gigantic "Indian" couple, Maushop and Old Squant/Granny Squant (Crosby 35; Simmons, Spirit, passim). They say that Maushop (for several "reasons") devoured and/or transformed all their children; and that Granny Squant, in grief for them, was herself changed into a tearful stone beside the ocean. Morton did not miss the rock-formations called "Squanto's</page><page sequence="9">New English Canaan and The Riddle of May Day 291 Chapel" at Moswetusett near his home (noted earlier), and he cannot have missed Squa Rock so close to his plantation. Scilla-Niobe "is" America, its land and peoples: these are figured also in Canaan's "Author's Prologue" as attractive bride and widow grieving "fruitlessly" over a "tomb" that was her "womb" (Canaan 7).15 All this represents an unsurpassed inclusion of Native history and experi ence in four lines of early English-American poetry. These things, Ma-re Mount's "authors" tell us, happened before ("Till") the work of "Amphi trite's Darling" in the next line, who carried Scilla-Niobe's "plaint" to "Grim Neptune."16 He, in turn, filled New England's "bold shore" with "Protean forms" (multilingual fishermen, trappers and traders, lone plant ers, would-be missionaries, etc.), out of whose midst Scilla's "new para mour" had stepped when he "found" her sitting "solitary on the ground."17 And what does this learned counsel posted on the Maypole immediately say about the winning qualities needed ("to carry" America) by any hope ful New World paramour? Not surprisingly for poetic offspring of the Inns, this hero's strength must be his weakness. Samson, first, stands where one expects an example of power; but in Morton's words, the new American man must have "Samson's strength to deal with a Delilah" (136). In Mor ton's own day, Samson was most often an example of how not to behave in racial, religious, cultural, and marital affairs (Kermode 1396): the won derful irony behind this Biblical strongman is that he could not resist the women of Philistine and Canaanite races, who (like the Native Americans still in control of New England; Canaan 109) in ancient times had "do minion" over the landscape (Judges 13). Samson was a precariously rash and transgressive figure on the cultural frontier called Old Canaan, and he enjoyed the challenge of being "bound" and made vulnerable to Delilah, caring little that his elders disliked his choice in love ("she pleaseth me," he shrugs to them; Judges 14:3-4). Job, too, was then widely read and "performed" as a figure of "despair and impatience," rather than as a man who bore patiently with sufferings beyond his understanding (Lewalski 189). These were both "flawed pro tagonists" whose very imperfections were part of the "deliberate allegory" created among men by God, to serve his edifying ends in the world (Astell 179,189; this partly describes Milton's later Samson Agonistes as well). Each figure's "fall" was part of the show in morality plays, giving "fallen nature its due" by voicing (for example) Job's "What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is my end, that I should be patient?"?thus enlisting more powerfully the audience's "undisciplined" energies, for safe-return to "nor mative" standards of behavior. To wander was still to be headed home. A young planter of Morton's company, like him nominally Christian but without the will or compulsion to "fetch" over an English wife (and with a Native "lass" close by), therefore might feel encouraged to enjoy what</page><page sequence="10">292 Early American Literature, Volume 34,1999 Marcus called "a condition of happy ambiguity in which the license and lawlessness [sic] associated with [May] customs could be interpreted as submission to authority" (3).18 Hence too the happy moral ambiguity in the final phrase of the poem's first sentence: one is directed thus, by Fate / To comfort Scilla." "Comfort" ?"whatever form it may take between you," smiles Morton the trader and chief poet?is moral, appropriate, "heroic" action in such circumstances of mutual need. As "The Song" to follow agrees: "Nectar is a thing assigned / By the Deity's own mind / To cure the heart oppressed with grief...." Indeed, at this point in performance of "The Poem," the speaker (likely Morton as the highest-ranked" gentleman" present) emerges as "I," as if to demonstrate the way to complete this unfolding narrative, the poem's "cure" and its proclamatory "manifesto of Ma-re Mount." With a cere monious oath to Venus and Love itself, "Here" is made an emphatic choice or decision to "court" the New World. Yet, why is this important gesture rendered in terms of a "fool"? John "Scogan" was one of the best-known English court harlequins or fools, and of his many "squibs" the only one Morton refers to (136) was his clever evasion of a death-sentence from his king. Sentenced to hang, Scogan "failed" to find a gallows-tree to his "liking" (Adams lists several sources; Prince Society Canaan 278). This "fool" not only dared offend, but used a form of tradition, the last wish, to play up a pretense that he had a "choice" at all; and the fiction turned (his) death back into life. Mor ton and his audience knew that "Scogan's Choice" meant virtually none. Such a predicament amounted to about the same nothing as the average human being's will to deny, or resist, the almost-universal "destinies" of "marriage" (sex-relations of some kind) and "unjust death," represented by "hanging" or doom at the hands of overwhelming power, political, natu ral or other. (See Whiting 189 and Harvey 276 on this proverb quoted in Canaan's "gloss" to "The Poem"; consider that "where one settles down is also where one meets doom.") So, while there appear to be virtually no options for the "choice" re quired of Ma-re Mount's company, there is an enticement here, suggesting that by practicing "Scogan's" wit, one may elude any consequence of the social taboos being broken. But with the enticement, "The Poem" gives a warning, to embrace here and now what choice there is: it reminds readers then and now that each man (including Morton) had, no doubt, less attrac tive options back home than here, and that each stood relatively blessed with opportunity from the "Fate" and/or "Love" which had "directed" their lives to New England. It might seem foolish formality to insist on af firming one's American lot; but this could make all the difference in a life here. The soon-to-arrive poet of Andover, Anne Bradstreet, learned this, after feeling her "heart rise" at first sight of the "wilderness."19</page><page sequence="11">New English Canaan and The Riddle of May Day 29$ This choice and "cultural courting," however, must be performed "Though Scilla's sick." This line says many things; but note first that the poem's final sentence calls out suddenly for help?as if things may fail? to a third and "ultimate" (in the "pagan" world) healer, Asklepios. Virgil's Aeneas is an aspect (ironic and otherwise) of our poem's speaker, who at Ma-re Mount is trying, as Aeneas did, to organize a new "country" in humble circumstance. But here in New England the possible "new commu nity" is on the edge of doom from epidemic. Ma-re Mount reaches further into early Rome for help: "Aesculapius" and his cultus saved the capital in 292 B.C.E. (Kerenyi Asklepios 5-9; and he was thanked with a waterside temple on the Tiber). This anxious summons of a doctor was also to draw upon standard English mummers'-play tradition, by which, near the end of plays involving preChristian themes of death-and-rebirth, he was called to restore "dying" players (Arner 158; James 273-75; Thomas 72). We have seen Asklepios' appearance in Gesta Grayorum above, and in Morton's well-thumbed Cicero, Asklepios was one who "healed with his oratory, not medicine" (Cicero 159). If each indentured "paramour" fails to make Native American Scilla-Niobe recover and respond, warns "The Poem" (with refreshing candor for both a male and a colonizer), "His" New World "labor" will be as "lost" as this woman to the forces of mortality?to "the mould." She is "now to be taken up[,] or laid down" (Canaan 136). Scilla's final disposition either will or will not enable the poem's ultimate proclamation to become human action. But we see by now that Morton learned his lessons at the Inns. For "The Poem" enlists its audience with skillful appeals: now it "brings them to the edge" by voicing human anxi eties concerning the overwhelming forces of "doom," which all can "relate to" because "none can withstand." And, straight into this moment before the void comes an enjambment which, like "the nick of time," brings res urrection. "Doom" is met with "Citherea's Power"; and, via that tiny equating conjunction "Nor," "The Poem" yokes together death and desire. "None" can withstand either force. "Venus" is an equal power among the Parcae or "Fatal Sisters." And, though Death began this oration, now it is Venus (Love) "who points" to American land and peoples; and she speaks "with proclamation," whose fulfillment, in regular practice by this nascent com munity, will carry Ma-re Mount's peoples away from that edge of doom where they stand, and take their "narrative" into the future. Their own ac tions will (hopefully) embody an answer to this prayer and riddle. "Cure" will come in time, through annual "keeping" of "hollyday." Scilla-Niobe's "grief" can heal only by literally acting out the promise within most social ritual?that "life" will, somehow, go on. "The Poem" asks for "new" understanding and "points" the New World</page><page sequence="12">294 Early American Literature, Volume 34,1999 as the place where the twin inevitabilities of death and desire will join together in a powerful regenerative alchemy. There is no subtext of anxiety from what Bakhtin (432) called "official culture" that, as in Christian es chatology, these two "devouring" forces must lie down together as lion and lamb. Morton delivers their Ciceronian or ancient "pagan" circular configuration, as they were typically joined in philosophy and ritual in the temples of Cythera (see for example Pausanius 1:3, 23; Cicero recom mended "solace" rather than "solution" for the "problem" of death, in actions "partaking of a common humanitas"; qtd. in Lorch 78-80). Ma-re Mount's proclamation speaks from and to a cosmos that, like Native New England's, is not "just" but infinitely malleable to those with shamanistic skills. It is a cosmos of "brass," in Sir Philip Sidney's fa mous terms, but with plenty of "gold" available, in the form of pleasant year-round consolations to those with the skills to exploit them.20 It dic tates that, while none can resist either death or desire, one can build a human(e) community amidst them, via "hollyday"?what Catherine Alba nese termed the "balancing act" of nature-inclusive religious practices (23). In Anglican Church terms, "the body is where God communes with us, where we show our worship" (Blunt vii). Choices are made in organization of a community, and through custom and ritual each community signifies, to itself, to others, to the universe, its choices and historical identity. Ma re Mount, beginning with its 80-foot-high horns "as a fair sea-mark" to bring in people and the bulk of the traffic in American wealth (132), signed to its neighbors in the vocabularies of seasonal rhythm, market-town eco nomic intercourse, and trade-sustaining human relations. There were consequences for Native Americans in this trade and poetry, however, that must be recognized. Most invasively, "The Poem" and the Revels themselves carry on "Though Scilla's sick." Indeed, as with Canaan's early remark that the epidemic "angel of the Lord" had made the land "more fit" for the English, "The Poem" and Revel capitalize in every sense on Native New England's human devastation. Scilla will be courted by these English, whether or not "she" (her desired community of fur-traders and "marriageable" women) understands what these "paramours" are say ing with their words and dances. And they will "court" her at a time of grief she suffers partly because there is a supposed lack of "virtue mascu line" in these still-populous Native American surroundings. The last verse of "The Song" to follow the solemnities of "The Poem," with its more ac cessible round-dances, performs this colonization in an erotic cajoling of Native daughters for the sake of their wealth, as it calls for "Lasses" to fol low their own warm-weather custom (Wilbur 83) and remove upper-body wraps, especially of course their "beaver coats." The "humane virtues" and "fair means" are as integral to "The Poem" as its "sins," because they perform the "cultural work" of extending "His</page><page sequence="13">New English Canaan and The Riddle of May Day 295 Majesty's Empire" and Native American subjection. But Morton's central metaphor of a "widow" for Native American land and peoples, an almost singular metaphor in colonial texts, suggests the loss of Native men rather than their fictive and convenient absence, as it "courts" Scilla-Niobe. For the phrase "virtue masculine" has something more cosmic than biological about it, more of the medieval apothecary or alchemical formula (as "The Song" does with its line, "This physic will soon revive his bloud"?his race and his "melancholy" humor). Reading Morton's syntax carefully, we see that what keeps Scilla "sick," what keeps her from any hope of a future amid the wreckage of all she has known, is not, at last, the lack of a male at all. "It" is specified as a "sign." Scilla remains silent, unable to answer "Sco gan's choice," because she has been crushed by the apparent failure of her civilization and its apparently displaced system of "signs" of mean ing, perspective, and understanding, and by the failure of every traditional healing-practice that Native peoples must have tried to save themselves. Scilla's cosmos, once assumed fundamentally hospitable (Speck, Penobscot Man 311), has rendered no cure, no countersign to the ritual appeals made by shamans, sages-femmes, and broken circles of Native kin relations. Morton's culture knew as little about "plague" as its American hosts. But in that void ripped open in Native reality, Ma-re Mount would place not simply its own Transcendental Signifier (the phallic "speaking" May pole), but the entire Revel itself and its energies: "The Poem" and "Song" are three-dimensional speakings, performance-texts whose characters are living bodies; and they are moved by multiform American desires (for profit, freedom, eros). The Revel itself is the company's improvised offer ing of European "medicine," the best collective means for regeneration of the "tribe" through whom they want to get rich. There is no question of the company's imperialist motive: there is room for new critical and historical appraisal of all aspects here. For Cronon, Morton was "almost alone" (80) in grasping the Native sense of living "richly"; Goldberg (65) remarked the "egalitarian" cultural mixture here; and for Jennings (Invasion) the "widow" image alone was extraordinary. Ma-re Mount was in a contest with Plimoth for the New England fur trade, and used ritual itself as "a present act which historically recalls the past for the purpose of reordering?even predetermining?the future" (Cope 170). Where the intrusive aspect of that "Though" in "The Poem" regis ters the colonialist project, an anthropologist of ritual like Victor Turner would simultaneously observe a rather typical "forcible aspect" noted in most rites that must call for a break with the past (202). Most importantly on this point, "The Poem" does not "act" as if Scilla has cooperated automatically; but ends with a warning and a hope for shared renewal. Constructed out of the interdependence of both trading</page><page sequence="14">296 Early American Literature, Volume 34,1999 partners and of male/female, it plights a public "troth," to move "her" toward speech. The Revels are, and call for from Scilla, a language and speech of connection rather than of lack: what one writer has under stood in our own time as "acceptance," "of the irrevocability of absence by putting ... death into words" (Wyatt 477). Only if Scilla responds can the Revels achieve the opposite of a simple imperialist ventriloquism. It is an act more grave than, but not unlike, one of Wampanoag Sachem Ousamequin's, when he wondered to his Pilgrim guests that their King James "would live without a wife" (Mourt 66). The Revels, responding to and/or "reading in" the same "predicament," present the same question to a person understood to be suffering. The early trade that followed inevitable contact was not so different from previous relations of trade that prevailed on both sides before con tact, amongst the "races" or nations of Europe and those of America. Cohabitation, sex relations, intermarriage, and seasonal rituals were all employed to smooth over the constant contests and offense-expiations that make up human intercourse; and these were salted everywhere with profit and fighting, cheating, dancing, murder, reconciliation, and reveling. In early-colonial New England these helped the Ma-re Mount company over the resentments they inevitably roused in Native peoples for their intru sion into the land and its power relations. Perhaps the only Ma-re Mount distinction in Native eyes might be its lack of a programmatically applied racial discrimination.21 At Ma-re Mount the typical early New England "rule" had been pleasure expedient to short-term profit?the "haste" Lesear bot described above? and also produced the same imagery in French histories, of health and medicine found in shared activities.22 A later colonial phase more charac terized by outright violent conquest departed from these early forms of "gradualism" ("bringing them to civility"), such as Hariot spoke for in Virginia. The Dutch, treating for New Amsterdam trade through Algon quian Canarsee "daughters" (see Capt. de Vries' Historiae qtd. in Raesly 174), also came to scorn syncretism and intermarital methods, as did the French by the 1700s (Dickason 277). But as we study the poetry at the center of "The Revels of New Canaan" we cannot discount the cultural reaching-out to Native peoples that was part of the Ma-re Mount colony. Young New England missionary Thomas Mayhew, fourteen years after Morton, saw likewise on Martha's Vine yard "that a way to gain the confidence and respect of the Indians, and so further settlement by the English, was to compete with the powwows, as they competed with one another, as healers" (Mavor and Dix 157).23 Many sources on just the visible, structuring aspects of Native public ceremonies suggest a Ma-re Mount attempt to connect with those traditions. A shaman or powah healed people through a ritual acting-out of prob</page><page sequence="15">New English Canaan and The Riddle of May Day , 297 lems to envision, diagnose, and remedy those problems with the group's participation. The aim was a ritual, sometimes including the use of nar ratives,24 which "dramatized" the fact of sickness, the powah's power to heal it, and the cure of the patient whose "energies" had hopefully been thus galvanized. Music, dance, call-and-response?"These do begin and order their service and Invocation of the Gods, and all the people follow, and joyne interchangeably in a laborious bodily service," Williams ob served (189-92). Winslow described "arbors" or "bowers" of rushes raised at Native ceremonial places "as Apollo and Diana had temples" (583-84; see also Bragdon, Peoples 219). Wood wrote that "all the auditors" of the powah's performance "with one voice utter[ed] a short canto," a sound "like a quire" to Williams (192). There were also, his Key added con sistently with Canaan, other kinds of "Solemne speeches and Orations," "Lectures . . . concerning Religion, Peace, or Warre and all things," heard "sometimes" by "neere a thousand." Surely all these cultural forms (includ ing the transatlantic art of round-dancing, to follow here with Morton's lyric "Song") were deliberately blurred together within the shared desire for trade between Ma-re Mount and Native New England. What, however, could Morton have hoped to accomplish later with his "Revels of New Canaan" chapter, when these events had brought about his second (thirteen-year) exile from New England? How could En glish readers who lacked Ma-re Mount's frontier experience comprehend "Scilla/Niobe's" plight and Canaan's proclamation of the way to Ameri can prosperity? Morton's life (C.1576-C.1647) spanned the most intense period of Puritan "cultural reform," including strident arguments for and against "sports" and the traditional pastimes of "old England," such as Maypoles and dances on the green. Morton the lawyer, driven back to England in 1630, re solved to avenge his burned plantation, and did so by merging his own legal complaints with those of Sir Ferdinando Gorges and others against the Puritan charter to New England. By 1635 Gorges, the Council for New En gland's mostly "Cavalier" courtiers and aristocrats, the future Archbishop of Canterbury William Laud, and ultimately King Charles I, would revoke all Puritan powers to govern the Northeastern frontier. But it was Thomas Morton's petitions, witness-affidavits, and legwork in service of Gorges's private ambitions that kept the process going despite early setbacks. New England Puritans like Winthrop (2:194) were l?ng aware of a petition "of many pages" in Morton's hands, which likely evolved through legal pro cess into his 1635 cluo tvarranto document (the "curtain call" against New England's government; rpt. in Hutchinson 101); and charges therein read like echoes of pages in Canaan. Most basically, then, "Revels of New Canaan" appropriated the ongoing cultural battle over "sports" to help at least the devoted Elizabethans and</page><page sequence="16">298 Early American Literature, Volume 34,1999 Neoplatonists of his courtly audience to perceive the merits of Gorges's legal suit. But surely, only the most leisured and astute English readers had even a chance to puzzle out the tenor of Niobe's "plaint." Given Mor ton's own fate, however, we should not wonder that he so thickly veiled what Gorges had called the "discreet measures" needed to prosper by "fair means" in and with Native New Englanders. Loren Pennington's and other surveys have shown that English colonial writings of the 1630 s, in the wake of the 1620s Virginia "massacres" and costly wars, saw a thoroughly angry reversal of most early optimism and hopeful toleration expressed toward Native Americans. By now John Smith and others had come to ex plicitly approve the open conquest of Native "infidels" who (like peoples of the Caribbean) resisted European plans. While there can be no doubt that Canaan "complicated" these brutally ethnocentric simplicities born of colonial frustrations, its most radical counter-suggestions were just too hidden in literary camouflage to be effective. To at least some degree we must conclude that, like "The Song" that both respects and colonizes the Native American "lass," Canaan tries to have it both ways. Readers who could track Morton's sophistications were likely already "his kind" of planter, but the book's broad endorsements to colonizers helped along a less thoughtful juggernaut.25 Still, Canaan is replete with evidence that Morton took subtle steps about these quandaries. May Day itself proceeded from "The Poem's" oracu lar language to the more accessible "misteries" of drink and hand-holding dance. Canaan's arguments have a similar form. Book 1 is "high style": its first paragraph locates New England cosmologically as "The wise Cre ator's" own best "glasse" in which Englishmen can practice the virtues of "moderation, and discretion" (8). And its portrait of Native New England implies at each end (chapters 2 and 20) that English and Native American are born of the same racial stock (18), and that both at their best strive for the same "Plato's Commonwealth" (49). Book 2's commercial catalogue of "commodities" is laced with a potent counter-theme encouraging modera tion: its own infectious feeling for the land (51, 87, 90), its living creatures, its robust airs. If these cannot educate a colonist toward "comply[ing] with" American realities, Morton offers at last the How-Not-To-Colonize Manual of Book 3's wide-open comedy, which begins with Native Ameri can point of view and with Plimothers' amazement that a Native man can speak English. It proceeds to dissect the "quondam drummer" Cap tain Shrimp (Plimoth's man-at-arms Myles Standish) and the stern bungler Captain Littleworth (John Endicott, mocked as a "fiddler" by "the illiter ate multitude") and to offer a thorough critique of not just "Separatist" but "Christian" misguidedness. It further rewards with the un-Quixotic misadventures of that priceless prince of ethnocentric paranoia, the anony mous "Master Bubble."</page><page sequence="17">New English Canaan and The Riddle of May Day 299 Morton's multicultural short story concerns a would-be "great mer chant" ("Bubble" was a former would-be minister) who refuses to learn any Native language, and so ends up botching an inland trade-journey for beaver. To the surprise of his Native hosts (whose actions he has somehow "misapplied"), Bubble bolts in needless terror into the woods at night with his pants on over his head.26 And to the Native men's terror after a care ful debate of their own (that tries to take the bright view of the English!), Bubble's "sober" English colleagues reason their way to exactly the wrong idea of where the fault lies. As a result they threaten to kill Native "wifes and children" unless the guides fetch Bubble back. They rescue Bubble: he never has an inkling of what caused all this tumult (himself), and the very weight of such a climax of nonperception lands squarely in the reader's lap. Like America, Canaan is filled with a speaking Native American pres ence and, as in "The Poem," it waits on many levels for those who can or will "Rise Oedipus." If the number of such readers was few enough, Sternberg's discovery of a minor Morton document tells us that, somehow, most copies of Canaan were mistakenly confiscated and destroyed?mistaken for subver sive foreign-printed tracts?by Morton's own government masters. The rest were reviled for most of 350 years and more. But, as we begin to read Morton on his own terms, and perceive his multifaceted address to the ethics of the colonial reader, we begin to wonder how much more one man could have done to promote not only the most practical, but also the most humane, approach to that indeed-inhabited country signified by his title page: New Canaan. NOTES i. More than 30 such sources are cited in "A Sampler of Remarks" on Thomas Morton in New English Canaan published by this editor (note below). They can be said to begin with Wm. Bradford's History, and include Winslow, Winthrop, Dudley, and Nathaniel Morton, and their views of Morton are echoed in detail through even the encyclopedias of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. One of the first major editors of "American Literature," Moses Coit Tyler, was a Congrega tional minister; like critic/historian John Gorham Palfrey, who reproduces William Bradford's entire version of the Plimoth/Ma-re Mount conflict, and ferociously at tacks the very idea of Native "civilizations" (1: 232 for example). Contemporary literary historian Nina Baym found that Tyler's influential works were "followed because he was himself a follower"; and Baym agrees with many views of Tyler, as the early-definitive editor of what was deemed, by minister, secular ideologue, and book-publisher alike, as "fit to read" in American classrooms. None of Tyler's works suggest that New English Canaan had ever been written. New England his torians led by C.F. Adams, Jr., including Francis Parkman, Jonathan Trumbull, and Worthington C. Ford, also denounced Morton and Canaan in their various early American editions. These are strong lines of agreement across the American-critical ages. What other early American text has been received this way?</page><page sequence="18">300 Early American Literature, Volume 34,1999 Unless otherwise indicated, all page numbers herein refer to New English Canaan by Thomas Morton of "Merrymount" edited by myself (this text of Canaan based on a full collation of all extant copies and annotated as part of my Ph.D. dissertation at Brown University). 2. The charges against Morton are not "legal" ones but derive from Bradford's History (2: 52), his Letters (56-64 to the Council for New England), and Winslow's 1635 accusation in a "Petition" (1635: Mass. Hist. Soc. Procs. 5:133). Though there is no record of a hostile act by a Native New Englander with a gun from Morton or any other trader between 1624 and 1630, a recent example of the continuing "con viction" standing against Morton and, more importantly, against Native peoples, is Vaughan's New England Frontier (89-90), which invokes C. F. Adams, Jr.'s hostile 1883 edition and study of Canaan in order to reaffirm the prevailing view of "the Morton affair." The view has been that, while the Puritans of Plimoth supposedly would have been glad to leave Morton alone on the landscape (which they knew they did not legally govern), all the early Massachusetts planters did have "cause for apprehen sion" from the "poor [Native] survivors" of the "plague" to whom Morton traded guns. Hence Plimoth's duty to behave "responsibly" as the sole party in the re gion capable of "interracial diplomacy" (Vaughan's phrase for keeping guns solely in European hands), "while behind the impenetrable veil of the forest," he adds, "were [also] the dreaded Narragansetts"?the peoples of what James Axtell has ironically called "darkest Connecticut!:." 3. Bradford centered his rival's misdeeds round a "May-pole," Ford ed., Brad ford History 2: 48; and Morton dubbed "revels" a number of different Native social gatherings, from healings to feasts to marriages (22, 29, 32 for examples). 4. A host of tiny clues examined in Thomas Morton shows that Morton's likely birth-year of 1576 probably placed him at the Inns in his late teens roughly from 1593 to 1600 (normal tenure was about seven years). No documents prove he was an actual attorney but he did legally bring about revocation of New England's char ter in the 1630s. 5. The focus of the entire program, as of Morton's "Poem" (below), was a woman, here in the person of Queen Elizabeth. Given her years of lavish court spectacles such as at Kenilworth, she was impressed by the "Proteus" performance so that, when the "lesser courtiers" joined the players to dance, she exclaimed "What! Shall we have bread and cheese after a banquet?" (Gesta 49). 6. The concept of intermarriage as the most advisable way for Europeans to colo nize America was old by this time. Many documents in the collection Early Images of the Americas (Williams and Lewis, eds., 1993) testify that the English (such as Sir Thomas More with his Utopia) kept abreast of ideas such as those of the early Spanish colonizer Las Casas; who, in a memorial de remedios ("brief of appeals") to the Spanish Crown, proposed a plan for the creation of colonies/communities where "Indians" and "ennobled" Spanish "peasants" were to intermarry and share the coast of "Cumana" (now Venezuela). At the opposite end of Europe, Scots man Sir William Alexander praised John Rolfe's marriage to Virginia's Pocahontas because he believed that "by admitting equality" one might help to "remove con tempt" from the attitudes of some English (qtd. in Kupperman 104). Morton was a latecomer to Spanish, French, English and Dutch colonial methods practiced across the first 100 years of transatlantic contact. Jennings (Founders 347-52) provides an overview of intermarriage as a substantial part of early and later Native-European trade (though least practiced among the English). In his view, so-called metis com munities directly descended from these practices suggest the very real and different</page><page sequence="19">New English Canaan and The Riddle of May Day 301 possible outcome(s) of an "alternative" colonial method or policy. To Nicholas Canny, English lack of experience outside the pales in Ireland helped colonists to "believe" racist stereotypes in favor of imperialism; and even so, many "went [Irish] native" by intermarriage (or less formal arrangements) until the application of military discipline there. This was also the case in early Spanish Florida, where colonizers married into Calusa and Arawak matrilinies and made more cultural "adaptations" thereby than Native people did (Deagan 305). 7. Morton writes that these poetic works were "performed" (133), including such signs of significant organization as a "Chorus"; and Bradford's account of these ac tivities by "all the scum of the country" (Ford ed., Bradford History 2: 77) at least agrees that the poetry was made quite "public." Scottow ("Narrative" 1629: 289) wrote that servant Edward Gibbons had some experience of letters, being only "divinely illiterate." It will appear that Native Americans present could have com prehended the poems. They were at least half of the most crucial audience being addressed. 8. Morton both follows and departs from usages (including the mythical Niobe and Proteus) in Edmund Spenser's Shepheardes Calendar (1579) and Faerie Queene (1590s). Like Spenser, Morton's impulse is to both "make a poem" and "persuade and move" people toward his idea of a "virtuous and gentle discipline," and con siders it "So much more profitable and gratious" to present "doctrine by ensample, [rather than] by rule" (Spenser qtd. in Maclean 427, 2). Where they chiefly differ is on the nature of "Proteus" in human nature and best interests. For Spenser he is "father of false prophecies" (FQ III, viii) and, as in Boccaccio's influential De Ge nealog?a Deorum, symbol of a "changefulness" associated "with forces opposed to order and harmonious unity" (Maclean 297). The reader can easily compare Mor ton's. 9. These Revels' most obvious appropriation of tradition to attract/engage with New Englanders is of course the "fertility rite" aspect of May Day tradition. Marcus (2): "May Day had been an official feast day of the Catholic and Anglican churches. It carried associations of fertility [healthy increase of children, crops and livestock], renewal, frolicks in the greenwood, and restored community." Thomas (61, 65) elucidates the English sense of "fertility rite" within folk-customs: the term has been a familiar one in existing Morton studies, beginning with Bradford's liken ing these Revels to the "beastly practices of the mad Bacchanalians" celebrating the "Roman Goddess Flora" (History 2-48). Marcus lists a wealth of Renaissance texts (pro-sports and con) linking these agriculture-centered customs back to Classical and pagan-European cultural sources. Adams's 1883 Canaan adopted the Puritan critique of them (18) found in Phillip Stubbes's 1583 Anatomie of Abuses, while Slotkin, Zuckerman, and Shea have each explored some concerns listed above. It would have been easy, useful, and important to a central reason for the Revels, for a person with a few Eastern Algonquian words at his command to relate what was "in the attempt" of these various "speech acts" within "The Poem." Citations below and easily available will show Native New Englanders practicing and inter ested in such actions (of religious, political and other function) performed upon significant land-forms such as this hill. For examples and overviews see Bragdon " 'Emphaticall Speech,' " and Mavor and Dix's 1991 Manitou: The Sacred Land scape of New England's Native Civilization 160-61. The latter and Vastokas' Sacred Art of the Algonkians (1973:107, passim) have collated numerous archaeological and other evidences of marked "fertility" and erotic "concerns" (among many others) in Eastern Algonquian artifacts, from petroglyphs to the many unmistakably phallic "effigy pestles" in Massachusetts Archaeological Society (Middleboro) and private</page><page sequence="20">302 Early American Literature, Volume 34,1999 collections: Wampanoag historian Great Moose/Russell Gardiner will also publish a detailed illustrated study of these in the Massachusetts Archaeological Society Bul letin in 1999. The careful anatomical detail in these "grinding tools" is obvious, and one example dates from a Paleolithic (and preagr?cultural) site at Squibnocket (Martha's Vineyard) c. 6000-4000 B.C.E. Fruitlands Museum (Harvard, Mass.) has also exhibited a small stone "fertility figurine" discovered in southern Con necticutt. 10. The other obvious way to read Oedipus might be as a figure of parri cide/incest; though how that would mesh with all the other figures in "The Poem" in a reasonable coherence of meaning (granting Morton intelligence), or in consis tency with historical and other contexts, remains to be shown. On "the mould" and "Chary bdis" as death: Morton was apparently told by Native New England ers that, in their cosmology, at least some deceased or "destroyed" human beings "went to Sanaconquam, who feeds upon them," and as he heard this his informants were "pointing to the Center of the Earth" (42). Chary bdis was a mid-ocean whirl pool avoided by Odysseus's ship (but not by others') in Homer's Odyssey. 11. The word "solitary" is a first identification of this woman with a natural and a human landscape. See the Bible's Jeremiah, Lamentations (1:1): "How the city doth sit solitary, that was full of people! How is she become a widow!" 12. Many recent population estimates are reviewed in Salisbury (36) and Brag don (People 25). On what disease these "plagues" were, see Spiess and Spiess; for many specific reasons Cronon (87) suggests not bubonic plague but chicken pox. In any case, Higginson (1630: in Force 2:16) agreed with Bradford (History 2: 208) that epidemic had left scarcely "one in a hundred" Native New England people alive by about 1620. A number of textual sources, besides long-standing oral traditions shared with this writer by numerous living Native scholars, agree that a matrilineal and/or matrifocal social structure was the rule in Morton's southern New England. Sources include Salisbury's and Bragdon's careful studies of primary evidences as well as those by Grumet, Etienne and Leacock, Simmons ("Narragansett" and Spirit), Sal wen (170), Allen (30-42), and Leland. The oldest-known limestone carving found in the region, too (now in Harvard's Peabody Museum) represents a mother with a child on her back (Davis 2-5) and "probably served as some sort of ceremonial object." The "Great Squa Sachem" mentioned in Canaan (128) had powers real enough to bestow upon her three land-granting "Sachem" sons in the 1620S-30S: Morton's one sample of Native oratory was Chikatawbak's anger over desecration of his mother's grave (Canaan 107); and before Morton, William MorrelPs poem New-England described Native women as important go-betweens among feuding tribal groups. Typically, Morrell wrote, their methods of diplomacy led to inter marriage ("Hymen" was his word for this, and it was Morton's too in "The Song" that followed performance of "The Poem"). 13. "Wherever I turn my eyes, everywhere throughout my home, I see unlimited wealth. Moreover, I am as beautiful as any goddess. Add to all this my seven sons and seven daughters.... Can you still ask what cause I have for pride?" (Metamor phoses 6:139) 14. It is integral to "The Poem" that this mortal woman Scilla-Niobe's triple aspect as nymph, mother and widow corresponds to the poem's three invocations of the Goddess of Love Venus/Aphrodite?as "Amphitrite's Darling" (nymph), "Cupid's . . . mother," and as an aspect of The Parcae or "Fatal Sisters." Such a divine-mortal linkage is carried further in "The Song" with its invitation to share in "Nectar."</page><page sequence="21">New English Canaan and The Riddle of May Day 303 15. According to Horner (i), the word Squantum is "derived from Musquantum, a place of awesome significance now known as Squantum Head. ... In 1635 the prefix Mu was dropped, at least from the recording of the land deeds": Horner continues that Native residents there told of "a most awesome male/female spirit" by that name. In Higginson (13) Squantum is "their evill god." For other possible influences on Morton's imagery here, see the "Ditchley" por trait of Queen Elizabeth, shown standing upon/identified with (a map of) England; and the Belphoebe-like Native figure on John Smith's 1612 map of Virginia (rpt. in Arber), both pointed out to me by Paul Caton of Brown University. A visual identification of Scilla with a seaside standing rock appears in Keach (41): this is de Glauco from Nicholas Reusner's Picta Poesis Ovidiana (Frankfort 1580), one of many influential "mythological handbooks" circulating at the Inns. That Morton was influenced by such manuals will further appear below. He also seems repeat edly taken with widowed or grieving women: witness his brief marriage to widow Alice Miller (documents in Banks) and his "curative" writings on and to the melan choly "Barren Doe of Virginia." Given strong clues that Morton came from West Country Devonshire, he may have been interested by peculiar and historic land-forms, Devon itself being thick with them, from Neolithic barrow-tomb petroglyphs to the markers left by Ves pasian's 2nd Roman Legion (Hoskins 9; Whitlockio6; Fox, chaps. 1, 2, 7). Sachem Chikatawbak's Neponsets moved to Squantum (Moswetusett Hummock) just as Morton arrived on "Boston Bay," and may well have shown their new trade-partner around. Long exposure to such non-English landforms and pre-English cultural ideas would help a man of the Renaissance to appreciate the same things in his New Canaan neighborhood. 16. "Amphitrite's Darling" is Roman poet Virgil's nickname for the sea-born Goddess of Love, Venus/Aphrodite (Aeneid, book 5; Arner 161), who was attended by many sea-nymphs such as Amphitrite. In the same verse-chapter Venus is also dubbed "Citherea" after the Greek island long-known for her worship. "Venus" as a synonym/signifier for "Love" Morton may have borrowed from (among hun dreds of sources since Classical times) Spenser's 1595 Colin Clout's Come Home Again: other examples of this equation follow. "Neptune" was the force forbidding, then allowing (thanks to Venus) the hero Aeneas to reach his intermarital, nation-founding destiny in the new-found-land of Italy (Aeneid, Book 5). For Morton Neptune may signify James I, figured thus in Ben Jonson's unperformed 1624 masque Neptune's Triumph for the Return of Albion (in which a "Proteus" and other characters "solicit the ladies" with "strange ob session"; Fumerton 169). Or Neptune may be Morton's more immediate colonial employer Sir Ferdinando Gorges, who also "filled" the seas with ships before Mor ton's Unity in 1624; and whose Council for New England built a vessel for Gorges' use called The Great Neptune in the 1630s (Preston 247-48). "Triton" was a benign seahorse-like "river god" and herald of Greek sea-king Poseidon (the Roman Neptune; see Graves 1-44, 59). In New France planter Marc Lescarbot's 1606 Theatre of Neptune, the boat bearing his masque's main charac ter is drawn by "six tritons" with "trumpets" (Richardson 17,19). Grafton (64) reprints a woodcut showing Triton in Johannes Galle 's Speculum diversarum imagi num speculativarum (Antwerp 1638); which in turn represents Columbus on a ship surrounded by such fish-tailed beings, themselves much like the Glaucus-figure in Keach (41) noted above. In "The Poem" Triton seems a reference to the numer ous musters of Devonshire men wanted for service in American enterprises, since the 1580s days of Sir Humphrey Gilbert. Details of Morton's exit to America out</page><page sequence="22">304 Early American Literature, Volume 34,1999 of his 1622-24 legal embroilments are presented in chapter 4 of Dempsey, Thomas Morton (biography). Robert Graves's Greek Myths remains the best reference work on the subject, with its lucid listings of primary-textual variants for each myth and their histori cal and other contexts. For every mythological figure used in Morton's "Poem" and "read" in these pages, I have taken primary-source variants and Renaissance handbooks into account including Charles Stephanus' popular 1553 Dictionarium Historicam, Starnes and Talbot's Classical Myth and Legend in Renaissance Dictio naries, Ovid moralise, Tottell's 1557 Miscellany, Natales Comes, works by Boccaccio, and the broad selection of handbooks in Kermode. 17. As Canaan notes (51), Native New England funereal customs included fre quent grave-visitations in which relatives would "lament and bewail" their losses. As this was a practice no doubt too common in the epidemics of the 1610S-1620S, the poem's "finding" of Scilla-Niobe may refer to an actual event between Mor ton's company and a "solitary" Native woman. John Winthrop met one (and had a very different response) while lost near his Boston Bay house (Journal 1-68). 18. Of course a different reading is possible: Job's story does conclude with a humbling divine epiphany that restores his "health and household" (Astell 2): Sam son's suicidal destruction of the Philistines' temple helps to purge the landscape of "pagan" cultural rivals, and this is consistent with Morton's remarks on New En gland's epidemics being good for colonists' purposes. But as Morton told "Pilgrim" readers (134), we must not read only "a part" of "The Poem." Construe Samson, then, as an exemplary killer of heathens for God's purposes, or as a mock-heroic "anti-Puritan" who slays those "philistines" with the jawbone of a "fool." And/or read Job here as a man whose deepest faith takes him past the afflictions (boils, etc.) that defeat others, and confirms his "chosen" status. But how can such readings co here with the rest o/"The Poem"? The undecidability of Samson and Job?the only two JudeoChristian signifiers in the poem except for Scogan the fool?makes them yet another invitation to wander or experiment, especially on a frontier with virtu ally no authorities either to reward conformity or enforce it. Neither of the two Ma re Mount servants known historically displayed enthusiasm for either Puritanism or Christianity. Walter Bagnall definitely lit out for the "ungodly" territories of Sir Ferdinando Gorges' Maine (see Winthrop's Journal), while the better-documented Edward Gibbon became a merchant of no great ethical repute in Puritan Boston (his career summarized in Hale 238). Ma-re Mount's other servants (between five and seven men at least) remain what European-style records call "unaccounted for." 19. The "Padstow Mayers' Song" from seventeenth-century West Country Corn wall also chided celebrants to make their choices, by mention of the grave ("whither we are going") in the midst of their dance: "Unite and unite . . . For summer is a-comin' . . . And whither we are going, we all will unite. . , ." Welsford details long European traditions of the court fool's dances and struggles with Death, such as those of "Pauvre Pierrot" after a wave of epidemic: "Enfin voila le cholera . . . Bim-Boum, Zoum-Zim. Toujours comme ca" (387). "He makes love to a rose by moonlight, and the moon has the face of a skull." . With final regard to the benefits of "choosing one's fate," Morton was familiar with Horace's Satires; and an Italian folktale behind Horace's "II" (line 6) refers to a peasant laborer in his fields, who asks Hercules' help in improving his life. Her cules brings the man before the wealth-sawy god Mercury, who promises to help the man find "buried treasure"; and when the man agrees, he finds himself back in his field with the same work ("planting") before him. 20. Connors 78. "Morton's implied comparison [Canaan 51-52] of a real coun</page><page sequence="23">New English Canaan and The Riddle of May Day 305 try" to Sidney's "golden ideal" world "is not altogether farfetched: it seems to be an example of what Tillyard would call an 'Elizabethan hovering between equiva lence and metaphor,' (an instance of 'equivalences shaded off into resemblances')." All of which goes to say that Morton was suggesting America as about the closest thing to a paradise one might realistically expect. 2i. See Shurtleff, ed., Records of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, whose courts in March 1631 (not long after Morton's 2nd exile) ordered "all persons who had Indian servants ... to discharge them by May 1," and that "none" should thereafter "take Indians into their households without permission of the Court" (1-83). In his appeals for Council support against rival "irregular" traders, Governor Bradford of Plimoth offered to increase profits by trying to stop "the unprofitable consuming of the victuals of the land" by "these salvages" (1628; Letters 56). 22. "We spent this winter very pleasantly, and fared generously by means of the Ordre de Bon Temps, which I introduced. This all found useful for their health, and more advantageous than all the medicines that could have been used" (Champlain C.1604-7; Voyages no). See the same "health/medicine" metaphor in his compan ion Lescarbot's New France bk. IV, chap. 16. Huron peoples also devastated by epidemics understood enough of Champlain's offer of French-Huron intermarriage in order to reject it (Thwaites 5: 211,14:17 21). Native contexts do put English "ritual behavior" in interesting light. Dozens of Renaissance scholars write of masques and court-revels as above all concerned with making "subjects" (in every sense) of their participants. Native New Englanders were not without forms of "subjection" correlating with material and other status (Simmons "Shamanism"). But they must have looked wonderingly at rituals that deployed every kind of normally-restricted pleasure (haute cuisine, music, dance, magic, "emblems," drama, eroticism etc.) in order to invest "leaders"?by illusion, confusion, transference?with powers that meant increased subjection and impov erishment. (Lavish masques bankrupted aristocratic England toward Civil War.) At another ritual the Mohawk reacted thus: "When we pray they laugh at us. . . . and ... ask me what I am doing and what I want, that I stand there alone and make so many words, while none of the rest may speak...." (Rev. J. Megapolensis, 1644: rpt. in Jameson 175-180). 23. Scholars of Northeast Native American cultures including Frank G. Speck, Elisabeth Tooker, Bruce Trigger and William S. Simmons have shown both variety and "great conformity" in the religious and shamanistic practices of the region (Speck, "Penobscot Shamanism" 242): they and others (Fogelson, Hallowell Con juring, Vogel, Wallace) also provide useful detail on the varieties of shamans/ "powahs," their purposes and practices. Some healers specialized in herbal medi cine: compare with Gesta's and Ma-re Mount's distribution of "Nectar" to heal ailments listed in their respective "Song[s]." A second kind of powah organized and conducted rituals centered on magical counter-spells, dancing, and audience interactions (Heidenreich 373), and a third variety cured via the interpretation of dreams. The two principal acts in all were diagnosis and treatment. Speck's de scription of a powah's "penetration in a dream vision" to the "spiritual forces" that underlay a material condition (260) was not far from early Europe's "Asklepian" school rooted in Bronze Age magic/medicine. Winslow's Good News (583), Wil liams' Key (128), and Wood's Prospect (101) supply primary observations on these Native New England practices. 24. These might include retellings of myths, recountings of tribe-historical acts or achievements by other healers, or a use of short "anecdotes" that communicated healing-helpful incidents of "common people" using magic powers. Not only an</page><page sequence="24">3o6 Early American Literature, Volume 34,1999 attempt to "raise healing energies," this constituted an analytical use of language (as opposed to trance-inducing "vocables"), which could help to identify sources of disease related to breach of taboo, or to behavior or ethical issues. Broader con texts: studies by Toelken and Zolbrod in Swann, ed., Recovering the Word. The former shows how, in Navajo tradition, "words and narratives have the power to heal" (396), while Zolbrod studies Western "chantway" customs, in which ritu als/narratives "merge" patient with myth-protagonist, the former thereby "taking up quest" for cure. 25. Morton stood his Inns of Court "pastoral realism" against what he called the Puritan/New Israelites' "Martialist" approach to America (Canaan 152,194; also charged in clause 13 of his quo warranto). As a trained outdoorsman he parodied the nascent ideology of "wilderness" that solidified cultural boundaries round the Christian-capitalist labor camps of Virginia and Plimoth (the former under martial law and the latter with curfews and a "needless watchhouse," 115). He also quali fied his remark that Native decimation by "plague" was a sign of God's favor upon the English (20); but with a tiny marginal gloss alluding to "2 Sam. 24." Potent as this was ("These sheep, what have they done? Let Thine Hand ... be against me, and against my father's house"), it likely counted for little with most readers against the literally "larger" message on the page. 26. Perhaps another reason for professionally struggling pedagogue Moses Coit Tyler to leave Canaan utterly out of his literary-historical picture. WORKS CITED Adams, Charles Francis, Jr., ed.
