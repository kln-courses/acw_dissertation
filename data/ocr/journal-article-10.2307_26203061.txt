<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> MICHAEL J. HARRIS “But Now My Eye Has Seen  You”: Yissurin Shel Ahavah   as Divine Intimacy Theodicy  1. Introduction How do approaches in Jewish thought and tradition to the prob-lem of evil or suffering compare with the various positions adopted in contemporary philosophy of religion?1 To respond  comprehensively to this question, one would have to consider the whole  chronological range of relevant Jewish sources, from the biblical and  1. Eleonore Stump (Wandering in Darkness: Narrative and the Problem of Suffering  [Oxford, 2010], 4) argues that “the problem of suffering” is preferable to “the prob- lem of evil” since it is suffering which constitutes the nub of the theological problem.  For example, if there were no sentient beings who suffered from natural disasters,  there would be no problem. However, I am grateful to David Shatz and an anonymous  referee for this journal for pointing out in response to Stump that suffering can pose a  theological problem only on the assumption that it is evil, or bad. Thus “the problem  of evil” may be preferable after all. Although there are kinds of evil that involve no  suffering to the person who undergoes them (putting aside the suffering caused to  the person’s family and friends), such as sudden death or dementia, which neverthe- less raise the theological problem, suffering is a central sort of evil, and therefore “the  problem of suffering” is an acceptable way of referring to the theological problem. I  will refer in this article to “the problem of suffering,” though this usage is not intended  to suggest that “the problem of evil” would not be equally acceptable. MICHAEL J.

Even restricting the  discussion to classical rabbinic thought would involve the consideration  of many pertinent texts, particularly from the Talmud Bavli, which, as  Yaakov Elman and David Kraemer have argued, is much more open than  the Talmud Yerushalmi to the idea that suffering is not necessarily divine  punishment for sin and contains “the most original and radical respons- es in rabbinic Judaism to the problem of suffering.”2 For example, one  could relate passages in Ta‘anit 11a, Kiddushin 39b and 40b and Yoma  86b-87a, which appeal to life in the world to come after death to solve  the problem of suffering in this world, to, for instance, the argument  presented by Marilyn Adams that a post-mortem beatific vision of God  can retrospectively comfort even one who has suffered horrendously  and can give meaning to his or her suffering.3 Or one might consid- er passages in Berakhot 7a and Menah.ot 29b, among others, in light of  some contemporary discussions of what is known as sceptical theism.4 In this article, I want to focus on just one well-known rabbinic  concept discussed in the Talmud Bavli and bring it into conversation  with some contemporary discussions of the problem of suffering in  the philosophy of religion. This rabbinic concept is the well-known  one of yissurin shel ahavah, “the sufferings (or “afflictions”) of love”5  (henceforth YSA) as it appears in its locus classicus, namely the extensive  discussion in the Bavli at Berakhot 5a-b.6 The exploration of the theme  2.

I hope to do this in a future article. 5. The Soncino Talmud’s translation of Berakhot 5a-b, while translating yissurin as  “sufferings,” translates yissurin shel ahavah as “chastenings of love” or “chastisements  of love.” As David Shatz pointed out to me, however, R. Ammi’s statement in Shabbat  55a ve-ein yissurin be-lo avon, “there are no yissurin without iniquity,” seems to assume  that the term yissurin does not by itself (despite some well-known biblical usages of  the root y-s-r) have a punitive or corrective connotation, for otherwise it would not  need stating that there are no yissurin in the absence of sin. The standard translations  of yissurin as “suffering” and yissurin shel ahavah as “sufferings (or “afflictions”) of  love” thus appear justified and I will use these translations in this paper.  6. Elman, “The Suffering of the Righteous,” 337, n. 58, points out that YSA is the sole  exception to the view of suffering as punishment for sin in Palestinian sources. YSA  appears explicitly in Gen. Rabbah 92:1. </page> <page sequence="3"> 66 The Torah u-Madda Journal of suffering in Berakhot 5a-5b is the longest treatment of that topic in  the entire Bavli and indeed “the longest deliberation (by far) on suffer- ing as such in all classical rabbinic literature.” 7 I will examine some of  the ways in which the concept of YSA has been or could plausibly be  interpreted, and explore how these readings of YSA relate to some of  the theodicies analysed in contemporary philosophy of religion. This  exploration will hopefully enable YSA and these theodicies to shed light  on each other. Eleonore Stump has noted the importance of bringing  contemporary philosophical reflection on the problem of suffering into  contact with the rich tradition of Jewish thought on it. She has done this  in the context of Sa‘adyah Gaon’s interpretation of the Book of Job and  his theodicy, as well as by focusing on some key narratives in Tanakh.8  YSA, justifiably termed by David Shatz ”the most interesting concept in  Jewish discussions of suffering,”9 is certainly worth considering in light  of relevant contemporary philosophical theodicies. I do not aim in this article to present anything like a full argument  in favor of any particular theodicy that I connect with YSA, nor to deal  comprehensively with objections that can be raised against any theodicy,  though I do consider some objections to the particular theodicy which is  most central to this paper, namely “divine intimacy theodicy.” Moreover,  while I cite and discuss a significant range of post-talmudic rabbinic  teachings regarding YSA, including key medieval sources, I do not claim  that the roster considered here is anything approaching comprehensive.  I aim to consider enough of the most important sources to make the  inquiry worthwhile.  In the second section of this paper, I briefly survey the debate among  important rabbinic thinkers and commentators concerning whether  or not YSA should be interpreted as a punitive doctrine. According to  those who understand YSA as constituting punishment for sin despite  the element of love which distinguishes YSA from yissurin simpliciter,  YSA can be easily located on the historical map of theodicies in Western  thought: for them, it is a punishment theodicy, one of the most influ- ential kinds of theodicy (though not a popular one in contemporary  philosophical discussion). If YSA is not read as a punishment theodicy,  7. Kraemer, 188. 8. Eleonore Stump, “Saadia Gaon on the Problem of Evil,” Faith and Philosophy 14  (1997): 523-49; Wandering in Darkness, chs. 9-11. 9.

Harris 67 following the other view in the debate, then it becomes a more inter- esting concept and the question arises as to whether it parallels some  other theodicy or theodicies in the philosophical debate. In Section 3 of  the paper, I consider several ways in which YSA might be construed as  what is often termed a “soul-making theodicy” and how this plays out  in the reflections on YSA of some major rabbinic thinkers. In section  4, I distinguish between “soul-making” and what has been called in  contemporary philosophy of religion “divine intimacy” theodicy, and in  the fifth section, I argue that YSA is most compellingly construed as a  “divine intimacy” theodicy. I suggest various ways in which this might  be so and consider significant rabbinic writers on YSA who seem to have  understood YSA in this kind of way. 2. YSA: Punitive or Non–Punitive? In order to begin our analysis of the concept of YSA as it appears in Berakhot  5a-b, let us quote the opening of the relevant sugya at Berakhot 5a: Rava (some say, R. Hisda) says: If a man sees that painful sufferings visit  him, let him examine his conduct. For it is said: “Let us search and try our  ways, and return unto the Lord” [Lam. 3:40]. If he examines and finds  nothing [objectionable], let him attribute it to the neglect of the study of  the Torah. For it is said: “Happy is the man whom You chasten , O Lord,  and teach out of Your law”[Ps. 94:12].  If he did attribute it [thus], and  still did not find [on further examination a defect in this respect], let him  be sure that these are sufferings of love [yissurin shel ahavah]. For it is  said: “For whom the Lord loves He corrects” [Prov. 3:12].10  A person visited by sufferings is advised in the first instance to assume  that his or her sufferings constitute punishment for sin. If one can iden- tify no sin, including neglect of Torah study, then the suffering certainly  constitutes YSA. Although the implication of this is not necessarily that  YSA is non-punitive suffering, most—as detailed in this section —have  understood YSA in this way.11 This, indeed, is how Rashi in his commen- 10. All translations from Berakhot in this article are by Maurice Simon in the Soncino  edition of the Talmud, in most cases with some emendations. In this extract I have,  inter alia, amended the spelling of the opening word to “Rava” from “Raba” to make  clear the identity of the sage being referred to. All other translations in this paper are  mine unless otherwise stated.  11. It should be noted that though YSA can easily be interpreted as non-punitive at  this stage of the gemara’s discussion, this conception of YSA does not remain stable  throughout the sugya. At least at one later point at 5b, the suggestion of the gemara  </page> <page sequence="5"> 68 The Torah u-Madda Journal tary to this passage explicates YSA: “The Holy One, blessed be He, brings  suffering on him in this world without [his having committed] any sin  or iniquity, in order to increase his reward in the world to come beyond  [what] his merits [deserve].”12  Other major rabbinic thinkers similarly construe YSA as a  non-punitive notion. In the introduction to his commentary to the  Book of Job, Sa‘adyah Gaon presents a non-punitive interpretation of  YSA without mentioning YSA explicitly, but instead using the termi- nology of “trial and testing.”13 He distinguishes this “trial and test- ing” from suffering inflicted by God as a means of “purgation and  punishment”14 and describes it much as Rashi elucidates YSA: “An  upright servant, whose God knows that he will bear sufferings loosed  upon him and hold steadfast in his uprightness, is subjected to certain  sufferings, so that when he steadfastly bears them, his Lord may  reward him and bless him.”15 This kind of suffering, according to R.  Sa‘adyah, is what God inflicts on Job. A little later, R. Sa‘adyah states  that a trial or test is suffering in instances where “we have searched  ourselves and found nothing requiring . . . punishments.”16 Again,  R. Sa‘adyah does not explicitly mention YSA here, but the reference  to examining oneself and finding nothing deserving of punishment  seems to be a clear reference to the opening of the Berakhot 5a discus- sion of YSA cited above.17  In his commentary to the Torah, R. Bah.ye ben Asher also explicitly  interprets YSA non-punitively and states that its purpose is to increase  seems to be that YSA is punitive. Moreover, at several further points in the sugya it is  not fully clear whether the yissurin being referred to are YSA or not, which leads to  differences of opinion between commentators.  12. s.v. yissurin shel ahavah. However, at certain points later in his commentary on the  sugya, Rashi seems to suggest a punitive reading of YSA.  13. The Book of Theodicy: Translation and Commentary on the Book of Job, trans. by  Lenn Evan Goodman (New Haven, 1988), 125. Goodman understands R. Saʿadyah  as having YSA in mind, and I follow this suggestion because of R. Saʿadyah’s allu- sion to Berakhot 5a, as explained below. In general, though, the identification of “trial  and testing” or nissayon with YSA is by no means uncontroversial. Maimonides and  Nah.manides explicitly reject it; see n. 29 below.  14. Ibid. 15. Ibid., 125-26. 16. Ibid., 130. 17. Stump, “Saadia Gaon on the Problem of Evil,” argues that R. Saʿadyah’s concep- tion of this kind of suffering is more complex and involves the idea of the purging  of the soul in order to avoid attenuation of heavenly reward. This is still a non-puni- tive conception, however. Stump’s Saʿadyah has affinities with the positions of several  thinkers on YSA discussed below.  </page> <page sequence="6"> Michael J. Harris 69 later reward.18 Maharal, in the main discussion of YSA in his writings,  also maintains that YSA is non–punitive and is visited on a person  who is “righteous and fit for the supreme [spiritual] level.”19 A mystical  non-punitive understanding of YSA is presented by R. Isaiah Horowitz,  the Shelah, based on the kabbalist R. Avraham Galanti’s Kol Bokhim.20  R. Yeh.ezkel Landau in his Talmud commentary Z. iyyun le-Nefesh H. ayah  (Z.elah.) offers what sounds like an unpacking of Rashi: because it is rela- tively easy to serve God in strength and health, God sometimes brings  illness or weakness on the righteous so that they overcome significant  obstacles in serving Him and attain greater divine reward because of  the Mishnaic principle that “according to the effort [or pain] is the  reward.”21 R. Yosef Albo presents three understandings of YSA which  will be discussed in the course of this paper; the last two are clearly non-  punitive, and I will argue later that the first is as well. We will also  encounter further non-punitive interpretations of YSA.  However, other key figures take contrasting and sometimes  conflicting positions. Maimonides in Guide of the Perplexed 3:17  understands YSA in a similar way to Rashi, but in 3:24 criticizes this  idea of suffering not preceded by sin for the sake of greater reward as  incompatible with God’s justice. Thus, while Maimonides agrees with  the non-punitive interpretation of YSA, he holds that this renders the  whole notion deeply problematic. Me’iri takes this line of thought a  step further and interprets YSA as punitive: the more righteous a person  is, the more exacting God is regarding his or her misdemeanours.22  Nah.manides in Sha‘ar ha-Gemul interprets YSA punitively, emphasiz- ing that “even these afflictions are for the purpose of atonement and  18.

Sometimes in this chapter and the following one, Maharal mentions YSA in the  context of sin, but this seems to be sin in an extended sense, meaning attachment to  the material world. For further discussion of Maharal’s view of YSA, see below. 20. R. Isaiah Horowitz, Asarah Ma’amarot, Ma’amar Shelishi u-Reviʿi, section 134;  Ma’amar H. amishi, section 180. 21.

Me’iri, in H. ibbur  ha-Teshuvah (New York, 1950), Ma’amar 1, ch. 4, 586-87, presents YSA as punitive as  in Beit ha-Beh. irah, but adds the idea that sometimes a righteous person is afflicted  with YSA to a greater extent than is strictly justified by his or her small transgression,  in order to prompt that person to examine his ways and repent. This thought seems to  construe YSA as partly a punishment theodicy and partly a soul-making theodicy. On  soul-making theodicies, see Section 3.  </page> <page sequence="7"> 70 The Torah u-Madda Journal purging [relatively minor] sin.”23 Abarbanel, too, insists that all suffer- ing is punitive.24  R. Ya‘akov Yehoshua Falk, in his well-known work Penei Yehoshua,  presents two main interpretations of YSA.25 The first is non-punitive and  will be discussed in Section 3 below. The second interprets YSA as vicar- ious atonement: God brings suffering on the righteous person who has  not sinned in order to atone for the sins of the spiritually middle-rank- ing and the wicked. The righteous person is later compensated in the  world to come by having proportionate additional reward added to his  or her own reward from the spiritual “accounts,” as it were, of the wicked  and the middle-ranking. This interpretation of YSA seems to under- stand it at least in part as a punishment theodicy: part of what justifies  the suffering of the innocent righteous person is that his suffering is  atoning punishment for the sins of others (added to the fact that he  receives later compensation). Penei Yehoshua stresses that punishment  is required (presumably because of the demands of justice); it is just  that God inflicts the punishment on the righteous individual rather than  the non-righteous, because the non-righteous would rebel were punish- ment inflicted upon them.26 If YSA is interpreted punitively, as we have seen it is by a number of  key thinkers, then it is a punishment theodicy: the suffering of the indi- vidual is justifiably allowed or inflicted by God as punishment for sin. If,  however, we take our cue from the many important Jewish thinkers who  view YSA in non-punitive terms, the obvious question that then arises is:  23. Kitvei Rabbeinu Moshe ben Nah.man, ed. Rabbi C. D. Chavel (Jerusalem, 1964), 270.  See also ibid., 271. In a different way from Me’iri in H. ibbur ha-Teshuvah (see previ- ous note), Nah.manides also seems to combine an element of soul-making theodicy  with his punitive reading of YSA. Since every sin in some way contaminates the soul,  Nah.manides writes, even the righteous soul requires the cleansing which is accom- plished by YSA in order to attain the spiritual level in the world to come appropriate  to the good deeds it has performed.  24. Commentary to the Torah, Gen. 15:1, fifteenth question. 25. Penei Yehoshua on Berakhot 5a, s.v. talah ve-lo maz.a. 26. One might object that Penei Yehoshua’s interpretation of YSA here is not a punish- ment theodicy at all. The term he uses throughout is yissurin, which could mean either  “suffering” or “punishment,” as opposed to, say, the unambiguous term onesh, and one  might interpret him as meaning that suffering is metaphysically necessary in order to  purge sin, but that this suffering is not punitive (cf. the discussion of R. Yosef Albo’s  first type of YSA in Section 3B below). But the question would then arise how the  suffering of the innocent righteous person works to purge the sins of others. Moreover,  Penei Yehoshua’s language in the relevant passage as a whole does not seem to suggest  this non-punitive explanation. </page> <page sequence="8"> Michael J. Harris 71 How might non-punitive understandings be developed, and what forms  might they take? For our purposes in this paper, we must also ask: How  might YSA, on different understandings, relate to theodicies discussed in  the philosophy of religion? 3. YSA as a Soul-Making Theodicy A traditional group of theodicies in the philosophy of religion that  continues to attract significant attention centers on the notion of  “soul-making.” Broadly, a soul-making theodicy argues that the justi- fication of God’s inflicting suffering is that this facilitates the building  and development of moral and spiritual character.27 Although there do  not seem to be any other obvious sources in the Babylonian Talmud for  a soul-making theodicy, YSA could plausibly be interpreted in this kind  of way.28  In this section, I consider two ways in which YSA might be inter- preted as a kind of soul-making theodicy.  A. Actualizing Potential One way in which YSA might be read as a version of soul-making theodi- cy is that the potential of the sufferer to withstand suffering and maintain  his or her moral excellence is realized, made actual, and this elevates the  sufferer to even greater spiritual heights than he had attained previously.  This understanding of YSA can be connected to the concept of nissayon, a  divine test or trial, the archetype of which, of course, is Abraham’s trial at  the Akedah, explicitly described by the Torah as a test in Gen. 22:1. If the  test is successfully passed by the sufferer, he or she will grow spiritually.  27. See, e.g., the classic contemporary articulation of soul-making theodicy, John Hick’s  Evil and the God of Love (2nd ed., Basingstoke and New York, 2010); Daniel Speak, “Free  Will and Soul-Making Theodicies,” The Blackwell Companion to the Problem of Evil, ch.  14. Hick places far more emphasis on moral than on spiritual development. 28. David Shatz has already made the suggestion that some interpretations of YSA  can be seen as potential precedents for soul-making theodicies. See David Shatz,  “Does Jewish Law Express Jewish Philosophy? The Curious Case of Theodicies,” in  Shatz, Jewish Thought in Dialogue: Essays on Thinkers, Theologies and Moral Theories  (Boston, 2009), 293 and 301, n. 10. See also his “On Constructing a Jewish Theodicy”  in The Blackwell Companion to The Problem of Evil, 309-25. In this section, I expand  on Shatz’s suggestion by categorising different ways in which YSA can be read as a  soul-making theodicy and offering an analysis of some of the relevant sources. As I  will argue in Section 5, however, I believe that YSA is better read in the light of divine  intimacy theodicy than soul-making theodicy. </page> <page sequence="9"> 72 The Torah u-Madda Journal R. Yosef Albo provides a detailed analysis of YSA in Sefer ha-Ikkarim,  offering three possible understandings of the concept, each of which he  considers legitimate, and to each of which he applies the term nissayon.29  R. Albo’s third type of YSA, which he identifies as the most important  category, are visited only on the completely righteous who have already  undergone the first two types of YSA (we will return to discussion of  the first two kinds later). The purpose of this third type of YSA is to  increase the reward of the sufferer so that he or she receives “the reward  of the good deed and not just reward for a good intention” because the  sufferer has actually gone through trouble and difficulty in showing love  of God through a particular deed, rather than simply being willing to  undergo difficulty. The example given by R. Albo is the Akedah. Despite  the focus on reward, there is undoubtedly also a strong soul-making  element in R. Albo’s third category of YSA. R. Albo writes that the righ- teous sufferer will be worthy of his greater reward “because through the  deed his heart will be strengthened in the love of God, since every action  establishes a stronger disposition in the soul than can be achieved with- out action.” Doing the deed required by God, which is the third kind of  YSA, improves the soul. This is emphasised again later in his discussion:  “A person does not reach the level of complete love [of God] until he  actually suffers difficulty and toil for the love of God.” B. Purging the Soul  We can identify a second way of understanding YSA as a type of  soul-making theodicy by referring once again to Penei Yehoshua on  Berakhot 5a.30 In Section 2 above, we noted Rashi’s explication of  YSA. Penei Yehoshua raises a straightforward but powerful difficulty  for Rashi’s analysis: Why can’t God, Who is omnipotent, just give all  the benefits of the world to come to the righteous person without that  person first having to endure suffering? 31 Penei Yehoshua responds that  29. Ma’amar 4, ch. 13. Maimonides in Guide 3:17 explicitly rejects the idea that the  trials mentioned in the Torah, such as that of Abraham at the Akedah, come under  the rubric of YSA. YSA, for Maimonides, is a rabbinic concept which does not feature  in the Torah itself. Nah.manides in Shaʿar ha-Gemul (Kitvei Rabbeinu Moshe ben  Nah.man, 272-73) does not consider a nissayon to be YSA or any kind of punitive  suffering.  30. S.v. talah ve-lo maz.a. Penei Yehoshua’s interpretation of YSA, which I present in this  section, is the first of the main two interpretations which he offers, and the one which  he himself believes is more suited to the language of the gemara in Berakhot 5a. We  mentioned earlier his second interpretation, focusing on vicarious atonement.  31. Sa‘adyah Gaon, The Book of Beliefs and Opinions, trans. Samuel Rosenblatt (New  </page> <page sequence="10"> Michael J. Harris 73 subsequent to the damage done by the serpent of the Garden of Eden to  all future souls, even the souls of the completely righteous, it would be  impossible without suffering to purge the soul of the righteous person  from the material and physical and allow that soul to achieve its full spir- itual reward in the world to come.32 Even without Adam’s sin caused by  the serpent, Penei Yehoshua continues, the human soul would have been  too attached to the material to be able, without the purging effected by  suffering, ultimately to receive the supernal light of the higher worlds.  As noted earlier, Nah.manides’ understanding of YSA includes this kind  of soul-making element, but for Nah.manides, the damage to the soul  has been caused by the sufferer’s own sin, not by the Edenic serpent.  Additionally, Penei Yehoshua’s interpretation of YSA is non-punitive, as  opposed to Nah.manides’ punitive conception.  R. Yosef Albo’s treatment of YSA is again relevant in this context.  As noted above, R. Albo in Sefer ha-Ikkarim presents a detailed anal- ysis of YSA and divides YSA into three categories. It is the first cate- gory which is germane here. At the beginning of his discussion, R.  Albo defines the first type of YSA as suffering inflicted by God on a  very righteous person out of love in order to “purge some impurity  or uncleanliness in his soul caused by sin.” Some of the language used  by R. Albo in the continuation of his discussion of his first category  of YSA is Nah.manides’, and he explicitly cites Nah.manides’ view that  all suffering, including YSA, is a result of sin. It seems at first glance,  therefore, that R. Albo’s position regarding his first type of YSA is iden- tical to Nah.manides’ overall position regarding YSA, namely a punitive  understanding combined with an element of soul-making theodicy.33  However, a close reading of the first paragraph of R. Albo’s analysis  reveals that he does not in fact see the first type of YSA as punitive. He  says that even a very righteous person cannot avoid various types of  Haven, 1948), 214-15, raises the same difficulty for the view that an innocent indi- vidual might be subjected to trials in order to later receive compensation for them.  R. Saʿadyah does not explicitly refer to YSA in that discussion but cites Prov. 3:12,  which, as we saw above, is quoted in Berakhot 5a as soon as the concept of YSA is  introduced. R. Saʿadyah’s response to the difficulty is that goods conferred by God on  human beings by way of compensation are valued more highly than goods distributed  purely by divine grace. 32. Fascinatingly, Penei Yehoshua’s view here is close to that of Aquinas, for whom  “suffering is medicinal for the cancer of the will innate in all post-Fall human beings.  Unless that cancer is cured, human beings cannot be united to God in the afterlife”  (Stump, “Saadia Gaon on the Problem of Evil,” 532).  33. See above n. 23 on Nah.manides’ position.  </page> <page sequence="11"> 74 The Torah u-Madda Journal minor sin, but that these sins “are not deserving of punishment” (einan  re’uyin le-onesh). Nevertheless, he continues, in language very close to  Nah.manides’, “since they [the minor sins] pollute and impurify the  soul, they can be a cause of reducing its spiritual level in the world to  come.” He then repeats that the minor sins of the righteous person are  not deserving of punishment, but “even though it [the minor sin] is  not deserving of punishment, it requires atonement” (af al pi she-einah  re’uyah le-onesh z. erikhah kapparah). This is a clear departure from Nah. manides’ view of YSA as punitive.  What R. Albo is introducing here is a subtle distinction between  punishment and atonement. He is suggesting that suffering can be  inflicted by God to atone for sin without that suffering constituting a  punishment for sin. Its goal is rather the essential cleansing of the soul  from the stain left by the sin. He sums this up in the final sentence of  the paragraph: “It is from the love of God for the righteous person that  he brings suffering upon him, to purge the dirt and impurity that is in  the soul, in order that it achieve the spiritual level that is appropriate  for it according to its good deeds and that nothing will impede this.”34  R. Albo (regarding his first category of YSA) agrees with Nah.manides,  whom he cites in his next paragraph, that “there is never suffering with- out sin.” However, despite his citation of Nah.manides and his appearing  to identify his position with that of Nah.manides, R. Albo differs with  Nah.manides as to whether the suffering consequent on sin is neces- sarily punitive. For R. Albo, the purpose of the first category of YSA is  soul-making rather than punishment.35 We have identified two ways in which YSA might be interpreted as a  kind of soul-making theodicy. David Shatz argues, however, that the idea  found in Jewish sources that YSA enhances the spirituality of the sufferer  differs from standard soul-making theodicies in contemporary philo- sophical discussion in three important respects.36 First, contemporary  soul-making theodicies usually aim to justify God’s allowing suffering,  34. R. Albo’s position thus ends up being very close to that of Saʿadyah Gaon on  Stump’s interpretation of him; see n. 17 above.  35. It might be objected that the focus of the interpretations of YSA of Penei Yehoshua  and R. Albo discussed in this sub-section is not so much soul-making as preventing  diminution of the righteous person’s eternal reward. However, it seems fair to take  the purpose of YSA on these interpretations as soul-making since the preservation of  full reward and the achievement of the appropriate spiritual level in the afterlife are  inseparable.  36. Shatz, “On Constructing a Jewish Theodicy,” 317. </page> <page sequence="12"> Michael J. Harris 75 rather than His inflicting it. Second, they do not aim to justify the suffer- ings of the righteous in particular. Third, soul-making theodicies justify  suffering in terms of the moral improvement it fosters in others, not  in the sufferer. Nevertheless, as Shatz puts it, “we have a close enough  fit [in Jewish sources] to furnish a potential precedent for a contempo- rary-style SMT [= soul-making theodicy].”37 In one respect, I believe that the fit between YSA and soul-making  theodicies may be somewhat stronger than Shatz suggests. In gener- al, Hick seems in Evil and the God of Love not to conform to Shatz’s  template, but instead to focus his soul-making theodicy both on the  sufferer him- or herself and on others. Admittedly, however, Hick does  focus solely on the moral improvement of people other than the suffer- er in justifying what he terms excessive or “dysteleological” suffering,  i.e. suffering which is entirely counter-productive to the soul-making of  the sufferer or simply outright destructive, such as brain disease or an  earthquake. Hick argues that these must exist “in a world that is to be the  scene of compassionate love and self-giving for others,”38 evoking “the  unselfish kindness and goodwill which are among the highest values of  personal life.”39 Richard Swinburne, although developing a theodicy that goes  beyond soul-making, clearly draws on the tradition of soul-making  theodicies40 and explicitly favors theodicies which appeal to the moral  growth of both the sufferer and others: Very many Christian writers have stressed the value of suffering for the  human beings who suffer, in enabling them to form their souls for good.  By showing courage and sympathy in the face of their suffering and that  of others, people can become naturally good people. That is a theme  especially prominent in the Eastern Orthodox tradition, which I shall  warmly endorse.41 Similarly, he writes that good character . . . is the sort of character which responds readily to suffering (in others  and in oneself) in the right way. Natural evil provides the opportunity  not merely to be heroic but to make ourselves naturally heroic. Without a  37. Ibid. See also Shatz, “Does Jewish Law Express Jewish Philosophy?,” 293. 38.

In order to do this, it is necessary first to consid- er the relationship between the soul-making and divine intimacy types  of theodicy. 4. Soul-Making Theodicy and Divine Intimacy Theodicy Laura Waddell Ekstrom argues that some suffering can constitute a  religious experience and a path to knowledge of God, to intimacy with  the divine.43 Ekstrom calls this “the divine intimacy theodicy.”44 On  this theodicy, God sometimes permits personal suffering “in order to  provide occasions in which we can perceive God, understand him to  some degree, know him, even meet him directly.”45 More will be said about divine intimacy theodicy in the following  section, but the above characterization is sufficient to pose the ques- tion of the relationship between soul-making and divine intimacy  42. Ibid., 169. Some of the literature dealing with objections to soul-making theodicy  also focuses on the moral development of both the sufferer and others. In his “An  Examination of the “Soul-Making” Theodicy,” American Philosophical Quarterly 7:2  (April 1970), Clement Dore, in summarizing the soul-making theodicy, lists “stead- fastness, charity and forebearance” as examples of the virtues that suffering makes  possible (119). Later in the article, he refers to bearing suffering courageously (120).  H.J. McCloskey, “God and Evil,” The Philosophical Quarterly 10:39 (April 1960),  discusses (and opposes) soul-making theodicy at 104-09 (though without using this  term). He consistently understands the theodicy he is criticizing as focused equally  on virtues that suffering can evoke in the sufferer and on virtues that it can evoke in  others, referring to “courage, endurance, benevolence, sympathy” (106), twice on 108  to courage, endurance, charity and sympathy, and on 109 to “fortitude in his own  sufferings, and sympathetic kindness in others’.” 43. Laura Waddell Ekstrom, “Suffering as Religious Experience,” in Christian Faith and  the Problem of Evil, ed. Peter van Inwagen (Grand Rapids, Michigan and Cambridge,  2004), 95-110. Ekstrom also presents the divine intimacy theodicy in Laura W.  Ekstrom, “A Christian Theodicy,” in The Blackwell Companion to the Problem of Evil,  266-80. 44.

Harris 77 theodicies.46 The idea of intimacy with God seems important to Hick’s  soul-making theodicy. Daniel Speak, for example, summarises Hick’s  theodicy in the following way: Hick holds that God aims to bring  human beings into deep intimacy with Him. But this can happen only  if human beings have first reached an elevated moral standard, if our  souls have first undergone the necessary transformation. The existence  of suffering in the world is necessary, in turn, for this transformation to  take place.47 From this description, Hick’s soul-making theodicy sounds  like a kind of divine intimacy theodicy.48 The description also makes  clear that Hick’s soul-making theodicy is “forward-looking” in the sense  that it construes suffering as a means to desirable ends rather than as  itself an expression of God’s love. As elaborated below in Section 5, one  type of divine intimacy theodicy also construes suffering as a means  to an end rather than as being itself an expression of God’s love. Since  this “forward-looking” character is shared by soul-making theodicy and  one type of divine intimacy theodicy, it might be argued that this kind  of divine intimacy theodicy should simply be considered a version of  soul-making theodicy. However, a crucial difference between the soul-making theodicy and  all types of divine intimacy theodicy is that, as we shall see more elabo- rately in the next section, divine intimacy theodicy construes the intimacy  of the sufferer with God as something that is achieved in the here-and- now, in this world (though no doubt proponents of divine intimacy  theodicy would concede that the intimacy can be further intensified in  a life beyond the grave). Hick, however, concedes that “the soul-making  process does in fact fail in our own world at least as often as it succeeds”49  and that to solve this problem one must appeal to Christian eschatologi- cal belief: “Belief in an after-life is . . . crucial for theodicy.”50 The process  of soul-making must continue beyond the grave if soul-making theod- icy is to be plausible. He states that “[t]heodicy . . . must look towards  the future, expecting a triumphant resolution in the eventual perfect  46. I am very grateful to an anonymous referee for this journal for detailed and helpful  comments highlighting the need to clarify this relationship and hence the need for this  section of the paper.  47. Speak, “Free Will and Soul-Making Theodicies.” 48. The theme of intimacy with God is also stressed by Marilyn McCord Adams in her  summary of Hick’s position in her Foreword to the 2010 reissue of Evil and the God  of Love.  49. Hick, 336.  50. Ibid., 338.  </page> <page sequence="15"> 78 The Torah u-Madda Journal fulfilment of God’s good purpose.”51 Hick describes the “bare bones” of  his theodicy thus: “[T]he evils of this life are necessary to prepare us as  moral personalities for the life of the future heavenly Kingdom, and . . .  they are justified by the fact that in that Kingdom all evil will have been  left behind and unimaginable good will fill our lives.”52 So intimacy with  God (in fact, Hick talks of “fellowship” with God)53 is attainable only in  the hereafter rather than in this life, and the good which does the work of  theodicy and which justifies the suffering of this world is a good located  in the eschaton. Ultimately “our theodicy must find the meaning of evil  . . . in the magnitude of the good to which it leads . . . a kingdom which is  yet to come in its full glory and permanence.”54 In sum, the classic contemporary presentation of soul-making theo- dicy, namely Hick’s, is impelled to maintain that a close relationship  with God facilitated by suffering is attainable only beyond this life—in  an eschatological future—and only after a very long process of personal  moral and spiritual development. It is “forward-looking” towards a close  relationship with God only in this eschatological sense. This clearly distin- guishes Hick’s soul-making theodicy from divine intimacy theodicies  which, as we shall now see in section 5, emphasize the much more direct  achievement, through suffering, of intimacy with God in this world.55  5. YSA as Divine Intimacy Theodicy Intimacy with God through Suffering versus Intimacy in Suffering In a similar vein to Ekstrom, Diogenes Allen makes an observa- tion linking suffering and love: “Some religious people report that  51. Ibid., 340.  52. Ibid., 351.  53. See ibid., 196, 198, 237.  54. Ibid., 261.  55. In her two articles cited above, n. 43, Ekstrom, though not making the contrast  with soul-making theodicy that I have drawn here, clearly perceives divine intimacy  theodicy as distinct from it. In “A Christian Theodicy,” where she writes, at 267, that  divine intimacy theodicy is supplemental to all standard theodicies, she clearly seems  to intend “supplemental but distinct.” She does not speak of divine intimacy theodicy  as having any relationship with soul-making theodicy in particular. At 272, n. 8, she  talks of divine intimacy theodicy as a supplement to free will theodicy in the sense that  it provides further explanations, in some cases, of evils that are already explained by  free will theodicy. Her focus in the whole article is very much on the intensified rela- tionship with God that suffering makes possible rather than on the moral or spiritual  improvement of the soul. </page> <page sequence="16"> Michael J. Harris 79 suffering, instead of being contrary to the love of God, is actually a  medium in and through which his love can be experienced.”56 Simone  Weil writes: “I only felt in the midst of my suffering the presence of a  love.”57 This idea suggests itself as a plausible interpretation of YSA.58  YSA can be understood as suffering visited by God upon a person  whom He loves in order to provide for greater closeness and height- ened love between God and that person. Linking suffering with divine  love is a possible response to the problem of suffering, a theodicy.59 The idea suggested by Ekstrom, Allen, and Weil that one can arrive  at a heightened knowledge of God through suffering is amplified in  Eleonore Stump’s treatment of the Book of Job in Chapter 9 of her  Wandering in Darkness. Referring to Job 42:5, “I had [previously only]  heard of you, but now my eye has seen you,” Stump writes:  While God has been talking to him [following all of Job’s suffering], Job  has been, somehow, seeing God. The communication between God and  Job is thus, in some sense, face-to-face communication . . . in the course  of the divine speeches, God has been somehow directly present to Job,  where the presence at issue produces the kind of cognition that would  require the literal sight of a human face if the cognition in question were  of a human being . . . God is present to Job with significant personal  presence.60  This knowledge of God, “[l]ike knowledge of persons . . . is non-propo- sitional.”61 So Job comes to a new, deeper, and closer kind of knowledge  56. Diogenes Allen, “Natural Evil and the Love of God,” in The Problem of Evil, ed.  Adams and Adams, 189. 57. Quoted by Allen, ibid., 197. 58. The commonality between Weil’s thought and the concept of YSA is also noticed  by N. Verbin, Divinely Abused: A Philosophical Perspective on Job and his Kin (London,  2010), 47-48, though Verbin does not discuss divine intimacy theodicy.  59. Although he does not refer in his remarks to YSA or suggest a theodicy (indeed, he  famously repudiates the enterprise of theodicy), R. Joseph B. Soloveitchik relates in a  moving passage how when he was very ill and awaiting an operation, feeling cut off  from even his closest relatives, he felt himself to be alone with God: “A lonely being  meeting the loneliest Being in utter seclusiion is a traumatic but also a great expe- rience.” See Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveichik, Out of the Whirlwind: Essays on Mourning,  Suffering and the Human Condition, ed. David Shatz, Joel B. Wolowelsky and Reuven  Ziegler (Jersey City, N.J., 2003), 134.

Shatz, “On Constructing a Jewish Theodicy,” 317, quotes Job 42: 5 to  show that a crucial element of the soul-making theodicy appears in the Book of Job.  This verse, Shatz argues, “intimates a sharpened religious perception”—Job has grown  spiritually. It seems to me that the verse more powerfully suggests a new intimacy with  </page> <page sequence="17"> 80 The Torah u-Madda Journal of God through suffering. One could similarly interpret YSA as suffer- ing that God brings upon a person in order to facilitate this more  profound knowledge of Him, this intensified relationship with Him  that can be described as love.62 Interestingly Stump, who does not refer  to YSA in her discussion, uses the word “love” to characterize Job’s  face-to-face experience with God that comes about because of his  suffering.63  There are several possibilities regarding how exactly the suffering  visited on a person in YSA might facilitate greater intimacy between  God and the sufferer. YSA might, as Weil envisages regarding suffering,  lead to greater intimacy with God by, for example, the sufferer yielding  to his or her suffering and experiencing greater closeness with God as  a result. We have already mentioned Penei Yehoshua’s two main inter- pretations of YSA. Slightly later in his commentary to Berakhot 5a, he  seems to offer a concise third reading of YSA along these Weilian lines.64  He writes that “the righteous through suffering [yissurim] come out of  the dimension of servitude, having been called servants of God, and  from now, after their suffering, are called children of God and come  closer under the wings of the Divine Presence.” Penei Yehoshua seems  to be referring in this extract to YSA, even if he might also be referring  to yissurin in general; the fact that he refers to the suffering of the righ- teous suggests this. Moreover, he is explicit later in this section of his  commentary that he takes the stage in the gemara’s argument on which  he is commenting to refer to YSA as well as to other kinds of yissurin.  Weil maintains that there is also a level beyond suffering, which she  terms “affliction” (malheur), summarized by Marilyn McCord Adams as  “a condition associated with long-term physical pain, which crushes the  the Divine, a second-person loving relationship. 62. Indeed, Maimonides in Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Teshuvah 10:6 famously links  knowledge of God with love of God. 63. Stump, Wandering in Darkness, 196. This paragraph is not intended to suggest  that Stump explicitly advocates a divine intimacy theodicy in her treatment of Job  (in fact, she never uses the terminology “divine intimacy theodicy”). Indeed, Stump  emphasizes in Chapter 13 of Wandering in Darkness that one can’t just reduce enor- mously rich biblical narratives to neat theodicies. But she clearly believes that her read- ing of Job at least gestures in the direction of plausible theodicies. At one point, she  writes, for example: “[T]he ultimate aim of God’s providential care in the narrative [of  the Book of Job] is closeness to God and the greatness consequent on that closeness”  (222). “Closeness to God” suggests divine intimacy theodicy and “greatness” hints at a  soul-making theodicy.   64.

Harris 81 afflicted by destroying social relations and filling them with self-loath- ing, shame, and defilement almost in proportion to their innocence.”65 In  “affliction,” God’s love is experienced not just through suffering but—a  distinction emphasised by Allen—in suffering.66 The suffering itself is  experienced as God’s love, like the physical embrace of a friend which  is so tight that it hurts.67 Weil links this with Jesus’s affliction on the  cross, but it is not necessary either to follow this distinctively Christian  route or to understand YSA as involving “affliction” in the Weilian sense  in order to see that YSA might facilitate greater closeness between God  and the sufferer either because 1) it is suffering which results in such  closeness or, more radically, 2) it is suffering which is itself God’s love,  His embrace, as it were. The passage quoted above from Berakhot 5a  continues with a further teaching concerning YSA:  Rava,68 in the name of R. Sah.orah, in the name of R. Huna, says: If the  Holy One, blessed be He, is pleased with a man, he crushes him with  painful sufferings. For it is said: And the Lord was pleased with [him,  hence] he crushed him by disease [Is. 53:10].69 “Pleased with” in the Soncino Talmud translation of this passage seems  to me a rather anodyne rendition of h.afez. , the term used both by Is.  53:10 and R. Huna. The term seems very often to connote strong desire,  something approaching love.70 So R. Huna is almost explicit about YSA  involving God’s crushing, loving “embrace.” This is alternative 2 (or, if  one is not prepared to allow that love is connoted by h.afez. , alternative  1: someone whom God strongly desires and wants to bring closer to  Him he crushes with suffering which will lead to greater intimacy).71  65.

The gemara’s citation of this text from the “suffering servant” passage is doubtless  part of the motivation for those who offer vicarious atonement interpretations of YSA.  The gemara also cites another part of this verse in this sugya. Alshikh actually cites Is.  53:10 when presenting a vicarious atonement reading of YSA in his commentary to  Prov. 3:11. For further discussion of Alshikh’s views, see below.  70. See e.g. Gen. 34:19; I Sam. 19:1. In the well-known verse of Ps. 34:13, the root h. -f-z.  is used in parallel to the root a-h-v. 71. An anonymous referee for this journal acutely pointed out that the opening state- ment of Rava in the sugya (quoted at the beginning of Section 2 above) cannot be  interpreting YSA according to alternative 2, since the statement focuses on a person  who suffers and does not understand why he or she is suffering. But if the person  </page> <page sequence="19"> 82 The Torah u-Madda Journal Significantly, the gemara goes on immediately to insist that R. Huna’s  statement applies (which I take to mean that the sufferings count as  YSA72) only if the afflictions are accepted by the sufferer with love. This  ideal of acceptance is also highlighted by Alshikh at the conclusion of  his commentary to Prov. 3:11.73 While there is a general ideal posited in  many Jewish sources of accepting divinely-imposed suffering with love  and joy, or at least without complaint,74 willing acceptance seems to be  partly constitutive of YSA.75 This underlines that central to YSA is rela- tionship with and closeness to God. Some Objections to Divine Intimacy Theodicy and Its Use in a   Jewish Context Before considering further possibilities regarding how exactly the suffer- ing visited on a person in YSA might facilitate greater intimacy between  God and the sufferer, we should consider some likely objections to  divine intimacy theodicy, and in particular to its use in a Jewish context.  The first objection is that divine intimacy theodicy is appropriate  for a Christian theological context but not a Jewish one. As already indi- cated, divine intimacy theodicy resonates from a Christian perspective.  As Ekstrom puts it, “Is not suffering as a means to intimacy with God  exactly what one would expect of a God who, on Christian scripture  experiences God in the suffering, the suffering will be explicable and he will not  wonder why it is occurring. In my view, the best reading of the opening two statements  of the sugya is therefore that the first statement interprets YSA according to alternative  1 and the second interprets it according to alternative 2.  72. The Schottenstein translation of the Talmud understands this differently: YSA “are  visited upon a person only if they are accepted with consent.” See The Babylonian  Talmud, The Schottenstein Edition, the Artscroll Series (New York, 1997). In any event,  on the Schottenstein translation, willing acceptance of the suffering is crucial—it is a  necessary condition of YSA’s being visited. 73. R. Bah.ye ben Asher in the passage from his Torah commentary referred to above  also emphasises this element. The specific suffering he is dealing with there is that of  the Israelites in Egypt. He states that that suffering is YSA designed to increase the  Israelites’ reward “if they withstand that suffering and bear it with love.”  74. See e.g. Avot 6:5; Taʿanit 8a; J. T. Shekalim 5:4; Maharal, Netivot Olam, Netiv ha-Yis- surin, ch. 1.   75. This is brought out strikingly by Alshikh in his commentary to Prov. 10:16. There  he refers to the stories of the sages afflicted with YSA near the end of the Berakhot  5a-5b sugya (the stories are discussed further below). Alshikh states that God removed  the sufferings of these sages because they were not prepared to gladly accept them— the raison d’etre of the sufferings, and therefore their continued existence itself was  crucially dependent on their being gladly borne. (The essence of the same idea lies  behind the Schottenstein translation; see n. 72 above). See also in this connection  Alshikh’s commentary to Lam. 3:26. </page> <page sequence="20"> Michael J. Harris 83 and tradition, took on human form and suffered along with and for  the world?”76 Ekstrom develops her divine intimacy theodicy in this  distinctively Christian direction.77 But the core idea of suffering as inti- macy with the divine is, as we have noted, certainly reminiscent of YSA.  Moreover, as we have also argued, Job 42:5 indicates how the idea of  suffering as leading to intimacy with God can be solidly grounded in a  biblical perspective. The idea of suffering as productive of intimacy with  God also seems to be supported by the well-known teaching of H. azal  that God sometimes causes suffering because He longs for the prayers  of the righteous or of His people. God sometimes invites a person or  group, through suffering, to make a deeper connection with Him and to  call out for His Presence alongside him or them.78  Although, as just noted, Ekstrom develops the divine intimacy theo- dicy in some specifically Christian ways, arguing that God sometimes  allows human suffering in order that the sufferer can share something  of the experience of suffering on the cross, she emphasizes that even  if one adopts the doctrine of divine impassibility (as some tradition- al Christians do), a divine intimacy theodicy is still feasible: “There  remains the possibility that God shows himself to a human sufferer in  a unique way, even if there is no divine suffering.”79 Given Maimonides’  famous antipathy towards anthropopathism, it may seem that the wisest  course for Jews attracted to divine intimacy theodicy would be to opt  for this “divine-impassibility-compliant” version of it. But even if the  idea that God is able to suffer is essential to a divine intimacy theod- icy, it is an idea to which traditional Jews can at least relate.80 It is, of  course, not just Tanakh but the literature of H. azal as well—sometimes  drawing on biblical texts for this purpose—that makes occasional refer- ence to God’s suffering. Let me briefly list some well-known examples.81  Exodus Rabbah 2:5 portrays God saying to Moses: “Do you not sense  that I am in pain just as the Israelites are in pain [as slaves in Egypt]  76. Ekstrom, “Suffering as Religious Experience,” 96. 77. Marilyn McCord Adams also takes the idea that suffering can deepen one’s rela- tionship with and knowledge of God in Christian directions in her article “Horrendous  Evils and the Goodness of God” and in her book of the same title. 78. See, e.g., Yevamot 64a, Ex. Rabbah 21:5.  79. Ekstrom, “A Christian Theodicy,” 274. 80. I thank Sam Lebens for suggesting putting the point in this way.  81. Such examples, as well as others not mentioned here, are frequently cited. See, for  instance, the succinct discussion in Jakob J. Petuchowski, Theology and Poetry: Studies  in the Medieval Piyyut (London, 1978), ch. 8: “The Suffering God.”  </page> <page sequence="21"> 84 The Torah u-Madda Journal . . . I am, as it were, a partner in their pain.” Another midrashic passage  teaches: “At every time at which Israel is enslaved, the Shekhinah is, as it  were, enslaved with them.”82 There is also the celebrated notion of the  Shekhinah being in exile with the Jewish people and returning from exile  with them.83  Berakhot 29a and H. agigah 5b refer to God weeping, Eikhah  Rabbati Petih. ta 8 depicts God crying because of the Exile from Zion, and  Petih. ta 24 His suffering and weeping because of the destruction of the  Temple. Psalm 91:15, which reads, in part, “I am with him in trouble,”  is interpreted by H. azal to mean that God shares the afflictions of each  individual Jew.84 Mishnah Sanhedrin 6:5 (46a) describes the Shekhinah  participating in human pain.85 Statements in H. azal regarding the suffer- ing of God may be intended as metaphorical, but, as Shalom Carmy  points out, H. azal clearly considered such language acceptable.86 The idea  that God might in some sense suffer is not an utterly alien and unaccept- able one to them.87  Nehemia Polen has noted that “hasidic masters, in contrast to  thinkers committed to the tradition of philosophical rationalism, were  82.

Though Eliezer Berkovits, in the course of a critique of A.J. Heschel’s doctrine of  divine pathos, argues that in Megillah 29a and Sanhedrin 46a “the very fact that the  term Shekhinah is used, and not that of God, is in itself an indication how strong- ly rooted in the Jewish consciousness is the thought of God’s impassibility” (Eliezer  Berkovits, Major Themes in Modern Philosophies of Judaism [New York, 1974], 218). Berkovits goes on to provide instances in which the Shekhinah is not explicitly  mentioned and the term kivyakhol is used; anthropopathic language in H. azal is, for  Berkovits, always metaphorical. R. Aharon Lichtenstein also notes the use of kivyakhol  or other qualifications in midrashim concerning the destruction of the Temple and  exile in Eikhah Rabbati (Aharon Lichtenstein, “The Duties of the Heart and Response  to Suffering,” in Jewish Perspectives on the Experience of Suffering, ed. Shalom Carmy  [Northvale, N.J, 1999], 51-52). Berkovits also insists that references to “the sorrow of  the Shekhinah” and “sorrow on High” in kabbalistic and H. asidic literature are fully  compatible with the notion of God’s impassibility (218-19). In Judaism in general, for  Berkovits, “the theological climate is determined by a long tradition of affirmation of  divine impassibility in face of numerous biblical texts to the contrary” (224). 86.

Harris 85 generally warmly disposed to the anthropomorphic and anthropopathic  tendency within Judaism.”88 In his work Esh Kodesh, written in Warsaw  during the Holocaust, the H. asidic master Rabbi Kalonymus Shapira  (1889-1943) develops a theology in which the idea of divine suffering  is central. R. Shapira describes God’s suffering as infinite and beyond  human comprehension.89 This kind of theology, as Polen points out,  “does not emerge from a vacuum; it is strongly rooted in a Kabbalistic- Hasidic worldview . . . . [t]he theme of infinite Divine suffering cannot  be viewed as an isolated and idiosyncratic utterance of a religious leader  flung about wildly in a cruel maelstrom.”90 Interestingly, at one point in  his writings, R. Shapira actually mentions God’s suffering along with the  sufferer of YSA (as well as with other kinds of sufferers): “[T]here are  some sufferings which we suffer on our own account—whether for our  sins, or as sufferings of love in order to purge and purify us—in which  case He, blessed be He, just suffers along with us.”91  Although, as mentioned at the outset, I do not intend to deal  systematically with objections to the theodicies discussed in this article,  it is worth noting two other objections to the divine intimacy theodicy  which are potentially so damaging that if they cannot be rebutted they  render it very implausible, and with it any reading of YSA as a divine  intimacy theodicy.  One is termed by Ekstrom “the objection from cruelty.”92 Permitting  suffering seems to be a cruel way of fostering intimacy; it is implausible  to hold that a wholly beneficent God would operate in this way. To take  Ekstrom’s example, a parent who installed no safety gates on the stairs  at her home so that her child would fall down the stairs and run to her  for comfort would justifiably be considered cruel. Ekstrom’s response  to this objection is that suffering is not a globally necessary condition  of attaining intimacy with God. Rather, the proposal of divine intima- cy theodicy is that “perhaps, some occasions of suffering enable certain  individuals’ coming to love of and intimacy with God,” an intimacy  88.

It appears to be limited to quite rare cases  and perhaps to quite rare individuals, and to depend on the response of  the sufferer. YSA as divine intimacy theodicy should be understood as  including these qualifications on its scope, just as a plausible divine inti- macy theodicy will qualify its scope. This also suggests one reason why  YSA is a closer fit with divine intimacy theodicy than with soul-making  theodicies; a plausible divine intimacy theodicy is less global in its reach  and does not attempt to explain the suffering of all. A further objection is named by Ekstrom “the objection from  lunacy.”94 I think that it could be more accurately termed “the objection  from masochism.” The idea is that viewing suffering as a path to intimacy  with God seems easily to lead to an attitude that welcomes any suffer- ing that one may encounter, taking delight in it because of its supposed  spiritual benefits. Indeed, it appears able to lead smoothly to the deliber- ate infliction of suffering on oneself in order to attain closeness to God.  Ekstrom cites the example of the Cistercian nun Beatrice of Nazareth, who  is reported to have perceived suffering in this way and, inter alia, to have  scourged herself and slept on thorns.95 An interpretation of YSA as divine  intimacy theodicy appears open to the objection from masochism.96 The well-known episodes recounted near the end of the discussion  of YSA in Berakhot 5b constitute a powerful response to this objection.  The first of the three similar stories runs as follows: R. H. iyya b. Abba fell ill and R. Yoh.anan went in to visit him. He said to  him: Are your sufferings welcome to you? He replied: Neither they nor  their reward.  He said to him: Give me your hand. He gave him his hand  and he raised him. David Kraemer argues that these stories clearly legitimate protest against  YSA.97 But although Kraemer is correct that no justification of YSA is  93. Ibid.; emphases mine. 94.

Norman Lamm anticipates the linkage of YSA with  masochism: “The concept of yissurim shel ahavah, suffering in love, is not to be under- stood as a theological form of masochism or sadism” (Norman Lamm, Faith and  Doubt: Studies in Traditional Jewish Thought, [2nd ed., New York, 1986], 323). 97.

It is simply acknowledged that the pain being experienced is such  that it is legitimate to prefer not to suffer and not to reap the rewards of  suffering. The stories concede that the fact that God is just and the fact  that suffering is valuable and brings reward do not entail that it is not  religiously legitimate to want to avoid suffering. The human cost and  pain involved in suffering is fully acknowledged by the gemara, which  shows us that even three great sages reach a point where they want no  part of suffering. The gemara’s position appears to be that it is not just  that it is improper to masochistically inflict suffering on oneself but that  even ex post facto, once suffering has been visited by God, one need not  welcome it as an opportunity for intimacy with Him. It is fully legitimate  to reject both the suffering and the closeness to God that it facilitates.99 98. Marvin Fox argues that the series of negative answers of the sages in Berakhot 5b to  the question “are your sufferings welcome to you?” constitutes “forceful anti-theodicy  . . . [T]hey reject outright the theodicy of ‘sufferings of love’” (Marvin Fox, “Theodicy  and Anti-Theodicy in Biblical and Rabbinic Literature,” in Theodicy, ed. Dan Cohn- Sherbok [Jewish Studies Vol. 18] [Lewiston NY, 1997], 41). I suggest that the sages who  respond in the three episodes do accept YSA as a valid theodicy but themselves want  no part of suffering, even if the suffering is an expression of God’s love.  99. In a similar vein, though without commenting on whether or not the three episodes  constitute a rejection of YSA as a theodicy, R. Aharon Lichtenstein notes that “[a]t the  personal level . . . H. azal recognized that even the greatest very well might prefer to  forego both pain and its lucrative aftermath” (Lichtenstein, 46). He cites and translates  (ibid., 45) the following striking passage from Midrash Tehillim 6:3:  R. Yudan said in the name of R. Ammi: The congregation of Israel said to the  Holy One, blessed be He: “Lord of the Universe, even though the verse states,  ‘God chastises those whom He loves’ (Prov. 3:12)—‘Do not rebuke me in Your  anger’ (Ps. 6:2). Even though the verse states, ‘Blessed is the man whom God  chastises’ (Ps. 94:12)—‘Do not chastise me in Your fury’ (Ps. 6:2).”      See, however, Alshikh to Prov. 3:11, 10:16 and 10:17, where he states that one afflict- ed with YSA should not respond “neither they nor their reward.” In his commentary to  Lam. 3:27 he qualifies this and says that in old age, when one becomes weaker, “neither  they nor their reward” is a legitimate response. Maharsha to Berakhot 5b, s.v. h.avivin  alekha yissurin adops the same basic position as Alshikh. He ingeniously argues that  the sages in the three stories would not have responded “neither they nor their reward”  had their suffering been YSA. It was only because their suffering was so severe that it  was preventing them from studying Torah (and was hence by the Talmud’s own defi- nition, according to one opinion, not YSA) that they responded in this way. Maharal,  Netivot Olam, Netiv ha-Yissurin, ch. 1 (p. 430 in the Pardes edition) suggests that the  sages’ response “neither they nor their reward” was legitimate, but only because they  feared that they may not withstand the suffering and respond improperly as did Job.  Nevertheless, it does seem that the straightforward sense of the talmudic text sees little  wrong with the sages’ response. </page> <page sequence="25"> 88 The Torah u-Madda Journal Less Direct Forms of YSA as Divine Intimacy Theodicy There are further possibilities regarding exactly how the suffering visited  on a person in YSA might facilitate greater intimacy between God and  the sufferer. The connection between YSA and human intimacy with  the Divine is interestingly highlighted in the commentary of R. Moshe  Alshikh to Hosea 11:4. Alshikh states that there are two types of divine- ly-inflicted suffering (yissurin): those that are visited in response to sin  and those—which he defines as YSA—which are visited without sin but  in order “to atone for the generation.” (The idea here is vicarious atone- ment achieved for the community as a whole through the suffering of an  individual or individuals who is/are themselves without sin.100) Referring  to the imagery of ropes employed in the biblical verse, Alshikh goes on to  say that both types of suffering are means by which God draws the suffer- er closer to Himself. However, attending to the two different terms used  for “ropes” or “bonds” in the verse (h.avlei, the construct form of h.avalim,  and avotot), Alshikh states that avotot, which he takes to be referring to  YSA, are three times thicker and stronger than h.avalim, the term that  he understands to refer to punitive suffering. YSA’s are thus much more  effective than punitive suffering in “drawing towards and causing a person  to cleave to Him, may He be blessed.” In his commentary to Prov. 3:11,  Alshikh writes that through the YSA inflicted on the righteous person as  vicarious atonement for the sins of his or her contemporaries, “He [God]  will add to His love with which he loves Him a very intense love” and— no doubt taking his cue from the next verse, Prov. 3:12, “For whom the  Lord loves He corrects, like a father the son in whom he delights”—the  sufferer becomes a “child” of God rather than a mere “servant.”101 Alshikh  emphasises this in the concluding sentence of his commentary on this  verse: “Through yissurin shel ahavah the sufferer rises to exceeding love  from Him, may He be blessed, as a father loves a son, and this is stated  here in this verse [as Alshikh interprets it] to give a reason for yissurin  shel ahavah so that one not reject and refuse to accept them [the suffer- ings].” God’s paternal love for the sufferer of YSA is stressed again in his  commentary to the following verse.  What Alshikh presents here is YSA as a less direct kind of divine  intimacy theodicy than those kinds we have discussed thus far. By means  100. In his commentary to Hosea 14:6 and Prov. 3:11, Alshikh explicitly links YSA to  the notion of vicarious atonement.  101. Cf. Penei Yehoshua’s use of this theme in presenting a divine intimacy interpre- tation of YSA discussed above. The first part of Prov. 3:12, as we saw earlier, is quoted  near the beginning of the discussion of YSA in Berakhot 5a.  </page> <page sequence="26"> Michael J. Harris 89 of the sufferer vicariously atoning through YSA, he or she becomes more  beloved of God. The intimacy plays an important role here—Alshikh’s  great emphasis on it suggests that vicarious atonement is only a second- ary factor in justifying the suffering of the righteous innocent person.  His or her suffering is justified mainly because it brings him closer  to God; it is divine intimacy which is doing the work of theodicy, of  justification.102  A further form of YSA as a divine intimacy theodicy is more direct  than Alshikh’s but less direct than the Weil-type modes discussed earlier.  It returns us to the idea of YSA as purging of the soul, which we encoun- tered in our discussions of Nah.manides and Penei Yehoshua. This idea is  also important in the interpretations of YSA presented by R. Nissim of  Gerona (Ran) and Maharal, but in a different way. Ran states his view of YSA concisely in the tenth derashah of  Derashot ha-Ran.103 His conception of YSA is explicitly non-punitive.  The purpose of YSA is to distance the righteous person from material  matters and desires as far as possible. This appears to be the same kind  of soul-making theodicy as we encountered in Penei Yehoshua’s first  main interpretation of YSA. However, it is interesting that Ran uses the  language of divine intimacy at one point in his brief treatment of YSA.  He writes that it is impossible even in the case of a very righteous person  who does not sin “she-lo yatriduhu me‘at ta’avot ha-olam me-hiddav- ek be-Bore’o,” “that some this-worldly desires will not interfere with his  cleaving to his Creator.”104 While it appears that Ran’s main thrust in the  single paragraph he devotes to YSA in this derashah is soul-making, the  inclusion of the element of divine intimacy is perhaps significant. We come now to the position of Maharal. Maharal mentions YSA  in several places in his voluminous works, but his central discussion is  in Netivot Olam, Netiv ha-Yissurin, chapter 1. As noted above, Maharal  understands YSA as non-punitive. How, then, is it to be explained?  Maharal’s answer is that YSA is necessary to cleanse and purge the soul  of its attachment to the material so that it may attain the supreme spir- itual level. Once again, this sounds very close to the first main interpre- tation of Penei Yehoshua. But if we attend to the way in which Maharal  102. This distinguishes Alshikh’s position from Penei Yehoshua’s second main interpre- tation of YSA discussed earlier, in which vicarious atonement appears to play a much  more central role in justifying the suffering. 103. Derashot ha-Ran ha-Shalem im Perush Be’erot Moshe, ed. R. Aryeh Leib Feldman  (Jerusalem, 2003), 402-403.  104. Ibid.  </page> <page sequence="27"> 90 The Torah u-Madda Journal formulates this idea, it becomes clear that his position is substantially  different to that of Penei Yehoshua. Maharal writes: And they are called afflictions of love [yissurin shel ahavah] because God  loves him [the sufferer] and wishes to draw that person close to Him so  that he may cleave to Him, but the person has something preventing him  which is not fit to cleave to Him. Therefore God brings suffering upon him  to purge him so that he is fit to cleave, and therefore they are called afflic- tions of love. The [correct] interpretation [of YSA] is not that because of  love He inflicts suffering on him, which would certainly be inappropriate,  but that God loves and desires him and therefore wishes to bring him close  to Him, but the person has not attained this level, and so God purges the  material blemish in him so that he is fit to cleave [to God].105 It is clear from this passage that the purging and improvement of the  soul accomplished by YSA is not the real purpose of the afflictions but  rather only a means, albeit a necessary means, to an end. That end, as  repeatedly emphasized in the passage, is closeness to, cleaving to, intima- cy with God in this world. While the idea of YSA as the purging of the  soul makes the position of Maharal initially seem close to that of Penei  Yehoshua, then, a careful reading of Chapter 1 of Netiv ha-Yissurin yields  the conclusion that Maharal reads YSA as a divine intimacy theodicy  rather than as a kind of soul-making theodicy, as if taking up the hint in  Ran’s treatment of YSA but going much further with it. A little further  on, Maharal emphasizes the real purpose of YSA from his perspective:  “The Holy One desires him, to bring him to Him so that he is close to  Him.”106 Indeed, Maharal stresses throughout this chapter the theme of  closeness to God and YSA as a means to it.107 What Maharal presents in  Netivot Olam is a divine intimacy theodicy: what justifies the suffering  is the achievement of closeness to God in the here-and-now. Of course,  one could argue that greater closeness to God is itself an improvement  of the soul. But Maharal’s emphasis on the attainment of intimacy with  God in this world makes his position a divine intimacy rather than  soul-making theodicy. That emphasis also emerges in chapter 1 of Netiv Ha-Yissurin in his  explanation of one of the differences of opinion in the Berakhot discus- sion of YSA. According to one opinion in the gemara, any suffering  that causes bittul Torah, the negation of Torah study, cannot constitute  105. Netivot Olam, ed. Pardes, vol. 2, p. 427; emphases mine.  106. Ibid., 428. 107. In Netiv ha-Yissurin ch. 2 (ibid., 433-34), the idea of YSA as a means to closeness  with God is underlined yet again. </page> <page sequence="28"> Michael J. Harris 91 YSA. According to a second opinion, any suffering that causes one to be  unable to pray cannot constitute YSA. Maharal explains the first opinion  thus: since Torah study is the best way of cleaving to God, suffering that  causes distancing from God through inability to study cannot be YSA.  Similarly, according to the second opinion, prayer is the quintessential  method of achieving closeness to God, and so suffering which prevents  the attainment of this intimacy cannot be YSA. The dispute between the  two opinions focuses on whether Torah study or prayer is the optimum  tool for achieving intimacy with the divine, but “both agree that yissurin  shel ahavah cannot involve distance and separation from God.”108 In articulating the need for willing acceptance by the sufferer of  YSA, emphasized as we have seen in the Berakhot sugya and Alshikh as  constitutive of YSA and crucial to the idea of intimacy, Maharal once  again underscores the central role of intimacy with God in the here-and- now: “He [the sufferer] needs to accept them [the afflictions] in love, for  if he does not accept them in love he does not cleave to Him, and how  then will these be yissurin shel ahavah?”109  6. Conclusion The central argument of this paper has been that divine intimacy  theodicy is the option in contemporary philosophy of religion that is  most fruitful to consider in connection with YSA. We have surveyed a  number of ways in which YSA might be interpreted as a divine inti- macy theodicy and have argued that these are identifiable in talmu- dic or important later sources. Moreover, the idea that suffering can  be productive of intimacy with God is, we have seen, found in Jewish  sources even independently of YSA. And even if divine intimacy theo- dicy is construed in its more radical mode as involving the idea that  God can suffer, this idea is far from an alien one in important strands  of Jewish tradition. It would seem that divine intimacy theodicy is  not just an interesting notion for Christian thinkers but is worthy of  108. Netivot Olam, ed. Pardes, vol. 2, 428.  109. Ibid. Maharal here seems to support my reading of Berakhot 5a as opposed to  the Schottenstein edition’s; see n. 72 above. Maharal implicitly (or perhaps explicitly)  suggests here—as others, e.g. R. Yosef Albo, sometimes do in their discussions of YSA  —that ahavah in the phrase yissurin shel ahavah can be taken as referring to the love  of the sufferer for God as well as God’s love for the sufferer. If YSA is read as any of  the kinds of divine intimacy theodicy discussed in Section 5 of this article, the term  ahavah in yissurin shel ahavah could similarly be interpreted not only as God’s love  for the sufferer, but as the love of the sufferer for God, which is elevated to a new level. </page> <page sequence="29"> 92 The Torah u-Madda Journal consideration as part of a traditional Jewish theological approach to the  problem of suffering, particularly in relation to the doctrine of YSA. None of this is to deny that the talmudic sugya in which the concept  of YSA is primarily embedded is far away from the formal presentation  and categorisation of theodicies. As Louis Jacobs notes, in the Berakhot  5a-5b sugya “we are far removed from anything like a systematic treat- ment by the Rabbis of the theological problem of suffering.”110 It is a  commonplace that H. azal generally eschewed systematic theological  discussion. Perhaps that is a particular strength when it comes to the  problem of suffering; many have argued for the inappropriateness and  even callousness of attempting to deal with the complexities of this  topic in a series of neat analytic propositions. Others disagree: John  Hick urges that “to erect a general embargo upon the reasoned consid- eration of sin and suffering would be to abandon the vocation of philos- opher or theologian.”111 In a sentence which mentions together the two  central concepts which have been the focus of this essay, R. Norman  Lamm writes: “The theme of suffering, like that of love, is poorly served  by normal theological discourse precisely because it is so central to  and so massively problematical for the whole enterprise of religion.”112  He suggests that “[l]iterature, with its liberal recourse to symbols and  layered meanings and nuanced situations, is better equipped to explore  and suggest and probe this most potent of all questions.”113 Those who  find systematic philosophical or theological treatment of suffering ulti- mately inadequate may well feel that the non-systematic nature of the  Berakhot YSA sugya and, like so many aggadic sugyot, its ability to strad- dle the border between theology and literature so effectively, enable it to  combine open-endedness, deep insight, and an awareness of the ambi- guities inherent in this most challenging area.
