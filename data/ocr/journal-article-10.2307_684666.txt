Steinberg1 Social Movements: A Cognitive Perspective. Ron Eyerman and Andrew Jamison. Oxford: Polity Press, 1991. Ideology and Social Movements. Alan Scott. London: Unwin Hyman, 1990. It is commonplace to say that we live in a global village in which knowledge is instantaneously shared. If so, then social movement theorists are its squatters, mostly living on the margins. Despite active agendas on both sides of the Atlantic, American and European scholars have only re- cently begun to critically appraise and appropriate each other's work, par- ticularly on issues of new social movements.2 High on the agenda must be the integration of European concentration on ideology and consciousness with the American focus on organization and instrumentalism Two recent volumes provide both some measured optimism and continued concern about the squatters' abilities to share theoretical concerns and become per- manent dwellers. In Eyerman and Jamison's Social Movements: A Cognitive Perspective, readers will find themselves in the thick of the shanties. The authors are concerned not with movement origins or mobilization, but with how they function to open up new public spaces for novel collective identities and ideas. They broadly align themselves with Alberto Melucci and other Euro- pean theorists who view social movements (SMs) as producers of collective identities; their theory, however, is largely an elaboration upon Habermas's work on knowledge interests. Social movements are analyzed as transitory 'Department of Sociology, Clark University, 950 Main Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01610-1477. 2A recent rendition of the Euro-American rift and possible synthesis can be found in Klandermans and Tarrow (1988). 551 0884-8971/92/0900-0551$06.50/0 ? 1992 Plenum Publishing Corporation</page><page sequence="2">social actors engaged in innovative cognitive praxis. In their hermeneutic perspective they define three levels of this process: (a) the cosmological, in which worldviews are defined, and the historical meaning and utopian mission of the SM are articulated; (b) the technological, the technico-prac- tical agenda and means of action that SMs develop; and (c) the organiza- tional, the means by which knowledge production is coordinated and disseminated. SMs are characterized as most vital when they seek to transform es- tablished social and political boundaries. In doing so they generate cos- mologies that guide movement activists, producing a new collective consciousness. The products of this praxis are not found in the heads of SM activists and participants, but in the texts which the movement, as a collective actor, creates. The power of SMs wanes when praxis becomes ossified within permanent organizations, and movement activists are incor- porated into the existing power structure. Eyerman and Jamison depart from the European paradigm when they argue that this praxis is the defining characteristic of all movements. Using the early 19th-century English working-class (Owenism and Chartism), U.S. civil rights, and contemporary environmental movements as empirical touchstones, they show commonalties in the cycles of praxis found in each. All opened new vistas of knowledge and produced new collective identities. All were eventually eclipsed through institutionalization and the professionalization of SM intellectuals. New SMs (NSMs) are differentiated from earlier movements by the historical conditions within which praxis occurs. In contrast to Eyerman and Jamison, Alan Scott in Ideology and Social Movements provides us with a look at the new village denizen. Much of the work is a running critique of SM theory, encompassing both European and American standards and centering on the blind spots each group has for the other's theoretical concerns. The most novel (and welcome) part of this criticism is directed at the European NSM literature. Scott analytically and empirically dissects its claims, using the environmental movement as a critical test. He demonstrates that NSMs are as expressly concerned with institutional politics and power as they are with collective identity and culture, that organization and resources are as critical as ideology and lifestyle, and that NSMs are prey to the same problems of sectarianism and co-optation as their forebears.3 Along the way he also 3In this regard Scott mirrors recent empirical work and criticism on European NSMs such as that by Dieter Rucht (1989) and Wolfgang Rudig (Rudig, 1988; Lowe and Rudig, 1986) and the theoretical and political writing such as Gunderlach (1989), Plotke (1990), and Gamson (1991). For a somewhat dilfcrent macrotheory focusing on the links between cultural processes and national political agenda setting, see Joppke (1991). 552 Steinberg</page><page sequence="3">Recent Social Movement Theory takes Resource Mobilization theory (in the guise of Olson) to task for its instrumentalist emphasis. Scott's contribution is a cross-Atlantic synthesis accomplished through neo-Weberian theory. He argues that SM theory must have com- plementary cultural and purposive models that integrate concerns of col- lective identity, ideology, and interest formulation with those of organization strategy and resource mobilization. He links the two through Parkin's theory of social closure, suggesting that conflicts of exclusion/in- clusion bear on both the cultural and political dynamics of SMs. In the case of the environmental movement, Scott offers the intriguing analysis that neocorporatist political arrangements have excluded portions of the (youthful) middle class who have high cultural and educational capital, but few channels for effectively mobilizing these resources for institutional political voice. The result is both a collective identity as outsiders and a demand for inclusion in the polity.4 Reading these two volumes thus is an exercise in contrasts, with Scott's treatise emerging as the clearly superior offering. Where Eyerman and Jamison offer a disturbingly inaccurate summary of SM theory (par- ticularly the American literature), Scott offers careful and wide-ranging syn- opsis and critique (albeit a bit retreaded). Eyerman and Jamison's analyses of the 19th-century working-class and 20th-century civil rights movements are replete with historical inaccuracies and claims that will make experts in these areas wince. Scott's parallel discussions are more carefully empiri- cally grounded and analytically judicious. The ultimate divide, however, is found in matters of theoretical logic. Eyerman and Jamison's argument cracks from the tension of its contradic- tory propositions and the weight of its ambiguities. They assert that SMs are fundamentally cultural processes of knowledge creation and identity (55), yet also maintain that SMs originate in disputes over political bounda- ries (150). Political and cultural dynamics are never integrated. Movements themselves take on anthropomorphic qualities. While SMs are collective actions of cognitive praxis, the ideas and identities are transcendentally pro- vided to activists (the SM's intellectuals), for "it is movements as cognitive praxis, that lead and direct intellectuals rather than intellectuals that lead and direct movements" (99). The origins of quintessential knowledge in- terests and the reasons for the development of new collective identities remain remarkably oblique. Scott, however, offers a coherent, if sketchy, plan for synthesis. By explicitly linking issues of cultural production to political and economic 4Scott's theory could be used to put a more explicitly political interpretation of the new class thesis such as in Kriesi (1989). 553</page><page sequence="4">fissure, he provides a means of including the dynamics of collective consciousness and identity in political process and resource mobilization models. Scott too suffers from a lack of appreciation of American theories (for example, his social closure innovation seems remarkably parallel to Tilly's [1978] polity model), and he lacks specificity in linking cultural processes to consensus mobilization, organizational dynamics, and action repertoires. However, on the whole this does not diminish his contribution toward a working synthesis. Scott's formulations call attention to our need to systematically link the cultural and the ideological with the material and the utilitarian in a single purposive model. There must be mutual recognition by both the European and American perspectives of their contributions and deficiencies for a syn- thesis to gel. First, those disposed to the European model need to acknow- ledge that cultural constructs are in part the result of collective action which is explicitly political. Identities, ideologies, and lifestyles clearly are structured in political conflict and in relation to another group's domination. Second, those favoring American approaches must recognize that the collective action process is culturally mediated. Issues for mobilization, statements of purpose and grievance, and the formulation of repertoires and goals are all collectively constructed and organized through ideological frameworks that provide SM participants and their activities with legitimacy.5 One possible path toward integration is to analyze the discursive processes through which collectivities construct ideological frameworks for contention, and how they may reorganize or transform them during collective action.6 Discourse is a collective process of meaning production that occurs in tandem with other forms of SM activity. In consensus mobilization, action mobilization and conflict SM groups must have a discursive repertoire paralleling their action repertoire that helps structure identity, confers legitimacy and efficacy, and serves as a medium for strategic considerations on goals and tactics (Steinberg, 1991a,b). The analysis of movement discourse provides a means to study the collective construction of identities and moral frameworks throughout the entire cycle 5Craig Calhoun (1991) has recently raised the issue of identity construction in his analysis of the Chinese students' campaign for democratization. While Calhoun's discussion of the problem is noteworthy, he seems to accept that certain cultural notions (such as that of honor) are nonproblematic features of Chinese society, and thus fails to fully theorize identity construction as a political process. 6Several American scholars have made valuable contributions in this regard. David Snow and his colleagues have elaborated a model of ideological framing in SM activity, and William Gamson and his associates have also demonstrated how political issues are framed for public debate (Gamson, 1988; Gamson and Modigliani, 1987, 1989; Snow et al. 1986; Snow and Benford, 1988). These contributions on framing, however, fall short of providing a fully dynamic perspective on the role of discourse throughout the entire mobilization and action cycle (Steinberg, 1991b). 554 Steinberg</page><page sequence="5">Recent Social Movement Theory of SM mobilization and conflict, integrating the cultural and political in a dynamic purposive model. In sum, there is some hope that we squatters can take these new materials, and build more permanent and sturdy structures. Perhaps some- day we may move beyond the tentative process of communication and mu- tual recognition, and get on with the business of establishing firm rules for cohabitation.
