      <p>Over the last two decades scholars of English Reformation visual culture have made efforts to demolish Patrick Collinson’s influential claim that England witnessed a shift from iconoclasm to iconophobia in the late sixteenth century. Inaugurated by the publication of Tessa Watt’s <italic>Cheap Print and Popular Piety</italic> in 1991, this movement to provide a more complex account of the period’s reformed attitude toward images has led to a wide range of exciting work focused on everything from graffiti to ephemeral print, textile production, and book illustration. It is this last category that provides the majority of the subject matter for David Davis in <italic>Seeing Faith, Printing Pictures</italic>, the latest installment of the Brill series Library of the Written Word. Asserting that Watt’s study “dismantled Collinson’s iconophobia thesis,” Davis promises to “offer a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between religion and visual imagery, demonstrating that images served Protestant and Catholic alike in many significant, albeit different, ways” (9–10). This is an exciting promise, similar to that offered recently by Tara Hamling and Richard Williams in their collection <italic>Art Re-Formed: Reassessing the Impact of the Reformation on the Visual Arts</italic> (2008).</p>
      <p>While Hamling and Williams address the visual arts broadly speaking, Davis’s study is focused more narrowly on the relationship between printed pictures and “religious identity,” a category he hopes will offer insight beyond that which can be gleaned from studies of more-rigid categories such as religious doctrine or ecclesiastical law. The goal is to “present a study of the Reformation that is not graphed along strict confessional or ideological lines that are either Protestant or Catholic” (7). This is a welcome approach that builds on recent work on religious belief in the English Reformation that has revealed the complex and multifaceted nature of early modern English religious feeling, especially that which has emphasized the importance of recusant Catholics.</p>
      <p>Davis’s first two chapters provide a solid summary of the material conditions affecting early modern printing in England and the sixteenth-century religious debates over image use, respectively. Both chapters address relevant evidence concerning sixteenth-century English images, concluding that material conditions and a diversity of religious opinion hampered the development of English illustration in the sixteenth century. While this is not a particularly new conclusion, the account of the development of printing and its relationship to religious debates is compelling.</p>
      <p>Chapter 3 offers background on printed images in the Catholic tradition and its legacy for visual print culture in the Reformation. Despite the assertion that features of Catholic illustration persisted into the Reformation, most of Davis’s examples in this chapter are from the 1540s and 1550s, well before the supposed iconophobic turn. John King and others have long established that early Reformers, such as John Bale and the Protestant printer John Day, adapted Catholic representational practices to their own ends. More compelling, perhaps, is Davis’s discussion of clandestine Catholic presses and Continental imports as evidence of the continued importance of a Catholic visual culture in Reformation England, though it is difficult not to suspect that the exceptions here prove the rule.</p>
      <p>Having discussed the general context of religious printed images, Davis devotes the remaining chapters to specific kinds of images printed and circulated through the end of the sixteenth century: images of Christ, God the Father, and symbolic representations of the godhead. These chapters are the strongest in the book, shedding light on some important shifts in both reformed and recusant visual culture. Chapter 4 examines representations of Christ in relation to the <italic>imitatio Christi</italic> tradition, tracing the ways in which Protestant printers retained or revised images to stress the lesson that good Christians should model themselves after Christ. The next chapter’s discussion of images of God the Father traces earlier Catholic depictions of the Father as they were adapted to Reformation print culture. The discussion here is fascinating, though the story Davis tells seems to confirm rather than refute Collinson’s thesis that there was a significant shift around 1580 concerning the use of images. As the majority of Davis’s examples predate this cutoff, the thrust of his argument is less a demolition of Collinson’s thesis than a subtle revision.</p>
      <p>The final chapter, perhaps the strongest in the study, further confirms the argument for a shift, as it tracks the transformation of anthropomorphic images of God primarily in pre- and early Reformation books into increasingly abstracted symbols such as the sword, the holy monogram (difficult to associate with the Reformation due to its use by the Jesuits), and the Tetragrammaton. Davis is right to highlight the continued use of symbolic representations of God in the Reformation, but in doing so he tends to blur the line between word and image. Nevertheless, this book brings together important evidence that the desire for visual images continued into the Reformation at the very moment that the role of visual material in England’s religious culture was undergoing a significant transformation.</p>
