When critics explore the work of the American poet Theodore Roethke, it is often in conjunction with other poets. Roethke was not a prolific writer, in the manner, say, of Wallace Stevens or Robert Frost, and this may explain in part why so few book-length studies are devoted to his work. Among the most illuminating of these are Richard Blessing's Theodore Roethke's Dynamic Vision (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1974), Rosemary Sullivan's Theodore Roethke. The Garden Master (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1975), Jenijoy La Belle's The Echoing Wood of Theodore Roethke (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1976), and Jay Parini's Theodore Roethke: An American Romantic (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1979). Lynn Ross-Bryant has recently added another title to this list. Her study is quite different from the others, however, in the sense that she focuses explicitly on the religious implications of Roethke's work. Ross-Bryant's interdisciplinary approach is bound to raise the question of the delicate relations between religion and literature. She does not regard Roethke as formally a religious thinker, yet she expounds his work in the light of such thinkers as Buber, Marcel, and Teilhard. One sometimes feels that there are so many allusions to names and theories that the presence of the poet himself is obscured. Nevertheless, the author's learning serves her well when she turns to a practical reading of the poetry itself. For here she draws judiciously not only on literary critics but also on her "visionary company" of selected thinkers to explicate some of Roethke's darkest passages. Admittedly, in a thematic study it is not incumbent on the critic to discuss every poem in a writer's canon. It is helpful for the critic to explain, however, why some poems are chosen for discussion rather than others. This explanation is lacking in Ross-Bryant's study. She acknowledges that in the case of Roethke it "is necessary to see many poems as parts of sequences" (p. 9). Yet, with two exceptions-"Meditations of an Old Woman" and "North American Sequence"- she does not deal with Roethke's poems in their sequential integrity. Be that as it may, a rather loosely defined organizing principle does govern her treatment of the poetry. A quotation from a theologian whom the critic herself cites may serve to establish the pattern of religious meaning that she discerns in Roethke's work. Joseph Sittler writes: "Because men exist and are as relational entities, only a redemption among can be a real redemption. Only, that is to say, when the meaning and act of redemption is within the web of creation can a salvable identity be 'saved' in any sense that makes sense. It is only in such a self-world context that I have a body, a mind, a memory, a spirit, expectation, response. What and who might be a person apart from this web? A no-thing" (Joseph Sittler, Essays on Nature and Grace [Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1972], p. 111). In Ross-Bryant's interpretation of Roethke, a "relational" understanding of existence is a main hallmark of the poet's art. Gradually and intuitively, she maintains, he came to see "the unique living things of the universe...as sharing in a process of interrelationships that bind not only human beings but all life together" (p. 192). The aims of this study go beyond a thoughtful exposition of a poet's work, for the author seems consciously to write from a theological agenda. The purpose of this agenda is to urge us "beyond the anthropomorphism that has 128</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews dominated Western culture" (p. 194). In Ross-Bryant's view, Roethke presents not only a religious vision of life but also a way of being religious in life. NORMAN CHANEY, Otterbein College. LEVINE, DANIEL H. Religion and Politics in Latin America. The Catholic Church in Venezuela and Colombia. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1981. xii+342 pp. $22.50 (cloth); $6.95 (paper). For many years the Roman Catholic church has been considered a major obstacle to change in the social and political arena in Latin America and else- where, but in the years since Vatican II, and especially since the CELAM Conference at Medellin in 1968, the church has been seen more as an agent of change. Daniel H. Levine, as a political scientist, has been interested in insti- tutional change in Latin America (see his Conflict and Political Change in Venezuela [Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1973]) but has come to realize that the part played by the Roman Catholic church in social and political change can be understood only if one understands the images and visions of the church itself as seen through the eyes of its leaders. Hence, the book is (as the author remarks) akin to a study in the sociology of knowledge "with an interest in the interplay between concepts and forms of action, their social and institutional settings, and forms of social and political action" (p. 14). Levine begins with a sensitive description of the changes which have occurred within the church itself and the impact these have had on the way the church acts in the social and political realms. One of his key insights is that the notion of "pastoral action" has expanded considerably beyond the traditional notions of visiting the sick and imprisoned and caring for the widow and the orphan to include "denunciation of those social conditions which make a fully human and moral life impossible, such as extreme poverty and oppression" (p. 25). At the same time, the notion of "politics" has also been broadened to include similar denunciations and massive community actions. Both have become considerably more amorphous and difficult to delineate clearly. Hence, the issue of religion and politics is no longer couched in terms of church-state conflicts, but rather in terms of the motivation religion provides for radical action and the way it functions as a shield for dissent in authoritar- ian regimes. Liberation theology has been a stimulus for both of these functions. Levine does a fine job of providing the necessary historical, social, and ecclesiastical background on both Venezuela and Colombia and of employing social science techniques to collect data at various levels. Between 1971 and 1973, the author conducted structured interviews with the entire hierarchies of the two countries as well as with a large number of leaders in church bureau- cracies and religious orders. On the more local level, he selected three dioceses from each country, and then three parishes from each diocese, for more inten- sive analysis. In addition to this concretization the comparative analysis between the two countries is also helpful. After a thorough presentation of his data on the bishops, including both statistics and personal interviews, Levine concludes that the most important change since Vatican II, according to the bishops from both countries, is in 129</page></plain_text>
