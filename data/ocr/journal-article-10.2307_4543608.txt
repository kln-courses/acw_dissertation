<plain_text><page sequence="1">46 J:. J. HYLE. SYMPOSIUM-IS RELIGION PRE-SUPPOSED BY MORALITY, OR MORA.LITY BY RELIGION? I.-By R. J. RYLE. INASMUCH as this question may be understood in several distinct senses, I should like to explain the meaning which I take it to have for the parposes of our present investigation. The word Religion is used, as Professor Max Muller has pointed out, with at least three different significations. Sometimes the word stands for the object of belief; sometimes it means the power of belief or attitude of mind of the religious believer; and sometimes again it means the manifestation of belief whether in acts of worship or piety. Now as I anderstaud the question before us we are not here con- cerned with the object or objects of belief, but with the fact that there is a certain kincd of belief, or that there exists a certain power or faculty of belief which manifests itself in certain particular acts. To explain my meaning by example. It was maintained by Kant that only crude and vague conceptions of the Deity, or indifference with regard to the Deity were alone possible till a certain refinement of moral concepts had been attained, and that finally a concept of the Deity was elaborated which we hold to be correct, not because speculative reason has sbown it to be so, but because of its harmony with the moral principles of reason. Here two entirely different problems are touched. The first problem is concerned with the question how far the development of Moral Concepts has been a factor in bringing about consistent and distinct religious beliefs; and the second problem is, whether the correctness of a religious belief is to be held to be established by its agreement with what are called the motal principles of reason. Now as I understand oar question, we have not to consider whether morality (in the sense of moral prin. ciples) does or does not establish the correctness of, or warrant our belief in, certain doctrines of religion. What we have to consider is rather whether Morality, regarded as that kind of conduct whiCh typically implies the significant conception conveyed by the word " ought," pre-supposes the presence in the human mind of a certain kind of belief or attitude of mind expressed by the word Religion. If I am right in taking this view of the meaning of our q-uestion, our inquiry is in the main an empirical or psychological one. If I am wrong in thinking that our quarry is to be caught in such a net, I am glad to feel that I have to follow me two equally earnest hunters wvho may catch what I miss. Nor can I leave out of sight the</page><page sequence="2">MORALITY AND RELIGION. 47 possibility that to the eye of some who look down upon this chase from a great height, the phrase "pre-supposition " may seem in- applicable. Possibly there may be a point of view from which Religion and Morality may be regarded as parallel manifestations of a single spiritual impualse, or there may be a land of promise in which they are one. But with these glimpses I am not here concerned; neither can I further our pursuit by aid of a preliminary definition; nor yet can I undertake to decide between the various accounts which anthro- pologists have to offer of the historical rise of Religion and Morality among men. It may be that ancestor worship, or the visions of the night, or a spontaneous tendency to see our minds in the world of things outside us, has been chiefly at work; but -by one means or other the recogni- tion of spirit or intelligence other than ours has become a prominent feature of most religions, and so far as this is so there seems to be reason for holding that Religion pre-supposes Morality. Suppose I pick up a shell on the sea-shore, and allow myself to wander into a long, chain of reflections. I think of the Mollusk which inhabited it, of the vital processes carried on in the lifetime of the animal, of the processes of secretio5n and growth, of which this shell remains the monument, and of the long course of zoological and geological history which the shell represents. Such thoughts lie all within the domain of natural science. They may be appropriated to other uses. A Lucretius or a Tennyson mig,ht weave them into a philosophy of the Universe, which should combine the severity of science and the earnestness of the moral teacher in one sublime poem. In themselves, however, they are bare details of facts and events. But my thoughts may take a different turn. I may remind myself that I am dealing with what is called an organism. As such it exhibited certain noteworthy adaptations in structure ancd function which distinguish such an object from a block of stone. It may have been developed, biologically speaking, out of some less elaborate form of life; but only organic forms admit of organic development; and the characters of adjustment of part to part, and of the whole to its place in the world remind me of such mechanisms as a watch is, or of such objects as I know to be the product of human design. Hence I am led on to imagrine a factor which my previous series of thoughts had not included, and to attribute to this factor powers of a piece with those of hnman intellig,ence in quality, though not in other respects comparable with them. I have now passed quite out of the region of Natural Science. But have I passed into that of Religion ? At first sight one is</page><page sequence="3">48 R. J. RYLL inclined to say, Yes. But has the simple conception of mind as operative in the Universe ever constituted Religion either for indi- viduals or nations When we meet with it in confessedlv religious writings it is always as a doctrine, important metaphysically it may be, but to us human beings, of interest only if it can be shown to imply the co-existence with Intelligence of Character. Here, then, lies the significance of that speculation. When we substitute for, or interpolate among our biological data the conception of Design, then, whatever else we have done, we have replaced the conception of events by the conception of action. When once this conception has arisen, the road is open for further additions and refinement; and, to all but the Metaphysician (who may be conscious of difficulties which have no being for the general heart of man) theologr by a very natural step becomes religion. This step is the association of the conception of an agent with all those emotions of approval, disapproval, love and batred which we do not apply to events, and do readily apply to actions. -'Will and design," in Bishop Butler's words, " constitute the very nature of actions as such, to our perception they are the object and the only one of the approving and disapproving faculty." The simplest savage, in so far as he does not view the world as a series of events merely to be sought or shunned, but as the scene of actions no matter whether attributed to good or bad, to embodied or disembodied spirits-places himself in a position in which he would be more than human if he were to stop at this point. From his earliest infancy, the fact that actions are things bidden or forbidden, praiseworthy or the reverse, has been as familiar as is the fact that they are the deeds of persons like himself. Indeed it may well be doubted whether anyone but a philosopher would be troubled (as Aristotle is in Ihis Ethics) with scruples as to the complete applicability of the character of human actions to the actions of the gods. Religion, in short, is not, so long as its theology remains limited to the recognition of Intelligence in the world; and it cannot remain limited because man the specalator is also man the social being, whose life involves moral relations, and more or less crudely, some conception of moral relations wherever he is man at all. In this sense Religion pre-supposes Morality. Without Morality there may be a metaphysic or a philosophy of things, but not religion. And the fact that the true relation of Religion and Morality are expressed in this description appears quite as much when we examine the changes which take place in the religion and morality of man as when we examine the implication of that central concep- tion of mind in the world which we have just left. In the words of Professor Jowett: "As in the religion of Greece in the age of Plato,</page><page sequence="4">MORALITY AND RELIGION. 49 so in all religions, the cousideration of their morality comes first, afterwards the truthi of the documents or of the events natural or supernatural which are told of them." In other words, to the unreflecting propounders of the earliest religious beliefs, these beliefs are not unrelated to the morality of the time and place. To the scrutiny of the philosophic moralist as time goes on it appears that they no longer reflect and sanction morality, but immorality. They must be chango-ed. Where the beliefs merely relate to biographical details, and poetical fancies, the Pantheon may stand, but wheresoever the interest of Morality is involved this- must lead and the rest may follow, or die out, or pass over into the realm of poetry and out of that of history. In this light we may regard the reformation, which Socrates and Plato started by " moral considerations," the current of which may he followed down to the days of the later Roman Stoics. Another instructive example may be found in the rise and spread of Buddhisni, a belief or attitade of belief which pre-supp)osed morality indeed, buit which went even further than Stoicism in its repudiation of the world without, and its reliance upon the world within; in conmplete independence of current, social, and ceremonial order, and of current relig,ious beliefs and ceremionies. The opposite view to the one here advocated, viz., the view that Morality pre-supposes Religion, is based, I believe, upon a confusion which language renders almost unavoidable-I mean the confusion of the actual morality of uan as a fact with man's carrent conceptions of this morality. Let me illustrate this confusion by quoting a few sentences from Professor Caird's lectures on the Evolution of Religion, without how- ever wishing to assert that Professor Caird was not alive to the distinction I wish to emphasise. Hie says, " Man's relation to God is inevitably conceived as the ground of a social relation between himself anld beings like bimself, which determines at once their practical oblig,ations to him, and his practical obligations to them." Again, "As he conceives of his relations to the power which determines his place in the world, and especially his place in relation to other men, so also he conceives of the duty which he owes to them." Now this is no doubt a true accou-nt of the way in which man represents to himself, or conceives of his duty toward his neighbour, when he has reached a stage of intellectual advancement adequate to the formationl of Moral ideas; but morality in fact precedes morality in theory no less thani astronomical fazts precede astronomical prin- ciples. And we have only to ask the quiestion, " Whence does man derive his conceptioiis of his relations to God ? " in order to see that D</page><page sequence="5">50 R. J. HYLE. these conceptions pre-suppose morlity in practice. They may be described from either of two sides. We may speak of man's concep- tion of his relation toward God, or of his conception of God's relation toward himself. From the side of man we must explicitly or implicitly admit the principle implied in the words, " He that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen ? " And if we ask for the source of man's conceptions of the attitude of his God, or God's toward man, we must answer in words which are to the same effect. The saint whose claims are most strenaous that God's dealings with him are a portion of his own personal experience, will admit that the approving and disapproving Spirit whose admonitions he apprehends, is active also in the world around, and he can form no image of such a Being, or of such action without. fixing his eyes upon such works of truth, justice, or love, as he can recognise in the history of mankind. If, as the late Professor Green writes, "God is to be conceived as the Being with whom the human spirit is identical, in the sense that He is all which the human spirit is capable of becoming," still the fact remains (as he goes on to shew in discussing the Moral Ideal and Moral Progress) that only by redection or that which he has done and has become,, does man come to be more fully aware of what he has it in him to do. and to become. Thus Religion pre-supposes Morality wherever, even in its crudest forms, it dwells on actions as distinct from events. It pre-supposes Morality also in the process of its development, whether by way, of gradual growth, or by reformation, and it pre-supposes Morality yet more explicitly, as the formulation of ethical tbeory and of the expression of religious belief become more the work of philosphical criticism, and less the work of the uncritical multitude of mankind. II.-By C. C. J. WEBB. Mr. Ryle observes very traly that the question propounded for discussion in this Symposium has several distinct senses. He chooses one of these for his own treatment of the matter, and enquires only whether the state of mind we call Religion pre-supposes moral con- ceptions or no. By usin, the word "moral " in a wide sense, he avoids conflict with historical facts revealing to us stages of religious development in which Religion is held to sanction or require conduct to our apprehension highly immoral: he decidies that Religion pre- supposes Morality, understanding by this phrase that Religion is fundamentally anthropomorphic, making God in the likeness of man, and therefore moral. Here I am wholly at one with Mr. Ryle.</page><page sequence="6">MORALITY ASID RELIGION. 51 But for myself I would take a somewhat different line of tbought. In philosophy words like "pre-suppose," which contain a note of time, are apt to be ambiguous. The difference between the two orders of krnowledge - the relative order, the order of human discovery, on the one hand, and the absolute order, the order of natural reality, on the other, is familiar and well established. Oar answers to the quaestion before us will, I think, differ, according as we think of one or the other of these orders. Again, phrases like those embodied in our question, are wont to carry with them associations, which extend beyond the literal meaning of their constitnent words. When one hears it said that Morality pre-supposes Religion, one is inclined to think of systems in which moral distinc- tions are supposed to depend on the arbitrary will or appointment of the Deity, and ethical convictions, not definitely grounded on religious dogma, despised. On the other hand, when it is said that Religion pre-supposes Murbiy, one perhaps thinks of such a movement as that to which the now numerous "ethical societies" of this country, of America, and of Germany, owe their origin. The supporters of these often tend to assume the possibility of an entire severance between Morality and theism in any form, and to speak of positive Religion as if it were but a graceful form, in which indeed the habits of certain persons lead them to clothe their etbical emotions, but with which those of a different temperament may very well dispense. With the former type of opinion I have no sympathy at all. To make " Revealed Religion " in any shape the pre-supposition of Morality is an impossible task. " Ante anima," says Tertullian very well, "quam prophetia " (Contra Marc, i, 10). To base theology upon the "rational " proofs without the moral (as must be done, unless, indeed, we allow ourselves a manifest petitio principii, if "natural " Religion be made the pre-supposition of Morality) is perversely to prefer the less persuasive to the more persuasive topics in our argument. To assert that Morality pre-supposes Religion in any such sense as this is to run counter to the best traditions, not only of moral philosophy, but of Christian theology. Witb the second type of opinion I have much sy-mpathy, so far as it represents a reaction from an opposite and less amiable e:xtreme: for though comparatively few professed moralists may have made Morality depends for its sanction on Religion, religious persons are apt to hold some such view, though vaguely, and without analysis. But I cannot sympathise whole-heartedly in a movement which would ascribe to theism the inessential and merely ornamental place which it seems to hold, at the best, in the programmes of " ethical societies." In my view, Morality pre-supposes Religion, much as in the D 2</page><page sequence="7">50 C. C. J. WEBB. Kantian philosophy the moral law may be said to pre-snppose tbe " postulates of the practical reason." We do not recognise the authority of the moral law, in consequence of our belief in these; hut the intrinsic unconditional authority of the moral law appealing, irresistibly to the conscience, leads us to believe in whatever the presence of thi.s Categorical Imperative within as is found on con- sideration to involve. Just so here, as it seems to me, through the moral consciousness we come to the knowledg,e of God, arid so Religion in the order of our knowledge pre-supposes Morality as its ratio cognoseendi: but Morality remains ultimately unintelligible except through belief in God, and thus Morality, in the order of nature, pre-supposes the object of Religion as its ratio essendi. For, as a moralist so far removed in his views from dogmatic theism as our friend and Vice-President, Professor Alexander, has admirably said, "Mf orality is in itself and necessarily a kind of optimism" (Mforal Order and Progress, ii, 5, ? 37): and I fail to understand any justification of optimism of whatever kind, except in a belief which is already, to all intents and purposes, a kind of theism. 0n the other hand, Religion pre-supposes Morality in the sense that the evidence of the moral law requires no authentication by theological dogma, but that for us, at least at our present stnge of intellectual progress, the way to Religion must be through M forality: that the only fruitful thieology is that which makes its main appeal to the moral consciousness; counts it, with Plato (Rep. iii, 391), the worst of blasphemies to ascribe to God anythino but what the conscience can approve, makes it an axiom that though " clouds and darkness are round about him,," yet "rihiteousness anid judgment" (as we commonly understand those words) "*are the habitation of his seat" (Ps. xcvii, 2); holds that only to one for whom moral habit has issued in moral insight can tbe judg,ment of theological truth belong: as it is said in the Gospel, " If any one will do God's will, he shall know of the doctrine" (John, vii, 17). It is not the least of the many services rendered by Kant to the highest interests of humanity, that he so much insisted, and that at a time when such insistance was much needed, on the superiority ot the practical to the speculative reason in the sphere of theology. But this does not exhaust the whole problem which our question sets to us. Let us, still bearing in mind the already mentioned Aristotelian distinction between the two orders of knowledge, look for a moment at natural science. Here the facts of sense are 7povrpa jidEv: and from them we are led to scientific theory which explains these, and other facts as well, and so is vpc7epa 05o-fEi. Bat facts of sense would never have led to scientific theory but for thie presence from the firsr,</page><page sequence="8">MORALITY AND RELIGION. 5F 3 of a scientific impulse, a discontent with the Many, a craving after the One ill the Many. Yet this scientific impulse in its earliest manifestations assumes a form which appears, from the point of view of more highlv developed science, to be wbolly unscientific. MIytholo,ry, to parody the famous saying of Bacon about revenge, is a kind of wild science. Just so the facts of the moral conscious-ness, which lead to Religion as their explanation, are from the first associated with what is really a religious impulse, though early Religion, when judged by our moial standards, often seems immoral, and though ethical reformers have often found themselves thrown into a position antagonistic to the Religion aronod them. The moral consciousness is always the consciousness of an icleal other than our present state: for, even where there is complete self approval, there is a potential divergence implied in the actual coincidence of the ideal and the real. In its rudimentary form, however, the ideal may be very different from the ideal of a more advanced stage of moral culture. The sense of incompleteness and dependence, which is the germ of Religion, is scarcely disting,uisbable from the sense of the breach between real and ideal, which is the germ of Mlorality. And here, too, that which we set over against ourselves as the complement of our incompleteness, as the power which resists or constrains us, is not from the first the "holy God" of advanced Religion. The religious impnlse may lead to the worship of what is strangest, most inscrutable, most baffling, as wishing there, in that which is most alien from man, to find the likeness of man-for there is, I take it, persouification of sonme sort or kind in all worship. The supposed relig,ious suggestiveness of dreams is very easily understood, if we consider that here is found a specially close union of the likeness of man's common life with something most alien from it. For in dreamris we have scenes, actions, events, like those of man's life with his fellows, yet seemingly disconnected from the waking life, anLd to a great degree independent of its rules and customs. This observa- tion I make as it occurs to me, and for what it is worth. Thus early conceptions of Deity are probably conceptions of the powerful and the wonderful, rather than of the good. It is a a vain pedantry which attempts to rend away theology from its roots in that wonder, which is also, as Plato and Aristotle have told us, the starting point of all philosophy (Tl'heaet., 155 D., Metaplz. A., 982, b. 12). The Marcionites in the early Christian Church were guilty of this pedantry. They tried to believe in a good God, who should be otlher than, and opposed to, the Creator of the world. They ale not without imitators now, among those who, feel strongly the</page><page sequence="9">54 C. C. J. WEBB. pressure of " the riddle of the painful earth," and the truth of the poet's words: "Nature, red in tooth and claw, With ravine, shrieks against his creed." who believes in a Creator that is also a God of love. And these imitators are encouraged by thinkers such as Mr. Leslie Stephen, who bids them "choose between the Creator and the Judge " (Science of Ethics, p. 279). But Tertullian, in his treatise against the Mar- cionites, seems to me to have made it plain that our belief in God, though to us Morality may have become its principal evidence, rests ultimately on the evidence of power; that " God " means to the plain man primarily the power behind the world of his experience, though now also that this power is wielded according to moral Irles. The witness to God is twofold: " Totum hoc quod sumus et in quo samis," as Tertullian puts it (c. Marc., i, 10); "The starry heaven above me, and the moral law within me," as Kant has it (Kr. d. prakt. Vernunft, Theil. ii, Hart. v, 167). Natural science, philosophy, and morality start in one impulse of wonder, and one craving after unity. This impulse, and this craving, from the first, tend to be anthropomorphic; and this anthropo- morphism is the beginning of Religion. The different lines of rational effort have widely diverged; but Religion still maintains the hope of their ultimate reunion in a higher synthesis, in the beatific vision of the unity of Power, Wisdom, and Love, in the God whose image man has made in his own likeness, and yet not made wrongly, because he himself is made in the imge of God. III.-By A. F. SEiND. Before I discuss the arguments of Mr. Ryle and Mr. Webb let me, for clearness sake, distinguish between two senses in whicb we use the word presuppose. It may refer either to conceptions or to facts, and its meaning in both cases is different. If we argue that the conception of religion presupposes the conception of morality, we mean that the one is found, on analysis, to contain the other. If we argue, on the other hand, that morality as a fact presupposes the existence of religion, we mean that the fact of morality is dependent on the action of religion. Here, we may doubt whether the dis- junctive form of our question can be taken literally: for religion and morality interact, and each is what it is in part through the influence of the other. BDt we may mean something more when we say that morality</page><page sequence="10">MORALITY AND RELIGION. 55 presupposes religion, not merely that it is influenced by religion, for better or for worse, but that it presupposes the trath of religion. It is to this last enquiry that Mr. Webb has chiefly confined himself. I sympathise so much with his argament and conclasion that I find little to criticise iu it. If there is to be any proof of the Divine existence, not merely in the sense of an infinite intelligence, but of an infinite goodness, that proof, we shall most of us agree, must be based on the moral nature of man. But although the moral principal may justify our belief or faith in God, can there be evolved from it a strict proof of his existence? Morality, Mr. Webb argues, "remains ultimately unintelligible except through belief in God " (p. 2). In what sense is it unintelligible ? Is it that we cannot understand or interpret its existence except on the presup- position of this belief? That as materialism finds an impassable gulf between the whirl of atoms and the first dawn of conscious life, so an infinite intelligence without feeling or moral principle cannot account for the rise of these unique elements in man? There are those who will say, there are many things which we cannot, as yet, understand or interpret; if we, in ignorance of their origin, frame a hypothesis which seems to explain it, we must not mistake that hypothesis for scientific proof. Still have we not such a proof in Idealism ? Is it not the growing tendency of philosophy to adopt an idealistic theory of the world in opposition to the dualism of ordinary thought? In fact, if philosophy has proved anything it may be argued, it has surely proved that the universe has no reality except as related to mind or subject; and since that world is no illusion of ours, it must subsist in relation to a universal subject. Yet, assuming this, there is a great gap between this metaphysical conception and the God who satisfies the aspirations of the moral nature. It is the conception of what such a being ought to be, and the presence in the human soul of the instincts of trust and love, declaring what he must be, which remould this metaphysical conception into the God whom the heart worships. In this sense, morality pre-supposes religion, as claiming from the universe fulfilment of its aspirations. And morality justifies though it cannot prove this belief, because man is a practical as well as an intellectual being. As intellectual he strives to adjust his opinions to the evidences on which they are based: as practical he makes the best of a poor chance by throwing into the scale all the hope and confidence of which he is possessed. There are many things we must take iu a-n attitude of hope and trust, the character of those we love, the career wlhich we choose in youth, human life itself, above all God. Our reasoned opinions undergo a transformation when taken as principles on which we act:</page><page sequence="11">5 O A. F. SHAND. for we cannot act with vigour and constancy without courage, hope, and confidence; and these emotions import into our opinions a greater certainty than can be theoretically justified. Hence religions bias, and political party spirit. Do you suppose that any politician in the strife of party faction could maintain that scientific attitude to his opinions whicb he may have adopted in their formation. He inevitably comes to regard them with greater confidence, and opposite opinions with greater distrust. He loves the one and hates the other. And though these emotions often hurry him into excesses, yet withont them he would not find the energy and courage to act in the teeth of opposition. He would become an " armn-chair politician," or " doctrinaire," ready to discuss but not to act, free from the influences which disturb a chastened scientific judgment, but free also from the generous enthusiasm, the hatred of wrong, which makes the great political reformer. Thus while it is our intellectual ideal to hold opinions with a belief in proportion to their evidences, practical considerations oblire us to hold them with a degree in excess of that. And between these moods we alternate, or incline to the one or the other, according to our character and circumstances. Through a confusion between this scientific attitude of enquiry and the practical attitude in which the motive power to realise ideas is of supreme importance, many think a belief vvhich is not propor- tionate to its evidences is morally wrong (Clifford's Essays, Vol. 11, p. 176). Bat this confusion turns most disastrously against the scien- tific life itself, because, like all great things, that life is based on trust-the trust that knowledge must benefit the race, and can never destroy what is supremely precious to it. Morality then justifies trust or faith, because oar whole practical life depends on it; and it justifies our trust in God because that is the logical presupposition of all trust whatever. As Mr. Webb truly remarks, there is no other " justification of optimism " than this. But there is another sense in which we may interpret the state- ment that morality is unintelligible apart from belief in God. It may mean that morality, apart from this belief, contains an insoluble contradiction. The attempt to prove this lies in an application of the Hegelian doctrine of the negative or false infinite to the facts of the moral life. Our moral life has an infinite ideal; but, it is argued, if that ideal be not eternally realised in God, it becomes self-contra- dictory. Man hopes to transcend the finite. Step by step he climbs toward perfection. But as he breaks through his old limits, be finds himself confined in new ones. His goal is as far off as ever. By no progress, however indefinitely prolonged, will he reach it. Because he has taken the false infinite of quantity, which contra-</page><page sequence="12">MORALITY AND RELIGION. 57 dicts itself, inasmuch as what is real in it is always finite (Intro- duction to thLe Philosophy of Religion, Dr. Caird, pp. 295-6). But God is the true infinite eternally realised. In him the contradiction between the real and ideal is at rest; and man, in losing his particular being in this universal life, escapes too from contradiction, and consummates his ideal. We have only to assume the truth of this conception to see that it refutes itselr. What if in God the contradiction between the real and ideal vanishes, in man, as long- as he be man, it remains. He cannot rest in contemplation of the Divine perfection: he cannot regard that as the fulfilment of his idesd. Such quietism would be the destruction, not the realisation, of morality. But if his ideal of indefinite progress miust remain, the assuimption of God's existence has not solved the contradiction of his moral life. The proof of this assumption fails, like so many other attempts to demonstrate the necessity of God. The false or negative infinite, as it is called, c lings to man, because he is a finite spirit and not the infinite spirit. He lives in time, not in eternitv. And as he creeps from point to point, he strives ever for progress; for that is the only ideal possible to him. But morality is held to presuppose the truth of religion on other grounds than this. There are some who think that moral laws have no binding power apar-t from the will of a Sipreme being. This conception has been so often refuted that I need say little about it. There is an obvious fallacy in its reasonings. We only ought to obey the Divine will so far as we conceive it to be a moral will, and not because it is almibhty. Morality is based on no external sanction, its only and sufficient sanction is within itself. I now pass to the question which Mr. Ryle has considered, whether religion presupposes morality. We may admit that it is true generally of all the higher religio-ns, and all that we should, properly speaking,, call religion. But I think it would be difficult for Mr. Ryle and Mr. Webb to prove that, using religion in the widest historical sense of that term, that there is always a moral elemnent implied in its conception. From the premise of Mfr. Webb tbiat " Religion is f undamentally anthlropomorphic, riaking God in the likeness of man" (p. 1), the conclIsion " therefore moral " does not follow. The con- ception of a devil is also anthropomorphic; but we scarcely concei-ve him as moral. Man is jealous of the prerogatives of his moral nature. He is more ready to think evil than good of strangers:. and when he recognises that he is surrounded by strange and mysterious powers, the terror which his situation evokes makes him the more ready to conceive them as selfish and cruel. If he obey a cruel chief may he not also, through the same impulse of fear, worship a cruel God ?</page><page sequence="13">58 A. F. SHAND. He has learnt that bad men may be propitiated by service, flattery, sacrifices; and it is the combination of all these he offers to his God. By these means he hopes to escape his vengeance, and even to gain some protection to himself. If this expectation be not disappointed- if the forces of nature which he ascribes to the action of his God are on the whole favourable to him-he may come to trust and love this Being, and in consequence to transfer to him moral qaalities. But how often must the action of such being-s have perplexed him, by their caprice, their readiness to alternate good and evil treatment without reason, as the powers of nature would perp]ex us in their moral aspect, did we still personify them! And as the roots of religion seem independent of morality, so the highest religions may relapse to the same level of fear and selfish- ness. The biographer of a great Statesman tells us that his religion was the caution of a wise general who is careful not to leave his rear exposed. And in " Holy Willie's Prayer," by Burns, we have an incomparable satire upon a genaine phase of Calvinism- "0 thou, wha in the heavens dost dwell, Wha, as it pleases best thysel', Sends ane to heaven, and ten to hell, A' for thy glory, And no for ony guid or ill They've done afore thee!" I do not think we can call any religion moral in which the being worshipped is regarded as a selfish irresponsible tyrant. Nor can man be said to be moral until he comes, from whatever motives, to include the good of others, his family at least, in his own good. Not until his gods require good conduct, such as he conceives it, toward his fellow men, in addition to services appropriated to themselves, can they be entitled moral. I conceive then that Religion and Morality sprang from indepen- dent roots; the one from awe and terror of the mysterious powers which surround us, the other from a common interest in our fellow men. Bat though they sprang separately, they tended to grow together. There seems to be a close psychological connection between the conception of a being that arouses awe and wonder, and the attribution of goodness to him. It is hard for anyone who is sensitive to the beauty and mystery of the great forces of nature not to feel that the infinite power that co-ordinates them is as immeasur- ably above man in knowledge and goodness, as in all otber respects. A natural chain of associatiou leads from the attribution of one kind of greatness to the attribution of others.

Tennyson expresses this in the words " Doubt no longer that the highest is the wisest and the best." Still it seems probable that this passage from the conception of power to that of goodness was not reached, until the terror of a mysterious agency was supplemented by gratitude or admiration. But when this passage is reached religion is combined with morality. The religion of fear grows into the religion of reverence and love. Each as it exists and develops is influenced by the action of the other. Each presupposes the other. But, as man still conceives God as requiring sometbing on his own acconnt, for his personal glory or advantage, as he has transferred to him human egoism and vanity, as well as justice and love, so this element of selfishness in religion tends again to separate it from morality as it tends to alienate man from his conscience. To a later age the beliefs and practices which God is held to require on his own account mav be regarded as immoral. Morality has advaanced; Religion has remained stationary. The best and most courageous men are found outside its ranks. Judged by the higher moral conceptions which society has reached, religion no longer presupposes morality, but immorality. Bat, by this alienation, both are losers. Religion sinks to a superstition whose function it is to preserve effete moral conceptions and to soothe the terrors of men in respect of this world or another; and morality, deprived of its faith, its stimulus, its consolation, tends to grow weary and pessimistic.</page></plain_text>
