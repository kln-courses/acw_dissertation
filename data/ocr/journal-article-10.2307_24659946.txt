ISBN 3-11-012405-X. The contents of this book are virtually identical with those of the author's Ph. D. dissertation accepted in 1989 by the Department of Studies in Religion of the University of Queensland (Australia). Its author provides the results of investigations into the origins and development of the Antichrist myth in early Christianity. He labels his study as an attempt to a synthesis which builds on the work of numerous other scholars, but also as a presentation of detailed proposals on specific mat ters of interpretation and a critique of the majority views on the origins and development of the Antichrist myth (p. xv). After an "Abstract and Acknowledgements", a "List of Tables" and "Abbreviations", the introductory chapter (The Question of the Antichrist Myth) deals mainly with an overview of the research into the subject during the last hundred years or so and the outlines of the present study (pp. 1-26). J. faithfully records the contributions offered by H. Journal for the Study of Judaism, XXIV, 2, © E. J. Brill, Leiden</page><page sequence="2">306 REVIEW OF books Gunkel, W. Bousset, M. Friedländer, R.H. Charles, W.A. Meeks, J. Ernst, A. Yarbo Collins, K. Grayston and W.C. Weinrich with special emphasis on Bousset's and Charles' works [Surprisingly, the work of Rigaux, L'antechrist, 1932, is not dealt with, although it is men tioned in note 1 of the introductory chapter]. Although the broad lines of Bousset's hypothesis as modified by Charles have been accepted by many scholars, J. concludes that Bousset's work shows a number of serious weaknesses. Bousset believed that the Antichrist tradition was an anthropomorphic transformation of the Dragon myth, the Jewish form of which focused on an evil figure known as Beliar. He posited an essentially a-political Beliar Apocalypse which the author of Revelation drew into service as an anti-Roman polemic by combining it with an early form of the Nero myth. He relied on late sources, extrapolating from them a hypothetical "Antichrist myth" which he by stressing oral tradition dated back into the 2nd cent. BC, and he used the term "Antichrist" indiscriminately of any and all figures opposed to God or God's people. In contradistinction to Bousset, J. wants to provide adequate explana tions of the earlier texts without recourse to the hypothesis of an esoteric oral tradition about an Antichrist figure. In his opinion, the Antichrist myth developed as a result of the convergence of older traditions under the influence of specific historical and sociological circumstances within the early Christian church. This thesis is developed in the three major sections of the author's book. The first part (The Antichrist Myth in the Third Century, pp. 27-116) deals with an examination of the earliest Christian literature that une quivocably describes the Antichrist: the literature from Irenaeus onwards till about 300 CE. The most significant witnesses to the Antichrist myth, which was already known to Celsus, are Irenaeus, Hippolytus and Origen. Important in this connection is also the Apocalypse of Elijah. J. points out that Old Testament passages (in particular from Isaiah and Daniel) as used in 2 Thessalonians and Revelation exercised an important influence upon the form of the myth at this time. The persecution of the church by the Roman authorities appears to have exerted little direct influence on its shaping. More important influences were caused by the crises which the church faced over the rise of false teachers and questions concerning the lapsed. Rome is never identified with the Antichrist or his kingdom. The Nero redivivus myth is not widely attested in the Antichrist literature. The Antichrist was understood as a satanic counterpart of Christ, as a false messiah, a son of the devil and an agent of judgement, who is supported by Satan, although his relationship with the latter is not defined in any satisfactory way. As a "deceiver" the Antichrist will imitate Christ as completely as possible. The signs of the Antichrist's advent are seen in the activity of false teachers and by divisions within the</page><page sequence="3">REVIEW OF BOOKS 307 church. Other portents include the partitioning of the Roman empire, the revival of a united form of the empire under its new, evil ruler and the latter's favourable treatment of the Jews. At his first appearance, the Antichrist will portray himself as a pious, sober and just saviour of the world, especially as the restorer of the national and religious life of the Jews. But soon he will reveal his real character as an aggressive, cruel and despotic tyrant. He will claim divine honours for himself. He will seat himself in the temple (cf. 2 Thess. 2:4). His horrible reign preceding the parousia of Christ, will last 42 months, in which a pair of eschatological prophets will condemn him, only to suffer martyrdom. The second part ofj.'s study deals with the "Antecedent Traditions to the Antichrist Myth" (pp. 117-192). This division examines Jewish literature prior to the Common Era for ideas which may have contributed to the Antichrist myth. J. challenges the common scholarly assertion that the Antichrist myth was a pre-Christian Jewish tradition (cf. Bousset), but he admits that the later Antichrist descriptions were not produced de novo, but were a creative blending of much older traditions of quite diverse origins. He bases his thesis on a treatment of the descriptions of demonic powers in a) non-Qumranic Jewish writings (1 Enoch, Jubilees, Martls, SibOr I-II, VitaeProph) and b) the Qumran texts, and a consideration of the impact which Antiochus IV had on Jewish apocalyptic thought. He stresses that Mastema/Satan/Belial, the leader of the evil angels, in the non-Qumranic and in the Qumranic writings cannot be looked upon as an Antichrist figure. Though Belial became the key symbol for evil in any form, there is no evidence that there existed a Belial myth as suggested by Bousset and Charles which could be considered as a pre-Christian Jewish Antichrist myth. Though there are connections between the descriptions of Antiochus IV in Daniel and the later texts which describe the Antichrist figure (they indeed drew heavily upon the canonical book), the Antichrist myth is essentially a Christian myth: Antiochus is not a messianic pretender nor an opponent of any messianic figure. J. adds a chapter on motifs found in pre-Christian Jewish literature which provide parallels to one or more aspects of the later Antichrist myth (false teachers and heretics; lawlessness and the climax of evil; the deceit motif; the end tyrant figure; the Jewish people; persecution of the elect; divine sovereignty; destruction of the hostile powers; ambivalence towards the Roman empire). Especially this chapter shows a number of flaws testify ing to methodical carelessness and an unawareness of what is going on in Qumran studies. The author juxtaposes his quoted Qumran texts (which contain an irritating large number of mistakes), uncritically reproduced from Lohse's edition, to Vermes's translation in The Dead Sea Scrolls in English (19873). This procedure of course brings about a good number of discrepancies between text and translation, in particular in the case of</page><page sequence="4">308 REVIEW OF BOOKS restored lacunae. The author identifies (without further comment) the Wicked priest with the Liar (p. 170), does not consider that "deceit" in the Qumran scrolls has to do with "false" halakha, and calls 1QH VI, 29-35 an Aramaic text (p. 178). Furthermore, his treatment of 4ζ) Test is rather superficial. His conclusion that "there does not seem to be anything in this passage [4Q_ Test 21-30] suggesting an eschatological Endtyrant figure" surprises in view of the eschatological figures men tioned in the preceding lines. The third and final part (The Emerging Antichrist Myth, pp. 193-355) examines Jewish and Christian literature in the period ca 40-180 CE. In a first chapter J. treats at length endtyrant traditions prior to 70 CE found in the eschatological discourse tradition in the Synoptic gospels, in Paul's teaching on the advent of the man of lawlessness in 2 Thessalonians, and in the depiction of the beast from the sea in Revelation. J. concludes that the figure of an endtyrant emerges with increasing clarity, largely under the pressure of the historical crises ca 40 and 66-73 CE., a process which culminated in the development of an Antichrist figure in early Christian thought. In a following chapter J. deals with endtyrant traditions after 70 CE as found in the Sibylline Oracles, the Epistle of Barnabas, 4 Ezra, the Apocalypse of Abraham, 2 Baruch, the Odes of Solomon, 3 Baruch and the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs. He does not find in them an Antichrist figure but rather evidence that the Belial figure continued to serve as a major symbol of evil for Jewish and Christian writers, in some cases being combined with the emerging Nero legend as a composite Nero-Belial figure. This was in his opinion not an intermediate stage in the development of the Antichrist figure, but rather a parallel and alter native development. Finally, he considers the texts in which the earliest definitive evidence for the Antichrist myth seems to be found: Didache, Testament of Hezekiah, the Johannine epistles, the Apocalypse of Peter, Polycarp's epistle to the Philippians and the Dialogue of Justin Martyr. In his Conclusion (pp. 357-366) J. summarizes the results of his study under three headings: Points of general agreement, matters still subject to debate, and the synthesis proposed in this study. Concerning the points of general agreement it cannot be doubted that there existed an well estab lished Antichrist myth within early Christian eschatology by the begin ning of the third century CE. The myth, at least in its formative stage, reveals several major strands, one connected with the ancient combat myth, one connected with the idea of the false prophet, and one connected with the idea of an endtyrant. The extent to which one or other of these strands within the developing Antichrist tradition was emphasized largely depended on the immediate situation of the writer. Historical events (e.g. the crisis under Antiochus IV, Caligula's attempt to install an image of him in the temple, the death of Nero, the fall of Jerusalem and its temple)</page><page sequence="5">REVIEW OF BOOKS 309 had a profound influence on the development of the Antichrist myth. It is possible that the transition from general Jewish endtyrant tradition to a specifically Christian myth of an anti-Christ figure took place in the con text of the first Jewish revolt against the Romans.—Matters still subject to debate concern largely methodological issues. E.g., while Beliar in THez seems to have been an Antichrist figure, that cannot in J.'s opinion be extrapolated to all instances of the name.—As to the synthesis proposed in this study, J. stresses that, although the Antichrist myth drew on older traditions, especially those of the false prophet and the endtyrant, it was a christocentric adaptation and blending of Jewish religious traditions. In their new Christian context, these traditions underwent decisive developments (which did not stop at the end of the third century!) and became traditions about a pretender to the position attributed to Jesus in Christian thought. All in all, this is a most welcome study which brings up to date the infor mation we presently have about the origins and development of the Antichrist myth. The author's criticism of Bousset's ideas may be right as such, but the present reviewer cannot help to ask himself whether there did not exist already in Jewish apocalyptic circles of the last centuries BC the idea of an anti-Messiah as a result of the Wirkungsgeschichte of texts like Zech 11:15-17 and perhaps Dan 7, cf. also 4QTestimonia. J. himself assu mes a "general Jewish endtyrant tradition". Within the framework of messianic expectations this endtyrant could readily become an anti Messiah. This supposition would explain the rather quick emergence of the Antichrist myth in early Christian eschatology. That the myth is merely a Christian fabric based on the blending of Jewish religious tradi tions, as suggested by J., can be doubted. The ideas of Bousset and Charles could therefore, notwithstanding their deficiencies, contain a bit more truth than J. is ready to admit. A.S. VAN DER WOUDE</page></plain_text>
