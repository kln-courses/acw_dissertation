They show that, although Sotheby's has been selling manuscripts almost from its inception, there is no shortage of fine items to be purchased or real discoveries to be made. The number of private collectors has noticeably increased in response. The expansion of the market can be most readily illustrated by the annual figures over the last few years: in 1975 the turnover of the Department was about ?289,000; last year-by far the most successful season to date-the figure was about ?1,600,000, not including sales of musical manuscripts. These figures represent expansion both in the numbers and size of sales and also in real financial terms, with the consequence that more and more owners of manuscripts are recognising the existence of a market in which good prices will be realised for assets that often went unappreciated or under- valued. It is no boast to state that record prices are achieved with great regularity. Sales are made up from many sources: correspondences, archives, albums, collections and single items, and include literary manuscripts, historical documents, letters and papers from virtually all countries, Continental and Russian literary and historical manuscripts, naval and military papers, especially log-books and diaries, manuscript maps and plans, cookery and account books, heraldic collections, letters and papers of writers, musicians, composers, poets, monarchs, historical figures, explorers, inventors, scientists, doctors and nurses (one archive of letters by Florence Nightingale fetched ?7,500), philosophers, political theorists, travellers, sportmen and celebrated lovers. Last season was dominated by three sales: that of the Lyttelton Papers on 12th December 1978, sold on behalf of the Viscount Cobham; the sale on 13th and 14th March 1979 which included the Mercator Atlas that sold for ?340,000, a price that broke the previous record for any atlas by ?300,000, and also included the papers of the African explorer James Grant, at ?110,000 in sixty-seven lots, the papers of General Sir Eyre Coote at ?30,000 and those of G. F. Watts, Sir Harry Luke and Enid Bagnold, author of National Velvet; and the sale on 23rd and 24th July with the diary of Vaslav Nijinsky at ?45,000, the papers of John Galsworthy at ?48,000, a volume of the diary of Francis Kilvert at ?10,000 and the first part of the library of Lady Gregory consisting chiefly of poetical and prose manuscripts, letters and books of W. B. Yeats. A feature of recent sales has been substantial archives of the papers of individuals, usually sold as single lots, including those (other than the ones already mentioned) of the fourth Earl of Carnarvon (?30,000); of the Portuguese ambassador to England from 1657 to 1665 (?33,000), of William Beckford (?120,000), sold by order of His Grace the Duke of Hamilton), of Augustus John (?52,000), the philosopher G. E. Moore (?48,000), and substantial groups of papers by William Cowper and Rupert Brooke. ...... ... ..... ........... ;..... .... ..... ... . . . . ..:] :f ::[ : :::;?

No other auction house holds sales of a size comparable to these, consisting entirely* of Continental and Russian manuscripts. Highlights of recent sales are letters by Trotsky and Tolstoy, the herbarium of J-J Rousseau (?7,500), a magnificent letter by Lucretia Borgia (?8,500) a series of 233 letters by Napoleon to his stepson, the last page of a letter about sunspots by Galileo (?17,500) and part of the manuscript of Proust's "A la Recherche du Temps Perdu". These sales will in future contain musical manuscripts and letters. The Department also issues two catalogues a year, each containing up to 600 lots, realising from about ?10 to ?1,000, among them being standard documents signed by monarchs, examples of the handwriting of the famous and such pieces as photographs signed by the Beatles, Christmas cards signed by T. S. Eliot, a serviette signed by Elvis Presley, letters by Crippen, literary portraits, items of interest to postal historians, samples of writing paper, old cheques and the like. In the sale held on 18-20 June, last year it was possible to purchase letters in the handwriting of Charles Dickens for prices ranging from ?50 to ?120, although a fine letter by him can make well over ?1,000. In. the same sale letters by the following authors were purchased for fairly modest sums: Robert Browning (?90-?120), Winston Churchill (?55-?300), Conrad (?60-?120), Disraeli (?50-?90, although it may be noted that up to ?2,400 has been obtained for a single letter by him), Robert Graves (?15- ?55) , Thomas Hardy (?50-?140), Kipling (?45-?75), G. B. Shaw (?38-?180) and W. B. Yeats (?70-?150). A sale of this nature will be the first in the New Year. It will be followed by a sale of Continental and Musical Manuscripts in April, which will contain a sensational letter by Simon Bolivar. In May we shall be selling the celebrated collection of the late R. E. D. Rawlins, author of the Guinness Book of World Autographs. Mr Rawlins began collecting in 1932 when he asked the ninth Duke of Devonshire for his autograph-the Duke wrote "You are a nuisance" and had to be further persuaded before he put his signature to his testy sentiment. Mr Rawlins went on to build a collection of nearly 20,000 items, which is without doubt the largest of its kind assembled in recent years. // 9 /7,- 1iK? e dr The marriage certificate of Charles II and Catherine of Braganza, from the papers of the Portuguese Ambassador to England.

Inspection and Valuation The provision of valuations is an essential part of our service. We prepare written valuations for Insurance and Capital Transfer Tax purposes and have a Valuations Department whose staff are specialists in all valuation problems. The fee for written Probate and Insurance valuations is 11/2% up to ?10,000, 1% from ?10,000 to ?100,000, 1/2% thereafter. Valuations for other purposes are undertaken in accordance with fees previously negotiated with clients. We will refund part of the fee if any of the property valued comes in for sale within three months. As selling is our principle business we are happy to provide saleroom estimates free of charge. If you would like anything valued in this way, you should bring it to Sotheby's between 9.30 am and 4.30 pm on any weekday or send us a clear black and white photograph, with dimensions and brief details. If neither course is feasible and if you have property which you are seriously considering selling, we can visit your home. For an oral opinion of sales values we charge out of pocket expenses and in some circumstances a fee, but if within three months of a visit we receive property for sale which realises over ?1,000 the fee will be refunded. Taxation Advisory Service Sotheby's is able to provide specialist advice to clients and their professional advisers on taxation matters, particularly in connection with the disposal or acquisition of works of art but also, more generally, on the wider aspects of taxation, especially Capital Gains Tax and Capital Transfer Tax. Terms of Sale by Auction Except at auction sales of Wine, Coins and Medals our commission payable by the vendor is 10% on all lots sold, plus V.A.T. (currently 15%).

For Wine, Coins and Medals the commission payable by the vendor is 15% plus V.A.T. (with, in the case of Coins and Medals, a minimum charge of ?7.50 per lot).

He soon received commissions for paintings including one from Queen Victoria. In the summer of 1873 he held an exhibition of paintings and photographs at the Langham Hotel in London. The Times on 1st August reported that 'with the temperature in the 80's, it is delightful without goingfurther than the Langham Hotel, to revel in the cooling presence of icebergs half a mile long and glaciers that fill three miles and a half of fjord... 'The Wreck of an Emigrant Ship on the Coast of New England', in which the painting of the ship is particularly powerful, ... the great distmasted ship from which the shoreboats are taking off the huddled passengers is treated with a sailor's knowledge as well as a painter's feeling'. Bradford seems to have sold the painting in the first months of 1874 when he resigned and dated it. He left England in the middle of that year and returned to America. ix</page><page sequence="12">Sotheby'S LONDON Wednesday 6th February, 1980, at 11 am George W.

The necklace, in the form of a crescent-shaped pectoral, is wrought in pure gold and weighs 88.80 gr. The pectoral consists of a frame of heavy twisted wire, divided by columns and tree-trunks into five fairly sym- metrical sections in which are arranged six anthropomorphic figures (four satyrs and two priests) and three animals (a goat or antelope, a griffin and a winged lion); branches, vines and leaves are freely in- terwoven among the columns and wind about the figures. The tapered ends of the frame are bound by ferrules decorated with granulated and filigree geometrical forms; triple loop-in-loop chains link this lower set of terrules to another identical set, designed as the collars of the lion- headed finials which bear the hook-and- eye clasp. Dimensions: outer diameter: 150 mm. inner diameter: 118 mm. width of pectoral at tapered ends: 16 mm. width of pectoral at cen- tre: 32 mm. length of chains: 75 mm. (left) and 77 mm. (right). length of ferrules: 13 mm. The metal is yellow with reddish over- tones. The main figures are stamped in sheet gold. The various sections of the necklace are soldered by the process common to all gold-crafting of the classical age, of which the secret was lost for centuries. (Only since 1933, when Littledale patented the colloidal hard-soldering technique, which seems to be the same as that used in antiquity, has this mystery apparently been solved.)' Since the circumstances of the discovery of the necklace are unknown to us, as is the geographical area of prove- nience, we will attempt to place it through an analysis of the stylistic elements and of the probable cultural background of the unknown goldsmith. To begin, let us interpret the scene represented on the pectoral. The climb- ing vine, bedecked with leaves and ber- ries, which branches out from the base of the centre column, represents the "tree of life." Two lateral columns seem to delimit a sacred area toward which two satyrs approach bearing a sacrificial animal hung by its hoofs from the long pole across their shoulders. Two priests follow these satyrs toward the ritual area, and are in turn followed by another pair of satyrs; a winged lion and a griffin wind up the double proces- sion. The scene is clearly a celebration of the Dionysian mystery, whose ritual spread among all the Mediterranean peoples in the 6th century B.C. The Dionysian theme appears very frequently in Greek and Etruscan art, and later in that of the Romans, and is one of the principle scenes treated by vase-painters. But if the subject matter of our necklace belongs particularly to the Mediterranean area, the stylistic elements and the shape itself of the pectoral are unparalleled in the jewellery of the classical period, with the exception of the loop-in-loop chains and the lion-headed finials which, in both concept and form, are common to all of the Greek schools including those of the colonies, both western and eastern. In its "lunula" shape and in its open- work detail, the structure of our necklaces can be compared only to two extraordinary gold necklaces discovered in the 4th century Scythian tombs in southern Russia: one found at Tolstaya Mogila on the lower reaches of the Dniepr River, the other at Great Bliznitsa on the Taman peninsula just east of the Crimea, now respectively in the State Historical Museum of Kiev and in the Hermitage Museum in Leningrad.2 Both are the work of Greek craftsmen for Scyths. It is therefore probable that our necklace originated in the area once dominated by the Scyths, and reflects their contact with Greek civilisation. The Scyths, a nomadic people of horse- raisers and warriors who inhabited the vast forest and steppe regions between the Dniester River and Lake Aral, developed an original artistic style based on the ex- treme stylization of animal subjects (known today as "steppe art"). In the 8th century B.C., some Scyths settled in the lower basin of the Dniepr, in the Crimea and in the Kuban are north of the Caucasus (more or less the modern- day Ukraine), and formed a sort of tribal confederation. In the following century, several Greek colonies were founded on the northern edges of the Black Sea, of X Ate, oe Wq, 0 tie AIr xxxviii</page><page sequence="41">W4 'AV Y 7TWA? vj Gold and enamel necklace from Great Bliznitsa (Taman peninsula, U.S.S.R.).

By the 6th century, com- mercial relations between Scyths and Greeks were intense: the Greeks furnished locally-manufactured goods to the Scyths in return for grain. While for commercial purposes the Greeks utilized themes and forms from the Scythian tradition to decorate their wares, they in turn transmitted to the tribesmen themes and stylizations proper to their own Mediterranean culture. The objects found in the 4th century tombs of Scythian nobles - that is, when the Scythian kingdom founded at the end of the 5th century was at its height --prove that many metal-craftsmen in the Greek colonies worked in a culturally hybrid style not to be found elsewhere. Except for the Tolstaya Mogila and the Great Bliznitsa necklaces, we have found no other examples in classical jewellery of the same type of twisted-wire crescent- shaped frame, and it is significant that the "lunula" is a characteristic Crimean form, though it is usually found as a smooth, flat metal sheet. The crescent of the Great Bliznitsa necklace is completely filled with the animal figures which are the characteristic theme of Greco-Scythian art in this period (oxen, horses, dogs chasing hares). Although the middle tier of the Tolstaya Mogila necklace is a sheet of gold embossed with spiral motifs, the same animal theme dominates here as well, even if at the centre of the tranquil pastoral scene in the upper tier two men appear, intent perhaps on flaying a hide. While in its shape and in certain details of construction (lion-headed finials, chains linking sets of ferrules) our necklace resembles the known Russian exemplars, it differs markedly from the latter in that the human figure dominates the composition, illustrating a ritual associated in art with the Mediterranean area. The realism and dynamic tension in the figures and in the composition are altogether different, however, from the geometrical harmony and the idealiza- tion of the human figure found in the works of art produced in the various Mediterranean centres of classical culture. The fine modelling and anatomical detail of the sacrificial animal calls to mind, among other examples, the dying horse on the Hermitage's gold comb from Solokha just north of the Crimea, pro- duced by Greek craftsmen for Scyths. The marked physical effort of the two satyrs who are placing the offering at the foot of the "tree of life" has been rendered realistically, down to the detail of the pole bending under the animal's weight. The forceful forward motion of the two priests toward the centre of the composi- tion is barely attenuated by their long robes; the swift, agile running step of the satyrs who follow is strongly accentuated by the great (spread of their legs and the off-centre position of heads and trunks. This naturalistic treatment of even the slightest details of the figures, accen- tuated by their dynamic tension, is characteristic of the toreutic production of the Black Sea Greek colonies for the Scythian market during the 4th century. Other particularly striking examples are the two Scythian archers on a gold plaque from Kul Oba (Crimea); the horse-tamers on the famous silver-gilt amphora from Chertomlyk; and (though already more Hellenistic in style) the gold scabbards portraying a battle between Greeks and barbarians of which both the Metropolitan Museum of New York and the Hermitage have examples. 5 The stylization of the griffin and the winged lion recalls the traditional treat- ment of these monsters by the Scyths, as can be seen by comparing the numerous gold plaques and the decoration of metal vessels in the Hermitage collection.6 The Greeks inherited the figures of the griffin and other winged creatures, which originated in Mesopotamia in the 4th millenium, from earlier civilizations of Western Asia; the Scyths had assimiilated them independently of their contact with the Greek world, for the tribes of south Russia and the Black Sea area had adopted various cults derived from the ancient religions of Asia Minor and cen- tral Asia. The symbolism of the "tree of life" was also well-known in western Asia, and its use by the Scyths from earliest times can be observed, for example, in two gold- plated scabbards in the Hermitage, 8 and on the gold pectoral from the 7th or 6th century tomb of a Scythian prince found at Ziwiye (Iran). 9 The latter, rimmed by a pinecone motif, is divided horizontally in two tiers, on which two processions of composite creatures converge toward a stylized "tree of life" at the centre, flank- ed by two pairs of goats and bulls. The Ziwiye composition is clearly analogous to that of our necklace. All these factors concur in leading us to believe that our necklace originated somewhere along the northern coast of the Black Sea or in its immediate hinterland. That the Dionysian theme was an unusual choice for the Greek goldsmiths of Olbia and Pantikapaion in their work for Scythian customers seems a further proof of the reciprocal cultural borrowing between Scyths and Greeks in the 4th century.

Yet their oil paintings have received little attention and no publication has been devoted to them. In this beautifully produced book which has taken over 20 years to complete, Maurice Shellim has catalogued and arranged chronologically all of the 151 known oil paintings - 119 by Thomas and 32 by William and includes reproductions of them all, many in full colour. It is the first book to give a broad view of the artists' oil paintings of India made between 1787 and 1836. These fine oil paintings played a great part in stimulating the fashionable taste for the romantic and picturesque. Through Thomas and William the British gained their first accurate knowledge of Indian architecture and the country's exotic scenery - vast rivers, great waterfalls, mountains and mysterious caves. 'India and the Daniells' will be treasured by collectors, galleries and museums as a unique source of reference and a joy to the reader.
