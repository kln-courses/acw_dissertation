This seventeenth-century account of events that occurred nearly two centuries earlier, however, should not necessarily be taken at face value. It reflects, among other things, Sho Shin's successful creation of the "tradition" of royal authority deriving from teda (tM&amp; or H), the sun-as-deity. In this ideological creation, official priestesses played a major role in court politics through their positions at the nexus of divine and secular power. During the seventeenth century, the Ryukyuan court began to rely on Chinese-derived models of kingship, which relegated female officials to increasingly marginal roles. Neverthe- less, priestesses continued to occupy official positions within Ryu- kyu's government until the kingdom's end in 1879. Historians and other scholars during this century have often tried to explain the precise nature of the relationship between the Ryu- kyuan king and the high priestess (kikoe-ogimi MrWkA), or, more generally, between male government officials and their female coun- terparts. In this essay, I examine both changes and continuities in the religious, ideological, and ceremonial basis of royal authority in Ryukyu. Always an eclectic mix of foreign and domestic elements, the ideological basis of the Ryukyuan monarchy changed as kings and their allies sought to re-define and clarify the royal institution in response to challenges posed by internal and external forces. With respect to official priestesses, for example, early in the sixteenth cen- tury they functioned as empowering agents, whose power was on a par with that of the king and his male officials. By the eighteenth cen- tury, however, the priestesses had become technical specialists, clearly subordinate to the king and his male officials. Before proceeding with the analysis, I should briefly discuss the geopolitical status of Ryukyu. Sho Hashi A E unified the island of Okinawa under his rule in the early fifteenth century. Prior to that time, political power in Okinawa and the other Ryukyu islands was in the hands of local warlords known as aji or anji W .' Throughout the fifteenth century, a succession of Okinawan kings gradually con- 3 According to official histories compiled in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Okinawa had been a united country since around 1187, but had been divided into principali- ties during the reign of the morally dissolute King Tamagusuku ]Lg; (r. 1314-1337). In these narratives, therefore, Sho Hashi re-united Okinawa under one king. Modern historians of Ryukyu, however, commonly regard unification under Sho Hashi as the first such event.</page><page sequence="3">ROYAL AUTHORITY IN RYUKYU 91 quered the other Ryukyu islands, forging a kingdom that extended from the Amami-Oshima islands in the north through the Miyako island group to the southwest of Okinawa. These kings also strength- ened their power vis-'a-vis the aji, creating a centralized bureaucra- cy in the process. The late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries was a time of material abundance for Ryukyu, whose court, offi- cials, and leading merchants prospered as middlemen in an exten- sive trade network that stretched from India to Korea. China and Japan were particularly important for the small island kingdom, which regularly sent diplomatic envoys to both places, as well as to other countries. The logic of modern nationalism has asserted that if today's Ryukyuans are Japanese, they must always have been so. Some modern Japanese historians have combined this axiom with the widely held notion of Japan as a "single ethnic group and homogeneous culture" (tan 'itsu minzoku, tan 'itsu bunka - IL) to claim that the ancient Ryukyu kingdom was part of Japan. Nakamatsu Yahiide, for example, has argued that the early in- habitants of Ryukyu were culturally related to the Japanese of the mainland. From this premise, he postulates an awareness of politi- cal subordination to Japan's court and bakufu on the part of early Okinawans.4 Although Ryukyu's status vis-'a-visJapan is debatable from 1609 to 1879, the kingdom prior to that time was an indepen- dent country by any definition. In 1609, the domain of Satsuma invaded Ryukyu with the ap- proval of the Tokugawa bakufu. Owing in large part to the rise of the Qing dynasty and the opportunities and dangers it presented to the various political entities of Japan, Ryukyu retained a substan- tial measure of autonomy from the mid-seventeenth century until the 1870s. Satsuma and the bakufu exerted political hegemony over the kingdom indirectly, working through Ryukyu's royal govern- ment. Ryukyu maintained formal relations with China from the fourteenth century onward, and Japanese domination had the effect of increasing the degree of Chinese cultural influence on Ryukyu. 4 Takara Kurayoshi summarizes the main arguments of those claiming pre-1609 Ryukyu as part of Japan and provides specific examples, including extensive reference to the argu- ments of Nakamatsu. He rightly criticizes this view as "ahistorical culturalism" (hirekishiteki- na "bunka " ron 4F tr, rIc4LI A). See Ryukyu ikoku no kozoJ MD, TE 4 CD (Yoshikawa k-obunkan, 1987), pp. 236-50. For Nakamatsu's views, see especially pp. 245-46.</page><page sequence="4">92 GREGORY SMITS The reason, simply stated, was that neither Satsuma nor the bakufu valued Ryukyu for its own sake, but for its connections with China. The complex question of early modern Ryukyu's political and cul- tural status remains contested and controversial, and a detailed ex- amination of this matter lies beyond the scope of the present study. The main point for our purposes is that the status of early modern Ryukyu was ambiguous not only for modern historians but also for Ryukyuans of the time.5 This ambiguity produced ideological strug- gles within the kingdom, some of which I examine here. Finally, with respect to terminology, I follow common practice in the Japanese-language literature, calling pre-1609 Ryukyu "Old-Ryu- kyu" (Ko-Ryuikyu MID*) and the post-1609 kingdom "early modern" (kinsei iAti) Ryukyu. INTERPRETING THE OMORO SOSHI The most important source for reconstructing the relationship be- tween religious thought and practice and political power in Old- Ryukyu is the Omoro so-shi S t L, a collection of poem-songs sometimes likened to Japan's ManyO-shuJ sIii . The Omoro soshi (hereafter shortened to Omoro) consists of 22 volumes, the first of which was compiled in 1531, the second in 1613, and most or all of the others in 1623 (the exact compilation date of four volumes is un- clear). The first volume is of particular importance because it con- tains nearly all of the major terms, concepts, and themes of the text as a whole, with later volumes tending to reiterate the material found in the first. The Omoro we have today, however, is not the original sixteenth- and seventeenth-century text, but one recon- structed from fragments in the personal archives of various scholars in 1710 after a palace fire had destroyed all complete copies of the text the previous year.6 5 On the question of early modern Ryukyuan identity, see Gregory Smits, Visions of Ryu- kyu.

Another is the often obscure language of the poem-songs. Sakima Toshikatsu points out that even at the time of the compilation of the first volume in the early sixteenth century, the poem-songs and their lan- guage were no longer a living tradition in Okinawa.7 The text con- tains a plethora of ancient terms that its compilers transcribed into Japanese spelling using mainly kana plus a small number of Chinese characters. These compilers, however, seem not to have known Japanese very well, and even the word omoro itself is the result of er- roneous application of conversion rules to the Okinawan term umuI.' In addition to grappling with linguistic and orthographic obsta- cles, interpreting the Omoro requires a knowledge of the broader historical context at the times of its compilation. For example, Saki- ma points out that its first volume was compiled during a time of great anxiety about the danger from wako- @W, pirate raids, which took place several times during the sixteenth century. Its frequently recurring themes of protection of the state and a longing for the bet- ter days of the past reflect a desire to escape from this danger.9 Like the Man yO-shuI or the Kojiki, the Omoro contains material pur- porting to have originated centuries before the text was compiled. The political circumstances at the time of its compilation, however, did much to shape the final product. The topic of Buddhism is a good example. In discussing the limits of the Omoro as an historical source, Ikemiya points out that it contains no mention of Bud- dhism, which played a major role in the cultural and political life of the court in Old-Ryukyu."0 In making this point, Ikemiya follows common practice among scholars of Ryukyu to situate the Omoro outside the realm of Buddhism. Sakima has criticized this practice at length and makes a convincing case that Shingon Buddhism 7 Sakima, Omoro no shiso, p. 13. 8 Mitsugu Sakihara, A Brief History of Early Okinawa Based on the Omoro (Honpo shoseki, 1987), pp. 3-5. 9 Sakima, Omoro no shfiso, pp. 13-14, 76. The wako were also a menace to the coast of China at this time. 10 Ikemiya, "0 to oken," p. 194.</page><page sequence="6">94 GREGORY SMITS informs much of the language and many of the ideas in the Omoro. One example he discusses is the word miya A the term that occurs most frequently to indicate religious sites. Standard reference works on the Omoro define miya as a courtyard A in which priestesses performed religious rites, a definition that dates back to the original notes to the Omoro and the first dictionary of Ryukyuan terms, the KonkokenshulRA P* of 1711. If maya meant courtyard, however, why does the Omoro speak of miya as having been "constructed" (kerahe in the language of the Omoro, but written as e v' or i), a verb that would not have made sense with a courtyard as its object? An analysis of examples of miya in the Ryuikyuikokuyuraiki (Record of the origins of Ryukyu VLUMFh* k), completed in 1713, indicates miya meant a shrine for a Buddhist avatar (gongensha *Nh). Fur- thermore, that honorifics modify miya in the Omoro rules out its being a courtyard since such honorifics would not be appropriate for the ground the priestesses trample with their feet. Sakima then con- siders the question of why the eighteenth-century compilers (and re- compilers) of the Omoro and the Konkokenshul regard miya as court- yards. He points out that a century had gone by since Satsuma's invasion, and it had been more than two centuries since most of the miya mentioned in the Omoro had been built. All that remained by the eighteenth century was the word "miya" and the courtyards of structures that in most cases no longer existed." In short, the Omoro often reflects the circumstances of Ryukyu in the eighteenth century despite the much older provenance of the poem-songs it contains. Sakima's broader argument is that Japanese Kumano gongen R'fl 4W, worship became widespread by the time of Sho Shin. It re- garded the Ryukyuan deities as Buddhist avatars and introduced Shingon rites into native religious practices. A good example is amagoi ~TiV, rites in which the high priestess would pray for rain (the Ryukyu islands are subject to periodic droughts). Shingon Bud- dhism excelled at such rites, and their appearance in the Omoro is one of many examples of Shingon influence on native religious prac- tices. For example: In today's shining sun The high priestess " Sakima, Omoro no shiso-, pp. 94-101.</page><page sequence="7">ROYAL AUTHORITY IN RYUKYU 95 The fallen rain for which she prayed is merciful rain And likewise in the miya in the palace grounds It is as if gold has rained down on the earth (#19).2 Similarly, an analysis of the names of the ten sacred groves (utaki gI Xk) indicates that they functioned analogously to the protective shrines associated with esoteric Buddhism in both the Chinese and Japanese imperial courts. Indeed, the Ryukyuan court's uses of Shingon practices and terminology served symbolically to place its sovereign on a par with those of its larger neighbors. This lofty sta- tus is the main reason for the frequent uses of multiple honorific prefixes (as many as four) with words associated with the royal court. It also explains the use of the term dairi NW in similar contex- ts, a term that in Japanese texts referred to the customary residence of an emperor."3 Clearly Shingon Buddhism was a major part of the ideological foundation of the early kingdom, and there is ample evidence that Kumano gongen worship came into the Ryukyu islands from Japan even before the establishment of a centralized kingdom."4 By the time of the Omoro 's reconstruction in the eighteenth century, however, and probably much earlier, specific Shingon-derived "na- tive" Ryukyuan religious practices such as amagoi rites had come to be seen as so naturally and obviously Ryukyuan that their Buddhist origins had been forgotten. SHO SHIN AND THE CREATION OF ROYAL IDEOLOGY"5 The beneficiary of palace intrigues, Sho Shin spent most of his roughly half century reign carrying out institutional and ideological 12 In citing quotations from the Omoro so-shi, the song number in parentheses is based on Hokama Shuzen Mol Omoro so-shi 4 i 3 L (Kadokawa shoten, 1993), whose num- bering corresponds with the standard version of the text.

Many of his reforms resembled those of Toyotomi Hideyoshi and the early Tokugawa shoguns a century later. Sho Shin established his capital at Shuri - and placed all Okinawan weapons in royal arsenals. He required the aji to leave their ancestral lands and take up perma- nent residence in Shuri. To replace them, Sho Shin established a sys- tem of local officials appointed by and responsible to the central government. Most important for our purposes is that Sho Shin at- tempted to reorganize religious life to enhance royal power.16 In the process, he created new institutions and an ideology in which to ground them-creations that Ryukyuans of later centuries and many modern historians came to regard as ancient tradition dating back to the thirteenth or fourteenth centuries. Although priestesses had participated in state ceremony prior to his reign, Sho Shin established a formal hierarchy of female religious officials that paralleled and supplemented the male hierar- chy of central and local government officials. The top post was that of high priestess, to which Sho Shin appointed his sister. Her posi- tion and prestige was comparable to that of the king. Immediately under the high priestess was a group of officials with titles contain- ing the suffix -kimi (e.g., Shuri-ogimi t6flL$), collectively known as kimigimi RE. This class of religious officials corresponded to the highest officers of state and were known in ordinary speech as the "thirty-three kimi" - a name that resonates with the Bud- dhist Heaven of the Thirty-three Deities (J. sanju-san ten +-X. or toriten 1I)). The next class of religious officials, titled amu WX or oamu tkIiJfU, oversaw religious activities in set geographic areas and corresponded to the aji. One o-amu typically oversaw the religious ac- tivities of islands other than Okinawa and corresponded to court-ap- pointed governors. Sho Shin devoted considerable effort to con- solidating Okinawan control of the other Ryukyu islands, and the appointment of o-amu to regulate religious rites was an integral part of the process. The most numerous officials were the noro (e x5, Vk 16 For more details about Sh6 Shin's reforms, see Takara, Rytikyut no jidai, pp. 199-224; and George H. Kerr, Okinawa. The History of an Island People (Rutland, VT: Charles E. Tuttle Co., 1958), pp. 104-116. Although it is common to attribute the many institutional changes that took place during Sho Shin's reign to the king himself (following official monuments and inscriptions, the main type of source for the period), the extent to which others around the king may have conceived of or carried out these changes is a topic in need of further research.</page><page sequence="9">ROYAL AUTHORITY IN RYUKYU 97 and other characters), pronounced nuru in Okinawan. They per- formed state-sanctioned rites within jurisdictions ranging in size from one to several villages. The noro brought the authority of the court to the level of individual villages and may even have assisted in the collection of taxes.17 While there is widespread agreement on the formal aspects of the hierarchy of religious officials that Sh6 Shin established, the ques- tion of its ideological basis has generated several overlapping yet different theories. The work of Nakamura Akira and Higa Minoru sets forth the major concepts and issues in the royal ideology of Old- Ryukyu. This work has been partially revised by China Teikan, Sakima Toshikatsu, and by Tonaki Akira's work on Old-Ryukyuan stone monuments. While all of these scholars have contributed sig- nificantly to our understanding of royal authority in the early Ryu- kyu kingdom, I agree with Sakima that the Shingon Buddhist contri- bution to royal ideology deserves greater emphasis. Nakamura and Higa see Sho Shin's reign as a time of transition from one paradigm of solar worship to another. In this view, solar worship had long been a key element in Ryukyuan political ideolo- gy. The aji, for example, often adopted titles containing the word teda, and the Omoro provides a wealth of evidence for early solar wor- ship among the people of Okinawa. The object of this worship was not the sun in its totality, but the sun in the east as it rose to start the new day. The setting sun in the west was regarded as inauspicious, linked with old age, decline, and demise. In actual political prac- tice, aji and later the early kings were regarded as possessing the power to influence the forces of nature for the benefit of their group. Furthermore, there is strong circumstantial evidence that local populations or rivals to power frequently overthrew ruling warlords whose physical and spiritual power seemed to be on the wane. The general term for this early form of solar worship is wakateda shiso -t W;,, "young sun ideology." Sh6 Shin found wakateda shiso problematic as a basis for royal authority and promoted a different conception of the relationship be- tween ruler and sun called tedako shiso tM-T!8,1LP, "son of the sun ide- oloc.v" Furthermore, the term tedako and its equivalents were used 17 Nakamura Akira, "Ryuikyiu okoku keisei no shiso: seiji shisoshi no ikku to shite" ;JPiUFE U L \ D-1 L 1, Okinawa bunka kenkyu - LX7 f/, no. 1 (1974), p. 62.</page><page sequence="10">98 GREGORY SMITS only in reference to the king from Sho Shin's time onward. When work began on the Omoro in the 1530s, the compilers included poem-songs celebrating Eiso *&amp; (r. 1260-1299) as the first king of Okinawa and the first earthly descendant of the solar deity. Portions of the text explicitly link the present line of kings (the second Sho dy- nasty) to Eiso, and thus to the sun. Tedako ideology was inspired by the Chinese idea of heaven (tian X) and Chinese-inspired concep- tions of the ruler as son-of-heaven. As Higa points out, one could substitute the words teda and heaven in the Omoro in most cases with no change in meaning.18 Tedako ideology, of course, would have also resonated with Japanese tales of imperial origins. Because female spiritual power was deeply entrenched in Ryu- kyuan society at many levels, creating an ideology of rulership draw- ing on Okinawan traditions of solar worship required Sho Shin to es- tablish his system of female religious officials. While he also utilized Buddhism and Chinese theories of rulership, these male-centered traditions did little to undermine the importance of the high priestess and her subordinates. In short, to portray themselves as so- lar descendants or representatives in a convincing manner, the kings of Old-Ryukyu formed symbiotic relationships with women who could serve as intermediaries between king and sun. A widespread form of folk religion throughout the Ryukyu islands was onarigami belief (Sk , UP). An onarigami is a woman whose sha- manic powers protect a male relative from earthly and supernatural malevolent forces. The typical situation would be a sister protecting a brother, though another female relative could serve as onarigami in the absence of a sister. Sho Shin's establishment of the system of fe- male religious officials, with his sister as high priestess, can be re- garded as institutionalizing onarigami belief for the benefit of the monarch and his government. In a study of royal ideology and solar worship, China Teikan ar- gued convincingly that tedako thought was an adaptation of wakateda thought rather than a sharp break with it. Wakateda thought was widespread throughout Okinawa as part of popular belief. Ordinary people deified the sun, and we find many poem-songs in the Omoro 18 Ibid., esp. pp. 69-73; and Higa Minoru k T, Ko-Ryukyu no shiso , (Na- ha: Okinawa taimususha, 1991), a collection of previously published essays, esp. pp. 52-93 and, regarding Chinese-derived notions of heaven, pp. 97-110.</page><page sequence="11">ROYAL AUTHORITY IN RYUKYU 99 that liken aji to the sun. As part of his project to strengthen the monarchy, Sho Shin created tedako ideology, the idea of king as descendant of the sun. The two forms of solar religion were closely connected and elements of both continued to play major roles in roy- al ideology and the ceremonial embodiment of that ideology. While China agrees that Chinese conceptions of heaven were an important part of royal ideology and surely complemented its other compo- nents, he finds insufficient evidence that they helped create tedako ideology.'9 China's line of argument can be significantly expanded in the light of Sakima's view that many of the key terms and concepts in the Omoro are of Japanese Shingon derivation. Sakima asserts (as have others) that the Okinawan term teda derives from the Sino- Japanese tento- (or tendo .A.), which had the two meanings of "ruler of heaven and earth" and "the sun," and which was also a name for the solar Buddha, Dainichi nyorai ik H 4n* (Vairocana), the cen- tral deity of Shingon.20 Kikoe-o-gimi, which became the title of the high priestess in Sho Shin's time, was originally another name for teda and therefore Dainichi nyorai. In its early Okinawan context it meant something like "the great deity [ =solar deity] who, of its own accord, hears the supplications of the noro. " Even after kikoe-ogi- mi became the title of the high priestess, the term did not entirely lose its earlier meaning. The high priestess functioned in two differ- ent modes: as the guardian deity of Okinawan folk religion (onariga- mi) and as an avatar of the sun-as-deity (tedashitro tM). It was Shingon Buddhism that made the second role possible.2' Through- out the history of the Ryukyu kingdom, Shingon and the Rinzai school of Zen were the only forms of Buddhism to establish a formal presence. Both came to Ryukyu from Japan. Let us summarize the major ideological and religious elements that contributed to royal authority during the time of Sho Shin. The tedako ideology portraying the king as a descendant of the sun drew upon two aspects of Okinawan religion: belief in the restorative, 19 China Teikan 016'T3t, "Okinawa no Taiyoshinko to 6ken: 'tedako' shiso no keisei katei ni tsuite" AOZA-1I - -r j 1EcO;t t -r-M ,W &lt; , t XKubo Norita- da sensei Okinawa chosa nijuinen kinen ronbunshu kanko iinkai, ed., Okinawa no sh-ky-to mi- zoku 0AD' LR ; (Daiichi shobo, 1988), pp. 101-122. 20 Sakima, Omoro no shiso-, pp. 65-67. 21 Ibid., pp. 20-24, 116-17.</page><page sequence="12">100 GREGORY SMITS life-giving power of the rising sun and belief in the power of women to protect male relatives. Chinese conceptions of the ruler as the son-of-heaven, mediating between cosmic forces and the world of humans, also contributed to tedako ideology. Japan was the source of the idea of the royal family as descendants of the sun-as-deity (amater- asu i0P,) and of Shingon Buddhism, whose central deity, the solar Buddha, manifests itself in various forms according to the honji- suijaku *,A doctrine. In the case of Ryukyu, however, it was not always clear whether the king or the high priestess (or both) was an avatar of the solar Buddha. A study of stone monuments, the primary external manifestation of royal authority in Old-Ryukyu, sheds further light on its ideologi- cal and religious basis. The oldest extant monument was created in 1427. Between 1456 and 1459, the royal government erected thirty- three more monuments, of which eighteen are extant. Written in classical Chinese, the inscriptions on these monuments were carved by Buddhist monks and portrayed Ryukyu's kings as paragons of Buddhist virtue and as avatars. Later, during the reign of Sho Shin, Buddhist virtue remained a major theme in official monuments. The king, for example, was characterized as a believer in the Three Jewels and in the Buddhas. His accomplishments included the con- struction of a Buddhist sanctuary and numerous temples. But we also find the king portrayed as a sage in the manner of Chinese state Confucianism. Qilin, lions, tigers, dragons, and other creatures of symbolic importance in Chinese lore adorn the royal monuments from this time. China and its culture are portrayed not only as a model for rulership but also as exerting a beneficial effect on Ryu- kyuan cultural forms generally.22 In short, these monuments indi- cate that both Buddhism and a Chinese state Confucian model of rulership had become key elements in Ryukyuan royal ideology dur- ing the reign of Sho Shin. Another result of Sho Shin's efforts to strengthen royal authority was his construction of Enkakuji F19T. Completed in 1495, the Rinzai Zen temple was built to enshrine Sho En F'F9 (r. 1470-1476), founder of the second Sho dynasty. The monuments mentioning or 22 Tonaki Akira 9 I&amp;J1, "Ko-Ryuikyui oken no messeiji: kinsekibun kara mita" T IEWfrQ) y t-L - ig Qk,:, Shin Okinawa bungaku PuiZ;, no. 85 (Fall, 1990), pp. 54-57.</page><page sequence="13">ROYAL AUTHORITY IN RYUKYU 101 commemorating the construction of Enkakuji portray it as a tangi- ble manifestation of Sho Shin's virtue. The Omoro also contains a verse celebrating the temple's construction: That which Sho Shin planned The construction of Enkakuji As the prayers accumulate, teda is pleased That which the king planned The high priestess reveres The construction of shrines and temples (miyadera #) The royal priestesses (kimigimi) revere High and low are united Distant places are united The purifying water of shrines and temples Offer up to Sh6 Shin The coming of many generations and many years. (#283) Tonaki Akira is struck by the difference between this Omoro passage and the text of monuments. Although both praise Sh6 Shin's con- struction of Enkakuji, the Omoro verse reflects no influence of Bud- dhism or Confucianism, he says, while the text of the monument makes no mention of female officials or native Okinawan religion.23 Certainly the Omoro verse does not reflect Confucian influence, but the verse celebrates the creation of a major temple (the term miyadera clearly includes Buddhist temples), and the prayers offered therein please teda, the Ryukyuan solar deity and, following Sakima, a form of the solar Buddha. It therefore seems more appropriate to say that the Omoro passage reflects native Ryukyuan religion within the broader framework of Buddhism as appropriated by the royal court. However, Tonaki's basic point of a disjunction between the classi- cal Chinese of the monuments and those texts written in (Japanese- influenced) Okinawan is valid and important. This disjunction shar- pened in the early sixteenth century when, during the reign of Sho Sei Aii (r. 1527-1555), it became standard practice to inscribe monuments in classical Chinese on one side and Okinawan on the other. There was also a brief period, around the first two decades of the sixteenth century, when monuments appeared written only in 23 Ibid., pp. 57-58.</page><page sequence="14">102 GREGORY SMITS Okinawan. Here, too, Tonaki argues for a complete separation of the rhetoric of native religion and female officials, which comprises the Okinawan-language inscriptions, and the Buddhist-Confucian rhetoric of the Chinese texts.24 It is true that the texts in classical Chinese make no mention of native Okinawan religious concepts or the activities of female officials. The Okinawan-language texts, however, do sometimes speak of Buddhism. For example, a six- teenth-century monument commemorating the completion of a road connecting Shuri and Shimajiri describes the celebratory activi- ties of 300 Buddhist monks in addition to those of the priestesses. This counterexample notwithstanding, Tonaki is correct to con- clude that Ryukyuan monuments reflect a general bifurcation be- tween native and foreign underpinnings of royal ideology.25 Another possible aspect of this bifurcation can be seen in the decorative carving adorning the top of official monuments and tablets. In addition to dragons, cranes, and other auspicious crea- tures from Chinese lore, starting with Sh6 Shin's reign we find a cir- cular solar orb surrounded by clouds adorning the center of the decorative area of some monuments (see Figure 1).

There can be little doubt that tedako ideology was a discursive creation during the reign of Sho0 Shin and that it became firmly entrenched during Sho Sei's reign, when it was also given textual embodiment in the Omoro. Perhaps the most significant feature of the tedako ideological synthesis was that it obscured the boundaries between many of its major compo- nents or entities. AMBIGUOUS BOUNDARIES: KING, PRIESTESS, SUN Historians and other scholars of Old-Ryukyu often identify the high priestess or the system of female religious officials as the most distinctive institutional component of royal authority.26 While wom- en have played prominent roles in folk religions throughout East Asia, the case of Ryukyu is unique in that women occupied high office as part of the official structure of government. By Sho Shin's time, the basic tenet of Japanese imperial ideol- ogy-emperor as living descendant of the solar deity Amaterasu- would have been widely known among Ryukyuan elites. A similar claim for the Ryukyuan monarch-king as living descendant of teda-might have been an ideal ideological move. Indeed, such a relationship is suggested in tedako ideology, but why complicate mat- ters by having female intermediaries play a central role in the king- sun linkage? There were at least two likely reasons. One, mentioned above, was the strong belief in the spiritual superiority of women in Ryukyuan folk religion, the most important manifestation being women as onarigami. The second was the lack of any tradition of an anthropomorphic solar deity in Ryukyuan folk religion. The rising sun in the east, the source of life and vitality, was itself the object of veneration. Female intermediaries, therefore, were necessary to forge elements of Ryukyuan folk religion into a plausible royal ideology. A common topic of inquiry among scholars of Old-Ryukyu is the precise nature of the relationship between sun, priestess, and king. 26 See, for example, Tonaki Akira, Taba Yumio F3tb# , and Tomiyama Kazuyuki, "Ryufkyiu oken no tokushitsu o saguru" ; Shin Okinawa bungaku, no. 85 (Fall, 1990), p. 43.</page><page sequence="16">104 GREGORY SMITS Closely connected with this topic is the question of power. Simply stated, who was stronger, the king or high priestess? Certainly the passage from the Mirror of Chu-zan at the start of this essay suggests that priestesses may have possessed sufficient power to oust a king. Did institutionalizing the roles of these women during Sho0 Shin's reign increase their power vis-a-vis that of the king or place it under royal control? Examining the many references to king and priestess in the Omoro does not provide a clear answer. In his thorough study of Omoro motifs, Tamaki Masami points out the many roles of priestesses that appear in the song-poems. Priestesses protect ships, sailors, the king, the country, lower-rank- ing priestesses, male government officials, sacred places, buildings, gates, rice, society in general, and more.27 Although the details vary widely with circumstances, priestesses perform their protective roles by shamanic traveling, sometimes to obtain power and sometimes to go to where their help is needed. Focusing on the high priestess and king, Tamaki constructs a composite of this process by combin- ing elements from different song-poems. First, the high priestess travels to and resides in the "other world" (takai ffiW), the land of obotsu-kagura B &lt;-c 6,, the divine realm of the sun high in the sky, where she acquires spiritual power. The king invites her to return to a sacred site on earth, and he transmits this message via the hearth deity (J. hi-no-kami XP, orjii-nu-kang in Okinawan). She then leaves obotsu-kagura and descends to a sacred site at which the king orders large fans waved and a drum beaten. After her arrival, she transfers the power obtained in obotsu-kagura (the most common term for which is seji - L) to the king via a ritual process called kami- asobi *5Y. The goal of this process is for the high priestess to pro- tect the king by strengthening his power. The Omoro commonly uses the verb "to know" X 6, in the meaning of high priestess aiding the king. The idea here seems to be that the object of her conscious at- tention comes under her protection. By strengthening the king through the transfer of spiritual power, the high priestess ensures the smooth operation of society.28 Insofar as royal authority is discur- 27 Tamaki Masami TW&amp;Jk, Nanto kayo ron XA tffin (Sunakoya shobo, 1991), pp. 193-94, 224-25, 238, 266-91. 28 Ibid., pp. 519-37.</page><page sequence="17">ROYAL AUTHORITY IN RYUKYU 105 sively produced, the high priestess played a major role in the process in Old-Ryukyu. In numerous Omoro passages, the king prays to or otherwise honors the high priestess and, just as often, the high priestess prays to and exalts the king.29 The relationship between king and high priestess was characterized by what Ikemiya calls a "dual nature." On the one hand, in his capacity as king-as-solar descendant, he was the source of authority for Ryukyu's female officials. But he was also dependent on the protection of the high priestess in her onariga- mi-like role. The king was both protector and protected, and the high priestess and other religious officials both offered prayers to dei- ties and were the object of the prayers of others.30 The boundaries be- tween king and sun, king and high priestess, spiritual power and earthly authority, high priestess and deity, superior and subor- dinate, and, in some respects, male and female were often elided or blurred in the royal court of Old-Ryukyu. Ambiguous boundaries abounded. All evidence suggests that these overlapping, ambiguous bounda- ries functioned to strengthen royal authority vis-a-vis the aji and pos- sibly other claimants to the throne. The king and high priestess formed a symbiotic relationship from the time of Sho Shin, and there is no sign of any conflict between them. The major potential threats to royal power during the reigns of Sho Shin and Sho Sei were the aji and pirate attacks respectively. The high priestess and the system of female religious officials strengthened royal authority, and to compare the relative power of king versus high priestess is to ask the wrong question. Instead, within the broader context of possi- ble challenges to the king's power, we should focus on his relation- ship with sun-as-deity and how the high priestess facilitated it.3" Sho Shin's adoption and uses of tedako ideology were part of a broader project of consolidating royal power and weakening that of the aji. He sought to clarify the boundaries between king and aji, but he had no such concern with respect to the boundaries between king, 29 Ibid., pp. 256-376. 30 Ikemiya, "O to Oken," p. 206. 31 Tonaki, Taba, and Tomiyama, " Ryuikyt no oken," p. 31; and Tamaki, Kayo ron, pp. 537-46.</page><page sequence="18">106 GREGORY SMITS priestess, and sun. Indeed, the blurring of these boundaries worked toward the king's benefit. AMBIGUOUS BOUNDARIES: RYUKYU, JAPAN, CHINA During the reigns of Sho Shin and Sho Sei, Ryukyu prospered ow- ing to extensive foreign trade. By the end of the sixteenth century, this trade had dropped off sharply, Ryukyu's economy was depressed, and the threat of invasion from Japan loomed large.32 The turmoil of Japan's wars of reunification delayed that invasion until 1609. Ryukyu had not kept up with the latest developments in military technology, and its defenses, while adequate to ward off pirates attacking Naha from the sea, were no match for the mobile, battle-hardened soldiers of Satsuma and their firearms. Knowing its material strength was inadequate, the royal court hoped that the spiritual power of its priestesses and the deities with which they in- teracted would be sufficient to repulse the invaders. Ryukyu's rapid defeat strained, but did not destroy, the tedako ideology Sho Shin had created a century earlier.33 Whether or to what extent Ryukyu became part of Japan from 1609 onward remains a contentious issue, particularly between com- 32 By the 1590s if not earlier, Ryukyuan elites were aware of the possibility of an invasion. A passage in the So lineage records (So-uji kafu ; for example, reads: "Sometimes we would hear of an impending attack from Satsuma. So on the twentieth day of the twelfth month, 1593, ships set out from Tomari to offer prayers from Okinawa to the five northern is- lands." Quoted in Itokazu Kaneharu I "Sai On to Shushigaku: Kinsei Ryuikyui ni okeru sono shisoshijo no ichizuke" a *T* - iOtDt 1 KDV5t, Shimajiri Katsutaro, Kadena Shutoku, Toguchi Masakiyo san sensei no koki kinen ronshui kanko iinkai AI7EKF g 6 g it=$ iEAn it t4 A eds., Kyuyo ronso JZjA (Naha: Hirugisha, 1986), p. 268. 33 The records of Chinese investiture envoys to Ryukyu clearly indicate the royal court's reliance on protective deities to make up for the kingdom's lack of military power. The investi- ture envoy for Sho Tei M., (r. 1669-1709), WangJi fIEtF, for example, reports a conversa- tion between then investiture envoy Xia Ziyang ATf- and King Sho Nei Mj% (r. 1587- 1620) in 1606 about defense preparations and the possibility of an invasion from Japan. The king acknowledged the possibility of an invasion and that Ryukyuan military strength was weak, but he assured Xia that the female deities who had protected Ryukyu in the past would do so again. Wang then points out that soon thereafter an invasion did take place and the king and leading minister became prisoners of Japan. When the king returned, he blamed one dei- ty for the calamity and, although he continued to perform extensive religious rites, he never venerated that deity again.

A major difficulty is the tendency to apply modern conceptions of national sovereignty to Ryukyu and Japan of the seventeenth through nineteenth centu- ries. By modern reckoning, the evidence of Ryukyu's status is am- biguous: the kingdom was both a part of Japan and apart from Japan. The question of Ryukyu's status is too complex to address here, but it will be sufficient to point out that the kingdom of Ryukyu con- tinued to exist until 1879. It was under Japanese domination but, because of international developments within East Asia, especially the rise of the Qing dynasty, it retained a substantial degree of au- tonomy. Direct Japanese presence in Ryukyu was limited to one offi- cial from Satsuma and his small staff. On the other hand, Ryu- kyuan intellectuals and political leaders of the time were always aware of Satsuma's potential power. Furthermore, Ryukyuan elites themselves were often uncertain of the relationship between Ryu- kyu, different parts of Japan such as Satsuma and the bakufu, and the Qing empire. They responded to Japanese domination by con- structing new visions of Ryukyu, although they based these visions on ideological foundations that differed significantly from those of modern nationalism. As a result of Ryukyu's ambiguous status af- ter 1609, the issue of identity, broadly defined, became a major, on- going concern among Ryukyu's elites. Intellectual and political de- bate and conflict in Ryukyu during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was largely the result of competing visions of what Ryu- kyu was or should be.34 One result of this conflict was the marginali- zation of tedako ideology and the priestesses. Itokazu Kaneharu argues that this marginalization took place quickly: "Belief in the deities vanished before the hard, cold fact of defeat in war. " He characterizes the first half of the seventeenth cen- tury as a time when the old ideological pillars had been destroyed and, in a state of confusion, Ryukyuans searched for new values.35 While Itokazu is correct to portray immediate post-invasion Ryu- kyu as a time of confusion, it is not clear that the war destroyed tedako ideology. Certainly it left unchanged the popular forms of 34 For a complete analysis of this matter, see Smits, Visions of Ryukyu. 3 Itokazu, "Sai On to Shushigaku," pp. 264-65.</page><page sequence="20">108 GREGORY SMITS folk religion from which parts of the ideology were derived. Indeed, the war had little or no direct impact on the lives of most ordinary Ryukyuans. Nor did the war make any immediate changes in Ryu- kyuan Buddhism or the general prestige of Chinese-derived models of rulership. Satsuma did issue general injunctions against con- structing "excessive" numbers of shrines and temples. It also re- quired the royal court to enforce a strict ban on Christianity and the ikko - 01 sect of Pure Land Buddhism. Otherwise, however, Satsu- ma was little concerned with religious or intellectual activities wi- thin Ryukyu. All evidence indicates that the Ryukyuan royal court continued to follow the general theory and practice of the older tedako ideology throughout the seventeenth century. There were changes, however, particularly during the tenure in office of Sho0 Shoken 1 (1617-1675), a reform-minded official who was prime minister from 1666-1673.36 Sho Shoken saw Ryu- kyu's proper role as that of loyal vassal of Satsuma. One result of this vision was that he strove to reform government administration and popular customs so that Ryukyuans would appear culturally respect- able to Satsuma's critical eye. In Haneji shioki i4Jf, a collection of Sho5 Shoken's directives and his reasons for them, he frequently described practices and customs of his day as "wasteful," "benight- ed," "stupid in the extreme," or otherwise inappropriate. Some- times he expressed embarrassment about the way Ryukyuan prac- tices might appear to officials from Satsuma: for example, "As word of the lax attitudes of our officials toward public service has even reached Satsuma, it is an unavoidable shame for the whole coun- try. "37 Likewise, the high status of women in Ryukyu' s government and the occasional ritual subordination of the king to the high priestess disturbed Sho Shoken. Although they had the enthusiastic backing of Satsuma's officials, 36 Sh6 Shoken's name is also pronounced "ShoJoken" and "Sho Zoken." The character "Sh6" ([X) is that of the royal family, PjM, with two strokes removed for modesty. He is also known as Haneji Choshui 1l*!*A or Haneji oji 1PTIf (Prince Haneji). The post of "prime minister" is sessei (shissh/ii in Okinawan) #Kj&amp;, the highest office other than that of the king and available only to royal relatives. It should not be confused with the post of sessho/ in Japanese imperial politics. 3 Haneji shioki in Okinawa-ken Okinawa shiryo henshuijo . eds., Okinawa-ken shiryo, zen kindai 1: Shuri ofu shioki , F 0j1Jtf 1-_6ER! ff?t (Na- ha: Okinawa-ken kyoiku iinkai, 1981), p. 55.</page><page sequence="21">ROYAL AUTHORITY IN RYUKYU 109 many of Sho Shoken's reforms faced significant opposition from wi- thin Ryukyuan officialdom. As a result, his approach was not an at- tempt to abolish practices he disliked but to modify them. For exam- ple, when the king participated in religious rites with the high priestess, he often played a ritually subordinate role owing to the en- trenched belief in female spiritual superiority. In such cases, Sho Sh6ken sought to end the king's direct participation in rites conduct- ed by the high priestess. The following passage from the Kyuiyo , an official history of Ryukyu, reflects this approach: "For the first time, changes were made such that the king's official visit to the palace of the high priestess was stopped. [In his place,] an envoy was dispatched to serve as a representative celebrant at the various sacred rites."38 Not only did this move downgrade the importance of the rites, it significantly increased the distance between the activi- ties of the king and those of the high priestess. Likewise, Sho Shoken ended the custom of royal participation in the most sacred of Ryukyu's native rites, the biannual worship at Kudakajima Xa , ,!b a small island off the coast from Chinen X,2 in southern Okina- wa. The rites celebrated the spontaneous generation of grain on the island, thought to have been a gift from the native deities. Sho Shoken argued that grain came to Ryukyu from Japan, not from the deities, and that royal participation was costly, dangerous, and undignified. In particular, he said that royal worship at Kudakaji- ma was not based on any "wise or sagely teaching" and should peo- ple from "great countries" see the sovereign worshiping with priestesses, they would "laugh with derision."39 Here, too, the rites themselves were not abolished. Instead, a royal representative took the king's place. Another important move by Sho Shoken reduced the prestige of the noro, the most numerous rank of female officials. After 1667, noro no longer received jireisho f, official writs of appointment. This change took place within the context of governmental reorganiza- tion of official ceremony and reflected a lowering of the status of the noro.0 Arguing that the practice was indecorous, Sho Shoken pro- hibited female officials from conveying official messages and formal 38 Kyufy6 kenkyufkai 3 ed., Kyiyo-, (Kadokawa shoten, 1974), #464. 3 See Haneji shlioki, pp. 43-45, for the text of the full argument. 4 Takara Kurayoshi, Ryuikyu- okoku no ko-zo, pp. 50-56.</page><page sequence="22">110 GREGORY SMITS notices of appointment between the king and top male officials.4' Soon after Sho Shoken left office, the royal government instituted a policy whereby the queen, not the king's sister, served as high priestess.42 Not only was the queen's status clearly lower than that of the king, but the change also weakened the onarigami aspect of the king-high priestess relationship. Furthermore, the vagueness inher- ent in tedako ideology concerning the relationship between king, priestess, and sun became more problematic with the priestess no longer a close blood relative of the king. Issues of ideology were not of primary importance for Sho Shoken. Seventeenth-century Ryukyu was beset by a host of press- ing economic problems, and Sho Shoken sought to address them in a straightforward manner. He initiated policies to boost agricultural production such as tax incentives to bring new farmland into cultiva- tion. Likewise, he reduced what he regarded as a waste of resources by simplifying both official government ceremony and private rites within elite families. As part of an effort to encourage Ryukyuan elites to embrace his vision of Ryukyu as Satsuma's vassal, Sho Shoken sought to reduce the cultural distance between Ryukyu and Satsuma. One aspect of this cultural realignment was lowering the formal status of female officials vis-'a-vis their male counterparts and eliminating aspects of royal ceremony in which the king played a ritually equal or subordinate role to the high priestess. Sho Shoken's reforms significantly weakened tedako ideology, but they did not attempt to replace it with anything else. It was at the end of the seventeenth century and throughout most of the eighteenth that a Chinese-derived state Confucian model of rulership steadily displaced tedako ideology. Starting at the end of the seventeenth century, the king began to perform Chinese-style rites venerating heaven as part of the annual cycle of court cere- mony. Prior to this time, Shingon and Zen monks from Japan played a major role in Ryukyuan rites, and this legacy continued to be reflected in the earliest forms of the new royal ceremony. For ex- 41 Haneji shioki, pp. 4-6; Takara Kurayoshi, "Sho Shoken no ronri" 3 Shin Ryu-kyu-shi, kinsei hen VIfit iyWs, vol. 1 (Naha: Ryuikyui shinposha, 1989), pp. 165-66; and Takara Kurayoshi, Ryuikyu- o-kokushi no kadai ,%tJ* T (Naha: Hirugisha, 1990), p. 219. 42 Takara, Ryuikyu o-kokushi no kadai, p. 219.</page><page sequence="23">ROYAL AUTHORITY IN RYUKYU 111 ample, the king performed rites on the day of the new year facing whichever direction court diviners deemed most propitious. The de- termination of an auspicious direction was not part of similar ceremony in China and was part of an older tradition of Japanese- derived yin-yang divination (onmyo-dd- [ij) that Buddhist monks had performed. In the early eighteenth century, however, there was a conscious attempt on the part of Ryukyuan leaders to remove such Japanese influences from royal ceremony. In 1719, for example, the king always performed the ne-no-ho- 'f HXj new year's rites facing due north, in the direction of Beijing's Forbidden City for the explicit purpose of showing respect to the Chinese emperor.43 Although there were some differences in the way the Ryukyuan king and the Chinese emperor venerated heaven, the Ryukyuan rites were clear- ly a modified copy of Chinese state ceremony. From time to time Ryukyuan Confucian scholars objected to the king's ritual venera- tion of heaven since doing so was properly the task only of the Chinese emperor. Tomiyama argues that the reason royal venera- tion of heaven continued in Ryukyu (unlike Yi-dynasty Korea) despite the objections of some Confucians was that the king had long performed similar rites under the older tedako ideology. In other words, royal veneration of heaven in the eighteenth century was a continuation of the long Ryukyuan tradition of royal solar worship, since heaven and teda had long been interchangeable. Thus, tedako ideology, although largely displaced, continued to ex- ert a subtle influence on Ryukyu's new state ceremony. There was, however, a significant difference. The explicitly Chinese form now excluded women from playing a central role in the rites.44 By examining the official posthumous portraits of the kings (ogoe lX*I) we see quite vividly the change in royal image from tedako to a Chinese-style sage. Although these portraits were all destroyed during the Battle of Okinawa, ten have survived in the form of pho- tographs. Those from the reign of Sho En MiF1 (r. 1470-1476) through the reign of Sho Ho M (r. 1621-1640) are of similar de- sign, with the king in Ming-style robes and crown. The royal figure is about four times larger than those of surrounding attendants and 4 Tomiyama, Okengirei, pp. 195-99.

Photographs of the portraits of the two kings following Sho Ho are not available. Sho Tei's portrait, which would have been completed in the first decade of the eighteenth century, differs significantly from that of earlier kings (see Figure 3). The solar-lunar standing screen is gone, though its frame is still visible. The king is now nearly eight times larger than his attendants and ministers. His crown is the same as before, but his robes feature Qing-style decoration around the edges. On the floor in front of the king is a tripod vessel, a classical Chinese symbol of the authority of the ruler and a particularly important symbol in Qing imperial sacrifice.45 The portraits of kings after Sho Tei contain these same features, but lack even the suggestion of the former solar-lunar standing screen (see Figure 4). The king's robes are fully Qing in style, featuring five-clawed decorative dragons, with four-clawed dragons adorning the fans held by the attendants. The five-clawed dragon was reserved for the robes of the emperor at the Chinese court, and its appearance on the robes of the later Ryu- kyuan kings was part of their official portrayal in the manner of Chinese sovereigns. Finally, the Ming-style crown contains addi- tional jewels from Sho Boku's M (r. 1752-1795) portrait onward (see Figure 5).46 These portraits along with the changes in royal ceremony indi- cate a general trend to enhance the authoritative image of the king vis-a-vis other Ryukyuan elites. We see the king in the role of a Chinese-style sage, a small-scale emperor. By the eighteenth centu- ry, the king was no longer associated with the sun in official representations (with one exception to be discussed below) and rites. Tedako ideology, while lingering on in limited areas or as a ves- tige, had become displaced by Chinese-derived state Confucianism. Women were now absent from the center of state ceremony and ideology. 4 Regarding vessels and Qing imperial symbolism, see Angela Zito, Of Body and Brush: Grand Sacrifice as Text/Performance in Eighteenth-Century China (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1997), esp. p. 46. 46 For an analysis of the royal posthumous portraits, see Tomiyama Kazuyuki, "Ogoe kara mita Ryufkyul oken" M&amp; ,t cAktE, Takara Kurayoshi, Tomiyama Kazuyuki, and Maehira Fusaaki 0 , , Atarashii Ryuikyu-shi zo-: Araki Moriaki sensei tsuito- ronbunshu- 3fi LA 'tt?-Atm78tjg$g5!;t (Naha: Yojusha, 1996), pp. 61-74.</page><page sequence="25">113 I_~~~~~~PI &lt;iv, , y Figure 2: Posthumous portrait of Sho Ho.

Ryukyu's most intense period of sinicization took place when the kingdom was under Japanese political domination. However, Ryukyu's Japanese overlords were not concerned that the kingdom or its inhabitants adopt Japanese customs or culture. On the contrary, Ryukyu's primary value to Japan, both to the domain of Satsuma and to the bakufu, was as a conduit to China for goods and information.47 It was to Japan's advantage for Ryukyu's elites to adopt Chinese cultural forms in the early modern period. From the standpoint of many Ryukyuan political leaders, the eight- eenth-century enhancement of royal authority and transformation of the king's image into that of a Chinese-style sage were motivated by Ryukyu's ambiguous political status at the boundaries of the Chinese and Japanese political orders. The long history of the royal institution became a key tenet of early modern Ryukyuan identity. FEMALE OFFICIALS AS TECHNICIANS In 1784, word reached the king that a famine threatened Okina- wa because of insect infestation of sweet potatoes. He asked the highest government body, the Council of Three (Sanshikan _J Y2) about performing rites to ward off insects. After the council investi- gated local conditions, it reported back to the king that better weed- ing and fertilizing would be more effective in this case. The king agreed, but insect problems continued, encouraged by unfavorable weather conditions. So the king again suggested ritual action, and, this time, the council agreed. The king ordered the high priestess and the noro of each district to perform formal recitation of prayers (otakabe IK) and insect-repelling rites.48 The high priestess and 4 There is an extensive literature on Japan's foreign relations during the Tokugawa period in which Ryukyu figures prominently.

Vestiges of the older tedako ideology also remained. For example, nearly all official monuments retained the solar orb as the central decoration adorning the top portion (see Figure 6). What was the significance of these older symbols and insti- tutions in the "Confucianized" Ryukyu of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries? This question can be answered by examining the case of amagoi ff1 fg', official prayers and rites designed to cause rainfall. Okinawa receives most of its rain during the summer monsoon season. Oc- casionally, the monsoon rains fail to arrive at Okinawa or other Ryukyu islands, and the summer sun causes an evaporation rate of approximately 200 ml/month. The fields dry up, and Okinawa reverts to the same climate as the many other tropical desert areas around the world at about the same latitude.49 The response of the royal government to such droughts was often amagoi. Ryukyukoku yuraiki ,WNdi*Mh`, a record of Ryukyuan cus- toms completed in 1713, provides a brief description of these rites in Shuri: "The rain sacrifice is conducted at this sacred site during times of extreme drought, and the sage above [the king] travels there. At that time, the celebrants are the oamu shirare of the three dis- tricts of Shuri and the Shuri nizigan amu shirare."50 The details of ,0 Figure 6: Decorative images from the top of a monument, 1798 4 Higa, Ko-Ryukyu no shiso, pp. 152-53. 5 Iha, Higashionna, and Yokoyama, eds., Ryuikyu shiryo sosho, vol. 1 (Hobunshokan, 1940, 1988), p. 158.</page><page sequence="31">ROYAL AUTHORITY IN RYUKYU 119 amagoi varied from place to place, and there were at least five major varieties. The basic procedure in rural areas was first for the noro to pray at a local sacred grove. Next, the local inhabitants would dance in an elliptical pattern, while the noro ritually sprinkled water on the dancers. A Kyuyo account of an 1825 amagoi ordered by the central government reads: From the twenty-fifth day of the eighth month to the twenty-seventh day, prayers were offered before the sacred flame in the royal palace and at each of the palace's sacred groves. Thirty-seven officials of various ranks from high to low were led in procession to pray together for rain in the palace courtyard. Also, the high priestess offered prayers before the sacred flame and led the thirty-seven officials in proc- ession to offer prayers together at the shrines in each of Shuri's three districts. Zen monks prayed for rain at Enkakuji by chanting the Dai-hannya kyo; Shingon monks did so at Gokokuji. Then, seventeen officials from Kumemura, led by the Taifu, stayed at the Tenpi temple complex for three days and prayed at the shrines of the Dragon King and Tenson. [listing of each official]. Also, on the first day of the pray- ers for rain, the officials of Naha and Kumemura and their staffs divided into two groups. A high-ranking official led one group to beseech the Dragon King, board- ing a dragon boat from Kumemura, going to Tomigusuku, and praying for rain there. The other group, led by the Council of Three, prayed for rain before the Tenpi temple. Such prayers were also offered at Tomari and in each district for three days. During the amagoi, officials dressed one degree more humbly than usual, and the slaughter of animals was prohibited.51 At this level, high male and female officials, Buddhist monks, and the high officials (taifu 7&amp;k) from Kumemura, Ryukyu's center for Chinese studies, participated in amagoi. The prayers to the Dragon King and other deities of southeast Chinese folk religion was a rela- tively late addition to the mix, dating to the reign of Sho Boku, who was much interested in Chinese popular Daoism. Significantly, the king did not participate in amagoi at this time, although he did order the rites and sometimes presided over them. Prior to the eighteenth century, the king sometimes performed amagoi rites personally, reciting prayers, lifting up holy water, and performing the same rites as the priestesses. In the early eighteenth century, however, direct royal participation in amagoi stopped.52 By the time of the rites described in the Kyu-yo passage above, a wide 5' Kyuiyo, #1633.

The king now stood well above all other Ryukyuans. The high priestess, once nearly the king's equal in importance, had become a technical specialist in the service of the court. It is also important to consider the ideological status of amagoi rites during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It is hard to say whether most Ryukyuan elites had similar views of amagoi, but we can ascertain the view of early modern Ryukyu's most influen- tial politician and Confucian ideologue, Sai On BE (1682-1761). In a passage in Conversations with a Rustic Old Man (C. Suoweng pianyan, J. Sao hengen nAt-), Sai On addressed this practice in a dialogue about ancient Chinese history between a fictitious "old man" and two aristocrats. One of the aristocrats asked why King Tang, founder of the Shang dynasty, prayed for rain: Two members of the aristocracy came to visit the old man. One said, "There is a drought now. Don't we badly need to pray for rain?" The old man said, "Is there a basis in the cosmic pattern (li X-) for such a rite?" The aristocrat said, "Tang was a sage. He prayed for rain in a clearing within a mulberry forest." The old man said, "You know that King Tang prayed for rain, but you do not know his ideas about praying for rain." The aristocrat said, "I beg you to explain this matter." The old man said, "King Tang drove out Jie of the Xia and founded the Shang. The hearts of the people were joyous and they regarded it as a time when a violent ruler had been overthrown and replaced by an enlightened ruler. But unfortunate- ly, after the good omen of Tang's ascendancy, there was a drought for several years. The people secretly harbored doubts and thought that tian (heaven, the cos- mos) was going to replace Tang. At this time, if King Tang had been lacking in moral power (deli iJl), tian would have brought about a change and the people would have been in misery. Therefore, he expeditiously established the practice of praying for rain and offered himself up as a sacrifice. The way he conducted him- self brought him respect, and, from that time on, the whole realm believed in and obeyed him. He became a father and mother to the masses and set their minds at ease. This practice was something Tang devised to stabilize the people's minds and to preserve society. Is there, then, really a basis in the cosmic pattern for praying for rain? If there is, Tang should have prayed for rain when the drought started. Why did he wait until seven years had passed before he prayed for rain?" [The other aristocrat then asks about an instance of the Duke of Zhou praying, and the old man makes the same point.]</page><page sequence="33">ROYAL AUTHORITY IN RYUKYU 121 The two aristocrats understood and said, "Hearing this now is like first awaken- ing from a dream. But we ask, is it possible to do away with such false practices en- tirely? " The old man said, "Such popular customs are appropriate under certain circum- stances. "5 For Sai On, the practice of official prayers for rain was an ex- pedient technique intended to bolster the people's confidence in the moral authority of the ruler. Such prayers have no efficacy in the sense of literally inducing rainfall. This view of official prayer as an expedient device to bolster confi- dence in the state and its ruler was not limited to amagoi rites. For Sai On, all official religious rites were expedient devices, necessary as long as the common people continued to be ignorant of the true principles of the Confucian way. Sai On found this ignorance lamentable, saying that if prayer were indeed efficacious: "Why did Confucius not pray for the sake of Yen Yuan and Bo Wen? Exam- ples such as this are clear and easy to discern. Why is it, then, that in later ages people confuse emptiness (xu *) and substance (shi .), and those who always deal with substantive matters and clearly make this distinction are so very few? This is indeed lamentable."54 Elsewhere in this passage, Sai On describes acts of prayer by high- profile figures as quanfa ft, "expedient techniques." He glosses quanfa with the Buddhist term fangbian jiJ, "skillful means."55 Noteworthy in this passage is the indication that while Sai On consi- dered prayer to be an "empty" practice without metaphysical ba- sis, many other Ryukyuans, elite members of society included, prob- ably did not. Sai On not only regarded rites based mainly on native Ryukyuan religion as expedient devices, but he also relegated Bud- dhism to the status of quanfa.56 After his death, Ryukyuan elites routinely studied Sai On's writ- ings as part of their education. By the end of the eighteenth century, Sai On's Confucianism had become thoroughly institutionalized, in the curriculum of the state university, for example, in the form of an 5 Sakihama Shufmei %M , Sai On zenshu f (Honpo shoseki, 1984), p. 185. 54 Ibid., p. 97. 55 The concept of quan a was central to Sai On's Confucian thought and political practice.

It is likely that by the early nineteenth century many Ryu- kyuan elites regarded amagoi and other official rites in which priestesses played a major role as expedient devices. The continued display of the solar orb on official monuments may also have served the purpose of conveying a sense of the power of the royal court to ordinary Ryukyuans, many of whom would have continued to prac- tice solar worship as part of their religious activities. CONCLUSION The historical development of royal ideology in Ryukyu took place in three phases. The first begins with the reign of Sho Shin in the late fifteenth century and ends with Satsuma's invasion of 1609. Sho Shin and his successor Sho Sei established tedako ideology. Der- ived mainly from native Ryukyuan solar worship, tedako ideology was also shaped by Japanese Shingon Buddhism, including honji- suijaku notions of sovereign as avatar of the solar Buddha, as well as by Chinese examples of the ruler venerating and deriving power from tian, or "heaven," a term that in Ryukyu had close ties with teda, the sun-as-deity. The second phase occurred in the seven- teenth century, during which time the central role of priestesses as empowering agents came under attack. Sho Shoken's separation of the king from direct participation in many religious rites set the stage for the steady displacement of tedako ideology in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the third phase. During the kingdom's final two centuries, Ryukyu's elites initiated large-scale institution- al reforms designed to enhance royal authority and prestige and to portray the king as a Confucian sage, following Chinese models. Some elements of tedako ideology, however, remained evident in royal rites and symbolism even during the late nineteenth century. Furthermore, Ryukyu's female religious officials, although by then clearly subordinate to the male sovereign, continued to serve the state as religious technicians. During times of emergency such as se- vere drought the role of the high priestess and her officials became es- pecially prominent, as the state continued older traditions of per- forming official prayers. A distinctive feature of Ryukyuan history compared with its larger neighbors in East Asia is the high visibil-</page><page sequence="35">ROYAL AUTHORITY IN RYUKYU 123 ity, and, especially before the seventeenth century, the high degree of power of female officials. Although women played important polit- ical and social roles in ancient and prehistoric Japan, Korea, and possibly elsewhere in East Asia, in Ryukyu they did so in an official capacity through the nineteenth century. Still, even in Ryukyu, the status of female officials declined in early modern times, from em- powering agent, on a par with the king to technical specialists in the king's service. In the eyes of Ryukyu's most influential ideologue, Sai On, the activities of the priestesses were merely expedient devices with no substantive grounding in the cosmic order. The same eclectic mix of ideological elements-some native, some coming into the kingdom from China or Japan-remained present in Ryukyu during all three phases. Certain elements became more central and others more peripheral in response to new historical circumstances. Sho Shin attempted to distinguish the king from the aji by employing several interrelated strategies for as- sociating the monarch, and the monarch only, with the power of the sun. Satsuma's invasion and subsequent domination of Ryukyu was the major impetus behind Sho Shoken's attempts to separate the king and priestess as well as the eighteenth-century sinification of royal rites, imagery, and symbolism. All elements, however, retained some degree of viability. In Shot Shin's time, for example, it would have been plausible for Ryukyuans to view the king as a Confucian sage in certain contexts. In the nineteenth century, the decorative carving on official monuments reminded them of the king's links with solar power. Royal authority in the kingdom of Ryukyu was created through an ongoing process of discursive construction.</page></plain_text>
