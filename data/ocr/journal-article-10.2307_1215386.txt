For years students of American material culture have been trying to understand and explain what they do and how they do it. No scholar has been more influential on this score than Jules David Prown, professor emeritus of the history of art at Yale University. Through his teaching and writ- ing, Prown has guided several decades of scholars as they navigated the often strange and unfamil- iar terrain of the material world. In American Arti- facts: Essays in Material Culture, a new collection edited by Prown and his former student Kenneth Haltman, the so-called Prownian method is fur- ther explicated and richly illustrated; two intro- ductory essays by Haltman and Prown are fol- lowed by expanded versions of twelve papers produced initially for Prown's graduate art and artifact course. Central to Prown's method is his insistence that the object-if carefully and properly de- coded-is an essential primary source, capable of revealing unique and important cultural informa- tion. According to Prown, any researcher can, by engaging an object directly through his or her senses, reexperience a historical event: the object itself. This scrutiny of artifacts shifts the epistemo- logical emphasis away from an intellectual en- gagement with words (documents recording the past) to a full sensory experience of the past as it continues into the present. Such an approach promises that "noble dream" of truly objective history. It is an idea that was and continues to be tantalizing, fruitful, and debatable. Twenty years ago, in two Winterthur Portfolio ar- ticles, "Style as Evidence" (1980) and "Mind in Matter: An Introduction to Material Culture, The- ory, and Method" (1982), Prown offered his ideas to the field. (Although summarized, neither article is republished in American Artifacts; readers may wish to return to the originals.) In the first article Prown demonstrates that style, or the man- ner in which something was made, is an impor- tant, often unselfconscious, bearer of culture. "Mind in Matter" sets forth a four-step method that takes the researcher from unbiased observa- tion to deduction, through speculation, and fi- nally reasoned, interpretive analysis. The most im- portant component of the process was keeping the investigator's own cultural predilections at bay while pursuing an honest and untainted en- counter with an artifact. Prown writes: "I would argue that the process of investigation--the se- quence-is critical for the accuracy of material culture analysis, for making it hew as closely to the culture as possible" (p. xii). In his introduction to American Artifacts, Halt- man extensively annotates Prown's detailed as- signment, which will be especially useful for in- structors wishing to try the assignment with undergraduate or graduate students. Each step of the process is explained and elaborated. Haltman enthusiastically endorses Prown's project not only for its intellectual validity but also for the way it empowers students: they confront historical data directly, enjoy its drama and materiality, and learn to trust their own judgements. Prown and Haltman both stress the nature of this project as an essay, an experiment meant to stimulate rigor- Permission to reprint a book review in this section may be obtained only from the author.</page><page sequence="2">246 Winterthur Portfolio 36:4 ous and creative thought while perhaps finally leading only to further questions. The ultimate objective of Prown's assignment is not to discover the object's maker, construc- tion, or overt purpose (although all are relevant), but to discover "mind-belief-the belief of in- dividuals and the belief of groups, of individuals, of societies . . . what lies behind surface appear- ance, behind the mask." In fact, Prown states, "artifacts may reveal deeper cultural truth if in- terpreted as fictions rather than as history." These fictions most often appear as "simile, me- tonymy, synecdoche, metaphor" (p. 13). Artifacts are historical facts, but they may be much more revealing of a culture's deepest and most signifi- cant beliefs when understood as fictions. And some objects are more forthcoming than others. Prown encouraged his students to be creative in their choice of object, although he retained veto power. When considering what made him favor a given selection, he concluded: "It seems to de- pend on a linkage-formal, iconographic, func- tional-between the object and some fundamen- tal human experience" (p. 2). In other words, Prown himself had to believe the object carried significant cultural meaning. A legendary example of this exercise is Prown's treatment of an eighteenth-century metal teapot. What can the form and style of a teapot reveal of a culture's "fictions"? For an an- swer, one must temporarily disregard what one knows about international trade and tea parties of one fashion or another. One must engage the teapot on a more visceral, emotive level, looking at shapes and solids and voids, searching for met- aphor. As Prown led groups of curious students through this process, the final conclusion-al- ways-was that the teapot resembled a woman's breast, evoking primal, soothing associations of maternal nurture and warmth as well as cheer- fulness and sociability. The student essays in American Artifacts are proof of the extraordinary value of Prown's method. They represent a wide variety of objects: empire cellarette, candlestick telephone, Amish quilt, cigarette lighter, Haitian money box, cor- set, parlor stove, lava lamp, iron footbridge, locket, food mill, and argand lamp. Each essay is engaging and readable and will be valuable to those interested in the specific category of object or historical period. The enthusiasm and obvious enjoyment of the writers is striking. Several com- ment on the near obsession they fell into while staring at, studying, and even dreaming about their objects while coaxing them to "speak." And speak they do. As these essays show, scholarship about objects can rise to the challenges of the new narrative history. Even though they base their work on inanimate objects, these writers tell terrific stories. Recalling Prown's exercise with the teapot, it is not surprising that students often find meta- phors of the body in inanimate objects. An argand lamp, for example, "produces light through an infusion of whale oil (sperm oil) from a masculine reservoir into a feminine globe in which combustion occurs" (p. 246). A candle- stick telephone is even more completely an- thropomorphic-"the transmitter as mouth or eye (both synechdoches for head), the yoke as neck, the switchhook as uplifted arm, the shaft as torso, the receiver as both hand and ear, the dial as genitals and phonecord aperture as anus, set into the belly of the base" (p. 75).Jokes (respect- ful) about the Prown method often turn on this matter of bodily analogies. Yet as the diversity and complexity of these essays reveal, that is just one component of a full and detailed analysis. In his treatment of the telephone, for example, Halt- man plays the anthropomorphic to the hilt, but he works it to great advantage in his excellent reading of the object. When talking on the tele- phone, discourse became less personal-"con- versation sold as commodities" (p. 79)-and the phone set took the place of the person on the other end of the line. The potential for artifacts to reveal surprising and complex revelations is illustrated in Daisann McLane's essay on the Haitian money box, or bwat sekre. This small, shimmering artifact leads the author directly into the middle of a dense global economy. Made by Haitians and offered for sale in the Port au Prince market, such boxes are commonly used by market women to secure their money. McLane's box was made of old American scrap metal imprinted with the slogans ("Time Saving, Money Saving, Labor Saving") and designs (bold red and blue circles) of Nevr- Dull polish, manufactured by a New York com- pany. McLane discovered that this sheet metal was originally printed for jar or can lids of an older Nevr-Dull packaging design not produced since 1983. She thus concluded that "the materi- als for my secret box had been sitting around in warehouses or in container ships for more than ten years" (p. 125). When the Haitian craftsman discovered and used the metal, McLane specu- lates, the shapes and colors took on new mean-</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 247 ings. Because most Haitians do not read English, the logos were likely incomprehensible. The col- ors and patterns, however, resonated with Haitian political symbols and vodou sign systems. Two other essays deserve specific mention for their brilliant analysis and graceful presentation. Anyone questioning the validity of Prown's method would do well to visit Carlo Rotella's dis- cussion of an iron footbridge in New Haven's East Rock Park. Rotella combines the richness of the "bridging" metaphor with a consideration of the complex interplay of nature and industry. "The principle of the inspirational park and the litera- ture of bridge epiphanies imagine a flow of mean- ing between individual and environment. They share the assumption that one's identity does not necessarily stop at the borders of the body but in- stead extends to landscapes and objects charged with personal and communal meaning. Visitors to a bridge invest it with significance . . . as they en- list the bridge in the project of sustaining and re- vising identities" (p. 204). Rotella's essay ex- plores the value of Prown's method in the realm of environmental history and the history of tech- nology. Prown himself confesses that, although he was initially skeptical of the analytical possibili- ties of what he called "devices," over the years many of the richest and most fruitful projects have dealt with just such objects. Of course, devices can be art, too. As Rotella notes: "Like any bridge, the footbridge is both a piece of sculpture and a roadway across an obsta- cle. The sculpture, offering aesthetic transport, encourages the eye and mind to linger above the stream of events in a suspended moment; the roadway, enabling physical transportation, offers a way to get to the other side. The two imperatives condition and complement one another." In fact, "exploration of the footbridge's form and history tends to collapse together ostensibly anti- thetical terms-park and city, nature and indus- try, self and environment, past and present. Even as an object of analysis, the bridge serves its tradi- tional function: it allows us to distinguish each term from its opposite, like two banks of a river, but it gives us a way to understand the pair to- gether as a single larger terrain" (p. 191). Rotella shows us how Prown's project can encourage the best sort of interdisciplinary thinking and writing. Rigorously pursued, such object investigation can lead outward in apparently limitless directions. Jennifer Roberts's discussion, "Lucubrations on a Lava Lamp: Technocracy, Counterculture, and Containment in the American Sixties," is an- other stunning display of talent and imagination. Roberts offers us a surprising look at an appeal- ing, well-known object made continuously from 1965 to the present. She contends that rather than simply a manifestation of hippie weirdness, the lamp's commercial and cultural success "de- rived from its singular ability to arbitrate between the psychedelic counterculture and its nominally antithetical 'establishment' " (p. 169). The lamp "embodied both IBM and LSD; both housewife and hippie; both Bomb and be-in. And thus the lamp can illuminate for us a different sixties ... in which the distinctions between culture and counterculture were far more fluid than we have come to believe" (pp. 168-69). Countless middle-class suburbanites purchased and enjoyed lava lamps. How can this be? Ranging through cultural sources such as Timothy Leary's Psyche- delic Experience and the 1966 film Fantastic Voyage, Roberts always maintains a close connection with the object itself and its captivating, shifting form. She writes: "The glass tank of the lava lamp occu- pies much the same position as the glass sheet covering a painting of a lava-spewing volcano. Yet here the plane of glass has imploded, enfolded, around a pressurized core or chunk of sublimity. In the painted sublime, the threat remains out- side. But the contained or imploded sublime deals with a fear that has come inside, threaten- ing from any angle because the viewer's space sur- rounds it entirely. This is the domestic sublime, managed by vessels instead of shields" (p. 183). (One is reminded of Elaine Tyler May's discus- sion of the Cold War family and a domestic ver- sion of containment.) The essays discussed here represent only a small portion of the literally hundreds of papers written in response to the assignment. Because the class itself was so much a part of the experi- ence, I indulge in a few memories of my own par- ticipation in the spring of 199o. Although stu- dents strove to maintain scholarly distance, without doubt this experience was an extraordi- narily social and personal one. Each week as we confronted an object-ranging from the infa- mous teapot to a Winslow Homer painting (Morn- ing Bells) to a building (Louis Kahn's Yale Center for British Art) to one unlucky student's attire- we were asked to respond over and over again from our gut. While certainly not unmediated by the professor, the conversation was unusually frank. For their projects, my classmates chose such objects as a refrigerator, a silhouette, a pair of gloves, and an inflatable playmate (imagine</page><page sequence="4">248 Winterthur Portfolio 36:4 passing "Baby Love Doll" around the seminar ta- ble). In a shocking finale to the course, one stu- dent rose following her final presentation (about a transvestite's shoe) and read a prepared state- ment accusing her classmates of ignoring the con- tributions and perspectives of African Americans throughout the semester. She then immediately exited the room, leaving us in stunned silence. Professor Prown, being a masterful teacher, han- dled the situation with grace and courage, and all were quick to admit the validity of the criticisms. This occurrence was extraordinary. As far as I know, nothing like it happened before or since. But it is a story worth relating because it high- lights two important points. First, when objects are evidence, particularly in the employ of a method such as Prown's, they often break down scholarly distance, and discussion can become highly personal. Second, the story brings us back to the objectivity/subjectivity question at the core of most challenges to Prown's method. With one important exception, the students in my seminar thought we were assessing artifacts fairly and thor- oughly. But were we? In 1989 Prown presented the opening paper at the Smithsonian conference "History from Things: The Use of Objects in Understanding the Past." The papers from this interdisciplinary and cross-cultural gathering were published in 1993 in a collection of the same title. Prown's paper (essentially the same as his introductory essay to American Artifacts) drew energetic discussion. As John Dixon Hunt relates in his final essay in the volume, "The Sign of the Object," the question is: "Can we ... step outside our own cultural giv- ens, our own time and place, and 'interpret the evidence of another culture objectively?'" (p. 295). Can artifacts be more objectively under- stood than other historical sources? Scholars from a variety of disciplines use objects for a wide range of purposes. Object study is limited, Hunt concludes, by the researcher's intellectual and cultural (and perhaps even sensory) biases as well as the limits of language. Because each artifact embodies a range of meanings, it is unlikely that any one researcher will plumb its depths, and im- portant perspectives may be omitted. Finally, Hunt argues: "We cannot dissociate ourselves from what we bring to the study of objects, we should not try to engage them in a minimalist way" (p. 295).1 Hunt's comments are typical of criticisms di- rected at the Prownian method. Yet, as American Artifacts demonstrates, Prown's method is undeni- ably successful. It has resonated with several gen- erations of curators and scholars of many disci- plines drawn to the interpretive power of objects. The potential of artifact study has also attracted interest from those who, in a postmodern mood, have questioned the historical "truthfulness" of more traditional, documentary sources. The essays in American Artifacts display vigor- ous and creative historical research to augment intensely focused object study. Something impor- tant happens when the researcher strives to ap- proach the artifact as objectively as possible and discovers its metaphoric content, or "fictions." Prown's invaluable contribution, as teacher and scholar, has been to show us how to begin not only to understand objects on their own terms but also to write the kind of delightful, fresh, and insightful history that these essays exemplify.
