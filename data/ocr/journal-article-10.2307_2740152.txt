<plain_text><page sequence="1">Urbanization and Social Change in Africa1 by A. L. Epstein THE ACHIEVEMENT of political independence in s( many African countries and their emergence intc nationhood are spectacular and dramatic expression of the great contemporary upheaval of societ) throughout the continent. While from some points o: view these developments might seem to have beer extremely rapid, they have not, however, occurrec overnight. They are rather the end-product of very complex economic, social, and political processes thai have been at work over many years. Among the many factors contributing to these developments has beer the growth of large modern towns and cities, in them- selves both a striking index of change and a stimulus to further change. The importance of the towns in social change has not gone unobserved amongst students of African affairs. Thus Hodgkin, a political scientist, has com- mented (1956:18) that "it is above all in these new urban societies that the characteristic institutions and ideas of African nationalism are born and grow to maturity." Hodgkin remarked the parallels between urban growth in Africa today and that in England in the early phases of the Industrial Revolution. Gluck- man (1960:56-57), from a more specifically anthro- pological point of view, has written in somewhat similar terms: ... modern industrial towns have everywhere produced specific types of associations arising from the needs of A. L. EPSTEIN is Professorial Fellow in Social Anthropology at the Australian National University, Canberra. Previously, he was Senior Lecturer in the Department of Social Anthropology and Sociology, University of Manchester. He carried out field- work in Northern Rhodesia (Zaambia) in 1950-56, for most of this time as a Research Officer of the iRhodes Livingstone In- stitute, Lusaka. More recently (1960-61) he has worked among the Tolai people of the Gazelle Peninsula, New Britain. Apart from his work in the field of urbanization in Africa, Epstein has written on various aspects of primitive law. Current- ly he is engaged in a study of social and political organization in Melanesia. The present paper, submitted 14 v 66, was sent for CA* treatment to 34 scholars, of whom the following responded with written comments: Edward M. Bruner, Peter C. W. Gut- kind, Michael M. Horowitz, Kenneth L. Little, Daniel F. McCall, Philip Mayer, Horace Miner, Leonard Plotnicov, W. B. Schwab; and William A. Shack. Their comments are printed in full after the author's text and are followed by a reply from the author. urban life. . . . We must expect these associations inevitably to develop in Africa. ... An African townsman is a towns- man, an African miner is a miner. Most of the detailed studies of urbanization and urbanism in Africa to date have been made by social anthropologists. Gluckman's aphorism was in fact the developed expression of a point of view he first advocated in his SEVEN YEAR RESEARCH PLAN of the RHODES-LIVINGSTONE INSTITUTE (1945). The stand- point he adopted there provided an invaluable cor- rective to earlier studies which tended to assess urban phenomena against a rural-tribal model, and it heavily influenced the work of a number of younger scholars in the field, including myself. Such ap- proaches as those of Hodgkin and Gluckman marked a big advance in thinking about tnese problems by their emphasis on the positive features and functions of urban life. Yet, as our knowledge of African urbanism accumulates, it also becomes clear that such formulations may do less than justice to the complexity of the phenomena, and can lead to an obscuring of certain important problems calling for analysis. Thus, for example, the connection which Hodgkin postulates between the growth of towns and the rise of African nationalism seems, on the face of it, straightforward and indisputable. On the other hand, we must face the fact that the countries of tropical Africa where nationalism has been most advanced have sometimes had very small proportionate numbers engaged in wage labour, surely a primary mark of modern urban life. Clearly, urbanization in modern Africa has gone hand in hand with a number of other processes-industrialization, Westernization, the growth of settler communities, etc.-all of which have to be kept analytically distinct if we are to make valid generalizations. Consideration of Gluckman's position also points up the increasing need for sharper and more varied I This article is based upon a paper originally prepared for a seminar on political development organized by the Centre for Development Studies, University of Manchester, in September, 1965. My thanks are due to Valdo Pons, with whom I had many discussions in the course of its preparation, and to Peter Worsley, whose enthusiasm for the topic finally persuaded me to undertake the task of writing it. I am also grateful for many comments made at the seminar itself. However, for the final form that the paper takes T nlanne amr&lt;n nclf Vol. 8 . No. 4 .

Thus if, as he has argued, every African is "detribalized" as soon as he leaves his tribal area to come to town, what meaning is to be given to the term "urbanization" itself, and how can we decide whether one African or one population is more "urbanized" than another? It is of course true, as Gluckman remarks, that the man who comes to.town finds himself involved in different kinds of grouping from those which obtained in the village; he also earns his livelihood in a different way and comes under different authorities. But none of this can tell us anything of what Mitchell and Shaul (1963) have called "the degree of commitment to urban residence," still less of the connection between urban commitment and the development of new patterns of behavior and sets of values and attitudes. For example, discussing the role of the African urban courts in towns on the Copperbelt of Northern Rhodesia (Zambia), I have drawn attention to an inconsistency in the attitudes of Africans towards these bodies (Epstein 1953a, 1953b). This assessment was based on evidence of a wholly qualitative order. In a later study of power and prestige among urban Africans, the use of quan- titative methods threw further light on the position of the court members within the urban community (Mitchell and Epstein 1957). The respondents in this experiment were divided into three categories in terms of the number of years they had resided in town: (1) under two years; (2) between three and seven years; and (3) eight years and over. The data showed that the court members were ranked higher by respondents in the second category than by those in the first or the third. In short, what Mayer (1962) has called Gluckman's alternation model disregards the very process of becoming a townsman; it does not take sufficient account of the fact that urbanization, in at least one of its dimensions, involves a process of growth and change. A further difficulty of Gluckman's formulation is that while it correctly invites us to set our studies of African urbanization in the context of studies of urban life elsewhere, it does not enable us to handle so readily the problem of variation in urban social systems. As studies of modern urban Africa accumu- late, it becomes increasingly plain that the patterns of migration and urban growth are far from uniform throughout the continent: in particular, there appear to be a number of important respects in which the West African situation differs markedly from that obtaining in South and Central Africa (see, e.g., Banton 1966). While it is possible to detect certain general patterns in African urbanization, the deeper under- standing of this phenomenon and its role in social change requires not only that we pay closer attention to the problem of variation, but that this diversity be handled within a single conceptual framework. What, then, are we to understand by urbanization? In an immediate sense, it refers, of course, to living in towns as against living in rural settlements, and it is on this basis that simple, quantitative indices of urbanization are sometimes constructed: for example, the proportion of a population resident in towns of a given population size at a given moment. Such indices are useful for certain limited purposes, for example, as a measure of demographic change, but in other helpful, particularly in the African context. What, for instance, is to be made of a measure which is based on the number of cities with a population of 100,000 or more and gives Nigeria an index of urbanization of 4.3, whereas Zambia, whose Copperbelt constitutes a large, modern industrial and urban complex, does not even register (see Appendix in Almond and Coleman 1960)? There are parts of Nigeria where Africans have lived traditionally in large, densely populated settle- ments, but where the contemporary drift to the towns has been relatively slight. A number of Yoruba towns, for example, have populations in excess of 100,000 but between 1921 and 1952 Yoruba country had the lowest rate of urban growth in Nigeria, and the popu- lation of these cities remained fairly homogeneous (Coleman 1958:75). In Zambia, by contrast, during this same period, about 250,000 Africans, from every part of the country and beyond, came to live and work in the towns of the Copperbelt. It seems more meaningful to me therefore to regard urbanization as -involving a process of movement and change; its essence is that it creates the possibility of discontinuity with some pre-existing set of conditions. This may be contrasted with urbanism, which is the way of life in the towns themselves. In this way it may be possible to speak, for example, of Yoruba urbanism without necessarily implying Yoruba urbanization, though it is clear that this process too is now occurring on an increasing scale (Schwab 1966). It follows also that urbanization cannot be treated as a uni-dimensional phenomenon: it has demographic, social structural, and cultural aspects, each of which poses separate analytical problems, but which also have to be studied in their inter-relations. There are now available studies of a fair number of African towns and cities, so that some attempt at synthesis may be useful at this stage, even though there are still vast lacunae in our know- ledge. The main emphasis here, however, will be on the structural aspects of urbanization: in what follows, therefore, I have set out to examine some of the variables that shape the structure of social relations in modern African towns. And since towns are not self-contained social entities, but have their place with- in a wider field of social relationships, I shall also discuss the relations of these towns to other towns and to the rural areas, and consider briefly the role of the towns within the developing nation. THE DETERMINANTS OF URBAN SOCIAL STRUCTURE Many writers nowadays remind us that towns were known in Africa long before the onset of the modern period, particularly in West, and parts of Central, Africa. Many of the famous urban centres of the past have declined, however, and those that have remained important have done so only by undergoing a trans- formation. The towns with which we are chiefly con- cerned, then, are new, and in most cases have seen their most rapid growth in the decade or two following the Second World War. During this period the popu- lation of many centres more than doubled. Unlike the traditional towns and cities, these new centres are the product of colonialism: as Dresch (quoted in Balandier 1956:497) puts it, "cthey are towns built by whites and 276 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="3">Epstein: URBANIZATION ANY) SOCIAL. CHT-ANGE TN APRICA occupied by blacks." This factor alone has been of great importance in stamping the towns with a number of general characteristics: great racial and ethnic di- versity, accompanied by wide differences between the groups in economic and social status, technical skills, and way of life. In general terms, the dichotomy of rich and poor has correlated closely with that of white and black, between whom a third "colour group" of Asiatics or Levantines frequently intervenes. These contrasts and divisions within the community are at once reflected in the physical lay-out of the town. The physical separation of the races and of ethnic groups finds its most rigid expression in the principle of apartheid in the Union of South Africa, but the tendency for African urban-dwellers to be housed on their own separate estates was almost uni- versal in pre-independence days. Thus as Pons (1965) has recorded of Stanleyville: The physical lay-out of the town could be seen as both an expression and a symbol of the relations between Africans and Europeans. European residential areas were situated close to, and tended to run into, the area of administrative offices, hotels, shops and other service establishments, while African residential areas were strictly demarcated and well removed from the town centre. Pons notes too how the location of the African areas contributed to their "suburban" or dormitory charac- ter: from early morning until the night curfew which prohibited African entry to the "European town" and European entry to the African areas, there was a large volume of movement between the two. The African area (centre extra-coutumier or "municipal location") has indeed some affinities with a suburb, or more often perhaps with a slum in, say, a Western city, but its legal status is quite different. Moreover, the effect of social convention and administration has been to set a barrier rou-nd the location and thus effectively to exclude the residents from full participation in the life of the town and the enjoyment of its amenities. Africans in what is now Zambia used to sum it up succinctly: tarred roads always stop at the entrance to the location. In the countries of West Africa, physical segregation was not built into the legal code, but the social pattern has often been broadly similar. In some cases, indeed, the town includes a number of areas which belong to different ethnic or tribal com- munities. Thus in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, the Vai, the Kru, and the Bassa each corporately owns and administers its own area (Fraenkel 1964:52). The impact of the colonial regime on the physical structure of the town is to be seen in other ways. Of Tanzania's capital, Dar-es-Salaam, for example, it has been remarked that an air of Bavaria still dominates much of its architecture (Bates 1962:401); while a comparison of Elizabethville with the Copperbelt towns of Zambia will leave no doubts about the national origins of the architects of each. However, the "colonial experience" itself has not been uniform, and other variables which touch more immediately the process of urbanization and the system of social re- lations that build up within the town need to be brought into the analysis. Three factors in particular appear to merit attention: (1) the "industrial struc- which the town seeks to achieve those economic aims and purposes that brought it into existence, or give it its present importance; (2) the "civic structure," which derives from the policies and practices of its administration; and (3) the "demographic imperative" (Mitchell 1959), which affects in a variety of ways the social composition of the town and the degree of urban commitment. As I noted earlier, all the indications in the avail- able literature point to important differences between the patterns of West African urbanization and those encountered further to the south. There are a number of reasons for this, but a major one clearly relates to differences in "industrial structure." The wealth of many of the West African countries has been based on various cash crops: palm-oil, cocoa, or ground nuts. Hence, as Hodgkin has remarked (1956:78) many of the larger towns have been relatively feeble as centres of production and have developed rather as centres of import and export and, increasingly, of administra- tion. This, I suggest, immediately gives them a char- acter that contrasts sharply with that of more purely industrial towns. In my own work on the Copperbelt, I have drawn attention to the different ways in which urban associations and the patterns of political lead- ership develop in a mine township as compared with a municipality (Epstein 1958, 1961). The company town, built up around the mine, tends to develop a markedly paternalistic regime providing for and con- trolling most aspects of the social life of the workers and their families. By contrast, the commercial town- ship, with its hundreds of small firms offering many different forms of employment, is much more diver- sified in its structure, and its people tend to develop a more independent outlook. Interesting confirmation of this view is to be found in Powdermaker's study (1962) of the impact of mass-communications on Afri- cans in Luanshya, where she was able to show that Africans in the municipal location there bought many more magazines and newspapers and read much more widely than their fellows on the mine. On this argu- ment, it is therefore in the ports and great commercial centres rather than around the mines that variegated interest groups may be expected to emerge and political associations and trade unions to develop and flourish. Certainly this was the case with the Industrial and Commercial Workers Union, one of the first great experiments in African trade unionism: the I.C.U. had its beginning in 1920 among the African dock-workers of Cape Town, then spread to the sea-ports of Port Elizabeth and East London, and only in 1925 moved its headquarters to Johannesburg (Roux 1948). The growth on the Copperbelt of the African Mine-Wor- kers Union, perhaps the most successful example of African unionism on the continent, might appear to controvert this argument. However, the A.M.W.T.U. developed in particularly favourable circumstances, and the mine-workers were among the last African workers in what was then Northern Rhodesia to be organized in a union. The mine-workers indeed tended to be held in rather low esteem within the wider African urban community and, it was said, were com- monly regarded by the shop-assistants and others as being too "primitive" ever to comprehend the prin- Vol. 8.

It is not enough, then to regard modern urban centres in Africa simply as towns: if we are to understand the systems of social relations developing within them and their implications for social or political change, we have to think of them too in terms of industrial structure-as administrative centres, as market-places, as sea-ports or railway junctions, and as centres of production, or as various combinations of these. Towns differ not only in the patterns of their economic activities, but also in the institutions and practices through which they are governed. These may relate in some measure to those factors just previously considered, but they are also affected by broader ad- ministrative policy, for example the idea of stabiliza- tion of the urban population. Thus stabilization was the policy favoured in the Belgian Congo, and its result was the development of the centre extra-coutumier, a self-contained residential and administrative unit un- der the close supervision of a European administrative officer, within which Africans could establish a stable family life in their own homes. The situation that obtained in Stanleyville, where a team of investigators found they had a convenient sampling frame available because all dwelling compounds were officially re- corded by number (Pons 1956:244), contrasts sharply with that in Lagos, where the fieldworker's task was more difficult, partly because the records were inade- quate, partly because the household itself was so puz- zling to define. Marris notes (1961:vii) that people who shared the same room might be unrelated and live entirely independent lives; on the other hand, a wife might live several streets away from her husband, though she would cook for him every day and depend upon him for support. Such differences of policy and practice in regard to the housing of African urban-dwellers are usually the expression of basic differences in the approach to urban administration. Other such differences appear in policy in regard to the acquisition of land rights within the township area; in the presence or absence of measures for "influx control"; in the different forms of machinery of urban local government; and in the extent to which Africans participate in civic affairs or in the administration of justice. An interest- ing illustration of the latter point is to be found in the part played by "tribal" authorities in urban admin- istration in different places. In some cases, for ex- ample, the system of local administration has been built up around the principle of tribal representation. In Freetown, Sierra Leone, tribal headmen were offi- cially recognised and played an important part in maintaining law and order (Banton 1957), while on the Copperbelt tribal elders fulfilled similar functions. Moreover, on the Copperbelt and in other towns of Northern Rhodesia, as well as in the centres iextra- coutumiers of the Belgian Congo, African urban courts had been established by Government where disputes (mainly matrimonial) involving Africans could be settled in accordance with African customary law. By contrast, in Dar-es-Salaam there was no urban court, and the magistrates' courts interfered in such matters hardly at all (Leslie 1963:220). It is interesting to note, however, that what Leslie calls tribal associations seem to have developed spontaneously in Dar-es- Salaam at quite an early date. Leaders of these associ- ations became the acknowledged spokesmen of their people before the German government, and they ap- pear to have fulfilled many of the functions described for tribal headmen in Freetown and tribal elders on the Copperbelt. In West Africa, so far as I am aware, there were no such urban courts, and, Sierra Leone apart, nothing corresponding to the position of tribal elder within the formal administrative framework. On the other hand, there are frequent references in the West African literature to the existence of large numbers of tribal associations of varying types and degrees of importance (Little 1965), a feature of Afri- can urban social life that has been only of marginal significance on the Copperbelt. It seems reasonable to assume therefore that the form of associational life that develops within the towns is closely connected with their civic structure. The approach to urban phenomena illustrated above also provides a means of ordering within a single framework the material accumulated in numerous studies of urbanization and urbanism in Africa. For example, if the forms of local administration are an important source of variation between towns, then we can classify the towns of Africa by the positions they occupy along a continuum defined in terms of civic structure. At one end of such a scale would be the towns and cities of the Union of South Africa, where the civic structure is marked by segregated housing areas and a tightly administered policy of influx control. At the other end would be the situation of relative laissez-faire that seems charateristic of West Africa. The towns and cities of West Africa have never been the "place of the white man" in the same way as Cape Town or Johannesburg or the urban centres of the Rhodesias. They have commonly grown up around the sites of long-established indigenous settlements, and many features of the old towns have been incorporated in the new (Lloyd 1959). Often, indeed, they are syntheses of villages in which each village, though absorbed in the growing town, has preserved its identity (Hodgkin 1956:72). Clearly such centres have a much more organic character than those in which African town-dwellers are required to live in municipal locations or mine compounds. It follows that in the West African countries there has been a much less rigid approach to matters of urban administration: not only is there less direct control over housing and housing conditions, but there is not that same insistence on maintaining public standards of hygiene and sanitation that is one of the hall- marks of the settler-dominated city to the south. In Lagos, we are told, the visitor who explores the im- mediate environs of the large department stores and office blocks must still pick his way amongst rams and chickens rummaging among the garbage, as he seeks a dry foothold beside the open drains (Marris 1961: vii): in Johannesburg the down-town slum yards like Rooiyard (Hellmann 1948) were systematically de- molished long ago and their populations removed to considerable distances from the city centre. Between these two extremes was the former Belgian Congo. There, as we have seen, theoreticallyc"tight" urban administration went hand in hand with a policy of urban stabilization. Within the centres extraz-coutu- miers Africans were encouraged to establish their own homes and were granted loans to acquire a plot of 278 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="5">Epstein: URBANIZATION AND SOCIAL CHANGE IN AFRICA land and build on it. This had a number of important implications; for while on the one hand the organiza- tion and control of the centre suggests many parallels with the locations of Central and South Africa, its residents enjoyed in certain respects an area of choice unknown in the locations. On his plot a man could gather around him a small body of kin and so create a unit somewhat similar to that of the traditional village. In this respect Congo urban patterns of resi- dence seem a little closer to those of certain West African towns than to those of southern Africa. A further point is that the Congolese were also permitted to use their plots as business premises. Many estab- lished small shops (see, e.g., Pons 1961). While this did not produce a new bourgeoisie on the West African model, it did mean that men who were no longer able or willing to seek wage employment (and also divorced women and elderly widows) were able to support themselves in the town and did not have to return to the village as in South Africa or Zambia. African towns may also be classified from the standpoint of their "industrial structure," and here again we find the same broad geographical pattern of contrasts. As noted, the wealth of West Africa has been built up around the export of cash crops. The economy remained essentially land-based, but wealthy Africans frequently built themselves town-houses and increas- ingly sent their children to be educated overseas. Moreover, European personnel was often unobtainable, and the commercial firms had to offer posts to Afri- cans which elsewhere would have been reserved for Europeans. The road was thus opened up for the earlier emergence of a better-educated and more nu- merous class of African businessmen, lawyers, and junior officials. By contrast, in the centres of South Africa and Zambia, built around extractive industries, the African urban population has been made up pre- dominantly of manual workers, and a commercial or professional class has been both numerically and politically insignificant. A classification of towns in terms of industrial structure does not coincide completely with that based on civic structure; at a number of points, the industrial classification appears to cut across the other, which was mainly an expression of the settler/non-settler cleavage. For example, it is my impression that in (Southern) Rhodesia, whose main cities have been manufacturing rather than marketing centres, more scope has been allowed to African business enterprise. A number of Africans in Salisbury and Bulawayo have emerged as wealthy businessmen and store-keepers. Many of these seem to have been associated with the African nationalist movement, but it may not be with- out significance that African merchants in Rhodesia have been noticeably more "accommodationist" (Cole- man 1960:273), and the nationalist movement itself, at least until quite recently, less militant than elsewhere. Secondly, a number of important mining centres have developed in West Africa, and it would be interesting to learn whether they have more in common with, for example, the towns of the Copperbelt than with other towns within the West African region. A study of one of these townships, for instance of Enugu in Nigeria, would be of great interest. In particular, it might tell us a great deal more about the development and role of trade unions in these countries, whose leaders now stress the changed character of trade unionism under independence (Friedland 1964). Southall (1961:6) has distinguished two types of town: type A, the old, established, slowly growing town, found mostly in West Africa, Tanganyika (Tan- zania), and Uganda; and type B, the new town of mushroom growth, primarily found in the Union of South Africa, the Rhodesias, Kenya, and the Belgian Congo. Examination of the data from the standpoints of industrial and civic structure leads to a refinement of Southall's categories; it counteracts any tendency to view urbanization too simplistically, for example in terms of broad contrasts between geographical re- gions; and it raises issues for further inquiry. The third factor which needs to be considered here is the demographic. Many observers have drawn at- tention to the imbalances which occur when rural people seek work in towns. Typically, the structure of the urban population is marked by an excess of men over women and an over-all predominance of people aged 20-40. These factors relate to the patterns of migrancy and to the continuing relations between the town and the areas from which it draws its supply of labour: all have profound implications for the system of social relations developing within the town. The drift to the towns is the universal concomitant of early industrialization, but the way in which it occurs is not everywhere the same. In 19th-century England, for example, the expansion of the industrial towns was achieved by the flow of labour into them from the smaller rural towns in their imme- diate hinterland. In Africa a few instances of progressive migration have been reported (e.g., Doucy and Feldheim 1956), but in the main ur- banization has proceeded, not by a series of stages, but by a sharp leap from small village to distant urban centre, from kisendji, the ancient way of life of the tribe, to kizungu, the "civilized" way of life of the towns (Pons 1956:250). But if in Africa the transition to the town has been somewhat sharper, paradoxically, the break with the village has been less radical. The new African urban labourer remained bound by social, political, and even religious ties to his kinsmen in the rural areas so that, as Mitchell observes (1961:232), it is the circulation of labour rather than its migration which has become its characteristic feature. In this context physical distance becomes a factor of consid- erable importance, the response to urban living amongst different groups being related, at least in part, to the ease with which they can return to their rural homes. So in the East African sea-port of Dar- es-Salaam, whose main sources of labour are not too remote, the agricultural seasons still have immediacy, since "indebtedness is relieved for many by a capital ;um accruing from the rice harvest in June/July, main- y from fields in their home districts" (Leslie 1963:7). 3imilarly, the fact that East London in South Africa is able to meet most of its labour requirements from -he reserves of the Ciskei and Transkei, which lie on ts very door-step, accounts for the relative tribal and inguistic homogeneity of its African population Reader 1961). More important, the ease with which arge numbers of East London labourers are able - t - - - -_ I 2 S _2&lt;_S_ Vol. 8 . No. 4 . October 1967 279</page><page sequence="6">at week-ends puts the Xhosa migrant in a very different position from that, say, of the "Blantyre" in Johannesburg, who, some thousands of miles from his home in Malawi, is necessarily less amenable to the pressures of incapsulation. Indeed, even within East London itself, the factor of distance may have some relevance to the cleavage of "Red" and "School" migrants described by Mayer (1961), for it is the districts which immediately surround the city which are predominantly "Red," while the ma- jority of "School" Xhosa come from further afield. It is not simply a matter of distance, however; there is also the question of the situation of the home area, giving rise to what Leslie has called "the community of the route." Leslie describes how, when Dar-es- Salaam was a very small town, and most of the im- migrants came by foot, the earliest entrants naturally set down their loads at the first opportunity, on the side of town nearest to the direction of their coming. As others followed them, and went to the address of those already there, and then "hived off" and built themselves houses nearby, there was a perceptible polarization of tribes, each group tending to inhabit the quarter nearest its place of origin. Though increas- ingly blurred as the town grew, the original pattern of geographical groups survived and is still perceptible even today. Similar processes have been at work on the towns of the Copperbelt (Mitchell 1953) and elsewhere. Pons (1965), for example, has noted how in Stanleyville the physical distribution of different tribal groups around the- different areas of entry to the town offsets the implications of the high degree of heterogeneity in the population at large and empha- sizes the significance of each township as a distinctive locality of fellow-tribesmen. With time and the in- creasing flow of people to the town, the populations of these localities become ethnically more mixed, but their character, deriving from the pattern of original settlement, is never wholly obscured. Such grouping emphasizes too the very different patterns of incor- poration of various tribes into the life of the town and widely differing sets of urban-rural relations. THE SOCIAL STRUCTURE OF THE TOWN Wirth (1938) has offered a sociological definition of the city as a relatively large, dense, and permanent settlement of heterogeneous individuals, and from these postulates has sought to deduce its major iden- tifying characteristics. Urban social relations are dom- inated, on this view, by the cash nexus and the labour market, and the contacts of the city tend to be im- personal, superficial, transitory, and segmental. Di- versification allows for a greater degree of variability in personal behaviour, and, as primary groupings decline in significance, there is a corresponding em- phasis on formal procedures of social control and on the development of associations. The towns of modern Africa with which we are mainly concerned satisfy the criteria of Wirth's definition of the city, and there is much in his analysis which has an immediate rele- vance to African urbanism. Indeed, many of those who have written of the African towns in terms of their poverty, the break-down of family life, the rise of prostitution, juvenile delinquency, and crime, and the problems of psychic maladjustment are describing phenomena that are fully accounted for in Wirth's theory. All of these are undoubtedly facts of the Afri- can urban situation, no less than they were of Chicago when studied by Wirth and his colleagues in the 1920's, or of Manchester nearly a century earlier, which presented itself to Engels as "the dissolution of man- kind into monads." Nevertheless, the picture is still curiously lopsided and leaves out of account many of the more positive features of urban life. The Africans who flock into the urban centres are not monads in a "world of brutal indifference where it occurs to no man to honour another with so much as a glance" (Engels 1950:24). Quite to the contrary, what is so universally striking about the life of African towns is its ebullience and gusto, its camaraderie, and the casual ease with which social contacts are established (Wilson and Mafeje 1963; Sampson 1956; Ekwensi 1954). Nor is this simply a reflection of "the peculiar humaneness in African social relations" of which Afri- can intellectuals frequently speak (Worsley 1964:127). The point is that the African who comes to town rarely arrives as a complete stranger. The situation described by Leslie (1963:33) for Dar-es-Salaam prob- ably has universal application: It would be difficult to find a single African who arrived in Dar-es-Salaam knowing not a soul.... Almost every African who decides to come [there] comes to a known address, where lives a known relation; this relation will meet him, take him in and feed him and show him the ropes, help him seek a job... until he considers himself able to launch out for himself and take a room of his own. Every African urban-dweller tends therefore to be involved in a complex network of social relations, composed of ties with neighbours, work-mates, friends, and acquaintances. At the core of the network, how- ever, are those who are readily fitted into the elastic categories of kinship provided by a classificatory system of terminology and those who count as fellow- tribesmen (Epstein 1961). These ties clearly introduce an element of stability into an extremely fluid situa- tion: they link together large numbers of individuals not only within the one town, but between one town and another, and between town and country. More than this, they provide the basis for a more elaborate scheme of organizing social relationships in the new environment. I refer here to what has been variously termed "urban tribalism" (Mitchell 1956a; Epstein 1958), "supertribalism" (Rouch 1956), or "ethnicity" (Wallerstein 1960). As Mitchell has so clearly demon- strated, the "tribalism" that is so prevalent a feature of African urbanism is a phenomenon of a quite dif- ferent order from the "tribalism" of the rural areas: in the latter it refers to a particular kind of social regimen in which social relationships are organized within a distinctive structural and cultural framework; in the former the tribe is no longer an organized po- litical and social unit, but serves rather as a means of classifying a heterogeneous urban population into a limited number of meaningful social categories. Trib- alism in this sense operates in a number of different urban contexts or fields of relationship. Most immedi- ately, it offers a guide to behaviour in situations of 280 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="7">Epstein: URBANIZATION AND SOCIAL CHANGE IN AFRICA casual interaction amongst relative strangers; it pro- vides the primary badge of identity, to which ever the smallest child is able to respond. Tribalism agair tends to be important in the sphere of domestic rela- tionships and leisure time activities: wives tend to b( sought most frequently within the tribe or widei "ethnic group," and it is within this category also that a man most frequently finds his friends and drinkinE companions. Then very frequently, too, the "tribal principle" provides the basis for the formation of associations which serve a variety of functions as mutual aid or burial societies, political pressure groups and the like. The significance of these associations seems to vary from place to place, and since theii character and functions are not always carefully distinguished in the literature, the matter may perhaps be usefully considered here. Tribal associations have sometimes been spoken ol as an adaptive mechanism, easing the adjustment o migrants to the strange surroundings of the town Thus, according to Little (1957:593), the associatior facilitates this adjustment by substituting for the ex tended group of kinsmen a grouping based upon com mon interest which is capable of serving many of th same needs. Balandier seems to be making a similai point when he notes of Brazzaville (quoted in Wal lerstein 1960:478) that the early emergence of ethni( associations tends to indicate a high degree of uproot edness among the ethnic group and is to be founc particularly in small minorities. Support for this vie- is perhaps to be found in the fact that where a par- ticular tribe is dominant in the town, or enjoys a special relationship to it, as in the case of the Gando in Kampala, its members are unlikely to form a se- parate tribal association (cp. Leslie 1963:40). Associations, then, are of different types, cater for different social categories, and serve different ends The form of tribal associationinDar-es-Salaamreferred to earlier seems to have had its origin in the insistence of the German Administration that the dead fror the hospital be buried by their particula-r tribes. Rec- ognized leaders of each tribe were appointed to see that this was done and to report all deaths for entry in the register. In addition, these leaders organizec funeral parties and also periodic dances. They alsc seem to have acted as arbitrators in disputes. Indeed as noted earlier, the arrangement corresponded closely to the institutions of tribal eldership and tribal head- manship which were to develop on the Copperbel and in Freetown. All three served similar purposes none of which required any attempt at incorporation: there was no constituted group with a formal mem- bership and no set of rules to which all were required to subscribe. In short, to apply the term tribal associ- ation to such an arrangement can be very misleading. Certainly, they represent a very different form of organization from such groups as the Temne compins described by Banton (1957), variants of which seem to flourish in West and East Africa. These represent, in a sense, a later phase in the process of urbanization. No longer dominated by the conservative elders, they tend to have a formal membership drawn mainly from amongst the ranks of the young men aspiring to prestige and status in the urban world. This aspect of the groups is at once evident in the number of office- holders and the proliferation of titles as well as in the patterns of their activities. The young men of the Temne compins believed in "civilization," by which they meant the adoption of certain European and Creole practices. (Banton [1957:175, 173] remarks that the food served up at some of their social events resembled the sort fashionable at European cocktail parties.) Since tribe remained the primary category of interaction and therefore a ready means of mobilizing support, leaders in these groups could use them as a stepping stone to political office at the local or national level. Yet another kind of development has been the emergence of large-scale Tribal Unions such as those of the Kenya Luo or some of the Nigerian groups. Of a much higher order of organizational complexity, they constitute in some cases pan-tribal federations providing, as Coleman observes (1960: 319), the infrastructure for comprehensive nationalist movements and competitive political parties. A fourth type of grouping approximates more to the type of exclusive social club. These emerge typically amongst small immigrant groups whose members enjoy a much higher social and economic status than other sections of the urban African community. All of these various forms of organization have their basis in tribalism, but it is equally clear that they cannot be adequately understood as simple manifesta- tions of the "tribal principle." As the towns have grown, their African populations have been increas- ingly diversified in terms of occupation, formal educa- tion, and style of life. This does not necessarily imply the emergence within the towns of a class structure on the Western model. On the other hand, a number of studies do attest to the development of systems of social stratification defined in terms of status groups in the Weberian sense (Xydias 1956; Michell and Ep- stein 1959; Schwab 1961). For many years it was a commonplace in the literature of urban sociology that associations have an overriding importance in the social organization of the town, but this view has come to be increasingly challenged. Various empirical studies in the United States (e.g., Komarovsky 1946; Dotson 1951) and Britain (e.g., Bottomore 1950; Stacey 1960) have shown a close connection between membership of associations and socioeconomic status: the lower one's position on the scale, the fewer the associations to which one belongs. My own evidence from the Copperbelt presents a similar picture, and I suspect it is equally valid elsewhere in Africa. The vast majority of recent immigrants to towns are not "joiners," and it seems to me to be an obscuring of the sociological issues to argue, as Little has recently done (1965:24), that the growth of voluntary associations represents the newly arrived migrants' response to urban conditions, "a spontaneous adjustment to their environment." I would argue rather that tribal associa- tions have to be understood in their relationship to associations of other types and to the over-all status system that has developed within the community. A recent study carried out in Kampala (Parkin 1965) brings out the close relationship between membership in various associations (tribal and otherwise), residence in different urban neighbourhoods and localities, and the total status system. Accounts of Kampala (e.g., Southall 1956a; Southall and Gutkind 1956) suggest Vol. 8. No.-4 . October 1967 281</page><page sequence="8">closer affinities with the urban centres of West Africa than with those of Central or South Africa. Similar detailed studies in one or other of the great West African cities might go a long way to explaining the "exuberant growth" of voluntary associations there and at the same time help to provide a more adequate picture of West African urbanism. RELATIONS BETWEEN TOWNS We have seen that circulation of population between town and country is a characteristic feature of social life in much of contemporary Africa. There is also considerable movement between towns. For example, Mitchell (1953) has shown that newcomers to the Copperbelt move about a good deal in the first five years of their residence, and then settle down in one town. This raises at once important questions about the spatial distribution of urban centres within a country, the relations that develop between them, and the implications that variation in these regards has for social change, particularly in the political field. Curi- ously enough, these topics find little mention in the anthropological literature, but they are touched upon by Coleman, a political scientist (1960:273). Many countries of Africa are, in effect, "one-city states," and the single major city, also the territorial capital, often dominates such a country's political life. Coleman develops the argument that this circumstance permits concentration of political activity in one place and thus facilitates the mobilization of political strength. By contrast, in those countries having two or more major cities, such as Zambia (Lusaka vs. the Copper- belt), Rhodesia (Bulawayo vs. Salisbury), or the Congo (Leopoldville vs. Elizabethville), African political leadership has been dispersed, if not competitive, and it has been far more difficult to organize a compre- hensive nationalist party on a territorial basis. This argument. has considerable merits, but it seems to me to miss a point that is very relevant for the under- standing of urbanization: what is important here is not so much the number of different foci of interest, but how the different centres are involved with one another. Zambia and the Congo present an interest- ing contrast from this point of view. The Congo centres were not only physically distant from one another, but their industrial structures were also quite different. In addition, they tended to draw their African populations from quite different areas. In short, there appears to have been little convergence between them and it would be interesting to know what kind of communication took place between the major Congo cities. By comparison, in the towns of the Copperbelt, while there were frequently concentrations of particular tribes in any given town, in the main all the principal urban centres drew on the same territorial population. The number of the towns and their close physical proximity to one another meant that they stood out in opposition to one another as towns. Each in time developed its own subtle distinctiveness, so that it used to be said, for example, that some of the Copperbelt towns had characteristic styles of drum- ming and dress. Opposition between the towns was expressed through the football league and other forms of competition. There were also links which cut across these divisions: members of opposing football clubs from different towns were drawn from the same tribal groups; citizens of different towns were yet members of the same trade unions; and all townsmen, the "sugarboys," contrasted themselves with the rural bumpkins. In short, for an understanding of the role of urbanization in developing new sets of identities, a key question would seem to be to what extent the growth of towns gives rise to a system of cross-cutting ties and allegiances. TOWN, COUNTRY, AND NATION The process of urbanization thus has several aspects. One, the demographic, involves the redistribution of population as people move from rural to urban areas. A second refers to participation in social relations in town and the changes in behaviour patterns which such participation involves. These are closely related processes, though, as Mitchell reminds us (1956b:694), they need to be kept analytically distinct. The third aspect of urbanization is a "feed-back" process; it is concerned with the influence of town on country and the implications of urban growth for social change. Wilson (1941-42) has anallyzed brilliantly the con- comitants of a system of migrant labour, showing how instead of stimulating an agricultural revolution in the reserves to match the industrial revolution in the towns, it led to rural deterioration. Circulation of population between town and country did something to ameliorate these conditions, since a certain amount of wealth did filter back in this way to the tribal areas. Circulation of the population was, as Wilson noted, "the keystone of the unstable arch of present day Northern Rhodesia economy." This, however, is only one aspect of the impact of town and country. The towns are the locus of the new civilization: here are to be found new concentrations of economic and political power, and the new avenues of communica- tions along which the influences of the towns may reach out into the countryside in varied and subtle ways. The important questions to be asked here are therefore: What are the relations of town and country? More specifically, since we are concerned with coun- tries most of which have only recently attained nationhood, what implications do the varying features of urban social systems have for national integration? Two assumptions commonly underlie much discus- sion of this aspect of urbanization: (1) that towns inevitably act as instruments of social transformation; and (2) that change is uniformly in the same direction and of the same character. Both seem to derive from the fact that the model of urban-rural relations has frequently been constructed around the response of a single tribe or area, which was deemed to be typical. Wilson's study of Broken Hill, where the analysis concentrated on the experience of the Bemba, is a case in point. Had he examined the position of the neighbouring Mambwe, Wilson might well have been led to modify his conclusions (cf. Watson 1958). More recent studies suggest that both assumptions may need to be qualified. In some parts, for example, far from bringing about a transformation in the countryside, 282 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="9">Epstein: URBANIZATION AND SOCIAL CHANGE IN AFRICA the pull of the towns becomes, paradoxically, a means by which the traditional system in the reserves is per- petuated. Here rural-urban relations are in a state of relatively stable equilibrium. Thus amongst the Pedi and other South African groups, where land is critic- ally short, the export of surplus man-power to the towns does not merely prevent the disintegration of the rural social system, but positively reinforces that system (Sansom 1965). The network of rural ties is maintained in the towns, where kinsmen and others assist one another in getting jobs, frequently with the same firm, and finding accommodation. Moreover, individuals who achieve influential positions in the towns can translate them into positions of prestige within the tribal system when eventually they return home. It is against this kind of background that one has to understand the remarkable persistence in East London, a city that has been established for more than a hundred years, of the division between "Red" and "School" Xhosa. Incapsulated within their amakhaya cells, "Red" Xhosa may spend many years in town and yet apparently remain carefully insulated from the typical diversions and blandishments that the city has to offer; they are in the town, but never of it (Mayer 1961). The response, then, of different groups to the pull of the towns is not uniform. Some groups, for example the Ila of Zambia or the Masai of Kenya, have (for reasons which are still imperfectly understood) con- sistently rejected town life. The responses of others have been conditioned by features of the indigenous culture and social structure, or even in some cases by special constitutional arrangements, such as those once enjoyed by the Barotse of Zambia (which from time to time created difficulties between the Barotse and other tribes in the towns). Such differences are reflected in different patterns of incorporation into the life of the town. In Lunsar, Sierra Leone, for example, the traditionally slave-owning and Muslimized Fulbe (Fula) seek to minimize their involvement with other groups, and they do this by avoiding manual occupa- tions or others which would involve status inferiority: they work as tailors or as petty tradeis and the like (Butcher 1965). (Yao on the Copperbelt, also tradition- ally slave-owners and Muslims, are also to be found predominantly in the category of the self-employed.) In his study of Stanleyville, Pons (1965) has examined in some detail the strikingly different patterns of urban incorporation of the Babua, Lokele, and Topoke. None of this, of course, is to be taken to mean that we are dealing with a simple transplantation of the tribal system into an urban context. As Wallerstein points out (1960:477), the emergence of modern ethnic groups is a function of the urban social situation. On the other hand, unless we take into account the dif- ferent constellations of rural-urban relations, we can- not hope to understand the significance that ethnicity comes to assume in the wider political field. Waller- stein argues indeed that ethnicity serves to aid national integration in a number of ways. Yet if the towns are new focal points of integration, they are also a fertile source of conflict, so that ethnicity may come tO play an important part in shaping, in some cases perhaps even dominating, the character of national politics. Thus it has been said of the Congo that ethnic nation- Congolese of different origins, speaking different languages, intermingled. These contacts, far from "bringing their hearts close together," only made them more conscious of their differences and strengthened their feelings of mutual alienation (van Wing, quoted in Lemarchand 1964:99). Yet this development has not been universal, even in the Congo, and clearly a num- ber of different factors are at work. There is the question of the number of different tribes represented and the relative positions of strength or influence they have been able to achieve in the new setting. The dominance of a single group, for numerical or other reasons, is likely to stimulate ethnic particularism among the other tribes. The converse of this proposi- tion is illustrated in Stanleyville where, according to Lemarchand (1964), the ethnic diversity of its popula- tion was the main reason for its conspicuous indif- ference to the appeals of ethnic nationalism. There were, as one of Lemarchand's African informants observed, too many tribes in Stanleyville, and none of them had any striking predominance. A second relevant factor is the emergence of an urban class structure. One might expect that the relationships of social class that build up in towns would tend to cut across the divisions of tribe. This does happen, but what also seems to occur frequently is that the lines of an incipient class structure correspond with tribal or ethnic differences (e.g., McCulloch 1956). Once again, if ethnic particularism is a product of the towns, it also has to be understood in the context of perduring rural-urban relations. The differential response to, and participation in, the life of the town amongst the tribes may also be an expression of dif- ferent regional interests. For example, Mitchell and I have shown that while "tribalism" is a primary cate- gory of social interaction amongst Africans in the towns of the Copperbelt, the tribal nexus is frequently cross-cut by membership in trade unions, staff asso- ciations, and other bodies. On the other hand, there are some groups which do not appear to become involved in the urban "melting-pot," a notable instance being the Ila of the Southern Province of Zambia, a group with a long-established reputation for aggressive inde- pendence and preoccupation with their cattle. (The African opposition party in contemporary Zambia, the African National Congress, whose leader is a Muila, draws its main support from the Southern and Central Provinces amongst the congeries of people known as the Bantu Botatwe.) Again, regional interests seem to lie behind the formation of large tribal unions in Nigeria and the intense struggles that have gone on over the years between the Ibo and Yoruba (Mercier 1965:490-93; Coleman 1958). When emergence of different political parties expresses the diversity of regional interests rather than more purely ideological differences, there may be much less room for the operation of cross-cutting ties. Presumably these factors I have just been outlining weigh heavily on political leaders striving to create a new nation: perhaps from this point of view they may contribute something to our understanding of the emergence of one-party states in Africa and of the opposition in some parts between the new national leadership and Vol. 8 . No. 4 . October 1967 283</page><page sequence="10">SITUATIONAL CHANGE AND CULTURAL PERSISTENCE The African who leaves his village to come to town at once enters a new world whose symbols are in- creasingly, in Louis Wirth's words, the factory whistle and the traffic light. The town has its own physical structure; but more than this, it has its own structure of social relations. Viewed against the background of tribal life, urban existence involves changes-what Mitchell (1966) has recently suggested we should call CCsituational" as distinct from "processive" or historical change-in almost every department of social life: in family and kinship relations, in types of association and grouping and forms of leadership, in the use of leisure, and in patterns of speech (Epstein 1959). In- deed, given the common technological base of modern urban society, claims such as that "the social structure of urban Africans is increasingly tending... to ap- proximate more closely to Western institutions" (Hell- mann 1956:743) might appear at first sight as self- evident. However, two points need to be noted. First, the processes of urban social growth in Africa are not automatic or pre-determined. African urbanism, as I have repeatedly stressed, is not characterized by uniformity, and Hellmann's delineation of the South African situation has clearly less immediate relevance to West Africa. Secondly, as Hellmann herself argued on an earlier occasion (1937:432), the Africans are not a supine people, and their incorporation into the wage-earning economy of the towns has not involved the complete submergence of their indigenous culture. Abstract In recent years anthropologists have been taking an increasing interest in the process of urbanization in Africa, usually seen as an aspect of the wider issue of social and/or cultural change. As individual studies accumulate, we need to develop a framework within which to examine the variables that shape the struc- ture of social relations in modern African towns and cities. Three main determinants of urban social structure are isolated and analyzed: (1) the "industrial" struc- ture, i.e., the organizational framework through which the town seeks to achieve those economic aims and purposes that brought it into existence, or give it its present importance; (2) the ""civic" structure, which derives from the policies and practices of its ad- Mitchell (1965) shows how Africans in Salisbury con- tinue to interpret their experience of personal mis- fortune in the urban world in terms of categories and assumptions that have their roots in tribal culture and society. I would argue from this that in the study of urban social relations we need to pay attention to content as well as to form. For example, the African trade union leader may be expected to have much in common with his English counterpart; to be successful, he must be able to organize, to hold and sway an audience, and to negotiate. The character of his leader- ship will also be shaped, however, by his own concep- tion of his role and the expectations which his followers have of him, and these may be very dif- ferent from those of a typical British trade unionist. Thus for many Africans on the Copperbelt the union leader takes on many of the. attributes of the tribal chief and is expected to behave like one in certain contexts. African urban institutions, even when most closely fashioned on an alien model, do not become a mere mirror-image of the prototype; they become infused with elements that derive from African tribal culture. As I mentioned at the outset, urbanization and Westernization often go closely together in modern Africa, but analytically they must not be confused. It was this point which presumably Hodgkin had in mind when he spoke of the capacity of African townsmen to create a new indigenous civilization. All the studies I have cited in this paper refer, unfortunately, to the "colonial past." As studies come to be made of urbanization and urbanism under conditions of independence we may hope to see such questions as these explored much further. ministration; and (3) the demographic factor, which involves the nature and degree of movement of popu- lation between rural and urban areas. In the light of these variables, the structure of social relations in the town itself may be examined. The discussion focuses mainly on three types of relation- ship: (1) "network" relations; (2) categorical rela- tions, e.g., tribalism; and (3) formal or associational relations. Towns however are not self-contained social entities, but have their place within a wider field of social relationships. The study of urbanization needs also to include therefore the analysis of relations be- tween the various towns themselves, as well as those of rural and urban areas. Employing this framework of analysis we are in a better position to examine the varying role of the towns in achieving national integration in the developing countries of Africa. Comments by EDWARD M. BRUNER* Urbana, Ill., U.S.A. 17 x 66 The strength of this paper is that it summarizes a series of empirical find- ings that have emerged in recent studies of African urbanization, and it presents them in terms of a theoretical position that takes off from the views advanced by Max Gluckman. Epstein goes beyonid Gluckman, but my comment is that he does not go far enough. I agree with Epstein's conclusions but suggest that he is still operating within a Gluckman-type framework, which somewhat befuddles our understanding of the urbanization process, particular- ly in larger comparative perspective. Gluckman and his colleagues, despite their outstanding contributions to the study of towns and, of course, to social anthropology in general, are Africa-bound. Gluckman tells us to view urban data in an urban context rather than against a village-tribal-rural back- ground. He says we cannot explain social relations in the city simply by reference to the forms of social rela- 284 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="11">FhtP;n TTURBANTZATTON ANDT SOCTAT. CHANGE TN AFRTCA tions that exist in the village, and that we must take full account of the urban situation in which these relations have developed and in which they are ex- pressed. All students of urbanization, I believe, would agree with Epstein that Gluckman's views, at the time they were expressed, served as an "in- valuable corrective" to earlier ex- cesses. Urbanization had long been seen rather negatively, as progressive disintegration from a pristine "tribal" system. Epstein is critical of Gluckman's position because it does not shed light on the process of becoming a towns- man nor on the degree of commitment to urban life and to urban. behavior patterns. We know that residence in an urban center does not automatical- ly make a man urbanized. Epstein also states that Gluckman treats all towns as if they were alike, and he points up the importance, of dealing with variations in urban social systems. These are valid points. When Epstein deals with rural areas and the village background, he does so in the limited sense of considering rural-urban relations; but he still does not take into account the larger societal context in which these rela- tions are embedded. He writes about the rural and the urban as if they were two separate and partially autonomous systems. In the Copperbelt region and in the areas of Africa studied by an- thropologists associated with the Rhodes-Livingstone Institute, there may have been a legal, political, and social separation between the village and the city. Elsewhere in Africa, there is less discontinuity between the rural and the urban; and in- countries like Japan and Mexico with a long urban tradition and an established state organization, rural and urban areas have become even more similar. Here a rural migrant to the city confronts people very much like him- self. We are in effect dealing, in parts of Africa, with temporary labor migration rather than with more permanent urbanization and with a tribal-colonial situation rather than with a developed indigenous civiliza- tion. These aspects of the larger context make a vast difference in the nature of the urbanization process. The less discontinuity there is be- tween rural and urban areas, the less applicable is the Gluckman viewpoint. The rural and the urban are never completely independent and autono- mous; they are invariably related in many diverse and subtle ways. Ep- stein's major weakness in this paper is that he does not take account of the diversity, but sees urbanization pro- cesses almost entirely as a function of factors intrinsic to the city itself. The industrial structure, for ex- ample, is seen as an aspect of town organization; but degree of in- dustrialization, one of the key vari- ables in the urbanization process, cannot be localized within the boundaries of a city. Industrialization is a function of a larger region and influences the nature of social life for all who reside within the region, whether they live in a city, town, or hamlet. The fact that Urbana, Illinois, is not an industrial town is less im- portant for understanding the quality of social relations within Urbana than the fact it is located in the American Midwest. Again, Epstein relates the forms of associational life to the civic structure of the town, and his observations here are very suggestive; but administrative services provided through the city government, such as welfare services, are more dependent upon national-level institutions than upon local urban ones. Epstein makes some excellent com- ments on ethnicity and tribalism which I have found to be applicable to many areas of Indonesia as well as to the African cases cited. It is clear that tribalism in the village is not the same as tribalism in the city. But again, the nature and extent of "urban tribalism" is not entirely dependent upon local characteristics of specific cities. It is a function of the nation or region. In countries with many different ethnic groups in which no one group has a majority, we may find the same degree of urban tribalism in a wide variety of different towns, irrespective of variations in industrial or civil structure. All of us working in this field are interested in how people live in cities and in how social life changes as a consequence of urban residence. We must be careful, however, not to assume too firm or direct a connection between where one lives and how one lives. Culture patterns are not so dependent upon locality or place of residence, nor does the city influence all aspects of life to the same extent. Family life in an administrative city such as Washington, D.C. may not differ at all from family life in Gary, Indiana, particularly for those whose occupations are not linked to the ad- ministrative or industrial structure of their respective cities. In any case, Epstein is moving in the right direction. He has made a number of insightful comments and has presented us with a fine summary of recent research in Africa. by PETER C. W. GUTKIND* Montreal, Canada. 13 X 66 As early as 1931, Julian Huxley predicted in his Africa View that "Towns will certainly be the crux of the native problem in the tropics;" and if the recently launched African Urban Notes is a reliable guide to re- search currently in progress, clearly a large number of social scientists have decided that urban life in Africa is an important feature of the general trans- formation of the continent. It is quite., clear that we have come a long way since Epstein (1958:224) wrote: "As a field of study, African urbanism is still largely virgin territory, in which much of the preliminary spade-work has yet to be done." The days of the generalized urban survey are over; we are moving into more structured in- vestigations. Thus Epstein's helpful summary of some, but by no means all, of the literature and his critique and suggestions for alternative lines of investigation are appropriately timed. Epstein states his main theme as the examination of "some of the variables that shape the structure of social re- lations in modern African towns." Contributions are badly needed, how- ever, not only from social anthropo- logists, but also from political scientists, economists, historians, and others who might not cast their conceptualization in such a framework. We must be more eclectic. The study of urban systems provides scope for many disciplines, and we still need solid empirical studies judiciously blended with fresh theoretical approaches. For one thing, we have tended to con- centrate on the large urban areas at the expense of the smaller centers and townships. Thus we have often learn- ed a good deal about the main features of the capital city, as these have crystallized by the time research got under way, but little about the pro- cesses of urban growth and urbanism in its early phases. We have often concentrated on the atypical urban structure. Particularly in West Africa, where there are many small towns and even more small townships under 5,000 in population, much interesting work on the lines of the Lunsar (Sierra Leone) study must be undertaken. We also need to put some order into the large number of variables, many of which we have not yet rigorously isolated and controlled, which many researchers have suggested as an- chorages for controlled comparative research. Without such research we cannot hope to arrive at general ex- planations. This in turn might suggest that we need to pay more attention to the specific methodologies required in African urban research. It is possible that we social anthro- pologists, reared on the "rural tradi- tion of the tribe," lack the techniques (particularly in the field of demog- raphy) to work in societies less homo- Vol. 8 .

We may be led to take too structural an approach, ignoring the enormous range of personal behaviour and institutional arrange- ments to be found in urban Africa. No clear and consistent model of African urban life has yet developed. In- dividuals and groups are all engaged in a battle to keep their heads above water. Each African urbanite manip- ulates the social, economic, and political order to such an extent, and in such a variety of ways, that at times there appear to be as many adaptations to urban life in Africa as there are Africans living in the new and older towns on that continent. Of course, this is not the case. African urban society is not an indeterminate, amorphous mass. Rather, its coherence is based upon characteristics of social organization which we have not always seen in this light. In order to understand this coher- ence, it is probably wise to select relatively small units for observation. Even the smaller urban areas in Africa have developed an internal complexity which calls for a com- parative study of specific neighbour- hoods, particular occupational and political groupings, and special interest groups of all sorts. If the urban areas of Africa are composites of a large number of discrete and/or overlapping subsystems, then micro-rather than macro-studies should have priority. Many West African towns are of such a size now that we find towns within towns and a wide variety of neighbour- hoods; within the towns of Eastern and Southern Africa, housing estates may differ markedly one from the other. I doubt very much that we have reached the stage in which we can order "within a single framework the material accumulated in numerous studies of urbanization and urbanism in Africa." A single framework will lead invariably to the very tendency which Epstein deplores: the "tendency to view urbanization too simplistical- ly." We simply do not know enough yet about urbanization in Africa in general terms. I cannot share Epstein's or Mayer's criticism of Gluckman's formulation, for it seems to me that Gluckman helped us specifically to look for the very particular processes of becoming a townsman when he wrote: "An African townsman is a townsman, and an African miner is a miner." This is the point of theoretical articulation. What Mayer calls Gluckman's "alter- nation model" does not preclude in- sight into the processes of growth and change. Besides, the fact remains that urban Africans do often, although less so today, move from town to country and back again. What I would like to see (and Epstein hints at this) are a number of exploratory studies show- ing how urban Africans-of whatever length of urban residence-view the urban areas in which they live, or why they move from one town to another or from one neighbourhood in the same town to another. I think that studies like these might help us to sort out how particularistic perception is cross-cut by universalistic character- istics of organization. Epstein himself has carried out such a study (see Ep- stein 1961). We need many more studies of the activities of individuals and groups if we are to find out how Africans interpret, and handle, their urban experiences. We will then be able to show why some urban Africans maintain their ties with tribal culture while others become new urbanites. We should also pay greater attention to the study of the social problems which are increasingly manifest in the urban areas of Africa. Poverty, vice, and the predicaments of unemploy- ment, now faced by millions of Africans, present an endless variety of social situations which open up im- portant features of social organization of African urban life. Finally, we need far more time perspective in African urban studies. Thus far our studies have been almost wholly synchronic, although most of us have felt the need to give a little historical depth. What we need are more diachronic studies whereby we keep under observation the older and the newer African towns and town- ships over considerable periods of time. Demographers tell us that some towns grow in population by as much as 10% per year. If this is so, we must look at each of these towns at least once every three years. This calls for coordinated research. by MICHAEL M. HOROWITZ* Binghamton, N.Y., U.S.A. 21 XI 66 In this very welcome paper, Epstein properly insists on a conceptual distinction between the culture of cities and the processes of their development, and makes a useful division of the process of urbanization into demographic (and ecologic?), structural, and cultural aspects. I shall limit myself to a brief comment on ethnic organization. Once Whyte (1943) had documented the social organization of an urban slum, shortly after the publication of Wirth's article referred to by Epstein, there was little reason to continue in the belief that urban social relation- ships "tend to be impersonal, super- Ficial, transitory, and segmental." The phenomenon of "urban tribalism" is recurrent wh erever cities receive migrants from diverse ethnic back- ,rounds . Where mobility is severely restricted, or possible only in terms of a whole group advancing its interests against some other group, "urban tribalism" seems to be quite durable, and the city has the features of pluralism. The towns of the classic Sudanic states had these characteristics: economic activi- ties were distributed among ethnic seg- ments, and all were subject to the political domination of one of them. Superficially, at least, this resembles the colonial situation in many places. In the modern town, ethnic seg- mentation is probably transitional. The individual may see his advantage either in identification with an ethnic segment or in membership in some other association. Choosing the latter can involve risking the security of an ordinary life among kinsmen and neighbors for the chance of greater rewards among strangers. The rewards of ethnic association are more im- mediately intelligible to the migrant; those of other associations are more remote. Where there are encourage- ments for individual mobility through the sequential acquisition of statuses, we expect the ethnic association to have a less enduring appeal. This has been the experience, of course, of many European immigrants to American cities. The migrants were met by relatives and countrymen, who found for them housing, employment, membership in the landsmenschaften, and even a burial plot. The ethnic group became politically organized, facilitating the entry of members into positions of power. In the long run, however, individuals found greater advantages in other contexts (e.g., the trade union, political party, church, corporation, school, army, etc.), and the "tribe" as a socially functional unit declined, to survive principally in cul- tural identifications such as the pref- erence for certain foods, or clothing, or woment. by KENNETH L. LITTLE* Edinburgh, Scotland. 14 ix 66 The growing number of students interested in African urbanization will derive great benefit from Epstein's informative and well-balanced critique of research done in this field. His essay provides a remarkably succinct analysis of many of the sociological issues involved. I welcome in particular the distinc- tion he makes between "'urbanization" and "urbanism," and I am glad that he draws attention to the problem of variation in urban social systems. Thus, in West Africa, not only is there less discontinuity between rural and urban social behaviour than in the central and southern parts of the Continent, but Africans participate Z86 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="13">F1,ctpyv, iTTRAMT7&amp;ATnWT AMTT QOC.TAT .TJANT.F. TNT APDTrA freely at every level of society. Ep- stein's article throws less light on the structural implications of the latter phenomenon than it does on the effects of tribal migration. Admittedly, he wrote before the appearance of some relevant publications, but a good deal of work was available by Mercier, as well as by other French and British authors. In particular, much has been written about new types of marriage and of the family, and also about the function in urbanization of new religious movements and cults. In the West African context these matters are fundamental to the theoretical orienta- tions that Epstein considers. Epstein rightly casts doubt on the assumption that towns inevitably act as instruments of social transforma- tion and that change is uniformly in the same direction and of the same character. Epstein contrasts Wilson's (1941-42) conclusions about the Bemba with the response to social change of the neighbouring Mambwe reported by Watson (1958); but he does not explain in this regard that the urban/rural relation may depend partly on government policy. Van Velsen's (1961) study, for instance, makes it very plain that Tonga migrants continue to adhere to their rural villages largely because the ad- ministration of their home territory is based upon "tribal integrity." I accept, however, Epstein's stricture e.i my own simplification of associ- ational growth. It is true that many recent immigrants to towns are not "joiners." Consequently, to speak of the growth of voluntary associations as a "spontaneous adjustment" to urban conditions obscures the socio- logical issue. On the other hand, the migrant, if illiterate and unskilled, generally does depend upon "practises of mutuality" even though the group concerned may not become institution- alized in the sense that one formally joins it. I agree, therefore, with Ep- stein that we need much more detailed information about the larger West African towns. This would include the informal networks which involve interaction not only between fellow migrants but between established urbanities. Such knowledge, in turn, would throw light upon the asso- ciational structure. by DANIEL F. MCCALL* Boston, Mass., U.S.A. 6 x 66 At the risk of oversimplification of each, I shall attempt three comments in the allotted space: 1) For several years Mitchell and Epstein and others have reiterated that mere residence in towns is an index of urbanization in demographic terms but Sociologists who have studied im migrant groups in the U.S.A. hav long known that peasant attitude persisted long after transplanting o European rural families to America cities. Neither African urban anthro pologists nor American sociologist have worked out any measures for thi psychological aspects of urbanization Could the concept of "scale" pu forward by Wilson (1954) be usefu here? If urbanization constitutes change of scale for the new town dweller, then his mental herizons mus be stretched. Content analysis ol samples of newspapers, radio programs union officials' speeches, etc. couplec with a check of informants' frequenc3 of exposure to the media and ar observation of behavior, includinE verbal, ought to yield an index ol attitude change if the contrastinE traditional pattern has been recorded A great deal of time and wori would be involved in the analysis ol several media and much more ir projecting a reasonable sized sample o: informants against the resultant. Also there is obviously not one traditional pattern, but several, and each must be as rigorously established as the "urban" pattern. 2) The "emergence of Africar businessmen" in West Africa (p. 279) is not the consequence of cash crops The diary of Antra Duke (see Forde 1956) attests to the existence of businessmen in the 18th century. Businessmen trading wih Europeans were also common in the 17th century, as is clear from many published accounts, and, at least in the interior, the prototype had already been well known for centuries. "Double-towns" in Western Africa were always the in'dication of a continuous turnover of strangers, coming and going on the stimulus of commerce and enjoying while tempo- rarily resident a kind of extraterritori- ality. The state system in this region was a network of city-states competing for trade; empires were but the military control of many city-states by one. The continuity of urbanism in Africa is not to be obscured by the sharp increase in size and numbers of cities as a consequence of industrializa- tion, for the same distinction between the pre-industrial and the industrial city is to be seen in Europe. The idea that urbanism was previously only characteristic of the Yoruba (see e.g., Gibbs 1965:547) indicates familiarity with Bascom's stu'dies and a tendency to put others (e.g., Miner 1953; Monteil 1900) in another category. Hausa and Mende people were at least as urban as the Yoruba. 3) A typology of associations is needed. The type observed in the Gold Coast prior to independence was different from that of Nigeria and Sierra Leone. Headmen of "strangers' communities" were elected, and their office followed an attenuated pattern of chieftaincy in the home area. by PHILIP MAYER* Durham City, England. 28 xi 66 Epstein's paper seems to me to serve two purposes admirably: to draw attention to the fast-accumulating material on African urbanisation and to indicate some of the areas of chief theoretical interest. Possibly it sometimes leans towards the near- obvious (e.g., in stressing that African towns vary greatly, that urbanisation is not uni-dimensional, or that it is analytically desirable to distinguish be- tween urbanism and urbanisation, or between urbanisation and westernisa- tion), but it also offers much stimulus to thought. Epstein proposes a typology which is intended to refine the distinction between "old-established" indigenous towns and "new" mostly European- created towns (Southall's type A and type B). He shows that African towns differ from each other both in regard to their industrial structures and in regard to their civic structures. This seems to me a useful way to deploy material. I am not sure, however, that the analysis materially advances our understanding of urbanisation, or that it is correct to single out the inidustrial and civic aspects as "determinants of" urban social structure. Are they not simply intrinsic to it, along with many other things? Granted that one can "classify the towns of Africa by the positions they occupy along a continuum defined in terms of civic structures," why is this continuum necessarily more significant than the many others that could be construct- ed-e.g., between towns with rapidly circulating population and with re- latively stable population; mono- tribal and multi-tribal towns; towns with more christianised and less christianised population, or more rnoslemised and less moslemised popu- Lation, etc.? It seems to me that dif- ferent criteria of classification will assume importance according to the problems being investigated and that there cannot be a master key. Epstein rightly points out that tribal associations in town "are of different types, cater for different social -ategories and serve different ends," 3nd he proposes a distinction of three types. Again, I have some reservations ibout his criteria. He does not distin- Ouish , for instance, associations th at lre based on the bond of a common Vol. 8 . No. 4 . October 1967 287</page><page sequence="14">home place (outside the town) from those based on a more general categor- ical similarity of "tribal interest." This distinction is important if one wishes to ascertain whether a tribal associ- ation mainly reflects cultural and tribal oppositions within the town or also reinforces its members' extra- town ties (Mayer 1964). It may be because Epstein does not make this distinction that he takes exception to Little's proposition that the growth of voluntary associations represents the newly arrived migrants' response to urban conditions. ("The vast majority of recent immigrants to town are not joiners," Epstein thinks.) I would say that where tribal associations are based on the home-place principle they are very likely to attract newcomers, as Little has proposed, though they may not do so where they are based on other principles. Epstein poses the question "What, then, are we to understand by urbanization?" but here neither offers an effective answer nor gives sufficient consideration to previous models. He postulates a distinction between "social structural and cultural" aspects of urbanisation (cf. my analyses of East London, South Africa [Mayer 1961, esp. Chapters 1 and 18]) but does not follow this up in detail. In these respects, then, the article whets the theoretical appetite more than satisfies it. It would be good to have an expanded version, with Epstein's own theoretical standpoint set out more explicitly. by HORACE MINER* Ann Arbor, Mich., U.S.A. 11 x 66 The main thrust of Epstein's discussion lies in his attempt to discern the more significant causes of social change in Africa as evidenced in studies of its towns and cities. His essay at theoret- ical synthesis cannot be evaluated simply in terms of its coverage of the literature. Instead, his propositions should be judged largely in terms of their internal logic, their conformity with the evidence, and their adequacy in the light of other theoretical systems. As his synthesis is to some extent an elaboration of Southall's earlier one (1961), we may seek part of Epstein's distinctive contribution in the differ- ences between the two, particularly in his "determinants of urban social structure." Southall conceives utban social change in Africa as being influenced by factors which are extrinsic to social relationships in the local situation. His use of "extrinsic" is not further specified, but the factors are listed roughly as follows: demography; the nature of urban-rural (tribal) links: degree of ethnic diversity; extent of industrialization; occupational characteristics and income distribution; housing policy and administration; the strength of missions and world religions. Southall recognizes the interrelated and overlapping nature of many of these. In general, Epstein has moved in the direction of reducing the overlap among Southall's factors by collapsing some into single variables and by eliminating the religious ones. He has also moved toward a more formally scientific statement of relationships. Southall's "factors" which "affect" social relationships have become "variables" which "shape" or "deter- mine' social structure. Epstein's three determinants are clearly to be regard- ed as independent variables in the urbanization process. What is not clear is his basis for selection of the in- dependent variables, two of which, like the dependent variables, are aspects of the social structure. He does not (as does Southall) characterize his factors as "extrinsic," which term at least suggests their distinctive nature. Nor does he provide any theoretical scheme to show how the determinants are interrelated or why they should have the effects he describes. There is little to say about his treat- ment of the demographic variable, in which he follows Mitchell, except perhaps to add reference to the principal summary of thz- subject by Lorimer, Brass, and Van de Walle (1965). Turning to the economic variable, the results of Epstein's out- standing research on African towns contributed to Southall's formulation of economic factors. Epstein's "in- dustrial structure" points to a more generic variable than Southall's. The "industrial" part of a town's social structure is said to be that ""through which the town seeks to achieve those economic aims and purposes that brought it into existence, or give it its present importance." Such purposes include industrial production, trans- shipment, trade, and governmental ad- ministration. Regarding the last item, his anthropomorphic description of a city's economic aims tends to blur the fact that administration has political as well as economic functions. His deterministic attribution of urban origins to economic purposes also dis- regards those non-economic functions of cities to which the growth of capitals, holy cities, and university towns has been attributed. It may be useful, therefore, to indicate a theoretical position being elaborated elsewhere (Miner 1967) which brings the two frames of reference together in the present context. Sharing Epstein's dissatisfaction with the basic characterization of the city in terms of population size and lensity, with or without Wirth's 'heterog,eneity," I have found it fruit- .ul to focus, as Epstein does in another -ontext, on the relationship of the irban community to the wider social ,tructure. In these terms, a universal- .y recognized attribute of cities is their dominance over hinterlands. This -ontrol is to a great extent economic, but also derives from such institution- alized power systems as those of government, religion, and education. That which brings cities into existence and gives them their distinctive character is the control function they perform for the society at large. Most urbanites engage in community maintenance occupations, but the mix :f externally oriented functions of any town determines much of its internal social structure, as Reiss (1956) has demonstrated for the United States. Similar effects are indicated in the research literature on African oc- cupational and status differentiation, which receives rather scant attention from Epstein despite his contributions in this area. His delineation and discussion of cc"civic structure" is not as successful as Southall's treatment of the same phenomena. Neither the nature of civic structure nor the way in which it is a "determinant" of social structure is made clear. We are told that the civic structure of a town "derives from the policies and practices of its administra- tion." His examples indicate that civic structure is a variable embracing the degree to which discriminatory control is exerted by whites over African movement, housing, and living con- ditions, although Epstein is strangely loath to put it in so many words. Perhaps this is because his description of the "scale" of civic structure is peculiarly tied to the African scene, rather than being expressed in more general terms. In any case, we are not informed what civic structure causes, unless it is particular local forms of discrimination, which would appear to be redundant. He seems to say that the implementation of administrative policies of discriminatory white control over African living brings about dis- criminatory patterns of urban life; but are not the administrative policies the very thing we need to explain? The most relevant theoretical considera- tions would appear to concern minorities, race relations, and pluralism as dealt with by such scholars as Leo Kuper, Balandier, Van den Berghe, and M. G. Smith. Finally, anyone interested in the history of ideas, or in what is still the clearest conceptual treatment of the phenomena involved in Epstein's deter- minants, should refer to Mitchell's "external imperatives" (1960, 1966), which preceded Southall's "extrinsic factors." 288 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="15">L . r T% - . - . - - - L ._ n. _ ... -. .. .. r A - . : ^- . TT T TS - _ TF . T_ . ' - - - Pittsburgh, Pa., U.S.A. 5 x 66 The grand scope of Epstein's paper, and the clarity and logic of its design, merit much praise. The author is to be commended for his daring attempt to relate the variables of industry, administration, and demography to processes of urbanization and systems of urban social relations. While we cannot expect him to give equal con- sideration to all the factors each of us might personally consider relevant, I do feel that he did not sufficiently stress history. In my opinion it is not possible to understand African urban social relations without taking into account the histories of ethnic groups and regions. For example, the fact that southern Nigerians came into early and prolonged contact with Europeans and acquired Western education and skills before other Nigerians has a direct bearing on political and economic behavior and ethnic relations in Nigeria today. Epstein's introductory section points to the rapid maturation of anthropo- logical inquiry in contemporary Afri- can urbanization since the days of Gluckman's stimulating concepts not so very long ago. We have reached a stage where it is realistic to call for the application of "sharper and more varied conceptual tools" (p. 275). Sharper and more varied conceptual tools will increase our methodological sophistication and aid us with par- ticular research problems; but I do not believe they will be of much utility in answering the question of what Afri- can urbanization basically is. For this question we need a single conceptual framework, as Epstein points out (p. 276), and, I would add, one that is at a high level of generalization. Such a framework should not only handle diversity within Africa; it should also have universal applicability. We can- not begin to develop such a framework without employing some concept of modernization as an integral aspect of analysis. Modernization may well turn out to be more profitable a focus for analysis than urbanization per se. For example, it helps us to recognize the far greater resemblance in social institutions and in the "way of life" between a town of 5,000 and a city of 500,000 in America today than be- tween a traditional Yoruba city of over 100,000 and a modern town of 50,000 on the Nigerian Plateau. These latter are examples of very different species. The traditional Yoruba city (cf. Bascom 1955, 1958, 1962) is an overgrown town, representing a special response to historical conditions in Yorubaland during the 18th and 19th centuries. It makes fio sense to conceive of the traditional Yoruba city in a framework that include, modern towns of comparable size. Epstein mentions "degree of urban- ization"; I would like to know whai it is we should be measuring. Othei disciplines may stress quantitative indexes of urbanization, but anthro- pology has the special task of dealing with those qualitative aspects thai appear to be the necessary concomi- tants of the high degree of population size and density that mark urbar settlements. Furthermore, we must alsc attempt to understand urbanization a: a phenomenon associated with a widet social system that has, as Epsteir points out, demographic, social struc- tural, and cultural aspects (p. 276). The single conceptual framework should be, I think, the wider social system, which may be pre-industrial or, as is the case today in Africa. developing modern industrial in nature The framework must also include the evolution of that system. Epstein should have defined for w what is meant by Mitchell's "demo- graphic imperative" (p. 277), since it is one of three factors mentioned as im- portant for the analysis of urbaniza- tion and the development of urban social relations, and since the reference cited (Mitchell 1959) is unpublished. The concept of the stabilization of African urban populations and, related to this, the question of the extent to which Africans are develop- ing a commitment to an urban way of life have long been theoretical prob- lems. Mayer (1961) addressed himself to the latter problem specifically, and Mitchell reflects this concern in his work on lengths of urban residence. Implicit in these inquiries, I think, is the assumption that the development of an urban way of life, from a socio- logical perspective, depends on a basic transformation of personal attitude- that so long as African town residents conceive of themselves as committed to returning to their rural homes, the complete development of urban social systems is somehow inhibited. If my view is correct, then this assumption should be made explicit; and if there is a direct relationship between at- titudes of temporary urban residence and the kind of social life developing in the cities, then Epstein should have dealt more extensively with the im- plications of the circulation of labor migration and the degree to which there is a commitment to live in the rural homelands. It is now quite clear that while many tribesmen may consider themselves as migrants, only temporary urban residents, their actual condition is that of permanent town-dwellers (cf. Pons 1956:669, Plotnicov 1965, 1967:Chap. IX). Even target workers may find their urban sojourn prolonged because they are unable to return home with money as quickly as they initially intended (Sofer and Sofer 1955:603-04). Despite professed rural orientations, people r-emain in the cities, and they do some- thing about making their urban exist- ence more secure and more satisfying. Precisely what they do about it is represented by the developing urban systems. As I have tried to show elsewhere (Plotnicov 1967), individuals may disclaim a commitment to permanent urban residence while at the same time participating in the building of (from their point of view) enduring urban social institutions. This discussion is intimately related to two important problem areas raised by Epstein: urban-rural communica- tions and the extent to which (and under what conditions) traditional systems are perpetuated and perhaps even strengthened. The persistence of the traditional appears to us, as Ep- stein aptly calls it, a paradox (cf. Van Velsen 1960). The author has provided some notable situations (Sansom 1965; Mayer 1961) in which commitments to traditional systems are total. We should also examine the more numerous instances of partial retentions. For example, during recent years there has been an efflorescence of traditional title-taking among urban Ibo, and they are hardly unique among south- ern Nigerians who seek traditional offices and titles as if thereby to validate high status achieved in a modern social context. In addition to the rejuvenation of traditional values and parts of cultural systems, we com- monly find the kinship institutions of traditional social systems remaining strong while other aspects decline. Family members continue to offer each other loyalty and support, manifesting these in behaviors appropriate to the modern context, in spite of the fact that they may be dispersed among several cities and the family rural base. I view this manifestation of family solidarity as both a possible and necessary result of conditions of modernization. Modern communica- tions systems (post, road, rail) have developed to a point where easy contact (in the transmission of persons, messages, and money) is now the norm for most places in West Africa, thus making it possible for traditional kin- ship structures to remain viable. Also, the kinship group continues to perform traditional support and aid functions because modern welfare institutions have not yet developed sufficiently to meet town-dwellers' needs (Plotnicov 1966). Further anthropological in- vestigation will uncover many such paradoxes and increase our knowledge of those we are already aware of. Vol. 8 . No. 4 . October 1967 289</page><page sequence="16">Epstein's remarks on another o: these paradoxes, "tribalism" in the cities, are instructive and help cleai a murky area. He is quite right in pointing out that groups which comc under the general rubric of tribal as- sociations can have very different forms of organization, goals, and functions. The variations among sucb groups represent, as Epstein says, dif- ferent phases in the process of urban- ization, as well as the relations of members of ethnic groups to other types of associations "and to the over- all status system that has developed within the community." These aspects are well illustrated in the case of the Opobo Town Ijaw who, although highly sophisticated in Western education and holding elite occupa- tions, have come to manifest elements of nativism in their tribal association as a response to the perceived threat that other, more numerous, ethnic groups will usurp their favorable position (Plotnicov 1964). I am not sure what Epstein means by his fourth type of tribal association (p. 281), that which "approximates more to the type of exclusive social club." All such groups that I am aware of are not based in tribalism, but, on the contrary, are self-consciously anti- parochial, recruiting members on a basis of common interest and a com- mon lifestyle rather than ethnic origin. These groups are modern elite or in- cipient modern elite who energetically pursue policies of national integration. Epstein's hypothesis that it is "in the ports and great commercial centres rather than around the mines that variegated interest groups may be ex- pected to emerge and political associa- tions and trade unions to develop and flourish" (p. 277) has much promise. His argument is plausible, and the data, while few, are supportive. The hypothesis certainly merits testing and can be applied to various mono- industry settlements. Epstein spells out the social and political implications of this type of settlement convincingly (pp. 278-79), and the comparison he suggests of West African towns built around extractive industries with Cop- perbelt mining areas would be useful; but I question his choice of Enugu in eastern Nigeria as a possible unit for comparison. Enugu is the capital of the Eastern Region, and coal-mining has been declining in importance while varied commercial enterprises and communications activities have been expanding. Jos, in northern Nigeria, like Enugu, initially developed from mining activity (tin ore), but it too presents problems for comparison because of a diversity of economic and administrative activities. Some of the very recently developed mining areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia may well be the only places in West Africa suit- F able for comparison with the Copper belt. Epstein calls our attention to th important problem of determining "tc what extent the growth of towns give- rise to a system of cross-cutting tie, and allegiances" (p. 282). He suggest that in the Copperbelt municipal allegiances are developing, but I wonder how, given the transiency o: the urban populations there, this car be anything but superficial. Non- traditional, non-parochial ties hav( developed in the urban area of my firsthand experience (JoE) between status peers, co-religionists, and neigh- bors, but a loyalty to one's urban location can hardly be said to exist. Where the author speaks of the effects of colonial racial segregation in the new towns and cities (p. 277), his discussion might have more clear- ly distinguished the effects of black- white social and political relations from other aspects that have analytical- ly different dimensions. For example, he says that the effect of a segregated residential pattern has been "to ex- clude the [African] residents from full participation in the life of the town and the enjoyment of its amenities." In complex social systems, no one enjoys full participation, and with in- dependence achieved African town residents will continue to suffer amenity deprivations based on economic and class distinctions. I am particularly pleased to note Epstein's use of indigenous authors of fiction (e.g., Ekwensi), which I think may be employed more extensively in the future, obviously not as sources of empirical data, but as sources of in- sight into modern African social life as communicated by censitive and articulate insiders. Epstein's paper is a good contribu- tion to modern urban African studies, for it presents many stimulating ideas and hypotheses that merit close atten- tion for their promise. Because the paper is so vast an undertaking, containing so many germinal thoughts in a brief space, I often wished that the author might pause, delve more deeply, and further develop some of his ideas. He should be congratulated for this attempt to deal with an extremely complex and challenging area. by W. B. SCHWAB* Philadelphia, Pa., U.S.A. 10 x 66 Possibly the most severe problem facing anthropologists studying towns in Africa has been the absence of a pertinent and systematic theoretical framework within which one could formulate questions and assess find- ings. In many ways this is a unique situation. Anthropologists studying re- ligion, kinshin. p,olitical systems. etc.. have, despite many differences in out- look, a common frame of reference; but none of us seems to be very clear about what we mean by urbanism or urbanization. Approaches based on demographic criteria, social surveys, or the writings of American sociolo- gists, depending as they do on Western models, are inadequate and sometimes misleading in dealing with the towns of Africa. There is a need for a long, hard look at African towns in terms of the empirical data that are available. One starting point that has been sug- gested (Balandier 1956; Southall 1961; Schwab 1965) is an analysis of town life in terms of the differences beween towns. Epstein, by focusing on the variations in social and economic determinants of African towns, has taken an important step in this direc- tion. He has, moreover, made an ad- mirable effort to bring together ex- tremely diverse materials from many parts of the continent. Whether or not he has provided a general framework which is appropriate for the study of urbanization in Africa is a further question. It is difficult to know just what it is that Epstein means by "urbaniza- tion." We are told that it is not in- dustrialization, Westernization, the growth of settler communities, etc.; that it involves movement and change; and that its essence is the possibility of some discontinuity with some pre- existing set of conditions. It is difficult to assess these statements, because it is not clear what kind of change, or what kind of movement, is critical. There are many kinds of changes in the life of any individual; we must select certain sets of changes in behavior or values which are pertinent to urbanization. If the movement in question is physical movement from rural to urban areas, then migration becomes a necessary part of urbaniza- tion. Further, it appears to me that the disc7ontinuities have been over- stressed in the study of urbanization in Africa and that continuity, whether in terms of values, social relationships, or roles, is equally essential. The imposition of migrancy and discon- tinuity on urbanization produces cer- tain contradictions and inconsistencies. Thus, according to these restrictions, those of us who have lived all of our lives in American cities are not urbanized, and, more to the point, neither is any African born and reared in town. To be sure, people born and reared in town may have become urbanized as part of their early socialization process, but they have made adjustments and adapta- tions to certain sets of town conditions and have learned to solve their prob- lems within an urban frame of refer- ence.

This conclusion, I think, is based upon the fact that neither migration nor cultural discontinuity are important factors in Yoruba towns. I am not certain that the Yoruba way of life is urban (see Schwab 1965); but if it is, then Yoruba townsmen somehow, somewhere, have been through a process of urbanization. In discussing the physical environ- ment of towns, Epstein has raised some interesting points and has shown that physical limitations and restric- tions have broad implications for the social relationships of the Africans. This is, as he points out, very evident in the towns of Central and Southern Africa. However, I think he misses a point when he states that, "In the countries of West Africa, physical segregation was not built into the legal code, but the social pattern has often been broadly similar." The differences between West and Central and South- ern Africa are much more than legal. In West African towns there has been spatial differentiation based on ethnic differences, cultural antagonisms, or social or economic stratification; but it is not equivalent to the physical segregation in Central and Southern Africa, which is a reflection of a pervasive and rigid class and racial system. The question of the structural determinants of urban social systems is an extremely important one. When Africans come to town they meet certain sets of conditions, varying from place to place, with which they must come to terms if they are to remain in town. Housing conditions, influx policies, access to economic opportunities, and the like are part of a particular urban matrix. Certain re- lationships are clearly derived from these determinants. For example, the viability of the extended family unit within a town is directly related to housing policy. However, I think that the correlations suggested by Epstein between structural determinants and broader aspects of behavior are un- warranted. For example, we read that people tend to develop a more "in- dependent outlook" (whatever that may be) in commercial towns than in the more structured, paternalistic mining communities. People's attitudes, their adaptability, their creativity, and their independence are determined by many complex and interrelated social, economic, and psychological factors, and it seems to me that we need a lot more empirical data to draw such a conclusion. Associational life is another factor which Epstein relates, separately, t( both civic and industrial determinants He concludes first that associationa life is more likely to develop in comr mercial centers than in mining towns The facts that we have thus fai indicate that associations flourish ir the commercial centers of West AfricC and have little significance in th commercial centers of Central Africa If these data are correct, then the in- dustrial structure of a community by itself is not the primary factor ir associational life. Other factors (e.g. age, the strength of kin ties, religion. occupation, cultural background, etc.) may together or separately have as much or more influence in determin- ing participation in assoclations. Dawson's (1964) analysis of the as- sociational participation of the Mende and Temne in Free Town supports this view. The data he presents suggest very clearly that, within this one urban environment, association participation depends largely on cul- tural antecedents. Epstein himself alludes to the differential participa- tion in associations in the latter part of his paper. I am confused by Epstein's analysis of the relationship between tribal as- sociations and civic structures. He seems to be saying that associations tend to develop when there are no tribal elders in the formal administra- tive framework or no indigenous urban courts (as in Dar-es-Salaam and West Africa); and, conversely, that asso- ciations are absent where (as on the Copperbelt) there is indigenous urban and tribal leadership. If these are his points, I am in complete disagreement. To begin with, among the Yoruba, for example, there were urban courts, a highly developed indigenous leader- ship, and many associations. In Free Town, certainly, as he notes, there were associations together with an acknowledged and developed indig- enous leadership. In fact, this was generally the situation, as far as I know, throughout West Africa. Further, in Gwelo, Rhodesia, there were no indigenous leaders, no tradi- tional urban courts, and few associa- tions. It seems to me that the primary difficulty with Epstein's approach is his failure to take into account the differential response of people to any particular set of urban conditions. Although he refers to it on occasion throughout the paper, he has not come to terms with the fact that in any given urban environment there may be many intervening variables deter- mining the impact of town life and the adaptations made to it. An urban environment is a datum imposed upon a townsman, but his adjustments and nis assessments are nis uwn, anu an understanding of what is happening in towns must take this consideration into account. Epstein has chosen to limit his dis- cussion of the social structure of the town to tribalism and tribal associ- ations. He accepts the views of Mitchell and Wallerstein and dif- ferentiates between urban and rural tribalism. He argues that tribalism in the urban community is one of the major factors regulating relationships between townsmen, and that most frequently a man tends to limit his relationships, where he has choice, to fellow tribesmen. While this is important for understanding urban behavior, an equally important con- sideration is the fact that tribalism may be breaking down in town. For example, my data from Gwelo (Schwab n.d.) indicate that about 1/4 of the marriages in Gwelo are tribal- ly mixed. Marriage is one of the most important indices of social evaluation in any society. Mixed marriages are a strong indication that traditional tribal loyalties are being put aside, at least by some of the people, for new values and standards which do not include tribal affiliation as a basic criterion. Hellmann (1956) has made a similar point about South African towns. I do not understand Epstein's ap- parent quarrel with Little's inter- pretation of the adaptive role of as- sociations in West African towns. Epstein argues that the vast majority of recent immigrants to town are not "joiners." This appears to be a valid assessment for Central Africa but certainly is not for West Africa. There, all evidence indicates that as- sociations are very important in facilitating the adjustment of new migrants to town and that they perform varied and important functions for many segments of the population. This interpretation, from my point of view, does not cloud sociological issues. On the contrary, it clarifies them. There is still room for the other analyses that Epstein suggests. Finally, I do not agree that cama- raderie, ebullience, and gusto are characteristics common to all African towns. It is my impression that in many Rhodesian towns, for example, passivity, repression, and lack of gusto are the most striking characteristics of these African people. Perhaps it would be best if we did not stereotype African town-dwellers in any way. by WILLIAM A. SHACK* Chicago, Ill., U.S.A. 10 x 66 Epstein's paper is important not only inz that it calls attention to teoe Vol. 8 . No. 4 . October 1967 291</page><page sequence="18">simplified view frequently apparent in studies of urbanization and social change in Africa, but also in that it stresses the need to develop new con- ceptual tools for understanding both the forms and variations in patterns of African urbanization. This need increases as demographic and socio- logical data from urban centers in Liberia and Ethiopia, heretofore neglected by social anthropologists, are reported. In contrast to Epstein's general demographic picture of African towns (p. 279), a striking feature of the urban population of Addis Ababa, capital of Ethiopia, is the marked excess of females over males within the age groups 15 to 49; the over-all sex ratio is 90/100 (Social Survey 1960:63). This data suggests that Southall's (1961:6) Type A category of African towns-the old, establish- ed, and slowly growing-could be further refined to account for urban -enters like Addis Ababa, which lack significant industrialization or wage- Labor markets. The relative scarcity of skilled or semi-skilled employment Dpportunities for men, as against such wage-earning activities for women as domestic service, beer-selling, and zven prostitution, gives rise to an zxcess of females over males in non- industrial African cities. My own evidence from Addis Ababa would support Epstein's contention that urban tribal associations are to be understood in terms of the over-all ;tatus system within the community. Moreover, I would suggest that 'self-help" associations among urban Gurage tribesmen in Addis Ababa 'and no doubt among other townsmen is well), whose aims are directed primarily toward improving the welfare of kinsmen in the hinterland, zxpress two interrelated aspects of arban tribalism: (1) a degree of social and psychological detachment from .he urban community within which mnaximum sociocultural integration is yet to be attained; and (2) an idealiza- -ion of the social and economic ;ecurity that most urban tribesmen -ndeavor to achieve (Shack 1966). Westernization, or "Europeaniza- -ion," as a model denoting processes Df change in urban Africa must be re-examined in the light of developing aational cultural systems in newly in- lependent African states. Where a )articular tribal (or ethnic) group is lominant in the national system, the )ver-all process of change is very )ften shaped by that group's own ,olitical-cultural model; the Americo- Liberian and Amhara national cul- :ural svstems in Liberia and Ethiopia, respectively, are two cases in point. New conceptual formulations of social -hange in Africa might profitably take account of the long-established patterns of urbanization in the old .ndependent African states. Reply by A. L. EPSTEIN* I should like to thank all those who kindly offered comment on and criti- cism of my article. Since I regard the paper as a contribution to a discussion which is likely to continue, I do not feel it necessary to defend the argu- ment at every point and will therefore reply fairly briefly. Since a number of comments touch on the scope of the paper, in terms of its theoretical perspective as well as its coverage of particular topics, I think I ought to begin by noting some of its self-imposed limitations. Firstly, in preparing the article I was acutely aware that a number of analyses with broadly similar aims had appeared over the past few years. In these circumstances it seemed to me unnecessary to retrace ground that had already been well covered by my colleagues, save where this was im- portant for the development of my argument. Hence, for example, to take one of Plotnicov's points, I did not spell out the notion of the "demographic imperative" because, as Miner rightly observes, the matter has already been treated extensively by Mitchell and others. Secondly, as I pointed out in my first footnote, the paper in its original form was shaped to fit into a more general discussion of political development. In revising it, I decided to allow the original bias to remain as providing a convenient peg on which to hang the argument. (I find it interesting that this aspect of the paper evoked so little comment.) This explains the failure, referred to by Little and others, to deal with such topics as kinship and marriage, re- ligious movements and cults, and other features of the urban scene. The paper was not intended as a definitive treat- ment of the subject, but as a skeletal outline of an approach to it with illustrations of particular points. Some doubts have been raised about the value of the framework suggested. Indeed, Gutkind takes the view that we still do not know enough to be in position to develop such a framework, and argues that our approach to the study of urban systems should be more eclectic. There can be few phenomena of any degree of complexity that do not throw up problems of concern to different disciplines; and urbanization is no exception. I would be very surprised if an economist or an urban geographer were to cast his inquiries and subsequent data into the same kind of mould as I would, since each discipline is likely to be concerned with different sets of interconnexions or regularities. The question is what the distinctive contribution of the social anthropologist is or should be. The way in which the anthropologist conceptualizes the process of urban- ization is likely to have been consider- ably influenced by the situation in which he conducted his own field- research. Because of the way research is organized, and the heavy personal investment it involves, few are able to work in more than one area. The result is a tendency towards a kind of regional divide. When we read the reports of our colleagues who have worked in areas other than our own, we are often uncertain how far they are describing different situations, how far the differences are really the expression of alternative modes of approach. The aim in formulating a single framework is not to reduce everything to a common denominator, but to obviate this difficulty and to provide the means whereby the re- lations between variables can be examined in a number of different combinations and hypotheses put forward to be tested by further re- search. The basic concern of this approach is with the examination of systems of social relationship in towns, and it therefore seems sound sense to focus analytical attention on the towns themselves Here, as Bruner observes, I follow the line of attack advocated by Gluckman; but I do not, as he claims, see "urbanization processes as a function of factors intrinsic to the city itself." In the first place, I thought I had made it clear that the kind of urban growth with which I was concerned was a product of colo- nialism. Secondly, while it might appear as though I treat the variables of industrial structure, civic structure, and demographic structure as purely intrinsic, it is plain that they may also be regarded as external factors. Where one places the stress is a question of analytical context. (Incidentally, since Miner raises the point about the history of ideas, I should note that I attempt- ed to formulate a framework along these lines in a paper written in 1959 [published in 1961] in which I used the expression "environmental con- stants." The term "environment" here is a relative concept: its bounds are not 292 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="19">Epstein: URBANIZATION AND SOCIAL CHANGE IN AFRICA set, but vary according to the social units isolated for purposes of analysis [Epstein 1961:42]. Thus factors which for one purpose may be regarded as external may for another purpose or in a different context be regarded as internal.) The main point I wanted to make was that the social structure of the town is a product of the complex interplay of a number of factors, some of them located within the town, some of them outside it (hence the discussion of rural-urban relations in the latter part of the paper). I would therefore certainly accept Bruner's comment about the importance of the region. Bruner and Schwab argue that I have placed too much emphasis on discontinuity in the definition of urbanization. This criticism seems to me to rest on a misconception. In my view, urbanization refers to a social process involving people in social re- lationships within a new kind of physical environment. It is in this sense that I speak of urbanization as requir- ing departure from some pre-existing set of conditions. I would have thought that the case of a child growing up in an American city was adequately covered by speaking of his being socialized or enculturated to an urban way of life. Would Schwab speak of an African child growing!up in the tribal or rural areas of Africa as being "tribalized" or "ruralized"? The more important point, however, is that to place the initial stress on discontinuity is not to deny the im- portance of continuity. Discontinuity rarely involves a complete break with the past, but varies along a continuum. This was noted many years ago by Godfrey Wilson when he showed how grants of five-acre plots to Africans in Broken Hill affected their adjust- ment to life in the town and in some contexts produced a different response from that of Africans on the Copper- belt. The degree of discontinuity present in any given situation is to be established empirically and its further implications traced out. My discussion of industrial and civic structure was evidently not as clear as I had hoped. Miner is of course quite correct when he points out that administration has political as well as economic functions. My aim, however, was to separate out these functions so that given, for example, the economic character of the town, we could go on to make inferences about other aspects of the urban system. In the same way, one could, I would have thought, speak of the "industrial structure" of a Univer- sity town; certainly, in a sociological study one would presumably want to do more than treat it simply in terms of its educational functions. But I can perhaps make my position clearer here if I take up one of Schwab's comments about the relationship between associational life and the in- dustrial or civic structure. Schwab ascribes to me the view that the industrial structure is the primary factor in the development of voluntary association. This is not my contention. I am not seeking to establish simple one-to-one correlations. What I sug- gested in the paper was that when confronted with a problem of the kind specified by Schwab, we should look first at the civic institutions to see what provision is made for han- dling those difficulties that people are likely to encounter when they move into the towns. For example, where coffins are provided by the local authority (as they once were in the Copperbelt), there is clearly less need for a burial society. As Schwab him- self observes later, an urban environ- ment is a datum imposed upon the townsman. My major concern has been to break up this environment into a number of variables so that we may examine what each entails and in this way discover problems for further in- quiry. For example, provision has sometimes been made within the civic structure for the setting up of urban courts. In Gwelo, where Schwab worked, there were no such courts. What implications follow from this? How were disputes handled in Gwelo? Did they all go before a European magistrate, or had other informal mechanisms of adjudication been developed? Was the incidence of crimes of violence greater in Gwelo than in places where formal courts did exist? The framework I have proposed was designed not so much to provide a set of ready-made answers, but to suggest questions for further investi- gation and to advance the search for regularity in urban social life. It seems to me that Schwab contradicts himself when he argues that the towns- man's adjustments and assessments are his own but at the same time complains that my discussion of as- sociational life ignores the strength of kin ties, religion, occupation, and cul- tural background. For reasons already indicated, my discussion of urban social relationships was necessarily uneven. Hence in deal- ing with categorical relationships I said little about stratification but con- centrated on tribalism. In regard to the latter Schwab appears to attribute to me the view that we are dealing with unchanging categories and with pro- cesses that operate uniformly through- out urban Africa. I subscribe to no such view. More than a decade ago Southall (1956b:580) indicated that the accurate assessment of what tribalism counts for was a fundamental require- ment of urban studies in Africa. Here questions obviously arise as to the particular expression ethnicity takes in different urban communities (one of Mayer's comments and Horowitz's reference to landsmannschaft are very relevant here) and the forces that maintain it or lead to its decline. If the high proportion of tribally mixed marriages may be taken as an indica- tion of the breaking down of tribalism in Gwelo, as Schwab maintains, I would find in this situation not a point to be contended, but a problem I hope Schwab will go on to analyze. To what extent are these mixed marriages inter-tribal marriages (using "tribe" in the narrow sense), and to what extent are they intra-ethnic group or intra-district marriages (see Mitchell 1957)? And if significant differences do emerge between the pattern in Gwelo and that reported elsewhere, how do these relate to other aspects of Gwelo's social system? Is it possible, for example, that in Rhodesia, with its major division between Ndebele- and Shona-speaking groups, region or district is more relevant to the definition of categori- cal relationships than is ethnic group or tribe? It is, incidentally, in ad- dressing ourselves to problems of this kind that the value of repeating a study at regular intervals, advocated by a number of people, becomes most apparent, since changes for example in the patterns of marriage can then be directly measured. Plotnicov raises a question in this context about the "tribal" basis of certain exclusive social clubs. Plot- nicov is probably correct that most clubs of this type are self-consciously parochial, recruiting their membership amongst the modern elite. What I had in mind was the situation referred to by Leslie in his account of Dar-es- Salaam. It appears in some cases that, for historical reasons, a particular group may receive a headstart over other groups in matters of education. When members of the group are posted to "elite" jobs in areas where they are a "stranger" minority, they may form their own exclusive social club. Plotnicov makes a number of other comments with which I am in sub- stantial agreement. He questions my choice of Enugu as a possible unit for comparison with the mining towns of the Copperbelt. I would defer to his judgment on this; my suggestion per- iaps illustrates that regional divide to which I referred earlier. However, we io at least agree on the main point it issue: the need for comparative ;tudies of this kind where at least ,ome of the variables can be held con- tant. I agree too with his observation hat no one enjoys full participation n the social life of a town, and that Vol. 8 . No. 4 . October 1967 293</page><page sequence="20">what he calls amenity deprivatiom rest on bases other than residential segregation. The passage in question was redrafted before I received Plotni- cov's comment, and I hope the analogy I have drawn between African loca- tion and Western city slum may go some way to meeting his point and a similar one raised by Schwab. One final comment: Bruner says I state that Gluckman treats all towns as if they were alike. If I had said this, it would seem to me a gross mis- representation of Gluckman's position. What Gluckman was arguing, when he first addressed himself to the question of urbanization, was that African towns should be regarded sociologically as being of the same order as towns elsewhere; the focus of comparison was on towns and not the contrast between town and country. This is very different from treating all towns as though they were alike. Gluckman's formulations have provid- ed the starting point for my own and Dthers' work, but where his most recent discussions seem to stress the study of what is common in urban development, it seems to me that we must now also address ourselves to the question of variation in urban social ,ystems. By laying equal stress on both these aspects we may hope to advance towards a more complete theory of irbanization in Africa and elsewhere. References Cited ALMOND, G., and J. S. COLEmAN.
