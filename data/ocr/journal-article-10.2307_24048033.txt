For my purpose, this comprises sequential analysis, interactive aspects and a particular interest in the methods used by the participants in describing illness. I will concentrate on the activities speakers engage in during the process of discourse production. In particular, I am interested in those 'formulating' activities (cf. Gülich and Kotschi, 1995) which seem to be specific to knowledge transfer, i.e. reformula tion and illustration. These procedures contribute significantly to the constitu tion of explanation sequences2 used by experts in their attempts to present complex information in a comprehensible manner. Following earlier research, I (like Ciapuscio, in this issue) start from the prem ise that formulating activities in oral communication can be described as a kind of 'work' and their success as an 'interactional achievement' on the part of the participants (Schegloff, 1982). In task-oriented communication such as knowl edge transfer between experts and non-experts, the participants are likely to come up against numerous obstacles. In order to solve these problems they resort to procedures which can be described in terms of conversation analysis. The repertoire of linguistic techniques used by experts to convey scientific or technical knowledge to non-experts is extremely varied. It includes the explana tion of specialist terms, reformulation and a variety of ways in which complex statements can be structured. I am going to focus on procedures of illustration, a group of procedures which are particularly striking in the corpus I have taken as a basis for study. Illustration procedures often go hand-in-hand with reformula tion procedures, but they can also occur independently. It is therefore legitimate to describe them as a special type of formulating activity. Reformulation and illustration procedures are both also dealt with in Ciapuscio's contribution, but the two articles focus on different things: while Ciapuscio is mainly concerned with reformulation, I will concentrate on illustra tion. In both articles there is, however, an attempt to see the two techniques as interrelated. Unlike a great deal of research on expert/non-expert communica tion, most of which is based on written materials, both Ciapuscio's and my own article are the result of the study of oral communication. They both focus on for mulation as a process rather than on the text as a finished product and they both analyse direct, i.e. face-to-face communication between experts and non-experts. From a content point of view, however, the two studies cover totally different ground: while I am interested in how medical experts convey illness-related information to non-experts (or vice versa, see section 4), Ciapuscio investigates certain intermediate stages in the process of knowledge transfer; her material consists of private interviews with experts, carried out to help create popular versions of medical or other scientific texts. I will now give a brief outline of the theoretical approach adopted (section 2). The analysis will then proceed in two steps: to start with, the emphasis will be on techniques employed by the 'experts', i.e. doctors and therapists (section 3); in a second step I will concentrate on utterances by 'non-experts', i.e. patients (sec tion 4). This will be followed by an examination of the question how the roles of</page><page sequence="3">Gülich: Conversational techniques used in transferring knowledge 237 expert and non-expert are constituted or 'constructed' in and by interaction (section 5). 2. Formulating activities: procedures of reformulation and illustration The approach to reformulation used here was developed by Gülich and Kotschi (cf. Gülich and Kotschi, 1995, 1996). The main assumption is that discourse production is a type of work which leaves traces in speakers' utterances and that it is these traces which are directly observable and accessible to linguistic analy sis. We distinguish three types of traces referring to three different kinds of dis course production activities: (1) verbalization procedures, i.e. the fundamental activity of verbalizing cognitive content; (2) treatment procedures: and (3) quali fication procedures; types (2) and (3) refer to already verbalized expressions. We speak of treatment procedures when a speaker refers back to an earlier segment of talk, produced by himself or another interlocutor, with a new expression; he 'works on it' or 'treats it' in some way. By qualification procedures we mean eval uation and commenting procedures on a meta-discursive level. Reformulations are typical treatment procedures with a three-part structure consisting of a reference expression, a marker and a treating expression. The speaker's activity consists of retrospectively characterizing an expression pro duced earlier on as insufficient or unsatisfactory and therefore merely prelimi nary: he suggests an alternative. This activity is indicated by a (verbal or prosodie) marker. The following example, taken from a seminar in which a sports therapist talks about the benefits of sport to patients at a heart clinic, shows how reformulation procedures can be used to explain the relatively complex processes of metabo lism. Example (1) Fettstoffwechsel (Metabolism)3 1 die muskelzelle is mit abstand das beste recycle organ was die welt überhaupt kennt, Muscle cells are the world's greatest recyclers by far. 2 die muskelzelle verbrennt in der tat alles'... und baut DAraus auch alles auf, They do indeed burn up anything and then create something new from what has been burnt. 3 zum beispiel isses so'.

That is where you get this protective effect - 11 und die entsteht durch die Verbrennungsprozesse, it's the result of the burning-up processes. 12 das heisst also die muskelzelle is wirklich so die verbrennt in der tat ALLES'.. So muscle cells really are like that - they do indeed burn up everything 13 was die hormone und so im blut schon gespaltn haben that hormones etcetera have broken down in the blood - 14 und AUS diesem abbauprodukt das EINzige was rausgeht is C02'.. und wasser and the only thing that is lost from this waste product is CO,- and water 15 das was wer ausschwitzen (leise) oder so, + das is das EINzige was rausgeht,. which we lose through perspiration (softly) and so on - that is the only thing we lose 16 der rest bleibt ALLES verwertbar im körper,.. everything else is retained and can be re-used by the body. 17 und mit sport' mit körperlicher Betätigung . Sport and physical activity of any kind 18 fördern wir praktisch sämtliche Verbrennungsprozesse, encourage virtually all burning-up processes. In this passage the initial statement that muscle cells are the world's greatest recy clers by far is the point of reference for several different reformulations. The first example occurs in a colloquial paraphrase: They do indeed burn up anything and then create something new from what has been burnt. The phrase in der tat ( they do indeed...) can be regarded as a reformulation indicator. In lines 5-7 this is fol lowed by a technical paraphrase: when triglycerides are broken down into free fatty acids, which are burnt, and glycerin, which the liver re-synthesizes into HDL. In line 12 the first reformulation (cf. 1. 2 above) is rephrased once more, or rather, it is repeated almost literally. The indefinite term alles (anything) is now defined more closely by a relative clause (that hormones etcetera have broken down in the blood). The reformulation process is signalled by a typical reformulation marker: das heisst also (so)Iwhat this means is ...) and then even reinforced by is wirklich so (really are like that). This is followed by yet another reformulation, which refers to the idea of re-usability, in other words it goes back to the recycling properties of muscle cells. Embedded in this reformulation structure is another reformulation, which refers to the beneficial influence of sport on the building-up of HDL levels (II. 3-4,11. 8-9,11.17-18). The reference expression of this reformulation is followed by two treating expressions, the second of which links the embedded reformula tion to the main reformulation structure by returning to the concept of the burn ing-up process. A third reformulation, which is less complex than the two others, is embedded in the second treating expression: (11.17-18: Sport and physical activ ity of any kind encourage virtually all burning-up processes, where physical activity is a more general expression than sport). Table 1 will clarify this complex network of structures: The original expression (i.e. the reference expression) and its reformulation</page><page sequence="5">Gülich: Conversational techniques used in transferring knowledge 239 table 1.

(i.e. the treating expression) relate to each other in different ways; as a result, we can observe a number of different types of reformulation (cf. column 5 of Table 1). We have to distinguish between 'paraphrase' and 'repetition': where the origi nal expression and the reformulation are totally or largely identical, we use the term 'repetition' (cf. Gülich and Kotschi, 1995: 45-6): the third and the fifth example in Table 1 contain instances of this. The term 'paraphrase', however, covers cases where the reference expression and the treating expression differ to varying degrees. The reformulation can be no more than a variation, but it can also take the form of an expansion or a reduction (on these three types of para phrase, see Gülich and Kotschi, 1995: 46-7). In the context of knowledge transfer it is worth noting that there is frequent switching from colloquial to technical language and vice versa: our example con tains both colloquial and technical paraphrases. The procedure guarantees that medical knowledge is communicated in a style appropriate to non-experts. On the other hand, a minimum of technical language is indispensable since (a) it enables patients to identify familiar information in new contexts (for example, written materials): and (b) its use is an essential ingredient of what constitutes the role of an expert (see section 5).</page><page sequence="7">Gülich: Conversational techniques used in transferring knowledge 241 It is clear that in this passage reformulation is the central procedure.4 Interestingly, in this particular example the point of reference expression (and source of the various reformulation procedures) is itself metaphorical. The speaker thus combines reformulation with illustration, the other formulating procedure mentioned above. This is the area we now discuss. Like Ciapuscio I define illustration as being a procedure which can be used for primary verbalization. It differs from reformulation in that it need not be employed to rework what has already been verbalized. Admittedly, an illustration can function as a reformulation, but it can also (like the metaphor of the muscle cell as a recycler in Example (1)) be the starting-point for a (more abstract) refor mulation. Reformulation does not necessarily result in illustration. It is possible for a speaker (and the sports therapist quoted above would be a case in point) to approach his subject via some form of illustration right from the start: in our example he chooses to present a relatively abstract type of subject matter (the processes of metabolism) in the form of an illustration, i.e. the metaphor of the muscle cell as a recycler. In the following sections I propose to show what forms illustration can take and what functions it can fulfil.5 The examples have been taken from professional medical discourse (section 3) and patients' utterances (section 4). 3. Procedures of illustration used by medical experts Studies of communication between experts and non-experts have so far tended to focus on the use of metaphor.6 However, the analysis of corpora from oral, face to-face interaction makes it very clear that there are a number of other illustra tion procedures, which have not had the attention they deserve.7 Altogether four main types of illustration have so far been identified: 1 various forms of metaphorical language (metaphor in the narrow sense as well as comparison and analogy): 2 different kinds of exemplification, which allow the speaker to express complex medical concepts in terms of ordinary everyday experience; 3 'scenarios', i.e. the drawing up of possible situations, events or reactions (cf. Brünner, 1987); 4 other forms of concretization. Metaphorical language (metaphors, comparisons and analogies): this seems to be the most important type. To simplify matters, I will use the term 'metaphor' generically for all possible types of linguistic images. For a general definition of metaphor I follow Lakoff and Johnson (1980, 1999). According to them, 'the essence of metaphor is understanding and experiencing one kind in terms of another' (1980: 5). One of their most important observations is that metaphors rarely occur in isolation but that they have a tendency to form complete metaphorical systems, i.e. they are part of whole complexes of interrelated lin guistic expressions from a common metaphorical area. Such systems are part of</page><page sequence="8">242 Discourse Studies 5(2) human experience, for 'it is hard to think of a common subjective experience that is not conventionally conceptualized in terms of a metaphor' (Lakoff and Johnson, 1999: 45). From this point of view metaphors can be seen as determin ing our thought patterns and the way we conceptualize new experiences: 'a metaphor may play some significant role in structuring one's experience' (Lakoff and Johnson, 1999: 72). So metaphors are concepts. We use them to conceptual ize knowledge, experience and feelings, including medical knowledge and experi ence of illness.8 Such concepts are selective: a metaphor, or system of metaphors, will always highlight certain aspects while hiding others (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980: Chapter 3). Metaphorical systems are frequently illness-specific: to describe the function of the heart, the circulatory system and the illnesses involved, the image of the heart as an engine or the circulatory system seen as a traffic system can, for example, serve as central metaphorical systems. In German the heart is often described as an engine which drives life (Motor des Lebens)-, sometimes it runs at top speed (läuft auf Hochtouren), but to reduce strain on the heart, patients are told to change into neutral gear (den Gang rausnehmen) or to switch off (abschalten) (cf. Brünner, 1999). These are images which are familiar to everyone and therefore do not need to be substantiated further. Some metaphors have become specialist terms, such as the word bypass, which is based on the idea of a detour to alleviate traffic congestion. Another metaphorical system results from the personification of bodies or parts of bodies. This is the case, for example, when one speaks of the heart as liking activity, getting into trouble, fighting, stumbling, getting tired or similar expres sions. All these metaphors could be described as examples of anthropomorphism (cf. Lakoff and Johnson, 1980: Chapter 7). Example (2), taken from the same talk by a sports therapist explaining the function of metabolism to patients at a heart clinic as Example (1), shows how such procedures (including exemplification, scenarios and other forms of con cretization) can be used and how they can be combined to complement each other: Example (2) Fettstoffwechsel ( Metabolism) 1 so jetz. is die frage wie reagiert ABER äh .. der. zweite große positive äff/ as/ äh effekt well, now the question is the second big effect 2 über den fettstoffwechsel is folgender,.. nehm wer ma an es is montagnachmittag'.. sie on metabolism is the following - let's suppose it's Monday afternoon, 3 entscheiden sich jetz. ne halbe bis dreiviertel stunde entweder zu laufn zu schwimmen zu you decide to go running, swimming, hiking or cycling for half an hour 4 wandern oder radzufahren, oder aufm ergometer aufm heimtrainer zu sitzen.. äh ne or three quarters of an hour or sit on the home trainer for half an hour, 5 halbe stunde'. dann würde der fettstoffwechsel einigermaßen gut laufen, then your metabolism would work o.k. 6 .. so jetz hörn sie auf .. komm wieder nach hause So now you stop - get back home</page><page sequence="9">Gülich: Conversational techniques used in transferring knowledge 243 7 oder beziehungsweise beendn nach ner halben stunde das training' or rather finish your training after half an hour - 8 ... dann hört das aber hier nicht auf .. dann passiert nämlich folgendes . but that is not the end of it by any means - what happens next is 9 . die muskelzelle .. die sacht sich jetz folgendes,.. wenn der kerl morgen nochma läuft your muscle cell says to itself 'if he's going to run again tomorrow 10 [Lachen] fang ich jetz schon mal an . weiter triglyceride zu spaltn'.

The speaker first creates a 'scenario': he addresses his audience directly and sketches out a possible situation as well as a selection of alternative actions (cf. Brünner, 1987, 1999). The scenario is spread over several days and incorporates further procedures of illustration, mainly metaphors. These can be seen as instances of anthropomorphism; here they are used as the central illustration technique. The speaker describes the muscle cells as active, speaking entities and uses direct speech for their activities (11. 9-12, 28-29). This metaphorical form is used for the initial explanation of the physiological processes. This is followed by abstract rewording, the introduction of a specialist term (eine sogenannte NACHbrentterphase, 1. 13 -a so-called post-burning phase) in the form of a reformu lation (introduced by the marker das heisst, 1. 13 - that means). This is a typical procedure in communication between experts and non-experts. Embedded in the global structure of a scenario there are several minor refor mulations, for example, ne halbe stunde (11. 3 and 5) - for half an hour, and komm wieder nach hause oder beziehungsweise beendn nach ner halben stunde das training (1. 7)-get back home or rather finish your training after half an hour. Apart from metaphors and reformulations, this scenario comprises an exem plification, namely, a marathon runner, in order to illustrate how long this post burning phase takes (11. 20-23). So the excerpt shows a fairly complex interplay of different varying forms of illustration; a scenario provides the framework for the anthropomorphic representation of a muscle cell, on the one hand, and the example of the marathon runner, on the other. It is quite evident here not only that individual metaphors and examples are incorporated into a discourse of spe cialist content, but also that the medical procedures in general are conceptual ized in a way which determines the entire description. The scenario touches on the patients' everyday activities. The metaphors also have a connection to everyday life. This is true of the entire corpus and of all the illustration procedures used in this particular context. In media communication - and particularly in television programmes - highly sophisticated metaphors are frequently developed (cf. Brünner, 1999). In face-to-face communication, however, other methods tend to be preferred, namely exemplification, scenarios and simple concretization (cf. also Niederhauser, 1999, Chapter 10.6). By the term 'concretization' I mean procedures which consist of rewording abstract information in a non-abstract manner. An example of this can also be found in the text we have seen (1. 15; wenn sie also zwei stundn radfahrn... - if you go cycling for two hours). In this case cycling is not used as a metaphor, nor is it an example in the technical sense; it simply stands for any kind of physical activity (Je nachdem was sie getan haben - depending what you've been doing).</page><page sequence="11">Gülich: Conversational techniques used in transferring knowledge 245 Just how typical a procedure this is becomes even clearer in the following excerpt from a patients seminar, in which a cardiologist shows and explains a film of a bypass operation, at the same time answering the patients' questions. In answer to the question whether a patient can deposit reserves of his/her own blood prior to the operation, the doctor replies by pointing out the difficulties involved with storage and disposal of the blood: Example (3) Bypass 1 dieses . blut muß verwAL:tet und gelA:gert werden,. das ist nur gAnz kurzfristig this blood has to be stored and can only be kept for a very short time - 2 -haltbar,. das wird nlch so verarbeitet wie:'.. blut was man zum blUtspenden it's not handled like blood kept for transfusions 3 benutzt, sondern nU:r' für diese operation' behalten . und wird dann weggeworfen, it's only used for this operation, then it's thrown away and 4 es muß Entsorgt werden,... wir hatten hier grO:ße entsORgungsprobleme,. wenn has to be disposed of... we had big disposal problems here. When 5 wir blUt kommen lassen, das kAnn man nich einfach inn ,müll kippen'. von wegen, we order blood it can't just be thrown into the rubbish bin - no way! There is no doubt that can't just be thrown into the rubbish bin can be understood neither as a metaphor nor as an example; it is simply a concrete expression for the relatively abstract concept disposal problems. Such procedures of concrétisa tion make it much easier for patients to see the relevance of medical information to their everyday lives than does the use of complicated metaphors. The same speaker expresses herself in a similarly concrete way in the follow ing excerpt, using direct speech: Example (4) Bypass 1 sie können Alle' ihren operatiONsbericht, beim operateur' anfordern,.. wenn: er ihn you can all ask the operating surgeon for your medical report - if he 2 noch nlch' geschickt hat können sie ihn Anschreiben und sagen ich möchte gern meinen: hasn't already sent it you can write to him and say I'd like to have my medical report. 3 op-bericht'. kommt der irgendwann im nächsten halben jähr als durchschlag auf sie zu You'll get a copy some time in the next six months. The relatively unspecific expression ask the operating surgeon is reformulated in a sentence in which the patient addresses the surgeon directly: I'd like to have my medical report - even though the wording is a little too colloquial to be used in a corresponding letter. But this actually underlines the fact that the sentence is no more than an instance of illustration. Here the concretization also functions as a reformulation; in other words, the treating expression (I'd like to have my medical report) takes the form of a concretization; the two procedures overlap. This shows once again (compare the analysis of Example (1)) that rather than being alterna tives, reformulation and illustration procedures frequently operate together. The necessity of concrete reference to experience is a subject frequently dealt with by the experts themselves. Introductory remarks or comments such as You have to imagine it THIS way are often found, indicating that the speaker deliber</page><page sequence="12">246 Discourse Studies 5(2) ately uses illustration procedures as a resource of discourse production. Sometimes therapists ask patients explicitly to try to express their experience of the illness in terms of everyday activities and thus to apply any general medical information to their personal case. In conversation analysis such techniques are described as 'accountings' (cf. e.g. ten Have, 1999: 187-9). This is shown by Example (5). taken from the talk of a medical sociologist: Example (5) Streßbewältigung (Handling stress) 1 Eh . wir weiterguckn . äh . ja welche arten von'.. kombinationen . von Before we have a further look at what kinds of combinations of 2 umweltanforderungn . und verhaltensmustern environmental challenges and patterns of behaviour, 3 mit den entsprechenden gedanken with the corresponding thoughts 4 und gefühlen dahinter stehn könn . mach ich hier mal nen EINschnitt' and feelings, could be behind it, I'll stop here 5 ehm .. und guck.. ob and see if, 6 sie mit dem schema was Anfangn könn . the table is any use to you 7 (...) oder was SCHÖN wäre . wenn sie . (...) or what would be good, would be if 8 eigene erFAHrungen darauf beziehn könntn you could relate your own experience to it This example marks the transition to a new subject (environmental challenges and patterns of behaviour). After a lengthy passage offering fairly detailed discussion of stress-inducing factors, which are also listed in a diagram, the speaker makes a meta-discursive comment on the way she is structuring her talk. Before she actu ally does move on to the new subject, she tries to test comprehension: see if the table is any use to you; and she suggests the attempt to relate your own experience to it as an appropriate form of checking. At another point, the same therapist directly encourages a patient who has explained a problem using generalizing forms like you or the individual to give an illustration: Example (6) Streßbewältigung (Handling stress) 1 in dEm fall fand ichs gut wenn sie jetz ne situatlON schildern'. dann könn wir in this case I think it would be good if you could describe a situation - then we 2 eher drauf eingehn .. was: mit der situation . zu mAchn is could say more easily what to do in that situation Obviously the expert's idea is that patients who have absorbed and understood the medical information provided should be able to take advantage of it to improve their everyday lives. She therefore insists on the importance of concrete reference to patients' own experience. In her eyes the most important criterion by which the success of knowledge transfer should be judged is the degree to which a patient turns out to be able to relate general information to individual experience.</page><page sequence="13">Gülich: Conversational techniques used in transferring knowledge 247 Of course, there are varying individual preferences of experts in the choice of illustration techniques: one person chooses a metaphorical technique of illustra tion whereas another prefers examples or concretizations. This also became clear in interviews with experts conducted by students of Bielefeld University in the course of a seminar designed to establish how these experts communicate spe cialist knowledge to heart patients. For example, one of the people interviewed (the sports therapist from Examples (1) and (2)) commented on his choice of certain metaphors: Example (7) Interview Sporttherapeut (Sports therapist interview) 1 (EA) äh' was ich AUch als bildliche spräche benutze is: bei::. diesen stoffwechsel er - another thing I use as an illustration for these metabolism situations when the 2 Situationen:. wenn der von dem Einen auf die Andere stoffwechselstufe Umschaltet body switches over from one metabolic level to another 3 der körper, und es entsteht ein ENGpaß (EA) benutz ich immer die mEtapher mit dem and there's congestion, I always use the ski lift metaphor, 4 skilift,. also wenn plötzlich hundert leute aufn skilift kommn' und der skilift kann like when a hundred people suddenly get on a ski lift and the ski lift can 5 immer nur zwei transportlEREN' dann is der körper in der läge ein zweiten skilift only carry two - well, the body is able to build another ski lift 6 zu bauen . innerhalb von minuten nech' um die/ WEIterzutransportieren (EA) in just a matter of minutes, you know, to go on carrying them all. 7 also solche bILder versuch ich zu benutzen, (laut) ja ja+ irgendwie was im alitag I try to use images like that - yes, something from everyday life that 8 denen denen klAr is everybody can understand. The sports therapist's use of the ski lift image is a perfect example of metaphor based knowledge transfer. By contrast, the medical sociologist (MS), who gave us Examples (4) and (5), in reply to a corresponding question asked by the inter viewer (I), mainly emphasized the significance of a concrete relationship to the patients' own experiences: Example (8) Interview Medizinsoziologin (Medical sociologist interview) 1 I: und worauf achten sie dA damit die patienten da möglichst viel mitnehmn' I.:.. and what do you do to make sure the patients grasp as much as possible ... 2 MS: ja das auch nAhe an den erfahrungen anzusiedeln also auch auch nich zu wissenschaftlich MS: yes, close to their experience - not too technical, 3 obwohl ich da schon wissenschaftliche Studien zitier'(EA) although 1 do quote from some scientific studies 4 aber daß ich auch mehr meinen Umgang damit deutlich mache und beisch/ konkrete but I also make clear how I deal with them 5 BEIspiele bringe also s möglichst anschaulich mache, and I try to make it as plain as possible through concrete examples... 6 I: mm und ähm ja die anschaulichkeit entsteht durch die bEIspiele vornehmlich I: so you use examples, that's your main illustration technique 7 MS: ja: ja, (EA) und auch durch die art der spräche necht</page><page sequence="14">248 Discourse Studies 5(2) MS: that's right and through my way of speaking 8 ich . (EA) versuche nicht zu sehr Wissenschaftssprache zu benutzen I try not to use language which is too technical 9 I: mhm I The speaker makes a point of saying that in talking to patients she attaches par ticular importance to a certain technique of illustration: the use of concrete exam ples, which are close to their experience. This technique is contrasted with medical language which is over-technical. Whether metaphors or concrete examples are used as a method of knowledge transfer, both types have in common, in the corpus under investigation, that they link technical medical information to patients' everyday experience. There are two reasons why there is little point in trying to evaluate the various techniques in terms of their contribution to successful knowledge transfer: (a) they accentu ate different aspects of knowledge: and (b) they mark different experts' individual stylistic preferences. In the context of expert/non-expert communication this kind of stylistic variation deserves much more attention than it has had so far. 4. The 'expertise' of the non-experts For reasons of clarity of presentation I have until now concentrated exclusively on experts. If I left it at that, I would, however, not do justice to the fact that in the situations from which the examples quoted were taken the experts interact directly with non-experts - in this case, patients. Therefore the non-experts must also be included in this study. This is clear as soon as one looks at the reaction of the patients in the seminars in which experts and patients were both speaking. We were able to study what additional explanations the patients asked for or pro voked through comments and how they constructed illness-related knowledge in the course of the interaction. It is also interesting to see to what extent non-experts take up the techniques of illustration offered by the experts (such as images or examples) and what images or examples they themselves are likely to use. However, I will not go into that here (these aspects are developed in Brünner and Gülich, 2002) but limit myself to another aspect. From a conversation-analytical point of view, 'experts' and 'non-experts' are only relational terms. 'Expertise is neither a static construct residing outside of the concrete interactions of medical encounters, nor is it an owned construct belonging solely to physicians' (Barton, 1996: 303). Expertise is always bound to a particular context and to a recipient, i.e. it becomes relevant in this exact context because its relevance is determined by the participants and it only covers a particular field. By this I do not mean that a medical expert can be a non-expert in car mechanics or that a medical non-expert can be an expert in environmental mat ters, etc.: in medical communication, the so-called non-expert is an expert in at least one respect - his or her own illness (cf. Willems, 1992). This is so not only</page><page sequence="15">Giilich: Conversational techniques used in transferring knowledge 249 because he or she acquires illness-related knowledge and becomes a 'specialist' in dealing with his or her own chronic illness. The subjective side of this illness, experience with its development or, for example, how and to what degree pain is felt9 - these are things which are not accessible to the medical expert - only the person affected can transmit these things. In other words, certain aspects of a heart condition are best known to the patient suffering from it and it is only from the patient that the doctor can receive sufficient information (despite ECGs, ultra sonic scans and coronary angiograms). These can be aspects of illness-related knowledge such as becoming aware of angina pectoris or reaction to a particular medicine but they can also be aspects of more subjective experience. In the edito rial to 'Lay diagnosis' (Beach, 2001) Sarangi argues that, 'it is quite conceivable that when patients offer long narratives about their illnesses, these can be seen as harboring a set of diagnostic concerns' (2001: 4). This can be clearly shown in two excerpts from interviews in which patients describe their heart attacks: Example (9) Aus heiterem Himmel10 (Out of the blue) On being asked by the interviewer (=1) about a decision regarding a stay in a rehabilitation centre, the patient (=P) replies that his office was taking care of the matter. 1 I: (...) ach so die ham schon gesacht äh. hier I: (....) oh, so they said -er- this is 2 I: der sozialdienst bei der . bundespost.. I: the federal post office social service... 3 I: daß man (? daß das) I: so that they... P: ich hatte überhaupt über nichts P: I hadn't thought about anything at all 4 P: nachgedacht weil ich wie aus heiterm himmel P: because everything right out of the blue 5 I: ja ja I: yes yes P: von den dingen . überrascht wurde, P: just surprised me 6 P: aber da wurde das schon alles äh äh über P: but it was all er, er, more or less taken care of 7 P: meine Frau im grund genommen schon äh n P: through my wife 8 1: &amp; ah so das heißt sie I: ah, so, what happened is P: bißchen gefädelt 9 I: sind ja aufm arbeitsplatz auch umgekippt I: you collapsed at work... 10 1: und es passierte P: &amp; am arbeitsplatz passiert, P: just collapsed at work, IIP: morgens hingefahren mit. genauso . P: went to work one morning, just as.</page><page sequence="16">250 Discourse Studies 5(2) 12 P: fröhlich wie immer und .. (betont) wie aus P: happy as usual. and 13 1: hm (4 Sek. Pause) ja und I: hmm (4-second pause) P: heiterm himmel + P: right out of the blue 14 1: dann hattn sie auch gar nicht überlegt ob I: yes and you never thought about whether 15 1: (Ortsname) oder anderes in ne andre reha klinik (...) I: (name of place) or anywhere else in another rehabilitation centre (...) The patient's placing of relevance is well evident here; it is quite different from that of the interviewer. The subject broached by the interviewer through his question refers to the patient's decision in favour of a particular rehabilitation centre. The person interviewed, on the other hand, accentuates the suddenness of becoming ill (11. 4/5) in a two-fold manner, through the verb surprise and the metaphorical expression out of the blue. A very brief recapitulation of the course of the illness (11.10 ff.) follows the interviewer's rephrased question (I. 8/9 so, what happened is...) and is then concluded by the visualization out of the blue. This image therefore serves as a framework for the reconstruction of the heart attack suffered. The metaphorical expression out of the blue is not only conspicuous through being used twice but also through being emphasized when used for the second time. The speaker therefore gives particular weight to the expression through his manner of speaking; it is apparently a focal aspect of the experience of illness. Even at this point, the illness itself is only referred to as everything (1. 5: von den dingen). When we compare this narration with other descriptions of heart attacks, it can be seen that the expression out of the blue is typical of this illness, or rather, it is typical of the way the patients speak of their illness. From a medical point of view - as one can read in numerous descriptions and explanatory texts - no heart attack happens out of the blue. Experts constantly point out risk factors and prohibitions and the fact that coronary heart disease can often develop over years; they use the metaphor only in order to negate it. However, it is obvious that heart attacks are experienced by those suffering them as being a sudden occurrence and so the metaphor out of the blue could be said to summarize a cen tral element in the patient's experience of the illness, however inappropriate it may be from a purely technical point of view. This example perhaps gives an initial impression of what it means to analyse the way non-experts speak about their illness; it is a matter of working out the descriptive means, in this case figurative means, as well as the recognition of the speaker's placing of relevance. For comparison, I would like to give a second example of a description of a heart attack: Example (10) Brustring (Chest ring) 1 I: ja ich wollte sie zu anfang fragen so wie I ■....well, to begin with 1 want to ask how,</page><page sequence="17">Gülich: Conversational techniques used in transferring knowledge 251 2 I: das äh .. sie h/ ham ne herzerkrankung und= I: er, do you have a heart complaint and 3 I: äh (leiser) welche herz . erkrankung . ham I: er, (more quietly) which heart complaint have you got. 4 I: sie + hm I: hmm P: einen hinterwand .infarkt'.. der P: it was a posterior heart infarction 5 I: hm I: hmm P: lEIder zu spät erkannt worden is' das heißt P: which was unfortunately recognized too late - I mean 6 I: hm I: hmm P: nach zwei tagen erst'., da is dann .. die P: not until after two days.. the 7 P: hilfe die man bekommen kann in/ innerhalb P: help you get in/within the five-hour period 8 P: der fünf. stundenfrist'.. die is natürlich abgelaufen, P: that's passed of course 9 I: ach so . is das . n schwerer I: oh, is that a severe... 10 1: hinterwandinfarkt oder n leichter' (Pinfarkt) I: posterior heart infarction or a slight attack?

This image without doubt represents a different experience of heart attack from the first example and also a different medical process. Moreover, this patient places a different accent in her description of the illness, as right at the beginning she replies to the interviewer's question by adding a relative clause to her description of the heart attack which was unfortunately recognized too late (11. 4-5). She then makes the too late more precise (I mean), adding an exact time (after two days) and then explains the meaning of this (11. 6-9: then the help). In answer to the inter viewer's question, she gives the exact date for both occurrences, the beginning of the illness and the commencement of treatment. Typically, the narration of the heart attack includes a critical reference to the fact that the attack was diagnosed too late, i.e. there was lack of medical expertise, although the patient avoids</page><page sequence="19">Gülich: Conversational techniques used in transferring knowledge 253 blaming individual doctors by resorting to the passive: was recognized too late (cf. Barton, 1996: 313 ff.). With the image of the constantly tightening chest ring, the speaker refers to the occurrence a third time, but this time the emphasis is on the development and not on the contrast between the beginning of illness and the commencement of treatment. The method of representation she uses - apart from imagery - is that of reformulation or rephrasing. The structure of the nar ration is characterized by an increasing expansion, a development from an initial summarizing utterance via two specifications of too late to a metaphorical recon struction of the course of the illness in the third person (the chest ring, a feeling, something loose) - the illness has, so to speak, become independent. There can be no doubt that such utterances from patients convey a type of medical knowledge which is totally different from that of the experts. Löning (1994) defines the way patients talk about such specific personal knowledge as the 'verbalization of an inner reality' (1994: 98 ff.).11 She describes the process which starts with the perception of certain physical phenomena and then leads on to conscious knowledge and finally verbalization as an extremely complex one. Throughout this process what is perceived or learnt has to be made to fit the conceptual categories already available to the patient (1994: 100 f.) Löning distinguishes between three types of categorizations: (1) everyday, non-professional: (2) semi-professional and pseudo-professional; and (3) profes sional.12 While the patient in Example (9) uses exclusively non-professional cate gorizations (everything just surprised me right out of the blue), Example (10) contains both non-professional (the image of the chest ring) and semi-profes sional categorizations (the technical term posterior heart infarction). The utter ances of chronically ill patients frequently contain such traces of technical medical knowledge, for in the course of a long illness patients necessarily acquire a certain amount of expertise in this respect (cf. Willems, 1992; Barton, 1996); they then use it in their descriptions of subjective feelings and perceptions.13 Examples (9) and (10) are different illustrations of the fact that how patients talk about their illness reveals not only their subjective experience of the illness but also their attitude towards it and their way of coping with it. This 'know ledge' and the communication of it from non-expert to expert are just as relevant and worthy of examination as the expertise of experts. The treatment of chronic illnesses such as heart conditions is particularly difficult if the aspect of how the patient copes with the illness is ignored. The cooperation of the patients ('compli ance') is, in my opinion, only possible when knowledge is communicated from patient to doctor and taken seriously. The verbal descriptions patients give of their illnesses can also be of medical use beyond the building up of compliance. In a survey carried out in Heidelberg, for example (Stauder et al., 1996), it was shown that when patients with unde fined angina pectoris symptoms participated in an in-depth diagnostic process carried out in the form of semi-structured interviews, it became possible to dis tinguish between a coronary heart condition and functional circulatory imbal ance. In more than 80 percent of the patients interviewed, the correct diagnosis</page><page sequence="20">254 Discourse Studies 5(2) was made on the basis of what the patients said, before a coronary angiogram was done. The survey shows that the possibilities of evaluating patients' commu nications for the purpose of differential diagnosis have certainly not yet been fully exploited and that this approach could probably be used for other types of illness.14 5. Constitution of the roles of expert and non-expert Experts are not just experts through having acquired certain competences for all time but mainly because they present themselves as such in communication and are accepted and addressed as such by their communication partners. A heart specialist giving a talk to patients in a rehabilitation centre is therefore not simply an expert through having studied medicine: he behaves like an expert, and this is expected of him by his audience, who therefore treat him as such. In the same way, patients are not simply non-experts through not being doctors: they also present themselves as such and are treated as such by their communication part ners, the experts. 'Our social identities are not static or structurally determined, but contextually situated and interactionnally emergent' (Matoesian, 1999: 492). Sometimes the level of expertise is negotiated between the participants (cf. Barton, 1996). In order to describe these 'metapragmatic processes through which speakers and recipients signal who they are and what they are doing at any given interactional moment' (Matoesian, 1999: 493). Goffman (1979) introduced the concept of 'footing'. Footing refers 'to the multiple senses in which the self of the speaker can appear, that is, the multiple self-implicated pro jections discoverable in what is said and done' (1979: 173). Expertise as a con versational phenomenon is an 'interactional achievement' (Schegloff, 1982). Interest in the analysis of communication between experts and non-experts is therefore directed towards the techniques used by the participants to establish expert and non-expert roles (cf. e.g. Matoesian, 1999).15 Some of these techniques can be observed in the following excerpts. One of the most obvious procedures is self-categorization as expert (e.g. we doctors) and other-categorization (e.g. the audience being addressed as patients). Categorizations of this type are made simply through the use of category names (doctors, patients); they reinforce the difference in status between the communication partners. While these procedures make expert status explicit, a similar less explicit effect can be achieved in more indirect ways. Thus an expert can make clear his status by 'category-bound activities' (Sacks, 1992, vol. 1:1,6), such as reformula tion, illustration or the explicit introduction of specialist terms following a description in colloquial language (e.g. a so-called afterburn phase in Example (1) earlier). Other procedures characteristically used by experts are: making explicit refer ence to research results (Example 11) and evaluating the work of others and the quality of information material available (Example 12):</page><page sequence="21">Gülich: Conversational techniques used in transferring knowledge 255 Example (11) Streßbewältigung (Handling stress) 1 man hat' in der streßforschung vor allen dingen zwei (Tafelschreibgeräusche) typen von (...) in stress research two (sound of writing on blackboard) types of 2 streßsituationen unterschieden'.. die eine ist überschrieben herAUSforderung' (...) stress situations have been established, one is known as challenge 3 (... Tafelschreibgeräusche) und dann kommt die kontrollbedrohung das klingt n bißchen (sound of writing on blackboard) and then there's threat to control - that may sound a bit 4 komisch vielleicht aber ich werd das gleich erläutern, + .. funny but I'll explain it in a minute... Example (12) Bypass When a patient asks if there is a film about a cardiac valve operation, the cardiologist answers: 1 der Is nich gUt, den haben wir:. beDAUernd' aus dem verkehr gezogen, it's not good, we've unfortunately had to take it out of circulation 2 weil er/ . weil er nich erfreulich is, weil er mEhr ist'.. auch für Ärzte gedreht because it's/because it's not satisfactory, because it's more.. made for doctors 3 und er is schlAMpig gedreht, er is schlampig im tExt,. und wir haben das Immer erlebt' and it's badly filmed, poor text and we've found this again and again 4 er macht mehr . der klAppenfilm. konFUses'. und ängste' als er nutzen bringt, it causes more confusion, the valve film, and fear, than it helps In Example (11) the expert presents research results, thus documenting her pro fessional expertise; she presents them as obviously obscure to her audience (a bit funny - n bißchen komisch) and so announces one of the typical category-bound activities: I'll explain. Example (12) similarly illustrates how by evaluating a film on cardiac-valve operations the expert provides proof of her professional competence and her role as mediator in the knowledge transfer process. Finally, the role of expert can be said to be defined by the way the expert struc tures the interaction, raises relevant points or anticipates the reactions of the persons being addressed: Example (13) Herz und Sport (Heart and sport) 1 .. dann möcht=ich ganz gerne noch . das: thema behandeln . trainingsHÄUfigkeit'. .. so now I'd just like to deal with the subject of frequency of exercise, duration of 2 trainingsdAUer'. da: werdn eignllch auch immer von patientnseitn frAgn gestellt &amp; wie oft exercise, questions are always asked by the patients how often 3 SOLL ich denn trainlern' shall I exercise? The expert's utterance shows that he is fully aware of points likely to be raised by patients, has first-hand experience of the problems of expert/non-expert com munication and regards this as a defining part of his role. Procedures used by patients to show themselves to be non-experts can also be described. The patient in the following excerpt from a conversation about a heart</page><page sequence="22">256 Discourse Studies 5(2) valve operation does have an opinion on a doctor's neglect but still emphasizes her own status as a non-expert: Example (14) Herzklappen-Operation (Heart valve operation) 1 und dann hamse festgestellt daß die Herzklappe wohl irgendwie ziemlich betroffen war and then they found out that the heart valve was somehow rather affected 2 un(d) meiner meinung nach hätte der eine arzt das damals bei and to my mind the doctor that was there when 3 dem schlauchschlucken schon feststellen müssen I had to swallow the tube should have seen this 4 ich weiß nicht ich meine ich bin kein mediziner. naja und da hat die oberärztin gesacht (...) I don't know... I'm not a doctor... well and then the doctor in charge said (...) This patient, too, resorts to the technique of explicit self-categorization (I'm not a doctor) and she uses it to soften her criticism of a doctor's lack of competence (should have seen this). In the following example the patient uses a more indirect procedure to pres ent himself as a non-expert. On being asked by the interviewer whether he had had a slight or a severe heart attack, he shows clear marks of uncertainty in his reply: Example (15) Herzinfarkt (Heart attack) 1 Ja ich mein ahm, soll n schwErer gewesen sein insofern weil äh, well, I think er it must have been a severe one because er, 2 ich wohl im krankenhaus, wiederbelebt werden mußte. I had to be resuscitated in the hospital 3 mit/ also mit elektroschocks ham die dat gemacht ja . also von with/well they did it with electric shocks 4 daher denk ich wohl wars nicht so einfach so 1 suppose it wasn't a slight one By using must have been, I think, I suppose, the speaker relativizes the information he is able to give as a layman. There is a stark contrast between this technique of relativizing on the part of the patient and the fact that the attack was clearly a life-threatening one. The colloquial expression nicht so einfach {it wasn't a slight one) would seem to confirm this softening tendency. The role of expert as well as that of non-expert implies a certain perspective and knowledge of the illness. As the two perspectives are radically different, con versation between the parties concerned also has to mediate between the differ ing perspectives. In studies on expert-layperson communication, this aspect has so far been given much less attention than, for example, metaphorics or the use of specialist vocabulary. However, the divergence of perspective is undoubtedly one of the main reasons why communication in medical contexts is often unsat isfactory or considered unsuccessful. A bypass or a heart valve operation, for example, is a routine case for a highly specialized heart surgeon; for the patient, on the other hand, it is usually a unique and central event in his life.</page><page sequence="23">Giilich: Conversational techniques used in transferring knowledge 25 7 These varying perspectives are the subject of discussion by the expert in the following excerpt: Example (16) Bypass 1 das ist die HÄUfigst gemachteste operation' in deutschland,. this is the most frequently performed operation in Germany, 2 die ist EINfacher als n mA:gen' und ne galle,.. simpler than a stomach or gall-bladder... 3 (es) is WIRKlich nur für den patiENten, eine so ANdere situation,. it's really a completely different situation only for the patient.. 4 (es) is WEniger gefährlich als n mAg:en und ne ,gAlle . it's less dangerous than a stomach or a gall-bladder 5 und es ist mEIst weniger schmerzhaft, nich Immer,. and usually less painful, not always, 6 Als:. n ma:gen:'. oder ne gAlle:. oder ein bAUch (Paortenaneurysma). than a stomach or a gall-bladder or an abdomen (?aorta aneurysma) . 7 es is die routinlERteste' und HÄUfigst gemachteste operation it's the most routine and most frequently performed operation 8 in deutschland, &amp; und amerika, ...vierzigTAUsend etwa, pro JAhr,. in Germany and America, about 40,000 a year, 9 das heißt. die Operateure die NICHTS anderes als das TUn,. that means the operating surgeons who do nothing else than that 10 tun das vIEl leichter:. als ein Chirurg' eines Stadtkrankenhauses do it much more easily than a surgeon in a town hospital, 11 der n dAR:m ne gAlle: NIE're: nen knOchenbruch . who does a colon, a gall-bladder, a kidney, a fracture 12 der jEden tag was andres hat, who has something different every day 13 der die ganze UNfallchirurgie machen muß . who has to do all the casualty surgery, 14 'das ist alles . plAnbar für den Chirurgen sehr geordnet.. that can all be planned all well arranged for the surgeon 15 und .. hat/ is natürlich Völlig anders and has/is completely different 16 aus der sieht des Chirurgen der das tÄglich macht' from the surgeon's point of view, who does it every day 17 als für SIE alle , die das 'ein einziges mal so Hüffe ich . erleben,. than it is for you who, I hope, will experience it only once. By referring to the frequency (which is even emphasized by a figure: 40,000), the routine manner, the high degree of specialization (the operating surgeons who do nothing else) and by stressing of the planning and arrangement factor, the cardi ologist first builds up the surgeon's perspective and at the same time expresses aspects which mean security for the patients. However, in clear contrast, she expresses their perspectives (quite different), which she had already announced at the beginning (really a completely different situation only for the patient). This con trast is expressed here in the opposition between daily and just once. The cardiolo gist assumes the viewpoint of the person affected and thus lessens the divergence of perspective.</page><page sequence="24">258 Discourse Studies 5(2) The example shows that it is perfectly possible for an expert to take appropri ate account of a non-expert's perspective. What prevents communication from being as successful as it could be is not the expert's superior technical knowledge but his/her tendency to over-emphasize his/her role in the partnership. This is experienced by the patient as a lack of cooperation, which makes compliance difficult. 6. Conclusion The much discussed and frequently criticized opaqueness of experts' speech - usually blamed on the use of technical terms ('jargon') - is, of course, one of the factors which makes communication between experts and non-experts difficult or even impossible. But it is not the only factor nor even the most important one. Research on expert-layperson communication, therefore, should not only focus on technical terms or terminology, but pay much more attention to conversa tional methods and to the constitution of experts' and non-experts' roles. Reformulation and illustration are techniques which allow experts to use estab lished technical terms while at the same time taking account of what a non expert can be expected to know. In summary, it is not technical terms as such that cause problems of communication; it is how they are handled. Reformulations are particularly helpful in that they enable technical and non technical terms to be used side by side in such a way that they illuminate each other. The main function of illustration procedures, especially of examples, sce narios, and concretizations, seems to be relating abstract medical information to everyday life and experience. This appears to be a general feature by which the communication of technical knowledge in face-to-face interaction can be distin guished from media discourse. Experts tend to use illustration techniques as a deliberate device; metacommunicative elements ('accountings') are a case in point. Furthermore, the analysis of our corpus has highlighted the fact that there is and remains serious divergence of perspectives, a factor which has often been neglected in research on knowledge transfer. This divergence of perspectives may also be responsible for unsuccessful communication between experts and non experts. Techniques designed to mediate between the different perspectives belong to the conversational methodology of this type of communication, too, and should therefore be taken much more seriously, both in research and on the level of practical day-to-day communication with patients. For this to happen it is essential to realize that so-called 'non-experts' (in this case, patients) are also experts of a kind. Specific knowledge of their own case, the subjective side of their illness must be seen as knowledge which is as worthy of communication as expert knowledge in the traditional sense. If from a conversation-analytical point of view expertise is an 'interactional achievement', the distinction commonly made between experts and non-experts is not as sound a basis for theoretical work as it might seem. As Willems says,</page><page sequence="25">Gülich: Conversational techniques used in transferring knowledge 259 'When taking the lay-professional distinction as a basis for theorizing in and on medicine, we act as if lay people and patients exist, just like that, outside of any negotiation or - even - construction process' (1992: 113-14). Expertise has to be considered as a 'dynamic construct, one that is continually and repeatedly negotiated within the context of a medical encounter' (Barton, 1996: 303). This is basic to the success of expert/non-expert communication. In evaluating the contributions to 'Lay diagnosis' (Beach, 2001), Drew observes an increasing tendency in the study of medical interaction 'to bring into clearer focus not only the patient's perspective in a general sense, but also the way that impacts on the interaction between patient and doctor' (Drew, 2001: 262). The topic of 'lay diagnosis', ten Have concludes, is 'far from exhausted' (2001: 259). On the contrary, it is likely to become more and more relevant, both for research and for practical clinical purposes. This article is related to a current research project which is being carried out jointly with Gisela Brünner (Dortmund) and which, in addition to the kind of work presented here, covers the popularization of medical knowledge in and by the media, i.e. radio and television (cf. Brünner and Gülich, 2002). It is designed to answer a number of theoretical questions and to provide proposals for practi cal application. We hope that it will be possible to draw practical conclusions from our analysis and that linguistics will thus be able to contribute to improve ments in communication between experts and non-experts. To achieve this we certainly need to revise our ideas of what constitutes an expert. We should in future ask whether techniques preferred by non-experts should perhaps be studied much more closely than has been the case in the past. Linguistic analyses of empirically established data from authentic examples of expert/non-expert communication have been shown to provide a suitable basis for the definition of procedures that characteristically occur in situations of this type. These results can certainly not be used to provide 'packaged easy-to-use solutions to felt problems', but they might be 'helpful in terms of developing an overall sensitivity for the intricacies of talk-in-interaction' (ten Have, 1999: 200), i.e. they can be used to sensitize experts such as hospital staff engaged in conveying medical information to patients.

This paper is a revised and expanded version of Gülich (1999). 2. Cf. Thiel and Thome (2001) for a list of procedures used in explanation sequences. 3. Please note that there is no attempt in the English translations to render the prosodie features of the original. The analysis throughout is based on the original German text. 4. The role of reformulation techniques in knowledge transfer between, among others, doctors and patients is examined in detail by Biihrig (1996). 5. The concept of illustration used here was developed jointly with Gisela Brünner; cf. Brünner (1999), Gülich (1999) and Brünner and Gülich (2002). 6. See, for example, Mayer (1993) for the instructive function of metaphor; see also Biere and Liebert (1997) and Liebert (1997). 7. An example of another, non-metaphorical, form of illustration is examined by Schwitalla (1991), although his research is based on everyday conversation rather than expert/non-expert communication; he found two types of narrative illustration, (a) the repeated telling of action sequences and (b) the telling of one special event. - On the analysis of the procedure of exemplification see also Caffi and Hölker (1995) and Keppler ( 19 8 8). 8. Buchholz (for example, 1996; 1998) and Buchholz and von Kleist (1995) use this concept of metaphor in their analysis of therapist/patient interaction. The role of metaphors in doctor/patient communication is examined by Schachtner (1999). 9. These subjective aspects are stressed by Ehlich (1985: 178); 'Whatever the psycholog ical characteristics of pain may be, in most theoretical accounts, pain is conceptual ized as a, if not the form of individual sensation. As pain is seen as an individual sensation, the problems of pain appear as a consequence of its individualized charac ter'. For the interactive organization of pain description see Heath (1989). 10. Examples (9 ) and ( 10) as well as ( 15) have been taken from interviews conducted in a research project on cardiological rehabilitation, cf. Badura et al. (1996). 11. Compare the distinction of different types of knowledge in Ehlich and Rehbein (1977), where this type is described as 'partikulares Erlebniswissen' (knowledge derived from individual experience). 12. Löning's paper, which takes Rehbein (1993) as its starting point, offers an analysis of conversations between doctors and patients. Her subject is the transformation of patients' knowledge into professional medical knowledge. By contrast, the patients' utterances quoted here have been taken from interviews with non-professionals. The distinctions introduced by Löning remain relevant, however. 13. This is borne out by Wiese's results (1994), which are based on a questionnaire submitted to patients suffering from chronic hepatitis. 14. It is the aim of a current research project ('Linguistische Differentialtypologie epileptischer und anderer anfallsartiger Störungen. Diagnostische und therapeutische Aspekte') sponsored by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (1.3.1999-28.2. 2001) to establish whether there are links between formulating procedures and the type of illness a patient suffers from. A few results concerning the distinctions</page><page sequence="27">Gülich: Conversational techniques used in transferring knowledge 261 between different types of epileptic seizure have been published in Giilich and Schöndienst (1999), Wolf et al. (2000) and Surmann (2002). 15. This is shown by Atkinson (1999) in an interesting medical setting, namely case pre sentations by doctors to doctors; he investigates 'the delicate processes whereby med ical knowledge is deployed, challenged, warranted and shared' (1999: 80) and how professional responsibility is 'constructed'; compare also Sarangi and Roberts (1999b). Brünner (1997) analyses quite a different constellation; she observes the evaluation and negotiation of technical competence between expert and client in a computer service centre.
