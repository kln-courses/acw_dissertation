<plain_text><page sequence="1">MILTON AND AN ANTHROPOMORPHIC GOD By JOHN E. PARISH There are three brief and similar stories in the Old Testament which, as a group, caused John Milton some anxiety until he discovered a satisfactory way of interpreting them. Though he makes no direct reference to them in Paradise Lost, it can be shown that he wrote two significant episodes of the poem with these tales in mind. Each story is about a man debating with the Lord, respectfully but doggedly opposing a divine decree, and by earnest and shrewd argument wheedling the Lord into changing his mind. In Genesis. xviii, when Abraham learns that the Lord intends to destroy Sodom, he tries to dissuade him. Ostensibly concerned with preserving the Lord's reputation for righteousness, Abraham tactfully calls atten- tion to the danger, in destroying the city, of slaying some good men along with the vicious majority. "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?" asks Abraham; and the Lord, evidently glad to be warned against an error, agrees to spare Sodom if as many as fifty righteous men are to be found within its walls. The concession emboldens Abraham to argue further, though he apologizes for his presumption. Suppose only forty-five righteous are to be found: will the Lord raze the city for lack of five to make up the designated fifty? The discussion continues between the shrewd just man and the slower-witted but not intractable god, until the Lord agrees finally to spare Sodom if as many as ten good men can be found there. The second tale appears in Exodus. xxxii. The children of Israel have so offended Jehovah by worshipping the golden calf that he has sworn to annihilate them. Moses, resolved on a milder punishment, reminds the Lord of his promises to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. He also points out something which the Lord in his anger must have overlooked: the Egyptians will ridicule Jehovah if, after leading these people out of Egypt, he defeats his ow-n purpose by destroying them. Impressed, "the Lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people." A similar story, with Moses again in the role of intercessor, appears in Numbers. xiv. On the Lord's instructions Moses has 619</page><page sequence="2">620 Milton and an Anthropomorphic God sent pre-invasion spies into the land of Canaan. Except for Joshua and Caleb, all the scouts upon their return have advised against invading the country, reporting that the inhabitants are giants who will easily repulse the Israelites. Furious at such a false report, the Lord again blusters out a threat to smite the Israelites with pestilence and to disinherit them; but Moses, with infinite patience and shrewd understanding of Jehovah's vanity, again points out how such severity will affect the Lord's fame with both the Egyptians and the Canaanites, who will say, " Because the Lord is not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness." By Moses's persuasion Jehovah is induced to spare the people once again-or at least to mollify the sentence threatened against them. These summaries are based on the kind of interpretation which an unbiased student of comparative literature would give to the stories. Examining the Bible as dispassionately as any other early mythology, such a critic would probably consider it obvious that the author of each story (and the earliest readers) felt more affection for the mortal advocate than for the blustering god with whom he disputes. In each tale the man seems more serene, more merciful, and even more intelligent than the Lord. (One is reminded of the legend of philanthropic Prometheus, who tricked Zeus into choosing the fat and bones of sacrificed animals and leaving the flesh for man.) Milton, of course, could not possibly have accepted such an interpretation of biblical stories. Believing that a Christian need explore no further than the Bible in order to arrive at the loftiest attainable conception of God, he gave the following advice in his De doctrina christiana: Our safest way is to form in our minds such a conception of God, as shall co,rrespond with his own delineation and representation of himself in the sacred writings. For granting that both in the literal and figurative descriptions of God, he is exhibited not as he really is, but in such a manner as may be within the scope of our comprehensions, yet we ought to entertain such a conception of him, as he, in condescending to accommodate himself to our capacities, has shown that he desires we should conceive. For it is on this very account that he has lowered himself to our level, lest in our flights above the reach of human understanding, and beyond the written word of Scripture, we should be tempted to indulge in vague congitations and subtleties.' 1 The Worke of John Milton, Vol. XIV, New York: Columbia University Press, 1933, pp. 31-33.</page><page sequence="3">John E. Parish 621 Assuredly, in writing this passage, Milton had in mind biblical stories like the three under discussion heie. He anticipated-and rejected-the kind of interpretation attributed above to "the unbiased moderm reader." There is no need then tllat theologians should have recourse here to what they call anthropopathy, a figure invented by the grammarians to excuse the absurdities of the poets on the subject of the heathen divinities. We may be sure that sufficient care has been taken that the Holy Scriptures should contain nothing unsuitable to the character or dignity of God, and that God should say nothing of himself which could derogate from his own majesty.2 Holding a lofty conception of a just and merciful God and yet believing that every word in the Scriptures was divinely inspired, Milton felt constrained to discover an interpretation of the tales about Abraham and Moses that would reconcile two seeming contradictions: a literal acceptance of the crude stories and an exalted idea of the Deity. How he solved the problem can be demonstrated, not by pointing out any direct reference in his writings to these specific stories, but by showing that two episodes in Paradise Lost were invented as additional stories with the same motif. The spirit of the invented scenes, it may confidently be assumed, is the spirit in which Milton believed one should read the tales of Abraham's and Moses's arguments with Jehovah. I. Paradise Lost, III, 80-172. The first is in Book III, lines 80-172. God the Father, after informing the Son that man shall fall, has added that man, because he is less guilty than the fallen angels, shall still fiand grace, shall feel God's mercy. The first part of the Son's response to this announcement is derived from Abraham's plea for Sodom; direct quotation and the same literary device of repetition are employed. Abraham says, "Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked? . . . That be far from thee to do after this manner, to destroy the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?" These are the words of the Son: "Ibid., p. 33.</page><page sequence="4">622 Milton and ait Anthropomorphic God For should Man finally be lost, should Man Thy creature late so lov'd, thy youngest Son Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though join'd With his own folly? that be from thee far, That far be from thee, Father, who art Judge Of all things made, and judgest only right." (III, 150-165) Though the modern reader may find no resemblance between the two situations (Abraham seems to be schooling a rather alow- thinking god in his obligation to be just, and the Son of God is simply demonstrating his own understanding of the mercy which the Father has already promised), Milton's obvious borrowings from Genesis. xviii show that he read into the biblical tale the same gentle spirit which he wrote into the dialogue between God and the Son. The Lord, he concluded, was not really persuaded by Abraham to reverse a decision to destroy righteous men with the unrighteous. God is incapable of injustice. The concessions which Abraham seems (at first reading of the story) to wring from him have been from the beginning a part of the divine plan. God encourages Abraham to dispute with him because he is training Abraham in disputation; Abraham is allowed to plead for justice because in doing so he clarifies in his own mind the meaning of justice and thus further qualifies himself to lead a chosen people. As Milton interpreted it, the story is a father-son debate. God, a loving father, pretends to argue with Abraham so that this favorite son can exercise his reason. Like a human father, God delights in conceding victory to his " opponent " when the clever child advances irrefutable truths to support his case.4 I I am indebted to one of SP's alert readers, whose identity has not been revealed to me, for calling to my attention that Thomas Newton in his 1749 edition of P. L., briefly annotated lines 153-5 of Book III as "an imitation of Genesis. xviii. 25." ' Charles Williams, in 1938, interpreted the story as generously as Milton did: " The climax of those anthropomorphic appearances is in that most admirably composed passage of words with Abraham concerning Sodom. Up to then the few conversations between man and the Omnipotence have been extremely one-sided. But now there appears something new: the conversation becomes a dialogue. The remoteness and rigour of the Lord take on a tenderness-almost (but for the terror of the subject) a laughter-and there exists not only a promise but a reply. The promise, that is, becomes a fuller and richer thing; it is the whole meaning of prayer." He Came Down From Heaven (London, 1938), pp. 26-7.</page><page sequence="5">John E. Parish 623 In Paradise Lost, as the Son continues his speech in Book III, one can detect echoes of the two legends in which Moses pleads for the Israelites. In Exodus. xxxii Moses reminds the Lord that he has promised to make a great nation of the Israelites and warns him that the Egyptians will ridicule him if he destroys the very people he set out to save. In Numbers. xiv the argument is much the same: "Then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying, Because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness. And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying, The Lord is long-suffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression." Milton has the Son of God speak in a somewhat similar manner, explaining the necessity of mercy. UJnless man after the Fall find grace, Satan will be able to boast of frustrating God's original purpose, and So should thy goodness and thy greatness both Be question'd and blasphem'd without defence. (III, 165-166)6 The three Old Testament stories were grouped together in Milton's mind, then. All were mock debates. God never intended to slay the Israelites, but he did intend to give Moses practice in arguing for mercy and forgiveness. Once having arrived at this interpretation of the tales, Milton was convinced that this was how God expected all men to read the stories. In "condescending to accommodate himself to our capacities," God has certainly not stooped to words which he that runs can read: the devout reader must still ponder and analyze and weigh various interpretations before determining on the right one. Indeed, the devout reader must be as alert and as resourceful as John Milton himself. II. Paradise Lost, VIII, 352-451 The episode in Book III lacks the dramatic suspense of a debate because God the Father makes no pretense of disagreeing with the lIn P. L., IX, 938-51, Adam (as he prepares to eat the forbidden fruit) voices an argument shockingly similar to that of the Son of God. Yet Adam's speech (which also echoes those of Moses in Exodus. xxxii and Numbers.xiv) is blasphemous. Milton's reason for this deliberate parallel is not clear to me.</page><page sequence="6">624 Milton and an Anthropomorphic God Son and has announced his intention to show mercy on fallen man even before the Son presents the case for mercy. Later in Paradise Lost, however, Milton creates a second fictional episode which exactly reproduces the motif he found in the tales about Abraham and Moses-the motif of a loving father pretending to dispute with his son. In Book VIII, lines 352-451, Adam tells Raphael about a " celestial colloquy " which he had with the Almighty soon after his creation. The colloquy is pure invention, there being no suggestion of such a disputation in the biblical account of the Creation. When God has caused all the animals to pass in review before Adam and receive from him their names, Adam experiences a feeling of disappointment. In his precocious self-knowledge he is sure that Paradise is imperfect until a suitable companion has been provided for him. (" In these / I found not what methought I wanted still.") Consequently Adam presumes to inform God that something essential is lacking by asking what contentment man can expect to find in solitude. When God, smiling but pretending to speak seriously, suggests the animals as fit com- panions, Adam humbly but insistently argues that there can be no fellowship between superiors and inferiors. God, "not dis- pleas'd" with Adam's reasoning, still pretends to be unconvinced; he points out that he himself has no such equal associate as Adam is asking for, yet does not lack happiness. Adam promptly replies that God, perfect in himself, has no need of such companionship; that God, already infinite, has no need to propagate himself; and that God, if he wishes to, can raise man to a level high enough for communication with him-something man cannot do with the beasts. Concluding the account of his presumptuous dispute with God, Adam says to Raphael, Thus I embold'n'd spake, and freedom us'd Permissive, and acceptance found. (VIII, 434-435) Nowhere else in Paradise Lost is there so tender a scene between God and man. Here, for once, the sense of humor which Milton attributes to God is appealing. Adam is emboldened to argue because the smile on God's face tells him that God is merely teasing him! And the episode is material from the simple Old Testament disputes with God, transfigured by generous interpre. tation.</page><page sequence="7">John E. Parish 625 God's reply to Adam, whieh concludes the discussion, is in the following words: Thus far to try thee, Adam, I was pleas'd, And find thee knowing not of Beasts alone, Which thou hast rightly nam'd, but of thyself, Expressing well the spirit within thee free, My image, not imparted to the Brute, Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike, And be so minded still; I, ere thou spak'st, Knew it not good for Man to be alone, And no such company as then thou saw't Intended thee, for trial only brought, To see how thou couldst judge of fit and meet: What next I bring shall please thee, be assur'd, Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self, Thy wish, exactly to thy heart's desire. (VIII, 437-451) There is the same note of paternal pride here that is heard in Book III, when God replies to the Son's speech about mercy: O Son, in whom my Soul hath chief delight, Son of my bosom, Son who art alone My word, my wisdom, and effectual might, All hast thou spok'n as my thoughts are, all As my Eternal purpose hath decreed. (III, 168-172) In Milton's opinion, devout readers of the tales about Abraham and Moses disputing with God should, using their imaginations, supplement the terse Scriptural accounts with concluding state- ments from God in this same affectionate tone. Ere Abraham spake, God knew that righteous men must not perish in the destruction of Sodom; ere Moses spake, God knew that he must be long-suffering and tender of mercy to the wayward Israelites. He heard the arguments of these chosen intercessors "thus far to try them." The Rice Institute</page></plain_text>
