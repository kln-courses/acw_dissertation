Part 1 of this study, the present article, presents a large collection of terracotta plaques and figurines from the sanctuary (ca. 630-450 B.C.E.). Part 2, to appear in a forthcoming issue of the AJA, will deal with a mostly later assemblage of lamps and pottery (ca. 500-150). These assemblages span a critical period in Cretan religious history and mark a transition from an orientalizing to a classical form of worship. Dis cussion here focuses on the art historical and religious significance of the terracotta plaques and figurines as well as the political dimensions of cult. The iconography of the plaques hints at male rite of passage ceremonies at a simple spring sanctuary of a goddess charged with natural fertility and human growth. She is depicted in the seventh century as a frontal nude crowned by a polos, an assimilation of a Near Eastern type. It is argued that Roussa Ekklesia functioned as a territorial marker for the state of Praisos, with the beginning of cult activity coin ciding with the rise of this polis as a regional power. This study also examines the impact of representational styles as constituents of civic and ethnic identity.* INTRODUCTION The modern village of Roussa Ekklesia lies in the foothills of the east Siteia mountain range (Ziros high lands) approximately 9 km southeast of Siteia, the capital of the easternmost administrative district of Crete (fig. 1). Another 2 km east of Roussa Ekklesia, above the church of Timios Stavros, are the remains of an ancient sanctuary. A footpath from the church winds around the mountain crags for approximately 300 m before passing the ancient site. An elliptical outcropping on the exposed side of a natural hollow formed by a ravine delineates the sanctuary area. This location offers views of the nearby peaks of the east Siteia range to the south and the lower foothills and sea to the northeast. Known locally as Anoixe (spring), a freshwater spring feeds a line of reeds in the crev ice of the ravine. Residents give another reason for the toponym, punning on the secondary meaning of Anoixe (open) to refer to the unpredictable flow of the spring: it "opens" or "closes" without warning. If the spring ebbed and flowed in antiquity as well, it might have contributed to the association of the place with the divine by conveying the unpredictable natural powers in need of appeasement. A combina tion of features?spring, sheltered hollow, and ellip tical outcropping?makes this a suitable location for a simple, open-air cult. Two large trees mark the ap proximate area of the excavated votive deposits, with modern terrace walls and a low field wall encircling the rock (fig. 2).1 Illicit digging brought the site to the attention of Platon, who began systematic excavations in 1952 by clearing out much of the material from the two votive pits. He published a brief account of his work and de scription of the finds, including drinking cups, kernoi, lamps, and terracottas of orientalizing style.2 They were stored in the Herakleion Archaeological Museum until a new facility in Siteia made possible their return to east Crete. Papadakis, the late ephor of antiquities for east Crete, resumed excavations at the site in 1982 and al * This work is dedicated to the memory of Nikos Papadakis. My involvement with Roussa Ekklesia began in 1998, when Pa padakis invited me to collaborate on publication of material from his and Platon's excavations. Papadakis' death in 2000 is a great loss for Cretan archaeology. Unfortunately, his notes and drawings on Roussa Ekklesia have been lost, so this ac count of his excavations depends on conversations and writ ten communications to supplement brief published reports. I would like to thank Villy Apostolakou and the staff of the 24th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities for their help in securing permits. This study would not have been pos sible without their kind assistance. I thank Chronis Papaniko lopoulos and the INSTAP Study Center at Pacheia Ammos for assistance with photography. I am also grateful to Ralph Gallucci, Matthew Haysom, Sara Jones, Oliver Pilz, Vance Wa trous, and James Whitley for reading earlier drafts of this pa per. All dates are B.C.E. except in my account of excavation histories and scholarship. 1 Older residents of Roussa Ekklesia remember these con structions dating to the early or middle part of the 20th cen tury, when they used the spring to water a small garden plot. For the sake of convenience, Roussa Ekklesia is here used to refer to the ancient sanctuary site. 2Platon 1954. Earlier archaeologists, including Schacher meyer (1938, 474-77) and Walter (1940, 305), saw votives from what may have been Anoixe, although they do not spec ify the location. 353 American Journal of Archaeology 113 (2009) 353-404</page><page sequence="2">354 BRICE ERICKSON [AJA 113 \ k ^ NgreeceC^ * f I italy Y 4 8s TURKEY Eastern Mediterranean Sea / y~^\ J ( ^-v_ / r^"^ (itanos ) libya ^_^ ^3^\^-^ U I _ egypt_I / ^ } V r::r siteia S\ j , /palaikastro Vv^^y / / -^y^yf koutsoulopetres f &lt;/ ( ^ / ^ * anoixe v J - _p ' lapsanari ( .0o^ roussa ( J ekklesia ( I An ' ,-, ,200m \ ( 400m n \ 600m , \ ' \ f?' \ hagios georgios - \ ; '( praisos ^ / vavelli I. ) \ * .profitis elias stou koukou # J * \ to kephali \ / ^ , ^?^ /i(ato zakros / \ r ' ?moulas j 600m * ' , ^ ) ^ % ^^Vambelos j ' . - 400m .

Sanctuary site at Anoixe near Roussa Ekklesia, view from the south. most doubled the number of finds.3 The material from Platon and Papadakis' excavations now resides in two crates in the storeroom of the Siteia Archaeological Museum, with a selection of objects on display. This material documents activity across a prob lematic turning point in Cretan religious history: the transition from an orientalizing phase with Near East ern connections to a classical pattern with its roots in mainland Greek practice. The transition is ambigu ous because it comes during a dark chapter of Cretan history and archaeology (ca. 600-400), a period of "silence" characterized by thin evidence and histori cal uncertainty.4 Some have labeled this a period of artistic and cultural decline,5 a characterization that has discouraged investigations of structural changes in the economic, political, and religious life of the island. Early Iron Age (ca. 900-600) sanctuaries, with their rich series of bronze and ivory votives, have long been a focus of excavation, and Cretan examples with the most lavish and plentiful votives, such as the Idaean cave, rank among the richest sanctuaries in the Ae gean. East Crete, however, has received less attention than other parts of the island. Delays in publication have made it difficult to assess recently discovered vo tive deposits at Siteia, Hagios Georgios (near Praisos), Lapsanari, Stou Koukou to Kephali (near Epano Za kro), and other eastern sites. While individual plaque and figurine types at Roussa Ekklesia are attested else where, the parallels come from scattered sources, most often museum collections of unknown provenance.6 Moreover, in the 30 years since the last publication of a comparable sanctuary assemblage, new perspectives on the orientalizing phenomenon suggest it was not a spontaneous artistic development but a class move 3Papadakis 1982, pi. 273b; 1983,86. 4Stampolidis (1990, 400) coined the term; see also Board man 1982, 230; Morris 1992, 157; Viviers 1994; Whidey 1997, 659; Morris 1998, 65-8; Coldstream and Huxley 1999, 303; Kotsonas 2002,62; Haggis et al. 2004,349; Prent 2005,218. 5Dunbabin (1957,40), Figueira (1981, 279), Morris (1992, 169-70), Ridgway (1993, 30), and Viviers (1995, 268-69) framed the issue as an artistic or economic decline. Watrous (1982, 22) proposed an environmental explanation. 6 Plaques identical to examples at Roussa Ekklesia appear in the collections of the British Museum, the Ashmolean, and the Louvre. The source for most of the plaques is given as Prai sos, with no recorded archaeological context. Other collec tions are not as well known or remain unpublished. E.g., the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts possesses three unpublished plaques of types found at Roussa Ekklesia: a nude with po los (inv. no. 71.32.2), a male votary (inv. no. 71.32.3), and a warrior abducting a youth (inv. no. 71.32.4). I am grateful to the curator of the antiquities collection, Peter Schertz, for this information.</page><page sequence="4">356 BRICE ERICKSON [AJA 113 ment with important political dimensions.7 Along side these reassessments of class and artistic styles, de Polignac has linked rural sanctuaries to the territorial claims of the emerging polis, advocating an approach in which Roussa Ekklesia and similar sites have a bear ing on state formation.8 Yet these new frameworks have not always been strongly founded in evidence, since many collections of seventh-century votives have come through illicit digs with no documentation. Eventual publication of other sanctuaries will make it possible to frame developments at Roussa Ekklesia in a clearer regional context. ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXT This assemblage comes from votive dumps in what seems to be a simple rural sanctuary, with no trace of a sacred building, temenos wall, or subsidiary struc ture.9 Archaeologists have uncovered votive deposits without associated architecture elsewhere on Crete. For example, a large deposit discovered on the neck of land connecting Poros to the island proper marks the probable location of an archaic and classical sanc tuary at ancient Olous. Votives include terracotta figurines and lamps, among them elaborate versions with multiple nozzles.10 Despite the clear votive char acter of these finds, no cult building came to light. At Gortyn, a large votive deposit thought to belong to a spring sanctuary of Demeter and Persephone based on figurine types also lacks a documented architectural focus.11 In addition, a spring sanctuary at Vavelli near Praisos produced hundreds of terracotta plaques but no sign of an altar, temple, or other form of architec tural elaboration.12 In the absence of cult buildings, does the fmdspot of a votive deposit mark the location of an ancient sanctu ary? It is generally assumed that sanctuary personnel periodically cleared excess votives and dumped them and other refuse within the confines of the sanctuary.13 As the property of the gods, even decommissioned vo tives were expected to remain in sacred ground. The dumps on the Athenian Acropolis and at Olympia bear witness to this principle of ritual disposal. But was there a universal prohibition against removing defunct offerings from sacred ground? Archaeologists rarely dig outside the known boundaries of sanctuar ies, so it is difficult to answer this question. An excep tion on Crete is the Sanctuary of Demeter at Knossos, where a small temple and a short stretch of a possible temenos wall delineate the sacred space.14 Successive votive pits were recovered inside the reconstructed sacred boundary, and none was found outside it. The absence of architectural remains at some other sites may be a function of poor preservation or an accurate indication of modest surroundings. At Roussa Ekklesia, the rocky outcropping (ca. 30 x 50 m) makes sense as a focal point for cult, with ritual performances accommodating 100 or more people. The slopes of the surrounding hills could have provid ed rough seating for larger gatherings, although there is no sign of ancient terracing. Two shallow pits cut in the middle of the outcropping provide the only direct evidence for cult. These cavities reportedly contained a mixture of earlier and later material, and the exca vators made no distinction between the two dumps as they unearthed and labeled finds.15 It is not clear how long terracottas from these dumps remained above 7 Riva and Vella (2006, 4-14) examined approaches to orientalization in the 20th century. For objections to diffu sionist models, see Purcell 2006, 23-4; van Dommelen 2006, 135-40. Said (1978) heralded postcolonial ways of thinking about East-West relations; see also Osborne 2006,155. Miller's (1997) study of Athenian receptivity to Achaemenid Persian culture in the fifth century shifted the debate by emphasizing accommodation between imperial powers as Greeks appro priated Eastern styles. 8 de Polignac 1984,1994,1995. 9 Haggis et al. (2007, 269-72) summarize what little is known architecturally of archaic Cretan sanctuaries in their identification of B2000 as a cult building at Azoria, a settle ment site in east Crete. Another structure (D900), discovered in 2006, is also identified as a shrine, for it has an altar, hearth, and 14 figurines. 10For this deposit, see Platon 1960,259; Platon and Davaris 1960,512. The popular figurine type of an enthroned goddess is compatible with an interpretation of Demeter or another goddess. Terracotta pigs in this deposit point to the worship of Demeter. However, a single figurine of Artemis appears among the countless generic representations, enough to sug gest that the cult belonged to her or to a close Cretan equiva lent, Britomartis. Another possibility is the worship of Athena Lindia (infra n. 173). 11 Di Vita (1985, 40) mentioned the discovery of a large vo tive deposit marking the position of this sanctuary. Its contents include hundreds of cup bases, terracotta figurines and plaques, and lamps. Figurines include hydrophoroi, a type usually associated with Demeter; see also Sporn 2002,163-65. 12 Forster 1901-1902, 280-81; Halbherr 1901, 385; Sporn 2002, 44; Prent 2005, 306-7. Plaques and figurines include at least 30 varieties from the Orientalizing to Hellenistic periods. 13 Whitley (2001, 136) espoused the traditional view that votives stayed within sacred ground, even if personnel often moved them from their original position or reused them for the fill of later terraces and buildings. Van Straten (1992,272) had no doubts about their inalienability; see also Simon 1986, 172; Linders 1987,115-18; Salapata 2002,31. 14 For a description and plan of this sanctuary, see Cold stream 1973,1-17, fig. 1. A votive deposit from the shrine on the Third Acropolis at Praisos was recovered inside a temenos wall (Bosanquet 1901-1902,255-56, fig. 27). 15 Periodic cleaning and disposal might result in successive deposits of different periods, but most votive dumps at Greek sanctuaries lack stratification, perhaps as a result of infrequent disposal. Sanctuary personnel occasionally distinguished vo</page><page sequence="5">2009] ROUSSA EKKLESIA, PART 1 357 ground on display, nor how they were displayed.16 Most have no preserved suspension hole and may have been unsuitable for hanging.17 Perhaps worshipers placed plaques on portable tables or stands. Decisions regarding cataloguing, conserving, and storing artifacts also have a bearing on this study. Ex cavators did not save everything they found. Papadakis mentions ash and burnt animal bones in the pits, but no samples reached the storeroom shelves.18 Botanical and faunal remains might have revealed clues about sacrificial and dietary practices. Thus, we lack direct ev idence of these activities. Moreover, diagnostic features probably ensured the survival of some artifacts. For example, there are fine ware pottery rims, bases, and handles but no body fragments; coarse and cooking wares are unattested. While the excavators were appar ently scrupulous in saving every identifiable fragment of a terracotta plaque, nothing like a complete sample of what was recovered is now available for study. Excavating a rural sanctuary of the historical Greek period went against the Bronze Age paradigm of Cretan archaeology established by Sir Arthur Evans' spectacular discoveries at Knossos. But this paradigm was not universal?the study of the orientalizing re naissance constituted an important exception to the Knossian emphasis on prehistory.19 Roussa Ekklesia is notably poor compared to other orientalizing sanc tuaries: cheap clay offerings and cult equipment are the only surviving expressions of religious veneration, with no trace of bronze, ivory, or other precious mate rials. Despite their low profile, the finds from the site have implications for terracotta production in east Crete. British excavations at Praisos at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries revealed idiosyncratic tradi tions for figurines and architectural terracottas, and these made an impression on classicists familiar with Herodotus and later authors who considered the ques tion of Eteocretan identity.20 With the discovery of the first undeciphered Eteocretan inscription at Praisos in 1884, this polis came to be regarded as a preserve of traditional institutions and a people who closed ranks in the face of the Dorian invasion and other distur bances. Although this picture of Eteocretan insularity has fallen out of favor as historians have reassessed ethnic claims and the process of stylistic diffusion, the Eteocretan issue still frames discussions of archaic art at Praisos and other east Cretan sites. TERRACOTTA PLAQUES Moldmade terracotta plaques provide the earliest evidence for cult activity at Roussa Ekklesia and add to our knowledge of craft traditions in east Crete. The catalogue documents 151 examples, although the fragmentary condition of most makes it difficult to go beyond assigning a piece to a particular category (see appx.). Even the fragments, however, merit scrutiny, since they occasionally document previously unknown types or help settle iconographic questions connected with better-known plaques. Also, documenting the fre quency of artifacts can reveal shifts in the popularity of votive types and changes in religious practice. Fabric The characteristic fabric of most terracottas ranges from reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/6) to pale brown (10YR 7/4), varying from this by only a few steps on the color chart (fig. 3). The clay is generally fine and compact, and many examples preserve a fine slip on the mold tives by material. E.g., at the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Axos, they consigned metal and clay votives to two separate dumps. Other evidence of careful disposal is a votive deposit from Spartan Amyklai, in which plaques were found stacked upside down, surrounded by pots arranged by shape (Salapata 2002, 31). Only one Cretan terracotta, an anthropomorphic figu rine, was found in its original location, on a bench at Pachlit zani Agriada, near Azoria (Prent 2005, 299-300). 16 Cretan sanctuaries rarely have preserved accommoda tions for displaying votives. An exception is the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Gortyn, where a terraced area outside the tem ple may have been a display ground for votives, including met al and clay offerings (D'Acunto 2002, 190-92). At open-air sanctuaries, worshipers may have hung offerings from bush es and trees, as has been suggested for the clay plaques from Penteskouphia, Corinth. Van Straten (1992, 248-52, 271) and Salapata (2002, 26-31) discuss provisions for hanging and displaying votives, as well as sanctuary rules governing placement. In addition, Pausanias (2.13.4) relates that pris oners seeking asylum at the Sanctuary of Hebe at Phlius hung their fetters in the trees of the sacred grove. 17 Only one plaque (cat. no. 146) from Roussa Ekklesia has a preserved hole. Whitley (1998, 37, fig. 2.11) illustrated an example from Praisos (Herakleion Archaeological Museum, inv. no. 1249) with two small suspension holes; it is the same type as our male votary plaques. According to Salapata (2002, 28, fig. 6), these hole configurations are suitable for hanging the plaques rather than nailing them to a flat surface. 18Papadakis (pers. comm. 1998) was not specific about the animal species represented in the deposit. 19 According to Alcock (2002, 99), Evans' discoveries "set Cretan archaeology on a prehistoric path." Papadopoulos (2005, 101-10) connected the appeal of Evans' Minoan con struct to emerging European identity. The neglect of post Bronze Age Cretan history and archaeology began to change in the 1990s. Kirsten (1942) and Demargne (1947) are nota ble exceptions, as is Coldstream (1973), whose publication of the Sanctuary of Demeter at Knossos helped establish Knossos as a type-site for historical Crete. 20Ath. 9.37a; Hdt. 7.172-73; Horn. Od. 19.172-81; Strabo 10.4.6-12.

Dreros is the only other site with monumental Eteocretan inscriptions.</page><page sequence="6">358 BRICE ERICKSON [AJA 113 1 37 87 103 145 Fig. 3. Plaque types and fabric colors from Roussa Ekklesia (cat. nos. 1, 37, 87, 103, 145). ed surface. This slip is generally the same color as the fabric or a shade or two lighter. Plaques made from the same mold and presumably of the same date and place of manufacture can vary slightly in fabric color, suggesting different firing conditions. In addition, post-depositional factors had noticeable effects on fabric hardness and consistency. Moist soil reduced the worst fragments to lumps of soft, chalky clay. The only identifiable inclusions under a lOx hand lens are small white calcite fragments and reddish-brown mineral particles (max. diam. 0.1 cm). Unfortunately, the observed inclusions and clay characteristics do not match any fabric profiles of east Crete.21 Scientific analysis is needed to distinguish fabric groups and de termine the sources of raw materials involved in the production of these terracottas. While most plaques fall within this range in fabric color, consistency, and inclusions, there are important exceptions. Three of the earliest on stylistic grounds (cat. nos. 1-3) exhibit a completely different fabric: a red clay (between 5YR 7/6 and 7/8) with a coarse, gritty consistency and large mineral inclusions (max. diam. 0.8 cm). They stand apart from the others icon ographically as well (fig. 4). The first two fragments depict a wig of hair culminating in a single strand on each shoulder, with arms at the side and elbows bent. It is not clear whether the subjects were clothed. Also unparalleled is the preserved lower section of cata logue number 3, a dress flaring at the bottom with straight folds in an inverted-V pattern beginning from the waist. These three terracottas may derive from a different production center. Goddess xuith High Polos This is a local version of a type commonly found at Cretan sanctuaries in the seventh century (cat. nos. 4-97). It depicts a female nude in a frontal pose, her arms at her sides and hands flush with her thighs. The hairstyle is distinctive: two locks hang over each shoul der and extend down to the breasts.22 According to Jenkins' classification of Daedalic representations, the high, narrow waist of our examples points to a date in the third quarter of the seventh century.23 While a high crown (the polos) adorns our subject, few published 21 For summaries of fabric studies in east Crete, see Jones 1986, 54-6; Haggis and Mook 1993, 270-71; Haggis 2005, 44-5; Day et al. 2006, 137-39. Most investigations of Cretan clay sources have focused on Bronze Age production, with the exception of Knossos. In addition, other direct evidence for production has been slow in coming for historical sites. For instance, no excavated kiln dates within the period ca. 600-400, although the discovery at Knossos of two examples on either side of this chronological range provides useful in formation (Hasaki 2002, 338, 360-61). Little is known about historical clay sources and fabric groups from the Siteia dis trict, although the Praisos survey team is currently working on a typology for wares recovered around the urban center. The Hierapytna isthmus, the neighboring district to Siteia, is known for differences in raw materials and technological traditions, at least in the Bronze Age (Day et al. 2006, 144). Without scientific studies of historical clay sources, Moody et al. (2003, 38-44) recommend macroscopic analysis of fabrics as a first step to identification. 22 Divided locks are an early alternative to the more com mon Cretan layer wig. Both divided locks and the layer wig set Cretan representations apart from Syrian prototypes with Hathor hairstyles (Marinatos 2000,27). 23Jenkins 1936, pis. 4,5; see also Boardman 1961,109. The only way to date these plaques is by figural style. Although an inscribed plaque of related type from Praisos can be dated on letter forms to the seventh century, this merely confirms the dating of the Roussa Ekklesia plaques in broad outline. For</page><page sequence="7">2009] ROUSSA EKKLESIA, PART 1 359 Fig. 4. Early terracotta plaques from Roussa Ekklesia (cat. nos. 1-3) (C. Papanikolopoulos). examples have such a high headdress. Plaques from an idendcal mold, however, came to light at Vavelli, a spring sanctuary near Praisos, and Lapsanari, another spring sanctuary southwest of Siteia (fig. 5).24 Most examples from Roussa Ekklesia are from one or two molds or the same number of identical sets (figs. 6-8), although minor differences distinguish plaques from at least two other sources. Heads with hair oudined in an oval around the face leaving a patch below the polos (fig. 9 [86-9]) come from a different mold than do catalogue numbers 4-85. Another type has a round, shallow face and an elaborate polos with two rows of flamelike triangles at the bottom (see fig. 9 [90-5]). Vavelli has produced identical plaques to these; they are less common than the main type, just as at Roussa Ekklesia.25 From Vavelli comes another parallel for a fourth type that appears only once at Roussa Ekklesia (see fig. 9 [96]): a nude without a polos whose locks of hair divide at the shoulder.26 An unparalleled plaque (see fig. 9 [97]) depicts a deity with high polos and hair arranged in a more conven tional layer wig swept back behind the shoulders. She wears a cape and a long dress.27 Enough survives of this eroded plaque to identify the subject as a kouro Fig. 5. Terracotta plaque from Vavelli depicting a nude goddess with a high polos (?

The inscription may be Eteocretan (Duhoux 1982, 119-21, fig. 33). 24 For Vavelli, see Halbherr 1901, 385-86, pis. 10.1, 10.2; Dohan 1931, 220, fig. 25. For Lapsanari, see Prent 2005, 302. Identical plaques in the British Museum came from the vicin ity of Praisos (Higgins 1954,160, pi. 76, nos. 585-87). In addi tion, B?hm (1990, 170, pi. 28, nos. TK85, TK86) catalogued examples from the Praisos area. 25 Dohan 1931, 220, fig. 23. A goddess from Lato wears a polos with a similar chevron pattern (Demargne 1929, 394, fig. 10). 26Dohan 1931, fig. 24. B?hm (1990,172, pi. 29, no. TK98) incorrectly identified this plaque as coming from Chamaizi, a Bronze Age site on the coastal plain of Siteia. 27 Similar plaques from the Siteia votive deposit show more clearly a figure with an exposed breast suckling an infant. Our plaque may be related to these, although it is not from the same mold and the different fabric suggests a different pro duction center. Figurines from Axos suggest an alternative to the suckling infant; a common type at the Sanctuary of Aph rodite depicts a woman cradling a rabbit (Rizza 1967-1968, 252-56, fig. 21, nos. 130-35).</page><page sequence="8">360 BRICE ERICKSON [AJA 113 l 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 ^j^^^^ ' 20 ' ' 21 ' 22 23 Fig. 6.

Unlike the Near Eastern proto types for the kourotrophos, the Cretan figures are always clothed.28 Plaques depicting a frontal nude have figured heav ily in discussions of orientalization on Crete, for they reveal a clear connection to Near Eastern conven tions. Indeed, these plaques are almost inexplicable without reference to the Levant, for female nudity is a convention seldom used by Greek artists after the eighth century, except to represent maenads, nymphs, and violated mortals (e.g., Kassandra). Only in the fourth century does nudity again become appropriate for goddesses elsewhere in Greece, with the Knidian Aphrodite of Praxiteles.29 In the Near East, however, female nudity was a long-established convention and served many functions, including an emphasis on sexuality and human fertility. Goddesses depicted as nudes include Mesopotamian Ishtar, Syrian As tar te, and Ugaritic Anat. Although the Cretan plaques are often described as Astarte in type, it is impossible to specify the deity. Attributes such as wings and tiaras perhaps differentiated Near Eastern goddesses, but the simple nudes of Cretan art lack any such attributes. They resemble another Near Eastern type with rigid poses and hands at the side; these nudes occasionally flank goddesses and seem to be sacred consorts, guard ians, and mediators, similar to the nymphs and minor fertility deities of later Greek mythology. These plaques, however, did not necessarily have the same meaning on Crete as they did elsewhere. Did Cretans use the type to portray divinities? Wickert Micknat and B?hm criticized earlier identifications of these figures as "Aphrodites" as misguided attempts to relate the iconography of Cretan terracottas to the Homeric pantheon.30 They also doubted the classifica tion of these nudes as goddesses. Subjects with a po los, however, are difficult to interpret as humans.31 As O'Brien demonstrated for archaic images of Hera, an elaborate polos can signify divine status without being a consistent attribute.32 The high polos of catalogue numbers 4?89 and the decorated version of catalogue numbers 90-5 are as elaborate as any headdress in the Cretan plaque maker's repertoire. In addition, nudity seems more appropriate for a goddess than a human priestess or votary. Nudes plausibly identified as god desses appear in other media, whereas subjects iden tified as mortal women are always shown clothed in archaic Cretan bronzes, sculptural reliefs, and painted pots.33 The terracotta plaques almost certainly depict a divinity, although not necessarily the canonical image of a goddess. As Budin observed, these nudes violate Greek standards of propriety and should be read as symbols of an exotic, other world.34 "Orientalizing" is a proper term for these plaques: not only do they express close stylistic affinities with Near Eastern models but the wide diffusion of the basic type and the sheer number at some Cretan sanctuaries point to an appetite for Levantine motifs on religious occasions.35 It is unclear, however, how Near Eastern archetypes reached Crete and whether the transmis sion involved styles alone or people as well as styles. For Ridgway, the impetus for Cretan production came from foreign craftsmen who established workshops for luxury goods on the island.36 She envisioned a trickle down effect as the style spread from exotic imports to cheap terracottas. Others, however, have expressed 28For B?hm (1990,136-37), the clothed kourotrophos on Crete emphasized nursing and motherhood while suppress ing erotic aspects of the divinity. 29 As Stewart (1997, 101) observed, these nudes ignore an important standard of behavior for Greek women: that of ai dos. He distinguished them from an early Greek convention in which men and women were depicted naked and also from the more familiar male nudes and clothed females of the Clas sical period (Stewart 1997, 39-40). Budin (2003, 31-2) listed the few exceptions to clothed women in the Archaic and Clas sical periods. For nude depictions of Kassandra and women in marginal roles at the symposium, see Cohen 1992-1993, 41. 30Wickert-Micknat 1982,110; B?hm 1990,125-26. Stewart (1997, 101), however, was inclined to interpret these Cretan figures as goddesses in the Olympian pantheon, including Aphrodite, Hera, Artemis, and Athena. 31 Most observers have identified these Cretan nudes with a polos as divinities (M?ller 1915; Cassimatis 1982, 459; Am merman 1991, 204; Budin 2003, 64 n. 91). B?hm (1990, 87) is the main dissenter. 32 O'Brien (1993, 32-3, 138) compared the polos of an archaic wooden statuette from the Samian Heraion to nu mismatic and literary depictions of cult statues with similar headgear. The statuette from the Heraion wears a polos al most one-quarter the total height of the figure, a ratio compa rable to the best-preserved plaques at Roussa Ekklesia. 33 For nudes interpreted as goddesses in heraldic composi tions with flanking animals, see infra n. 105. Clothed subjects depicted on the Prinias reliefs spin wool and engage in other activities appropriate for mortals (Lebessi 1976,175-76). For women in Cretan pot painting, see Boardman 1998, 112, pi. 269. 34Budin 2003, 64 n. 91. Canonical images of Cretan god desses may have had some traits in common with the nude terracottas. E.g., the bronze statuettes from the Early Iron Age temple at Dreros are among the best candidates on Crete for cult images, and the two female subjects are clothed and wear a polos. For the identification of the statuettes as cult images, see Alroth 1989,18; Sj?gren 2003, 52. 35Prent (2005,405, tables 6, 7) documented 26 sites on the island with similar plaques. 36 According to Ridgway (1993, 25), mass production of teracottas allowed the new style to spread quickly, but exotic imports such as large-scale wooden statues were the first links in the chain. Although the putative wooden models have not survived, limestone sculpture at Gortyn documents the same types and styles as seen in the terracottas.</page><page sequence="13">2009] ROUSSA EKKLESIA, PART 1 365 doubts about resident craftsmen and foreign work shops. Their doubts are grounded as much in opposi tion to diffusionist arguments for stylistic change as in reassessments of the archaeological evidence for im migrants on Crete.37 A diffusionist explanation positing Near Eastern craftsmen on the island might be more convincing if imported archetypes were documented at only a few sites, and these could be identified as the points of origin for the local style. But this is not the pattern on Crete, where no imported plaques have come to light, and the taste for Levantine motifs ap pears to be widespread. The perspective of hybridization may provide a better understanding of this interaction, with clearly hybrid figurines from prehistoric Cyprus helping to explain the more ambiguous Cretan plaques. Syrian figurines enter the Cypriot repertoire in Middle Cy cladic (MC) III to Late Cycladic (LC) I, a period of close contact between the two areas. But local plaque makers also created new types by combining Aegean and Syrian elements; the use of paint, the more human appearance of the face, and the flat head constituted an attempt to "Aegeanize" the more avian style of the Near Eastern figurines.38 The result is a hybrid style characterized by negotiations between cultures, with porous boundaries giving rise to new meanings, rather than a hierarchical relationship between parent cul ture and borrower. Hybridization can take place with out immigrant craftsmen through less intense forms of contact such as trade.39 Commercial relations between Crete and the Levant in the eighth and seventh centu ries would have exposed Cretans to new artistic styles and ideas, but this does not mean that they imported Astarte or a foreign representation in some pure form. Indeed, attempts to trace the Cretan "Astarte" plaques to a Near Eastern model have not succeeded; even the putative source area cannot be determined.40 On Crete, local consumption of small trade goods from different regions could have inspired adapta tions, leading to a new style. If this style spread through local initiative, one way the industry could have sus tained itself was through second-generation molds from earlier Cretan plaques, cannibalization resulting in smaller but otherwise identical products.41 Deriva tives of other Cretan plaques mark another step away from Near Eastern archetypes.42 Perhaps islanders later drew on imported designs for variety, as Dohan proposed in 1931 for unusual plaques at Vavelli and Roussa Ekklesia, whose idiosyncratic features sug gested a mishandled and poorly understood foreign model.43 But if imports occasionally refreshed local stocks, they did not lead to new directions in what had become established local industries by ca. 650. Male Votary Unlike the nude goddesses, the male votary plaque is a local type found almost exclusively at sanctuaries in the Praisos region (cat. nos. 98-142) (fig. 10). The only suggestion of Near Eastern borrowing is the un broken mass of hair marked by horizontal grooves in a Daedalic manner, but this hairstyle may have reached Crete through other sources. The subject stands in profile to the left, dressed in a belted, calf-length tu nic. The body is short in relation to the head, and the rounded surfaces of the chest, shoulder, and buttocks create an effective profile denoting an advanced stage 37Dunbabin (1957,40) was among the first to stress foreign craftsmen as facilitators in the Cretan reception of Near East ern styles. Hoffman's (1997,1-17,160-65) revisionist account of the orientalizing phenomenon accepts the central premise that Near Eastern inspiration underlies Cretan achievements but subjects claims for resident craftsmen to greater scrutiny. Budin (2003, 191-96) also favors a commercial explanation for Near Eastern influences on Crete, with Cyprus as an inter mediary. New evidence from Eleutherna, however, points to Phoenician burials in the cemetery of Orthi Petra (Stampo lidis and Kotsonas 2006, 352-55; see also Sj?gren 2008, 106 15). This topic plays into larger issues of East-West relations (Burkert 1992, 21-5; West 1997, 2-12). 38 Budin (2003, 145) augmented Badre's (1980) study of the Syrian figurines and placed the Cypriot examples in the context of cultural interactions between East and West, con nections also seen in glyptic art and architectural styles. For hybridization theory in prehistoric Cypriot archaeology more generally, see Knapp 2008,57-61. 39 E.g., at Corinth, foreign religious ideas, such as that ex pressed by a fifth-century Corinthian cup inscribed with the name of the Phoenician goddess Astarte, may have arrived with traders responsible for imports of western Punic ampho ras containing salted fish (Williams 1986,13-14). 40 B?hm (1990, 107-16, 120-21) excluded on stylistic grounds a transfer point through Cyprus. Others, however, have pointed to Cyprus as an intermediary in the transfer of mold technology used in making the plaques at Roussa Ekkle sia and other Cretan sanctuaries (Riis 1963; Miller 1985, 10 12; Ammerman 1991, 208-9). Yet mold production did not require much expertise, and if there was anything resembling a transfer of Near Eastern technology to Crete, it probably oc curred in the final quarter of the eighth or first quarter of the seventh century, long before the Roussa Ekklesia plaques. 41Nicholls (1952, 219-21) defined a series as terracottas from the same mold. A derivative series is one fashioned from a new mold using a terracotta from the earlier series as a pro totype. Classical archaeologists have encountered as many as five generations of molds, each series having progressively smaller examples; see also Miller 1985, 10-11; Ammerman 1991,214; Salapata2002,24. 42As Nicholls (1952, 225) remarked, substantial reworking of a derivative mold can result in a new generation of plaques so transformed as to pass as a different series. 43Dohan 1931, 220.</page><page sequence="14">366 BRICE ERICKSON [AJA 113 Fig. 10.

For Boardman, the decisive feature for dating is the head, with its low forehead and flat top; these details suggest a date ca. 630-600, as for the griffin and sphinx heads discussed below.44 A shifting mold during production created some minor distor tions, including elongated feet, a double ground line, and exaggerated thumbs.45 Since the first publication of plaques of this type from the Vavelli deposit at Praisos, confusion about the sex, pose, and attributes of the figure has led to different identifications, including a goddess, a female votary, a charioteer, a youth with a staff, and a temple boy.46 Although fragmentary, the 45 examples from Roussa Ekklesia can create a composite image of un precedented clarity (fig. 11). A few of these plaques clearly came from the same mold, not just the same mold series. For example, catalogue numbers 99,126, 128, and 130 preserve the same faint crack in the left field below the waist (fig. 12). Worn plaques of the same size but without this defect are not necessar ily from a different mold. But five plaques (cat. nos. 138-42), with no more than an outline of the figure, are from at least one other mold, for they are approxi mately 12% smaller than the rest (fig. 13). A new clay mold taken from one of the larger plaques would be expected to shrink this much in the kiln, producing a new generation of smaller plaques.47 Is the subject of these plaques male or female? The calf-length garment resembles feminine dress, yet the short hair seems to be a masculine fashion. Recent 44Boardman (1961, 110) dated these plaques later than Dohan (1931,216) and others, who favored a date in the first half of the seventh century. I find Boardman's arguments for a later date persuasive. 45Boardman (1961,110) attributed other unexplained fea tures to a shifting mold. E.g., where Forster (1904-1905, 247) discerned the border of a chlamys, Boardman (1961,110) saw a double outline of the shoulder. But all examples have this feature?surely the mold did not shift every time. 4,i Proposals include Halbherr 1901, 389, pi. 12; Forster 1904-1905,247; Poulsen 1912,147, fig. 172;Dohan 1931,215 16, figs. 10-12; Higgins 1954,159, pi. 76, nos. 582-84; Mollard Besques 1954,30-1, pi. 22, nos.

Papanikolopoulos). work on hairstyle as a gender and age marker in ear lier Aegean contexts, however, complicates any simple equation of hair length with masculine and feminine identity. For Davis, different hairstyles from prehistoric wall paintings signal different ritual stages for boys and girls.48 In seventh-century Cretan art, males with long hair down to the middle of the back?often separat ed into locks tied near the ends?appear to be older adolescents.49 Bearded adults have shorter hair, either arranged in thin strands reaching the shoulder or a mass level with the chin. While much of the evidence comes from bronze plaques and engraved armor, terra cotta figurines from the Siteia deposit also permit a distinction between a shoulder-length Daedalic wig for women and an otherwise identical chin-length style for bearded men. Short hair without a beard may be appropriate for young men.50 The hairstyle of the Roussa Ekklesia plaques thus suggests a young adult male. But, with few Cretan parallels for a male subject wearing such a long garment, Higgins drew on main land Greek iconography and saw in the long dress the outfit of a charioteer.51 Charioteers are not unknown in the orientalizing Cretan repertoire. For example, clay plaques from Siteia depict a charioteer accompanied by a goddess. But the Siteia charioteer wears a different garment, short in the front with a long tail.52 As with hairstyles, different dress can signal gen der and age distinctions. As Boardman observed, the stitched or fringed borders of the tunic are compara ble (at least above the waist) to the costumes of some men bringing animals to sacrifice in bronze plaques now recognized as offerings at Kato Syme.53 A few plaques show adolescent boys with long hair in the company of older, bearded men; both wear the same 48 Davis 1986. 49 Long hair as a sign of late adolescence is not uniquely Cretan. One of Apollo's oldest epithets (Horn. 77. 20.39) is akersekomas, "with unshorn hair" (Burkert 1985, 145). Leitao (2003, 110-20) examined performative aspects and gender implications of hair growing and cutting rituals in ancient Greece; see also Langdon 2008,148. 50Koehl (2000, 135-37, fig. 11.1), who observed that hair styles often symbolize different stages of initiation in classical Greece, drew on Minoan iconography to propose nine dif ferent hairstyles corresponding to different male and female age grades. Short hair is most prominent in rituals of sepa ration and incorporation into citizen ranks. In this Minoan sequence, only the waist-length tresses of late adolescence re semble a hairstyle known from the seventh century. The chin length hairstyle of the Roussa Ekklesia plaques has no Minoan parallel. 51Higgins (1954, 159; 1967, 28) believed that the hands held reins that were painted and have since disappeared. Mainland Greece has produced examples of long male dress, such as a corselet from Olympia, long thought to be Cretan, which depicts Apollo wearing an elaborate, calf-length tunic with pattern decoration and stitching. This costume is clearly distinguishable from the dress of Leto and Themis (Board man 1961, 142, fig. 55c). Hoffmann (1972, 50-2, pi. 25a-c), however, preferred a Peloponnesian origin for this corselet based on stylistic discrepancies with armor from Crete. 52 For the Siteia deposit, see Papadakis 1980; Prent 2005, 300-1; Zografaki 2006. In addition, an early Orientalizing hydria from Kavousi depicts a bearded charioteer with chin length hair who is dressed in a short tunic (Tsipopoulou 2005, 113). There is little reason to think that plaque makers and pot painters on the island adopted the mainland convention of a long, tight-fitting costume for their charioteers, although an architectural relief from the temple at Palaikastro depicts a charioteer in mainland dress (Bosanquet 1904-1905, 300-3, pi. 15; Hutchinson 1939-1940,41, pi. 17). 53Boardman 1961,110.</page><page sequence="17">2009] ROUSSA EKKLESIA, PART 1 369 tunic with a tight belt and prominent stitching along the shoulders and sleeves (fig. 14). Their short dress barely covers the buttocks and tapers in front, leaving the genitals partially exposed. Other masculine cos tumes include a mantle draped around the shoulders, a long cape, and a covering for the buttocks. If the long dress of the Roussa Ekklesia plaques is another option for ritual occasions, as suggested by the simi lar construction methods and decorative borders, its message probably differed from the more revealing costumes of the Kato Syme bronzes or the nudity of the youth depicted on other plaques at Roussa Ekklesia (cat. nos. 147-50). Perhaps the long tunic and short hair of these plaques marks the transition to manhood, whereas the bronzes depict not this stage but either older adolescents or mature men. Although garment length roughly correlates with gender (women wear much longer dress, down to their ankles), front and rear coverage was another consideration for masculine costume at Kato Syme. The exposed penis and covered buttocks of the bronzes can be explained in terms of gendered stereotypes of active and passive sexual roles given prominence in pederastic relationships.54 Boardman suggested that the male subject of the Roussa Ekklesia plaques held in his right hand a painted staff.55 Yet there is no sign of painting on any plaques from Vavelli or Roussa Ekklesia, and it is doubtful that their makers would have taken the trouble to paint a detail so easily rendered in the mold when they had no difficulty producing thin ground lines and borders.56 According to Pilz, the clenched hand with thumb over index finger resembles a gesture of prayer known from Neo-Hittite and Assyrian sourc es.57 I propose another explanation: a youth offering a flower. This might explain the pose, for dedicants with flowers occasionally hold them near the head, as if savoring the smell, as on a seventh-century plaque from a site on the Lasithi plateau.58 A small figure of Fig. 14. Bronze cutout plaque depicting a youth and adult male. Paris, Musee du Louvre, inv. no. MNC 689 (H. Lewan dowski; ? Reunion des Musees Nationaux/Art Resource, NY). about the same date on a limestone relief from Prinias also holds such a flower.59 He is dressed in much the same way as the subject of the Roussa Ekklesia plaques, in a calf-length tunic with a fringed lower hem. This depiction not only confirms the gender and age as sociations of long tunics but also shows that flowers r&gt;4 As Dover (1989, 205) observed, both the youth and ma ture man wear the same short tunic, while only the genitals of the youth are exposed. For Cretan age groups and gendered concepts of active and passive sex roles, see Leitao 1995,138. 55Boardman 1961,110. r,&lt;iThe other examples cited by Salapata (2002, 22) for plaques with painted details (horse reins and lyre strings) have molded guidelines for these features. 57 Pilz (forthcoming [b]) compared the plaques from Prai sos to a Neo-Hittite relief from Zincirli and a Neo-Assyrian cy lindrical seal from the Samian Heraion. The subjects of both Near Eastern depictions have clenched hands, but the poses differ in each case. 58 Although divinities in archaic Greek art occasionally hold flowers and pomegranates, a different pose with an out stretched arm and open palm distinguishes them from mor tals (Keesling 2003, 149-61). Rouse (1902, 84, 288-90, 304) listed male and female subjects holding flowers. The figure of the Roussa Ekklesia plaques resembles a male votary in re pousse on gold and silver plates from the Sanctuary of De meter at Mesembria (Van Straten 1981, 82, fig. 7). For the plaque from Hagios Georgios Papoura (Lasithi), see Board man 1961,109,115, pi. 39, no. 498. 59Lebessi (1976, 23-4, 75,175, pis. 6, 7, no. A5) identified him as a youth bidding farewell to a warrior, perhaps his fa ther. Another explanation is that this youth with short hair is an eromenos. A warrior and eromenos would have mainland Greek parallels. E.g., the story of Cleomachus, who died fight ing for Chalcis in the Lelantine War, emphasizes the tragic potential of the relationship, with an eromenos sending the doomed Cleomachus into battle with a kiss. A version of this story is attested as early as ca. 500 (Younger 2005, 33).</page><page sequence="18">370 BRICE ERICKSON [AJA 113 were as suitable an offering in Cretan art as they were in the archaic Greek repertoire.60 What Higgins and Boardman understood to be a de fect in the mold below the left elbow of some plaques is instead a detail present in every published example from museum collections and all but the most eroded fragments from Roussa Ekklesia.61 This is probably not an accidental crack but a pertinent detail, an attri bute. A small spherical object attached by a thin loop around the forearm hangs below the elbow. This loop merges with a band above the elbow, presumably the hem of the sleeve. Some fragments (cat. nos. 101,115, 126-28) show another cord connecting the spherical object to the dress. What is this object? One candidate is a globular aryballos perfume jar suspended from the arm and attached to the body with a stay. In mainland Greece, the aryballos was a potent symbol evoking the world of male athletics, beauty, and the palaestra.62 It also acquired a ritual significance as a token of youth relinquished at the transition to manhood.63 Oil con tainers may have conveyed similar meanings on Crete. In the eastern part of the island, aryballoi of Corin thian type but local manufacture begin appearing in tombs at the end of the eighth century.64 In addition, Corinthian aryballoi in lavish tombs of young men at Aphrati suggest that perfume was a prestige good and the container a symbol of male identity, for these pots occasionally appear in the same tombs with bronze urns and other objects of high intrinsic value and elite associations.65 Scented oil also may have played a role in religious rites at Olous, where Corinthian aryballoi and exaleiptra appear in an archaic and classical votive deposit. At Praisos, at least one globular Corinthian aryballos was reported from a tomb.66 But oil contain ers were not left as dedications at Praisos, Vavelli, or Roussa Ekklesia. Griffin and Sphinx Three plaques at Roussa Ekklesia depict a griffin in profile, facing right (fig. 15 [143-45]). This type dis plays a fusion of Near Eastern and mainland Greek elements, resulting in a Cretan hybrid of the same stripe as the male votaries. Boardman's discussion of griffins and related plaques of sphinxes on the island reveals a complex process of borrowing from Near Eastern and mainland Greek sources.67 The earliest Cretan sphinxes in bronze, dated to the eighth cen tury, follow the conventions of Near Eastern bronzes, having the same profile heads, helmets, and straight edged wings. The fragmentary plaques depicting grif fins from Roussa Ekklesia, however, belong to a later type from a terracotta workshop that also produced sphinxes with a frontal Daedalic head and a polos inspired by the Astarte plaques. By combining Near Eastern influences from two sources, Cretan plaque makers created something new. The influence of proto-Corinthian pot painting also can be detected in the long, broad feathers and sickle wings of these 60 The meaning of flowers as offerings depends on the sta tus of the giver and receiver and the type of flower. E.g., depic tions of girls carrying roses at the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Corinth can evoke either the mythological abduction of Persephone in marriage or the worship of Aphrodite, as the rose is sacred to her (Merker 2000,125). 61 Higgins 1954, 159; Boardman 1961, 115-16. Halbherr (1901, 389, pi. 12) also regarded this as a defect in the mold, for his drawings omit any sign of it. The Oxford example is suspect because it was taken from a shifting mold. According to Horst (2001,221, pi. 34), all plaques of this type from Lato, even those from first-generation molds, have the supposed crack under the left elbow. Lato has produced a few other plaques in common with Roussa Ekklesia and Praisos (Board man 1961, 113). There may have been a special connection between these sites. 62 For the funerary associations of oil containers with males, see Kurtz and Boardman 1971,208. Shanks (1999,174), how ever, connected Corinthian perfume with the world of women based on ancient literary conventions and structuralist theo ry. His argument ignores representational evidence and ar chaeological context. E.g., the only Corinthian aryballos from the Pantanello necropolis in the territory of Metaponto came from the tomb of an adult male, with age and sex determined by skeletal remains (Carter and Hall 1998, 361, no. T276). 63According to Merker (2000, 335), an inscribed aryballos depicting a chorus of nude boys from the Temple of Apollo at Corinth confirms the traditional association of the shape with initiation rituals. In addition, a class of figurines from the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore and the Asklepieion at Corinth depicts nude youths with either an aryballos, a lyre, or a knucklebone bag (Merker 2000, 61, 334-35). 64Tsipopoulou's (2005,555) work on Early Iron Age ceram ic traditions in east Crete documents local and Corinthian oil containers from elite contexts. 65 A globular Corinthian aryballos from Pithos 81 came from a burial rich in ceramic offerings, including a decorated basin serving as an ash urn (Levi 1927-1929, 151, fig. 153). More lavish burials with bronze vessels also contain Corinthi an perfume pots or local equivalents (Levi 1927-1929,99, fig. 74 [Pithos 19]; 128, fig. Ill [Pithos 52]; 306, fig. 406 [Tomb M]). Another sign of Corinthian influence comes in an in digenous black-figure pottery style at Aphrati (Boardman 1961, 145). Elsewhere on Crete, Stampolidis (1996, 49, nos. 13, 14) published several Corinthian oil jars from the Orthi Petra cemetery at Eleutherna. There are also Cretan copies of globular aryballoi from unpublished tombs at Kydonia and Phalasarna in the Chania Archaeological Museum. 66Bosanquet 1901-1902, 243; Marshall 1905-1906, 64. A different Corinthian oil container, the exaleiptron, appeared in other tombs at Praisos (Tsipopoulou 1987, 272-75). 67 Boardman (1961, 110-11) augmented Dohan's (1931, 222-23, figs. 33-8) study of sphinxes in Cretan art.</page><page sequence="19">2009] ROUSSA EKKLESIA, PART 1 371 later griffins and sphinxes.68 Boardman relied on these and other stylistic details to date the sphinxes and related griffin plaques to ca. 630-600.69 The grif fins from Roussa Ekklesia undoubtedly came from the same mold series as the plaques from Vavelli and a site on Lasithi, discussed by Boardman. A sphinx from Lapsanari also seems to be from the same workshop.70 In addition, a votive deposit from Hagios Georgios, near Praisos, has produced an identical griffin with a pendent sphinx created from the same flat board of clay.71 A single workshop was almost certainly respon sible for both plaques. The only sphinx from Roussa Ekklesia is a different type than these (cat. no. 146); it is a fragment corresponding to a nearly intact Prai sian plaque in the Louvre.72 Its head is comparable to that of the male votary, with a prominent nose and modeled eye, ear, and chin, but it substitutes a sim pler mass of chin-length hair for the Daedalic wig of the other. This sphinx wears a headdress with a flat section crowning the forehead.73 The modeling of the face points to a date ca. 630-600. Warrior Abducting Youth Four fragments derive from a plaque illustrating a warrior with a helmet, breastplate, corselet, hoplite shield, and spear, striding to the right and abducting a youth (fig. 16[147-50]). Stylistically, the plaque(s) to which these fragments belong seem at home in the sixth century. The outline of the spare faces, the pro portions of the two bodies, and the overlapping forms (arms and legs) have been likened to sixth-century pot paintings. The plaque maker has rendered the inside of the shield in shallow relief against the higher plane of the warrior's chest and right leg, giving an illusion of depth. For all these reasons, Dohan dated similar plaques from Vavelli to the middle of the sixth century (fig. 17).74 Another plaque of this type on display in the Hagios Nikolaos Archaeological Museum was dis covered at Hagios Georgios. Very close to these in style is another fragment from Roussa Ekklesia depicting a warrior at rest with his legs crossed and shield hanging from his back (see fig. 16 [ 151 ]). It should also date to the second or third quarter of the sixth century. (*Boardman 1961, 111.

Terracotta plaques from Roussa Ekklesia depict ing warriors abducting youths (cat. nos. 147-50) and one depicting a warrior at rest (cat. no. 151) (C. Papa nikolopoulos). Given how rarely sixth-century Cretan artists de picted armor and weapons, it is worth dwelling on this seemingly realistic depiction of a hoplite (see fig. 17). The close-fitting helmet with fore-and-aft crest resembles many seventh-century specimens offered as dedications at sanctuaries.75 Although miniature hoplite shields appear as votives in the seventh cen tury, full-scale versions with metal attachments such as the arm band included here have left no trace.76 Our warrior has his lower abdomen unprotected without the mitra (a semicircular plate suspended beneath a cuirass or belt) so often found in religious contexts. Since mitral do not appear in representational art of the seventh century, when actual armor was popular as a votive, we need not expect this protective gear to be a subject of a sixth-century plaque. Cretans may have stopped using mitrai in the sixth century, although at Fig. 17. Terracotta plaques depicting a warrior abducting a youth: left, composite drawing of Roussa Ekklesia fragments (drawing byj. Griffin); right, example from Vavelli (?

What meaning did this scene have? Halbherr and Rouse identified the subject as a war captive, which would make the plaque a realistic de piction of the victor's spoils on an occasion such as the sack of a city.78 This explanation, however, has dif ficulty reconciling iconography with a religious role. Are we to imagine a soldier celebrating a victory with an image of a subjugated boy or girl? Although hu man plunder was a reality of Greek military life, it did not receive divine sanction except indirectly as tithes and through captives dedicated as temple slaves.79 Mythological interpretations are also unconvincing. 75 As inferred from fastenings, Cretan helmet crests from the Aphrati hoard were of the fore-and-aft type. Hoffmann (1972, 2, 17) distinguished two types: an open-face helmet similar to our example and a more distinctive Cretan type with an applied frondet and cutout for the face. One of the warriors from the Prinias reliefs wears a Corinthian helmet with a fore-and-aft attachment similar to the Roussa Ekklesia plaques (Lebessi 1976,172, pis. 24,25, no. B6). The standard type at Prinias, however, is an open helmet with a high crest. 76 With the possible exception of bronze objects identified as shield bosses. However, Haggis et al. (2007,260) identified these thin bronze disks as clothing ornaments; see also Prent 2005,368-77. 77 SEG 27 631. Epigraphic dating of the armor in the Aph rati hoard has often conflicted with the dates determined by the style of figural motifs (Bile 1988, 35-40; Prent 2005, 386 n. 951). Morris (1992,160) assumed that the mitra inscribed with the Spensithios decree was an heirloom. The building housing this material has also sparked controversy. Viviers (1994, 244-49) disputed the excavator's interpretation and identified it as an andmon, not a temple, developing earlier suggestions by DeVries (1974) and Kopeke (1974,430). 78 Halbherr 1901,389, pi. 12; Rouse 1902,134. 79 For temple slaves in classical Greece, see Pritchett 1971, 96;Garlan 1988,112-13.</page><page sequence="21">2009] ROUSSA EKKLESIA, PART 1 373 Buschor suggested as its subject Neoptolemos and Astyanax, disputing Halbherr's identification of the youth as a girl and its implications for a mythological reading of the scene.80 But while such an interpreta tion might be convincing in a mainland Greek setting, the near absence of mythological narrative in Cretan pot painting and other media makes it untenable for this ambiguous scene.81 Perhaps the plaque depicts a ritual. The nude youth is almost certainly a boy. His long hair, swept back and tied at the end, has ritual implications and denotes late adolescence, before the transition to manhood.82 In addition, male nudity can be understood as a kind of costume for initiates, as might be expected from later literary and epigraphic accounts of the Ekdusia and similar festivals, in which Cretan boys stripped.83 A pas sage from Strabo describes Cretan initiation ceremo nies in which young men returning to the city after a stay in the countryside received a cloak, a sacrificial ox, and a drinking cup from an erastes. None of these objects appears on this plaque, but Strabo's descrip tion includes another detail with a possible bearing on the scene (10.4.21): They have a peculiar custom in regard to love affairs, for they win the objects of their love, not by persua sion, but by abduction; the lover tells the friends of the boy three or four days beforehand that he is going to make the abduction; but for the friends to conceal the boy, or not to let him go forth by the appointed road, is indeed a most disgraceful thing, a confession, as it were, that the boy is unworthy to obtain such a lover; and when they meet, if the abductor is the boy's equal or superior in rank or other respects, the friends pursue him and lay hold of him, though only in a very gentle way, thus satisfying the custom; and after that they cheerfully turn the boy over to him to lead away; if, however, the abductor is unworthy, they take the boy away from him. And the pursuit does not end until the boy is taken to the andreion of his abductor. Thus, it would appear that a ritual abduction trig gered a rite of passage ceremony, with separation, seclusion, and reintegration phases.84 Homosexual courtship is not itself evidence for initiation, but an other detail of the story?the period of seclusion in the countryside as the youth hunted with his erastes?does point to an initiation structure.85 The official coming of age ceremony may have taken place later, in what the sources describe as a collective marriage. Not all adolescents reached the man's world of the andreion in the same way, through abduction and months of seclusion in the countryside. Those chosen for this role received the title parastathentes and gained posi tions of honor at dances and races, wearing distinctive dress for life as the prerogative of an elite. Moreover, the abduction may have established a personal bond between eromenos and erastes that evolved throughout their lives. In many societies, religion helps make sense of these changes, and Strabo's account specifically con nects the return of the youth with a sacrificial meal. A plaque depicting a ritual abduction would make sense as a dedication at Roussa Ekklesia, a sanctuary in the liminal wilderness. It would also impart an aristocratic flavor to the ceremonies. But Strabo's testimony requires qualification. He gives the impression that ritual abduction was a vener 80 Buschor 1914, 133, fig. 95. Hartwig (1893, 550, pi. 58) identified the subject as Achilles and Troilos. If a girl, the cap tive might be Kassandra, as suggested by Dohan 1931, 226. 81 For the proclivities of orientalizing Cretan artists, see Whitley 1997, 660. Higgins (1967, 28) mentioned a few possi ble exceptions to this absence of mythological narrative. From Gortyn come two seventh-century terracotta plaques thought to depict Theseus and Ariadne and the murder of Agamem non. Mythological depictions are also rare in the Classical and Hellenistic periods. Callaghan (1978,21) referred to a plaque depicting the rape of Amymone from the Shrine of Glaukos at Knossos. 82 The small scale of the youth might suggest a younger boy, not an adolescent around the age of 18. But Cretan artists tol erated vast discrepancies in scale, as shown by the diminutive figure in the field of a Prinias warrior stele (supra n. 59). 83 Male nudity for initiates is not a Cretan concept but a general Greek custom perhaps associated with ritual athlet ics (Bonfante 1989, 545-46, 551; Pinney 1993; Stewart 1997, 27-34; Merker 2000, 61). For the Ekdusia festival at Phaistos, Dreros, and Mallia, see Willetts 1962, 175-80; Leitao 1995, 130-36; Koehl 2000,133-34. For Callaghan (1978,24-6) and Stewart (1997,28), the Knossian story of Glaukos with its erot ic undertones and Zeus' abduction of Ganymede served as divine archetypes for human initiates. 84 Van Gennep (1960) was the first to observe the regu lar tripartite pattern of rituals associated with birth, puberty, marriage, and death; see also Eliade 1958; Ries 1986, 13-26; Bell 1992; Koehl 2000,132; Langdon 2008,83-7. As Jameson (1990, 216) observed, not all rite of passage ceremonies were open to every citizen. Access was often restricted, making some ceremonies the privilege of an elite. E.g., the Daphne phoria festival at Thebes seems to have been a rite of passage restricted to males of the ruling class (Papalexandrou 2008, 257). 85 Davidson (2007, 300-13), in a discussion of this Cretan abduction ritual, distinguished between homosexual court ship and official rite of passage ceremonies sponsored by the state. In his analysis, homosexuality facilitated peer bonding in elite ranks and did not function as a shock to the system in civic initiation ceremonies. Similarly, Dover (1988,116-19, 123), who disputed the idea that homosexual copulation was integral to Greek initiation paradigms, explained the pres ents to the Cretan eromenos without reference to initiation.</page><page sequence="22">374 BRICE ERICKSON [AJA 113 able Cretan custom much older than his source, the fourth-century author Ephoros, but does not provide arguments for its antiquity. If the plaque from Rous sa Ekklesia was a representation of this ritual, it was made some two centuries before the first known liter ary reference, a serious chronological discrepancy.86 And Strabo seems to follow his source uncritically in thinking that every Cretan polis had interchangeable customs and practiced the same abduction ritual. De spite its colorful details, his account is an abstraction of social behavior, a ritual set at an unspecified place and time.87 It seems unlikely that an island as large as Crete and with as many poleis would find common ground socially or politically, although at least one other sanctuary, Kato Syme, has yielded votives allud ing to a trip to a rural sanctuary, sacrifice, and an erotic relationship between an older man and an adolescent coming of age.88 Later Terracotta Figurines Only a handful of terracottas can be dated after the middle of the sixth century (fig. 18[152-60]). All are figurines rendered either in high relief or almost fully in the round. Catalogue number 152 is a plain version of a popular Greek type, the enthroned goddess. Her long hair, divided into two locks on each side, ends at the breasts. A small head of the same scale with crudely rendered hair, eyes, nose, and mouth probably came from a similar figurine with a different hairstyle (cat. no. 153) and resembles a larger head (cat. no. 154); both have an elliptical frame that resembles a veil. These three can be dated to the Late Archaic or Clas sical period. The subject of catalogue numbers 155 and 156, figurines from perhaps the same mold, is a standing female who wears a chiton with a himation draped over the left shoulder and across the abdo men. She holds an offering to her breast. These two resemble a Knossian example, based on a Rhodian type, dated to the middle of the fifth century.89 Four other fragments at Roussa Ekklesia depict heads of a female subject with a low polos. Two are from the same or an identical mold (cat. nos. 157, 158). Their thick, heavy eyelids and thin patches of evenly divided hair suggest a date in the fifth century. The smaller-scale catalogue number 159 has the same Severe Style eyes and elongated head but more plastically rendered hair. It is close in style to catalogue number 160, but this rounder face has a fuller head of hair and lacks the heavy eyelids of the others. Its long neck raises the possibility that the head was inserted into a sepa rate body made either of clay or some other material. Stylistically, this is among the latest figurines at the sanctuary and can be dated to ca. 450. These figurines perpetuate what seems to be an ori entalizing convention of a female deity at the sanctu ary. The enthroned subject can be none other than the goddess. For the others, however, distinguishing deity from priestess or votary is difficult. Figurines at other sanctuaries are often ambiguous, even with the codification of rules for depicting deities and their attributes in the sixth century. For example, on the Athenian Acropolis, the most common figurine of a standing kore and other types without divine attributes can be interpreted as either generic representations of the goddess or human worshipers.90 For terracottas at Corinth, Merker regarded a polos as a possible sign of divine status, but she reserved judgment except in cases of an enthroned figure with a polos.91 At sanctu aries where the principal deities are known, figurine types do not necessarily correspond to those at other sanctuaries of the same gods, and the attested recipi ents of cult are not always the ones most commonly depicted.92 At Roussa Ekklesia, heads wearing a polos (cat. nos. 157-60) are better candidates for divinities than are the standing females (cat. nos. 155,156), but these identifications are all uncertain. 86 Unless Willem (1955, 120-23; 1962, 116-18), Koehl (1986, 109; 1997, 138; 2000, 134), Sergent (1986, 18, 20-6), and Morris (1992, 138) were correct in seeing the presen tation of cup, cloak, and ox as a Minoan?or even an Indo European?ritual. The evidence for a ritual this old is weak. For Bremmer (1980, 283), Buffiere (1980, 52-3), and Patzer (1982, 73), the presentation ritual is a Dorian creation. Do ver's (1988,130-31) arguments for dating the first represen tations of overt homosexuality in Greek literature and art to the seventh century and seeing them as reflections of a new practice would mean that the Cretan abduction could not have existed in the form presented by Strabo before the sev enth century. 87Perlman's (1992, 198-201; 2005, 286) examination of fourth-century and later sources, including Aristotle's discus sion of the Cretan constitution, suggests that ancient authors derived much of their information from a single polis, Lyk tos, and glossed over regional variations and local customs. As Dover (1989,189) observed, there is no trace of the ritual described by Ephoros in the island's rich epigraphic record or other archaeological sources. 88 For the social implications of the bronze plaques, see Lebessi 1985, 188-98; 1991, 163-65; Koehl 2000, 138; Prent 2005,577-84; Langdon 2008,90-4. 89 See Higgins 1973, 59-60, pi. 33, no. 17.

A few terracotta korai possess unmistakable attributes of Athena. 91 Merker 2000, 328. 92Alroth (1987, 9-18; 1989, 65-6) called these interlopers visiting gods. E.g., although the Corinthian sanctuary yielded</page><page sequence="23">2009] ROUSSA EKKLESIA, PART 1 375 157 Fig. 18. Terracotta figurines from Roussa Ekklesia (cat. nos. 152-60) (C. Papanikolopoulos). In addition, the small number and fragmentary condition of the figurines from Roussa Ekklesia makes it difficult, with two exceptions (cat. nos. 155, 156), to detect foreign stylistic influences. Connections between mainland Greece, Crete, and other islands, however, have been documented at the Sanctuary of Demeter at Knossos, where a series of figurines begins ca. 500-450 with imitations of Rhodian, Attic, and Corinthian models before a local style emerges.93 But developments elsewhere on the island may have led in different directions. At Olous, for example, local workshops copied almost every known fifth-century Rhodian type, including close derivatives of large female head protomes, suggesting a special relation ship between this site and Rhodes.94 Roussa Ekklesia, however, does not reveal such a clear pattern. The Rhodian influence of catalogue numbers 155 and 156 may have reached this sanctuary through Cretan or other intermediaries. SYMBOL AND CULT One approach to Greek sanctuaries begins with the identification of the principal deity or deities and then proceeds back from the literate periods and descrip tions of gods and ceremonies to the prehistoric foun dation, using texts as a guide for interpreting physical remains. Yet filling in earlier periods of religious history by analogy to later literature and inscriptions almost always stresses formal continuities and reinforces a questionable picture of Cretans as paradigmatic con servatives, inheritors of strong Minoan traditions and tribal Dorian institutions.95 Furthermore, since Roussa Ekklesia did not enter the written record in antiquity, the material record constitutes the first step. Do the 151 no certain depictions of Demeter or Kore, other deities ap pear in recognizable form, including Aphrodite, the nymphs, Artemis, Nike, Eros, and Dionysos (Merker 2000, 250-55, 340). 93 Higgins 1967, 59; 1973,57; see also Mortzos 1985,93. 94 Higgins 1967, 59. For a discussion of possible Rhodian interest in Crete in the period of Athenian naval hegemony, see infra n. 173. 95Willetts (1955) implicitly endorsed this view of Cretan primitivism by dividing Greek legal history into three stages of increasing sophistication, represented by Sparta, Crete, and Athens. Morris (1990, 253) criticized traditional approaches to Gortynian family organization and the depiction of "primi tive, tribal Dorians setting the clock back millennia in Crete." For Wallace (2003b, 623), changes in Early Iron Age herding and economic practices ruptured Minoan structures and rep resent a new era.</page><page sequence="24">376 BRICE ERICKSON [AJA 113 terracotta plaques represent a single assemblage, or do they belong to different periods? The 94 plaques (cat. nos. 4-97) of a female subject wearing a high polos have been dated on stylistic grounds to the third quarter of the seventh century. Three plaques (cat. nos. 1-3) may be slightly earlier, if the primitive styling is not a func tion of a different manufacturing technique and/or a different production center. On stylistic grounds, the 45 plaques depicting a male votary (cat. nos. 98-142), three depictions of a griffin (cat. nos. 143-45), and one sphinx (cat. no. 146) could be dated slightly later than the Astarte plaques, to ca. 630-600. Nevertheless, this chronological range overlaps with the earliest dates for the others, meaning that no plaque was necessarily made any earlier or later than the rest. Since stylistic dating gives access only to the arche types, not a potentially long series of plaques from a common mold, production may have continued long after ca. 630-600. The poor quality of plaques from later-generation molds, however, suggests that plaque makers did not endlessly cannibalize older types. The only definite sixth-century plaques are in a mature ar chaic style with different subjects (cat. nos. 147-51). These should be dated to ca. 575-525 and may come from as few as two plaques. Since all nine figurines (cat. nos. 152-60) can be dated to the first half of the fifth century, any argument for cult continuity from the seventh to the fifth century will need to confront this incongruous and exceptionally poor phase in the sixth century. Either people stopped visiting the sanctuary or their attention shifted to other spheres of activity with little or no archaeological footprint.96 Our knowledge of most aspects of worship at Roussa Ekklesia depends on representational imagery. This is a poor guide to the sanctuary, since votives un doubtedly had a subsidiary role to animal sacrifice and libations. Votive representations also raise dif ficult questions about the experience of viewing im ages and the identity of the deity and worshipers. As Merker emphasized, ancient worshipers could decode images that we cannot; the arrangement of sacred space, speech and actions, and ephemeral offerings all created a framework for understanding.97 Only at the most basic level do terracottas have uncontested meanings for us. They should be read as physical manifestations of prayers and personal expressions of piety. In addition, they often represent the deity as a gesture of thanks, while another common subject is the dedicant, with the most explicit varieties showing him or her in the act of prayer or bringing an animal for sacrifice.98 Gender presents the greatest problems of interpretation. Dengate's study of seventh-century votives from Peloponnesian sanctuaries found a con nection to the gender and identity of the deity, while other votives may tell more about the worshipers in stead.99 As Merker concluded, combinations of objects are more revealing than isolated images.100 And no depiction, no matter how rare, should be considered irrelevant for understanding cult. The Astarte plaques at Roussa Ekklesia and other Cretan sanctuaries have suggested to some the wor ship of a goddess with an emphasis on fertility.101 Oth ers have drawn on Near Eastern examples of naked goddesses to posit a more complex message for these plaques. Near Eastern and Greek literature refer to dangerous encounters with a sex goddess. In the Epic of Gilgamesh, a sexually aggressive Ishtar frightens Gil gamesh because of her propensity to destroy or maim her lovers.102 And in the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite, An chises worries that he will be punished after copulating with Aphrodite. Feminine charm and fecundity went along with ferocity and prowess in battle, making the naked goddess a patron of warriors.103 A connection with male initiation corrects older, simplistic views of 96 At mainland sanctuaries, a brief gap in the record of vo tives would probably not be so troubling. E.g., Larson (2001, 227-28) acknowledged that sacred caves in Athenian territo ry may have received perishable offerings, including wreaths, flowers, libations of milk, and wooden figurines, before the archaeologically attested beginnings of cult in the fifth cen tury. In her view, mass production of votives made the differ ence between archaeologically invisible and visible cults. But a period of mass-produced votives giving way to perishable of ferings before mass production resumed in the fifth century is harder to accept, especially on Crete, where the sixth cen tury is fraught with problems of archaeological and historical interpretation. 97Merker2000,323. 98 Van Straten 1981, 81. Rouse (1902, 353-93) identified two basic categories of votives: objects of high intrinsic value and those standing for something else, whether an abstract concept or a tangible aspect of cult. For a general discussion of Cretan votives, see Sj?gren 2008,145-48. "Dengate 1988, 147-57, 223-27. For Simon (1986, 410 20), however, the needs and status of the dedicants usually determined votive types in archaic Ionia; see also Hall 1995, 597; Watrous 1996,81-2. For gender patterns at Spartan sanc tuaries, see Hodkinson 2000,289-90. 100 Merker 2000,323. 101 Ammerman (1991, 226-29), e.g., accepted the tradi tional identification of Astarte plaques as representations of an Orientalizing-period fertility goddess or an Aphrodite/ Astarte hybrid. For B?hm (1990, 78-9,134-37), however, the only secure connection is the worship of a female deity. 102Burkert 1979,99-122; Marinatos 2000,10. io3Herrmann (1969,45) emphasized the warlike aspects of Astarte to the point of denying a connection to fertility. For a more balanced account, see Hillers 1970, 613.</page><page sequence="25">2009] ROUSSA EKKLESIA, PART 1 377 Ishtar, Astarte, and Anat as fertility deities. As Walls emphasized for Anat, the idea of a vegetation goddess connected to the natural cycle of death and regenera tion owes more to Sir James Frazer and the myth-ritual school of interpretation than any sympathetic reading of Near Eastern sources. Cuneiform tablets depict Anat in many guises: as a nubile young maiden who engages in the masculine pursuits of hunting and warfare, as a fierce and violent goddess who threatens the estab lished order and, paradoxically, ensures the balance of cosmic powers, and as a compassionate wet nurse to the royal family. Gender is essential for understanding Anat, for she combines masculine and feminine roles and straddles divides of patriarchic culture.104 Cretan depictions of frontal nudes in compositions with more than one figure suggest a goddess with sexual powers and a connection to male initiation, rather than fertility. These scenes include a bronze shield from the Idaean cave depicting a nude with outstretched arms touching the heads of two large felines (fig. 19) and a clay plaque from Aphrati show ing a nude with two young men at her side, who touch her arm and shoulder. Marinatos rightly discounted earlier interpretations of this second scene as a mytho logical abduction in favor of a Near Eastern inspired narrative of contact with divine sexuality.105 Most rep resentations with more than one figure come from bronze dedications or monumental relief sculpture; they might have triggered for ancient viewers a more nuanced appreciation of the seemingly generic ter racottas as abbreviated symbols of a dangerous con frontation with divine sexual power. Even the most overtly sexual images, however, need not be read as "Aphrodites" or some Cretan conflation of Aphro dite and Astarte. Like the generic representations of enthroned deities in the Classical period, the Astarte type seems to have been appropriate for different god Fig. 19. Bronze shield from the Idaean cave depicting frontal female nude flanked by felines (E. Kunze; ? DAI Athens, neg. 1973/1843). desses, with the exotic image cutting across otherwise well-defined religious assemblages.106 Perhaps Cretans used the type to portray minor divinities and nymphs as well. Indeed, Roussa Ekklesia would make sense as a sanctuary of the nymphs, given their association with springs, male initiation, and civic identity.107 The offerings from Roussa Ekklesia overturn the conventional assumption that Cretan spring sanctu aries were havens for female worshipers of a fertility goddess, with little or no participation of men.108 The votary plaques provide stronger evidence for male worshipers. They can no longer be dismissed as odd and discordant plaques paling in significance to the well-known female depictions. The 45 examples from Roussa Ekklesia (cat. nos. 98-142) make up 30% of the seventh-century assemblage, with a ratio of nude goddesses to male votaries of roughly 2:1. This male subject is dressed for a ritual occasion in a fancy cloak with fringed edges and has short hair appropriate for 104 Walls 1992,1-11. 105 Marinatos 2000, 28, 31, fig. 1.39. A fragmentary clay relief from Axos may depict something similar (Prent 2005, 412). For shields from the Idaean cave with nude subjects, see Marinatos 2000,18-20, figs. 1.30,1.31. Another depiction, an architectural relief from the Sanctuary of Athena at Gortyn, shows a striding male between two nudes. According to Mari natos (2000, 77-8, fig. 4.9), the man's pose with arms reach ing around the heads of the females can be understood as a bid for control. 10&lt;iThese plaques appear at sanctuaries whose later histo ries reveal the worship of different deities, including Athena, Artemis, Aphrodite, Hera, and Eileithyia (Budin 2003, 63 n. 91). 107 The earliest attested Cretan sanctuary of the nymphs is at Lera on the Akrotiri peninsula and has dedicatory inscrip tions dating to the fifth century (Guest-Papamanoli and Lam braki 1976, 234-37, fig. 13). For other Cretan sanctuaries of the nymphs, see Sporn 2002, 334-36, table 15. As evidence of their civic role, Cretan nymphs or maenads appear on coins (i.e., from Kydonia) and in citizen oaths of the Hellenistic pe riod (Willetts 1962, 207-8). As Larson (2001, 137) observed, the Athenians connected nymphs with male initiation at Mar athon; see also Larson 2007,61-3. 108 Prent (2005,417) tried to establish a context for Astarte plaques through later votives such as ceramic kernoi, which to her suggested offerings of grain and other first fruits with "distinct female connotations." The location of the sanctuary around a spring was also claimed in support of a predominant role for women, because in archaic Greek literature, women are responsible for fetching water from wells, and girls of mar riageable age frequent fountains and springs. But domestic chores involving water are not equivalents for the worship of a goddess. For the role of women at sanctuaries, see Wickert Micknat 1982,56-61.</page><page sequence="26">378 BRICE ERICKSON [AJA 113 initiation. In addition, the offering of a flower, if that is what he holds, evokes the real world of cult. Anoth er hint of male initiation comes in the sixth century, with plaques depicting a warrior abducting a youth (cat. nos. 147-50). Young men in similar attire to these votaries are depicted at other Cretan sanctuaries. Shaw published a representation on a seventh-century Gortynian pot from the Sanctuary of Athena of a youth holding in either hand a cup and a sacrificial victim (fig. 20).109 He wears a tight-fitting tunic and a fringed cloak; the arrangement of his hair in long locks tied at the end is a clear reference to the age of initiation. This repre sentation recalls Strabo's (10.4.21) account of Cretan ceremonies in which young men returning to the city after a stay in the countryside were provided with a cloak, a drinking cup, and an ox, although the Gortyn ian depiction substitutes a goat for an ox. At the Sanc tuary of Aphrodite and Hermes at Kato Syme, bronze cutout plaques dated to the seventh century allude to initiation rites in which youths hunted or subdued agrimia (Cretan wild goats) .no Some struggle with the weight of the animal on their back or carry butchered portions of the carcass, including heads and hind quar ters. The long hair and elaborate costumes identify the youths as ritual participants.111 Watrous believed that boys were not the only initiates at Kato Syme, but his case for girls celebrating a transition before marriage is based on the assumption that Aphrodite needed fe male worshipers.112 If girls did participate, they made little impression on the makers of votives. POLITICAL AND SACRED LANDSCAPES De Polignac stressed the spatial and political di mensions of Greek sanctuaries. By founding new sanctuaries or establishing authority over existing cult Fig. 20. Youth with a sacrificial victim on a pot fragment from Gortyn (Shaw 1983, fig. 4). places, the early polis had a way to mark its territory or assert claims of ownership in contested frontiers.113 His analysis of sacred landscapes has sparked debate over chronology, local variations, methods for con trolling sanctuaries, and ways to measure control and 109 Shaw 1983, 450, fig. 4. In addition, a terracotta figurine of late seventh-century date at Kato Syme depicts a young man with a drinking cup in hand (Herakleion Archaeological Mu seum, inv. no. 20026). A predecessor in bronze at Kato Syme may signal the importance of ritual drinking in rite of passage ceremonies in the Geometric period (Prent 2005, 578). 110 For the bronze plaques, see supra n. 88. The imagery corresponds to an independently corroborated aspect of wor ship, for near the central altar was a black layer filled with ani mal bones and horns, including the skulls of agrimia (Nobis 1988; Watrous 1996, 68, 85). Hermes might be expected to preside over initiation ceremonies, as he later does as patron of the Hellenistic and Roman palaestra (Willetts 1962, 289; Costa 1982,279-80; Marinatos 2003,131-42). 111 Given the unusually explicit iconography, the costumes represented may reflect real garments worn on sacred occa sions. However, one plaque (Lebessi 1985, pi. 41, no. A44) poses problems. Is the elaborate decoration of the sleeveless tunic a depiction of reality or an artistic convention, and does the star pattern on the shoulder correspond to a real tattoo or some other form of body art? 112 Watrous 1996, 69. Given the male associations of these sanctuaries, we should be reluctant elsewhere to postulate largely or exclusively female worshipers from supposedly feminine offerings. For this reason, it is difficult to accept Cassimatis (1982, 450-62) and Uehlinger's (1998, 58) inter pretation of Astarte plaques at the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Gortyn as offerings in female initiation rites involving girls of marriageable age. These and other symbols can be read in different ways. 113 de Polignac 1995,33-53. Another component of his argu ment is that religious practices before the eighth century did notfocus on particular locations (de Polignac 1995,16). Apos sible shift to areas set aside forworship comes with the construc tion of the first in a series of altars at the Heraion of Samos ca. 800 (Kyrieleis 1993,135-37). Morris (1987,189-92) expand ed on this idea of spatial indeterminacy. A skeptic, Sourvinou Inwood (1993, 2-4) regarded the absence of cult parapher</page><page sequence="27">2009] ROUSSA EKKLESIA, PART 1 379 participation archaeologically.114 Cretan evidence has contributed to this debate. For example, Hellenistic inscriptions describing the borders of Olous mention a sanctuary of Aphrodite, which has been identified along the principal route from Olous to the port town of Lato.115 This is a rare case of a sanctuary marking the boundary of a clearly delineated territory; usually we must infer territorial limits through sanctuary lo cations. Votive assemblages provide another perspec tive on sanctuary participation, although attempts to identify the origin of visitors from dedications must consider potentially complex patterns of consumption and production.116 My argument elsewhere for the Cretan sanctuary at Kato Syme changing hands from Aphrati to Lyktos at the turn of the fifth and fourth centuries equated a switch in plain drinking cups with different places of manufacture to derive the origin of visitors.117 Yet macroscopic analysis of fabric cannot secure the identification of ware groups and sources, and knowledge of regional consumption patterns will be needed to equate pots, once they have a known provenance, with political control. A stronger case can be made for Roussa Ekklesia serving as a territorial sanctuary for Praisos, but this conclusion depends on a chain of evidence with each link capable of different interpretations. Beginning with the literary and epigraphic sources for the chora of Praisos, the earliest testimony, by the fourth-cen tury geographer Pseudo-Skylax, states that it reached in both directions (8ir|K?i auxpoxepcoGev), a phrase oc curring elsewhere in his Cretan itinerary and usually interpreted as contiguous territory extending from the north to south coast.118 For Praisos, this would almost certainly mean control of the Akhl?dia Valley, with an outlet in the Siteia plain to the north and another terminus along the rugged southern coastline east of Hierapetra. Territory along a north-south corridor also receives confirmation in a third-century inscrip tion concerning the obligations of communities on the north and south coast, the Sitaitai and Stalitai. From the terms of this decree, Chaniotis and Perlman in ferred that Stalai was a dependency of Praisos.119 The remains of a harbor settlement on the south coast at Dasonari have been identified with Stalai.120 The Sita itai, however, present a problem. It is not clear if these people lived in a polis, and the temptation to locate this community at modern Siteia has no archaeological basis, since the large orientalizing and archaic votive deposit found near a bus station in Siteia may signify a rural sanctuary connected to a settlement elsewhere, nalia in Homeric references to sacrifice as an impediment to his interpretation. 114 Studies of ethne communities and Greek colonies point to different systems for defining and controlling territory. In the colonies of southern Italy, frontiers often enabled in teraction with native populations and played less of a role in managing interpolis rivalries (Carter 1994,175-78; Malkin 1996, 15-17; Osborne 1996, 237-39). Sanctuaries serving ethne communities also differed from polis configurations (Morgan 1990, 8-9; 2003, 108-9). The binary oppositions of de Polignac's model and its lack of concern for chronol ogy have also drawn criticism. E.g., Strom (1988) and Hall (1995) regarded the Argive Heraion, de Polignac's quintes sential extraurban sanctuary, as neutral ground that did not become exclusively Argive until the sixth century or later, after the crucial phase of polis formation. Another complica tion is the success ofWatrous' (1996, 78-81) approach to Psy chro and other prehistoric sanctuaries as territorial markers. If defining territory through religion was a concern of other polities, not just the historical polis, what made the process of territorial consolidation distinctive in each case? For peak sanctuaries in the political and religious landscape of Neopa latial Crete, see Peatfield 1987; 1994, 20-8. Even in modern Greece, religion and politics may have intersected in ways fa miliar to antiquity, with better documentation enabling more sophisticated theories (Greenfield 1997, 78; Nixon 2006, 7; Forbes 2007,352-74). 115ICr 1 16 5 line 70; 1 16 18 lines 7-8; SEG26 1049 lines 63-4; Perlman 2004,1173. For the sanctuary at Sta Lenika, see Mazarakis Ainian 1997,215-16. 116 Arguments for political control have often depended on the production locales of fine pottery. E.g., Tomlinson (1992, 323-26) interpreted Perachora as a Corinthian sanc tuary based on the quantities of fine Corinthian pottery at the site. At archaic Delos, Kourou (2001,27) equated Naxian supply of pottery to the sanctuary with political and economic control?a claim treated skeptically by Constantakopoulou (2007, 44-7), who considered Naxos the "chief influence" at the sanctuary but not its controller. Olympia provides another example. Contrary to the tradition of early Elean influence at Olympia, Morgan (1990, 52-3) refused to see the earliest pottery at Olympia (ca. 725-675), all identified as Elean, as an expression of Elean activity. 117Erickson 2002, 82-5. Before publication of the archaic and classical pottery from Kato Syme, Viviers (1994, 256) had placed this sanctuary within the territory of Biannos. For Kato Syme as a "pan-Cretan" sanctuary instead, see Chaniotis 1988, 33-4. Perhaps excavation and publication of other sanctu aries in the territories of Biannos, Arkades, and Lyktos will clarify the role of pottery styles as possible expressions of po litical control. 118Pseudo-Skylax Periplous 47. Lappa and Lyktos are the other Cretan poleis described in these terms. Viviers (1994, 253) examined the phrase in the context of Lyktian territorial expansion and discussed the dating of Pseudo-Skylax (258 n. 138). For Praisos, see Bosanquet 1939-1940, 69; Spyridakis 1970,27; Perlman 2004,1183. 119/Cr3 6 7; Chaniotis 1996,161-68; Perlman 1996, 257 58; 2004,1187. Bosanquet (1939-1940, 69-72) stressed the economic significance of Leuke, an offshore island (modern Kouphonisi) and base for harvesting murex shells, in territo rial disputes between Praisos and Itanos. 120 Schachermeyer 1938,479; Chaniotis 1996,386. The sur face remains are said to be archaic and classical.</page><page sequence="28">380 BRICE ERICKSON [AJA 113 perhaps coastal Petras or a more defensible site.121 A defensible inland settlement at Koutsoulopetres, iden tified by Perlman as ancient Dragmos, overlooks the Siteia plain, raising the possibility of coastal territory and a connection to the Siteia sanctuary.122 Roussa Ekklesia might also be interpreted as a sub urban or rural cult site of Koutsoulopetres. But, its proximity to this settlement notwithstanding, the votive assemblage bears a striking resemblance to the Vavelli deposit located about 1 km south of the Third Acropo lis of Praisos and suggests a different orientation. Both Roussa Ekklesia and Vavelli are spring sanctuaries with four types of plaques (nude with polos, male votary, griffin, and warrior abducting a youth) made from the same molds or identical ones from the same archetype, with similar fabrics.123 In addition, these plaques appear at both sites in roughly the same ratios, if not also the same numbers. As at Roussa Ekklesia, goddess and male votary plaques are the most common types at Vavelli, with more than 50 votary plaques, in comparison to the 45 at Roussa Ekklesia.124 Also, variants of the nude goddess at Roussa Ekklesia, including a version with triangles at the bottom of the polos (cat. nos. 86-9) and a nude without a polos (cat. no. 96), appear elsewhere only at Vavelli and are from identical molds. The votive assemblage at Siteia could not be more different from Roussa Ekklesia and Vavelli, although it overlaps with them in date. The Siteia deposit includes plaques of nude females of different types, clothed fe males, a charioteer and female, a kourotrophos, cylin drical figurines, and male heads with or without tenons for insertion. Of the nearly 900 terracottas at Siteia, only one type (male votary) has a parallel at Roussa Ekklesia and Vavelli, appearing only twice in the Siteia deposit (0.2% of the assemblage). All other plaques and figurines are made from different molds using a distinct red clay with a gritty consistency. For these reasons, the sanctuaries at Siteia and Roussa Ekklesia may have belonged to two different communities. In other areas as well, terracotta types arguably signaled political boundaries rather than a regional style. For example, Carter observed that figurines at sanctuaries in the more clearly defined territory of Metaponto are similar and often from the same molds.125 In addition, unpublished terracottas made from the same fabric and molds as those from the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Axos have been found at a small open-air sanctuary at Pharatsi next to the Geropotamos River, a possible territorial divide.126 Praisian control over Anoixe might also make sense topographically (fig. 21). Although the easiest way to reach the sanctuary today?from the road east of Sit eia through the village of Roussa Ekklesia?gives the impression of a coastal orientation, worshipers may have approached the site in antiquity by traversing the Ziros plateau from the south. Praisos is situated near a route from the Akhl?dia Valley to this plateau, imply ing control of upland territory at an early date.127 Oth er Cretan poleis (e.g., Lyktos) had positions ensuring control over lower and upland zones, enabling them 121 Papadakis (1983, 89-91) identified a site on the hills of Petras 1 km east of the modern town as ancient Siteia. 122Perlman 2004, 1157. Dragmos was caught in power struggles between Praisos and Itanos that ended with the ab sorption of Dragmos and its territory by Praisos sometime af ter ca. 270-260. Surface investigation at Koutsoulopetres has revealed pottery from the Geometric through Hellenistic pe riods, with walls, cisterns, and tombs (Faure 1963,18; Sj?gren 2003,171, fig. 15 [site E94]). Chaniotis (1996,184), however, identified Epano Zakro as Dragmos based on topographical clues. E.g., the border between Dragmos and Itanos, as known from a Hellenistic inscription (ICrS 4 9 lines 59-61), follows the course of the Sedamnos River, identified by some as the Kokhlakies, which empties into the sea about 5 km south of Palaikastro (Bosanquet 1939-1940, 61-2). If this identifica tion is correct, it implies territory to the south of Itanos, not west in the direction of Praisos. 123Whitley (2006, 609) observed that Vavelli, Mesamvry sis, and Roussa Ekklesia are spring sanctuaries with simple provisions, suggesting a Praisian preference for open-air sanctuaries and watery locations, in contrast to other Cretan communities. Spring sanctuaries, however, seem to be com mon on Crete and mainland Greece. See Jost (1994, 217) for spring sanctuaries in the Arkadian countryside. Fabric studies point to a link between Praisos, Vavelli, and Roussa Ekklesia. According to Higgins (1954,157), the plaques from Praisos have a clay "lightly fired, usually pale orange, with frequently a brown or cream surface," while Forster (1904-1905, 243) de scribed it as the "light-red clay of the district." These descrip tions correspond with the characteristic fabric of the Roussa Ekklesia examples. Yet, without scientific investigations of clay sources and fabric groups, we cannot tell if Praisos or some other site produced all plaques of a common type, or if differ ent sites produced plaques of the same type using traveling molds, or if itinerant craftsmen traveled with molds and made plaques at different locations. For the circulation of molds, see Boardman 1961,113. 124For Vavelli, see Forster 1901-1902, 280; Dohan 1931, 215. Without full publication of the Vavelli deposit, however, exact proportions for the various types cannot be calculated. 125 Carter 1994,181. In addition, a few figurines from sanc tuaries at Paestum were made from the same mold series as examples at Metaponto, suggesting a link between these two poleis with respect to craft traditions, a link also evident in architectural styles and numismatic evidence (Ammerman 1991, 221). Political control, however, was not part of this connection. 126 For the terracottas from Axos, see Rizza 1967-1968. For the sanctuary at Pharatsi, see Andreadaki-Vlasaki 2004, 42. These collections include near-life-sized heads and body frag ments. Another shrine in the vicinity of Axos at Drosia has produced similar archaic and classical terracottas. 127 Roads linking a polis to a sanctuary might imply some form of control.

Map of the Siteia district, east Crete, showing findspots for four plaque types (adapted from Whitley 1998, fig. 2.1). to reap the benefits of two different ecosystems.128 Landscapes are as much mental constructs as products of intrinsic environmental factors. Although we tend to view mountains as barriers to communication, an cient populations may have perceived a link between city, plains, and mountain pastures. In Mediterranean history, places where mountains and coastlands meet have functioned as connection nodes for mixed agri cultural and pastoral economies.129 De Polignac's bipo lar landscape with one major extraurban sanctuary in the countryside adopts the narrow perspective of city dwellers and cultivators of the plain, for whom moun tains were the symbolic antithesis of polis life with no economic function. Mountains did possess a liminal quality in Greek thought as settings where human and divine could mix and social reversals take place, mak ing them suitable for rite of passage ceremonies.130 On Crete, however, territorial divides did not always fall of Roussa Ekklesia passes the west side of a peak of the Ziros range. Another approach is to the east of a second peak on a footpath leading directiy to Anoixe (east of Roussa Ekklesia). Unfortunately, ancient road networks are not attested for this region, with the exception of an ancient path traced by Spratt (1865,1:186) on his descent from Etia on the Ziros plateau to the Akhl?dia Valley, a southern passage now followed by the modern road. This path appears in no other source. Halbherr (1901, 374) mentioned an ancient road connecting the First Acropolis and Second Acropolis at Praisos. The Praisos sur vey of the 1990s, however, did not reveal any trace of ancient roads. For the Venetian and Turkish kalderimia system, see Whitleyetal. 1999, 220. 128 Pendlebury (1939, 10) traced the main routes of com munication down from Lasithi, with the principal western line passing Lyktos. Spratt (1865,1:186) was the first to compare the Ziros plateau to Lasithi and suggest Lyktian and Praisian control over upland territory. He also observed that olives did not grow on Ziros and Lasithi, despite the 1,000-ft. dif ference in elevation, and documented different land charac teristics and uses of uplands and plains (Spratt 1865, 1:176). Haggis (1993, 134-43, 157-60) drew an analogy to settle ment patterns of early 20th-century Crete, in which seasonal coastal and upland sites benefited groups engaged in agricul tural and pastoral activities; see also Watrous 1982,10-11, 34; Forbes 1995,327-28; Nowicki 2000, 223-47. 129 For mountain connectivity, see Horden and Purcell 2000,82. 130 For mountains as liminal zones in Greek myth and ritual, see Buxton 1994, 84-92; Cole 2004, 178-88, 191-94. Polin skaya (2003, 86, 94-6), however, questioned de Polignac's interpretation of liminal sanctuary locations as a metaphor for liminal periods of life, concluding that Athenian terri tory does not present such a clear case of liminality for the ephebeia.</page><page sequence="30">382 BRICE ERICKSON [AJA 113 along mountains and what de Polignac regarded as economically marginal land.131 Moreover, the Praisian countryside reveals a different pattern of sanctuaries, with many small rural cult sites rather than a single major expression of liminality for the territory.132 Sanctuaries along the divide between upland and coastal zones at Roussa Ekklesia and Stou Koukou to Kephali might make sense as territorial markers of Praisos (fig. 22).133 The Ziros plateau attracted wor shipers and settlers in the Archaic period, as indicated by sanctuaries and small habitation sites encountered on survey.134 From Moulas, a sanctuary on the south ern edge of the plateau, come three plaques identical to the nude with a high polos from Roussa Ekklesia (cat. nos. 4-85), Vavelli, and Lapsanari.135 Perhaps sanctuaries at Hagios Georgios and Lapsanari with two or three plaque types corresponding to Vavelli and Roussa Ekklesia can be understood as outposts defin ing the western edge of Akhl?dia and the mouth of a smaller western tributary (Skalabidiakos River) where it empties into the Siteia plain. We may never know the choices influencing the location of each sanctuary. For modern Sphakia (west Crete), religious buildings can mark important natural resources and routes of communication, occupy points visible by land and sea, delineate regional boundaries, and memorialize past activity. What Nixon described as a grammar of location for Sphakia is not a passive response to topo graphic features but a cultural construct discernable through study of the complete landscape.136 Sanctuar ies in our case have different combinations of plaques, suggesting different religious practices. Differences are apparent even in the heart of Prai sian territory. Gaps in publication mean that the only documented type at the urban center are male vo tary plaques from a sanctuary deposit located below the First Acropolis, but from this deposit came other plaques reportedly of the same types as at Vavelli.137 Terracottas from the sanctuary on the Third Acropolis, however, were identified by Forster as different from those found at Vavelli or Mesamvrysis, another spring sanctuary south of the city.138 In addition, a sanctuary on top of Profitis Elias, with a commanding view of the northern half of the valley and the Siteia plain, has a completely different focus, judging from the survey collection. At this sanctuary, a fragmentary male votary plaque and animal figurine pale in comparison with the homogenous collection of 150 plain black drink ing cups and wine jugs.139 Although this emphasis on drinking may be the result of the surface scatter coming from a kiln connected to the sanctuary, this installation is itself an indication of priorities at the site.140 131 Wallace (2003b, 623) pointed to Cretan exceptions to counter the suggestion that elite herding activities marked the boundaries of classical Greek poleis. 132 Praisos is not the only polis with such a dense pattern of rural sanctuaries and no singly marked edge. At Metaponto, extramural sanctuaries were established in the sixth century along routes of communication on the banks of the Basento and Bradano Rivers as far as 13 km into the interior. Only later in the sixth century with the construction of the monumental Temple of Hera (Tavole Palatine) on the Bradano does Meta ponto resemble de Polignac's bipolar landscape. Perhaps this new configuration was a response to pressure from Taranto, its eastern neighbor. Carter (1994,175-78), however, saw the Temple of Hera as marking the frontier between Greek colo nial interests and Iapygia to the east. 133 Stou Koukou to Kephali, however, has only one type in common with Roussa Ekklesia and Vavelli, male votary plaques from British excavations of 1901 (Prent 2005, 310). 134Mariani (1895, 176, fig. 6) and Faure (1967, 129) re ported a cult site with what seem to be sixth-century bronze figurines at Patelia near Sitanos on the northern side of the plateau (Sj?gren 2003, 171, fig. 15 [site E88]). For the sanc tuary on the summit of the Khandriano Plai hill near Khan dra on the western edge of the plateau, see Faure 1967,129; Sj?gren 2003, 171, fig. 15 (site E89). Unfortunately, fewvo tives from these sanctuaries were published, so we cannot compare them to the Roussa Ekklesia assemblage. For the habitation site in the mountains near Khandra, see Sj?gren 2003,172, fig. 15 (site E97). Another settlement site lies at the foot of Mt. Plagia on the eastern edge of the plateau (Sj?gren 2003,172,fig. 15 [siteE98]). 135 Schlager 1991, 22-3, pi. 24, nos. 2, 4, 5. These plaques are the same size as the Roussa Ekklesia examples and may be from the same mold series. This site also has traces of retain ing walls, 10 other terracotta plaques, and three figurines. Ac cording to Schlager (pers. comm. 2008), the latest pieces may include a Late Archaic or Classical head. 136 Nixon 2006, 23-31. For the application of these criteria to ancient Greece, see Nixon 2006,109-16. According to Wal lace (2003a, 260-65), emerging Cretan poleis incorporated the past by transforming abandoned LMIIIC settlements into cult centers in visibly dominant positions. The only religious location expressing a connection to the past in our case is the votive deposit at Stou Koukou to Kephali, which lies above the ruins of a Bronze Age farmstead (Whitley 2008). 137Bosanquet 1901,340; Forster 1901-1902,271,280; Prent 2005, 304. 138Forster 1901-1902,272-78, figs. 2, 3. 139 Whitley et al. (1999, 249-51) also mentioned part of a bronze pin discovered on the steep north slope of the hill just below the modern church. Bosanquet (1939-1940, 64) was not sufficiently impressed by the remains on Profitis Elias to identify them as the Temple of Diktaean Zeus said by Strabo (10.4.12) to have been in Praisian territory. Prent (2005, 349 50) sided with Faure (1960,194-95) in classifying Profitis Elias as an extraurban sanctuary with regional significance. But this site is only 2.5 km from the Third Acropolis of Praisos, making it difficult to see it as anything but a Praisian possession. 140 For the pottery and kiln wasters, see Erickson 2000, 318-27.</page><page sequence="31">2009] ROUSSA EKKLESIA, PART 1 383 Given these differences between sanctuaries at or near Praisos, the almost identical profiles of the Vavelli and Roussa Ekklesia assemblages (ca. 630-500) sug gest a special relationship. Jost examined what might be a similar phenomenon of sanctuary doublets in the towns and countryside of Arkadia. For example, as a result of the synoicism for the foundation of Mega lopolis, the new urban center maintained prominent sanctuaries in deserted towns and established new cult centers in the city for Lykaion Zeus and Hermes Aka kesios, modeling them after preexisting sanctuaries with identical cult statues and similar architectural fur nishings.141 Other Arkadian poleis established satellite cults in the countryside. For Praisos, worshipers might have passed Vavelli on their way to Roussa Ekklesia, with processions assembling at this suburban sanctu ary before the 12 km journey to the edge of Praisian territory.142 Perhaps this outlier can be understood as a doublet of Vavelli, with worship of the same deity or deities. Does an expansion of Praisian power through the Akhl?dia Valley and the Ziros plateau as early as ca. 630-600 make sense of the settlement history at Prai sos? Territory implies a functioning polis, raising the 141Jost (1994,224-28) cited examples of sanctuary doublets at Kaphyai, Pheneos, and Megalopolis. She described the aba ton of the urban sanctuary of Lykaion Zeus at Megalopolis as a replica of the building in the original sanctuary on Mt. Lykaion (Jost 1994, 227). Her observations are based on Pau sanias, who also refers to apparent doublets and identical cult statues outside Arkadia, including the territories of Megara (Paus. 1.44.7) and Argos (Paus. 2.25.9). In addition, Tomlin son (1992, 324) saw the Sanctuary of Hera Akraia at Corinth as a counterpart to the sanctuary at Perachora. Connections between sanctuaries may have involved not only similar cult statues but also figurine types, as Alroth (1989, 34) suggested for Tiryns. Its terracottas of a seated goddess were perhaps modeled after the cult statue at the Heraion. In addition, Hall (1995, 603) regarded the Agamemnoneion as a sanctu ary of Hera and a doublet to the roadside terrace shrine near the Heraion. The Cycladic islands provide other possible ex amples of sanctuary doublets. According to Constantakopou lou (2007, 43-7, 54-5), the sanctuaries of Delian Apollo on Naxos, Paros, and Despotiko may have linked these islands to the great Delian cult center. For doublets and even triplets in Athenian territory, see Rosenzweig 2004,41; Parker 2005, 52. 142 Graf (1996, 55-61) classified processions into two types (centripetal and centrifugal) with different participants and religious purposes. Drawing on Pausanias (8.39.5) Jost (1994, 222) characterized an urban sanctuary of Artemis Soteira at Phigaleia as an assembly point for processions to sanctuaries in the countryside. Vavelli may have had a similar function. The trip to Roussa Ekklesia perhaps necessitated overnight stays; classical and Hellenistic lamps at the sanctuary may be remnants from nocturnal visits.</page><page sequence="32">384 BRICE ERICKSON [AJA 113 question of when state institutions emerged at Prai sos.143 In this case, changes in settlement patterns ca. 900-700 signify a political transition. A large Late Mi noan (LM) IIIC refuge settlement at Kalamafki, about 2 km from the later site of Praisos, may have been the first population center before it was abandoned after ca. 900.144 The next sizable settlement was at Praisos, with the earliest evidence coming from nearby tombs, a votive deposit from a sanctuary (altar and temenos) on the Third Acropolis, and terracottas from Vavelli. Nothing from the tombs or acropolis sanctuary neces sarily dates earlier than the first quarter of the seventh century, while the earliest plaques from Vavelli have been dated stylistically to ca. 650.145 If settlement be gan at Praisos in the early seventh century, it did not take long before inhabitants started visiting cult sites at Vavelli and Mesamvrysis.146 But there is a lag of at least another 20 years before activity at other sanctu aries in the countryside, ca. 630-600 (Hagios Geor gios, Lapsanari, Roussa Ekklesia, and Stou Koukou to Kephali), for they do not have the earliest votive types such as the warrior plaques from Vavelli or the cylindrical figurines from the Third Acropolis. Either it took time to establish control over remote areas, or Praisos had control but only began defining the ter ri to rial margins through cult at a later stage, making the possession visible archaeologically.147 While the spatial pattern of sanctuaries suspected of being in the chora of archaic Praisos does not in dicate territory on the north coast, by the middle of the fourth century, Praisos had gained a northern and southern outlet to the sea and later absorbed Dragmos and its territory, which may have included coastal pos sessions. The rich epigraphic record presents a vivid picture of conquests and territorial acquisitions in the Hellenistic period, but this process may have begun earlier, with Praisos obtaining territory on the north coast in the sixth or fifth century. Praisos itself later fell victim to Hierapytna, which conquered the polis and absorbed its territory in the 140s B.C.E., establish ing a new frontier with Itanos, which is the subject of a treaty.148 Ancient authorities give the impression of a complete abandonment of Praisos and its territory during the Roman period. Although archaeologists have learned to treat such claims with skepticism, ex cavations at Praisos produced nothing datable after ca. 150, and survey of the city and countryside has re vealed no evidence for Hellenistic occupation and only scant traces of Roman activity.149 Activity also ceased at Roussa Ekklesia with the last in a series of lamps dated 143Snodgrass (1980, 21-38) advocated an eighth-century origin for the polis on archaeological grounds. The attested dates for Greek colonies in Sicily (e.g., Megara Hyblaea in 728 B.C.E.) may point to a similar date for polis institutions, unless they give a false impression of instantaneous development by masking precolonial contacts and earlier settlement histories (Osborne 1998, 252-68). According to Watrous and Hadzi Vallianou (2004, 339-41), state formation is usually a slow structural change rather than an all-or-nothing transition. For Wallace (2003a, 257), the Protogeometric is a turning point on Crete, the beginning of a long process of settlement nucleation and political development leading to the archaic poleis. Yet an island as large and politically diverse as Crete must have experienced countless variations in polis develop ment. At Gortyn, Perlman (2000, 63, 71-2) interpreted the transformation of a hilltop settlement on Hagios Ioannis into a community sanctuary ca. 700 as a sign of Gortynian political development. For the spatial organization of other Cretan po leis, see Prent 2005,220-26. 144Whitley (1998,33) reported an absence of late Protogeo metric and Geometric pottery from the site; see also Nowicki (2000,56-8), who mentioned orientalizing and perhaps even archaic sherds. If Nowicki's dating is correct, occupation at Kalamafki may have overlapped with the foundation at Prai sos. Another Early Iron Age hilltop site, Sfakia Kastri, is per haps contemporary with Kalamafki (Nowicki 2000, 55-6). 145 For the earliest funerary evidence, see Bosanquet 1901 1902, 242-43, fig. 21 (Tomb A). For the terracottas from the Third Acropolis, see Forster 1901-1902,272-78, figs. 2-4, pis. 13, 14. The miniature bronze helmets, breastplates, mitrai, and shields, as well as real armor from this sanctuary pub lished by Bosanquet (1901-1902, 258-59, pi. 10), are more difficult to date. Benton (1938-1939) dated them to the seventh century, while others have proposed a date for the simple bronze disks as early as the ninth century. A few objects of disputable date, however, should not be allowed to bring the foundation back to the ninth or even eighth century. In addition, Whitley et al. (1999, 247-49, fig. 14) dated pottery sherds, including body fragments from stamped pithoi, from survey of the settlement area to the Protogeometric-Orien talizing periods. The illustrated pieces seem to be from the seventh or sixth century. 146According to Forster (1904-1905, 247-48, figs. 4, 5), plaques of a female subject with a tympanum at the waist and warriors in various poses were the earliest at Vavelli. Dohan (1931, 212) and Higgins (1954,157) dated the warriors to the eighth century based on the crude styling. Boardman (1961, 109), however, preferred a date in the seventh century, per haps as late as ca. 650. For cylindrical figurines at Mesamvrysis, see Forster 1901-1902, 278-80, figs. 5-7. 147 This pattern of an urban center before rural sanctuar ies is found at Metaponto, with sanctuaries in the chora com ing 50 years after the urban foundation ca. 600 (Carter 1994, 162-68). Citizens at Metaponto must have been farming this land before the earliest rural sanctuaries, so the territory as an economic unit preceded archaeologically visible boundaries. 148/Cr3 49. 149E.g., Strabo 10.4.12. For the epigraphic evidence, see Guarduccil942,136;Whitleyetal.l995,405.Bosanquet(1939 1940,65) stated that the sanctuary on the Third Acropolis was "deliberately razed to the ground" in the 140s. According to Whitley et al. (1999, 256), no Roman fine ware was found in the territory of Praisos.

If it was not a possession of Praisos from the beginning, this sanctuary had probably become so by the Hellenistic period before losing significance with the new borders between Hierapytna and Itanos. STYLE AND SOCIETY Roussa Ekklesia resembles other Cretan sanctuaries in the seventh century in which terracotta plaques and figurines either vastly outnumber metal, ivory, or other precious votives, or clay is the only material for offer ings. Prent further distinguished between rich sanctu aries that served as meeting places for elite worshipers and a second category of civic cults with local signifi cance, where the concepts of social integration and community participation played a greater ceremonial role. These humble sanctuaries usually have few, if any, architectural provisions; all examples listed by Prent are open-air sanctuaries located near springs.150 She observed that many plaques and figurines at these sites were stamped from the same mold over a long period, resulting in a homogenous collection of offerings that would have reinforced egalitarian concepts of citizen ship. Terracottas must have been much cheaper than bronze arid ivory and therefore accessible to almost every segment of the population. The hundreds, if not thousands, of terracottas of the same types at these sanctuaries suggest a broad level of participation.151 If elites took part in these ceremonies, they may have toned down display, perhaps in an effort to conform to community standards. The Roussa Ekklesia plaques only slightly complicate this picture. If, as I have sug gested, they refer to elite initiates (parastathentes), and the elaborate dress and perfume containers have aris tocratic connotations, these symbols cannot be seen as an outright rejection of elite values. For Morris, orientalizing is a class phenomenon, with exotic materials and imagery evoking the ded icator's privileged links to the Near East as part of an oppositional value system that transcended the ideology of the polis.152 Whitley contended that elites rationed style by restricting access to orientalizing iconography, preventing the dissemination of token symbols beyond aristocratic circles.153 Elite rationing would be expected to leave a pattern of imports and close copies of Near Eastern objects, whereas much of Cretan art is in a hybrid style, taking influences from different sources to create something new, as with the Astarte plaques, for which there are no demonstrable imports or impressions from imported archetypes.154 In this case, different production centers created new types through specific poses, hairstyles, headgear, and (in some cases) clothing. An oriental focus overlooks more tangible influences from other island craft tra ditions (coroplast and pot painting) and loans from mainland Greece.155 On a few occasions, however, elites may have dedi cated objects requiring greater sensitivity to Near East ern myths, stylistic conventions, and cult practices, as with bronze shields and a tympanum (drum or shield) from the Idaean cave. The tympanum depicts a strid ing, bearded male who holds a lion over his head and stands on a bull (fig. 23).156 If a local product, it demonstrates an unusually close relationship to north Assyrian models, perhaps because it was made by an small-scale Roman reoccupation of the territory. Another site found on survey (site 13) may have been occupied between the Late Hellenistic and Roman periods. Branigan (1998,88) suggested that some of the surviving population of Praisos dis persed to the Katelionas and Lamnoni basins on Ziros, which seem to have been resettled in the third or second century. 150Prent's (2005,417) list includes Lapsanari, Mesamvrysis, and Pachlitzani Agriada. Civic sanctuaries cannot always be distinguished from regional cult centers with elite clientele. E.g., Shaw (2000, 693) saw the sanctuary at Kommos as local, whereas Prent (2005, 475) inferred from what she regarded as costly metal votives that it was a regional meeting place. For lavish dedications at the Psychro cave, see Watrous 1996,103. 151 For the social implications of cheap terracotta offerings, see also Salapata 2002, 24, 30; Pilz (forthcoming [a]). Yet not all sanctuaries with elite connotations produced small assem blages of rich votives. Ida is a spectacular exception; recent ex cavations by Sakellarakis (1992,113) have raised the number of ivories previously known from the cave from 34 to 1,034. 1521. Morris (1997, 37) presented a variation of this thesis by distinguishing between middling and elitist ideologies in archaic Greece. The middling ideology emphasizes restraint and membership in a community of equals, whereas the elit ist ideology represents an alternative belief system with an emphasis on Near Eastern luxury. For a critical assessment of class struggle as a social model for archaic Greece, see Ham mer 2004, 480-84. 153Whitley (1994) interpreted proto-Attic pot painting as an elite style largely restricted to funerary and sanctuary con texts. For objections to rationing, see S. Morris 1997, 64. 154 For the absence of imported archetypes on Crete, see Prent 2005, 406. Other parts of the Greek world have pro duced few imported terracottas, although an Astarte plaque of possible Syrian origin has come to light at Corinth (Sala pata 2002, 22). 155Prent (2005, 366, 422) distinguished the seventh century pattern of pervasive Levantine motifs in different me dia from earlier uses of orientalizing art, when Near Eastern styles appeared less frequently and only in the form of por table luxury items. In addition, Whitley's (2004,438) study of decorated pottery in seventh-century Knossian tombs was un able to distinguish oppositional groups using different styles. What Whitley defined as linear is just as orientalizing as the ornate style, leading him to downplay receptivity to Near East ern art as a point of distinction; see also Kotsonas 2006,160. 156Burkert 1992,16-17, fig. 1.</page><page sequence="34">386 BRICE ERICKSON [AJA 113 Fig. 23. Bronze tympanum from the Idaean cave (Prent 2005, pi. 57). immigrant craftsman.157 These iconographic eccentrici ties also may have a bearing on ritual, if they allude to war dances and orgiastic music similar to Near East ern ceremonies.158 Perhaps at the Idaean cave, Near Eastern exotica played a role in an elite world of gift exchange and commemoration.159 While the sanctuary on the Third Acropolis at Praisos has nothing so elabo rate, the plain armor and even the miniature bronzes may have been elite dedications (fig. 24). Moreover, archaic tombs found west of the road from Praisos to Vavelli contained gold and silver jewelry as lavish as anything from this sanctuary.160 Thus, in their tombs and at least one major sanctuary, Praisians disposed of wealth in a conspicuous manner. Yet neither the bronze votives nor the jewelry make explicit allusions to Near Eastern iconography or rituals. The bronzes from the Third Acropolis do not resemble foreign types but rather other Cretan votives at Axos, Gortyn, Dreros, and Palaikastro. If elites from Praisos visited the regional sanctuary at Palaikastro, they probably stressed on these occasions their similarity to other Cretan aristocrats.161 Another level of identity, however, emphasized dif ferences between Praisos and other states. In rituals of incorporation, different segments of the population found common ground in opposition to external ri vals. Here we might expect local styles to play a promi nent role, with homogenous collections of artifacts at community sanctuaries, as we find at Vavelli and Roussa Ekklesia with their masses of cheap terracotta offerings. These sanctuaries express a new political dynamic with the rise of Praisos as a socially integrat ed state. For Praisos, local identity also embraced the tradition of different ethnicity through descent from autochthonous Eteocretans. Public inscriptions using Greek characters to represent the undeciphered Eteo cretan language provide confirmation of this strategy, although perhaps only a small segment of the popula tion, the literate alone, understood them.162 Did ex 157Hoffman (1997, 125-32, 160-65), who studied the bronze relief bowls and shields at Ida, considered manufac turing techniques a better indicator than style of Near East ern origin. Prent (2005, 599-603) rehearsed the evidence for Near Eastern connections at Ida. 158Burkert 1992,48,262,280; Robertson 1996,248. The de monic figures on some shields have Near Eastern precedents and may be connected with music (Blome 1982, 69-70). In addition, a few Cretan terracottas allude to Near Eastern musical rites. Meyers (1987, 119-22) touched on regional differences in musical traditions to explain figurines hold ing percussion instruments from Palestine and Phoenicia. A mold for a similar figurine from Taanach, a site in Palestine, depicts a nude female with a tambourine (Hillers 1970, 609 16). Similar plaques from Praisos, discussed by Dohan (1931, 221-22, fig. 27), differ from Near Eastern prototypes in dress and pose. 159 The explicit Near Eastern iconography of the finest dec orated shields seems to advertise value through geographic distance, although this may be a Active claim of local crafts men who emulated foreign styles. According to Helms (1988, 114-23), objects from distant lands conveyed extraordinary power on their owners, even if the ethnographically attested reasons for the journey included profit; see also Snodgrass 1980,132-33; Jones 2000, 59-66; Aubet 2001,130-34; Lang don 2001,582; Whi?ey 2001,111; 2002, 221. 160 The most lavish grave (Tomb 28) contained silver relief plaques, a silver ring, a gold and crystal necklace and pendant, two gem amulets, three gold beads, a gold sphinx plaque, and 98 tubes of cut and folded gold leaf (clothing ornaments). Marshall (1905-1906, 70) believed that the finest pieces with granulation and orientalizing motifs were imports from Asia Minor, perhaps Lydia. From other tombs came silver and bronze pins, silver earrings and roundels, crystal beads and pendants, and an ivory pendant (Marshall 1905-1906). 161 For the bronzes at Palaikastro, see Bosanquet 1904 1905, 306, pi. 16; Benton 1939-1940, 53-4, pi. 25. Shields with explicit Near Eastern iconography are rare outside the Idaean cave. Eleutherna, Phaistos, and Palaikastro have each produced a single example with a depiction of a female nude holding lotuses, sphinxes, or lions (Prent 2005, 372-73). Per haps scholars have exaggerated Near Eastern influences in Cretan bronzeworking. For Maas (1981,18), the absence of orientalizing motifs in the repertoire of Greek tripod caul drons was part of an elite claim to local origins and a heroic past. 162 At Praisos, the earliest Eteocretan inscriptions date to the sixth century?earlier than any Greek texts?and this</page><page sequence="35">2009] ROUSSA EKKLESIA, PART 1 387 pressions of Eteocretan identity take any other form? Whitley considered a possible role for the terracotta industry as Praisians sought to distinguish themselves through common styles at sanctuaries within their territory.163 If an Eteocretan style can be identified, he assumed opposition to all other Cretan styles and presumably foreign models as well. Yet the quintes sentially local plaque, the male votary, has strong af finities with mainland Greek iconography and ritual practice. In addition, local ceramic workshops pro duced no special shapes or styles in the Archaic and Classical periods. Praisians used the standard Cretan drinking vessels?high-necked cups?with local em bellishments no more pronounced than at any other production center.164 This hardly amounts to a con certed effort of ethnic identification through terracot tas and ceramic styles. Eteocretan was just one example of linguistic diver gence and ethnic identification. In Homer's Odyssey (19.175-77), Eteocretans appear on the island with Akhaians, Kydonians, Dorians, and Pelasgians in 90 cities, with one language mixed with another. What, then, distinguished the "true" Cretans (Eteocretans) from other ethnic groups?165 Although most assume Eteocretan peculiarity and difference, the Praisian claim of autochthony provides evidence to the con trary, since it suggests a conceptual link between the Eteocretans, Athenians, and other Greeks who emphasized descent from Bronze Age ancestors and uninterrupted possession of territory, a strategy per haps shaped in response to Dorian myths of return.166 Herodotus (7.170) accepted the Praisian account of population fluctuations on Crete after the death of Fig. 24. Bronze votives and armor from the sanctuary on the Third Acropolis, Praisos (Bosanquet 1901-1902, pi. 10). Minos and the claim of Eteocretan exceptionalism, as did the Pythian priestess, his apparent source. Praisos does not appear quaint or provincial in this account. Rather, mainland Greeks may have regarded this polis language was still used for official documents as late as the second century, near the time of the city's destruction (Guar ducci 1942, 138-55; Duhoux 1982, 55-85; Brixhe 1991, 53 9). Stoddart and Whitley (1988, 766) estimated that no more than 300 people could read and write on archaic Crete, about three people with functional literacy for each of the 100 or so attested poleis. But even if most did not read, many inhabit ants might still have spoken Eteocretan. What may be private Eteocretan inscriptions have recently come to light at Azoria in the form of pithos handles with short texts; these and other personal inscriptions in Greek suggest a bilingual population. These inscriptions are from the 2006 season and are posted online at http://www.unc.edu/~dchaggis/Azoria%202006. html. For Greek personal inscriptions at Azoria, see Haggis et al. 2007, 312-14. ^Whitley 1998,37; 2006,609-10. 164 An exceptional class of fourth-century or later cups has a base with decoration (incised vertical marks) unlike anything else, but these probably date centuries after the terracotta plaques. Whitley (2006, 610) interpreted these cup bases as displaying a local flamboyance uncharacteristic of the austere Cretans. Pottery styles contemporary with the plaques do not seem to overlap with political or ethnic boundaries, although Coldstream (1968, 259) identified a homogenous regional style in the east with a western boundary between Neapolis and Mirabello. 165 For the etymology of the compound eteos-Kres, see Duhoux 1982, 16-18. As Whitley (2008) cautioned, Eteo cretan, a label applied by outsiders, was not necessarily what Praisians called themselves. The passage in the Odyssey is prob lematic, because it is spoken by Odysseus as he pretends to be a Cretan and lies about his travels. 166Pseudo-Kymnos (Periegesis 541), Diodorus Siculus (5.64, 5.80), and Strabo (10.4.6) all explicitly describe the Prai sians as autochthonous. Loraux (1986, 148-50, 277-78) and Thomas (1989, 217-18, 234-36) related Athenian claims of autochthony to principles of descent {eugenia) and democ racy. The people of Troizen also claimed that they were au tochthonous (Paus. 2.30.6), but they may have borrowed this concept from Athens along with the divine contest myth be tween Athena and Poseidon. For autochthony as a response to Dorian migration narratives, see Rosivach 1987,296-97.</page><page sequence="36">388 BRICE ERICKSON [AJA 113 as unusually connected to the outside world, nothing like Bosanquet's picture of Dreros, Praisos, and Palai kastro as an insular "Cretan Wales."167 Praisian pottery gives a hint of a special receptive ness to foreign styles. For example, a black-figure pinax with a horse and rider on one side and Herakles wres tling a serpent on the other may be a local product, although it is indistinguishable in style from Cycladic and mainland Greek workshops (fig. 25).168 The rarity of mythological scenes in Cretan art and the absence of figural decoration from the island's ceramic reper toires of the sixth century make this pinax exceptional. In addition, the reported discovery of an archaic tomb with two Panathenaic amphoras is noteworthy and sug gests a Praisian winner at the games.169 A link to Ath ens may also be relevant for Eteocretan autochthony myths. But what most clearly sets Praisos apart from other Cretan sites is its conformity to the international style in the production of architectural terracottas with Corinthian, Athenian, Cypriot, and Ionian influences. The terracotta simas and palmette antefixes at Praisos and Palaikastro have foreign parallels and mark a de parture from indigenous traditions of Daedalic stone relief decoration (fig. 26).170 Unlike their neighbors, temple builders at Praisos and Palaikastro embraced Archaic styles and conventions.171 Artistic styles need not signal a special commercial or political outlook. Still, it is worth noting possible differences in the pattern of foreign relations on Crete. The long east-west axis of the island seems to have encouraged the development of two distinct trade networks, one in the west with a Peloponnesian focus Fig. 25. Black-figure pinax from Praisos (Hopkinson 1903 1904, pi. 3). and the other in the east with a Cycladic orientation.172 Other sources hint at distinctions between east Cretan poleis. At Olous, local terracotta workshops copied fifth-century Rhodian types identical to examples from Lindos, and a contemporary treaty between Lindos and Lyktos, the western neighbor of Olous, raises the possibility of styles spreading through political chan nels.173 It is unclear, however, whether these sites with suspected links to Rhodes are exceptional or part of a 167For Bosanquet (1908-1909, 351; 1939-1940, 63-8), the Eteocretans were the last holdouts of Minoan culture, an in sular and strange people whose religious peculiarities were survivals from the Bronze Age with an influence on other Cre tans in depictions of a young, dying Zeus at the Idaean sanctu ary and the worship of the obscure goddess Britomartis; see also Harrison 1908-1909,329,337; 1927,16-18; Nilsson 1950, 553-58; Willetts 1962,179-93,199-220; West 1965,154-55; MacGillivray 2000, 129-30. Whitley (2007, 58-61) empha sized the Welsh background of the excavators of Palaikastro and Praisos as an explanation for their interest in the remote eastern part of the island. 168 The origin and date of this pinax are uncertain (Board man 1961,146; Schaus 1985,12). 169 For the tomb with Panathenaics, see Papadakis 1983, 83. The interpretation of Panathenaic burials in Athens and other parts of the Greek world is not straightforward. People with no connection to the Panathenaic games may have ac quired the amphoras. However, some burials with Panathena ics all from the same event raise the possibility of Panathenaic victors (Hamilton 1996,141-43; Kyle 1996,122). The import record at Praisos is otherwise not unusual. 170 For these architectural terracottas and Aegean parallels, see Winter 1993,268, pi. 107. Proposed dates for the Palaikas tro sima have ranged from the seventh to the early fifth cen turies. These architectural connections between Praisos and Palaikastro are not enough to posit Praisian control over the sanctuary at Palaikastro (Whitley 2008). The sima pictured here hints at a connection between east Crete and Magna Graecia; an example from the same mold has been found in southern Italy (unrecorded provenance). Other architec tural terracottas, including a class of antefixes decorated with heads found at Palaikastro and Morgantina, suggest Cretan influence on western production (Mertens-Horn 1992,85-8; Kenfieldl994). 171 At Praisos, Hutchinson (1939-1940, 41-2, pis. 18,19) also detected Cypriot influence in a terracotta bust of a youth from the Third Acropolis and dated it to ca. 575. For other Cretan sites, Ridgway (1993,26,30) framed the sixth-century artistic decline as a disinclination toward the new archaic style. 172Erickson (2005,636) based this conclusion on the distri bution of Peloponnesian ceramic imports to the west at Kydo nia, Eleutherna, and Knossos, and Sub-Geometric Cycladic pottery in the east at Azoria, Olous, and Itanos. 173 For the terracottas of Rhodian type, see supra n. 94.

CONCLUSION Although archaeologists have often viewed Cretan orientalizing culture in terms of class conflict and op positional elite and civic interests, activity at Praisian sanctuaries suggests a more complicated dynamic. Rather than following a predetermined and unchang ing script, Cretans during this period had contingent social roles. Elites from Praisos at times stressed a con nection to other elites outside the community through a common style. For example, at the Third Acropolis sanctuary, they dedicated bronzes similar to those at regional cult centers and the civic sanctuaries of other states. Since lavish dedications brought divine favor to the entire community, these bronzes probably did not trigger a counter reaction from the masses. Moreover, this was not an orientalizing culture in opposition to masses using a plain style. In fact, elites made only se lective use of Near Eastern iconography and styles. An exception was the Idaean cave, where a few impres sive bronze dedications asserted an explicit link to the exotic world of foreign styles, craftsmen, and rituals. Here, Cretan participants defined themselves as part of an international elite. Within their borders, how ever, members of different poleis had occasions for emphasizing group solidarity, even if elites led these ceremonies. At Vavelli and Roussa Ekklesia, terracotta styles played a role in forming local identity while also incorporating diverse foreign influences.

A famous cult statue on Rhodes may have been the model for the figurine types (Alroth 1989, 56). Later developments may help make sense of the ambiguous fifth-century relationship. According to Willetts (1962,280), the cult of Athena Lindia was part of a Rhodian diplomatic effort to secure the friend ship of certain Cretan poleis in the second century. Olous enjoyed close diplomatic relations with Rhodes in the third century and may have figured in Rhodian and Egyptian economic calculations. According to Perlman (1999,145-49), the worship of Egyptian deities on Crete points to a role for the island in Ptolemaic transit trade.</page><page sequence="38">390 BRICE ERICKSON [AJA 113 Dimensions: Ht. 9.9 cm; wdth. 5.9 cm; thickness 2.1 cm.
