<plain_text><page sequence="1">Brian Henry TO SPEAK OF WOE Review Vita Nova By Louise Gluck New York: Ecco Press, 1999. 51 pp. $22. ince her debut collection Firstborn (1968), Louise Gluck's poems have thrummed with tension-linguistic, psychological, emotional e best of them embodying those tensions simultaneously. In her most recent book, Vita Nova, she presents us with a narrator stretched to the point of breaking. The difficult persona of these poems produces an intimacy as forbidding as it is inviting, showing this poet at both her most exposed and her most aggressive: where Gluck's previous book Meadowlands (1996) dramatized the demise of the poet's marriage, Vita Nova records the aftermath. Her personae in her previous books have seemed vulnerable but powerful. Here, however, the poet's persona seems disconcertingly passive: she rarely acts but is acted upon. The outcome is a book of poems that narrate-take control of-a person's lack of control in her life, confirming her statement in her essay "Education of the Poet" that "The fundamental experience of the writer is helplessness"(3). This helplessness emerges most obviously when the poet admits to passivity: "My life took me many places, / many of them very dark. / It took me without my volition, / pushing me from behind" ("The Mystery" 46); "Where would I be without my sorrow, I sorrow of my beloved's making" ("Relic" 36); "I begin now to perceive / the nature of my soul, the soul / I inhabit as punishment" ("The New Life" 12). And the 166</page><page sequence="2">Brian Henry prevalence of dreams reinforces the poet's frequent sense of passivity. The book, though, is ultimately not passive; rather, it is an active, if flawed, accounting of the poet's desertion, or abandonment. As Lee Upton writes in her essay "Fleshless Voices: Louise Gluck's Rituals of Abjection and Oblivion": "The response of the abandoned in this poetry is to exclude and discard, to be as much the one who abandons the other and the other's conceptions as the one who suffers personal abandonment"(120). Although written before Vita Nova, Upton's remark is prescient, perhaps more applicable to this book than to any other by Gluck. The strained margin between the abandoned and the abandoner parallels Glucks identification with Penelope in Meadowlands, in which the poet imagines Penelope as not staying with Odysseus after they reunite. (In retrospect, Gluck seems more sympathetic to Circe, whom Odysseus abandoned, than to his ambivalent wife.) As in Meadowlands, Gluck interweaves mythological and contemporary life through Vita Nova, calling attention both to the mythic element of the world we inhabit and to the familiar elements of a world distant from ours. This mytho- logical construct allows Gluck to refract her narratives, to make them seem less personal and more archetypal. She is more varied and less fixed on myth in Vita Nova than in Meadowlands, with Orpheus and Eurydice, Aeneas and Dido appearing within the frames of her own life. Her recon- figurations of these characters succeed when they introduce emotion and specificity to the "facts" of myth. Although this technique is not uncom- mon among contemporary poets, Gluck's use of it delivers distinctive poetry because of the psychological particularity inherent in her approach. If mythology is less central to Vita Nova than to Gluck's books that thrive on it (Meadowlands, The Wild Iris, Ararat, The Triumph of Achilles, Descending Figure), what is central is the poet, in particular the poet's determination to make sense of her life after mother- and wifehood have given way to solitude. In a manner typical of Gliick, these poems waver between parading the self and effacing it; and in their persistent investigations of the self, they seem the products of psychoanalysis, which, according to the poet, "taught me to think. Taught me to use my tendency to object to articulated ideas on my own ideas, taught me to use doubt, to examine my own speech for its evasions and excisions" ("Education of the Poet" 12). Because of this constant self-scrutiny ("I have been in my other 167</page><page sequence="3">The Kenyon Review lives / too hasty, too eager, / ... for all my amorousness, / cold at heart" ("The New Life" 12), Gluck relies more on memory than most poets do: And I remember accurately the sequence of my responses, my eyes fixing on each thing from the shelter of the hidden self: first, I love it. Then, I can use it. ("Nest" 39) What would be problematic for many poets-the near-fetishization of a life, the determination to "use" one's life for the purposes of art-has become natural for Gluck. This marks her as something of a martyr, a per- son who suffers (like everyone else) but performs extreme intellectual feats to make use of that suffering. The result: poems that console as they take formal (i.e. stylistic) and thematic (i.e. personal) risks. One of the primary hazards of this approach is self-indulgence, or, worse, a perverse wish to attain victim status. These poems, though, depend less on the specifics of the poet's life than on her nature and how that influences her life in general: the details do not seem as important as the poet's perception(s) of the details. Because so much personal poetry relies on circumstance, it fails to transcend the circumstantial in its aspi- ration toward the "universal." Gluck, by connecting her persona to larger contexts, moves from the narrow rooms of the self outward-into history and myth, imprint and archetype. Like Gluck's primary mentor, Stanley Kunitz, in his own "Vita Nuova" (from Intellectual Things, 1930), she hopes "My dark will make ... / The single beam of all my life intense" (Collected Poems 55). Neither coolly analytical (as some critics have sug- gested) nor passionately overwrought, Gluck does not acknowledge a divide between intellect and emotion in Vita Nova, practicing instead a logic-within-emotion. This focus on the poet's mental processes also can extend to overt attention to composition, to the presentation of language in the poem: "Spring / descended. Or should one say / rose? Should one say rose up?" ("Ellsworth Avenue" 40). Such absorption with the writing process usual- ly occurs behind the scenes, so it is interesting that Gluck chooses to fore- ground this process, and in a manner similar to Jorie Graham's in The Errancy: "one ribbony with bits of valor, / or is it stringy now with blips 168</page><page sequence="4">Brian Henry of laughter?"("Untitled Two" 25). But Gluck also ends the poem with an extended variation of the poem's opening lines: "Spring / descended. Or should one say / rose up again? / Or should one say / broke from earth?"(41). This repetition as revision reminds us nothing is fixed, every- thing is subject to change-a fact as frightening as it is reassuring. Gluck's stylistic self-consciousness also courts change. Her style in this book seems her most plain-spoken and direct, albeit subtly wrought. Because she does not write in traditional forms or pursue the more sonorous possibilities of poetry, her lyricism, when it works, works through repetition and whittling, through the accumulation and divesti- ture of sound. "Evening Prayers" demonstrates the Gluck of Vita Nova at her most lyrical: I believe my sin to be entirely common: the request for help masking request for favor and the plea for pity thinly veiling complaint. (34) The repetition of "request for" mirrors the repetition, later in the poem, of "I believe my sin is common." Although the language itself does not sing, these lines clearly are poetry: converting them into prose would destroy the autonomy of each line as well as the power derived from the syntacti- cal tension afforded by the line breaks. Add an alternate dimeter/trimeter, scattered iambs ("believe my sin," "request for help") and iambs with feminine endings ("request for favor," "the plea for pity"), consonance ("masking request," "plea ... thinly ... complaint"), alliteration ("plea for pity"), and off-rhyme ("pity" / "thinly," "favor" / "plea for"), and the result is a free verse that obfuscates its intricacy through plain language and flat cadences. Throughout Vita Nova, Gluck makes worthwhile use of the most fundamental technique of poetry-repetition (in her case often through anaphora and chiasmus)-and shows she knows how to repeat herself without repeating herself: "Once is enough. Once is enough / to say good- bye on earth" (48); "I don't know who I was anymore / ... I didn't know where I was"; "You saved me, you should remember me. / ... You changed me, you should remember me"(1); "a chip of something, with / the self at the center. // And at the center of the self, / grief I thought I couldn't 169</page><page sequence="5">The Kenyon Review survive"(3); "I lived / not completely alone, alone / but not completely" (14). This anaphoraic, rhetorical free verse reveals an aspiration toward symmetry and the qualities of music, and it is through music-through the repetition of sounds and emotion-that the poet seeks solace. In nearly every poem, Gluck looks to poetry-to song-for consolation in the face of loss, but acknowledges "our consolations are the costliest thing" ("Relic" 36). Consolation costs because it forces us to acknowledge wrongs-ours and others'. Therefore, these poems court, in her own words (from "The Idea of Courage" 25) "the possibility of shame," which is a tremendous risk for any person, especially one as habitually reticent as Gluck. Her desire for solace through the linguistic and emotional / intel- lectual properties of poetry carries her across the chasm of consolation, stunned but intact. The strongest aspect of Gluck's style in Vita Nova stems from her open dialogue with herself in five of the book's most compelling poems- "The Burning Heart," "Inferno," "Timor Mortis," "Earthly Terror," "Mutable Earth." These poems pivot on questions and answers, particu- larly on the give-and-take possible in the form in which everything hinges on friction, on the music and sparks generated by the questions and the poet's responses to them. In moments of intense emotion, the poet's per- sona fails to answer, or answers obliquely, the questions posed to her: But do you think you're free? I think I recognize the patterns of my nature. But do you think you're free? I had nothing and I was still changed. Like a costume, my numbness was taken away. Then hunger was added. ("Mutable Earth" 30) Here, Gluck's first answer attempts to deflect the question about-and the issue of-freedom. The importance of the question and the poet's unwillingness (or inability) to answer it are illuminated when the question is repeated, all the more urgent for the repetition. But Gluck still does not answer the question, at least not openly. What seems at first like evasion, however, is actually more revealing through the details chosen by the poet, 170</page><page sequence="6">Brian Henry who speaks in terms of possession, transformation, pain, and the removal of pain. This self-interrogation powerfully echoes Frank Bidart's "Confessional" since the questions "Did you forgive her?" and "Why are you angry?" recur in Bidart's poem and are either ignored or answered obliquely by the narrator. The language of "Mutable Earth" and other poems in Vita Nova also recalls several passages from Bidart's long poem "The War of Vaslav Nijinsky," particularly the lines "In Suffering and Nightmare, /I woke at last //to my own nature"(31). The author of Vita Nova resembles no living poet more than Bidart, who writes in "Golden State": "When I began this poem, . . . / I sensed I had to become not merely / a speaker, the 'eye,' but a character. . ." (162). Like Bidart, Gluck has become a character in her own "psychological autobiography" (Upton's phrase); and both poets go to great pains-through artifice and rhetoric-to make their verse seem colloquial, their painful insights almost elegant, easily achieved. This deep similarity surprises because each poet seems so unique, stylistically and intellectually. The book's closing poem, "Vita Nova," which shares its name with the opening poem, must be the strangest poem of Gluck's career. Alternately self-excoriating and accusatory, sad and indignant, the speaker addresses her lost lover (as Dante does in his Vita Nuova), not in "reality" nor from the world of the poem, but from a dream: "In the splitting up dream / we were fighting over who would keep / the dog, / Blizzard ... ." (50). The uneven lines seem mimetic of the poet's own confusion through- out the poem: nothing is clear in the dream; nothing is clear in the poem. By appropriating dream logic, Gluck is able to accuse simultaneously her lover and herself: Who wiXl explain this to the dog? Blizzard, Daddy needs you; Daddy's heart is empty, not because he's leaving Mommy but because the kind of love he wants Mommy doesn't have, Mommy's too ironic-Mommy wouldn't do the rhumba in the driveway. (50) These lines, both pathetic (in the poet's self-judgment as being "too ironic," inadequate) and bathetic (in the anthropomorphism of the dog and its inclusion in the human drama), seem uncertain of the effect they 171</page><page sequence="7">The Kenyon Review seek; they sway between sadness and humor. The poem continues to stagger, with the poet "supposing / I'm the dog, as in / my child-self, unconsolable because / completely pre-verbal" and then addressing the dog (and therefore herself): "O Blizzard, / be a brave dog-this is / all material." Again, the sense that Gluck exhaustively mines memory and experience for her poetry comes to the fore; however, what seems like revelation earlier in the book has become suspect, nearly predictable, not only to the reader but, I'm convinced, to the poet, who must realize the dangers of using her life so thoroughly and of admitting to the practice in her poems. This poem confirms her observation that "Life is very weird, no matter how it ends, / very filled with dreams"; and its weirdness continues to its close: "I thought my life was over and my heart was broken. / Then I moved to Cambridge"(51). These lines-the only italicized lines in the poem-have no owner; it is not clear who speaks them. In any case, they seem to beg for a sequel to Vita Nova, serv- ing as a "to be continued" in the poet's personal saga. Without knowing details of the poet's life, a reader would not be able to know absolutely whose words end the book. By ending with such uncertainty, Gluck again becomes complicitous in her own story, in its limitations, ambiguities, and consolations. Works Cited Bidart, Frank.
