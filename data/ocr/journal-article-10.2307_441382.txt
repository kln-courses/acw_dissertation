<plain_text><page sequence="1">How Do We Know That We Know What We Know in Tom Stoppard's Jumpers? BARBARA KREPS Opening with a swinger of a secretary who peels toward the buff on a makeshift trapeze suspended from a chandelier and with a bunch of gymnasts who pile on top of each other to form a human pyramid until one of them is mysteriously shot out from the bottom,Tom Stoppard's Jumpers gets off to an undeniably muscular start; but when the play is over, certainly the most impressive gymnastics on display are far and away those performed by the author's agile mind. Such somber subjects as ethics and epistemology take on an unexpectedly funny aspect, as Stoppard's wit percolates through concepts normally accorded more reverential treatment. Jumpers stimulates a great deal of hilarity, but it also gives us a glimpse of what a world without ethical brakes would be like-and though we laugh at the witty phrasing, the vision itself is far from funny. The play poses serious questions about both the basis and the limits of human knowledge, human values, and human behavior; but it fails to answer its own questions, and a few critics feel uneasy that so much that is important simply stays up in the air in the end and suspect that Tom Thinker was not up to the job he had taken on and had given it over to Tom Trickster.' They do not begrudge Stoppard's playing with so many of our assumptions: that is, after all, one of comedy's fundamental prerogatives. But they feel the playing ought finally to lead somewhere, and obviously Jumpers does not do that. All we get is a moratorium on argument: George's "STOP!," Archie's unreassuring 187</page><page sequence="2">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE "Do not despair" speech, and Dotty's melancholy farewell to both the moon and the audience. Clearly there is a strong prejudice, which we are meant to side with, toward what George has to say about God and Good and the way he knows them; but we are left, when all is done, with the uneasy recognition that the play talks in a direction that its action contradicts. In part, this contradiction is due to Stoppard's depiction of George as a decidedly flawed hero; but our perplexity is finally due, I think, to our perceptions not only of the several and contradictory ways knowledge relates to ethical behavior, but also to the revelation that all the ways of "knowing" explored in the play can lead to error as well as to truth while, in the realm of ethics, good intention counts for everything, but it can also count for nothing. The problem of knowing common to Jumpers' multiple plots (all in their own ways concerned with clearing up mysteries) becomes linked to the irony of intention through the complex relationship between appearance and reality in the play. The basic irony, of course, is that a man who is totally unaware of the mysteries going on under his own roof should be engaged in a serious effort to penetrate the "two quite unconnected mysteries" of "the God of Creation" and "the God of Goodness" (pp. 25-26).2 For George learns only at a ridiculously late stage in the play that Duncan McFee is dead and that he has been killed in George's own living room possibly by George's own wife. Moreover, of all the characters on stage, George is the only one never to see the extremely visible corpse. George is thus frequently funny despite the overriding seriousness of his own intentions. Yet even though Stoppard's structure works so constantly against his professor, we never consider writing George off. On the contrary, even though we all see and know how much George fails to see, and therefore does not know, of reality, most of us listen with sympathy and shared belief to what he says to us about knowing and reality. Still, George's philosophical inquiries are surrounded by a number of unknowns that, because they lie so literally close to home, necessarily throw ironic reflexes across George's attempts to penetrate the arcane: not only the murder of Duncan McFee, but the whereabouts of Thumper and whether Dotty and Archie are or are not having an affair are other mysteries posed by the play, mysteries that would seem more accessible to verification than George's grapplings with God and the ultimate nature of good. But what happened to Thumper is the only question about which we can have no final doubts. The play sets up several suspects, but stops short of telling us who murdered Duncan, and though Stoppard makes it difficult to believe that Dotty's and 188</page><page sequence="3">TOM STOPPARD'S JUMPERS Archie's relationship is as innocent as they claim, even about them the play leaves us uncertain. For as George himself reminds us when he relates the following anecdote about Wittgenstein (later cannibalized by Archie when he explains that he is "dermatographing" Dotty), appearances provide no sure basis for assumptions about reality: Meeting a friend in a corridor, Wittgenstein said: "Tell me, why do people always say it was natural for men to assume that the sun went round the earth rather than that the earth was rotating?" His friend said, "Well, obviously, because it just looks as if the sun is going round the earth." To which the philosopher replied, "Well, what would it have looked like if it had looked as if the earth was rotating?" (p. 75) Kenneth Tynan recounts that in rehearsal Jumpers was turning out to be overlong, and that to meet the problem he himself, as house dramaturge at the National Theatre, "dictated to the cast a series of cuts and transpositions which reduced the text to what I considered a manageable length."3 The Wittgenstein anecdote seems to be one of the cuts he was originally considering. Fortunately a great deal of material regarding the production of Jumpers has been conserved in the archives of the National Theatre where, among other things, I found the script first consigned to the actors, typed memos from "K.T.," and six handwritten pages (two outlining script changes and deletions plus four of brief reflections on the cuts proposed) which may be the revisions Tynan was referring to.4 On the first of the two pages that note 262 lines to be cut we find "2.21: Wittgenstein (13 lines)." (The numbers refer to pagination in the house text.) This line has been crossed out, however, obviously because of the objection on the fourth yellow page, "Hard to cut Wittgenstein." And so Wittgenstein remained. The anecdote is addressed point-blank to the audience rather than to the other characters on stage, and does not fit into plot events at the moment it is recounted; but despite this seeming break in the text I think that one reason Wittgenstein could not be cut-aside from the fact that the interruption heads off some sticky problems in both plot and ideology (a point I will come back to later)--is because the anecdote expresses so well the essence of Stoppard's vision in Jumpers. The fact that there are truths that we simply know, even though we cannot prove them, is an important concept in the play; but so too is just the opposite point-that we are often sure we know something about which we are in fact mistaken. This lesson is offered on both sides of the footlights. For most of the play Stoppard privileges the audience, in the time-honored 189</page><page sequence="4">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE fourth-wall tradition, with a knowledge of conversations and events in the Moore household that is (or so it seems) decidedly superior to George's, and the dislocation between his perceptions and the audience's is one of the play's sources of laughter. George, the professor of knowing, simply does not know a great deal that his audience does, and he remains unaware of just how much he does not know until he takes that fatal step at the end of Act II and blacks out into the dream Coda, presumably from the shock of discovering that he has inadvertently killed both of his beloved pets. Volition, George discovers, does not necessarily dictate event, and a person can do things he never intended to do: that is a shocking revelation to George of limits he never suspected in his moral code. But this unexpected turn of events is just as shocking for the audience, and by the end of Jumpers they discover that George is not the only one for whom Stoppard has been laying traps about knowing. Stoppard confessed in a now much-quoted interview published by Theatre Quarterly in 1974 that one of his aims in writing is to set "ambushes for the audience," an aim obviously achieved in Jumpers. For if at the end the audience is caught unaware it is because Stoppard has worked so hard from the beginning to make them unaware. He skillfully exploits the audience's tendency to believe what they think they have seen to provide the starting point of the play's action; when the play is over, however, the audience's misinterpretation of matters they have been sure about also elucidates in retrospect one of the play's principal points about knowledge and belief. At the beginning of the printed editions of Jumpers, Stoppard provides detailed instructions about the set and its furnishings, though his final directive is that "none of the above is visible for the first few minutes of the play, for which is required an empty space. . ." (p. 14). Except for a spotlight trained on Dotty and the Jumpers, the stage is in darkness when Duncan's murder takes place, a fact of obvious importance to the audience's interpretation of much that follows. After all, the audience seated in the theater did not have the benefit of a hint buried in the printed stage directions that what one sees is limited and therefore may not be very useful for getting at truth: from her position in the near-dark outside the JUMPERS' light, it should be possible to believe that DOTTY is responsible for what happens next- which is: A gun shot. ONE JUMPER, bottom row, second front left, is blown out of the pyramid. 190</page><page sequence="5">TOM STOPPARD'S JUMPERS He falls downstage, leaving the rest of the pyramid intact. The music has stopped. DOTTY, chanteuse, walks through the gap in the pyramid. What we see not only makes it "possible to believe" that Dotty killed Duncan, but for most of the play leaves us and many of the play's characters with absolutely no doubt that she did so. We never totally release Dotty from our suspicions, but the introduction of new evidence late in the play enlarges the list of suspects and makes her seem the least likely of them. Archie plants the first seeds of doubt when he tells Bones that he had his own reasons for wanting to eliminate Duncan. But if for a time Archie deflects our suspicions from Dotty, a third possible culprit emerges unexpectedly at the end of Act II, when McFee's secret affair with George's secretary is revealed. "A grim, tense, unsmiling woman," she stares into the audience as Crouch recounts the history of her unhappy affair with Duncan and "snaps her handbag shut with a sharp sound" of finality at the precise moment Crouch says "And now he's dead." What can we deduce from appearances? The stage business underlines the probability that the secretary is the assassin, but it is certainly not proof, and Stoppard teases his audience at just this point with Archie's pronouncement about the difference between mystery novels and life: The truth to us philosophers, Mr. Crouch, is always an interim judgement. We will never even know for certain who did shoot McFee. Unlike mystery novels, life does not guarantee a denouement; and if it came how would one know whether to believe it? (p. 81). If for a moment the sight of blood on the secretary's coat convinces the audience that they know more than Archie does, the "evidence" turns out to be yet another of Stoppard's ambushes, for the blood is soon revealed to be not Duncan's but Thumper's. The text as played in 1972 signals the secretary as Duncan's probable murderer, but we can never know with certainty. Tynan was disturbed by the ambiguity and complained about it in two behind-the- scenes memos sent to Stoppard, Sir Laurence Olivier, and director Peter Wood. In the undated memo ("A few proposals after the run-through, based on the conviction that even when the technical problems are solved, we shall still be overlength"), Tynan's fifth proposal reads: "I know Tom's objection to this, but I still maintain that to set up a whodunit and not reveal whodidit is very confusing. The audience will feel cheated." In the memo dated January 19 ("Three 191</page><page sequence="6">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE more thoughts about JUMPERS"), this objection was more fully explained: Even if Tom rejects the idea of saying who did it, I'm certain that there should be at least a statement to the effect that it doesn't matter who did it. As things stand, the question we've been asking all evening is simply ignored at the end. I don't think it can be set aside so lightly-not only for theatrical reasons, but also because murder is a crime against morality and one of our main themes is the validity of morality. Tynan did not get his way on this point. Indeed, when the play was revived in 1976 for its third National Theatre production, the secretary's business with the purse as Crouch reveals her secret does not appear in the stage directions, an omission that weakens the 1972 tendency toward a "mystery novel denouement" and emphasizes the play's concern for demonstrating the difficulty of knowing. Though Stoppard's theatrical ambushes reinforce one line of Jumpers' epistemology by uncovering the pitfalls of taking anything for granted, the play's ethical argument defends not only the validity but the necessity of values we can intuit but not verify. The play's allegiance to both points militates against a definitive resolution for or against either and, as George is caught in the middle of this ongoing dialectic, he cuts an incongruous figure. He is-at least up until the Coda-the play's only ethical standard-bearer and, though we sometimes laugh at the way he expresses himself, our own instincts approve and applaud when he holds out against his pragmatic adversaries his simple truth that though the desire to act well may be scientifically unexplainable, it is nonetheless a human reality to be found in all societies, from the most primitive to the most technologically complex. George knows instinc- tively that certain moral values simply exist, which give rise in turn to such impulses as "honour . . . pride, shame, fellow-feeling, generosity and love" (p. 55). This much is anthropologically verifiable, but why these values exist is a separate question: "Whence comes this sense of some actions being better than others?-not more useful, or more convenient, or more popular, but simply pointlessly better? What, in short, is so good about good?" (p. 55). Unlike his onomastic predecessor (who in the Principia Ethica disavowed any connection between metaphysics and ethics), the George Moore of Jumpers thinks that in order to find the answer to "what is so good about good" the question of God must be admitted, though Stoppard gives him an odd way of phrasing it: I sometimes wonder whether the question ought not to be, "Are 192</page><page sequence="7">TOM STOPPARD'S JUMPERS God?" Because it is to account for two quite unconnected mysteries that the human mind looks beyond humanity and it is two of him that philosophy obligingly provides. There is, first, the God of Creation to account for existence, and, second, the God of Goodness to account for moral values. I say they are unconnected because there is no logical reason why the fountainhead of goodness in the universe should have necessarily created the universe in the first place; nor is it necessary, on the other hand, that a Creator should care tuppence about the behaviour of his creations. Still, at least in the Judaeo-Christian tradition, nothing is heard either of a God who created the universe and then washed his hands of it, or, alternatively a God who merely took a comparatively recent interest in the chance product of universal gases. In practice, people admit a Creator to give authority to moral values, and admit moral values to give point to the Creation. (pp. 25-26) But since this is the century that has officially proclaimed God dead, George is aware that there is a certain amount of embarrassment in the position of an intellectual who wishes to resurrect Him: "There is presumably a calendar date-a moment-when the onus of proof passed from the atheist to the believer, when, quite suddenly, secretly the noes had it. (And squeezes a blackhead in the imaginary mirror. Then he straightens up and is the lecturer again.)" (p. 25). What we see here, as so often in the play, is that George's sensibilities and Stoppard's are in a comic clash. George is quite earnest about everything he says and he lacks anything resembling a sense of humor, but the somber delivery he aims for is frequently not the tone he achieves. For George's serious and orthodox questions about God and good have to filter through Stoppard's comically unorthodox way of phrasing them: "Are God?"; the anthropomorphic reductio ad absurdum of a God who cares (or else does not) about tuppence and gas; a God who perhaps "washed his hands" of moral responsibility (an audacious linguistic turnabout, considering how the phrase originated). George as thinker is perforce stuck with the fact that Stoppard is always there putting words into his mouth. And at the very moment George is seriously wrestling with the difficulty of faith in the modern world, Stoppard afflicts him with an urge to squeeze a blackhead, presumably on his nose "the noes had it"). Nor do George's ideas remain greatly consistent if Stoppard sees a joke coming on. Thus on ethical questions George backs the instincts of nonphilosophical common man against "the prevailing temper of modern philosophy" while Stoppard peppers George's attempt at straightforward professional logic with comically 193</page><page sequence="8">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE unexpected examples of bungalows and teak boxes (a phrase that distances and diffuses into laughter what is unlaughable in the lexically more exact phrase "teak coffins"): Certainly a tribe which believes it confers honour on its elders by eating them is going to be viewed askance by another which prefers to buy them a little bungalow somewhere, and Professor McFee should not be surprised that the notion of honour should manifest itself so differently in peoples so far removed in clime and in culture. What is surely more surprising is that notions such as honour should manifest themselves at all. For what is honour? What are pride, shame, fellow-feeling, generosity and love? If they are instincts, what are instincts? The prevailing temper of modern philosophy is to treat the instinct as a sort of terminus for any train of thought that seeks to trace our impulses to their origins. But what can be said to be the impulse of a genuinely altruistic act? Hobbes might have answered self-esteem, but what is the attraction or the point in thinking better of oneself. What is better? A savage who elects to honour his father by eating him as opposed to disposing of his body in some-to him-ignominious way, for example by burying it in a teak box, is making an ethical choice in that he believes himself to be acting as a good savage ought to act. Whence comes this sense of some actions being better than others? . . . Professor McFee succeeds only in showing us that in different situations different actions will be deemed, rightly or wrongly, to be conducive to that which is independent of time and place and which is knowable but not nameable. (pp. 54-55) On the question of God's existence, however, George's view of common sense is tinged with denigration: A small number of men, by the exercise of their intellects and by the study of the works both of nature and of other intellects before them, have been able to argue coherently against the existence of God. A much larger number of men, by the exercise of their emotional and psychological states, have affirmed that this is the correct view. This view derives partly from what is known as common sense, whose virtue, uniquely among virtues, is that everybody has it, and partly from the mounting implausibility of a technological age as having divine origins-for while a man might believe that the providence of sheep's wool was made in heaven, he finds it harder to believe the same of Terylene mixture. (p. 25) In playing, of course, it is a discrepancy not likely to be noticed. What we do notice-consistently-is the tension between George's single-track mind and the multitrack world, which generates so much of the play's 194</page><page sequence="9">TOM STOPPARD'S JUMPERS laughter. George never gets over his wistful nostalgia for the days of the lamb's lost innocence, and though Stoppard makes George appealing for just this reason, he also dramatizes a world beyond the walls of George's study with tigers even more fearful than Terylene mixture. Indeed, the clash between innocence and experience, which George implicitly acknowledges here in his contrast of the pastoral with the technological, lies behind most of what takes place in Jumpers. Jim Hunter, who has noted a pattern of "comic collision" in Stoppard's plays, observes that what we often find in Stoppard is the contrast between a "self-contained logic" and "the mess, contingency, and awkwardness of the real world."5 George's desire to remain undisturbed in his study is a physical sign of the kind of "self-contained logic" Hunter speaks of, but Stoppard's split stage is a constant reminder that George lives in a world of contradictions with which the professor fails to come to terms. George is the only character we are permitted to admire in Jumpers, but Stoppard sends various signals that George's message and George as medium are not necessarily on the same plane (a point that will be illustrated more fully in my discussion of the Coda). A great deal of the comedy of Jumpers resides in how Stoppard sabotages George along the way, but there are also a few significant moments when he lets George have his say without undercutting him. When the play is over we all know that Stoppard basically shares George's contention that there is more to man's existence than the materialists' arguments allow. George's major philosophical antagonists are, of course, the logical positivists, whose dismissal of metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics derived from their claim that metaphysical, ethical, and aesthetic statements are not subject to verification, and are therefore meaningless. Their assault on these traditional areas of philosophical inquiry came principally through an aggressive analysis of the language in which statements about them are made. It is because of this importance language assumed in the positivists' method that George is so concerned with pointing out the limitations of language: "language is an approximation of meaning and not a logical symbolism for it" (p. 24); "language is a finite instrument crudely applied to an infinity of ideas" (p. 63); and, anticipating McFee's arguments at the symposium: he goes on to show . . . that the word "good" has also meant different things to different people at different times, an exercise which combines simplicity with futility in a measure he does not apparently suspect, for on the one hand it is not a statement 195</page><page sequence="10">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE which anyone would dispute, and on the other, nothing useful can be inferred from it. It is not in fact a statement about value at all; it is a statement about language and how it is used in a particular society. (p. 54) In short, as George's disquisition on the various meanings of "the word 'good' " indicates (cf. pp. 66-67), the problem with the positivists is that they treat "the word 'good'" only as a word. Part of George's trouble with language is that he wants to pin it down so that equivocations about such things as the difference between a good bacon sandwich and the Good Samaritan would not occur. But unfortunately for George, language will not do that-particularly when Stoppard is writing it-and so he is stuck with being George Moore, a philosopher whose wife's name is Dorothy, but not the George Moore (a philosopher whose wife's name was Dorothy), in a world where the late Bertrand Russell was never late and George's own proof that God exists depends on accepting an equation in which God is nought (this latter paradox must not have been fully enough appreciated by the early audiences, since in 1976 Stoppard makes George pause and add in perplexity "that can't be right"). Both Stoppard and George are equally aware that language plays tricks on its users. But if Stoppard has emerged as a master writer of comedy because of this fact, George finds himself not totally at ease with language in his own profession. This is certainly evident to us during the preparation of his paper for the symposium, when George starts, stops, and begins again, constantly floundering about and never quite discovering how to buckle his life jacket securely in the sea of speech; and George openly admits to Bones this fact of his discomfort with language: GEORGE: I had hoped to set British moral philosophy back forty years, which is roughly when it went off the rails, but unfortunately, though my convictions are intact and my ideas coherent, I can't seem to find the words . . . BONES: Well, "Are God?" is wrong for a start. GEORGE: Or rather, the words betray the thoughts they are supposed to express. Even the most generalized truth begins to look like special pleading as soon as you trap it in language. (p. 46) And yet, though George is not fully comfortable in what twentieth- century philosophers have called "the language game," he acquiesces in playing one with his wife all the same. But then the charades he and Dotty play only show up how little they are really communicating-a point made with comic brilliance when George's unexpected entry into 196</page><page sequence="11">TOM STOPPARD'S JUMPERS the bedroom might have led to his discovery of the Jumper's body and, hence, of his wife's predicament: (As GEORGE opens the door, DOTTY calmly lets her robe slip down her back until it hangs like a drape below her buttocks, her arms, still in the sleeves, held out to the sides; thus concealing the JUMPERfrom view. Thus, she is naked from the thighs up, back view. GEORGE glances casually at her as he crosses the room.) GEORGE: Bottom? (DOTTY lifts the robe to cover her bottom.) Back.. . . Somebody's back ... ? (He picks up the tortoise. DOTTY turns to look at him coquettishly over her shoulder. He is recrossing the room towards the door.) Lulu's back!--in town-Very good! (He leaves, closing the door, and re-enters the Study.) A good visual gag, it is also a practical illustration in theatrical terms of how "the language game" can hide from view a truth that everyone in the theater knows is there. Language is only one of the forces of opposition to George's affirmation that there are ideals and absolutes, however, and though from George's point of view language may be bothersome, it never constitutes a threat that could seriously undermine George's (or the audience's) conviction that moral imperatives exist. In the end, the really formidable antagonist to George's position lies not in "the language game" but in the large television screen against the bedroom wall: a brilliant stroke of theater, the televised struggle between the two astronauts takes the problems attending "idealism" and "pragmatism" out of the realm of theory and shows what they can mean in human practice. This is an important point, but it has been strangely ignored. Critics recall the historically finer Oates and Scott, whose heroism on the Antarctic expedition is ironically reversed by their namesakes on the moon, and they find in the moon-men two more components of that jaded materialistic world headed by Archie and the Rad-Libs, an unprincipled bunch against which George conducts his solitary but admirable battle for ideals.6 The description is true, as far as it goes, but the astronauts' role is also more complex than that. One direction of the ironic light they shed on the play's moral arguments certainly comes from their names and nasty behavior, but quite another reflex comes from the way they are bound into the play's structure. We see the astronauts in the first few minutes of playing and, 197</page><page sequence="12">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE though our attention is not focused on them again until the end of Act II, when they reemerge it is in a context which reveals that, notwithstanding the tininess of their role, the astronauts present important limits and conditions for Jumpers' action and argument-not only because of their effect on Dotty, but because they point to a blind spot (which Stoppard dramatizes as both literal and figurative) in George's ethical argument. The astronauts are a significant ambush, because their struggle for survival, which George never sees, demonstrates in radical terms that the issue George has been debating all night is not a mere matter of armchair theorizing. Stoppard, of all people, knows how easy it can be just to talk. But one of the main points Jumpers finally makes is that ethical discourse does not mean very much if it is not translated into action. Skin-saving Captain Scott represents on the moon the new Rad-Lib age of unprincipled materialism George so rightly fights against in his study, but at the same time he also represents a reality that George quite literally does not see and so does not take into account as he prepares his talk on "Man-good, bad, or indifferent?." Dotty, however, has seen the events on the moon and, as we share her knowledge, we have to admit that Stoppard affirms what Dotty says when she hurls her challenge at George's fine idealism near the end of the play: Man is on the Moon, his feet on solid ground, and he has seen us whole, all in one go, little-local . . . and all our absolutes, the thou-shalts and the thou-shalt-nots that seemed to be the very condition of our existence, how did they look to two moonmen with a single neck to save between them? Like the local customs of another place. When that thought drips through to the bottom, people won't just carry on. There is going to be such . breakage, such gnashing of unclean meats, such covetting of neighbours' oxen and knowing of neighbours' wives, such dishonourings of mothers and fathers, and bowings and scrapings to images graven and incarnate, such killing of goldfish and maybe more--(Looks up, tear-stained.) Because the truths that have been taken on trust, they've never had edges before, there was no vantage point to stand on and see where they stopped. (p. 75) George has been preparing himself all along for his professional antagonist McFee, but to Dotty's very practical objections he has no answer (as we shall see, only in part because he does not know what she is talking about)-and so it is here, in fact, that he turns away from what is happening on stage to address his non sequitur Wittgenstein anecdote to the audience. 198</page><page sequence="13">TOM STOPPARD'S JUMPERS Dotty has had ideals about the moon, as well as a successful career singing about them. But seeing what amounts to murder telecast from space unhinges her romantic notions of a "spooney Juney moon" and causes her to stumble, like her philosopher husband, on the words central to her career; but whereas George tries to plod through the lexical confusion and manages despite it to maintain his equanimity, Dotty cannot. For though George "can't seem to find the words," he still succeeds, as he assured Bones, in keeping his "convictions . . . intact" and his "ideas coherent." For Dotty, though, the intrusion of reality defaces her ideal moon to the point that she cannot put the words together any more to celebrate it, and so her career comes to an end. But if Dotty and her career are so disabled by Captain Scott's pragmatic choice, Stoppard makes things easier for George by never forcing him to see or comment on the happenings on the moon. The text as finally played and printed did not underscore George's ignorance of the astronauts. But the original script contained a dialogue between Dotty and George (subsequently deleted) which explicitly signaled George's myopia to the audience. The cross-purpose dialogue reproduced below is taken from pages 1.20 and 1.21 of the original version conserved in the National Theatre archives (the first and last lines of which appear back to back on page 38 of the 1973 Faber and Faber version): GEORGE: What happened to the old Archbishop? DOTTY: He abdicated . . . or resigned or uncoped himself- the terminology lags behind the fact. GEORGE: (thoughtfully) Dis-mantled himself, perhaps. DOTTY: At any rate, he stepped down from the pulpit, after roundly abusing the government for its equivocation on everything from the corruption of the police to the moon murder, as he insisted on calling it. GEORGE: Another one? I can't bear it, the thought of all those poor little typists and nurses strangled in the rhododendrons . . . (handwriting appears here in the margin: "New line. 'What moon murder' "). DOTTY: The moon murder. He said it would be on all our consciences if the moon man wasn't brought to trial. GEORGE: The newspapers are largely to blame. DOTTY: What are you talking about? GEORGE: If you encourage people to associate a full moon with madness, the more impressionable among them will convince themselves that they are helpless to curb their natural appetites for sexual assault and it's bound to lead to tragic excesses. 199</page><page sequence="14">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE DOTTY: Where the hell have you been for the last two days? (GEORGE is suddenly galvanised by the sense of time being lost; he darts towards the window where he left, or perhaps whither has crept, his tortoise. After his next line, DOTTY changes channel to the Moon Programme, so GEORGE'S "good God!" (below) co-incides with the change of image on the Screen, to a lunar landscape.) GEORGE: (moving to window) You know perfectly well I have been working on my- (Screen changes. GEORGE recoils from window.) Good God! DOTTY: Has it all changed to a lunar landscape? GEORGE: (at window) I can actually see Clegthorpe!--marching along, attended by two chaplains in belted raincoats. A memo of January 24, with the heading "some cuts and changes to be considered. Coda to be discussed," contains this further comment on the recently excised parts of the script: 1.21 "The local idea of a sane action" [Though crossed out in the production script, this was finally kept. See below and Faber, p. 38] seems to depend on the passage we have cut abt the moon murder. I think this might be the moment to tell the audience (if they really didn't register the TV tape) what happened on the moon. This:- D: Still an open question: red carpet or black maria? What does one do about Dot: Poor moonman, falling home like Lucifer. And it's still an open question whether he's met with a red carpet or a black maria. What does one do about a man who leaves his companion to die on the moon, like that, fighting like animals for the only place in a capsule coming home on half power? a clapped-out capsule coming home at half cock? Was it a crime? Or good sense? Or a moment of madness? Of course, to somebody on it, the moon is always full, so the local idea of a sane action may well differ from ours . . . And so on. I think this works. With 50 new words! But as Paul insists on saying, you can't not have any no cake and er eat it. In the end this revision was not adopted, probably because a specific invitation to the audience consciously to weigh the question: "Was it a crime? Or good sense? Or a moment of madness?," coming so early, could seriously undermine George's position for the rest of the play. That is to say, the audience had to know about the astronauts but at the same time not have the chance to register their full significance: as the 200</page><page sequence="15">TOM STOPPARD'S JUMPERS memo implies, the cake had to be there, but if the audience ate it too soon it would spoil their appetite for what follows-and so it was structurally preferable at this point to have, as the memo puts it, "no cake." The presence of the astronauts poses from the beginning a serious test for George's humanitarian values, but that challenge is obviously best verbalized at the end, after George's values have had a chance to be completely aired and to enjoy audience acceptance. Stoppard refused to present a one-sided argument and insisted on dramatizing the problems inherent in George's values, but his sympathies are obviously on George's side. This is clear, since even late in the play Stoppard does what he can to salvage George as long as possible. For the Wittgenstein anecdote is, in essence, a diversionary tactic, a smoke screen for the audience, provided by the author to allow George to sneak out of the ideological hole the author himself had dug for him-but in the end it is only a stopgap measure. Stoppard permits his professor to live out the play in ignorance of what has happened on the moon, but by including the astronauts from the beginning Stoppard provides not only an ironic background to George's idealistic argument, but also an implicit challenge to George's stated values-a challenge that in some form or other George and his partisans in the audience must eventually be made to recognize. It is this consideration that leads me to take up the question of the Coda. Because of its structural clumsiness, the Coda perplexes most people who write about the play. The Coda is clearly anticlimactic and, as production memos in the archives attest, the problem was recognized and discussed a number of times behind the scenes at the National Theatre. By the time Jumpers opened in 1972, the Coda had already undergone radical revision; when the play went into rehearsal the Coda was fifteen pages long, as opposed to the five pages it was finally chopped down to in the house's performance text (with some extremely minor variations, the 1972 Faber printing gives us this text on pages 83-89). The original version of the Coda included testimony by Lord Greystoke-better known to the public as Tarzan-on the questions of instinct and relative values in the jungle. Point 10 of Tynan's undated memo reads: "I think the Coda is too long and looks at times merely facetious-e.g. Tarzan. I could really do without him, especially as his swinging entrance detracts from Dotty's swinging entrance minutes later." Tynan was right. There are some good gags in the Tarzan bit (e.g., to Archie's "tell my lord what sort of things stirred your deepest feelings 201</page><page sequence="16">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE of approval and disapproval" Tarzan responds, "Well, bananas were good, and boa constrictors were bad"), but the whole thing is woefully inappropriate at this point, and only the actor playing Tarzan could harbor any regrets for his disappearance from the Coda. As Tynan pointed out, Tarzan was a distraction, in terms of both thought and theater. Cutting away ten of the original fifteen pages was an admission that the Coda presented serious problems, but even such drastic surgery did not finally satisfy. Having to think about the text once again, Stoppard himself was evidently convinced that difficulties remained, and he took the trouble to go back and revise the play's end yet again, when Jumpers was presented for the second time by the National Theatre, a change Stoppard discusses in the February 1973 "Postscript" to the "Author's Note" that prefaces the play. Even this revised version fails to make the Coda seem other than a structural flaw, however. But since Stoppard thought about the Coda enough to cut certain portions without seeing fit to suppress the Coda altogether, we ought to ask why he insisted on keeping the Coda-particularly since close attention to structure is a salient feature of all of his other plays, even the nuts-and-bolts comedies he dismisses as slight works. Evidently Stoppard felt that what happens in the Coda is too significant to be excluded, and so he kept it, despite his own recognition of the structural problems it creates. The Coda represents on stage the dream that comes to George as a result of his fall at the end of Act II. When it starts, we are pushed ahead in time to the symposium for which George has been preparing his lecture throughout the play. This is the intellectual court where his ideas are finally to be tried in opposition to the materialistic school headed by Archie Jumper, but as dreams tend to work by association rather than by strict logic, the dream symposium quickly assumes more the form of a criminal trial in a kangaroo court than a serious intellectual debate in a university philosophy department. George does not know it himself at the end of Act II (and he will never know it), but as regards Duncan McFee, the principal opponent he has all along been preparing himself to answer at the symposium, George's ethical point has already been won. For however much Duncan might have adhered intellectually to the materialist school of thought, Crouch reveals to us at the end of Act II that Duncan was not prepared to live in a real world dominated by astronaut Scott's me-first values. But Duncan has been dead since the beginning of the play, and though Archie might have killed him for his defection from the Jumpers' school of strict materialism, Stoppard's insistence that knowing the truth about reality 202</page><page sequence="17">TOM STOPPARD'S JUMPERS can be difficult made him finally leave uncertain both the motive and the perpetrator of Duncan's murder. (Indeed, Stoppard's revisions of the original text reduced the probability that Archie was the culprit.) But such an ending clouds the play's equally important concern with the primacy of moral responsibility by leaving us on the one hand with a vision of George who, counter to all his beliefs and intentions, inadvertently murders his pets while preparing a lecture on morality, and on the other with an Archie who may not be admirable and likable, but who has not yet given an unequivocal demonstration that what he represents is evil. Stoppard was evidently attracted by both the truth and the humor of showing the world as a place where the best-laid plans go astray. But he also shows an awareness that if irony is part of the human picture (pointing to the third option in the symposium's question "Man-good, bad or indifferent?"), intention and decision- making finally also have to be shown to count-otherwise the whole question of morality may be discarded as irrelevant to human behavior. That, I think, is why he insisted on keeping the Coda. For it is there that George finally experiences firsthand the real ethical problem that has all along been posed by the astronauts. And when it comes to the practical question of neck-saving, George discovers-like Captain Scott-that the truths he has taken on trust do indeed have edges that cut. George is not, as Archie finally reveals himself to be in the Coda, an active force for evil, but by failing to come to Clegthorpe's aid George becomes a passive accomplice to his murder. In the 1972 version, George fished lamely for excuses for his cowardice when Clegthorpe appealed to him: CLEGTHORPE: Professor-it's not right. George-help. CROUCH: Do you have any questions for this witness, Professor? GEORGE: Er . . . no, I don't think so. CROUCH: Thank you. (The music goes louder.) GEORGE: Well, this seems to be a political quarrel. Surely only a proper respect for absolute values . . universal truths-philosophy- (p. 85) In 1976 Stoppard rewrote this passage, adding a rueful echo of the Wittgenstein anecdote that had served to halt Dotty's attack on George's absolutes in Act II: CLEG: George, it's not right-George, help. CROUCH: Do you have any questions for this witness Professor? GEORGE: No, I don't think so. 203</page><page sequence="18">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE ARCHIE: Thank you. CLEG: George, help! GEORGE: Meeting a friend in a corridor, the Good Samaritan said: "Surely this is a political argument ... (Gunshot. CLEGTHORPE falls to the base of the pyramid, dead.) GEORGE: My very old friend-now dead, of course . . . ARCHIE: Thank you. GEORGE: Secondly . . . ARCHIE: Call Dotty Moore. Stoppard's substitution of "George" for "Professor" underscores the personal and decidedly nonacademic nature of Clegthorpe's appeal. But if that is a subtlety, the rewrite's ironic allusion to the Good Samaritan (who reminds us here just why we do not tend to confuse him with a good bacon sandwich) clearly emphasizes George's moral failure and underlines the point already obvious from George's behavior, that having moral convictions will not necessarily make one moral. The moral argument of the play breaks off with the murder of Clegthorpe. To be sure, Stoppard invites us at the end to side with George's vision of good, though the recurrence of the word "better" in George's final speech applies this time not to ethical questions but to the value of intuition with undeniable demonstrations that whatever else the fashionably skeptical might deny knowing, they all know "that life is better than death, that love is better than hate, and that the light shining through the east window of their bloody gymnasium is more beautiful than a rotting corpse!" As with the Wittgenstein anecdote, Stoppard is clearly trying to salvage George from a tight spot at the end, and judging from how often this last passage is quoted in George's favor, it would seem that he has been quite successful. If we reflect on it closely, however, George's final affirmations do not really set him off from either Archie or Captain Scott, as he does not propose any values either of them would have any difficulty accepting. (On the contrary, Scott is well aware that "life is better than death," while Archie, at least as far as Dotty goes, is all for love.) But as the argument has then suddenly switched from ethics to epistemology, the last impression we get of George is that he is in the right. George is thus resuscitated and largely rehabilitated for many people in the audience in what is Stoppard's final ambush. Neither the moral nor the epistemological questions raised by Stoppard are finally resolved in Jumpers. On the one hand, there is much that seems admirable and sympathetic and humanly comforting 204</page><page sequence="19">TOM STOPPARD'S JUMPERS about George and his stubborn conviction that, intellectual games aside, goodness is simply a fact that anyone with common sense can recognize. On the other hand, Stoppard shows that there are severe limitations to common sense and intuited knowledge; for he demonstrates that intuitions, being based on how things seem to us, may be right, but they can also be wrong (as we see, for example, when George mistakenly concludes on the basis of appearances that Dotty has murdered both Thumper and Duncan). The problem is not purely epistemological. For the difficulty of knowing, in a world where appearances do not always reveal reality, raises the problem of ethical responsibility for action, as when bad actions are unintentionally committed simply because (afflicted as we are with limited vision) we are unaware that we are committing them. Certainly Stoppard demonstrates that even the well-intentioned can inflict hurt on the very objects they meant to love and protect. But then where does that leave intention and responsibil- ity? Hence the need for a coda, tacked onto a play that was essentially finished, to demonstrate that, however much or little we may admit God to the question, there are actions a man has to choose and that he is in consequence of choice, morally responsible for them. Obviously a great deal is contradictory of all of this. Stoppard has been criticized by some for what has seemed unfinished thinking in Jumpers. Stoppard is aware of the contradictions, though, and in the 1974 Theatre Quarterly interview he insisted that this is exactly the aspect of his work that he finds valuable: I must make clear that, insofar as it's possible for me to look at my own work objectively at all, the element which I find most valuable is the one that other people are put off by-that is, that there is very often no single, clear statement in my plays. What there is, is a series of conflicting statements made by conflicting characters, and they tend to play a sort of infinite leap-frog. You know, an argument, a refutation, then a rebuttal of the refutation, then a counter-rebuttal, so that there is never any point in this intellectual leap-frog at which I feel that is the speech to stop it on, that is the last word.7 In Lord Malquist and Mr. Moon, published in 1966, the hapless Mr. Moon says much the same thing when he confesses to O'Hara that, "since all the absolutes discredit each other," he is unable to align himself with any of them: I take both parts, O'Hara, leapfrogging myself along the great moral issues, refuting myself and rebutting the refutation towards a truth that must be a compound of two opposite half-truths. And you never reach it because there is always 205</page><page sequence="20">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE something more to say. But I can't ditch it, you see O'Hara. I can't just align myself with whatever view has the approved moral tone to it.8 The problem is, in Moon's most succinct statement of it, that "I cannot commit myself to either side of a question. ... And I can't even side with the balance of morality because I don't know whether morality is an instinct or just an imposition."9 Unlike Stoppard, however, Moon is unsure whether his difficulty in locating unequivocal truths is due to his own unassertive nature or to the nature of the world around him, and he is wistfully apologetic about it all. The eight-year time span between the publication of Lord Malquist and the Theatre Quarterly interview makes clear that the belief that sooner or later "all the absolutes discredit each other" was not mere unfinished thinking on Stoppard's part, but rather the conclusion that thinking on the subject a number of times had repeatedly brought him to. Thus in Jumpers, though his sympathies obviously lie with George and what he has to say about knowledge and morality, Stoppard went out of his way (even to the point of creating artistic difficulties like that of the Coda) to demonstrate the weak spots both in George's character and in what George tells us. The various script changes and production notes help to illustrate that the contradictions and inconclusiveness were thought about and worked over a number of times but, despite objections raised behind the scenes at the National Theatre, Stoppard remained adamantly faithful to his vision that "knowing" is a tricky business and that as a result living is a messy, unstable mixture of purpose and contingency. He remained faithful, too, to an ethical vision that is neither simplistic nor reductive. George's argument that non-self-serving qualities such as "honour, pride, shame, fellow-feeling, generosity and love" are observable in human behavior is a de facto common-sense demonstra- tion that ideals and values do exist-a conviction shared by the audience which is surprisingly convalidated at the end by the behavior of George's own enemies, McFee and Clegthorpe. But the argument about instinctive values George constructs in his study finds its antithesis in the bedroom, not so much in the unprincipled behavior of Archie and his Jumpers as in the behavior of the astronauts, whose struggle for survival dramatizes an aspect of instinctive "common sense" that, despite his moral convictions, George himself finally acts upon when he ignores Clegthorpe's appeal for help. George's failure to translate his understanding of value into action when faced with personal danger does not destroy his argument that 206</page><page sequence="21">TOM STOPPARD'S JUMPERS values exist; but it does disappoint our expectations of George, and points to a realistic hole in his ethical theory that Stoppard further underscored in 1976 when he added the allusion to the Good Samaritan. The parable does not, after all, invite us to compare the Samaritan's charity with the clear evil committed by the thieves, but rather with the cowardly behavior of the priest and the Levite, men whose professional commitments to God's service did not keep them from crossing to the other side of the road when they came upon the wounded man. Like the story in Luke, Jumpers illustrates the homely truth that men who know what good is will not necessarily act on what they know. The irony and realism of the biblical lesson are, however, superseded by the Samaritan's arrival to provide a happy ending, whereas Jumpers reverses the parable's direction by holding up a vision of good which is then punctured by the realistic demonstration that, where self-interest may be compromised, goodness is easier to recognize and talk about than it is to act upon.
