<plain_text><page sequence="1">'il Disastrous Aesthetics: Irony, Ethics, and Gender in Barthelme s Snow White Jeffrey T. Nealon The observer ought to be an amorist. ?Kierkegaard (47) From the opening of Donald Barthelme's Snow White, the reader is confronted with the question of the aesthetic and its seemingly ironic relation to gender. The text begins: SHE is a tall dark beauty containing a great many beauty spots: one above the breast, one above the belly, one above the knee, one above the ankle, one above the buttock, one on the back of the neck. All of these are on the left side, more or less in a row, as you go up and down: (3) Certainly it makes all the sense in the fairy-tale world that a "beauty" like Snow White should have "beauty spots," but within this seemingly self-evident opening passage we are confronted with a series of difficult aesthetic, linguistic, and ideological questions. First, we note a grammatical slippage in the word beauty?initially used as a noun, then as an adjective. Twentieth- Century Literature 51.2 Summer 2005 123</page><page sequence="2">Jeffrey T. Nealon However, this slippage, easy enough to deal with and explain linguisti cally, leads directly to higher-order questions. Is SnowT White beautiful because of the spots?do the spots make her beautiful? Or are the spots seen as beautiful because they are attached to such a "beauty"?does she make them beautiful? Is the word spots even right here, or should it give way to the more postmodern marks? Or, conversely, is the whole question of beauty here a merely tautological one?if she's a "beauty" (whatever that may mean), then she's ipso facto got "beauty spots." If we do have a tautology, is it an enclosure out of which the novel cannot lift itself? Can aesthetics progress from this linguistic question? Can Barthelme's version of Snow White properly begin? Perhaps as compensation for the problems inherent in the word beauty, the reader is next invited to picture SnowT White's beauty through the beauty marks that rest not so coincidentally near her fetishized erog enous zones: breast, belly, knee, ankle, buttock, neck. To assist the reader in attempting to conjure up an aesthetic image of Snow White's beauty marks, there's a helpful representation provided in the text. However, this series of bullets on the left side of the page manages only to disrupt or frustrate the reader's representational desire and, in the process, links this frustrated desire to the failure of the word or category beauty?to the tautology that, let us say, opens the text or, perhaps, (fore)closes it as it attempts to begin. Unable to climb toward the light of the signified, we remain exposed to the uncertainty of the signifier. This problem concerning meaning, which dogs all of Barthelme's Snow White, seems to rob textual or aesthetic production of its traditional privilege and put it on the same level as other cultural productions. This postmodern situation, in turn, troubles traditional aesthetic thinking on at least three registers: first, it robs aesthetics of its role as arbiter of taste and value; second, it collapses the aesthetic distance that is absolutely essential for a traditional notion of aesthetic judgment;1 finally, and perhaps most cripplingly, such a leveling gesture robs aesthetics of its proper object?af ter Warhol, how to tell the difference between a disposable commodity and enduring art? But as Dan the dwarf puts it in Snow Wltite's most famous passage, there may be a way for aesthetics to continue from the point where its founding distinctions are irremediably blurred, from the point where art cannot separate itself from trash: at such a point, you will agree, the question turns from a ques tion of disposing of this "trash" to a question of appreciating its 124</page><page sequence="3">Disastrous Aesthetics: Irony Ethics, and Gender in Barthelme's Snow White qualities... .And there can no longer be any question of "dis posing" of it, because it's all there is, and we will simply have to learn how to "dig" it?that's slang, but particularly appropriate here. (97) Here we have all the ingredients for a familiar reading of aesthetics in Snow White and Barthelme's project on the whole: Barthelme, it seems, asks us to consider an ironic aesthetic stance as compensation for the ab sence of a transcendental signified; whatever we may think of trash, "we will simply have to learn how to 'dig' it." At the cultural point where the distinction between art and trash cannot hold, it is futile to try to recuper ate aesthetic categories, insofar as they too are subject to this leveling: one cannot merely dispose of trash "because it's all there is." Put in yet other terms, given the leveling or "'blanketing' effect of ordinary language" (96) that comes about in the absence of an extralinguistic reference point, no language of art can be free from infection by trash: no words or symbols can hope to be pure enough to signify univocally; the purity of the signi fied is humbled to the base level of the material signifier. To paraphrase very loosely a famous formulation from Paul de Man, trash here becomes the displaced name for a linguistic predicament.2 However, this emphasis on words as trash does not necessarily signal the failure of a postmodern aesthetic project in Snow Write; rather, on this reading, constituting an aesthetics adequate to this infected condi tion would actually be the book's (or perhaps the reader's) project. Larry McCaffery writes that "Barthelme's book attempts to create new art out of these same words and in the process it exploits the very nature of the debased condition into which language and story-telling have fallen" (31). Here, both Barthelme and the reader, in taking up what Peter Nicholls summarizes as "the ironic perspective that offers the only way of seeing the world afresh" (15), would be able to salvage a kind of new aesthetic experience, "to create new art" out of the junkpile of the text. And even if the text really does turn out to be garbage, at least the reader would have the solace of being among the few to realize that fact; with any luck at all, the reader as ironist can join Barthelme "at the leading edge of this trash phenomenon" (Snow White 97-98). There remains, however, a problem here. Given this reading, Snow White is involved not in a radical or postmodern project at all but is rather reproducing the founding, ancient ideas of aesthetics and its helping-hand relation to knowledge. The project of reconstructing or reawakening 125</page><page sequence="4">Jeffrey T. Nealon aesthetic experience does not seem adequately to question the increas ingly suspicious category of "experience" and its difficult relation to either aesthetics or knowledge. In other words, if the aim of the project is reawakening a sense of aesthetic wonder?in Barthelme's words, "restor ing freshness to a much-handled language" ("Not-Knowing" 513)?this seems to bring us back to the relationship between aesthetics and knowl edge first formulated by Aristotle. Recall the Metaphysics: it is because of wondering that men began to philosophize and do so now.... Now a man who is perplexed and wonders con siders himself ignorant (whence a lover of myth, too, is in a sense a philosopher, for a myth is composed of wonders), so if indeed they philosophized to avoid ignorance, it is evident that they pursued science in order to understand. (982b). For Aristotle, the philosopher first "is perplexed and wonders," and in turn seeks out knowledge "to avoid ignorance." Hence we see how "a lover of myth, too, is in a sense a philosopher": both the lover of myth and the philosopher crave the new knowledge that is foreshadowed in their sense of wonder; they both crave to understand the awe-inspiring. In the reading of Snow White sketched out above, then, Barthelme's text would be engaged in something like such an Aristotelian project. It would be an attempt to offer the reader a new sense of wonder or awe, an attempt to displace the readers too-cozy categories of knowledge and restore the desire to know. To the extent that there is a displacement of Aristotle in Barthelme, however, Barthelme would want to question the second of Aristotle's movements?the movement wherein a quasi-aesthetic and originary "wonder" is reduced to the doinain of "science" or "understanding." For Barthelme the postmodern, it seems that the wonder of the desire to know does not and should not reduce simply to knowledge: in the age of technology, such a movement has shown itself as the movement of exclusion and violence just as surely as it is the movement of progress. So Barthelme, contra Aristotle, would want to preserve wonder's proper ontological status:3 the "wonder" of myth is not something to be offered up to knowledge but is rather the tropological ground that makes all un derstanding problematic. As Nicholls puts it, in the context of a reading of Barthelme's "Kierkegaard Unfair to Schlegel," for Barthelme the moment of understanding as "'reconciliation' offers no way of defamiliarizing the 126</page><page sequence="5">Disastrous Aesthetics: irony, Ethics, and Gender in Barthelme's Snow White world for perception" (13). Barthelme's project, then, could be?and has been?called a radically ironic one: an attempt to preserve the wonder of ironic dissimulation.4 Here Barthelme's irony seems to be an attempt to reenchant an otherwise wholly disenchanted world?an attempt to restore wonder to the reader and, in the process, to question the priority of abstract or unitary knowledge. However, there clearly is a knowledge produced by the ironic text, no matter how radical its irony. The reader of Snow White does not take away a singular moral or plot line, but he or she does take away a revelation: the revelation that the ironic perspective is the one best suited to the contem porary situation. The reader of Snow White comes to a realization much like Luk?cs's in The Theory of the Novel: "Irony, the self-surmounting of a subjec tivity that has gone as far as it is possible to go, is the highest form that can be achieved in a world without God" (93). As Luk?cs suggests, in an ironic questioning of a world no longer transcendental, a new "highest form" of knowledge is nonetheless produced: the knowledge that there is no stable knowledge. While this was perhaps a crippling revelation at some point in history, anyone who has taught freshman composition lately has seen the nonchalant?dare I say totalizing?acceptance of this type of thinking. In the short space of 20 years or so, ironic undecidability has morphed from an avant-gardist stance into a T-shirt slogan: "Whatever ..." Likewise, in this attempt to reawaken aesthetic experience through irony, the historical and philosophical project of aesthetics does not seem to be sufficiently questioned; the terms of an aesthetics based on some thing like wonder go unexamined. And this, perhaps, goes a long way toward explaining why the ironic revelation is not a more disruptive one. Rather than questioning a traditional aesthetics and the metaphysics that subtends it, the ironic project plays to a receptive audience of metaphysi cians: irony preserves the moment of wonder rethematized as a type of consumption based in both knowledge and pleasure; it preserves the privi lege of the subject as the locus of the text's revelation; it reestablishes a no tion of aesthetic distance or aesthetic depth, necessary to decide whether or not a phenomenon is ironic; and, perhaps most problematically, such an irony reinstalls the sight that is the ground of aesthetics. Snow Wliite's opening may cause us to confront the failure of aesthetics as seeing, but armed with the ironist's knowledge, the reader learns by or at book's end to see, appreciate, and wonder again. Something like aesthetic distance or depth is regained through the ironic revelation. 127</page><page sequence="6">Jeffrey T. Nealon The aesthetic gaze in Snow W?tite Of course, the traditional artistic gaze of wonder is subject to a thorough going critique in Snow White?a critique based on the violence of the masculinist appropriative gaze that masquerades as mere appreciation. For example, Hogo, archpig of the text, relates to the dwarfs "a fewT vile things, more or less at random" about Snow White: this cunt you've got here, although I've never seen her with my own eyes, is probably not worth worrying about. Now excuse me if I'm treading on your toes in this matter. God knows I love a female gesture as much as any man, as when, for instance, sit ting in the front seat of a car in their bikini, they kind of shrug themselves into a street shift before getting out, or while the car door is open but they haven't gotten out yet; and if you happen to be looking out of the window of a house near the curb, or if you can move your windowr nearer the curb, you can sometimes see one sitting in her absolute underwear, in the hot weather, and then going through that "shrugging" business, and sort of hitching the shift up over her hips, and then shaking her head to get the hair to fall the right way, and all that. And all this is the best that has been thought and said, in my opinion, or ever will be thought and said, for the only thing worth a rap in the whole world is the beauty of women. (73) Here Hogo rather crudely reveals the sexist gaze that underlies the seem ingly objectivist and disinterested project of aesthetic appreciation: "the best that has been thought and said" is shown here to be determined by criteria of beauty that are thoroughly misogynist; the aesthete's project extends the wolf whistling of a construction worker. From the opening diagram of Snow White's body through the dwarfs' ogling "a river of girls and women" (15) to the observation bunker that Paul uses to "keep [Snow White] under constant surveillance" (156), the figure of woman, as the aesthetic object par excellence, is shown in Snow White to be always subject to as well as subject of representation. And while the dwarfs feel that "esthetics [is] the least ballsy of the several areas of inquiry subsumed under the term, philosophical thought" (123), it is clear that in Snow White the subsuming gaze of aesthetic truth is every bit as "ballsy"?thoroughly male-dominated?as the more scien tistic brands of philosophical inquiry that the dwarfs prefer. For example, 128</page><page sequence="7">Disastrous Aesthetics: Irony, Ethics, and Gender in Barthelme's Snow White as Snow White loses sexual interest in the dwarfs' showTer-room frolics, Dan offers a possible aesthetic solution: Now, what do we apprehend when we apprehend Snow White? We apprehend, first, two three-quarter-scale breasts floating toward us wrapped, typically, in a red towel. Or, if we are appre hending her from the other direction, we apprehend a beautiful snow-white arse floating away from us wrapped in a red towel. What, in these two distinct apprehensions, remains the same? Why, quite simply, the red towel. I submit that, rightly under stood, the problem of Snow White has to do at its center with nothing else but red towels. . . . We can easily dispense with the slippery and untrustworthy and expensive effluvia that is Snow White, and cleave instead to the towel. (100-01) Dan here reinforces the links between aesthetic "apprehending" and the violence of the appropriative gaze: to the dwarfs, Snow White is noth ing more than a collection of fetishized zones?breasts or bottoms?on display for their aesthetic and erotic pleasure. Like Paul, the dwarfs have "NEVER BEFORE REALLY SEEN SNOW WHITE AS A WOMAN" (150), and try to bypass her increasing unhappiness merely by displacing their gaze onto the red towel; in doing so, as Cristina Bacchilega writes, the dwarfs juxtapose "one fetish to another [thereby] underscoring the reified nature of Snow White" (14). But finding a new object for their gaze does not change its nature, and, as fellow dwarf Chang makes per fectly clear, the red towel will not offer the appropriation of the feminine that they crave: "I don't want a ratty old red towel. I want the beautiful snow-white arse itself' (101). But if Snow White is the story of the well-deserved decentering or failure of a dangerously misogynist concept of aesthetic beauty?as the final page phrases it, "THE FAILURE OF SNOW WHITE'S ARSE" (181)?the book nevertheless reinscribes an ironic aesthetics that saves not an ars po?tica but what we could perhaps call an arse po?tica: an ironic and deflating poetics characterized by an appreciation for the necessary failure of all totalizing ordering principles. As I argue above, on such a reading Snow White's project would be restore wonder.5 But, as I likewise intimate, such a movement seems to resubmit the text to the predicament that it wishes to question: if it is a matter of restoring wonder to its proper pri ority, one never leaves the subjective orbit of the appropriating aesthetic 129</page><page sequence="8">Jeffrey T. Nealon sight metaphors that are themselves the problem. When Snow White sees the temporal disruption of her poem as "A metaphor of the self armoring itself against the gaze of the Other" (59)?an attempt to forestall any of the dwarfs' violent appropriations of her body and her experience?this might seem logical enough, and certainly a worthwhile project, but it also seems doomed to fail, insofar as the subject's "armoring itself against the gaze of the Other" is a continuation both of the sight metaphor and the war of subject against subject that seems to be in question: a certain psy choanalysis would see the dwarfs' girl watching and Hogo s sexist tirades as themselves an armoring against the Other. There is, of course, much to be said for the reversal of a violent hi erarchy?it is perhaps necessary if any hierarchy is to be disrupted. By itself, however, such a strategy leaves hierarchical logic itself untouched. In reversing hierarchy's poles or merely shielding oneself from its effects, one continues to play by its inexorable logic?or, more precisely, one contin ues as if this logic were inexorable; one fails to intervene in this violent project, and in fact assists it. Certainly, if we return to a consideration of the ironic, this failure is not a problem?it is, in fact, a further example of the irony of it all: aesthetics, like everything else in the postmodern world, is shot through with reversals and paradoxes, and at best we can come to a bemused appreciation ofthat fact. This ironic epiphany, then, is the postmodern rescue of the ontological moment of wonder from its subordination to knowledge. As any ironist knows, this impossible pos sibility is an opportunity for new insight. It's hardly a disaster. Disastrous aesthetics Perhaps, though, disaster is the perfect word for this predicament. As a combination of the Latin pejorative dis- and the Greek root astron, disaster names a state of worsening fortune: literally cut off from the stars and the wonder-laden promise of perfection and union that the stars have repre sented in Western thinking since the time of the Greeks.6 Plato's Timaeus works out the links between sight, aesthetics, and knowledge as follows: God invented and gave us sight to the end that we might behold the courses of intelligence in the heavens, and apply them to the courses of our own intelligence which are akin to them, the unperturbed to the perturbed. (47b)7 130</page><page sequence="9">Disastrous Aesthetics: irony, Ethics, and Gender in Barthelme's Snow White Sight, the privileged access to knowledge, allows us to aestheticize the heavens, to wonder at their perfection and thus to access our own im perfect situation. Indeed, the "unperturbed" fixed star in Greek thinking represents the limit that both drives thinking and holds it back: the perfec tion of the far-away star, perhaps hopeless to strive for, nevertheless gives rise to the desire to know. The philosopher looks to the twinkling stars, across the great distances, and wonders. For Aristotle, the stars' twinkling is not an indication of their imperfection but is rather an effect of our limitations: our sight, when used at long range, becomes weak and unsteady. This is possibly the reason also why the fixed stars appear to twinkle but the planets do not.The planets are near, so that our vision reaches them with its powers unimpaired, but in reach ing the fixed stars it is extended too far, and causes our vision to waver. (On the Heavens 290a) We can see only so far, and, as a consequence, we can know only so much. Past that limit, there is wonder?a wonder that drives, preserves, and regulates knowledge. It seems, though, that the disaster, as the starless withdrawal of the horizon of the star, would force us to abandon the notion of knowledge as aesthetics, to abandon as a ground the wondrous sight that always falls short of reaching the far-away star. As Maurice Blanchot writes, If disaster (d?sastre) means being separated from the star (if it means the decline which characterizes disorientation when the link with fortune from on high is cut), then it indicates a fall beneath disastrous necessity (Disaster 2) Being cut off from the star means being cut off from a metaphoric or hypotactic necessity, cut off from the ability to metaphorize?and thereby aestheticize and judge?our world in terms of the far-away star's perfection. The disaster, in other words, names the "necessity" of chance, parataxis, metonymy. However, this separation from the horizon of the star (this inexorable flattening at the aesthetic heart of knowledge) would seem to separate us at the same time from any ironic recuperation: the revelation of ironic paradox, the wondrous knowledge that our sight will never reach the fixed stars, does not seem adequate to the disastrous necessity named in this situation. To recuperate the power of sight?to 131</page><page sequence="10">Jeffrey T. Nealon see seeing or to see the limit of seeing?only keeps the disaster at bay; it allows us again to locate the origin of knowledge within our paradoxi cal horizon?both within ourselves (the essential need for knowledge) and far away (the impossible purity of the fixed star that could fill such a need). The disaster forces us to question the economy of soul and cosmos that grounds such knowledge. As Blanchot notes, the necessity of the disaster forces us to recognize what is left out of such a closed economy. He asks, Is the cosmic thus the temptation to melt into the fiction of the universe, and thereby become indifferent to the tormenting vi cissitudes of the near at hand (the neighboring)? Would the cos mic be a little heaven in which to survive, or with which to die universally, in stoic serenity? A "whole" which shelters us, even as we dissolve therein ... ? (Disaster 75) For Blanchot, emphasis on the "cosmic"?even an entropie, devolving, or paradoxical cosmos?inexorably shelters us from the disaster; it allows us to project or protect a realm not subject to the disaster, or to make ironic paradox itself the locus or theme of knowledge. Irony, in other words, reinvents the cosmic distance of the far-away star as it becomes the new metaphor for knowledge. In the process, there is a sheltering from the disaster.8 If the disaster reveals anything?and this remains uncertain?it is a seemingly minuscule change in orientation. No longer can the foundation of knowledge work on the models of aesthetics (beginning in and return ing to the vision of man, as in Plato's and Aristotle's contemplation of the fixed star).Through the narrative of anthropos contemplating the fixed star in order to access its own situation, we see the foundational moment of knowledge played out as a version of the Western urnarrative, the Odyssey: an "adventure" that can and must return home; a movement outside the self that begins only in and through the knowledge of a richer return for the hero. As Jill Robbins writes, it could be argued that the Odyssean itinerary is also not a plot in the derived sense: it is the fundamental plot of Western phi losophy, the plot in which one will never have to encounter the other ... this would-be adventure that is in fact a spurious alter 132</page><page sequence="11">Disastrous Aesthetics: irony, Ethics, and Gender in Barthelme's Snow White ity a false outside, the insistence on adequation, the refusal of ex teriority that is the very figure of philosophical thought. (108)9 Over against an Odyssean economy of assured returns, where the in dividual is the beginning and end of every sortie for knowledge, there would be the disaster: a departure without return. Rather than depending on the circular, protected economy of the individual, knowledge as or of the disaster owes itself to a founding disruption?the necessity of ac counting for the debt that I owe before I look, before I think. Of course, such a founding debt makes any kind of pure, strictly anthropomorphic I impossible, insofar as such a grounding I would have to found its own context rather than being subject to something outside itself and its ocular horizon. If knowledge has been dependent on sight?theorein, aletheia, ad equation?it then depends on a relation between a primary same and a secondary other, or in the modern period, between a subject and an object. As I argue above, the project of ironic knowledge?Barthelme's project?would hope to restore the wondrous unthematizable primacy of the other, to return wonder to the formerly denigrated object of knowl edge.10 It would seem, then, that the project of disastrous knowledge is merely another version of the project of ironic aesthetics?a project that attempts to restore the sublimity of the other. However, according to Blanchot, the disaster involves more than the unthematizability of the other; certainly the privileging of the stars in Western thought assumed they were other: unthematizable, distant, and?at least in fantasy?prima ry. Even as it jettisons a unitary or totalizing focus, ironic knowledge still preserves the primacy of the same; such a project protects this economy by reifying the circular movement of knowledge?from self to other back to self?and thereby surreptitiously reintroduces the reduction and preservation of truth. As Blanchot summarizes this project, "In the rela tion of myself to the Other, the Other exceeds my grasp" (Disaster 19), but "myself" remains the locus of ironic revelation?the privileged horizon, the measure of all things. "But," Blanchot continues, in the relation of the Other to me, everything seems to reverse itself: the distant becomes the close by, this proximity becomes the obsession that afflicts me, that weighs down upon me, that separates me from myself. (Disaster 19) 133</page><page sequence="12">Jeffrey T. Nealon Here we reach a point of some obscurity In the approach of "the Other to me," the disaster is no longer a theme for knowledge, a metaphor that would allow the subject to bridge an aesthetic distance; it is, rather, that which names the proximity of the neighboring?the m?tonymie chain of substitutions that disrupts the subject's privilege and "separates me from myself." Keeping in mind Blanchot's caveat that "we know the disaster by other, perhaps more joyful names" (6), one could say, perhaps, that ap proach of the other is the disaster. The approach of the other brings about the exteriorizing of the self without any possibility of returning to itself whole; the disaster?as the other?names the necessity of accounting for a constitutive excess or remainder that is outside the subject's horizon and control. Crucially, however, for Blanchot the disaster does more than merely spoil, more than merely frustrate the horizon of the self, leaving it be reft and without knowledge. Indeed, the necessity of carrying on and responding to the disaster is just as important as a recognition of this disastrous difficulty; thinking and action are not merely stifled by the disaster?their urgency is, if fact, heightened. As Paul Davies writes about Blanchot's disaster, "in being ruined as a totalizing discourse, philosophy continues in and as a responding discourse." (213) Thinking and action do not end with the disaster, but they take on a different structure?not a mere stopping but a (icontinuing as response. " Of course, in any particular subjective now, the event that is alterity or the disaster has happened al ready: there are already others when I come into being. I am always after the starless horizon that is the other, called then to respond to it.11 On this point it is tempting to understand Blanchot's disaster as a "vulgar" reading of Levinas's work on alterity?to understand Blanchot's text as a restatement of the metaphysical primacy of the other, and the concomitant necessity7 to respect strangers, widows, and orphans.12 But, under a disastrous necessity, the point is not that the individual is bereft of his or her privilege in the face of the other person or a wholly other godlike entity that is primary. Rather, the point here concerning Blanchot is a bit simpler: in the starless horizon of the disaster, knowledge is not synonymous with appropriation as sight; it does not begin and end in the horizon of our faculties. Knowledge, thinking, ethics, and aesthetics are, rather, a matter of responding to the disaster, responding to something that strips us of privilege and possibility. One might be tempted to call this disaster god, if one understood god as anything other than an anthropomorphic 134</page><page sequence="13">Disastrous Aesthetics: Irony, Ethics, and Gender in Barthelme's Snow White projection that offers concrete conditions of possibility, the Greek "fixed star" only slightly reinscribed in later Western thinking. One might be able to rename the disaster as god, that is, if god?including the god of nega tive theology?were understood as something other than a philosophical marker to keep the disaster at bay.13 Unlike the god of negative theology, the disaster is not a negative foundation or the withdrawal of a former wholeness. It is, rather, the (non)founding "event" that calls for a radically exteriorizing response. Admittedly, the dominant Western response to the disaster or the other has been one of recuperation and/as mourning for a supposed loss of self?and irony is a continuation of that very recuperation. But insofar as it pretends that the disaster has not taken place, this nostalgic response is clearly inadequate. The disaster calls for response without models, without maps, without the possibility of regaining a privileged subjective control. And such an emphasis on response is likewise inscribed in Snow White's concluding pages, where we read the striking statement: "ANATHEMATIZATION OF THE WORLD IS NOT AN AD EQUATE RESPONSE" (178). Although there is an understandable frustration in negotiating a world without concrete foundations, swearing off or swearing at this world is not an adequate response to it. But the question of what an "ADEQUATE RESPONSE" is in the postmodern world (or to Snow l?mite) remains radically unclear within the text?and perhaps this is the book's crowning ironic moment. The reader of Snow White is left in the throes of this radical irony. A certain negative assurance (characteristic of ironic knowledge) is the only thing secured by the text: one can't merely anathematize the world, as much as one might like to. The world?as well as the text?is shot through with this ironic revela tion. "Anathematization" can be read, without too much violence, as a word concerning thinking or thematization: it may be that "ana-the matization" is being highlighted as an inadequate response to the world. But this offers little help, insofar as the prefix ana- has myriad conflicting meanings: it can mean "upward progression" (as in anabolic or analeptic), but it can also mean "reversion" (as in anaplasia); it can mean "backward" (as in anachronism or anamnesis), but it can also mean "intensification" (as in anaphylaxis). So whether one thematizes forward, upward, backward, or more intensely, it remains inadequate to the world. On an ironic reading 135</page><page sequence="14">Jeffrey T. Nealon of Barthelme's text, this inadequacy inheres because no thematization of the world is or can be adequate to its peculiarities and wonders. One is, at Snow White's end, left to appreciate the ironic fact that any thematization falls short of capturing the wonder of objects. The potentially positive aspects of such a seemingly negative ironic project are neatly summed up by Martha Nussbaum, who, in discussing James's The Ambassadors in the context of Aristotle's statement "discrimina tion lies in perception" (182), suggests that "general and universal formula tions may be inadequate to the complexity of particular situations_We want to suggest that bewilderment and hesitation may actually be marks of fine attention" (182). For Nussbaum, as for the ironist Barthelme, such a "fine attention" in the absence of "universal formulations" is the ethical gift that literature offers to a world obsessed with inadequate transcen dental thematizations: stories cultivate our ability to see and care for particulars, not as representatives of a law, but as what they themselves are: to re spond vigorously with senses and emotions before the new; to care deeply about chance happenings in the world, rather than fortify ourselves against them-[T]he novel acknowledges a wonder before worldly sensuous particulars. (184)14 While this project may share certain aspects of Blanchot's?response, singularity, a suspicion of "universal formulations"?Nussbaum's remains a theory that retains the Odyssean circular reappropriation of subjectiv ity as the locus of reading and knowledge. For Blanchot, something like Nussbaum's fine attention to textual detail?an attention that should lead us "to care deeply about chance happenings in the world, rather than fortify ourselves against them"?remains "still a relation to the star_We are not called outside ourselves by care's obsession, but detained within the region that's secure, even as we make our way to abandon" (Disaster 50). In other words, Nussbaum's relation to the text is akin to Blanchot's relation of "myself to other": the destination remains personal, and read ing remains an Odyssean activity. As the self cannibalizes the knowledge of its own fine attention, the emphasis remains on the subjectivity of epiphany rather than the alterity of response. In fact, it is precisely such an ironic subjective reflexivity that, for Blanchot, keeps the subject safe from exteriority?safe from the disastrous knowledge that "it is through the other that I am the same" (18). 136</page><page sequence="15">Disastrous Aesthetics: Irony, Ethics, and Gender in Barthelme's Snow White Our steady stream of disasters in the news?hurricanes, floods, tsu namis, earthquakes?certainly has spawned some irony (recall President Bush's "You're doing a heck of a job, Brownie" during the Hurricane Ka trina debacle of 2005), but that irony remains inadequate if it's understood as a kind of interior subjective epiphany or a form of personal knowledge, Nussbaum's "fine attention." While textual events cannot simply be con flated with real-world ones, the radical alterity of a disaster of either kind, however it might be mediated, is hardly treated adequately if I respond to it solely as an opportunity for me to gain greater knowledge about myself or the world. Shakespeare's The Tempest is no more about me than hurricanes are. The two events would of course call on me to respond in radically different ways, but for Blanchot it is the power of the call to respond?rather than the cannibalizing ofthat power into a new form of subjective ironic knowledge?that characterizes the disaster. Irony, in the end, is more about protecting me than it is about responding to you, as Barthelme helpfully reminds us: irony is originally, at base, a defense. Then what one has to ask is: a defense against what? I think it is a defense against nonsensi cal impositions by other people who force themselves into your life.... There is no defense against the Internal Revenue Service except irony, and that is not much of a defense. It's like trying to use irony against the telephone company. It doesn't register with them.... [T]he first problem of wit is that it requires a witty audience. If you have an audience of sheep, wit is an ineffective weapon. (Interview 47). In the end, however, Barthelme's Snow White finally gives in to the ironic insight that the text constantly runs up against: "what is, is insuffi cient" (135).This revision of Alexander Pope's famous dictum is, perhaps, the most concise version of Barthelme's irony. In surrendering to it, in avoiding the disaster and hazard of response as reinscription, Barthelme protects a kind of aesthetic conservatism and a thoroughgoing subjective privilege that radical modes of postmodern writing, as well as radical ethical criticism, claim to have left in the dust. 137</page><page sequence="16">Jeffrey T. Nealon Notes 1. Perhaps Horace's 'Art of Poetry" most concisely sums up this ideal of aes thetic distance:'As with the painter's work, so with the poet's; one piece will take you more if you stand close to it, another at a great distance" (73). 2.While it would be visiting undue violence on both texts, one is tempted here to read Barthelme's linguistic trash phenomenon as a version of Der ridean difi?rame?the simultaneous deferring and differing that returns always to the waste product that should be disposed of in the work of meaning: the signifier. Recall in this context Dan: the quality this stuffing has, that the other parts of verbality do not have, is two-parted, perhaps: (1) an "endless" quality and (2) a "sludge" quality. Of course that is possibly two qualities but I prefer to think of them as different aspects of a single quality. (96) 3. See Covino's The Art of Wondering for just such a revisionary reading of Aris totle. 4. See Wilde's Horizons of Assent, especially the final section "Barthelme Unfair to Kierkegaard," where he argues for a development of irony in Barthelme's work from a modernist irony of suspensive impasse to a postmodern generative irony of "assent": as his career develops, "Barthelme's irony becomes ... some thing more, or less, than suspensive?or, more accurately, becomes suspensive in a richer, more complex way" (176). For Barthelme's own comments on the place of irony in his work, see "Kierkegaard Unfair to Schlegel" and his inter view in The Radical Imagination and the Liberal Tradition. 5. See Bacchilega, who argues that Snow White increasingly comes to see her own subordinated position within the dominant male aesthetics and at tempts?for example, in her poem?to construct something marvelous for herself: "Marvelous"?the word Snow White uses to describe something as mysterious and yet visibly ordinary as the wTater falling on her back? derives etymologically from mirabilis and suggests both "wonder at" (miran) and "visible" (the mir root indicates "to see"). What is "marvel ous" arouses the imagination to wonder/wander, to speculate curious ly.... In the flow of water, Snow White finds the same kind of freedom and pleasure she found in her own free-flowing poem. (15) 6. See Plato's Timaeus 30a?48 and Aristotle's On the Heavens book 2, chs. 7?10. 138</page><page sequence="17">Disastrous Aesthetics: irony, Ethics, and Gender in Barthelme's Snow White 7. Compare Aristotle's Metaphysics: All men by nature desire understanding. A sign of this is their liking of sensations; for even apart from the need of these for other things, they are liked for their own sake, and of all sensations those received by means of the eyes are liked most ... seeing makes us know in the high est degree, and makes clear many differences in things. (980a) 8.This, I would argue, is precisely the problem with de Man's work on irony as permanent parabasis; in de Man's hands, such an ironic impasse becomes the systematic truth (reread as permanent disruption) that philosophy aspires to: "Irony is no longer a trope but the systematic undoing of the deconstructive allegory of all tropological conditions, the systematic undoing, in other wTords, of understanding" (301 ). 9. For more on this topic, see Adorno and Horkheimer's Dialectic of Enlighten ment, Blanchot's "The Song of the Sirens," Kafka's "The Silence of the Sirens," and Levinas's opposing the story of Abraham to the story of Odysseus in Oth erwise Than Being. 10. This is perhaps the idea that reconnects Barthelme and Kierkegaard on the question of irony: both want to bring a certain humility to the imperial philo sophical gesture.They disagree, however, about whether irony can do the job: for Kierkegaard, irony is this philosophical gesture writ large; for Barthelme, irony is the corrective to such an imperialism. Note, however, that in attempt ing to restore a certain aesthetic wonder to the object, both code the won drous object as feminine. See the opening of Barthelme's story "Kierkegaard Unfair to Schlegel," which he later describes as a male heterosexual "masturba tion fantasy" (Interview 46). 11. See Smock. 12. See Levinas's Totality and Infinity (251 ff.). 13. On this point, see Derrida's "Of an Apocalyptic Tone" and "How to Avoid Speaking: Denials" in Coward and Foshay 25-72 and 73?142. 14. Compare Wilde s final pages on generative irony and humanism: Barthelme remains part of the world he perceives, approaching it through a process of interrogation to which he opens himself as well.... In the final analysis, the [ironic] alternative presents itself, however malapropos or offensive the word sounds to many today, as a humanism of sorts ... an active presence forging, tentatively, a morality, an ideal at any rate, and an irony for postmodern (or, possibly, post postmodern?) man.
