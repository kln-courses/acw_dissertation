<plain_text><page sequence="1">SYMBOL AND SINCERITY IN ISLAM Modern scholars have sometimes noted that attitudes towards the nature of truth and the extent to which truth is to be disseminated among society at large were very different in medieval Islamic society from what they are in the Modern West. Medieval Muslim thinkers of various schools, both orthodox and heterodox, tended to think that society was inevitably divided into an elite which was capable of understan- ding the full truth and a majority of persons who were not capable of such understanding, and for whom education in the ways of truth might be more harmful than helpful. Intellec- tuals or religious sectarians with such assumptions did not show any compunctions about representing themselves in public as believing something other than what they truly believed, since publication of their true beliefs would confuse the masses, and, if the beliefs were heterodox, might also be a cause of persecution. The work which modern scholars have done on notions of esoterism, dissimulation, and pious fabrication in traditional Islamic culture does not seem to have had an adequate impact on studies of modern Islamic intellectual history. The fact that modern Muslim intellectuals emerged from a culture in which such notions were dominant, and in several cases, such as Sayyid Jamal ad-Din al-Afgh5ni, Muhammad Abduh, and Muhammad Iqbal, had a traditional mystic and philosophical background which particularly stressed speaking differently to the initiated and to the masses, should lead one to suspect that their published works did not necessarily represent their inner beliefs. An examination of the works of such intellectuals which took into account the esoteric and elitist assumptions</page><page sequence="2">of much of traditional Islamic writing might reach rather different conclusions than an analysis which takes the words of each author at face value. For example, personal study of the Iranian constitutional revolution of 1905-1911 has indicated that some of the modernist preachers, who taught that modern constitutional ideas were to be found in the Qur'an, were themselves irreligious; and that the actual views of Sayyid Jamal ad-Din al-Afghani were probably quite different from those expressed in the Refutation of the Materialists (1). The public utterances of these men were framed in such a way as to be influential in a situation of widespread fanaticism. In the Middle East, with its elitist traditions and its continuing wide gap between the upper and lower classes in way of life, education, and belief, one still frequently encounters the notion among intellectuals that religion, even of the most literalist and traditional variety, is a good thing to keep the masses moral, even though it may be inaccurate. And Middle Eastern intellectuals are generally quite aware that there may be a difference between a man's public utterances and his private beliefs. Such differences exist also in the West, particularly in the sphere of politics, but in the Middle East they are far more pervasive in the spheres of philosophy and religion than they are in the modern West. The frequency of a distinction between what is said and what is believed is due not only to the gap between the elite and masses or the persistent power of the traditionalists to keep radical ideas about religion from being freely expressed, but seems also to arise from the influence of centuries-long traditions of esoterism, double meanings, and precautionary dissimulation. This paper will attempt, largely on the basis of others' research, to analyze and to summarize some of these traditions, which have hitherto been noted mostly as single aspects of studies on other subjects. Awareness of the predominance of such traditions in Islamic culture suggests that the writings of modern Muslim intellectuals should perhaps (1) For a summary statement on these points see my ( Religion and Irreligion in Early Iranian Nationalism ), Comparative Studies in Society and History, IV, 3 (April, 1962), especially pp. 275-289. 28 NIKKI R. KEDDIE</page><page sequence="3">SYMBOL AND SINCERITY IN ISLAM be approached with methods similar to those used by scholars to distinguish those words of the Muslim philosophers which represent their true beliefs from those written for prudential reasons (1). Dissimulation of one's true beliefs, esoteric interpretations of scripture, and fabrication of supposedly traditional religious material are found in Christian, Jewish, and other traditional cultures as well as in Islam. The Western world, however, has undergone centuries of evolution away from traditional medieval patterns, so that we no longer find men expressing themselves according to medieval norms and presuppositions, while the Islamic world has been suddenly thrust from a medieval to a modern situation, and some traditional suppositions and modes of expression are often latent in the most modernized Middle Easterner. Also, it may be that tendencies to avoid literal accuracy and to assume a difference between the appearance of things and their reality have been stronger in Islam than in other traditional cultures. Certain general reasons for the pervasiveness of dissimulation, esoterism, and fabrication in Islam may be suggested: 1) The Qur'an, to the Muslim, is the exact and unalterable word of God. Its position in traditional Islam is far higher than that of the Bible in traditional Christianity, and because of its divine character its role has recently been compared rather to that of Christ in Christianity (2). Belief in the divine character of the Qur'an became, through a consensus which played the role of the more formal doctrinal Christian authorities, a prerequisite for whoever would claim membership in the Muslim community. This meant that innovations in theory and practice had to be shown to be compatible with the Qur'an, or, even better, actually enjoined by a true understanding of the Qur'an. (1) On this distinction see, among others, Leo Strauss, Persecution and the Art of Writing (Glencoe, 111., 1952), George F. Ilourani's introduction and notes to his translation of Averroes' On the Harmony of Religion and Philosophy (Kildb fasl al-maqal) (London, 1961), and Muhsin Mahdi, Ibn' Khaldtn's Philosophy of History (London, 1957), ch.

KEDDIE Since the Qur'an shows all the signs of its origins in a particular oasis commurlity, but had to meet the needs of very different and internally evolving societies, the work of interpretation and reading things into the Qur'in, from tl-he beginning until now, seems to an outsider to have been forced, both in its methods and results. Yet there really was no alternative. Some of the medieval and modern Qur'an interpreters may have been aware of the intellectually dubious character of their exegeses, but they could not declare the Qur'an irrelevant to the problems they were considering if they wanted to be treated as part of the community. In the earliest period of Islam there seem to have been many Muslims who paid little attention to the Qur'an, and under the early 'Abbasids men of the Shu'iibiya, representing the bureaucrats as against the religious scholars, sometimes criticized or even ridiculed the Qur'an, but the gradual tightening of orthodoxy discouraged such currents. A style thus became fixed of quoting Qur'anic passages in order to prove the legitimacy of any argument, and of stretching the possible meaning of such passages to the utmost limits. Thus it might seem that modernists who try to find Qur'anic sanction for everything from parliaments and constitutions to evolution and germ theory (Kaawakibi's Tabd'i' al-Islibddd, for example, has all this and more) are simply following a traditional and long unavoidable style. It is only in the most recent times that we find, besides widespread intellectual indifference to Islam except when it serves political or nationalist purposes, a beginning of Muslim historical criticism of the Qur'an, and this is still a weak trend (1). 2) The rapid conquest by the Muslim Arabs of huge numbers of people with higher cultural traditions and more developed administrative and economic practices meant that many foreign customs had to be assimilated into Islam but, in order to maintain Islam as the focus of loyalty, such borrowings had to be denied. Islam provided the early Arab conquerors with the legal rules of the Qur'an and certain practices of the Prophet (1) The beginnings of Muslim historical criticism of the Qur'an are discussed in J. M. S. Baljon, Modern Muslim Koran Inlerprelalion (1880-1960) (Leiden, 1961). 30</page><page sequence="5">SYMBOL AND SINCERITY IN ISLAM as guides, but these were far from being adequate to meet the new administrative problems. For a while there was a rather ( secular ) ad hoc treatment of new administrative and judicial problems, but, as shall be noted, there was a strong Islamic reaction against this. The community made felt its preference for ascribing to Muhammad and his companions, if not to God himself, the necessary legal and administrative innovations. Similarly, in the realm of ideas, both sophisticated notions from Greek philosophy and popular religious beliefs were gradually Islamicized. The early Arab Muslims were flexible and ready to borrow from non-Muslims what was needed to adapt to conditions outside Arabia, but they became increasingly unwilling to admit borrowing. With the usual reluctance of traditional societies to admit change and the desire of the pious to present Islam as having been perfect from the beginning, there was a natural propensity to write the history of the earliest Islamic periods as if all the later practices had already existed then, at least in embryo. Other religions have experien- ce? similar things, but what is perhaps special in Islam was the need for extremely rapid assimilation of and adaptation to a very different society. Somewhat special too is the particular form which Islamization took, which was usually, as shall be seen, the attribution to Muhammad of a saying justifying each practice. The compulsion to give Islamic ancestry, through ascription to Muhammad, to a vast range of foreign ideas and practices meant that in the Islamic community other values stood higher than the value of literal accuracy. 3) In Islamic history there has been a peculiar combination of a wide range of intellectual and religious speculation with an increasing demand for at least formal orthodoxy, until very recently. Hellenistic influences and the rapid development of social and economic life encouraged philosophic and scientific speculations which often paralleled and in some cases went beyond those of the Greeks, yet these took place in an atmosphere unlike that of Greece, an atmosphere in which formal obeisance to Islam was demanded. Although severe persecution for heresy was rare except in the case of actual or anticipated sectarian revolt, the early 'Abbasid persecutions of those 31</page><page sequence="6">accused of Manicheanism, the zindiqs, and their crucifixion of the mystic al-Hallaj, served as warnings against too great liberties in expression, and in subsequent centuries orthodoxy became increasingly powerful. After the very earliest period nearly all intellectual and sectarian opposition movements, however far their thought might be from the prevailing religion, began to claim that they alone were the true Muslims, represen- ting the real ideas of the Prophet and God, and that their opponents were unbelievers. They thus adjusted to the compulsion noted above, to ascribe everything new to the Prophet (or, in the case of some of the Shi'a, to his cousin and son-in-law, the fourth caliph, 'All). Until very recently people could function effectively in the Islamic community only by claiming to be the truest Muslims, and this claim was even made by the most aberrant of the major sectarian movements, the Isma'ili branch of the Shl'a. The physical threat of the Isma'ilis was one of the reasons for the tightening control of narrow-minded orthodoxy, noted, among other places, by the eleventh century Isma'ili author Nasir-i Khusrau, who was forced into exile because of suspicion of his beliefs: Because these self-styled scholars have treated as enemies of faith all those who have scientific knowledge of created things, the searchers of the how and why have become mute; those who teach these sciences keep silent. Ignorance has taken possession of people, especially of the people of our land, Khorasan, and the Oriental lands... ... And no one makes books any more on the how and why of things, because of the five necessary causes to the production of a book of science, we have lacked the fifth, the perfect cause, which is the researcher on this science; and we have lacked also someone who could teach this science... These two causes having disappeared among the people of this country, the science of religion ('ilm-i Din) has disappeared also... These self-styled scholars have declared that philosophy is an enemy of faith, whereas in this country there no longer remains either True Religion or philosophy (1). The long-standing opposition of the orthodox to religious and (1) Henry Corbin and Mohammad Mo'in, eds., Nasir-e Khosraw, Kitab-e jami' al-hikmalain: Le liure reunissant les deux sagesses (Tehran and Paris, 1953), pp. 62-63 of the introduction and pp. 15-16 of the Persian text. 32 NIKKI R. KEDDIE</page><page sequence="7">SYMBOL AND SINCERITY IN ISLAM philosophic speculation became most effective with the develop- ment of feudalism, expansion of nomadism, and the decline of the expanding urban economy and society which had encouraged freer speculation. In the eleventh century the Seljuq Turks and their Iranian administrators made the restoration of Sunni orthodoxy after an interval of Shi'ite control of the caliphate a conscious aim, and imitated their Egyptian Isma'ili opponents by patronizing religious schools in which even the bureaucrats were to be trained. The reconciliation of mysticism with orthodoxy, associated with the great theologian al-Ghazali (d. 1111), was probably an inevitable aspect of the growing trend to conformity. However far the Sufi orders of the suc- ceeding centuries strayed, they rarely openly challenged orthodoxy. When modernizers began to ask for change in the nineteenth century, they had to appeal to people whose external conformism had usually not seriously been challenged for centuries, and the only traditional basis to demand change within the Islamic community was a claim that the change was really Islamic, whereas current practice was not. Innova- tion, in other words, has at various times been more radical than in many other tradition-oriented societies, but even at its most radical it has claimed, however forcedly, to represent true and original Islam. 4) The frequency of foreign invasion and changes of ruler, along with the early development of an attitude that any government is an evil to be tolerated, encouraged the develop- ment of dissimulation towards representatives of government. Hiding one's true beliefs, one's financial status, and anything else necessary to avoid trouble was considered natural, particularly as governments were increasingly foreign, military, and not felt to be representing the interests of the people in any way. 5) As noted above, elitism became increasingly characteristic of Islamic society. One's own group - the theologians, the philosophers, a single sect or Sufi order - was often regarded as the only one whose members were capable of apprehending the full truth, while for the rest of the Muslims literalist belief in the law was accepted as the best goal. The idea of levels of 3 33</page><page sequence="8">34 NIKKI R. KEDDIE teaching corresponding to the level of the hearer was present in orthodoxy as well as among the Sufis and the sects, and contradictory ideas directed to different audiences have been attributed to the theologians as well as the philosophers (1). Given this background, when contradictory ideas are found in a modern author, as in Afghani's Refulation of the Materialists and his ((Letter to Renan ), it may be possible to explain them on the grounds that some words are directed to the masses and others to the elite (2). For all these factors strengthening trends to dissimulation, esoterism, and fabrication in Islam, it is clear that some of the above also existed in other traditions. In particular, any revealed religion tends to hold that all knowledge has been divulged in the past, and any apparent novelty must be implicit in this past revelation. Also, in the absence of rapid scientific and social progress, the idea of the relativity of knowledge at any particular moment and its growth over time usually does not occur (3). If a believer supposes something to be good, he may in good faith invent an ancient authority for it - pseudoepigraphy being as common in Judaism and (1) See, for instance, the discussion of the ( two-way Ash'ari in G. Makdisi, ( Ash'ari and the Ash'arites in Islamic Religious History ?, Sludia Islamica, XVII (1962), 37-80. See also the remarks below on theology. (2) In a forthcoming work I will indicate the way in which the Refulalion is composed to convey one meaning to a mass audience while hinting at another meaning for the elite, in the manner of the Islamic philosophers. A similar view on Afghani was reached independently by Sylvia Haim, in Arab Nationalism (Berkeley, 1962), pp. 6-15. Albert Hourani's discussion of Afghani in Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age, 1798-1939 (London, 1962) notes influences of the philosophical tradition, but considers both this tradition and Afghani more truly Muslim than I do. (3) Islamic civilization is rather notable among traditional cultures for having produced a few figures who suggested the idea of progress in knowledge; notably the 10th century physician and philosopher Razi, who also dismissed revelation as spurious; Averroes, who suggested it might be necessary to rectify even his master, Aristotle; Ibn KhaldOn, who saw himself as establishing a K new science to facili- tate the proper understanding and writing of history; and certain Ismi'ilis, who believed in cycles of increasingly perfect revelation, which would go on even in the future. G. E. von Grunebaum, Islam (Menasha, Wisconsin, 1955), p. 71 notes various statements of superiority of the present to the past, but states also that these were peculiar to the 9th and 10th centuries and were found particularly in heterodox circles.</page><page sequence="9">SYMBOL AND SINCERITY 1N ISLAM Christianity as in Islam. And the need for stabilizing myths about past authorities has not ended with the idea of progress - witness the American myths about the Founding Fathers and the Constitution, and the practice of some Soviet scholars of quoting Marx as scripture to give legitimacy to their works, even when there is no clear relevance. FABRICATION OF TRADITIONS, ALLEGORICAL INTERPRETATION, AND ESOTERISM AMONG THE ORTHODOX It has been suggested above that certain peculiar attitudes to literal truthfulness seem to pervade the whole Islamic community, both orthodox and heterodox, until recent times. While these trends were stronger among the heterodox, who often were forced to hide their true beliefs, it is worth noting how strong they were even among the orthodox. Although the term ((orthodox)) is not strictly applicable to the first Islamic centuries, it will be used here as a convenient designation for certain trends which had the support of the majority of the pious and/or of the government. And, although orthodoxy does not always mean adherence to the original spirit of a religion, it does seem that the trends discussed here are somewhat closer to original Islam than are most of the heterodox trends to be discussed later - a circumstance not too surprising in a religion whose founder was also a political ruler who, although he introduced reforms, did not demand a radical change in personal habits or an end to class differences (1). The placing of other values above what moderns might call the truth is best illustrated in the rapid development and rise to authority of the hadflh or Tradition - a saying attributed to the Prophet, which was increasingly supposed to have divine origin and to be a theoretically unbreakable precedent in law, dogma, and personal behavior. The epochal work of Goldziher (1) On the social role of Muhammad see W. Montgomery Watt, Muhammad at Mecca (Oxford, 1953), and Muhammad at Medina (Oxford, 1956); and Maxim Rodinson, a The Life of Muhammad and the Sociological Problem of the Beginning of Islam ,, Diogenes, XX (Winter, 1957), 28-51. 35</page><page sequence="10">NIKKI R. KEDDIE on the hadiths, recently supplemented by that of Schacht in the field of law, have demonstrated the way in which the vast majority of the hadtlhs were invented in the interests of various parties (1). It is worth summarizing some of their results here, with some additional remarks about the historical ambience and the peculiar attitude to truth displayed in the traditional scholarly acceptance of hadlth invention. At the time of the Islamic conquests of the 7th century, Islam consisted of the not always clear precepts of the Qur'gn, and certain practices of the early community, which were not everywhere remembered or followed. Although Islam was both a political and a religious guide, there was simply no precedent in Islam for most of the problems with which the caliphs and their administrators had to deal. And so, even the first four ((pious)) or ((orthodox)) caliphs adopted a largely ad hoc or ((secular)) policy - often simply taking over administrative and tax practices, as well as administrators and tax-collectors, from the conquered peoples, and dealing with new problems in a practical way. Recent research has indicated that the Umayyads, who came to power thirty years after the death of the Prophet and established dynastic rule for the first time, did not upset the ( pious ) rule of their predecessors by establishing a secular kingdom, as their 'Abb5sid successors claimed. Rather, there was a broad continuity of development, with the early Umayyads being about as ad hoc and ( secular ) as their predecessors, while some of the later ones began to unify and ( Islamicize ) certain patterns of government (2). What seems striking about the relations of religion and politics in the first Islamic centuries is the growing and increa- singly successful pressure, both learned and popular, both Arab and non-Arab, to Islamicize governement and administra- (1) I.

Polk (Boston, 1962), 34-45. 36</page><page sequence="11">SYMBOL AND SINCERITY IN ISLAM tion, a movement in which hadtlh invention played a key role. While at first glance there is nothing surprising about the fact that a political religion like Islam developed a ((theocratic B form of government, there was not a simple imposition from the first of an Islamic scheme on politics. On the contrary, for over a century there were both frank and unashamed borrowings from non-Muslims and secular innovations; while in law, personal judgment and the living practice of the community were considered along with the Qur'an. Yet this practical, and, from a modern point of view rather ((straight- forward ) arrangement was not permitted to last. Perhaps because the Umayyads, like all their successors, failed to fulfill the equalitarian promises which many saw in Islam, but instead favored a particular Arab group, they were never popular outside Syria. The opposition centered on the supposed deviation of the Umayyads from the practices and precepts of Muhammad and the pious Companions who had succeeded him - and indeed proof of such a deviation would be the only way in this early period to prove a government unlslamic. Thus, opposi- tion to the Umayyads, originating from various causes, found its ideological expression in an appeal to the supposed practice of Muhammad and the early caliphs, an appeal for which invention of hadflhs ascribed to the Prophet or his companions was most useful. This does not mean that hadUlh invention necessarily originated in party struggles, but these were certainly a strong contributing factor. As the ((pious opposi- tionn invented hadflhs, the Umayyads surely invented coun- tering ones, though few of these were allowed to survive (1). The ((style ) of attributing wisdom and proper practice to the past was current among both the pre-Islamic Arabs and the conquered peoples. The intensity of party struggle in the early Islamic period must have added to the propensity to attribute the ideas of each group to original Islam. Not only was there an Umayyad anti-Umayyad struggle, but the opposition itself was divided among the partisans of the family of 'All; the Kharijite sects who wanted the caliph chosen by the (1) See Goldziher, Eludes, ch. II, III. 37</page><page sequence="12">NIKKI R. KEDDIE whole community; and the more simply pious. All these groups had religious ideologies, and to support themselves as representing the true Islamic tradition, the attribution of their way to the Prophet was almost a necessity. At the same time there were increasing conversions from non-Islamic peoples, some of them motivated by a desire to escape discriminatory taxes or to retain prestige, and these peoples brought in customs and ideas foreign to Islam. In a community which increasingly stressed piety and conformity to the practice of the founders, it was natural that these people too should attribute their customs to the Prophet and Compa- nions. A striking fact about this development was that it strengthened as temporal distance from the Prophet grew. While in the first century people might ignore the words and practice of the Prophet, in the second and third centuries the latter came to be increasingly certain guides, finally being put on the plane of divine inspiration where the Qur'an already stood. And in the field of law the traditionists won out over the more pragmatic early schools, so that legal decisions had more and more to be ascribed to sayings of the Prophet himself. This trend naturally resulted in increased fabrication of hadi'hs. In law there was hardly any alternative to ascribing the needed sentiments to the Prophet - often the very same ones which had previously been ascribed to the living practice of the community or to personal judgment. As contradictory hadlths on the same legal situation naturally came into circulation, legists worked out ingenious methods to harmonize them. The Islamic community thus increasingly rejected the secular and ad hoc treatment of problems, and the frank borrowings from non-Islamic practices of the early period, in favor of attribution to the Prophet of innovation, an attribution which was supposed to mean divine sanction. The pressure for a divinely sanctioned community, which appeared in opposition to the Umayyads, in the rise of the 'Abbasids, and then in the opposition to the 'Abbasids, appeared in another form in hadtlh invention and the rise of hadlth to canonical authority for law and daily life. This took place despite the fact that it was 38</page><page sequence="13">SYMBOL AND SINCERITY IN ISLAM widely realized that the hadlths were falsified and invented. A peculiar attitude to the literal truth shows up in the attitude that anything good or pious must have been in the mind of the Prophet, and therefore it was proper to attribute a saying about it to him, whether or not he actually may have said it. The ( authenticity ) of a hadlth was thus tied to what most of the community considered good, and typically, sayings of the Prophet were circulated to justify this concept: When I am no longer here... the words attributed to me will multiply, just as there have been attributed a large number of sentences to the prophets who preceded me. That which is presented to you as having been my words, you must compare with the book of God... That which agrees with the Koran, know that it is from me, whether I said it myself or not (1). The greatest indulgence was shown toward the invention of Traditions as long as they voiced sentiments which were generally considered edifying and favorable to piety, and some direct admissions of invention for such purposes have come down to us. On the other hand, if the invention of Traditions was a fair game for the pious Muslim, it was bound to be taken up by new converts and others bringing in aberrant ideas: It is hardly too much to say that all the wisdom of the Middle East became incorporated in Traditions, ancient Arab wisdom, sentences from the Old and New Testaments, Neoplatonic and Gnostic doctrines, and maxims from Persia and India... Much of this material was clearly inconsistent with Islam, and must have worried the leaders of the main body of moderate Muslims, but those who believed in one or other part of it saw that by passing it off as coming from Muhammad they justified their own belief in it ('). Toward such aberrant inventions there was less indulgence. But the mood of the time is shown in the fact that people fought inventions with new inventions, making up hadflh to condemn the making up of hadlh. The Prophet was made to predict and condemn in the strongest terms any false attribution of (1) Ibid., p. 59. (2) W. Montgomery Watt, Islam and the Integration of Society (Evanston, Ill., 1961), p. 225. 39</page><page sequence="14">NIKKI R. KEDDIE words to him (1). Obviously, through most of the Islamic community, it was the content of a Tradition, and not whether the Prophet actually said it, which determined its ((truth)), The same fact shows up in the method finally adopted for sifting the c true ) Traditions from the vast and contradictory mass in circulation. The method involved a purely external criticism of the chain of guarantors of Tradition. This did not in fact lead to the discarding of Traditions which did not go back to the Prophet - such a procedure'might have meant the throwing out of 99 % of the hadlth, which was something no one in the community except perhaps some freethinkers wanted (2). The procedure did lead to the sifting out of many aberrant Traditions, however, and the canonization of a body which were mostly in accord with orthodox views. The story of hadTth invention thus shows the growing dominance of a current which favored prophetic or divine sanction for all practices, even when this involved deliberate fabrication. The fact that such fabrication was indulgently recognized in the case of pious or edifying sentiments directed at the people does not mean that the majority of the people knew that they were being misled. To imagine that the process of hadrth invention had any real effectiveness, one must assume that the avowals of invention quoted by Goldzilier came from (1) Goldziher, op. cit., p. 162: , With a pious aim, people combatted inventions by new inventions, by new hadilh introduced fraudulently in which people made the Prophet forbid, in severe terms, the interpolation of illegitimate traditions. People invented words of the Prophet which prohibited and stigmatized very strongly the false in traditions, whether it was a question of pure and simple invention or of falsification and interpolation in texts which were ancient and recognized as worthy of faith. ? The most widespread of these Traditions was, ( Whoever lies intentionally regarding me, let him take a place in the fire of Hell. ,, (2) Attacks on the validity of the whole body of Traditions and mockery of the hadiths were still fairly widespread in intellectual circles in the 2nd and 3rd centu- ries after Muhammad. See Goldziher, op. cit., p. 165. Alfred Guillaume, The Traditions of Islam (Oxford, 1924), p. 81, says, , the independent thinkers of the second and third centuries openly mocked and derided the system as a whole and the persons and matters named therein. Some of the most flagrant examples of these lampoons will be found in the Book of Songs, where indecent stories are cast into the form in which tradition was customarily handed down to posterity ,. With the tightening of orthodoxy after this time, however, such open mockery becomes infrequent. 40</page><page sequence="15">SYMBOL AND SINCERITY IN ISLAM the more sophisticated, and that the masses genuinely believed the quoted words came from the Prophet. There seems to have been a class element, which has not yet been studied, in the indulgent attitude towards the invention of hadfths to keep people behaving properly. The masses wanted a religiously oriented law and government, and the 'Abbasids and orthodox leaders agreed, but wished to determine the type of religiously sanctioned activities which were presented to the masses. The elitism which will be seen as a key element in other aspects of pious fabrication thus seems also to be found in hadlth invention. The recasting of the lives, sayings, and principles of the Prophet and his Companions has reappeared in modern times. It should be clear that here the modernists are acting according to a ((style)) already sanctioned by centuries of tradition, one perhaps consciously adopted both then and now as the best way of reaching the religiously-oriented masses with a particular message. Hadrlh invention was probably most important in the central field of Islamic law. Scholars have noted the emphasis of Islam on practice rather than belief, and it has been suggested that the role played by theology in the West was played rather by jurisprudence in Islam. There is not space here to detail the ways in which fabrication entered the sphere of jurispru- dence, but it should be noted that once the traditionist sentiment, represented most effectively by the great jurist Shafi'i, succeeded in ousting personal judgment and the living practice of the community as sources of law, there was little alternative to the wholesale attribution to the Prophet of procedures and judgments reached by other means. Great ingenuity had to be devoted to reconciling contradictory Traditions, or to making a clear Tradition mean something other than it did for a given case, so that forced interpretations of texts became as common in jurisprudence as in theology. Where texts were unequivocal, as in the Qur'anic prohibition of interest, several legal operations might be worked out to accomplish the illegal one without breaking the letter of the law. With the closing of the door of ijlihad, making the sacred 41</page><page sequence="16">law a fixed canon, an ever-widening gulf developed between legal theory and practice, although it was partially bridged by changing interpretations by jurists of what the fixed canon meant. To meet changing needs an increasing amount of what we would call law was either decreed by governments or adopted from local custom. Outside of the Maliki school in North Africa, however, this was never given the status and dignity of sacred law, even though much of the latter might actually be ignored in legal practice. Thus some of the same attitude developed toward the sacred law as did toward the Qur'an. Both encompassed divine and theoretically unalterable texts whose interpretation might vary, but whose letter might not be changed or questioned. And while the clear prescriptions of either might in many cases be ignored with impunity it was wrong to refer to such deviations. The assumption of a scant, or rather ( symbolic ) relation, between paper laws and actual practice is one which has come down to today. And, as scholars have noted, modern Muslim governments have been far more willing to adopt Western legal codes and principles in practice than to admit that the sacred law has been abrogated. The long existence of a theoretically unchanging body of sacred law whose relation to practice has diminished over the centuries has surely reinforced the notion that what is really true is something above, and perhaps even in contradiction with, the contingent everyday reality and practice of this world. Thus the sphere of jurisprudence shows not only in its origins, but also in its later development, special notions of the meaning of truth, which are reflected even in recent times (1). If jurisprudence was the central Islamic science, theology was, by contrast, always somewhat suspect among the literal- minded jurists and Traditionists, who often constituted the strongest section of the 'ulama'. It has recently been shown that this hostility and suspicion continued for centuries after the supposed triumph of Ash'arite theology in the 11th century with the writings of al-Ghazali and the patronage of Nizam (1) See Schacht, .

This hostility seems to have reflected a fear that the introduction of reasoning into the interpretation of texts which ought,to be accepted with no questions asked, might lead to a weakening of belief and, perhaps, a downgrading of the Traditionists themselves. It may have been such suspicions and accusations which encouraged within the ranks of the theologians, who from the first were concerned primarily with defending Islam from its enemies, tendencies to limit publicity of their views similar to those to be noted among the suspect heterodox trends. Thus the theologians, like the philosophers, increasingly stressed the need to restrict their science to a few intellectuals while inculcating the masses with literalist ortho- doxy and discouraging them from asking questions about the sacred texts. Within the ranks of the theologians there is also found another element of double meaning, namely symbolic interpretation of the scripture. Islamic theology first arose in response to attacks from more sophisticated opponents among the conquered peoples, particularly Manicheans and Christians, who had in their arsenal the weapons of Greek philosophy. The first major school to adopt these weapons for defense and counterattack were the Mu'tazila, who went further in the direction of rationalistic interpretation than the community was later willing to allow. It was the Mu'tazilites who first made significant use of allegorical interpretation of the Qur'an, or la'wll. They used it to explain away anthropomorphism and other features of scripture which appeared incompatible with reason. Even after the Mu'tazila lost official favor and were persecuted, eventually dying out, much of their system remained in the Shi'a; and the tradition of using Greek logic to rationalize religion, as well as allegorical interpretation of scripture, although with narrower limits, was adopted by their theological successors. If there were elements of a class attitude towards the truth in scholarly indulgence towards hadilh invention, such an (1) Makdisi, op. cit., and , Muslim Institutions of Learning in Eleventh Century Baghdad , Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Sludies, XXIV (1961), 1-56. 43</page><page sequence="18">attitude is even clearer in the post-Mu'tazilite theologians. In order to satisfy those intellectuals who demanded something more systematic than the prophetic utterances of the Qur'an, books were written which gave rational arguments for the abso- lute omnipotence of God and other central doctrines.One main line of argument was that God created the world anew every moment and was not hindered by any natural law, apparent natural regularities being simply part of his mercy to mankind. The arguments used to support such theses were long and subtle, and they were specifically defensive against more rationalistic views. At the same time the theologians had to justify themselves to the literalists, partly by conceding literalism for the majority. The growth within Islam over the centuries of a belief that a full understanding of the truth is necessarily restricted has often been remarked upon, but has not been adequately studied. It can be noted that the masses in the early Islamic centuries frequently tended either to sectarianism or to extreme literalism, depending on time and location (1). Both these trends might have encouraged scholarly elitism - sectarianism by showing the dangers of opening publicly the Pandora's box of allegorical interpretation and literalism simply by its popular strength. And as the hope for social reform and equalitarianism became more remote over the centuries, and class stratifications became more rigid, intellectual elitism was perhaps a natural concomi- tant. The general elitist attitude is strongly expressed by the respected theologian al-Ghazali, despite the fact that he attacked the abstract scholasticism of the theologians and tried to give theological respectability to the hitherto rather suspect experiences of popular mysticism. To Ghaz5al the mystic path was only for a select few. In more than one work, including ((The Restraining of the Masses from the Study of Theology,), he stressed that the masses should not question (1) For an analysis of this phenomenon, see Claude Cahen, . La changeante portee sociale de quelques doctrines religieuses , in L'dlaboration de l'Islam (Paris, 1961). 44 NIKKI R. KEDDIE</page><page sequence="19">SYMBOL AND SINCERITY IN ISLAM the meaning of scripture and that the 'ulama' should refrain from trying to explain difficult questions and from giving the true symbolic meaning of texts. Only those for whom literal interpretations open doubts and difficulties which cause them to lose faith should be exposed to any non-literal interpretation, and even they should not necessarily be given the truest interpretation, which should be reserved for those who devote themselves wholly to knowing God. Ghazali also argues that the first Muslim leaders deliberately avoided allegorical inter- pretations from fear of shaking popular faith. Echoing Plato, whose advocacy of the (noble lie ? was often followed by Muslim philosophers and theologians, Ghazali says that God created men with innately different capacities, as he created different grades of stones and metals. The masses must believe that God knows all, but like a king can be approached only by a e vizir ), to whom he reveals what secrets he pleases, while the masses cannot approach him at all. There are three levels of argument he says, echoing the Muslim philosophers he denounced on other questions, and the level of argument used must be adapted to the person (1). The interdependence of social and intellectual elitism is shown both in the modification of the Platonic tradition, wherein the author himself apparently believes in the innate fundamental differences of men, and in the analogy with temporal government. Ghazali's expressed attitude to literal truthfulness is also a typical one for the Islamic community, and has been summarized from his words as follows: In fact, language is the means to achieve a goal. If the praiseworthy goal can be achieved without lies, strict truth- fulness is obligatory and lies are absolutely forbidden. If the praiseworthy goal cannot be achieved except by a lie, the latter is obligatory if the goal is necessary, optional if the end is only permissible ('). This attitude runs throughout Islamic history; it is sanctioned (1) Al-Ghazali, I lljam al 'awamm 'an 'ilm al kalam ,, in El juslo medio en la creencia, tr. M. Asin Palacios (Madrid, 1929), pp. 384-417. (2) Abd-el-Jalil, J. M., ? Autour de la sinc6rit6 d'al-Gazzali , Mdlanges Louis Massignon, I (Damascus, 1956), p. 64. 45</page><page sequence="20">by hadllhs, by didactic poets, notably Sa'di, and here by theology. In the Islamic world, on questions of literal truth- fulness the religious end has usually been held to justify the means, even though there were many who condemned this attitude, and others who refrained from its public expression. In closing this brief survey of orthodox or majority trends, a word should be said about centuries of experience of religious hypocrisy, which taught people to expect a difference between words and reality. Although hypocrisy is hardly specifically Islamic, the fact that justice was religious, and that most governments from the time of the 'Abbasids were careful to take on a religious aura, meant that administrators made for them- selves religious and moral claims that often jarred badly with both their personal habits and self-interested administrative behavior. The 'Abb5sids, who made such a point of encouraging orthodoxy, were notorious in their personal behavior, and the habits of venal religious judges and Siifis became favorite points of ridicule. Thus, there can be seen in the main tradition of Islam a compulsion to refer borrowings and innovations to the Prophet or to scripture, the use of forced or allegorical interpretations of scripture, a casual attitude to untruths and fabrications with pious purpose, and a distinction between the higher truth taught the elite and the simpler views alone appropriate to the masses. The religiosity of the masses helped force all spheres to take on a putative religious colori'ng, but this religiosity was itself encouraged and channeled by a section of the ruling classes along lines they found desirable, partly through the encourage- ment of pious inventions or half-truths. DISSIMULATION AND ESOTERISM IN IIETERODOX TRADITIONS However strong fabrication and pragmatic attitudes to the truth were in orthodox and majority circles, they, and also esoterism and dissimulation, were far stronger in circles which came to be defined as heterodox. Although, given the lack of regular councils or ecclesiastical hierarchies, heterodoxy was no 46 NIKKI R. KEDDIE</page><page sequence="21">SYMBOL AND SINCERITY IN ISLAM more clearly defined than orthodoxy in Islam, the three groups to be discussed here were regarded as suspect for centuries, and subject to various types of persecution. These three were the Shi'a, particularly in its extreme or sectarian forms, the mystics, or Sufis, and the philosphers. Heterodox ideas also affected the orthodox, particularly with the spread and taming of Sufism. There were in addition a number of even more suspect freethinkers or atheists, but very little avowedly free- thinking writing has come down to us, ,so that it is difficult to say much about this group. It should be kept in mind, however, that in an atmosphere where persecution was possible and public opinion often fanatical, various authors may have been freethinkers or atheists but maintained a prudent silence - tlis seems to have been probable in at least a few cases, and would fit well into a general style of precautionary silence about dangerous questions in public (1). The sectarian Shi'a, the philosophers, and the Sufis are groups which show some strong interconnections. In particular, a Neo-Platonic cosmology which sees creation as a process of successive emanations from the unmoving One through planes corresponding to the celestial spheres and ending with the lowest emanation of the multiple and contingent world, and salvation as reascent of these planes to reunion with the One, is common to a part of all three groups. Such a scheme is utterly foreign to the Qur'anic concept of a vast gulf between God and man, and to the orthodox notion that the ways of God are unknowable and bound by no rational pattern. Neo-Platonism appears first among the philosophically minded, and is found in philosophers like Farabi, Avicenna, (1) On free thought see F. Gabrieli, a La 'Zandaqa' au ler siecle abbaside , in L'elaboralion de l'Islam. Gabrieli notes that it was possible for freethinkers of the early Abbasid period to be Manicheans because of a tradition of allegorical interpretation of Manichean mythology; and he traces a link between such Manicheans and Ibn ar-Rawandi, who was a rationalist of an almost 18th century type who rejected prophecy and revelation. Governmental persecution of the zindlqs taught later freethinkers to be most circumspect about expressing their opinions. The allegorical schemes worked out by the philosophers and the Shi'a probably enabled freethinkers to operate under the Islamic aegis as they had earlier under the Manichean. 47</page><page sequence="22">NIKKI R. KEDDIE and the Iranian philosophic scliool of more recent centuries ; in the Ism5'il! Shi'a from the 10th century on; in philosophical mystics like Ibn al-'Arab! and Suhrawardi; and, particularly after the destruction of the Isma'ilis' political power and their consequent mei'ging with the Sfifis, in Suifi theosophy and poetry. There are also other similarities among the three groups. For example, despite the aberrance of their ideas, all are concerned to uphold their orthodoxy, using the expedients to be discussed below. In his frank rejection of prophecy ar-R5zi is as exceptional as he is in his denial that philosophy is accessible only to the elite, and he is not generally counted among the school of falsafa (1). After the early centuries it was no longer possible to express free thought so openly, so the claim to orthodoxy was in part a simple necessity, and may not in all cases have been sincere. In addition all three groups manifest a feeling which we may call in modern terms alienalion from society as it was. Whereas for the orthodox life lived in this world according to ordinary religious prescriptions was considered meaningful enough, however imperfect the world, as a prelude to the desired salvation, to the heterodox the ordinary standards of society and orthopraxy did not make up a meaningful existence. Yet unlike the cynics, who also existed, they found meaning and truer reality somewhere else - and the idea that the real meaning of existence must be outside the everyday plane of the (1) Gabrieli, op. cit., pp. 35-37 summarizes the fragments of Razi discovered and published by Paul Kraus. ,, If a book could be admitted as proof (hujja), it would be scientific books like the Almagest or books of logic, of geometry and of medicine, much more than this useless hodge-podge of ineptitudes [the Qur'an] which would merit such a privilege. Thus positive science, which is the basis of ar-Razi's thought, should take the place of revelation - science which has been the cause of all benefits to the human race, whereas religious hatreds and struggles have filled the earth with blood and sown it with ruins. The Ptolemies, Euclids, and Hippo- crates, are the true prophets : not at all in the sense, which his Isma'ill opponent tries to insinuate, that under the factitious names of these ancient sages prophetic revelations were really presented ; but in the sense that rational knowledge and the scientific heritage of antiquity are directly opposed to the dogmatic patrimony of Muslim civilization. And one can judge by this if Muslim orthodoxy was not right to distrust these suspect Ancients. X (p. 36). On Razi's exceptional belief that philosophy was useful for all men, see B. Walzer, Greek into Arabic (Oxford, 1962), pp. 15-16. 48</page><page sequence="23">SYMBOL AND SINCERITY IN ISLAM world as it now is is one clue to the centrality of esoterism in all these groups. Alienation from an unjust, imperfect, venal, and formalistic world which cannot be granted the status of true reality helps give the prose and poetry of writers from these groups a poignant appeal which leaps the bounds of centuries, even when the Neo-Platonic exegeses of such works may leave us cold. Avicenna's visionary tale, (( The Recital of the Bird ), for example, opens with a cry from the heart against a world in which friendship has become a commerce, and proceeds to describe the plight of souls caught in the miserable trap of everyday reality (1). The questions of where, how, and by whom true meaning is to be found sharply divide the three groups, for all their similarities and interpenetrations. The sectarian Shi'a, who were particularly strong in the early centuries of Islam, when the economy was expanding, social change and dislocation were rapid, and hopes for radical improvements were aroused, expected a politico-religious solution to the injustices of this world. To the earliest purely political Shi'a, claiming that the caliphate had been illegally usurped from the house of the Prophet, was soon added a messianic-rebellious element, drawn from non-Arabs, and incorporating various local sectarian, (1) T The Recital of the Bird ? is in Henry Corbin, Avicenna and the Visionary Recital, tr. Willard R. Trask (New York, 1960), pp. 186-192. The opening lines are: , Is there none among my brothers who will lend me ear for a time, that I may confide some part of my sorrows to him ? Perhaps he could fraternally share my burden. For the friendship of a friend is not unalloyed unless, in good as in evil fortune, he guards its purity from all stain. But where shall I find so pure and sincere a friend, in a time when friendship has become a traffcking to which one turns when the necessities of a situation require an application to one's friend, whereas one ceases one's attentions to him as soon as the need is gone ? No longer is a friend visited save when you yourself liave been visited by misfortune ; no longer is a friend remembered save when some necessity has restored your memory. There are, it is true, brothers united by the same divine kinship, friends who are brought together by the same frequentation of what is above; they contemplate the True Realities with the eyes of inner vision ; they have purified the depths of their hearts from all stains of doubt. Such a society of brothers can be assembled only by the herald of a divine vocation... ) See also the mystic Bistami's ( God fools you in this life in the market, and in the other, in the market; you find yourself, and forever, the slave of the market. , Louis Massignon, Essai sur les origines du lexique technique de la mystique musulmane, New ed.

To the Shi'ite sectarians meaningful reality was associated with the millenium to be inaugurated very soon by the mahdl (messiah), usually from the house of 'All, and usually supported by armed revolt. The strength of such sentiment in the early Islamic centuries is indicated by the fact that two caliphates with universal pretensions, the 'Abbasids and the Fatimids, came to power largely through the support of Shi'ite sectarians, whose messianic expectations are clearly enough indicated by the fact that rulers in both caliphates took a series of messianic reign-names, including, in both cases, al-Mahdi. With the decline of the Isma'ili Fatimid caliphate, and the failure of the Isma'ili Assassins in Iran, followed by the spread of feudalism and orthodoxy, messianic revolt and hopes for political transformation tended to decline until the modern period. Increasingly the individual path to meaningfulness and salvation of the iSfis replaced the political way of the Shi'a among the alienated masses. The Siuf was concerned with the approach of the individual soul to God, not with collective salvation through revolt. To be sure, there was a collective element in late Sufism, in the brotherhoods and worship of their saints, but there seems rarely to have been among the Siufis an expectation of political perfection in this world, and the Sufis were generally noted more for political quietism than for the activism found in the sects. Those Sufi groups which were politically active before the 19th century were usually heavily tinged with Shi'i-sectarian ideas, as in the case of the $Sfis who backed the rise of the Ottoman and Safavid dynasties in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were later disowned in the name of orthodoxy. To the philosophers and their followers, meaning was to be found through rational understanding of the workings of the cosmos, which could be achieved only by a very small intellectual (1) On the early Shi'a see especially Marshall G. S. Hodgson, a How did the Early Shi'a Become Sectarian ,, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 75 (1955); Alessandro Bausani, Persia Religiosa (Milan, 1959), and I. Friedlander, The Hetero- doxies of the Shi'ites in the Presentation of Ibn Hazm, reprinted from the JAOS,. 1907. 50</page><page sequence="25">SYMBOL AND SINCERITY IN ISLAM elite. Politically they shared the orthodox dislike of sectaria- nism and distrust of the masses, and hoped at best to improve the world by educating rulers in proper principles of government. If the three groups are differentiated by where they placed the locus of meaningful human existence, and by their political attitudes, they are also demarcated by the groups they appealed to. Sifism was from the first primarily a lower class movement although it always had adherents from other groups. Philo- sophy was naturally reserved for those who had the means to afford an advanced education, and drew from what we would call ( professionals ) - Razi and Avicenna were great doctors, Averroes both doctor and lawyer, and Ibn Khaldun a lawyer and judge. The Shi'i sects were mostly lower class, but it is a noteworthy feature of Isma'ilism that it provided something for every group, popular religious notions for the common people, and a more sophisticated philosophical orientation for the elite. After this summary treatment of the similarities and differences of three heterodox groups, it is worth discussing some of the features of esoterism and dissimulation central to them. Some of these features have already been seen among the orthodox, but they are far stronger among the heterodox. They can be defined by a series of Arabic terms which have also passed over into other languages of the Middle East, and which are so much more common and meaningful than their sometimes inexact translations that they are generally used in the original Arabic in Western works. Sometimes, especially among the Sufis and philosophers, different terms were used for similar concepts. 1) Taqlya, or ((dissimulation ), the practice of hiding or denying one's true beliefs, generally for cautionary reasons. In the Islamic world this seems to have originated with the first sectarian group, the Kh5rijites, as a necessary defence against persecution, and also to permit social intercourse with ordinary Muslims, who were, strictly speaking, regarded as unbelievers. Dissimulation of one's true religious beliefs was permitted by many of the orthodox under certain circumstances, as when it was necessary in order to save one's life - orthodoxy 51</page><page sequence="26">NIKKI R. KEDDIE seems to have preferred live Muslims to martyrs. It soon became standard practice for the Shi'a, particularly in enemy territory, and for Sufls and philosophers. The persecution and even execution of Shi'ite leaders quickly made it a necessity in the Shi'ite community. Among the Sufis the execution of al-Hallaj led to the charge that he had been guilty of unveiling the arcane in his claim of union with the divine, and a recommen- dation of precautionary public silence or dissimulation. Among both Sufis and Shi'ites, although the cautionary motive probably predominated in early Iaqlya, there developed the notion that there was something religiously wrong or desecrating about revealing one's true beliefs to the non-initiate, and indeed only the initiate would be able to understand them. More extreme sects with greater deviations from Islamic ideas than the Shi'a, such as the Nusairis, Druzes, Ahl-i I;Iaqq, and Babis also use laqTya. Until recently even the written texts of some such sects, as also of the Isma'ilis, have been a closely guarded secret ('). Among the philosophers dissimulation was also enjoined for both prudential and principled'reasons, although the principle in this case was not supernatural. Rather, it was that the open discussion of philosophic principles and rational, symbolic interpretations of scripture would sow confusion among the masses, leading them to sectarianism and revolt. The question obviously arises, to what degree can we believe the writings, or indeed know anything about the beliefs, of people who on principle dissemble their beliefs ? The question is not easy to answer, although in the field of philosophy recent steps toward a useful approach have been made (2). It seems that the reaction of some Western scholars against orthodox slanders of the heterodox has gone too far in its efforts to prove the orthodoxy of many Shi'ites, Suifis, and philosophers. The fact that they claimed orthodoxy proves little except the strength of pressures encouraging such claims. 2) Zdhir and Bdlin, literally ((outside )) and ( inside ), usually (1) On iaqiya see von Grunebaum, Medieval Islam, 2nd ed.

(2) See particularly the works mentioned above in n. 1, p. 29. 52</page><page sequence="27">SYMBOL AND SINCERITY IN ISLAM translated c(exoteric and ((esoteric ). These concepts are central to the three trends discussed, and are also found in some strands of orthodoxy. Among the sectarians and the Suifis there early arose the idea that in addition to the obvious, literal, meaning of the scripture, there was a more profound, inner meaning open only to the initiate. Among the Shi'i sects the idea became common that this meaning had been handed over secretly by the Prophet to 'Ali, and by him to his descendents, in whatever line the particular sect happened to believe. Among the Isma'ilis this basic authoritarian and tradition-oriented notion got a a progressive)) twist with the idea that Muhammad realized that men were not yet mature enough for the real truth, which was to be revealed in stages by his successors (1). To the Shi'a, then, the imams of the House of 'All were the source of interpretation of the inner meaning of the Qur'an, although sectarians were not lacking who spoke in the name of the Imam, often without the approval of the latter. Looking to one leader as the source of true guidance was appropriate to the rebellious sects, just as the more individualist approach of personal discipline and contemplation as the path to inner truth, often with the guidance of a local leader, was appropriate to the more quietist Sufis. And the philosophers' approach to zadhir and bdlin was also attuned to their intellectual and political position. According to them, the Qur'an contained crude religious notions for the masses, and at the same time had deliberate obscurities and ambiguities which would lead the philosophically minded to contemplate and to achieve a true rational understanding of religion (a). It is obvious that the notions of zahir and balin were used to justify the incorporation of all sorts of notions which even their advocates saw were foreign to the obvious meaning of the Qur'an. Yet there is more to the question than this point, which is so clear as not to require elaboration. The prominence (1) See P. J. Vatikiotis, The Faliniid Theory of lhe Stale (Lahore, 1952), pp. 36-37, 58, and 89-90. (2) On Batini thought among the sects and Sfifs see M. G. S.

KEDDIE given to badinl interpretations not only of scripture, but of poetry, history, and of the world and its objects in all these movements seems to be tied to their alienation from the everyday world and their conviction that the truest reality must lie elsewhere. In the Neo-Platonic scheme adopted by so many of them this is clear. Since the data of this world are only exoteric signs or symbols of reality, everything must have its badinT explanation to give it meaning. Among the Ism5'ilis there is another way in which the bilin is tied to making life meaningful. The coming of the mahdT and the millenium are to be followed by the ending of the rule of the zdhir, including the religious law, and the substitution of the balin, or under- standing of its meaning, alone. The Ism5'ill Assassins actually proclaimed the Resurrection and the abolition of the sharl'a in 1164. In all three groups the idea that the zdhir law and cult are only outward signs of a bdlin meaning is strong. This led at various times to antinomian trends, based on the belief that one who has understood the bdalin can dispense with the zahir. On the other hand, conformist pressures generally forced strict adherence to the zdhir, even where it might be believed to be valueless. The Fatimid Isma'ilis, perhaps because of their desire to appeal to Sunnites and to discourage politico-religious extremism, were strong in their insistence on fulfillment of the shar'a, and the Assassins only abandoned it after they had been totally anathematized by the Sunni community (1). Just as taqlya tends to become stronger over the centuries, so too does the emphasis on the badin. The obvious failure of the external promise of Islam to institute a regime of unity, good government, some types of equality, and justice, along with the spread of Sufism and its stress on the inner, personal, and mysterious in religion, is probably partly responsible for this trend. Over the years the concept of the bdlin also becomes more elaborate. Already with the Isma'ilis we hear of a (1) On the various Assassin experiences with the shar'a see M. G. S. Hodgson, The Order of the Assassins ('s-Gravenhage, 1955); for the stricter Fatimid attitudes see Vatikiotis, op. cit., passim. 54</page><page sequence="29">SYMBOL AND SINCERITY IN ISLAM badin al-balin, the esoteric interpretation of the esoteric inter- pretation, perhaps for those philosophic Isma'ilis 'who were unhappy with the official esoteric doctrine. And with later Sufis, there are even more levels of possible meaning, in numbers sometimes corresponding, rationally enough, to the number of spheres or emanations. Rumi's Masnau', sometimes called ( the Qur'an of the Sufis n speaks, for example, of seven levels of meaning. It should be stressed here that the idea that external expe- rience and internal reality are completely different is still extre- mely widespread among Muslims ; in Iran it is almost universal. Put forward mainly by a mass Sufi movement precariously assimilated to orthodoxy, and spread largely in widely known poetry, it still helps determine belief and action (1). 3) Ta'wUl, usually translated as ( allegorical interpretation ,, although this translation is open to serious objection. In a gnosticizing or Neo-Platonic scheme the inward interpretation of scripture, or of poetry, or of the world, has little to do with strict allegory, but seeks the truer meaning of the (symbols , which make up this external world. The Arabic has the impli- cation ((return ,, and among recently suggested translations are ((disallegorization a, or, better, {( bringing back to a higher plane. , (2) As has been noted, ta'wll without such Neo-Platonic implications was sometimes used by the orthodox, to deal with contradictory, obscure, or inconvenient passages of scripture, but within strict limits, and even this was rejected by the fundamentalists. The real flowering of Ia'wTl came with the heterodox, who used it to bring out the desired esoteric meaning (1) F. Meier, K Soufisme et d6clin culturel , in Classicisme el ddclin culturel dans l'hisloire de l'Islam, eds. R. Brunschvig and G. E. von Grunebaum (Paris, 1957), suggests a the opinion that the special ... use of the Arabic word haqiqa in the sense of * reality, truth m in the contemporary spoken language (as much in Arabic as in Persian), is strongly influenced by the ulfi conception of the real. For the SQfi what is real is all that is spiritual, divine, supernatural, ideal, mystical; all that is temporal is for him metaphorical (magazi), unreal, false, purely apparent. Thus in the modern language the mahabba haqiqiyya is religious and mystical love, while terrestrial love is only mahabba maadziyya, figurative love. D (p. 229). (2) The first is in W.

KEDDIE from exoteric writings and practices. Since everything was often considered to have a zahir and a deeper bdlin by the Sufis and sectarians, so everything had its ta'wil, even the apparently straightforward passages of scripture. Shl'l ta'wTl was often directed towards showing that the Prophet had singled out the House of 'Ali as his successors, and Siufi a'wdl towards a mystic interpretation of a few passages of scripture. When the Neo- Platonic scheme spread it was imposed on scripture and religious practices in what seems now a very forced fashion, as its ta'wil. A more natural la'wll was applied to the mystic and philosophic tales and poems which were supposed to evoke higher planes of reality through symbols from this world. Just as human experience was a symbol of a higher reality, so the best of these tales and poems exist vividly on both the experiential and the symbolic planes. Most of the best Persian poetry has such a double significance. The Shi'a usually theoretically restricted la'wUl to the Imam, and the Sufis to their leaders, but the real concern over restric- tion of la'wll was voiced by the philosophers. Developing notions suggested by Aristotle and Plato, the philosophers divi- ded manking into the masses, ((the people of rhetoric )), inca- pable of logical reasoning; the dialecticians, including the theologians, who reasoned according to plausible and commonly accepted, but wrong, principles; and the philosophers, alone capable of correct, deomonstrative reasoning. In his Decisive Treatise Averroes argues that only the latter are capable of Ia'wll, and that the theologians have spread discontent and sectarianism among the masses by suggesting the idea that scripture might not be taken literally. The reason why we have received a Scripture with both an apparent and inner meaning lies in the diversity of people's natural capacities and the difference of their innate dispositions with regard to assent. The reason we have received in Scripture texts whose apparent meanings contradict each other is in order to draw the attention of those who are well grounded in scirence to the interpretation whicli reconciles them... ..... There are... apparent texts which have to be interpreted allegorically by men of the demonstrative class; for such men to take them in their apparent meaning is unbelief, while for those who are not of the demonstrative class to interpret them 56</page><page sequence="31">SYMBOL AND SINCERITY IN ISLAM allegorically and take them out of their apparent meaning is unbelief or heresy on their part... It was due to allegorical interpretations - especially the false ones - and the supposition that such interpretations of Scripture ought to be expressed to everyone, that the sects of Islam arose, with the result that each one accused the others of unbelief or heresy. Thus the Mu'tazilites interpreted many verses and Traditions allegorically, and expressed their interpretations to the masses, and the Ash'arites did the same, although they used such interpretations less frequently. In consequence they threw people into hatred, mutual detestation, and wars, tore the Scriptures to shreds, and completely divided people (1). Even stronger sentiments on the harm done by the theologians' discussing subtle questions with the masses are given in a passage of Averroes' Incoherence of the Incoherence, the philosophic counterattack on Ghaz5li, part of which notes, (But when the wicked and ignorant trangress and bring poison to the man for whom it is really poison, as if it were nourishment, then there is need of a physician who through his science will exert himself to heal that man, and for this reason we have allowed ourselves to discuss this problem in such a book as this, and in any other case we should not regard this as permissible to us; on the con- trary, it would be one of the greatest crimes, or a deed of the greatest wickedness on earth... , (2). In all of this, Averroes was building on the common philoso- phical tradition of Farabl and Avicenna, who voice similar sentiments in books similarly aimed at the elite. Thus Avicenna, among several such references, says of the relation of a prophet to the masses: It is not necessary for him to trouble their minds with any part of the knowledge of God, save the knowledge that He is One, True, and has no like; as for going beyond this doctrine, so as to charge them to believe in God's existence as not to be (1) Averroes, Harmony, pp. 51, 59, 68. The philosophers' restriction of philo- sophical truth to an elite is discussed in several parts of this short work, and in G. Hourani's introduction and notes. The words and ideas of Ghazali favoring the restriction of the full truth are so similar to those of the philosophers that it is clear that both were drawing on the same Greek and Islamic elitist traditions. Ghazali and the philosophers accused each other of an identical crime - misleading the people by suggesting doubts to those who should take scripture literally. (2) Averroes' Tahaful al-Tahaful, tr.

KEDDIE defined spatially or verbally divisible, as being neither without the world nor within it, or anything of that sort - to do this would impose a great strain upon them and would confuse the religious system which they follow already, bringing them to a pass wherefrom only those rare souls can escape who enjoy especial favour, and they exceedingly uncommon. The generality of mankind cannot imagine these things as they really are except by hard toil; few indeed are they who can conceive the truth of this Divine Unity and Sublimity. The rest are soon apt to disbelieve in this sort of Being, or they fall down upon the road and go off into discussions and speculations which prevent them from attending to their bodily acts, and often enough cause them to fall into opinions contrary to the good of society and inconsistent with the requirements of truth. In such circum- stances their doubts and difficulties would multiply, and it would be hard indeed by words to control them : not every man is ready to understand metaphysics, and in any case it would not be proper for any man to disclose that he is in possession of a truth which he conceals from the masses; indeed, he must not allow himself so much as to hint at any such thing. His duty is to teach men to know the Majesty and Might of God by means of symbols and parables drawn from things which they regard as mighty and majestic, imparting to them simply this much, that God has no equal, no like and no partner. Similarly he must establish in them the belief in an afterlife, in a manner that comes within the range of their imagination and will be satisfying to their souls; he will liken the happiness and misery there to be experienced in terms which they can understand and conceive. As for the truth of these matters, he will only adumbrate it to them very briefly, saying that it is something which (( eye hath not seen nor ear heard ), ... There is therefore no harm in his discourse being interspersed with sundry hints and allusions, to attract those naturally qualified for speculation to undertake philosophical research... (1).

A complement to the above notions is the idea that the initiated into a particular system form an (( elite ) to whom alone the system can be revea- led, and that the majority of Muslims form a misled and unenlightened mass. The terms and their aristocratic conno- tations have been noted among the educated orthodox, but it is (1) Avicenna on Theology, tr. A. J. Arberry (London, 1951), pp. 44-45.</page><page sequence="33">SYMBOL AND SINCERITY IN ISLAM among the heterodox that they become rigidly schematized. A natural reaction to enforced secrecy and dissimulation was a rationalization which presented the majority of the Muslims as, at least for the present, too misled and unenlightened to appre- ciate higher truths. Initiation into the Isma'ilis and into some other sects and Sifi orders involved an oath not to reveal the higher teachings to outsiders, and this originally precautionary idea was interpreted increasingly in an elitist sense. The philo- sophers restricted the elite the most, and had no hope of bringing the masses up to elite status, as the other groups might. Literalist religion and its strict laws were considered ideal, although not rational or always even true, for the permanently inferior masses. Certain lesser esoteric concepts are also found running through some representatives of all three groups, and these again spill over into orthodox or majority views, particularly with the spread and taming of Sufism. The scheme of correspondences between this world and higher ones plays a large role in such esoterism, although most of these ideas were introduced in some form even before their whole Neo-Platonic rationale was worked out. This was the case with letter and number cabbal- ism, mentioned first in relation to one of the early extremist sects, becoming of major importance with Isma'ilism, .ufism and its poetry, found in Avicenna, and spilling over into litera- ture and popular religion generally. Letters were considered to have a mysterious significance, sometimes numerical, and sometimes also as symbolizing parts of man or of the cosmos. The idea seems to have had wide popular appeal in many reli- gions, both with and without gnostic or Neo-Platonic rational- izations. There developed a special philosophic or mystic alphabet, differing in order from the ordinary one, and one important sect, the Hurifis, who influenced the Bektashi Sifi order in the Ottoman Empire (huriuf = (letters )) made such cabbalism central to its system. Somewhat related is the idea of a special, mysterious language, which appears in various groups and guises (1).

On Bektashi doctrine see John Kingsley Birge, The Beklashi Order 59</page><page sequence="34">NIKKI R. KEDDIE Another widespread esoteric notion is the Insdn al-Kamil, the ( perfect man ), or microcosm, who repeats the rhythms of the cosmos, has all knowledge, and is the mediator between this plane and higher ones. The Shi'a might identify him with the Imam, and the Sufis with their various leaders. Similar, but even more to be hidden, were incarnationist and deification notions, which are constantly reappearing among the Suifis and Shi'a, despite frequent attempts to deny them or keep them hidden. The Neo-Platonic scheme supposes that there is a real higher world with angels and archangels. Some Sufis assumed that true visions of this world, if not of God himself, can be attained through Suifi discipline and practices, while the Isma'ilis and Neo-Platonic philosophers thought that comprehension of it, and possibly also visions, could be attained mainly through understanding. The whole notion of a amore real)) world outside this one obviously leads to special notions of truth and reality, which are presumed to lie in mysterious spheres of which the real world is only a series of contingent symbols, pointing the way to those who are open to higher truths. In a world where men are steeped in error, contingent half-truths may be necessary in the service of a higher truth. The assumption of secret essences behind external experiences underlies the whole world of alchemy, so assiduously cultivated in mediaeval Islam. The central idea of transmutation of mater- ials is based on it; here again it was assumed that beneath the apparent world of contingency there was a truer and more valuable essence. Another common feature of esoterism was heavy reliance on oral teaching, and reluctance to put the highest level of doctrine into writing. Along with this went gradual or phased initiation in some cases. The symbolism or obscurity of writings was of Dervishes (London, 1937), ch. IT-III. \'hat Birge found from personal experience among the Bektashis could probably be said of many of the more heterodox orders: The range of belief is wide, varying from the crudest superstition on the part of ignorant Bektashis up to a virtual solipsism or belief that no one exists but oneself, and even to a definitely materialistic atheism. The belief about immortality varies from a conviction that the soul on death passes into the body of an animal whose characteristics resemble the quality of one's life to a complete disbelief in anything at all after death. a (p. 87). 60</page><page sequence="35">SYMBOL AND SI&amp;CERITY IN ISLAMn partly precautionary, and such texts were considered to need special oral exegesis. The prevalence of elitism and of the need to hide heterodox beliefs in public, and the difficulty of judging Islamic figures by their external appearance can be symbolized in the experience of Averroes, whose views have already been quoted. His philosophic work, like that of Ibn Tufayl, was patronized by the Almohad court of Spain at the very same time as its princes were known for enforcing the most rigid orthodoxy among the population. Averroes' account of his first meeting with the Almohad prince has come down to us indirectly: ( The first thing that the Prince of Believers said to me, after asking me my name, my father's name and my genealogy was: 'What is their opinion about the heavens' - referring to the philosophers - 'Are they eternal or created ? ' Confusion and fear took hold of me, and I began making excuses and denying that I had ever concerned myself with philosophic learning; for I did not know what Ibn Tufayl had told him on the subject. But the Prince of Believers understood my fear and confusion, and turning to Ibn Tufayl began talking about the question of which he had asked me, mentioning what Aristotle, Plato and all the philosophers had said, and bringing in besides the objections of the Muslim thinkers against them... Thus he continued to set me at ease until I spoke,... ) ('). Here is an indication of the extreme secrecy surrounding philosophy. Averroes had no idea of the Prince's philosophical interest before this interview, and feared some penalty if he should as much as show acquaintance with the subject. The fact that Averroes was able to do as much philosophic work as he did was due largely to the fortunate circumstance of patronage by a philosophic prince, but even Averroes was later subjected to serious persecution. Thus we have seen the pervasiveness within Islamic culture after the earliest centuries of the notion that real comprehension of the truth is open only to restricted groups, and that technical untruths for praiseworthy aims are permitted toward those outside such groups, from whom higher realities should be hidden for reasons of prudence and principle. Traditions of esoterism, dissimulation, and pious invention have encouraged styles of dis- (1) Introduction to Averroes, Harmony, pp. 12-13.

KEDDIE course and writing in which thle end to be served is considered more important than the exact truth of what is said. It would seem that this important traditional ((style)) of writing and discourse in which the ends to be served often loomed larger in the mind of the author than his belief in everything which he said should be taken into account in discussions of 19th and 20th century Islamic intellectual history. Not only did modern Muslim intellectuals generally grow up in an envi- ronment where the traditions discussed above were still a living force, but there were often still strong practical reasons for disguising some of one's beliefs in public - reasons in some cases similar to those of earlier ages. The fanaticism and fundamen- talism of much of the population and of the 'ulama' enjoined dissimulation of new beliefs if one were to hope to escape perse- cution and to have influence. And the traditional Islamic reluctance to admit borrowing and desire to attribute all inno- vations, however forcedly, to the Islamic past, has been rein- forced by the fact that the latest source of borrowing, the modern West, has often been a political enemy and oppressor (1). In an effort to make modern ideas acceptable to the widest public the modernists have quite naturally adopted traditional means. New interpretations of the Qur'an and of the life and sayings of the Prophet and his companions; appeals designed to move the masses through simple religious notions; delibera- tely exaggerated and often religiously oriented attacks on enemies and their motivations; the legitimizing of innovation by claiming for it Islamic parentage - these and other modernist and nationalist techniques reflect manners of thought and speech with centuries-old roots in the Islamic community. Instead of merely being critical of such distortions and exaggerations we should perhaps also recognize the traditions and compulsions which have led even men of high intellectual ability and moral sense to utilize them. If Westerners would recall Western religion before the (1) On the reluctance to admit borrowing from Western oppressors and compul- sion to make borrowed items appear indigenous see my i Western Rule versus Western Values: Suggestions for a Comparative Study of Asian Intellectual History n, Diogenes, 26 (1959), 71-96. 62</page><page sequence="37">SYMBOL AND SINCERITY IN ISLAM seventeenth century, with all its fanaticism, elitism, and physical persecution for unorthodoxy, they might admire the means by which Islam minimized physical persecution and permitted considerable diversity beneath its formal unity. The criterion of literal truthfulness as a major virtue seems inapplicable to any society in which deviation from orthodoxy involves sanctions, and traditional Islam was only one among many such cultures. This paper has not tried to indicate that Muslims have fallen short of some abstract eternal virtue, but rather that what is a virtue in one time and place may be an evil or an impossibility in another. It would seem a serious error to read the works of either traditional or modern Muslim authors as if they had been written for a homogeneous audience in a liberal, secular society. Often Western criticisms of modern Muslim thinkers seem to focus on the literal accuracy of what they say rather than on the needs and traditions which lead them to express themselves in a certain fashion. Greater awareness of these needs and traditions could lead to greater respect for the useful work performed by modern Muslim thinkers in bridging the painful gap between traditional values and modern needs.
