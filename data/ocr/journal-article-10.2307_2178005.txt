'Absolute' and 'Relative' Truth. H. H. JOACHIM. Mind, No. 53, pp. I-14. This article is an attack on the position that truth is eo ipso absolute and that a partial truth is merely an indeterminate judgment applying to only a part of the subject matter. According to this view, any part of knowl- edge remains always true without qualification though more knowledge may add to it, supplement, and fulfil it. This seems to destroy the system- atic character of knowledge, for it implies that science grows by the accre- tion of elements of truth, each absolute on its own account. The charac- ter of any single proposition is determined by the systematic whole of which it is a part. But the opponent would deny that the truth of a judg- ment must alter with its significance. The dispute here is obviously regard- ing the meaning of truth. Absolute truth is an ideal which, though in one sense apprehended, is never realized by discursive thought. In actual finite thinking the criterion of our possession of truth is always the self- coherence of a system of judgments. In this sense, truth lives and ex- presses itself only in human knowledge. A system is self-coherent in pro- portion as every constituent element involves, and is involved by, every other, and as the reciprocal implications of the elements constitute the significance of the system. It follows from this view that any mathe- matical judgment, like 2 + 2 = 4, is essentially a constituent of a system of judgments and derives whatever finality it possesses from its position in this system; its universality is a reflection of the systematic character of the whole science of arithmetic. This science, in its turn, derives its truth from its logical relations to other parts of a self-coherent human experience. The judgment of perception is the product of relatively a low level of ex- perience. It expresses truth only subject to a great mass of conditions, 738</page><page sequence="2">SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 739 unexpressed but implied. No scientific judgment remains on the perceptual plane. In a sense, the judgment of perception does possess unalterable validity, but only as an existence in the system of reality which, for the infinite subject, is timelessly actual. To identify this reality with truth in a texture of human knowledge, is a mere confusion. Science does not contain, or preserve the truth of, judgments of perception as such. If a judgment is taken up into a larger system of knowledge, it must transform itself to meet the condition of the system and cannot be taken over as an element of absolute truth. GEORGE H. SABINE. flow Two Minds Can Know One Thing. WILLIAM JAMES. J. of Ph., Psy., and Sci. Meth., II, 7, pp. I76-i8i. The terms physical and psychical are applied to a content in experience according as it figures in one or another context. Can a unit of pure ex- perience enter into and figure in two diverse streams of consciousness while remaining the same unit ? A pure experience is neither subjective nor objective; it enters consciousness only by appropriation, which is part of the content of a later experience, an experience which has past time for its content and repeats the group of feelings originally connected with the pure experience. This group of feelings is the nucleus of ' me' and the pure experience, by association with them, becomes mine. If the pure experience is to be appropriated by two streams of consciousness, it is only necessary that there be a second subsequent experience, collateral and con- temporary with the first subsequent one, in which a similar act of appro- priation may occur. Nor does this interfere with the original experience, figuring also as an object. Hence there is no logical difficulty in suppos- ing that the same experience figures in two consciousnesses. It follows from this view that an experience which has no context cannot properly be called conscious at all and, considered in itself, is absolute, for truth also is a matter of context. A pure experience can be postulated with any span; time is irrelevant. If after millions of years an experience should arise which would appropriate my present thought, this present thought would continue its function practically unchanged. In the light of this theory such speculations as Fechner's notion of an Earth-soul are in order. GEORGE H. SABINE. Radical Emntiricismn and Wuzndt's P/zilosofihy. CHARLES H. JUDD. J. of Ph., Psy., and Sci. Meth., II, 7, PP. i69-I76. It is a matter of surprise to those interested in current American discus- sions of radical empiricism that its similarity to Wundt's philosophy is not adequately appreciated by its exponents. Like James, Wundt finds the whole of reality in immediate experience, which is at once subject and ob-</page><page sequence="3">740 THE PHILOSOPHIC4L RE VVIEW. [VOL. XIV. ject, thinker and thought. Many special positions, too, in the writings of Wundt and James are strikingly alike. More interesting, however, are their differences of method. James uses the pragmatic method; a bit of pure experience is corroborated by a future experience which fulfils it. Wundt derives particular realities from the general reality of experience by reference to relatively permanent factors which become analyzed out in the course of experience. When future experience fails to corroborate my past experience, I actively reorganize my experience, filling in the gaps with such ' constructs ' as will yield a satisfactory unity. This free con- struction may extend to such ideal concepts as infinity, etc. This ' critical realism' is as empirical as James's theory, and has the advantage of rec- ognizing the existence of a creative synthesis which often determines the course of future corroboration and gives stability to present experience. James tends to gloss over distinctions which are of vital importance for life; e. g., the difference between subjective and objective space. Wundt, on the other hand, insists on these distinctions. Thus, also, James covers up the difference between objects for different persons by arguing that many persons can know the same object. Wundt, however, would admit the existence of an object only as the result of an elaborate process of ab- straction in pure experience. Nevertheless, the likenesses of the systems are more striking than their differences, and will, perhaps, become more so as Professor James makes his theory more complete. GEORGE H. SABINE. Professor James on 'IHumanism and Tru/h.' H. W. B. JOSEPH. Mind, No. 53, pp. 28-4i. This article is a criticism of Professor James's article on " Humanism and Truth," published in Mind, No. 52. The thesis that the ' truth of any statement consists in its consequences' is not clear. Apparently it does not mean that the truth of a statement may or must have practical conse- quences, for this begs the question of defining truth. A statement itself can have consequences only (I) as believed true, but this involves a dis- tinction between truth and the consequences of the statement, and (2) in the merely psychological reaction it causes. The latter theory destroys all truth. James speaks as if every conception were an hypothesis, and re- gards the fundamental categories of thought as 'purely human habits.' This explanation presupposes that orderly system of nature of which thought alone can make us aware. James seems, at times, to attempt to dispense with the notion of a 'transperceptual reality,' regarding experience as a gradual elaboration of a chaotic pure experience. The categories get their justification only from their success in dealing with pure experience and might have been entirely different from what they are. But if pure expe- rience were really chaotic, nothing could present a problem to it. A change of fundamental categories would carry with it a complete change</page><page sequence="4">No. 6.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 74I in the nature of mind. The mere fact that knowledge is beneficial does not explain in the least what it is. James does not explain the relation of his practical criterion of truth to theoretic curiosity,' the existence of which he admits and on which he bases the disinterested pursuit of truth. He holds that truth must be intellectually and practically satisfactory, but does not explain whether this constitutes two criterions or whether the two must coincide. GEORGE H. SABINE. La regularilK universelle du devenir et les lois de la nature. W. M. Koz- LOWSKI. Rev. Ph., XXX, 3, pp. 225-251. All rational thinking postulates necessity or ' the universal regularity of becoming.' Primitive minds conceive it in the form of destiny. With the development of thought, this transcendent conception is replaced by that of immanent mechanical necessity, to which is attached the corollary of the mutual interaction of all substances. The laws of nature are based upon this postulate of universal regularity, a postulate which cannot be proved by experience since it renders experience possible, forcing us to group phenomena and to establish laws. Natural law differs from destiny in that it is purely regulative and hypothetical in character, simply stating the conditions under which effects are realized. Destiny, on the other hand, rigidly forecasts the nature of approaching events. An analysis of induc- tion, the logical instrument for discovering law, confirms the view that natural laws are in reality only the external projection of the regularity which our intelligence, in following its a f5riori demands, introduces into the class of perceptions. Human thought, in every branch of science, passes through the same logical phases in arriving at the unity of law. There is an inductive period until the inner mechanism determining the particular form of regularity becomes so clear that deduction can begin. In other words, there is a transition from empirical causality, or constant succession, to rational causality, or the recognition of an identical element in cause and effect. General laws have a rationalistic, a f5riori character in that they hold only for ideal cases. They are the skeleton ideal which penetrates reality and renders it comprehensible. The genius of the savant consists in finding an ideal construction which approaches reality as closely as possible and in as many cases as possible. Theoretically, natural laws satisfy our architectonic need; practically, they submit nature to us. They differ from hypotheses in that they are the product of discursive thought while the latter are the work of the productive imagination. Both, however, arise with the same logical necessity from the interaction between given reality and our understanding. But, because natural laws arise only from our intelligence, we cannot conclude that they have no value. Granted that they do not discover reality, they still have an interest for us. In addition to their practical role, they represent a conceptual order of sensible material which leads through processes of analysis and synthesis to a philosophical conception of the world.

Meth., I, 22, pp. 595-603. That the laws of experience are the laws of our needs is evidence, not of the pragmatist's assumption that our needs create the laws, but of the organic unity of the universe. Reality is a dynamic whole, the parts of which are in reciprocal and organic unity of development. The causal relation expresses an observed uniformity in some portions of experience, of which use may be made. The only thinkable causality, however, is not that of a plurality of causes, but of the totality of fixed relations in the organic whole, in which every part implies the whole. The complex unity of things suggests alternative grounds for itself. The world may be re- garded as a self-explanatory mechanism created and set going by an infinite force, or as an organism endowed with immanent unity and power. The latter conception alone is satisfactory. Knowledge is the appreciation of changes in experience in definite relation to each other and to the perceiv- ing self. The validity of knowledge depends on the uniformity of the relation between experience and objective reality, on the completeness of experience, and on the certainty of our inferences. Since knowledge thus depends on conditions of which the complete fulfillment is impossible, it might seem to possess no validity. Relying, however, on the organic nature of the world, we must assume that cognition, however subjective and in- complete, has a uniform and valid relation to reality. Such an assumption is demanded both by science and practical life. MARY WINIFRED SPRAGUE. PSYCHOLOGY. Notes on a Case of Successful Otieration for Congenital Cataract in an Adult. R. LATTA. Br. J. Psy., I, 2, Pp. I35-150. The patient was John Carruth, 30 years old. He grew up without edu- cation but was extremely familiar with his home surroundings. He was apt and had a good memory. His ' sense of obstacles' and hearing were wonderfully acute, and he could distinguish different blossoms partly by touch, but mainly by smell. He was proficient as a laborer, having worked as a farm hand and as a grocer's assistant. Before the operation, the eyes were small, deeply sunk, and moved continuously. He could tell night from day, but could not distinguish objects. For about ten days after the operation the patient was dazed and could not realize that he was seeing. Things seemed much too large to the new sense and he could not interpret them. He learned red from a red blanket and had to be told but once. He learned yellow from a certain yellow flower which he recognized by the smell and knew it must be yellow. But he had no smell-association for green; hence it was hardest for him to learn. As for the perception of form, when asked to distinguish betwiecn a ball and a toy brick, he looked</page><page sequence="6">No. 6.] SUMMA4RIES OF ARTICLES. 743 at them attentively for a considerable time, his hands moving nervously, as if he were trying to translate what he saw by comparing it with an imagi- nary tactile impression, then named them both correctly. He also identi- fied an arch. He did not piece things together from a separate study of parts, but went on looking until he found something which suggested the whole. He could very soon guide himself with ease, on the level, through doorways; but had some difficulty in ascending stairs because the steps seemed too high and he raised his feet much higher than necessary. He did not retain his faculty of moving about easily in the dark. In looking at two buildings, one of which was more remote than the other, he was surprised to notice that one seemed smaller and dimmer than the other; and could not readily distinguish fore-ground and back-ground in a picture. It was some time before he gained visual images and associations; he was finally able, however, to visualize such things as stars, gold fish, clocks, etc., -things that interested and impressed him on first seeing them. He dreams more frequently since he sees, and the dreams are mainly visual. The noteworthy thing in this case, is the patient's ease and rapidity in in- ference and in accommodating himself to his new circumstances, probably due to his previous training, both cognitive and conative, for he is just the opposite of his sister who was also operated on for the same disease but who was very timid and retiring before the operation. She has never been able to overcome this tendency. She was delighted with the ability to see, but preferred to rely on the sense of touch for information. These observations make it clear that the experiences of an adult restored to sight are different from those of a child. J. H. COFFIN. Fresh Light on Molyneux' Problem: Dr. Ramsay's Case. T. K. ABBOTT, Mind, No. 52, pp. 543-554. Molyneux stated his problem: "Suppose a man born blind and now adult and taught by his touch to distinguish between a cube and a sphere (suppose) of ivory and nighly of the same bigness, so as to tell, when he felt the one and the other, which is the cube and which the sphere. Sup- pose then the cube and sphere placed on a table, and the blind man made to see ; query, whether by his sight alone, before he touched them, he could now distinguish, and tell, which is the globe, which the cube." Molyneux himself, Locke, and Berkeley answered in the negative. But observation of instances in which the conditions have been fulfilled do not uphold this speculative decision. Among the older cases in point, one was a seventeen-year-old boy, who, after receiving his sight pronounced a cube and sphere as square and circle respectively. He also correctly named and described the components of a figure made up of a triangle within a circle and these within a square. He was, however, unable to identify a pyramid. Another and later case was that of Carruth, upon whom Dr. Ramsay operated for cataract in 1903. Before he was operated on he could</page><page sequence="7">744 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIV. tell night from day and perceive and locate a light, but could not distinguish colors and objects. After the operation, the first thing he saw was the face of the house-surgeon, but he did not know what it was he saw until the doctor asked him to look down; the sense of hearing guided his eyes straight to the point whence the sound came, and then recalling what he knew from having felt his own face, he realized that this must be a mouth and that he was looking at a face. He was also able to name correctly a ball and toy brick (having been told that the objects were ball and brick) after some study, and said he was so accustomed to handling objects that he had come to have a notion in his mind regarding the form of things. He also confirmed the doctrine that visual apprehension of magnitude and distance is not wholly derived from tactual or locomotive associations, by being able to guide himself about on a level, immediately upon leaving his bed. He had some difficulty in ascending a stair, stepping too high; but as soon as he noticed this, he was able to estimate the height correctly. Objects always seem too large to patients of this sort, at first sight; but it is exceptional for them to say things seem to touch their eyes; and when they do, it probably indicates a painful sensation in the eye. J. H. COFFIN. Some of the Present Problems of Abnormal Psychology. MORTON PRINCE. Psych. Rev., XII, 2-3, pp. II8-143. I. Abnormal psychological phenomena may be divided into (a) disso- ciations and imperfect syntheses, under which fall cases of loss of memory, perception, motor function, alteration of character, and divisions of per- sonality; and (b) automatisms, including all expressions beyond the will and control of the individual, such as fixed ideas, hallucinations, deliriums, obsessions, impulses, tics, convulsions, seizures, and various perversions of the visceral processes. Hence the problems of abnormal psychology largely become problems of dissociation, weakened syntheses, and autom- atism ; and the finding of the laws of each will enable us to correlate them with each other, on the one hand, and with normal psychology, on the other, since dissociation and automatism are also principles of normal psy- chology; as, for example, the phenomena of absent-mindedness and sug- gestion. One of the patent truths of abnormal psychology is the fact that, while mind ordinarily is a unity, under altered conditions it may cease to be a unity and may exhibit multiple activities; e. g., the different effects that mind may have over the body, hysteria, or alterations of character. All these present problems which have yet to be solved. II. Do subconscious states habitually exist normally, or are they always either artifacts or abnormal phenomena ? There has been a strong tendency to account for a large variety of phenomena by the so-called ' subconscious thought' or ' secondary consciousness.' But the observed facts compel us to say that, while under normal conditions a greater or less number of iso-</page><page sequence="8">No. 6.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 745 lated, dissociated states do occur, there is no evidence that they become synthetized among themselves and exhibit automatism except as artifacts and in states of abstraction. None of the theories advanced for the explana- tion of the nature of dissociation are adequate, and it must be admitted that the final explanation must be in terms of the neurone; and this has yet to be accomplished. J. H. COFFIN. The Limits of Gene/ic and of Comj crative Psychology. M. W. CALKINS. Br. J. Ps., I, 3, pp. 26I-285. The common confusion of the terms 'genetic ' and 'comparative psy- chology ' is unjustifiable. Genetic psychology is a mixture of comparative, or inferential, with direct, or introspective, psychology. Its distinctive feature is not its method, but the character of its subject-matter, conscions- ness as deveioqzing. Prior to the determination of the limits and scope of genetic psychology, its logical right to existence must be examined. The difficulty as to whether there is any sense in which consciousness may be said to develop may, however, be obviated by substituting for the Humean conception of consciousness the view that it is a self, conscious of itself, of other selves, and of its ideas. With the self rather than the idea as its unit, psychical development, no less than physiological, is con- ceivable. Development in the technical sense of evolutionary biology cannot, of course, be predicated of conscious selves. Heredity and natural selection are concepts inapplicable to self-development.' The independence and self-identity of the self, and the known tendencies of human evolution, are facts incompatible respectively with the notion of transmission of characteristics, and of selection through the destruction of the weak. Only as the succession of more complex upon simpler states of a unitary consciousness may development be predicated of the psycho- logical self. Genetic psychology is, then, in the first instance, individual psychology; more especially, the study of the individual self in the process of learning. This learning consciousness is of two types. The first, or individual type, is either an associative or an analytic process. The sec- ond, or social type, the learning by imitation or opposition, yields two subtypes, according as the imitation is of contemporary or of past selves. In the latter case, genetic psychology may truly be called a racial psychology. In comparative psychology, the initial problem is to find a criterion of con- sciousness and to determine what levels of primitive life may be regarded as conscious. The ' continuity' theory maintains that life implies con- sciousness, arguing from the metaphysical difficulty of the sudden appear- ance of consciousness at any stage of orgahiic evolution, and from the two- fold analogy of the animal with the human organism, i. e., in structure and in movement. The I mechanists' deny consciousness to organisms whose actions are unvaried reflexes, basing their arguments on the law of parsi-</page><page sequence="9">746 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW, [VOL. XIV. mony and on the likeness of certain apparently purposive and conscious acts of animals with plant changes and mechanical processes. In the points wherein they differ, neither theory proves its own thesis or refutes that of. its opponent, while both agree in recognizing consciousness where there are adapted reactions. This, then, may be taken as the criterion of conscious- ness: the occurrence of varied reactions in the face of the same environ- ment, and the consequent possibility of learning (or developing) through trial and chance success. A survey of the known relevant facts shows that with this criterion of consciousness the scope of comparative psychol- ogy is as wide as animal life, all orders from infusoria up giving evidence of adaptive reactions. The problem of the nature of the consciousness of the different orders is narrower. The minimal consciousness which an animal can be proved to have is that which accompanies the trial and error type of learning. As a parallel of the trial performances preliminary to the acquisition of a successful reaction, merely a sensational and primi- tively affective consciousness of the animal's environment and of its own movements need be assumed. For the acquired reactions, imagination on the part of the animals who learn to perform them is necessary. The next problem arising is: Do animals learn also by analytical reasoning; i. e., do they have a relational as well as a sensational consciousness ? The proof of their incapacity for abstract analysis is twofold: first, fre- quent lack of the permanence characteristic of analytic consciousness in the learning of successful reactions ; second, the slowness of advance of learn- ing. The next disputed question is: Do animals learn by the second sort of learning-consciousness ; i. e., do they possess the social consciousness involved in reflective imitation and opposition ? While the position that animals are incapable of any sort of self-consciousness is untenable, it is not yet proved that any animals have attained the explicit self-conscious- ness here involved. In child psychology, the comparative method alone is applicable in infancy ; later the child's own introspections may supple- ment the study of its thoughts, imitations, and self-assertive oppositions. ELSIE MURRAY. ETHICS AND ?STHETICS. OUer die Met/ode der reunstth/iosotkie. K. LANGE. Z. f. Psych. u. Phys., XXXVI, 5 u. 6, PP. 381-4i6. Two recent applications of the deductive method in the philosophy or art are to be found in the writings of Tolstoi and the Finnish aesthetician K. S. Laurila. Tolstoi in Was ist Kunst? declares decisively against the empirical method, reverses the fundamentalyprinciple of empirical aesthet- ics that artistic norms are not to be arbitrarily established, but must be de- rived from the works of the great masters, and maintains that 'feeling- infection' should be the criterion of art. Laurila, developing Tolstoi's concept of feeling-infection, and decrying Lange' s application of the</page><page sequence="10">No. 6.] SUMMA4RIES OF ARTICLES. 747 method of abstraction to the definition of art, makes the ' internal ideal ' his guiding principle. The conclusions reached by these two writers indi- cate the possibilities of the method. Tolstoi finds that the religious sig- nificance of the feeling presented determines the value of an art product, and declares invalid the claims of the recognized classics. Laurila, pro- ceeding likewise from an extra-artistic and ethical requirement, is forced by definition to exclude two important branches, architecture and decora- tion, from the category of art. The counter procedure proposed by Lange is purely empirical, induction from as wide a range of facts as possible. Believing that to identify the beautiful in art and nature is to fail in justice to a most important factor in art, the personality of the artist, Lange iso- lates the artistic for discussion. An appeal being made to linguistic usage in order to determine as liberally as possible the material to be used on a basis of definition, painting, sculpture, poetry, music, drama, dancing, architecture, and decoration are found among the commonly accepted arts. The element common to the products of these arts will represent the essential characteristic of the artistic; it will, moreover, be correlated with the welfare of the race, not in the narrowly ethical fashion suggested by Tolstoi and Laurila, but as in some way furthering the development of the faculties necessary to men in the struggle for existence. This common factor, determined by the purely logical process of abstraction, is found to be, not ' feeling-infection,' but ' feeling-illusion' or ' conscious self-decep- tion.' The systematic psychological analysis and description of this factor is next in order. In the observation of Laurila, it consists in the simul- taneous experiencing of two mental series, the one relating to the content of the art product, the other to the personality of the artist. In order to become established as a norm, this observation must be supported by the concurrent judgments of an overwhelming majority of connoisseurs. For this purpose, psychology has devised the aesthetic experiment, but its value is doubtful. The number of observers ordinarily employed is too small, the complexity of the art-consciousness itself too subtle for experi- mental manipulation, - objections illustrated in the recent experiments of KUlpe. The ' method of art-history' is, therefore, to be preferred, i. e., generalization from the works and opinions of the great artists and con- noisseurs of the past. In so doing, one employs the evidence, not only of the most highly qualified of all observers, the great artists themselves, but also of the thousands whose voices have gone to make up the judg- ment of history upon the classics. Volkelt's objection that this method is valueless for aesthetics, in that it is powerless to reveal the actual inner processes in the aesthetic consciousness of the artist and his public in the past, is based on a misconception of the relative spheres and problems of the esthetician and the historian of art. Volkelt's further arguments, in behalf of a strictly psychological procedure and the restriction of investi- gation to the modern aesthetic consciousness, implies a tacit return to a jiriori methods, and the use of an arbitrarily chosen subjective ideal as</page><page sequence="11">748 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIV. the criterion of the artistic. The results of the method of abstraction from historical evidence, e. g., from classical aims and ideals, the opinions of Leonardo, Dilrer, etc., confirm Lange's assumption that in illusion lies the essence of art. Further, the dual nature of the artistic consciousness is indirectly supported by the parallel concern of the great artists and critics for the natural and the beautiful, the one representative of content, the other of the selective activity of the artist. Lastly, introspection and generalization must be supplemented by investigation from the genetic standpoint,- a method unjustly depreciated by Laurila and Volkelt. The fact that the art-consciousness of the child and savage differs materially from that of the cultured adult is the stronger reason for submitting both stages of development to investigation. If in the pleasure of the former curiosity, moral approval and disapproval of content, and religious motives play the important role, in the latter disinterested enjoyment of Esthetic form is dominant. The true artistic goal lies probably between the two extremes: the 'conscious self-deception ' resulting from a perfect balance of the two mental series relating respectively to content and to artistic per- sonality is the norm indicated. Only by the combination of methods and the range of data above indicated can the laws of aesthetics be brought to approach the universal validity which Volkelt himself recognizes as their goal. E. MURRAY. Re'a/isme et idealine dans 1'art. J. PE'REis. Rev. Ph., XXX, 4, pp. 378-396. Realism assigns to the fine arts the imitation of the real. The imitation of nature depends on an effort to penetrate sympathetically into the nature of the various objects man uses. Primitive man drew pictures of the ani- mals he hunted and the implements he used, expecting the representations to conduce in some magical way to the realization of his desires. By his insight man humanizes nature and shapes it to his needs; this is the start- ing-point of idealism, which is creative rather than imitative. With this creation first emerges the distinction between the beautiful and the ugly. To beautify nature is to humanize and civilize it; only later, by way of contrast and even of protest, does wild nature come to be appreciated. Man aims to develop himself as well as nature. Thus in life and in art realism and idealism appear as two opposing tendencies, but constantly combining and reacting on each other. An essentially human purposive- ness is characteristic of idealism. The relative predominance of realism and idealism depends on historical, climatic, and social conditions. Ideal- ism, especially in classical periods, has an affinity for a monarchical or aris- tocratic form of government, as in Latin Europe during the seventeenth century; on the other hand, there is a certain affinity between realism and democratic conditions, as in the art of the Low Countries, where, however,</page><page sequence="12">No. 6.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 749 climate also had its influence. Idealism inclines to look for beauty in the human, the typical, the historical; realism, in things,-in color, light and shade, a certain ' sensuality of the eye.' Idealism in recent art seems to aim at suggesting, unobtrusively and indirectly, a higher moral order of things. The modern realistic tendency takes the forms of impressionism, an interest in historical detail, and local color. Extreme realism results in a direct comprehension of the object which makes the intervention of art superfluous; idealism, by virtue of its human element, can better sustain comparison with the real. But realism has also the more positive function of spreading the knowledge of art more generally among men and cor- recting a tendency to undue abstraction. Realism and idealism come to- gether in the desire for a 'return to nature.' Idealism, as reacted on by realism, can no longer remain so exclusively anthropomorphic as in the past; it must take account of the increasing community of man with man and with nature. F. D. MITCHELL. Essai de sociologie mnicrobienne et celiulaire. M. CHAMPEAUX. Rev. Ph., XXX, 4, PP. 367-377. This paper aims to point out the close connection between moral laws and the biological laws which operate even in the lowest stages of evolu- tion. Division of the individual by fission into two new individuals is the first example of personal sacrifice in the interests of the race. In the rela- tions of micro-organisms to the higher animals, we find mutuality of inter- est, simple tolerance of the lower by the higher, or conflict, in which, how- ever, the lower species by its very attack awakens and perfects the powers of resistance of the higher species, developing in the blood of the latter an antitoxin which enables it to resist further attacks. In multicellular organ- isms a vast number of cells function cooperatively for the good, not only of the individual as a whole, but of the species. Egoism and altruism, in- stead of being unalterably opposed, are both included in the larger indi- viduality. We inherit not only the characteristics of the species, but family traits as well; here we have the natural basis of the family. Family mo- rality is based on natural morality, conducing as it does to the better pro- tection and education of the young.

He then classifies the subsequent movements as follows I. Ontological Period: i. Naive ontologism; 2. The Sophists and methodical ontologism. II. Eudxemonological Period: I. Pyrrhonic Scepticism, Epicurus, the Stoa; 2. Scepticism of Carneades and the Philosophy of Compromise; 3. Scepticism of Alnesidemus, the philoso- phy of revelation, and positivism. W. A. H. Paul Tannery, historien de lahlzilosoyihie. FRANCOIS PICAVET. A. f. G. Ph., XVIII, 3, pp. 293-302. M. Picavet's article furnishes a summary of the contributions of the late Paul Tannery (t Nov. 27, I904) to the history of philosophy. M. Tannery was born in I843. For five years he occupied the chair of Greek and Roman Philosophy in the College de France, gave public lectures in the Faculty of Sciences on the history of ancient arithmetic, in i900 presided over the 5th section (History of Science) in the International Congress at Paris, and at the time of his death was director of a branch of government manufacture. He was a frequent contributor to the Archiv four die Ge- schichie der Philoso.5,hie, Revue PhilosoShhique, Revue de Metahhysique et de Morale, Revue de Philologie, Revue Arche'ologique, Revue Critique, Bulletin des Sciences Matheminaiques, Journal des Savants, Zeitschrijt fuir Mathematik fiund Physik, and to many other journals, as well as to the chief encyclopedias. M. Charles Adam, co-editor with him of the edition of Descartes, singles out as his characteristic qualities " high scientific probity" and an " impeccable conscience." He was regarded as one of the most erudite and original men of France, a Hellenist and critical his- torian of science and philosophy of the highest order. His most important works concerned the history of ancient science, on the one hand, and the thought of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, on the other. To the former belong the works : Pour la science hellne (i887), La geonmetrie grecque (i887), Histoire de lastronoinie ancienne (I893). To the latter belong the writings on Giordano Bruno, Malebranche, Gassendi, Bacon, Leibniz, Galileo, the edition of the works of Fermat (3 vols., i891-96), and the correspondence of Descartes. W. A. H. Zur Geschichte des Briefwechsels swischen Leibniz und Malebranche. BUCHENAU. A. f. G. Ph., XVIII, 3, PP. 3I5-32I. Gerhardt's edition of Leibniz's philosophical writings contains in the first volume (pp. 3I5 ff.) the correspondence between Leibniz and Male- branche. There are sixteen letters printed by Gerhardt, ten from Leibniz and six from Malebranche. These coincide with the letters published by Cousin in the Journal des Savants (i844) and in the Fragmnents de t5hilo- sofihie cartesienne (i845).

W. A. H. Voltaire a/s PA//osofih. P. SAKMANIN. A. f. G. Ph., XVIII, 2, pp. i 66- 2 I 5; 3, pp. 323-368. The difficulty in discussing the philosophy of Voltaire is in reducing to systematic statement the immense mass of scattered utterances of a versatile and prolific journalist and in reconciling varying utterances that are the products of varying moods. Voltaire's conception of philosophy is that of a practical political party program, the party program of the encyclopedists. He begins with a positivistic penchant and a prejudice against speculative metaphysics. His motto is: "No step without the compass of mathe- matics and the torch of experience and physics." Sakmann discusses Voltaire's philosophical views under the rubrics of epistemology, cosmol- ogy, the idea of God, nature of the soul, and the problem of freedom. (I) Epistemology: In the main Voltaire is, in his epistemology, an empiri- cist and pupil of Locke, though not a consistent pupil. For Locke' s experi- ence (sensation or reflection) he posits sensation alone, and lays greater emphasis on the passivity of human intelligence. He adds to Locke's psychology by the differentiation of productive and reproductive imagina- tion, the discussion of instinct, and accepts the Lockeian nominalism. (2) Cosmology: Naive realism is Voltaire's fundamental view of reality. The reality of the external world is more certain than many mathematical truths. He conceives the world from the standpoint of mechanism, rejects the prima materia of Descartes, and adopts the theory of atoms and empty space. A materialistic mechanism is, however, not possible, in his opinion; for pure materialism is wrecked by the evidence of intelligence in the world-structure. The impossibility of eliminating order from the natural and moral worlds (for Voltaire sees the world as cosmos) is one of his chief objections to the Sys/'me de /a nature. (3) The idea of God : Voltaire em- ploys four arguments in defence of the existence of God: (a) the teleological, (b) the hedonic, (c) the social-pedagogical, (d) the cosmological. (4) Nature of the soul: There is no such thing as an immaterial substance, a soul substance. The psychical is a quality or a function. "The soul is noth- ing but a continuous series of ideas and feelings that succeed each other and</page><page sequence="15">752 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL.

W. A. H. Herder und Tetens. XV. UBELE. A. f. G. Ph., XVIII, 2, pp. 2i6-249. This article is concerned mainly with the theory of the origin of lan- guage. In I754 Maupertuis presented a paper to the Berlin Academy on the question of a universal language and the origin of human speech, explaining the latter in terms of natural sounds and convention. In 1756 Stissmilch opposed Maupertuis in the Academy by a paper advocating a supernatural origin of language. In 1769 the Academy offered a prize for a work on this subject, which called forth thirty-one essays, amongst which was Herder's treatise with the inscription Vocabula sunt note reruin, to which the prize was awarded, and in 1772 it was printed by the Academy's order. Herder approaches the subject from the standpoint of human vs. animal psychology, eliminating the interjectional theory of the origin of words. He begins with the relation of thought to speech. Rational thought discovers characteristic marks; language invents (against the super- naturalism of SUssmilch) audible signs for such marks; thought is internal speech, language is externalized, vocalized thought, the invention of signs by means of psychophysical mechanism. Tetens' s work Uber den Ursf rung der Sfjrachen und Schrz~jf was published at Biitzow in 1772. He gives the sense and feeling nature of man a prominent place in his theory, which nature is the presupposition both of language and thought. An interjec- tional language (Condillac) is possible without reason, although reason con- verts the animal sound to a human word. In its initial stage language is a reproductive, imitative, picture system, entirely sensible, consisting of root-words. Tetens adopts an onomatopoetic theory of speech. The characters of things pass through the senses and feelings of the individual into the muscles of the vocal organs. Herder is Leibnizian in rejecting here supernaturalism, all theory that regards the origin of language devt, in positing the reason as the organ of language and language as the ancilla of reason, in regarding object-language as specifically human, in the primi- tive sensible significance of words, and in the ultimate derivation of lan- guage from a few roots. W. A. H. La notion de hasard chez Cournot. GABRIEL TARDE. Rev. de Ph., IV, II, PP. 497-5I5. For Cournot events produced by the combinations of other events belonging to independent causal series are fortuitous. The highest degree of improbability is physical impossibility. So chance depends upon probability. This theory is intimately connected with his theory of the reason of things. Philosophical speculation consists not in seeking the</page><page sequence="16">No. 6.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 753 cause but the reason of things. We must not confound the reason with the cause or with the logic of events. ' Reciprocal causality' is a misnomer, but one phenomenon may be the reason of another and vice versa. The difference, however, between the reason and logic of events is not so great as Cournot supposes. The reason of things is their explanation, the dis- covery of their relation. But there is always more than one reason of things; there is no special relation between them which can be called ration- ality. Modern social science too often emphasizes one aspect or reason, to the exclusion of others. More important, however, are Cournot's ideas on chance as the basis of mathematical and philosophical probability. He has seen that in both theoretical and practical judgments probability is the rule, certainty the exception. M. Pieron, in criticism, says this definition of chance is too broad, for most phenomena are the result of the meeting of independent series; he calls events fortuitous only when they are either contrary to our desires, or unexpectedly favorable to them. That is, the idea of finality is essential to fortuitous events. Cournot, however, tries to rule out all such subjective finality from his idea of chance. Cournot also claims that the encounter of two absolutely independent series is very rare; many series seem independent, but are really not so. Further, inde- pendent series by accumulation may become dependent. He does not admit, however, that chance means our ignorance of the true causes; a superior intelligence would be less deceived than man, but even for it chance would exist. Now we cannot define the fortuitous as the unforeseeable, because a very probable event might be unforeseeable simply because it is suigeneris. All individuality would thus be accidental. If, however, we define the fortuitous as the improbable, we avoid these difficulties. The degree of accidentality increases inversely as the degree of probability; e. g., a lottery. We are astonished, however, if, when two ships make the same voyage at sea, they collide the first time rather than on the thousandth voyage; or, if a number is drawn in a lottery twice in succession, what surprises us here is ' the involuntary imitating the voluntary.' But Cournot goes too far in saying that some series are wholly independent. As a matter of fact, independence of series is merely a relative term, admit- ting of an infinity of degrees. Postulating the metaphysical principle that all the possible tends to realize itself, we may say that all the causal series which issue in the successively realized possibles are interrelated to a greater or less extent.
