<plain_text><page sequence="1">Satan: From Toad to Atlas Ann Gossman In Paradise Lost Milton combines two treatments of evil, the classical and the medieval; the synthesis of these two traditions reflects the tension between these two apparently irreconcilable views. Those readers, diminished in number nowadays, who would make Satan the hero of the poem find most support for such a thesis in the first two books and only minimal evidence in the later books. If they would contend that Milton was "of the devil's party" whether he knew it or not, they must explain why Milton blackens their hero. On the other hand, com mitted Christian readers such as C. S. Lewis refuse even at the beginning to be taken in by Satan and rejoice that, for all his heroics, he is last seen in ser pent shape writhing on the floor of hell.1 Such readers may be giving the devil less than his due. The greatest discrepancy between the heroic and the farcical views of Satan occurs in the fourth book. There, Satan stoops low —he is found squat like a toad at the ear of Eve —but is left free to "ride with darkness" and be splendidly plausible in the ninth book. For if Satan were wholly contemptible, how could he be the Adversary of God and Man? As Adam warns Eve, Suttle he needs must be, who could seduce Angels . . . (IX, 307-8)2 The apparent contradictions about Satan that run through the poem are resolved by Milton's bril liant synthesis of the classical view of evil with the medieval Christian one. And even the latter has to come to terms with an apparent dualism acceptable to Homer's audience in a way not acceptable to the Christian. Even a Christian may admit the psycho logical truth of a certain sort of dualism: "If my devils are to leave me," Rilke said, "I am afraid that my angels will take flight also."3 Homer could fall back on a useful dichotomy:4 There are two urns that stand on the door sill of Zeus. They are unlike For the gifts they bestow, an urn of evils, an urn of blessings. But when Zeus bestows from the urn of sorrows he makes a failure of man, and the evil hunger drives him over the shining earth, and he wanders respected of neither gods nor mortals. It is easy to understand two urns, rather than one box or jar of Pandora's, and two balances for weighing the worth of souls. Yet Achilles is speaking less about evil than about misfortune, and he deliberately invokes determinism when it would be almost un bearable to sort out human responsibility. (In the Odyssey, though, Zeus complains that mortals al ways blame the gods, whereas the mortals them selves are also to blame.5) Perhaps the completely</page><page sequence="2">8 MILTON QUARTERLY accursed man of whom Achilles speaks does occur in Greek mythology, but he is more familiar in the Judaeo-Christian tradition as Cain or the Wandering Jew. There are no villains in The Iliad. Achilles would almost eat his enemy's heart in the marketplace, but at the end his savagery gives way to reasonable com passion toward Priam, whom he consoles with the speech about the urns of Zeus. Of all the Greek soldiers, Thersites, chronic com plainer, is the basest and most negative, but he lacks the magnitude to be a villain, and we hear of him only once. Of all the Homeric heroes, Agamemnon is harshest, a proud deluded man who can forbid his brother to spare a suppliant, but even he has the support of Odysseus and Nestor, and he can be truly magnanimous on occasion. He is, in short, no better and no worse than Zeus, who shows a father's grief for Sarpedon and for Troy, but who dooms them both. Hector frequently rebukes Paris for being cowardly, indifferent to his comrades' suffering, and the bane of Troy, but Paris disarms adverse critics: he is charming and amiably turns aside his brother's wrath; he is not so much cowardly as imperfectly committed to fighting; and, just as Helen is the fatal woman, Paris is the "fatal man" whose sins are dis proportionately trivial compared with their conse quences. From the standpoint of courage, Hector fails once in running from Achilles, but he is noble in most of his life and noble in death. Unlike the Greek heroes, whose entire education seemed to pre pare them for an egotistical standard of achievement in battle, Hector learns after the arrival of the Greeks to be valiant. Infinitely subtler cosmic speculation is possible for the three major writers of Greek tragedy than was available to Homer. Aeschylus illuminates the com plexity of moral choice, first in Agamemnon's de cision to sacrifice Iphigenia and later in Orestes' choice between his duties to his father and to his mother. No "right" choice is possible for either; each has the sanction of an oracle or deity; neither chooses entirely freely. Yet Aeschylus frees both men from the excessive determinism of Homer. Agamemnon leaves Calchas' words largely unexamined and chooses the worse alternative, but the one he really wants. Orestes obeys Apollo's command unwillingly, but is mature enough to say afterwards that he has never complained of this circumstance. Yet cosmic justice does evolve, or our idea of it does. Even the malign Zeus of the Prometheus Bound can presum ably change for the better, for in the Oresteia he has emerged as the third savior.6 And Zeus's law re deems even suffering by making it the means to wis dom. Sophocles gives us no Olympian gods who are not ambivalent, or another name for impersonal cosmic law, or both. Few villains appear in the works of either Aeschylus or Sophocles. Despite his pride, Agamemnon is a great leader for whom the whole community mourns. Even Clytemnestra is partly right in supposing herself the instrument of fate and partly justified in killing Agamemnon, although her murder of Cassandra is a purely gratuitious act of evil. The Apollo of Oedipus Rex and the Athena of Ajax appear to be malign deities, but the curse of each is somehow an ultimate blessing. Euripides comes closer than either Aeschylus or Sophocles to separating good and evil in the cosmos. "God, if he exists, must be perfect," and the myths of imperfect deity are "but the wretched lies of poets."7 Yet Hera sends Madness to drive the good Heracles to slaughter his wife and children. Euri pides is exposing the gods deified by his people: if they are conceived of in anthropomorphic terms, like the Aphrodite of Hippolytus, theirs is unmitigated cruelty. Otherwise they are good, but powerless, like Artemis, or amoral, like Dionysus, or perhaps like Nature herself. Only one of Euripides's major char acters is demonstrably "evil," the passionate and moving Medea, who inflicts suffering on everyone, including herself. What terrifies us about Medea is that she seems to have her own logic of passion, and she elicits a share of sympathy before we are chilled past feeling for her. If at times Euripides could free "god" or "the gods" from the ambivalent role of Zeus with his urns, if he could envision a god who was perfectly good, he nevertheless saw the cosmos divided by an amoral force, such as chance, which caused discontinuity and shattered any human hope of order. Any goodness that may exist outside man's own efforts was divorced from power. The medieval Christian view, on the other hand, could not separate God's goodness from His power, nor could it postulate any dualism save a moral one.8 Its dichotomy had to be based on a shift of perspective from that of God in eternity to that of man in time. God, who is absolutely good, is the source of all reality, and evil is naught. Yet creatures are left free to turn from Him, and in that turning away, evil resides. Lucifer, as Dante depicts him, is ultimately frozen and static. Separate from warmth, light, beauty, and love, he is grotesque. Other sinners wallow in muck, writhe in pitch, split into pieces, turn into snakes, break out into sores, or burn with a hard, gemlike flame—all because they are allowed</page><page sequence="3">MILTON QUARTERLY 9 to "be themselves" apart from God. That is sin. Since no reasonable person could want that, all of the sinners must have imagined all manner of desirable properties in the sins that they embraced. Some of the damned souls in Dante's Inferno reveal their illusions, Francesca is still in love with the glamor of her sin. But Dante does not focus on temptation. How could he, when he shows us souls finally committed, not in the process of making their commitments? For the process of crucial choice, we must turn rather to the morality plays, where anyone would gladly follow Gluttony to the tavern if he is as lovable a companion as Falstaff. What does humanity want, if not some variation of what Satan offered Adam and Eve or what he tried to offer Jesus in the wilderness —to be as gods, to possess the king doms of the world, magically to satisfy any hunger or defy any limits or law. In most of medieval and Renaissance literature, the lures are variations of these crucial Biblical scenes of temptation. Two extra meanings, apart from man's desire to be as gods, accrued in the Middle Ages to the story of the forbidden fruit. One of these was forbidden knowledge of any kind, not just the knowledge of good and evil from experience. Such knowledge often takes the form of magic power, as illustrated in the Tragical History of Dr. Faustus. The other meaning is man's carnal knowledge of woman. Enter the glamorous temptress, even though she may really turn out to be the Loathly Lady. Bercilak's wife in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight first appears with the loathly lady, perhaps as one of the two faces of Fortune.9 She provides part of the trial of Sir Gawain, but she is in turn an instrument of Morgan le Fay. It might seem that such temptresses would owe something to Circe, but if so, it is to the medieval allegorizations of Ovid's Circe. For Circe is not simply Lust in Homer's version. She has one bad habit, that of treating men as something less than human, but once Odysseus breaks her of that, he spends an entirely happy year with her, just as he copes with various other people who are a mixture of good and evil. One might expect from the classical citations in the letter to Ralegh that Spenser might impart a slightly classical treatment of evil to some of the witches, giants, and ogres of Faerie Land, but he does not.10 Evil is either as ugly and grotesque as it "really is," or it is glamorously deceptive. Various knights must cope with Lucifera, Duessa, Malecasta, Acrasia, Munera, Philotime, and other temptresses. The lady does not always symbolize lust, but may variously be greed, pride, ambition, the false church, or even Mutability, a beautiful Titaness who claims to rule the cosmos. Some of these ladies are resisted and others are unmasked. Occasionally a cruel fair one (Mirabella, Poena, Briana) will mend her ways. The chivalric metaphor enables Spenser to pit his good knights against various male personifications of sin in its essential ugliness, e.g., Salvage Lust, the Souldan, Gerioneo, Orgoglio. Of the base male characters who counterfeit goodness, Archimago re sembles a pious hermit, and Braggadochio seems brave to the churl whose mother, a witch, created the false Florimel. None of Spenser's characters has ambivalent excellences. None so much as borrows virtues from the classical heroes, except insofar as the classical virtues of Aristotle's Ethics are reinter pretated by medieval and Renaissance Christian writers. The only Spenserian character clearly de rived from a Homeric figure is Paridell, degenerate scion of Paris, who is by no means a hero in The Iliad. Paridell is parody of chivalric excellence and courtly love. First his fine manners deteriorate, and then his morals. It is left for Milton, who shared Dante's and Spen ser's assumptions about evil, to present its apparent glamor not entirely in the medieval or Spenserian manner, but in a classical one. It remained also for him to stress the process of turning away from good, not the end result. His Satan is originally a good creature and does not lose all of his original bright ness. He is never annihilated, but he is finally sealed up in hell. In addition, Milton treats Satan's actions as compatible with the providential plan whereby man must confront temptation in order to make a morally valid choice. One suspects that had there not been an angel who turned away from God and sought every means to negate Him, both God and Milton would have had to invent one. The cosmos is not dualistic, but Satan's great illusion is that he can make it so, that he can hold as least "divided empire" with God, and that he can somehow create an inverse of the divine values by asserting, "Evil, be thou my good." But Satan is confused. Milton in no way contra dicts himself in the way he presents Satan, but he shows us Satan's own ambivalences about himself. At times, Satan can be good. By the time he con fronts Eve, he can be only "stupidly good." (P.L., IX, 465). In the earlier books he both counterfeits good and in some measure actually embodies it. The problem for Milton was not to create the most re</page><page sequence="4">10 MILTON QUARTERLY pulsive Satan possible, but to create one who could plausibly deceive angels and the reasonable and good "mother of Mankind." We understand her being deceived because we ourselves are almost, if not quite, deceived into admiring him. For Milton, such admiration could be elicited only by appeal to the classical tradition of heroism, though such "heroism" is always ironically qualified in contrast with the broader encompassing tradition of Christianity. In Books I and II Satan is wrong-headed, but impressive. He resembles Achilles in his "courage never to submit or yield" and Odysseus and Jason in his terrifying voyage through Chaos. Such courage pales besides the magnificent example of Christ in Book III, but Satan and Christ do not yet confront one another. Satan is diminished somewhat by being compared to a vulture, but he enjoys a delightful temporary success in deceiving the angel Uriel in an encounter that owes much more to the Odyssey than to medieval drama. Uriel is not "tempted," nor does he fall. He simply makes a generous mistake. Book IV shows us a paradise with Adam and Eve as yet unfallen, but it is framed by passages con cerning Satan. First, Milton elicits sympathy for "innocent frail man" so threatened. At this point he gives us the most serious, sublime, and even tragic revelation of Satan in the apostrophe to the sun. Satan is not the hero, because his enormous cruelty to innocent mankind inhibits us from experiencing the full measure of sympathy for him, just as Medea's use of torture and murder alienate us in Euripides' drama. Yet Satan exemplifies the archetypal tragic pattern within a Christian framework and must therefore elicit some sympathy. His is the darkest of all recognitions: no determinism apart from his own choice has doomed him in a cosmos in which there is no fate or chance to blame and no power but "Heav'n's free Love dealt equally to all" (PL IV, 68). Yet Satan is his choice, and he reaffirms it, knowing that nothing awaits him but the progressively de generating hell of self. If there is to be any transition between the Satan who suffers and the Satan who inflicts suffering, Milton must alter the perspective upon him. This he does, first by means of a series of animal images, then by means of the serious, but not tragic, speeches in which Satan plots his revenge against God. These are the dramatic revelations of a base villain moved by no passion greater than envy, to no action at this point baser than spying. Not until we see Satan "squat like a toad" and subsequently starting up like exploding gunpowder do we find an overtly comic or satiric treatment of evil. The animal images im plied a medieval treatment of evil as grotesque, yet they were formulated in terms of Homeric simile. And the thief "bent to unhoard the cash" of the rich burgher was a somewhat comic anticlimax following the comparison of Satan to a wolf. Here, though, the comedy increases when Satan's injured vanity makes him ask, "Know ye not me?" (PL IV, 828). Yet the comedy is limited, and not even the scene with Gabriel, in which Satan is taunted and exposed as a coward, a liar, and a spy, levels Satan to the ranks of Braggadochio. Braggadochio is a sham, whereas Satan has as much "courage" as Platonic and Christian tradition can concede to one lacking in wisdom and goodness. As physical bravery, it is impressive while it lasts, but it will eventually evaporate. Milton's solution is to restore Satan to his charac teristic shape and dimension as the darkened Prince of Hell. He writes the verbal duel between Satan and Gabriel in Homeric, not in medieval, terms. Satan may strike the pose of a classical hero, but Gabriel elicits the truth from him with as little difficulty as Diomedes and Odysseus had in dealing with Hector's inept spy Dolon. Gabriel taunts Satan and threatens to drag him back to hell in chains. Although Gabriel certainly could do so, the sight of God's golden scales restrains him, for God's purpose (and Milton's) would be frustrated if force were used. Yet for Satan to slink away humilated at this point would create an aesthetic imbalance that would make evil appear to be merely ignoble. Once more, Milton solves the problem of tone through imagery. Just as Milton had played off a speech reminiscent of classical tragedy against grotesque imagery earlier in the poem, so now he plays off a speech reminiscent of the grim comedy of epic against sublime imagery: on the other side Satan allarm'd Collecting all his might dilated stood, Like Teneriff or Atlas unremov'd . . . .(IV, 987) Whatever Satan's proper dimension may be, if angelic substance admits cf dimension, he can dwindle to the size of a toad or expand to the height and mass of a mountain. Even apart from the connotations of "toad," the small size of the creature seems to betoken pettiness, just as there is a correlation between phy sical magnitude and heroic grandeur. Teneriff is simply a mountain. Atlas, though also a mountain, has other associations. Milton alludes several times in Books I and II to the war between the Titan and the Olympians. In the first book he speaks of</page><page sequence="5">MILTON QUARTERLY 11 Titan, Heav'n's first born With his enormous brood . . . .(I, 510-511) And in the second book Beelzebub stands With Atlantean shoulders fit to bear The weight of mightiest Monarchies .... (II, 306-307) These earlier mentions of the war between the Titans and the Olympians and the explicit naming of Atlas cause the reader to perceive Satan both as mountain and as a Titan, "unremov'd" and presumably in capable of being removed. At this point, Satan and Gabriel both accept the sign in the sky. The duel does not take place; had it done so, Gabriel would have won, but we infer that Satan would have fought bravely before being overthrown. He is given no further nobility, nor is he shown creeping away basely. Instead, Milton shows us a Satan who is declining, but who is not simply grotesque. At the end of the encounter he fled Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night. (IV, 1015) Such a resolution is crucial. Satan's appearance as toad has foreshadowed his subsequent base descent into the serpent; his encounter with Zephon's spear has provided a motivation for his later recognition of the need to "incarnate and imbrute" much more literally; and his return to impressiveness leads to his return as Adversary in the ninth book. Thus, through imagery, Satan can continue to go from baseness to apparent grandeur to ultimate baseness; he will finally go from triumphant ruler of hell to huge python, as swiftly as here he has gone from toad to Atlas in a few short lines.
