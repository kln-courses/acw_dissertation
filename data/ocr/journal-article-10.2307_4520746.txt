In Alaska's Denali National Park in the 1990S, a large wolf and I nearly ran right into each other, before we both took off running. When I told a ranger about the encounter, he said what I had been thinking, "Cool!" Wolves may be cool now, but that has certainly not been the case for most of American history. In Vicious, Jon Cole- man asks, "Why did Americans hate wolves for hundreds of years and then begin to change their minds?" (p. 11). Answering this simple question requires a thoughtful examination of the relationship between nature, culture, folklore, and economy over a long span of time and a wide swath of the United States. Coleman convincingly argues that predator control as a means of protecting domestic animals never fully explains the intensity of hatred directed at wolves and thejoy that even nature lovers took in watch- ing or participating in their slaughter. The story of preda- tor control by ranchers and farmers and then the federal government is interesting, and Coleman tells a wonderfully nuanced history of its practices and policies. What makes the book so compelling, however, is the story of how wolf killing was woven into the fabric of American culture and folklore. These cultural connections explain why hatred of wolves was transmitted generation to generation, long after most Americans had any real reason to worry about these shy predators. The glorification of wolf killing that may seem macabre or even demented to a modern reader was once common- place, Coleman demonstrates, and this antipathy was not just the doing of ranchers defending livestock or pioneers living in the wild. Otherwise careful observers of nature perpetuated anthropomorphic folklore that painted wolves as cunning, criminal animals and enemies of civilization. While Coleman's point that wolves "push history beyond the confines of humanity to include the creatures and bio- logical processes that shaped the past" is well made, he makes another even more compelling argument as well: by looking at the creatures we hated, we can learn a great deal about human nature and American culture (p. 235). In telling the history of wolves, Coleman presents some well-known historical figures while resurrecting the works of lesser-known but important actors in environmental 68</page><page sequence="2">WINTER 2005 ' REVIEWS history. Particularly interesting is the thoughtful discus- sion of the work of biologist Stanley Young and conserva- tionist Arthur Carhart. Coleman convincingly argues that their collaboration on The Last Stand of the Pack and the public response to the book represents a turning point in American environmental thinking. Coleman unnecessarily apologizes for the focused geo- graphical trajectory of his analysis, which follows from east to west across the country. While there were wolves all over North America, Coleman's narrowing of focus enables him to concentrate on significant trends and rela- tionships. Vicious builds nicely on the work of Timothy Rawson and others who study wolves and predator con- trol in Alaska and makes a significant contribution to the effort of environmental scholars to illuminate the complex relationship between nature and culture. Thoughtfully conceived, insightful, and well written, Vicious is a wicked good read. Andrew Kirk University of Nevada-Las Vegas THE CONSTITUTION OF EMPIRE Territorial Expansion and American Legal History Gary Lawson and Guy Seidman Yale University Press, New Haven, 2004. Notes, index. vii + 272 pp. $40.00 cloth. At first blush, this is not a book for historians. It rests on a question the authors call "academic in the purest sense of the term": "Has American expansion taken place pursuant to or outside the bounds of the United States Constitu- tion?" (pp. 12, 2). The question seems unimportant because it examines a process that is complete and irreversible. No one argues today for the acquisition of additional U.S. colonies. And not even the most disgruntled Democrat wants to give Florida back to Spain. These are lawyers asking lawyers' questions that arise from the Constitution's imprecise language-and silence-regarding territorial acquisition and governance: What are the limits on territorial acquisi- tion? What does the constitution require with regard to the organization of territorial legislatures and courts? Do territorial inhabitants have constitutional rights? The second reason for historians to look askance at this enterprise is its methodology. The lawyers propose to employ an approach they call "originalist." They claim to reveal constitutional meanings at "the point in time at which the meaning of the federal Constitution is fixed" (p. 7). This meaning, they claim, "is a historical fact" that can be determined by assessing what "a fully informed public audience at the relevant point in time" would have understood (p. 9). Despite these claims, the book should not be dismissed as an exploration of meaningless ques- tions or an exercise in positivist self-congratulation. In the first half of the book, the authors' "lawyers' ques- tions" and rigid, often tedious, textual divinations produce fascinating assertions. For example, they argue treaty- making power is a delegated power and is therefore lim- ited. Treaties must further some legitimate governmental function, and they cannot subvert other parts of the Con- stitution. The authors deduce a corollary to this propo- sition: constitutionally, territory can only be acquired to further a constitutionally sanctioned act such as admitting new states or acquiring land for a military installation. The authors lay these claims alongside a brief review of U.S. territorial acquisition, from Louisiana to the Philippines. The authors' review inspires a provocative assertion: the acquisition of large overseas territories that would not become states (the Philippines, for example) is unconstitutional. This assertion prompts real historians' questions. How did this happen? What changed? Why? Were the changes evolutionary-or revolutionary? The second half of the book explores the constitu- tionality of territorial governance and produces similar Eve n Cameron turn 1894-1 ptraphedthe :[I_ changing face f:i M - horse and ciatle drives, sheep herding, the wool trade, the rilroad, and the arrival of homesteaders. :A ig 69</page></plain_text>
