<plain_text><page sequence="1">FaIl, 1981 THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN 43 PROGRAMS and ABSTRACTS FRIDAY MORNING October 23, 1981 9:30 a.m.-12:00 noon AMERICANLITERATURE II: - Literature Since 1900 - Trinity Room Chairman: Nancy Cluck, The University of Texas at Dallas Secretary: Thomas Bonner, Jr., Xavier University of Louisiana 1. "Faulkner's Secular Romanticism," Allan Chavkin, Southwest Texas State University. (20 min.) Much of Faulkner's canon can best be understood as a product of what might be called his "secular romanticism." The term refers to the sensibility of Wordsworth and Keats, who ultimately refuse to reside in supernatural realms or hellish wastelands and instead seek for earthly affirmations. While his world is fraught with decay and grotesqueness, Faulkner is a romantic in his attitudes; in his humanism, which affirms the "truths of the heart," and in his view that his art is essentially meditative and that the novelist works in the same way as the poet. 2. "To Bewilder Sensation: Surrealism in As I Lay Dying," Mary Rohrberger, Oklahoma State University. (20 min.) Surrealists set out to bewilder sensation and thus to revitalize matter by resituating objects in relation to themselves and their audience. The object was to unsettle cliche-ed habits of thinking and elevate the subconscious to a position of power. In this way the see-er became the seer, who alone is free. The structure and effects of As I Lay Dying suggest that Faulkner must have agreed. 3. "Misogyny in Mr. Sammler's Planet," Robert E. Colbert, Louisiana State University in Shreveport. (20 min.) Saul Bellow's Mr. Sammler's Planet is remarkable in a number of respects. Unfortunately, one of these respects is a negative one. For how is the reader to account for the uniformly negative portraits of all the book's many female characters? A close examination of key passages will reveal that the author himself is at a number of points implicated in the misogynous views of his protagonist. The conclusion of this paper speculates on two of the possible causes of the book's misogynous dimensions. 4. Business session. Election of officers. 5. "Warren's Audubon: A Portrait of the Artist," William Bedford Clark, Texas A&amp;M University. (20 min.) Authors of American long poems often resurrect and meditate upon historical figures as a way of relating the poem's present to the nation's collective past, and Robert Penn Warren follows this precedent in Audubon: A Vision. It is particularly significant that Warren chose an artist as his protagonist, for Audubon's creative quest stands as a paradigm for modern man's need to achieve a viable "vision" to structure his life with meaning. Furthermore, the poem suggests the powerful role art can play in nurturing an integrated sense of self, especially within a society undergoing intellectual and political turmoil. 6. "The Poems That Be: Pound's Homage to Sextus Propertius I and Williams's Paterson V," Linda Leavell, Rice University. (20 min.) In their search for poetic form in the twentieth century, Ezra Pound and William Carlos Williams developed theories of the "vortex" and the "poem as a field of action," respectively. While the two forms have much in common (both are patterned, measured energy), the language they put into these patterns is quite dissimilar. Whereas Williams objectifies his words by divesting them of all but denotative meaning, Pound divests his allusions of nearly all meaning, thereby setting them free in the vortex. Pound's Homage to Sextus Propertius I and Williams's Paterson V illustrate their poetic theories both structurally and thematically. 7. "William Carlos Williams and Marcel Duchamp: Anti-Art or American Poetry?" Gwen Raaberg, The University of Texas at Dallas. (20 min.) For the past decade or more, an increasing amount of criticism has been focused on the influence of modern art, both European and American, upon the poetry of William Carlos Williams. The influence of Marcel Duchamp on Wiliams, however, has not received adequate critical attention, undoubtedly because of the contradictory nature of Williams' response to Duchamp and his anti-art theories and practices. The key to reconciling Williams' contradictory statements and to determining the extent of his indebtedness to Duchamp lies in recognizing that Williams used Duchamp's anti-art theories and techniques for his own purpose - which was to develop a twentieth-century American poetry. COMPARATIVE LITERATURE- Parlor D Chairman: Wendy B. Faris, University of Texas at Dallas Secretary: Barbara Carr, Stephen F. Austin State University 1. "The Meterology of Despair: The Prevailing Conditions of Werther and Roquentin," Martha Satz, Southern Methodist University. ( 12 min.) Two young chroniclers, Werther and Roquentin, carefully record the pace and pattern of their encroaching despair in a written form that paradoxically protests its own inadequacy. Sorrows of Young Werther and Nausea share much: authors who advocate theoretically- developed, unconventional, yet similar views of the emotions and protagonists who agonize over the gap between experience and its expression and the chasm between the order imposed by narrative and the reality testifying to its absence. However, the books end differently - not because of their individuating characteristics but because the philosophical position embedded in each work necessitates its end. 2. "Irony and Existentialism," Donald Palumbo, Northern Michigan University. (15 min.) Both irony and the absurd depend on the mind's recognition of the divorce between the actual and the imagined for their existence. Thus, it is appropriate that irony is extensively used to indicate the absurd, a central concept in existential philosophy, in existential literature. Moreover, as both evolve from recognition of the absurd, existentialism and its literature generate their own ironies in their analysis of nearly every aspect of man's situation they then consider: his pervasive alienation, the burdens of freedom and guilt, his perceptual reactions to his condition, and his possible responses. 43 Fall, 1981 THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN</page><page sequence="2">THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN FaIl, 1981 Friday Morning Continued 3. "Everybody Comes to Roquentin's: Nausea and Casablanca," Steven G. Kellman, University of Texas at San Antonio. (10 min.) Despite differences of medium, ambition, and politics, Nausea (1938) and Casablanca (1942) are remarkably similar. Roquentin and Rick are kindred independent spirits withdrawn to desolate cities after colorful adventures in exotic locations. Each has discarded illusions he cherished earlier. Reappearance of Anny in Roquentin's life, like that of Ilsa in Rick's, revives memories of times when each still believed in the power of love. In both works, a foreign jazz song recurring at strategic moments and associated with social outcasts reminds the protagonist of possibilities of more coherent, luminous states. Beginning from similar premises, Roquentin and Rick adopt differing strategies of transcendence. 4. "Vargas Llosa's Mangacheria: The Pleasures of Community," Julie Jones, University of New Orleans, Lake Front. (20 min.) This paper examines the relation of Alexander Dumas' musketeer novels and the Cour des Miracles scene in Victor Hugo's Notre Dame de Paris to the Mangache episodes in Mario Vargas Llosa's La Casa Verde, showing how Vargas Llosa adapts motifs from the earlier novels to a very different sort of narration. This discussion should give some indication of the author's intentions in writing the Mangache sequences. The paper argues that his presentation of La Mangacheria provides a positive counterpoint to the tales of failed lives that have led critics to regard La Casa Verde as an unrelievedly pessimistic novel. 5. Business session. Election of officers. 6. "Lessing on Time and Space in the Sister Arts: The Artist's Refutation," Michael Cohen, Murray State University. (15 min.) The commonsense view that painting is restricted to a single moment, while poetry is an art of duration excluding space, has its locus classicus in Lessing's Laocoon (1766). But the artists have never felt this limitation to a single moment. Similarly, the practice of artists and the observations of viewers belie the insistence that a painting's effect on a viewer is immediate, as opposed to the serial effect of a literary work. And as for the notion that poetry is an art of time which exludes space, the reader's reflection, bolstered by some psychological evidence, will show that it is false. 7."A Discovered Country: Tolstoy, Howells, and the Shakers," Harry Walsh, University of Houston. (15 min.) The impact of Tolstoy's writings on the later works of William Dean Howells is well documented. It turns out, however, that their literary association worked in both directions. There is strong evidence to indicate that Tolstoy consulted Howells' The Undiscovered Country while engaged in the study of the American Shaker sect. The reflection of Shaker doctrines in Tolstoy's The Kreutzer Sonata is discussed. 8. "Faulkner's Sanctuary and Dante's Inferno," Lance Lyday, Baylor University. (15 min.) A comparison of Faulkner's Sanctuary and Dante's Inferno reveals that Faulkner knew Dante's work and drew on it in his own fiction. The basic structure of Sanctuary parallels that of the Inferno, in that the opening chapter echoes Dante's first Canto and the concluding chapter echoes Dante's closing Canto. Other parts of the novel draw on many other scenes in the Inferno. Faulkner's "journey through the underworld" probably draws on other "underworlds" as well. Popeye's execution brings together several diverse allusions involving various "Satanic" figures. And the Luxembourg Gardens scene which concludes the novel echoes the underworld section of Homer's Odyssey. 9. "Dostoevski and Machado de Assis: Order, Progress, Art," Aden W. Hayes, Wesleyan University. (15 min.) Dostoevski's Notes from Underground and Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis' Posthumous Memoirs of Braz Cubas both employ hostile and agressive narrators who glory in their estrangement from society. As we now understand Notes to be an anti-utopian tract aimed at the Russian Radicals- an affirmation of the narrator's individuality and spiritual health - we must similarly recognize that Braz Cubas' truncated, disparate, self-contradictory narration is designed to militate against Brazil's strongest intellectual current with similar utopian aims - Positivism. Braz satirizes as "Humanitism" this all-embracing "silence" which threatens to engulf and reform him, and thus to consign him to the status he fears most - obscurity. ENGLISH IB: Renaissance Literature - Nueces Chairman: David C. Judkins, University of Houston Secretary: Michael Hall, Centenary College of Louisiana 1. "Bawdy Imagery in 'Aire and Angels,' "Glenn Irvin, East Texas State University. (15 min.) Bawdy images in John Donne's "Aire and Angels" form a complex system working on several levels: as nautical terms describing the lovers' positions, as commentary on the general moral situation, and as criticism of the sexual conduct of the mistress. 2. "Richard II: A Play on Words," Donna B. Haisty, Texas Christian University. (20 min.) Words about words are important images throughout Richard II, as is clear simply by noting the frequent references to tongues, speech, and words themselves. On one level, the play is about the power of words, a power that resides in the ability to link words to reality. Richard has to learn that words lose their power when not grounded in reality. Bolingbroke's view of the power of words changes as he gains the power that Richard loses and as he realizes that his words have saved Aumerle, but have destroyed Richard. 3. "Thomas Deloney's Place in the History of Prose Fiction," Eugene P. Wright, North Texas State University. (20 min.) The insertion of realistic middle-class characters into prose fiction has long been seen by literary historians as Deloney's major contribution to the history of prose fiction. But his close attention to matters of characterization, imagery, and language makes him more deserving than Defoe of the title of creator of the prototype of the modern novel. 4. Business meeting. Election of officers. 5. "Textuality and Interpretation in The Merchant of Venice," Bruce Henricksen, Loyola University. (20 min.) In The Merchant of Venice a society is dominated by a text, the contract between Shylock and Antonio, but is ultimately liberated. Desire is thwarted by the contract but reassumes its rightful place at the center of governance with the aid of Portia's deconstructive reading. The tyrannical text is reinterpreted, not simply abandoned, and this is one of the numerous instances in Shakespeare where action flows from or through a text. 6. "Death and Spenserian Vice inParadise Lost," Phoebe S. Spinrad, Texas Christian University. (20 min.) In creating his allegorical figure of Death in Paradise Lost, Milton deliberately avoided the traditional skelton of THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN Fall, 1981</page><page sequence="3">FaIl, 1981 THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN 45 emblem books and memento mori art, which had become so common that it was almost a comic grotesque rather than an epic horror. The shape of Death in Paradise Lost, "if shape it might be call'd," is rather a shapeless mass meant to evoke all remembered horrors, and in its ghastly movements through the epic, it especially reverberates with echoes of Spenser's great monsters in The Faerie Queene: Errour, Envie, Lust, and humanity's archenemy, Despayre. 7. "Shakespeare Discovers the Moral Hell: A Re-evaluation of Titus Andronicus, 'But Brian Bedford Made Me Do It.' "Louis Charles Stagg, Memphis State University. (15 min.) It is Titus' play, his tragedy, not Aaron's. Brian Bedford's brilliant, tremendously moving production of Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus at the Stratford, Canada, 1980 Shakespeare Festival devastated and enthralled packed houses and earned a ten minute standing ovation the Wednesday afternoon last July when I was there, establishing the play as one of Shakespeare's most powerful, a conclusion I previously would have called ridiculous. Spectators were drained of emotion because of what Titus, like Lear, had to endure. Though flawed, Titus survived as long as he did through nobility of spirit, though shattered by grief. ENGLISH IIA: Nineteenth-Century Literature - San Antonio Chairman: Marilyn D. Georgas, Lamar University Secretary: John F. Schell, University of Arkansas at Little Rock 1. "The Latter-Day Dickens: Carlyle and the 'Uncommercial,'" Scott Foll, Florida State University. (20 min.) In gauging Dickens' social attitudes, as expressed in The Uncommercial Traveller, it is interesting to observe how even in his most intimate and confiding narrative voice, Dickens reflected the shaping and forming influence of Thomas Carlyle. The clarifying quality of Carlyle's presence in the essay series is useful in understanding the negative, public side of Dickens' dual-voiced persona where one is most aware of his sense of outrage at the pervasive lack of moral responsibility in mid-Victorian society. In tracing the journalistic manifestation of this well-known literary relationship, one sees the creative means Dickens employed in making their shared social ideas his own. 2. "George Eliot's 'Grand Favourite' and The Mill on the Floss," Christopher Baker, Lamar University. (20 min.) A comparison of George Eliot's The Mill on the Floss and Nathaniel Hawthorne's The House of the Seven Gables reveals that his influence upon her early career extended beyond the use of similar character types or stylistic touches which scholars have noted. Her novel shares with his, among other things, a deep concern with the conflict between individualism and determinism. While Hawthorne's determinism is linked more closely with historical Calvinism than is Eliot's philosophical determinism, derived from John Stuart Mill, Eliot explores issues which had been treated nine years before by an author she called a "grand favourite" of hers. 3. "Pater's Imaginary Portraits: Love and the Paterian Melancholy," Natalie Schroeder, The University of Mississippi. (20 min.) Pater's Imaginary Portraits are aborted love stories which repeat motifs developed in "The Child in the House." The English youth Florian Deleal desires a place "inclosed and sealed," an undefined yearning called "home-sickness," which, in the later foreign-set portraits, becomes a frustrated longing for the impossible. Each protagonist becomes obsessed with gloom and becomes involved in varying degrees with a woman. When their search for love and warmth is frustrated, they all commit symbolic suicides. The Paterian home-sickness cannot be satisfied by human, sexual love; it is a yearning for the impossible which ultimately leads to death. 4. "A Picture Gallery Unrivalled of Its Kind: Blackwood's American West and the Idea of Democracy," Stephen Tatum, University of Arkansas at Little Rock. (20 min.) Commentators on the westering experience in America agree that the way in which an observer has portrayed the West is conditioned by the observer's personality and social context. The idea and image of the American West put forth in Blackwood's magazine was functionally related to the magazine's view of democracy. That image changed sharply after 1849. Where before 1849 the magazine held a relatively benign view of the West and democracy because it adopted an early version of Turner's frontier hypothesis, after 1849 the magazine's view of the West becomes pessimistic as the open spaces of the prairie turned into the nightmares of the California gold diggings. 5. Business session. Election of officers. 6. "Wordsworth, Romanticism and Personification," Jerome Bump, University of Texas at Austin. (20 min.) Scientific suspicion of personification, and by extension metaphor and figurative language generally, stems from long-standing opposition to the idea of an anthropomorphic God interfering with the laws of nature. With the rise of science, and the decline of this concept of God among the intelligentsia, personification and the connection between man and nature it implies, fell into disrepute, even among poets. Josephine Miles dates the decline of personification in nature poetry from about the 1840's, but it can be traced to Wordsworth's assertion that there should be no essential difference between the languages of prose and of poetry. 7. "Politics and Religion in Byron's Heaven and Earth," Daniel P. Watkins, Delta State University. (20 min.) It has always been assumed that Byron's objective in Heaven and Earth was to show that somehow the upper and lower worlds need each other and gravitate toward each other despite God's commands. But Byron's larger purpose in this play was to define the connection between politics and religion. The much noted angel-man union is subordinate to this larger interest, serving mainly to clarify and emphasize the play's political message. Heaven and Earth examines the source of many social attitudes and assumptions treated in Byron's earlier writings, showing the profound impact of religion on society, and supplying thereby an explanation of how systems of values can be used to manipulate people. 8. "Newman's Fourteenth Oxford University Sermon and the Polemics of the Oxford Movement," James David Earnest, Murray State University. (18 min.) There is a self-portrait in the fourteenth of John Henry Newman's Oxford University Sermons (1843). This sermon, preached on 1 June 1981, at the height of the controversy surrounding the publication of Tract 90, presents an attractive Tractarian version of a Christian Knight of Faith, pure and wise in heart and in practice, doing battle with rationalists, sceptics, utilitarians, and latitudinarians. It is doubtful that Newman was consciously presenting a self-portrait as such, but the large audience who heard the sermon cannot have failed to connect this Knight of Faith with Newman himself. Although Sermon XIV has gone largely unnoticed by critics and historians, it is, perhaps, Newman the controversialist and rhetorician at his subtlest. Fall, 1981 THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN 45</page><page sequence="4">46 THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN Fall, 1981 Friday Morning Continued ENGLISH VI: General Linguistics - Parlor B Chairman: Barbara T. Dogger, Navarro College Secretary: Silas Griggs, North Texas State University Theme: "Ports to Conquer in the '80's: Linguistics for the New Decade" 1. "Phonological and Orthographic Aspects of Reading Thai Tone Syllables," Nantana Ongroongraung and Curt M. Rulon, North Texas State University. (25 min.) A pioneering effort, this paper is a distinctive feature phonological overview of the Thai system of representing and reading the five tones of this oriental language, the conventional orthographic syllabary of which is based on the Devangari. The analysis features (1) a refined notion of "live" and "dead" syllable, (2) an important reanalysis of the phonological status of the glottal stop, (3) trans- literations for an English language readership, and (4) a rule summary in linguistic notation for interpreting both explicit and non-explicit tone syllables. 2. "Writing and the Orality-Literacy Continuum," Helmut Esau, Texas A&amp;M University, and Michael Keene, University of Tennessee. (25 min.) In "Literacy and Orality in Our Times" Ong insists that writing teachers consider the problems of moving from oral expression to literacy in order to understand students' writing problems and to teach writing skills effectively. Esau and Keene (1980,1981), applying the TESOL model to writing, have similarly advocated that the teaching of writing entails moving students from oral expression (the "native language") to writing (the "target language"). This paper illustrates the explanatory adequacy which the concept of an orality-literacy continuum possesses for writing errors (such as defensive writing, monotonous writing, and problems with cueing extralinguistic context) and for reading miscues. 3. "Ji, an Intransitivizing Affix in Gugu-Yalangi," Jan Ware, North Texas State University. (25 min) R. M. W. Dixon has reported a verbal affix -ji in Yidin which marks the following: (1) an "anti-passive" construction, (2) a reflexive construction, (3) an inanimate agent, (4) a human agent who achieves a result accidentally, and (5) a continuous action. Gugu-Yalanji, a neighboring language, has a similar verbal affix, -ji, which performs the same functions as (2), (4), and (5) above, but which marks a construction more similar to passive than "antipassive." Hopper and Thompson indicate the above factors are features of transitivity, while evidence from Uto-Aztecan links reflexives and passives. These data suggest that both passive and "anti-passive" are intransitivization processes. 4. "Linguistics and the Language of 'Ode on a Grecian Urn'," Beatrice Mendez Egle, Texas A&amp;M University. (25 min.) A linguistic analysis of Keats' "Ode on a Grecian Urn" offers a new approach to understanding the ambiguities in the poem. The lexical groupings suggest the poem is negative in tone and mood. Such a focus on language reveals that the world of the figures on the urn is an unnatural one and that the figures are frustrated in their desires and intentions. Furthermore, it reveals the gradual change in the poet/speaker's attitude toward the urn. Finally, the lexical groupings point to the speaker's frustration in the end as he realizes that the secrets of life and eternity, though known by the urn, must remain unattainable to him- and to all men. 6. "Linguistic Findings From Efforts to Develop Computerized Spelling Aids," Diana Mae Sims, Texas Instruments. (25 min.) Computer professionals are developing software to correct writers' spelling and hyphenation. The programs compile dictionaries from texts and compute their "fog indices." Such projects are of interest to linguists who can answer questions incident to the software development. Questions include how to specify a "word," what digit/letter acronyms to list in a speller corpus, and what dialect to represent for efficient use of computer memory. Statistics from "speller" runs show that documents of several thousand words often yield dictionaries of under 2000 words. GERMAN I: Linguistics and German Literature Before 1700- Parlor C Chairman: Charles E. Weber, The University of Tulsa Secretary: Ingeborg Henderson, University of Missouri 1. "Indo-European Gods in Germanic Garb," Edgar C. Polome, University of Texas at Austin. (25 min.) Germanic religion is both complex and original in its renewal of the Indo-European heritage as shown by the fate of the celestial sovereign: a sky-god in the shape of the axis mundi - Irminsul - among the Saxons, he is also their tribal god; elsewhere, with the Germanic trend of focusing religion ideology on war, Ttwas appears as equivalent to Mars, but he is also a lord of justice, presiding over the tribal assembly. Bellicose exhaltation and shamanic ecstasy characterize the Odinic creed, but divine inspiration and magical powers are features inherited from the Indo-European sovereign god. 2. "The Northern Folktales as Pre-Modern Approaches to the Problem of Psychic Evolution," Lynn L. Remly, John Carroll University. (20 min.) Although the function of traditional literature in the process of an initiate's transformation from childhood to adulthood is generally well-known, only a close analysis reveals the depth of perception of this problem of psychic evolution as manifest in the Western European folktales. Long before Freud, the northern tales recorded by the Grimm brothers show early man's desperate concern with coming to terms with his own consciousness, with his dynamic relation to his own self, and with his potentially disastrous confrontation with the society that expects him to become its member. 3. "Erec, Enite and Social Values: Systems in Flux," Sandra Frieden, University of Houston. (20 min.) A comparison of Chr6tien de Troyes' Erec et Enide, Hartmann von Aue's Erec, and the Old Norse Erex Saga reveals a divergence from previously existing views of the time regarding marriage, women, service and humility, and significant variations among the three versions. Such divergence from earlier views reflects a transitional state within the values of the twelfth-century feudal system. Feudal nobility supported the writing of courtly epics integrating the then new values of "courtly passion," gentility, and adventure into the already existing social order. The variations in these versions reflect adaption to the differing social norms of each projected audience. 4. "The Literary Classification of Dietrich und Wenezlan: A Reevaluation," Ruth H. Firestone, University of Missouri. (20 min.) In Mittelhochdeutsche Dietrichepik Joachim Heinzle attempts a literary classification of the mid-thirteenth-century Dietrich und Wenezlan fragment, a narrative which combines elements of the historical and aventiurehaften Dietrich traditions. His conclusions, based 46 THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN Fall, 1981 5. Business session. Election of officers.</page><page sequence="5">FaIl, 1981 THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN 47 upon inadequate assessment of the historical tradition, are misleading. It is the purpose of this paper to clear away Heinzle's misconceptions regarding the relationships between the historical and aventiurehaften traditions, then to reevaluate the evidence according to differences in content and transmission. This, in turn, leads to a less misleading conclusion regarding the literary classification of Dietrich und Wenezlan. 5. Business session. Election of officers. ITALIAN- Parlor A Chairman: Luisetta Chome, University of Houston Secretary: Rosetta di Pace Jordan, University of Oklahoma 1."Deledda's Archetypal Characterization: The Servant, the Bandit, and the Prostitute as Christ Figures," Mirta Pagnucci, Rice University. (20 min.) One of the central characters in Deledda's novels is often an altruistic figure who brings renewal and regeneration in others. This paper will examine the function of the Christ figure in the guise of the servant in Canne al vento, of the bandit in Marianna Sirca, and of the prostitute-mother in Cenere. 2. "Pirandello e Fontana: una nuova concezione dello spazio," Susan Keil, University of Houston. (20 min.) In "Sei personaggi in cerca d'autore" Pirandello, estendendo la scena tradizionale crea un nuovo spazio teatrale, cosi come Fontana, trascendendo i limiti della superficie pittorica raggiunge una nuova dimensione spaziale. Questa conquista stabilisce un nuovo contatto tra l'opera e il pubblico che dal tradizionale stato di passivita passa ad una fase di partecipazione attiva. 3. "L'Inferno dantesco nella Sicilia del Gattopardo," Antonella Pease, University of Texas. (20 min.) Nel romanzo di Tomasi di Lampedusa il rigoroso sistema di segni realizzato da Dante per tracciare nel regno dell'immoto il sentiero liberatorio che dalla selva oscura dell'ignoranza conduce alla chiarita del Logos, si ripropone come sterile e dispersiva composizione privata di significato, nella quale al moto ascensionale si sostituisce il girare a vuoto di una danza che concede soltanto l'illusione del movimento. 4. "I1 motivo dell'incesto nel Torrismondo," Vincenzo E. De Nardo, Southern Methodist University. (20 min.) L'analisi dell'incesto nel Torrismondo, tragedia non riuscita, consente di rilevare come il Tasso, che con essa si propone italo Sofocle, succube del suo disperato intellettualismo e impregnato di pessimismo cristiano, non riesca a riproporre drammaticamente le suggestioni del modello greco. 5. "The Theme of Synagogue, Ecclesia, and the Whore of Babylon in Cantos XXIX to XXXIII of Purgatorio and in Chaucer's Wife of Bath's Tale," Nancy Chmaitelli, Rice University. (20 min.) The great Gothic cathedral artists, working in stone and stained glass, created balanced depictions of Synagogue and Ecclesia to demonstrate the fulfillment of the Old Covenant in the New and to instruct the individual Christians. Poets, who were not dependent upon church patronage, were free to use this theme in a different way. The paper examines the treatment of this theme by Dante in Cantos XXIX to XXXIII of the Purgatorio and by Chaucer in the Wife of Bath's Tale. 6. Business session. Election of officers. SPANISH I: Spanish Literature - Colorado Chairman: Carmen Chaves McClendon, Mississippi State University Secretaries: Kay Engler, University of Tulsa (Pre-1700) Luis Costa, Texas A&amp;M University (Post-1700) 1. "Possible Sources of Lope's Corona trdgica," Michael G. Paulson, University of Central Arkansas. (20 min.) Lope de Vega's Corona trdgica is a lengthy epic poem which treats the life, times, and demise of Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots. It remains as one of the least studies of the Fenix's works and has escaped scholarly attention until recently. One of the topics which requires further study and investigation is that of its origins. This paper will examine the probable sources to include Conn, Blackwood, Leslie, as well as the playwright, Antoine de Montchrestien, whose La Reine d'Ecosse possesses the highest degree of affinity to the Corona. By an analysis of structure, images, and references, plus an examination of the probable means of transmission to Lope, it attempts to show the major inspiration for the 1627 epic. 2. "Cadalso's Noches lugubres: Ambivalence and Conflict," David Goldin, Vanderbilt University. (20 min.) Critics of Jos6 Cadalso's Noches ligubres have generally taken one of two opposing conceptions of the work. The most traditional view had judged it to be, if not literally autobiographical, then at least an emotional outburst that directly represents the author's feelings towards a tragedy touching his own life. Another camp views the work as a sober allegory in which reason and enlightened altruism are gradually asserted over irrational and egotistical concerns. This discrepancy may be possibly explained by a fundamental ambivalency with regards to women and society in the character of Cadalso himself. The emotional vehemence below the surface of the sensitive, rational protagonist of the Noches might therefore be plausibly explained by the writer's own unconscious conflicts. 3. "El arte de ostentaci6n en Azorin," M. Laurentino Suarez, East Tennesee State University. (20 min.) En los ultimos afios se ha hecho mucho enfasis en la autocritica narrativa. Estudiosos como Gonzalo Sobejano, David Herzberger, y Antonio Risco, ya han escrito de esta nueva tendencia literaria. Tambi6n se ha seialado que ejemplos aislados de "metaficci6n" ya habian aparecido en diferentes epocas o periodos literarios, tales como Don Quijote, El amigo manso, Niebla, etc. Algunos de los libros de Azorin se pueden incluir en la lista, ya que este autor teoriza sobre la novela, a la vez que reflecciona sobre los problemas de la creaci6n literaria. Es posible que Capricho, publicada en 1943, se anticipe a mucho de esta corriente experimental de la novela autocritica que se ha puesto tan de moda en la decada de 1970. 4. "El retorno de Ulises: dos enfoques del mito en el teatro espafiol contemporaneo," Hazel Cazorla, University of Dallas. (25 min.) Se examinan dos obras de teatro, una de Buero Vallejo (La tejedora de suenos) y otra de Antonio Gala (,Por que corres, Ulises?) que ofrecen un tratamiento distinto cada una del mito de Penelope. Cada autor revela un acercamiento a la realidad contemporanea a traves de su enfoque del material hom6rico. Se contrasta la visi6n tragica de Buero con la c6mica, o tragi-c6mica, de Gala, analizando la estructura de las dos obras, su lenguaje y lo que significan los personajes y su escenificacion a la luz de cambios de actitud ocurridos en la sociedad espafiola durante el ultimo cuarto de siglo. 5. Business session. Election of officers. 6. "Concerning Silence as a Literary Technique in Contemporary Spanish Literature," Janet Diaz, Texas Tech University. (25 min.) Silence looms large in many narratives of Jesus THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN 47 Fall, 1981</page><page sequence="6">48 THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN Fall, 1981 Friday Afternoon Continued Fernandez-Santos, Elena Quiroga, Carmen Gaite and others, although frequently its presence is masked by the presence of interior monolog. Objective silence is to be found beyond subjective "noise" which does not at first appear to be silence. Silence takes many forms, from the subtle to the obvious, and is of varying duration, from the silencing of a single word or name to the silencing of an entire portion of a character's life. Its import is equally varied, yet very specific messages may be thereby conveyed. This paper suggests a few of the uses of silence as a narrative device and as a specific response to extra-literary conditions such as censorship. 7. "Algunas variaciones sobre el tema de la ceguera y sus manifestaciones en el teatro espanol de los afios cincuenta," Enrique Ruiz-Fornells, University of Alabama. (25 min.) Aparece en ese tiempo un grupo de comedias intensas al mismo tiempo que humanas. En el aparece 61 tema de la ceguera. En algunos casos la ceguera tiene un alcance unico que conduce a la tragedia personal y, al mismo tiempo, es el simbolo espiritual y mental que afecta a problemas politicos y sociales y llega, incluso, a la misma base de la existencia humana. En otros, aparece como un problema mAs relativo dentro de su propio dramatismo. Por ultimo, en determinadas circunstancias se presenta un ceguera espacial y mental a causa de la incomunicacion, directa o indirecta, que afecta a las personas y que a veces se trAnsforma en videncia en el transito entre la vida, la muerte y la vida real. WOMEN'S CA UCUSFOR THE MODERN LANGUAGES - Rio Grande Chairman: Peggy W. Prenshaw, University of Southern Mississippi Secretary: Corinne Dale, Texas A&amp;M University 1. "The Device of Juxtaposition in Mansfield's 'Something Childish But Very Natural,'" Lucile Morse, East Central University. (15 min.) One of the techniques that Katherine Mansfield uses to develop her short stories is juxtaposition, an arrangement of likenesses and unlikenesses to enhance a character, theme, mood, or situation. The story "Something Childish But Very Natural" well illustrates the technique. In this story of youth and youthful love, Mansfield juxtaposes Henry and Edna, symbols of good and evil, birds and insects, and colors. 2. "The Saving of a Lost Lady: Cather's Marian Forrester," Jane Nelson, Texas A&amp;M University. (20 min.) In A Lost Lady, Niel Herbert rejects Marian Forrester because she violates his male, aesthetic ideal. Cather's readers have generally agreed with Niel in their negative assessments of Marian. The many similarities between My Antonia and A Lost Lady suggest a different reading. Niel loses Marian not because of her ignominious decline but because he lacks the nerve and imagination to inherit the world of Captain Forrester, a pioneer who knew how to preserve the wild spirit in Marian's nature. Like Antonia, Marian embodies a vitality that eludes her timid and conventional male admirer. 3. "Dorothy L. Sayers's Fables of Modern Life," Dawson F. Gaillard, Loyola University. (20 min.) Known to many as the translator of Dante's Divine Comedy, Dorothy L. Sayers is also well known as the creator of detective tales that feature the spry detective Lord Peter Wimsey. This paper concentrates on Peter Wimsey's attitudes towards women to show how Sayers dramatized her society's changing values during the years between two world wars. To the mass audience of detective fiction Sayers prophesied and promoted a social revolution in male and female relationships. 4. Business session. Election of officers. (Coffee break arranged by Carol Gelderman, University of New Orleans.) 5. "An Overview of the Study of Women's Literature," Germaine Greer, University of Tulsa. The second part of the session will consist of Germaine Greer's address to the Caucus and a question period to follow. FRIDAY AFTERNOON October 23, 1981 2:30-4:00 p.m. ENGLISH IV: Folklore - San Antonio Chairman: William M. Clements, Arkansas State University Secretary: Glen E. Lich, Schreiner College 1. "The Performance Dimension in the Medieval Romance: A Discussion of Eilhart Von Oberge's Tristrant," George S. Peek, Arkansas State University. (20 min.) Roger Abrahams has outlined a way of considering the relationship of artist and audience for both oral and written forms. His discussion of relationship is important for two reasons: it articulates the essential quality of the artist as one who is integral with his audience; it demonstrates a methodology for understanding the literary text in its interactive dimension. Drawing upon studies in oral formulaic composition, Abrahams has developed a new and insightful tool to understand the effect of a literary text. The paper demonstrates the application of Abrahams' concepts to Eilhart Von Oberge's Tristrant. 2. "Occult Folklore in Shakespeare: Another Look at the Tudor-Stuart Myth," John W. Crawford, Henderson State University. (20 min.) Shakespeare's use of folklore in various forms is common knowledge to students of his drama. His reasons are somewhat ambiguous, but one which has been untreated extensively in critical analyses seems to be that of developing and strengthening his theme of faith in the mythical, occult elements of society, elements that mysteriously bind the folk together into a unified whole. This paper shows Shakespeare's interest in such a method by using selected tragedies, histories, and romances for illustration. 3. Business section. Election of officers. 4. "From Tin Pan Alley to a Georgia Chain Gang: The Evolution of the Ballad 'Frank Dupree, " Gretchen L. Bennett, Schreiner College. (20 min.) The American criminal ballad, "Frank Dupree," developed in a manner different from most ballads, moving from a historical event to a Tin Pan Alley recording based on that event, through communal recreation of the commercial recording to a somewhat more traditional ballad, to a black ballad quite different from the white versions, and from this black ballad to a seminal blues form. The black version shows traditional black ballad tendencies, but they differ from the white versions in that the emphasis shifts from Frank Dupree as guilty criminal to Frank Dupree as the mistreated victim characteristic in the blues. 48 THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN Fall, 1981</page><page sequence="7">FaIl, 1981 THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN 49 5. "Honky Tonk Women: Angels Without Halos; Queens Without Crowns," Sue Simmons McGinity, Tarleton State University. (25 min.) A major figure in the lyrics of current and past country music, honky tonk woman is eternally feminine. As a goddess, seductress, spiritual guide, maternal being, or any combination thereof, she is more often than not described in her relationship to males from the masculine viewpoint. The oxymoronic appellations by which she is most commonly known, honky tonk angel and honky tonk queen, acknowledge her dualistic and realistic musical image discussed in this paper. FRENCH I: French Literature to 1600 - Colorado Chairman: Joan H. Manley, The University of Texas at El Paso Secretary: Jerry C. Nash, The University of New Orleans 1. "The Narrative Web ofLaMortArtu,"Janice Heiple, The University of Texas at Austin. The narrative structure in the thirteenth-century French prose romance La MortArtu is difficult, developing in both a linear, chronological way and a spatial, discursive way. Much of its significance is inaccessible or misunderstood without an awareness of the non-sequential aspects of the narrative. The "historical" r6cit, recounting the events in a more or less chronological way, can be treated as the horizontal base line from which the writer can digress through analogical or parallel developments, or other techniques of spatial form. Appreciation of the esthetic principles underlying La Mort Artu permits the disentanglement of its webs of meaning. 2. "Didacticism and Satire in Early 16th-Century French Emblem Books," Irene M. Bergal, The University of Arkansas. (20 min.) In the 16th century, emblems were defined as a combination of picture and text designed to enhance the presentation of a moral lesson. This paper discusses the evolution of the authorial voice(s) charged with the transmission of the lessons. In the early works of La Perriere and Corrozet, a single didactic voice prevails; the lessons are directly addressed to the passive reader. In Gu6roult's work, however, the authorial voice alternately assumes the roles of teacher, commentator, and narrator. At times, their conflicting messages tend to undermine the "official wisdom" by introducing a satiric tone which engages the reader's active participation. 3. Business section. Election of officers. 4. "Music of the Early Renaissance," Arthur J. Gionet, North Texas State University. (20 min.) The British Library Manuscript Additional 35087 has an interesting history. It was commissioned in the early Renaissance and contains pieces in Flemish, French, Latin, Italian and one mixed French-Latin. Four chansons, Comentpeult avoirjoye, Dieugard de mal de deshonneur, Si j'ayme mon amy and Buvons ma comere et nous ne buvons pas, are samples of the popular songs great composers of polyphonic music used as a basis for their compositions. A tape recording made by the NTSU Madrigal singers will accompany the discussion of each chanson. 5. "Ronsard a l'oeuvre," Michel Dassonville, The University of Texas at Austin. (20 min.) Par la juxtaposition de trois poemes qu'a diff6rents moments Ronsard 6crivit sur le meme theme (en l'occurrence "Quand vous serez bien vieille..."), je me propose de mettre en lumiere ce qu'il est convenu d'appeler "le r6cit minimal," c'est-a-dire l'emploi du minimum de mots pour le maximum de sens. L'analyse proprement stylistique de trois psychodrames a d'abord pour but d'illustrer la maitrise que Ronsard apporte au metier d'6crire mais de sugg6rer aussi l'un des secrets de la puissance d'expression du poeme. FRESHMAN ENGLISH AND ENGLISH COMPOSITION - Nueces Chairman: Elizabeth F. Penfield, University of New Orleans Secretary: Beth Howard, University of Houston 1. "Matthew Arnold and the Study of Prose Composition," Ann Dobie, University of Southwestern Louisiana. (20 min.) Matthew Arnold never considered himself a professional educator, yet for thirty-five years he served as an inspector of schools in England. Although his statements on the study of languages, on the relative importance of genres, and on pedagogy are at odds with his practices, the evidence of his life and work suggests that Arnold was, perhaps without his full awareness, a powerful influence leading to the inclusion of the study of prose composition in the educational system of his own country and that of all English speaking cultures. 2. "A Conceptual Framework for Evaluating College Writing Programs and Courses," Stephen P. Witte, University of Texas at Austin. (20 min.) Although the evaluation of college writing programs and courses has become a matter of great concern to those charged with the teaching of college writing and with the administration of college writing programs, knowledge of how to conduct such evaluations remains at an impressionistic and rudimentary level. To remedy that situation, the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE) and the University of Texas at Austin are underwriting a three-year project for evaluating college writing programs and courses. 3. Business session. Election of officers. 4. "Writing Writing, Writing Reading," Russell Long, Tarleton State University. (20 min.) Although the pre-writing - writing - rewriting paradigm is commonly used in composition classes, in practice the central step is often ignored because of the difficulty in assessing the mental operations being performed. Beginning with the hypothesis that the good writer is simultaneously playing the role of good oral reader, I designed a research project attempting to discover common features of writing and oral reading and to identify possible remediation techniques for poor writers. On the basis of this research, there is evidence that there are shared dysfunctions in the two activities and that certain exercises in oral reading can improve writing skills. 5. "The Scholar/Clown: A Performance Approach to the Teaching of Composition," Ellen Dowling, Texas A&amp;M University. (20 min.) This paper examines practical methods of overcoming fear and loathing in the college composition class by applying the principles of dramatic performance to the teacher's role as stimulator of student interest and creativity. It deals with both the "What" of writing - games and gimmicks to stir up the students' enthusiasm to the point where they realize that writing may indeed be "fun" (surprise!) - and the "How" of presenting these exercises: dramatic techniques by which the teacher can improve his/her own classroom performance and thereby become a "Scholar/Clown" - one who not only understands the scholarly aspects of his/her field, but can present them in an enlightening and entertaining way. Fall, 1981 THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN 49</page><page sequence="8">50TESUHCNRL ULTNFI,18 Friday Afternoon Continued GERMAN-AMERICAN LITERATURE - Parlor C Chairman: Hubert Heinen, University of Texas at Austin Secretary: Erika Nielsen, University of Houston 1. "Karl Peter Heinzen: German-American Humanist, Activist, and Radical Journalist," Siegfried E. Heit, Oral Roberts University. (16 min.) One of the most controversial German-American journalists, Karl Peter Heinzen was a political activist, participant in the 1848 revolutions in Central Europe, and a radical journalist. His writings are full of complaints about public affairs throughout the thirty years he lived in the United States, but his criticism was offset by his admiration for the Bill of Rights and the Constitution. His career was a monument to his desire to extend the guarantees of personal freedom to every living American. 2. "Carl, Prince of Solms-Braunfels in Reality and Myth," Theodore Gish, University of Houston. (16 min.) The portrait of Prince Solms which emerges from his own letters, reports, and travel guide can be evaluated in the light of reminiscences by contemporary eyewitnesses (e.g. Caroline von Hinuber, Louis Reinhardt) and the critical appraisals of later historians. Despite the negative assessments of objective sources, fictional portrayals of him (e.g. those in the writings of Hermann Seele and Fritz Goldbeck) and the legends recounted by subsequent generations of German Texans are generally positive. The differences in these points of view deserve closer scrutiny. 3. "The Life and Works of Kuno Francke," Richard Spuler, University of Houston. (16 min.) Kuno Francke's career as a leading scholar of German Studies in America began in 1884 at Harvard University. In his memoirs, Francke (1855-1930) assesses the role he played during his nearly fifty years in America as a mediator of German culture. His Social Forces in German Literature (1896) recast German scholarship in America; his campaign for a Germanic Museum at Harvard (1903) attests to his missionary commitment. Francke's biography forms an interesting and significant chapter in the history of Germanistik in America. This paper will focus on his work around the turn of the century. 4. Business session. Election of officers. 5. "The Intellectual in Stefan Heym's The Crusaders," Michael Winkler, Rice University. (16 min.) The intellectual in Heym's novel is called upon to justify the American military effort in WWII Europe. In liberation and interrogation scenes, American, European, and Nazi mentalities confront each other. Through their purposelessness they reveal a semi-fascist corruption and near-total lack of faith in patriotic and democratic principles. Heym's attack on the metaphor of war as a crusade can be contrasted with the promulgation of such a metaphor in novels by American war veterans and the writings of Regler and Eisenhower. 6. "Once More: '. . . Remember the Ladies...,'" Lisa Kahn, Texas Southern University. (16 min.) Since 1978, when the German writings of contemporary women in the U.S. were anthologized, there has been an astonishing new outpouring of German prose and poetry by these and other women of German and Austrian descent. A wider audience should be aware of the quality and quantity of poems, prose texts, and books being written. Students must also examine if and how the American experience of these women is reflected in their writing, and whether these literary contributions fit what is commonly termed German-American literature. GRADUATE STUDENT CAUCUS - Rio Grande Chairman: Cheryl L. Ware, Texas A&amp;M Uniersity Secretary: Janice Oliver, L.S.U. - Baton Rouge 1. "On Being 'Terminal': Life after the M.A.," Lou Thompson, Lamar University. (10 min.) Certainly a Ph.D. can be a hindrance outside the academic world, as many "over-qualified" job seekers will testify. But graduate students who are completing or have already completed the M.A. and who intend to remain in academia should be aware of the financial, academic, professional, and psychological advantages of postponing or even abandoning their doctoral studies in favor of gaining fulltime teaching experience. Such experience can be helpful in gaining admittance to a doctoral program and of course ultimately in finding a permanent teaching job. Granted, returning to school after several years involves some difficult adjustments, but the experience gained makes the delay worthwhile. 2. "Of Burn-Out and Other Problems," George Murray, Director of Education, Beaumont Neurological Center. (15 min.) There are some problems that many students probably anticipate before they enter graduate school: there are also some that are seldom so anticipated. This presentation will address some of these problems. It will also consider the adjustments one makes when leaving an academic job and entering the non-academic world. 3. "Alternate States: The English Major in Unfamiliar Territory," Richard Taylor, Junior Writer, IBM. (15 min.) This presentation demonstrates other approaches to employment that English majors have available as professional writers. The routines of the writer are compared to those of the traditional major. Preparation for the job is discussed to show how the English major can achieve greater employability in the alternate states of business. The jobs available are shown with some correlation of the preparation required to the jobs that are possible. Finally, the programs for technical writers are discussed to show that English majors have more opportunities available to them than just teaching. 4. "The Sorcerer's Apprentice," Alden R. Turner, Texas A&amp;M University. (10 min.) In a current MLA publication, The Teaching Apprentice Program in Language and Literature (1981), we are provided with a useful survey of the nature and structure of "T.A." programs. The place of these programs within our changing profession demands the kind of comprehensive reevaluation that few departments are willing or able to undertake without some satisfactory basis for more candid discussion of their current practices and future needs. As a starting point for reevaluation, this book offers us an opportunity to see who we are becoming through our apprenticeships and a glimpse of what apprenticeships might become in our profession. 5. Business session. Election of officers. 6. "Resume and Vita Preparation for Academic and Non-academic jobs," Gene Young, Texas A&amp;M University. (20 min.) This preparation speaks to ways of preparing a resume or vita for both academic and non-academic jobs. It briefly tests the differences in purpose and execution of the resume and the vita. Then it discusses the need for preparing a different resume or vita for a non-academic job than one would prepare for an academic job. Important here is a treatment of how items included in an academically-oriented job application can actually work against the applicant for non-academic employment.

SLAVIC AND EAST EUROPEAN LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES- Parlor A Chairman: Miroslav John Hanak, East Texas State University Secretary: To be nominated 1. "'Gogol, Come Forth!' A Critical Analysis of Oleksander Ohloblyn's Ancestry of Mykola Gogol (Hohol)," E. Ray Cox, Texas Tech University. (20 min.) Oleksander Ohloblyn takes issue with Gogol's biographers, accusing them of misrepresentation of the great author's origins and hence of the ethnic nature of his writings. Against the tide of popular literary opinion, prevalent in the Soviet Union as well as in the West, Ohloblyn provokes his readers to consider whether Gogol was a Russian writer who reflected his Ukrainian past, or whether he was a Ukrainian writer who circumstantially wrote in the Russian language. Ohloblyn's study calls for an objective examination of its avant-garde position and of the question which aspect of the Gogol-Hohol personality is dominant. 2. "Time, Memory, Imagination: Bely's Kotik Letaev," Alexandra Heidi Karriker, The University of Oklahoma at Norman. (25 min.) Kotik Letaev is an autobiographical novel which explores the child's conceptualization of the self as refracted through the adult's memory. It poses many questions about the nature of a child's comprehension of experience and his assimilation of external phenomena. The novel presents an objectification of the relationships among time, memory, and imagination through the use of repetition, paronomasia, visual effects, and a play with perspective which results in that jarring vision which the Formalists called ostranenie. 3. "Tudor Arghezi: A Major Romanian Poet of the 20th Century," George Preda, East Texas State University. (20 min.) Arghezi's poetry reflects a strong sense of ancestral continuity, the torment of a soul in search of the absolute, and apocalyptical visions of a decaying world. His art combines eternal human feelings with refined artistic sense. The visions he conjures move between anathemas of Biblical prophets and present-day anxiety. Thanks to an interplay of images and rhythms, Arghezi bites into reality discovering a new formula for classicism. His poetry shows a vertical line, uninterrupted; its material and substance are a fantastic germination of nature. The best way to understand his poetry is to compare his masterpiece, the poem "Testament," with Charles Peguy's "Le Sommeil." 4. "The Serbian Satirist Radoje Domanovic," Nikola R. Pribic, Florida State University. (20 min.) The last turbulent decades of nineteenth-century political life in Serbia found its sharpest critic in Radoje Domanovic. In his political satires he criticized the despotic rule of the Obrenovic dynasty and its corrupt administration. This paper intends to examine some of the most important of Domanovic's satires, such as Vodja (The Leader), Danga (The Brand Mark), Kraljevic Marko po drugi put medu Srbima (King Mark's Second Time Among the Serbs), and several others. These satires are examined by comparison with the works of the leading satirists of world literature such as Jonathan Swift and Mark Twain, as well as with works of his fellow-Serbians. An attempt will also be made to explain Radoje Domanovic's unique place in the history of Serbian literature. 5. "Ukrainian Translations of Goethe's Lyric Poems," Wolodymyr T. Zyla, Texas Tech University. (35 min.) In the development of the Ukrainian artistic translation, translations of Goethe's lyric poems occupy a significant place. At the beginning of the nineteenth century Goethe was well known in the Ukraine, where his creativity was highly valued and his works greatly respected. There are about 200 translations of Goethe's lyric works in the Ukraine, among them some eighty which show great artistic merit, originality, and fidelity to the German originals. This paper treats seven poems in which the translators search for ways to bring the artistic and thematic resources of the original into agreement with Ukrainian poetic concepts. The relative strengths and weaknesses are also carefully scrutinized. 6. Business session. Election of officers. SOUTH CENTRAL AMERICAN DIALECT SOCIETY Parlor B Chairman: Scott Baird, Trinity University Secretary: Curt M. Rulon, North Texas State University 1. "Generation Differences in the Austin Area," Patty Reagan, Abilene Christian University. (10 min.) An exhaustive study of dialect variation within a ten-county area in Central Texas, with Austin (Travis county) being in the southern portion of the area, was conducted over a two-year period. This paper will briefly discuss the sampling and elicitation process in general, but concentrate on the most significant findings of the study - the correlation between generation differences and dialect variation. 2. "The Influences of Migratory Routes on Arkansas Dialects," Raouf Halaby, Ouachita Baptist College. (15 min.) Distinct dialect differences can be found in the four "corners" of Arkansas. This paper will discuss the methods used to discern these dialect differences. It will also discuss the relationship between geography and linguistic variation, in a cursory fashion. The focus of the paper will be upon the striking correlation between migratory, mostly east-west, movement during the early years of Arkansas development and present-day dialect variation. 3. "Regional Variation in American Sign Language: A Look at Texas and California Dialects," Dorothy M. Lee, The University of Texas at Austin. (15 min.) Regional variation is common in American Sign Language (ASL), especially across state lines, and usually stemming from state schools for the deaf. Much of this variation can be seen to be parallel to that of variation in speech. Where in speech, sounds are described by determining place, manner, and voicing, signs can be described by specifying handshape, place, palm orientation, and movement. Also in speech, distinct lexical items may vary in different localities. This paper will discuss both signing variation and lexical variation between California and Texas users of ASL. 4. "George Washington Cable's French-English Dialect and the Free Indirect Style," William Evans, Louisiana State University. (15 min.) One unexplored facet of Louisianian George Washington Cable's 1870's literary dialect is his use of a method resembling the free indirect style first noted in contemporary French writers. It strikes an English reader particularly in the portrayal of French-English-speaking Fall, 1981 THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN 51</page><page sequence="10">54 THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN FaIl, 1981 Friday Afternoon Continued characters, of course, because of the unEnglish ring of examples such as "it must not that anything de trop take place in his house." Though the method appears in several forms throughout Cable's New Orleans fiction as a subtle means of suggesting French speech, or simply milieu, it tends to diminish in his later Creole stories, where interestingly - the French-English dialogue is increasingly abundant. 5. Business session. Election of officers. SOUTH CENTRAL SOCIETY FOR THE STUDY OF SOUTHERN LITERATURE - Trinity Chairman: Philip Castille, University of Houston, Downtown Campus Secretary: Michael Kreyling, Tulane University 1. "Precursor of Twain: Simms and Southwestern Humor in the Novel," Charles S. Watson, University of Alabama. (20 min.) In the modern rediscovery of Southwestern humor, William Gilmore Simms' contribution has yet to be fully appreciated. No other professional author before Twain repeatedly attempted to assimilate this material into the novel. In Border Beagles Simms portrayed a comic Shakespearean actor, reciting from Hamlet at an outlaw's hideout. In Confession he presented an early example of the Texas braggart; in Eutaw, the humorous religious experience. His most important experiment is in the historical romance Woodcraft which includes such motifs as battling the sheriff. By infusing the historical plot with Southwestern humor, Simms presaged a new development in the novel. 2. "Mark Twain's Participation in Presidential Politics," Kay M. McCord, Baylor University. (18 min.) Mark Twain's dislike for politics made him only spasmodically active in presidential political campaigns. Even when he was actively concerned about a particular campaign, he was never an ardent party supporter. "His interest in curtailing government corruption led him into active involvement in three presidential races: he supported Hayes in the election of 1876, Garfield in 1880, and Blaine in 1884." Toward the end of his life, he saw his efforts as fruitless and became disillusioned about the possibility of cleaning up government regardless of which presidential candidate was elected. It seemed to him that mindless party loyalty had prevailed, and the cause he had fought for - civil service reform - was lost. Accordingly, he withdrew from his involvement in presidential politics. 3. "John Gould Fletcher and the Arkansas Folklore Society," E. Leighton Rudolph, University of Arkansas. (16 min.) John Gould Fletcher began collecting folksongs in central Arkansas shortly after his return from abroad in 1933. Although he failed to find a publisher for them, he agitated for the formation of a society for the preservation of folklore. In 1947 he met Vance Randolph, who guided and encouraged him. In 1949, as a visiting professor at the University of Arkansas, Fletcher and others planned a folk festival at which the society was officially formed on July 11. Fletcher was elected president and was active in recruiting and planning for the next annual meeting but died before it met. 4. Business session. Election of officers. 5. "His Life in Letters: Some Epistolary Images of William Faulkner," James G. Watson, University of Tulsa. (20 min.) No sort of writing is more revealing of its author than the personal letter. Each is a fragment of autobiography containing a studied epistolary image of the letter writer. The guises he assumes in his letters show the shapes and depths of the letter writer's life. The letters mirror the man. Although William Faulkner wrote relatively fewer letters than his literary contemporaries, they reveal the shifting images of himself he presented to the world. The more persistent of these he transmuted, in letter form, into his art. 6. "The Knight and the Artist: Tasso and Faulkner's 'Carcassonne,'" M. E. Bradford, University of Dallas. (18 min.) "Carcassonne" is the "finale" in William Faulkner's Collected Stories. Its location or placement at the conclusion of the series of forty-two stories is a comment on the organization of the set as a whole and on the role of the artist as suggested by that arrangement. The story centers on a repeated, inconclusive event and contains no action in the strict sense of the word. But that act represented in the chivalric image of crusade borrowed from Tasso's Jerusalem Delivered need not achieve any final results in order to bring the writer to "his own Carcassonne" - to win a victory over death and insignificance. SPANISH III: Linguistics - Parlor D Chairman: Philip Smyth, North Texas State University Secretary: M. Francille Bergquist, Vanderbilt University 1. "Translation of the Old West in Moder Spanish," Vivian M. Gruber, Stephen F. Austin State University. (15 min.) The series of Spanish novels published weekly which portray the 19th-century American cowboy (designated "paella westerns" by the writer) attempts to recreate atmosphere in language which simulates the typical expressions of the American cowboy. The vocabulary reflects violence and "traditional" western values. Some words are arrastrar, colgar (both persons and arms), cobarde, disparar por los dos ojos, el sheriff (or el de la placa) and many others. This paper proposes to compare the meanings of these words based on context, three dictionaries (Covarrubias, Corominas, and the Academia), and on samples from contemporary American cowboy fiction. 2. "El vocabulario zool6gica en Poeta en Nueva York," Carlos M. de Onis, North Texas State University. (15 min.) El vocabulario de Poeta en Nueva York nos da la indole dela fantasia surrealista de Lorca. Es especialmente notable el uso constante de vocabulario de origen zoologico (aparecen en la obra todo genero de animales) lo que no puede menos de parecer extrano en un libro sobre Nueva York. El examen de este fen6-meno arroja mucha luz sobre la atm6sfera peculiar del mundo po6tico de Poeta en Nueva York. 3. "Una escala socio-lingiiisica del espafiol antillano del siglo XIX," Maria Paez de Ruiz, Southwest Texas State University. (15 min.) Cirilo Villaverde (1812-1894), el iniciador de la novela en Cuba, fue tambi6n precursor del g6nero en hispanoamerica. Su novels Cecilia Vald6s (1839-1879), la trAgica historia de una bellisima mulata, amada y abandonada por el hijo de un arist6crata, denuncia la injusticia de una raza oprimida por otra. Pero especialmente, tiene el merito indiscutible de presentar "una escala socio-linguistica" del espafiol hablado en Cuba - y por extensi6n en las Antillas hispinicas - a principios del siglo XIX. Estos pianos linguisticos van desde "el mas culto y refinado de las clases pudientes" hasta las 54 THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN Fall, 1981</page><page sequence="11">FaIl, 1981 THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN 55 deformaciones fon6ticas del olvidado "negro bozal." 4. Business session. Election of officers. 5. "Establishing a Cogent System for Classifying Medial Consonant Combinations," Robert A. Quinn, Delta State University. (15 min.) The system described in this paper is the result of three years of investigation undertaken in response to the need for an adequate understanding of the most complicated aspect of Spanish phonology: the changes by which medial consonant combinations were resolved during the evolution from Latin to modern Spanish. This paper summarizes how a defensible system for classifying the combinations was developed. Then it thoroughly discusses how the system provides a coherent framework which not only helps us to understand the tendencies shaping the evolving phonology but also clarifies the relationships between those tendencies and the seemingly disparate resolutions. 6. "Argentinismos y cubanismos," BeAtriz Varela, University of New Orleans. (15 min.) Although geographically far apart, the speech of Argentina and that of Cuba share certain traits. This paper studies similarities and differences between Argentine and Cuban euphemisms, archaisms, expressions related to money and delinquency, foreign words and regional idioms. While some of the lexical items analyzed are of obscure origin, many can be traced back to a common Latin, Indian, Hispanic, or Gypsy word. The Argentine terms were gathered during sabbatical leave in Argentina in 1979, and the Cuban expressions in interviews with fifty informants. Humor and perspicacity predominate in all. 7. "Notas Lingifsticas y un cuento de Chambu, Joseph F. V6lez, Baylor University. (15 min.) Ya el tftulo indica dos partes de este trabajo. Ambas reflejan el amor de Guillermo Edmundo Chavez por su patria, Colombia. En el aspecto lingiiistico intento senalar la influencia del quecha y del caribe en la toponimia asi como los modismo regionales y las peculiaridades lingiifsticas del autor. El lenguaje negro es un aspecto esencial de la sequnda parte, el cuento, y el autor lo usa atinadamente para dar credibilidad a sus personajes. Como se vera, el autor presenta el escenario en castellano, pero deja que el dialecto negro presente el drama. FRIDAY AFTERNOON Second Session 4:15-5:45 p.m. ANGLO-IRISH LITERATURE- Colorado Chairman: C. W. Spinks, Trinity University Secretary: Larry Brunner, Hardin-Simmons University 1. "Shaw and the Uses of History," Dan H. Laurence, Advisor to the Shaw Estate. (40 min.) The paper examines Shaw's use of history - particularly in Saint Joan - to evidence that Shaw is as faithful to a concept of accurate history as any playwright who recognizes the need to disenchant an audience of its historical delusions. It explores the use of the Shavian protagonist as an antidote to melodramatic tragedy that would focus on pure victims and villainous forces of repression, and contends that Shaw humanizes the context of history, tragedy, and heroic struggle by complicating the overly-neat historical cliches accepted and embraced by audiences in preference to confrontation with their own history. 2. "Aesthetic Distance in Yeats's 'Leda and the Swan'," Nancy Hargrove, Mississippi State University. (20 min.) Although critic D. S. Savage determines that Yeats's poetry is "too remote," one of the poet's greatest works, "Leda and the Swan," is an example of Yeats's careful balance of intense experience and aesthetic distance. This balance can be seen in every element of the poem - in its subject and theme, its language, its structure, and its technical devices. The poem is firmly grounded in and yet transcends the real world, as it presents the mortal and immortal, the physical and the abstract, the specific moment in time and the broad sweep of a two-thousand- year cycle of human history. 3. Business session. Election of officers. 4. "Literary Criticism Through Art: An Examination of Yeats's Critical Prose," Alice Goodwin. (20 min.) It would seem reasonable that William Butler Yeats would have strong ties with the visual arts, since much of Yeats's informal, early education took place in his father's studio and in the studies of his father's friends. Even after he quite clearly devoted himself to writing, Yeats gave considerable attention to art and theories of art especially in the critical prose. Although his concern with art is increasingly related to literature and the development of his own aesthetic, his critical prose reveals a reliance on the critical methods and standards of the visual arts in the moulding of this aesthetic. APPLIED LINGUISTICS - Trinity Chairman: Margaret M. Marshall, Louisiana State University Secretary: Richard V. Teschner, The University of Texas at El Paso 1. "Cyclicity as a Design Feature of Classroom Testing," Robert A. Fischer, Southwest Texas State University. (20 min.) Language teachers agree that the goal of the foreign language course is communication but frequently overlook the function of classroom testing as an instrument to help achieve that goal. This paper sketches a testing program that more accurately reflects the goal of communicative competence and whose features guide the learner from the acquisition of linguistic competence to the ultimate goal of communicative competence. The proposed testing program consists of a linguistic competence component and a communicative competence component applied in a cyclic manner. The cyclic application of the two components assures the integration of language skills necessary for effective communication. 2. "T-units: A Linguistic Handle on the Twin Conspiracies in Shakespeare's Tempest," James E. Werchan, East Texas State University. (20 min.) While Kellogg W. Hunt developed his T-unit measurement to judge the syntactic maturity of student writing, he himself said it also could be used to study what "a conspicuous stylist does to achieve his special effects." Hunt defines a T-unit as any part of a sentence that "could be terminated ... between a capital letter and a period." T-unit analysis of two speeches by Antonio and Caliban in Shakespeare's Tempest can help in comparing the characters' language and thus can lead to some inferences about their relative mental skills and ability to make abstractions of ideas by using metaphors.

Mejias, Pan American University. (20 min.) The student body of Pan American University constitutes a unique situation since 76% of its students are Spanish/English bilinguals. They do not, however, have a balanced command of all four skills in Spanish. This paper deals with the sociolinguistic factors conditioning the Spanish of the student body at Pan American University and it explains the methods being used in an attempt to improve the reading and writing skills of these bilinguals. 4. Business session. Election of officers. 5. "Strategies for Teaching and Testing Reading," Juan Barroso VIII and Margaret Parker, Louisiana State University. (20 min.) Most beginning foreign language textbooks offer little or no guidance in developing reading skill, yet reading proficiency is crucial to success in third and fourth semester courses. A carefully planned program of intensive guided reading provides the training and establishes the discipline necessary to develop appropriate pronunciation, stress and intonation patterns and recognition of syntactic units. The method can be easily adapted to different textbooks and levels of instruction. Specially designed and administered oral reading examinations test the skill adequately and serve as useful diagnostic tools. ENGLISH IA: Old and Middle English Literature - Parlor D Chairman: Katherine O'Brien O'Keeffe, Texas A&amp;M University Secretary: Zella M. Spiers, Rice University 1. "Patterns of Movement in The Seafarer," Sarah Stevens, University of Texas at Arlington. (12 min.) This paper argues for a discernible pattern of movement, by which the sea becomes a physical setting mirroring a condition of mind, and the realms of heaven and earth operate as forces of attraction and repulsion in the Seafarer's psyche. Patterns of imagery convey the three major motifs: the exile motif provides a horizontal forward motion, and the antithetical themes of the fallen world and the heavenly kingdom create a tension between upward and downward movement. Furthermore, the poet's use of pronouns, as well as the overall structure of the poem, suggests a movement from private to public expression. 2. "Placing the Structure of Judgment Day II in a Spiritual Tradition," P. M. Geoghegan, Angelo State University. (12 min.) Judgment Day II - the translation of Bede's versus de die iudicii - is unique because of the dramatic frame which distinguishes this poem from the typical Latin planctus. A possible exemplar is the particular sermon technique of Ephrem the Syriac, but his influence cannot be proved. The tradition that best explains its dramatic quality is the first and final steps of the Ladder of Humility of the Benedictine Rule whose bare outline is analyzed and elaborated by Gregory the Great in his Moralia. These two works of monastic literature are the spiritual tradition standing behind the Latin and English poems. 3. Business session. Election of officers. 4. "Harry Bailly - Chaucer's Alter Ego?" Mary M. Katzif, Baylor University. (12 min.) Chaucer's fondness for diversity within a unit, evidenced in the Canterbury Tales, suggests that readers can extend his view of himself and see in Harry Bailly striking similarities to the man and poet Geoffrey Chaucer. In the similarities concerned with the historical Chaucer, students notice that the two men resemble each other physically, that they both are of England's middle social class, and that they both are skilled in financial affairs. In those concerned with the artistic Chaucer, readers can see similarities in their genial natures, in their attitudes about art, and in their functions as creators and orderers of the tales. 5. 'The Clerk's Tale: Paradox or Contradiction?" Catherine T. Wildermuth, Southwest Texas State University. (12 min.) This essay examines the narrative strategy of the Clerk's Tale and argues that one consistent moral standard unifies all elements. In particular, the tale illustrates how the moral virtues of humility, patience, and obedience lead man to salvation by removing those impediments in the human personality which can separate him from God. The more irrationally and emotionally impossible readers perceive Walter's tests to be, the more clearly they see that the significance of Griselda's constancy lies in the nature of the response itself. Through this response to the world, man overcomes evil. Such is the paradox of Christianity. 6. "Chaucer's Prioress: The Woman and the Nun," Marda Nicholson Steffey, Rice University. (12 min.) The conflicting claims being made upon Chaucer's Prioress by cultural milieu, emotional needs, and biological reality induce her inconsistencies of character. During childhood, her three possible role models would have been (1) the courtly heroine, an unrealistic but nevertheless attractive notion, (2) the wife and mother, with inherent subservience and fleshly guilt, and (3) the nun, who renounces worldly existence. While consciously accepting notions of masculine ascendency, and sacrificing herself to virginity, her unacknowledged frustration over losing the normal means of compensation for feminine "inferiority" subjects Madame Eglentyne to the repressed hostility and to the desire for forgiveness which emerge in her tale. ENGLISH III: General Topics - San Antonio Chairman: Dennis Vannatta, University of Arkansas at Little Rock Secretary: Phillip Anderson, University of Central Arkansas 1. "Emerson's Nature and English Romanticism," Larry J. Reynolds, Texas A&amp;M University. (20 min.) Emerson's Nature (1836) is indebted to the writings of the English Romantics, particularly Wordsworth and Coleridge. From them Emerson acquired several key ideas such as the divinity of nature, the importance of the individual, the need for spontaneity, the value of organicism, the power of intuition, and the glory of independence; however, he developed, extended, and modified these ideas as he used them in the creation of his own work. An examination of the ways he did so reveals fundamental differences between American Romanticism and its English analogue. 2. "'Come Pull Yourself Together': The Allegory of the Whole Man in A Passage to India," Donn E. Taylor, Wayland Baptist College. (20 min.) One of the central structures in aA Passage to India is an allegory on a traditional theme, man's quest for wholeness or completion ("passage") and his potential for achieving completion by bringing his component faculties into harmonious relationship. Although the novel's chief characters are "round" characters, Forster also gives certain characters a "flat" aspect as allegorical types 58 THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN Fall, 1981</page><page sequence="13">FaIl, 1981 THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN 59 representing man's divided faculties: mind, body, and spirit. These achieve (temporary) completion in the novel's final section. The allegory serves an important critical purpose in that it guides the reader toward determining the degree of pessimism intended in the novel's conclusion. 3. Business session. Election of officers. 4. "The Way That Girl Pressed against You in the Subway: Ronald Sukenick's Real Act of the Imagination," Stanley Trachtenberg, Texas Christian University. (20 min.) Focusing on the framing act of illusion, the postmodern novelist Ronald Sukenick transfers the authority of fiction from the Modernist internal principle of coherence to the fictional surface, where it is responsible to the concrete if accidental compositional act. Sukenick inverts the traditional attempt to encourage the reliability of this act by establishing a surrogate narrator, whose imaginative inventions are, at the same time, concrete structures. They affect the way we perceive other such structures but remain independent of the conventional notions of social circumstance or psychological consistency. Sukenick's characters thus have memories but no history. FRENCH II: Literature Before 1850 - Parlor C Chairman: Rolande L. Leguillon, University of St. Thomas Secretary: James F. Gaines, Southern Louisiana University in Hammond. 1. "Marivaux's La Colonie: In Defense of Women?", Martha G. Bailey, Sam Houston State University. (10 min.) Marivaux wrote La Colonie in the early part of his career. It concerned a group of shipwrecked French citizens who had to write a new constitution for their new situation. The play was a dismal failure, but Marivaux persisted and presented a revised version twenty-one years later for a society theater. This time, it was a polished jewel and carried a much stronger statement about the rights of women. This paper examines the feminist content of the play and discusses the possible reasons for Marivaux's ambiguous support of the women, if, indeed, it was support. 2. "Beaumarchais et le theme de la substitution", Madeleine Alcover, Rice University, (20 min.) Dans la lignee de W. E. Rex qui a vu dans Le Mariage de Figaro, un jeu de cache-cache et de J. Sch6rer, qui y a analyse l'utilisation fonctionnelle du d6cor, la pr6sente 6tude montrera que le theme de la substitution est un leit-motiv dans les deux com6dies de Beaumarchais: substitution d'objets, de personnes dans un meme lieu, de roles, voire de phonemes; ces comedies sont, quant aux jeux, un theme a variations de plus en plus complexes, mais dont la base est un "etre ou ne etre". Plus qu'un jeu de cache-cache, c'est une analyse minutieuse de la composante spatio-temporelle du principe d'identit6 que Beaumarchais nous offre. 3. Business session. Election of officers 4. "Armance: Stendhal's Problem Novel," George M. Rosa, Tulane University. (25 min.) Armance has generally been regarded as a problem novel for a number of reasons, most notably because of its author's failure to make clear the original premise of the work, which is supposed to deal with the problem of the protagonist's sexual impotence, but in fact resolutely avoids doing so - to the point that Stendhal decided to eliminate what was, by his own admission, the sole clear evidence of his hero's disability. The paper argues that it was the very style that Stendhal adopted in attempting to treat the subject of impotence that led him to evade the same subject at the last. 5. "Crime et expiation dans La Mardchale d'Ancre de Vigny," Bernadette Lintz, Rice University. (20 min.) Vigny met en scene un enchainement d'evenements qui mene de l'acte violent, le r6gicide d'Henri IV, a son expiation, le meurtre de Concini et l'execution de la Mar6chale. Au moyen d'une double vengeance, politique et personnelle, Vigny montre que les rapports humains sont fondes sur la violence. A la reflexion sur l'homme s'ajoute une mise au point sur le pouvoir et lajustice. Le pouvoir en place n'est que l'appropriation et la legitimation de la violence, alors que la justice sert tres souvent a ex6cuter des vengeances personnelles. GERMANII: Literature from 1700 to the Death of Goethe - Rio Grande Chairman: Robert Mollenauer, University of Texas at Austin Secretary: Luanne Frank, University of Texas at Arlington 1. "Zur Struktur von Goethes Wanderjahren," Marlis Mehra, University of Houston. (15 min.) Wahrend Goethes friihere Romane sich durch eine geschlossene Form auszeichnen, ist sein letzter Roman Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre durch eine offen Form gekennseichnet, die sich bisher einer definitiven strukturanalyse entzogen hat. Die verschiedensten Strukturmodelle- vom barocken Novellenkranz bis zum modernen nouveau roman- sind bereits zur Interpretation dieser eigenwilligen Romanform herangezogen worden. Ich mochte hier ein neues Interpretationsmodell vorschlagen, dass sich sunachst auf zeitgenossische asthetische Kategorien stiitzt, dann aber die Ergebnisse der heutigen Rezeptionsasthetik auf Goethes Wanderjahre anwendet. 2. "Humboldt and Goethe's Mdrchen: A Generic Interpretation," Katherine Arens, University of Texas at Austin. (15 min.) A continuing interest of Wilhelm von Humboldt was the redefinition of traditional genre canons to provide not prescriptive models for individual genres, but descriptions of the paradigmatic relationships between presentational modes and readers' minds of the organizational categories representative of particular genres. Examining Goethe's Marchen in this light suggests that this literary fairy tale, conceived as "bedeutend aber zugleich deutungslos," is itself a generic paradigm, delineating the figure types, settings, and magical transformations which constitute the ideal, underlying morphology of its genre. 3. Business session. Election of Officers. 4. "Schlechte Lektiire im Zeitalter der Aufklarung: Ideologie und Mythos," Fred J. Backhaus, Midwestern University. (12 min.) Die spatmittelalterliche Verdammung von "unniitzer," "sundhafter," "verlogenen" Literatur wird von der Aufklarung uneingeschrankt ubernommen und durch Schlagworte wie "staats-schadlich," "unverniinftig," "Zerst6rung des nationalen GewerbefleiBes"erweitert. Das Lesen von verderblichen Romanen und politischen Schriften wurde als nationales Problem und Massenmasochismus angesehen. Die Verurteilung enzeln aufgefuhrter Schriften wird zur Gefahr einer unbestimmten Gruppe von Lesestoffen aufgebauscht, deren wahlloser Konsum eine Abspannung der Seelenkrafte hervorrufe. Die aufklarerisch-utilitaristische Ideologie von der Zerstorung des nationalen GewerbefleiBes durch miiuiggangerische Lekturen verband sich mit der mittelalterlichen Ablehnung von THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN 59 Fall, 1981</page><page sequence="14">60_ THE SOT ETALBLEI Fl,18 Friday Afteroon Continued sundhafter Literatur zu einem Meinungsmonopol, das sich auf popularer Ebene manifestierte und dem unmundigen Volk die Idee vom "schlechten Buch" einhammerte. 5. "Holderlin's Confrontation with the Paradoxical Reality of Heraclitus," Meredith McClain, Texas Tech University. (12 min.) During Holderlin's enforced separation from his beloved Diotima, he was increasingly concerned with a philosophical working out of the vicissitudes of reality- the incessant interplay of love and strife. It is evident from his work during this period on the Empedocles drama that he was probing that philosophy which finds the ultimate principle of the universe to be alternation between opposites. The paper proposes to document Holderlin's turning from this concept toward the paradoxical reality of Heraclitus and to show how this refined philosophical change affected Holderlin's poetic expression. 6. "Sex as Threat, Sex as Therapy: Christian Kriiger, C. M. Wieland, and a Typology of Titillation for the Enlightenment," John W. Van Cleve, Mississippi State University. (12 min.) Consideration of two works spanning the middle period of the German Enlightenment can establish the poles of a continuum of response to matters sexual. In Christian Kriger'sDie Geistlichen aufdemLande (1743), intimacy as a danger opens the door to male-dominated discussions of both religiosity and male/female roles with and without benefit of enlightenment. In Wieland's Musarion (1768), sex joins forces with reason in the struggle against dehumanizing attitudes and beliefs. While Wieland still plays the teacher, the fervor of Kriger has passed; sex no longer figures in a cry for social change. PORTUGUESE-BRAZILIAN - Parlor A Chairman: Peter J. Lunardini, Louisiana State University Secretary: Maria Duke dos Santos, East Texas State University 1. "Portuguese Phonology: Rumanian Structure in Metaphony," Michael D. Powers, Louisiana State University (15 min.) Malkiel (1981) has suggested a mixture of two dialects being favored by certain environments around the third or fourth century A.D. in the older layers of Spanish and Portuguese in which C. L. short ui,V.L. open V and not V.L. close 9, thus paralleling Rumanian. Methaphonic evidence which implies that there was a qualitative difference between Old Portuguese final "-o" and the final "-os" upon examination of nouns and adjectives of C. L. radical short 6 lends support to this hypothesis in light of lexical diffusion. 2. "A Primeira Flor: Uma Vis&amp;o do Adolescente em Dois Contos de Machado de Assis," Miguel Jo&amp;o Sobrinho, Tulane University. (15 min.) Esse trabalho 6 um estudo comparativo entre dois contos - "Uns Bragos" e "Missa do Galo" - em que Machado de Assis focaliza o desabrochar da sensualidade em um adolescente. Al6m da estrutura edipiana dos contos, 6 relevante como o autor utiliza seu estilo para criar um clima nebuloso e sugestivo. Uma hipn6tica sonol6ncia envolve as personagens principais parecendo transporti-las para um terceiro plano de consciencia situado entre o sonho e a realidade. Dessa maneira, o estilo de Machado evoca e amplia o tema da descoberta do amor na adolescencia corn suas inquietudes, hesitagoes, temores e incertezas. 3. "A Carnavaliza0ao Fora do Lugar: Machado de Assis e Mikhail Bakhtine," Enylton de SA Rego, University of Texas at Austin. (15 min.) Uma recente tendencia de reavaliagao n&amp;o s6 da obra machadiana como tambem do pr6prio conceito de literatures nacionais latino-americanas esta em andamento, tendencia na qual os aspectos "satira" e "par6dia" do texto de um romance ganham crescente proeminencia. Neste trabalho tentamos mostrar que a obra machadiana pode ser vista como uma par6dia radical da linguagem da literatura ocidental de seu momento hist6rico, como uma satira nao s6 da sociedade mas da pr6piia literatura como convencao artistica e forma de percepc&amp;o da realidade. Nela se encontrariam algumas das caracteristicas apontadas por Mikhail Bakhtine como as forcas criadoras de genero "romance" na literatura ocidental: "dialogismo," "polifonia" e "carnavalizacao." 4. "The Antichrist in Vila Feliz," Almir de Campos Bruneti, Tulane University. (15 min.) The short story "Acontecimento em Vila Feliz," published by Anfbal Machado in 1944, is typical of the production of this "escritor classico" of Brazilian letters. By means of his unique style and through the use of subtle and masterful psychological insight the author is able to indict a whole community when the most beautiful and most envied woman in town literally, and symbolically, gives birth to a pile of stones. 5. "A Intertextualidade da Vanguarda: Antonio Ferro e o Modernismo Brazileiro," Kenneth David Jackson, University of Texas at Austin. (15 min.) The paper studies theoretical and textual relationships between the novels, chronicles, and essays of the Portuguese vanguardist Ant6nio Ferro and certain novels and manifestoes of Brazilian Modernism, particularly those of Oswald de Andrade. From a view of the cultural context of these Luso-Brazilian vanguardist groups, through the Parisian literary and artistic circles frequented by both Ant6nio Ferro and Oswald de Andrade as well as Ant6nio Ferro's conferences and publications in Brazil during the early 1920's, the aesthetic interrelationships between the two movements will be focused through specific textual comparisons. As a conclusion, Oswald de Andrade's work as a vanguardist can be shown to have a greater universality than commonly assumed and the contact between Portuguese futurism and Brazilian Modernism more decisive than shown in current scholarship. 6. "Almeida Faria's Cortes as Thematic and Stylistic Bridge," Jack E. Tomlins, University of New Mexico. (15 min.) The second novel of Jose de Almeida Faria's trilogy -A Paixao (1965), Cortes (1978) andLusitdnia (1980)- is here read as the bridge between the Portugal prior to the 1974 revolution and post-revolutionary Portugal, represented in the trilogy by Lusitdnia. Apart from the thematics of tradition versus revolution, this paper also investigates the continuation of Almeida Faria's highly personal poetic style, his use of the instantdneo, his employment of montage in the fixing of the eternal portrait of an Alentejo forever altered by the radicality of revolution. 7.

Tate, Texas Christian University Secretary: Phillip Parotti, Sam Houston State University. 1. "John Donne's Scholastic Style," Joyce S. Beck, University of Texas at Arlington. (20 min.) John Donne's verse epistles to the Countess of Bedford exemplify a sophisticated literary style in which theological themes or subjects are articulated fully through a scholastic methodology. In several of these epistles, the principle of universal analogy or correspondence is the basis for a stylistic elaboration of Donne's subject, the Lady Bedford's virtue, through amplificatio and digressio and in lesser known tropes or figures of thought such as expeditio, metanoia, paralipsis, catacosmesis, tapinosis, and anthypophora. Donne's style in these letters, like his invention and arrangement, is sophisticated, discursive, and scholastic. 2. "Chaucer's Use of Rhetoric in Relation to Structure and Meaning in TheParliament ofFowls" Dorothy R. Castle, Texas Woman's University. (18 min.) A brief analysis of Chaucer's technique of arrangement, organization, amplification, and abbreviation in The Parliament of Fowls reveals a close connection between structure and meaning and lends support to the theory that the poet put his own stamp of genius on the rhetorical tools available to him in the fourteenth century. The poet employs various rhetorical devices to emphasize the point that both love and the art of poetry are difficult crafts to learn; the rhetorical tapestry that he weaves reveals the complex nature of the relationship between structure and meaning. 3. Business session. Election of officers. 4. "The Gift of Prometheus: Another Look at Invention," Kathleen Hudson, Texas Christian University. (20 min.) Speculations upon the creative processes of invention, which may range from inspiration through revery to dawdling, when informed by the observations upon their own inventive processes by professional writers- as recorded in various interviews and especially in magazines for writers - generate possible practical guides to invention for use in freshman composition classes. 5. "From an Undisclosed Past into an Unknown Future." Jim W. Corder, Texas Christian University. (15 min.) The types of rhetoric described in antiquity and still often preserved in our own texts in our own language - judicial rhetoric, epideictic rhetoric, and legislative rhetoric - afford a vocabulary and a method for describing certain failures, real or perceived, in the behavior of university administrators, the consequent distrust awakened among faculty, and the pattern of failure and distrust that works the other way round. The language and focus associated with these types of rhetoric also suggest some guides, not toward infallibility and perfect trust, but toward some modest beginnings of authentic discourse between these parties, if parties they must be. RUSSIAN LITERATURE - Parlor B Chairman: Michal Barszap, Texas A&amp;M University Secretary: Marjorie Rudolph, University of Arkansas at Fayetteville 1. "A Consideration of the Door as a Symbol in Crime and Punishment," Eleanor B. Howes, Nicholls State University. (20 min.) By taking an ordinary object, the door, and using it extensively as a symbol, Dostoevsky stresses the inherent irrationality of Raskolnikov's actions in Crime and Punishment. Doors frame dramatic episodes in the novel and ironically reveal or betray what they should conceal or protect. As Raskolnikov seeks to understand the forces which motivate him, he opens door after door of confrontations with other protagonists in the novel. Only after the doors of the Siberian prison close behind him does Raskolnikov reach the end of his search and begin to feel free. 2. "Dostoyevskij's Conception of Freedom in Notes From the Underground," Roger D. Follis, Vanderbilt University. (20 min.) Dostoyevskij denied Jeremy Bentham's utilitarianism and the position that human actions can be predicted according to the laws of nature like mathematical logarithms. He maintained that the utilitarians ignored the most important feature about the human mind: that freedom is more dear to man than material self-interest. Dostoyevskij's underground man is not unlike Camus' character Meursault in The Stranger and Sartre's character Roquentin in Nausea in terms of man's alienation and freedom. Freedom, according to Dostoyevskij, is an essential attribute of man's identity. Dostoyevskij's underground man is totally free and carries revolt against limitation to its extreme. Like the existentialists who would follow, Dostoyevskij was faced with a seemingly irresolvable dilemma: "Freedom is the supreme good because man is not man unless he is free, but freedom is also a supreme evil because man is free to do anything, including illimitable destruction." 3. "A Re-examination ofMixail Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita," Janet G. Tucker, University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. (20 min.) The spectacular appearance of Bulgakov's long-hidden masterpiece, The Master and Margarita, inspired a number of articulate and sensitive critical essays. In addition to analyses of Bulgakov's novel as a continuator of the Faust legend, the work has been examined as myth and its place within Soviet literature has been probed. Besides such interpretation, however, The Master and Margarita can be linked with the Christianity and anti-Determinism found in Dostoevskij, particularly in his masterpiece The Brothers Karamazov and most specifically in the chapter entitled "The Legend of the Grand Inquisitor." By juxtaposing The Brothers Karamazov with The Master and Margarita, we see similar renunciations of the temporal and banal for the entenal and significant. Bulgakov's novel exposes the hollow temporality of the Soviet system and stresses, as did Dostoevskij's work, that human behavior is intrinsically independent of any temporal philosophical strictures. 4.

Taylor, Southern University in New Orleans Secretary: Shirley H. Wright, Wiley College 1. "Cable's Handling of the Mutilated Black Prince in The Grandissimes," Bernice Larson Webb, University of Southwestern Louisiana. (15 min.) George Washington Cable, exiled from his native South because of his liberal views on black-white relations, made his polemical opinions clear in his non-fiction works The Silent South (1885) and The Negro Question (1890). Earlier, however, he used fiction to convey in less explicit terms his antipathy against the brutalities of black existence. In The Grandissimes (1880), for example, he gives to his serious intent a varied overlay. Stylistic methods employed in reporting the dehumanizing treatment of the enslaved black prince in Chapter 28 ("The Story of Bras-Coupe") include ironic understatement, comic-opera burlesque, and sentimental melodrama. 2. 'The Black Sermon as Literature: The Colloquial Style of C. C. Lovelace and John Jasper vs. the Formalistic Style of Benjamin Mays," Doris L. Gavins, Dillard University. (15 min.) The sermons of C. C. Lovelace and John Jasper are characterized by sheer force of language, a display of verbal fireworks mingling the vernacular with wild metaphors, the integration of commonplace experience juxtaposed with historical action, a blend of idiomatic expressions with the language of the Bible, and the juxtaposition of intemperate allusions with moral platitudes. Their colloquial style is just the opposite of the formalistic style of Benjamin May's sermons, where he follows the classical Aristotelian mode of expression. 3. "No Day ofTriumph: The Search for Black Identity in the Autobiography of J. Saunders Redding," Mary Williams Burger, University of Maryland. (20 min.) In the first half of the century, J. Saunders Redding was one of several writers who provided political and intellectual leadership while serving as "Griots" of black life. In the aftermath of the Great Depression and World War II, Redding creates a sensitive, often painful portrait of blacks in search of a place in America. His penetrating characterizations probe values in black life that seemed lost, denied, or forgotten. In theme and structure, therefore, his autobiography is itself a search: a literary journey through the moral drives and spiritual values which give black people a past and a future. 4. Business session. Election of officers. 5. "'The Black Christ': A Manifestation of Racial and Religious Pride," Isaac W. Brumfield, Southern University in New Orleans. (20 min.) Written in Paris in 1928, Countee Cullen's poem, "The Black Christ," gives evidence of his fertile, creative mind imbued with doubt as to the place and purpose of Christianity in Black life. Just as important as the religious issue is Cullen's awareness of racial identity. More specifically, the poem raises questions regarding social criticism of America in addition to those of race and religion. As a result of this threefold emphasis, the poem stands as Cullen's most sustained and ambitious attempt in poetry to merge the American Black man's racial and religious identities. 6. "Wright's Religious Quest: Bigger's Deconstruction in Native Son," William J. Barnette, Austin Peay State University. (20 min.) Bigger Thomas' characterization in Native Son has often been viewed as an artistic failure. Both Robert Bone and Michel Fabre have criticized Wright's portrayal of Bigger as an unsuccessful attempt to combine elements of Dreiser's Clyde Griffith and Dostoyevsky's Raskolnikov within one fictional character. This criticism seems rather questionable. Rather than trying to fit Bigger into the molds of European fiction or the naturalistic novel, a preferable approach underscores the religious quest undeniably present in Bigger's characterization. Actually Bigger embodies both the Yahweh/prophetic character of the Old Testament and the Christ/messianic makeup of the New Testament. AMERICAN LITERATURE I: Literature Before 1900 - Trinity Chairman: Thomas W. Ford, University of Houston Secretary: Mary Ann Wimsatt, Southwest Texas State University 1. "Tombless Virtue and Hidden Text: New England Puritan Funeral Elegies," William J. Scheick, University of Texas at Austin. (20 min.) Although no paradigm of the Puritan elegy emerges, after 1660 several elegies concerned with ministers focus inwardly upon the collective self of the isolated colonial community. The manifestation of this collective self, saintly virtue, is not entombed and becomes the true monument of elegy. Seeking no lasting identity for themselves as artistic monuments, elegiac texts transfer to the soul of their audience, to the hidden text or tombstone of the self. Thus, the celebrated selflessness of the deceased (the nominal subject), conveyed through a selfless prophetic voice in a selfless text, points to the ideal selflessness of the audience (the actual subject). 2. "Picturesque Landscape as Metaphor in Edgar Huntly," Dennis Berthold, Texas A&amp;M University. (20 min.) The frontier landscape of Edgar Huntly derives as much from late eighteenth-century English theories of picturesque beauty as from a realistic portrayal of the American wilderness. As a magazine editor, Brown stimulated American taste for picturesque scenery, and in his fourth novel exploited the descriptive conventions in the travel writings of William Gilpin, Ann Radcliffe, and Albanis Beaumont to frame the tension between savagery and civilization and create a topographical metaphor for the stable psychological state his romantic hero seeks. 3. "A. B. Longstreet: Realist and Artist," James B. Meriwether, University of South Carolina. (20 min.) The time is ripe for a re-evaluation of Augustus Baldwin Longstreet, who once seemed to be one of the best-known, best-understood of the group of ante-bellum Southern writers we usually, and inaccurately, lump together as "Southwestern Humorists." Too narrow a focus on his total accomplishment has been the result of the frequent republication of such excerpts from Georgia Scenes as 'The Horse-swap" and "The Fight." His primary mode was realism, not humor; and both the variety and the literary sophistication of the best of his fictional sketches and short stories are underrated. 62 THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN Fall, 1981</page><page sequence="17">FaIl, 1981 THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN 63 4. "Miles Coverdale's Singular Vision in The Blithedale Romance," Sarah Morgan, Southwest Texas State University. (15 min.) The seemingly needless ambiguity of The Blithedale Romance is actually central to the romance's theme. Coverdale's narrative must be ambiguous and Coverdale must seem unreliable, for in the novel Hawthorne duplicates the process by which one orders past experience. Hawthorne shows the effects time, desire, and memory have on the interpretation of a past reality. Thus, the novel's ambiguity both defines the area between truth and fantasy in which reality is perceived and clarifies the subjectivity of all such perceptions. 5. Business session. Election of officers. 6. "From Brooklyn Bard to Maryland Myth: Emerson's Poet and Whitman's Christ," Jerome Loving, Texas A&amp;M University. (20 min.) Unlike the Myth of Amherst, the Myth of Maryland came about systematically as a result of Walt Whitman's skillful promotion of his works and his disciples' attempts at apotheosis. And the Christic image of the Good Gray Poet was the only pose Whitman could assume once he had fallen out of the role of Emerson's poet. No longer the anguished bard of Leaves of Grass (1855-1860), Whitman retired to a Maryland farmhouse to become a messiah of sorts - leading his readers on "a passage to more than India!" 8. "Four Old Smokers: Melville, Thoreau, and Their Chimneys," Pamela R. Matthews, Texas A&amp;M University. (15 min.) Verbal echoes of Thoreau's Walden in Melville's "I and My Chimney" suggest that Melville used Walden as a starting point for his sketch, which is, at least in part, an expression of Melville's ambivalent attitude toward transcendentalism. The usual critical opinion of Melville as satiric is certainly evident. But more important, Melville's strong attraction to transcendentalism is apparent as well, most evident in the contrast between the narrator and his wife. Ultimately, "I and My Chimney" asserts that a balance between the extreme optimism of transcendentalism and the opposite nihilistic extreme must be achieved. 9. "Two More Turns of the Screw," Kenneth W. Staggs, Trinity University. (15 min.) The Turn of the Screw contains two references to specific novels of the eighteenth century, The Mysteries of Udolpho and Amelia. Although they may be considered merely decorative, an examination of the two novels sheds light on the character of the governess and James's structuring of his tale. The literary qualities of the governess's manuscript, together with these allusions, show that she characterizes hereself as a heroine of sensibility in a gothic tale. However, the emphasis on love and seduction, innocence and deception in both Amelia and Udolpho reinforces the essential ambiguity of her role and the tale. ENGLISH IIB: Eighteenth-Century Literature - Rio Grande Chairman: Retta M. Taney, Xavier University of Louisiana Secretary: Robert C. Olson, Lamar University 1."'Yet will I trust in Him': Goldsmith's The Vicar of Wakefield," John Irwin Fischer, Louisiana State University. (25 min.) In the opening chapters of The Vicar of Wakefield its hero, Dr. Primrose, appears to have mastered the art of doing well by doing good, for in his actions the competing claims of worldliness and piety seem to have been harmonized. The harmony Dr. Primrose has achieved, however, is as reductionistic as is his favorite heterodoxy, Whiston's doctrine of clerical monogamy. By exposing the inadequacy of Dr. Primrose's early responses to the world, Goldsmith's book allows us to appreciate the lesson that Dr. Primrose himself learns near the close of his adventures: "To religion then we must hold in every circumstance of life for our truest comfort." 2. "The Meaning of Non-Meaning: Rochester's 'Upon Nothing,'" G. Jack Gravitt, Southwest Texas State University. (8 min.) In "Upon Nothing" (1679), John Wilmot does for "nothing" what Erasmus does for folly; Rochester ironically examines the positive implications or "somethingness" of nothing. Though filled with satire, the poem employs an anti-Aristotelian structure to pose the paradox of reason's inability to deal with the void of nothing. Here the speaker of "Upon Nothing" prefigures the Jack of Swift's Tale of a Tub; both must fend off this void and both would make something from nothing. Thus the paradox continues as "something" implicitly "ever end[s]" in nothing. 3. "Poetic and Musical Satire in Pope's Essay on Criticism and Mozart's A Musical Joke," Richard Gage, Louisiana State University. (20 min.) Music and poetry are sister arts. From ancient Greece through the Middle Ages and into the Enlightenment, thinkers have known music and speech were systems of sound with both analyzable parts and "correspondences." This paper analyzes portions of Mozart's A Musical Joke and Pope's Essay on Criticism to illustrate such musical-poetic correspondences. Both artists attack hacks in their fields, demolishing pretensions to art by imitating and parodying "tricks of the trade" and trite content. Although their methods are similar, differences appear as well. Noting the Horatian injunction that artists delight and instruct, it appears Mozart emphasized delighting, Pope instructing. 4. "'Ceres in Her Harvest': The Exploded Myths of Womanhood in George Farquhar's The Beaux' Stratagem," Sue Kimball, Methodist College. (22 min.) While most critics have assumed that Farquhar's The Beaux' Stratagem was a statement in favor of divorce and a reflection of the playwright's dissatisfaction with his own marriage, the play is instead a tribute to women. It debunks the following myths: (1) It's a man's world. (2) Woman's place is in the home, her purpose the rearing of children. (3) Women are vain and frivolous. (4) It is unnatural for a woman to display interest in sex. (5) A woman surrenders her legal rights with marriage. (6) Women are not to be trusted. (7) A woman should be seen and not heard. (8) Woman has no alternative to an unsatisfactory marriage. 5. "Imagery in Samuel Johnson's Rasselas," Jo Hall Church, Texas Woman's University. (20 min.) Endless criticism of Samuel Johnson's Rasselas consideres the work to be a fruitless search for happiness as it terminates in abject pessimism without resolution. This paper disagrees with this criticism by considering aspects of the book which have previously been unexpanded: Johnson's emotional state concerning the loss of his mother at the time he was writing the book, his deeply religious nature, and his profound use of imagery. Through this interpretation, Imlac, the archetypal Christ-figure, leads Rasselas and his sister from their "Happy Valley," or limbo, through experience, the outside world of man, to wisdom and eternity. THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN 63 Fall, 1981</page><page sequence="18">64 THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN FaIl, 1981 Saturday Morning Continued 6. Business session. Election of officers. 7. "'The Stuff of Which Our Dream is Wrought': Uses of Shakespeare in Pope's Epistle to Cobham," C. Earl Ramsey, University of Arkansas at Little Rock. (20 min.) More skeptical than most of Pope's work, the Epistle to Cobham (1734) remains one of the least understood and least valued of his important poems. More than is usual in Pope, To Cobham insists upon the uncertainty of human knowledge and the inconsistency of human character. Two allusions to Shakespeare early in the poem - one to Troilus and Cressida and the other to The Tempest - control its overall design. These two allusions significantly reinforce the poem's skeptical tendencies, but they also help locate what the poem positively, if guardedly, values. ENGLISH V: Contemporary Literature - Brazos Chairman: Jeff H. Campbell, Midwestern State University Secretary: Richard Tuerk, East Texas State University 1. "Setting in The Power and the Glory," Paul Lister, Sul Ross State University. (20 min.) In The Power and the Glory, Graham Greene uses setting as an integral part of the drama of the whiskey priest. The center of the novel is the difficult progress of the whiskey priest from a state of pride and hypocrisy to one of charity, and Greene uses setting to show how life in a hostile environment can temper the priest's character in order to make him a holier man. Also, to amplify his theme, Greene employs foils - five characters, or groups of characters, whose reactions to the Tabascan setting contrast with that of the whiskey priest. 2. "Charles Tomlinson and the 'American Idiom' of William Carlos Williams," Michael Hennessy, Southwest Texas State University. (14 min.) Charles Tomlinson, one of the few postwar British poets to acknowledge the technical achievements of American poetry, has expressed particular admiration for William Carlos Williams. His 1963 collection, A Peopled Landscape, contains several poems imitating Williams's staggered tercet form. Tomlinson's use of this form revitalizes his poetry in two ways: (1) It extends his interest in visual perception, helping him "avoid the genre of literary still life." (2) It introduces a conversational flexibility missing in his early work. Williams leads Tomlinson towards a style that is flexible, yet disciplined enough to allow for the precision and control which characterize his best poetry. 3. "Self-Deprecation in Contemporary American Poetry," Angela Ball, University of Southern Mississippi. (15 min.) This paper analyzes the phenomenon of self-deprecation in contemporary American poetry: its origins, manifestations, and implications. Poems which adopt the self-deprecatory mode make explicit mention of failings or failures - shortcomings both artistic and personal. The poems of James Wright serve as central examples, supplemented by quotations from Mark Strand, Donald Hall, Richard Hugo, and others. 4. "Saul Bellow's Tricksters: Dr. Tamkin and King Dahfu," Molly Stark Wieting, Houston Baptist University. (20 min.) In his search for order, the Bellow hero struggles with "reality instructors" who try to convert him to their versions of truth. Among these characters there is almost always one who instructs or helps the hero and yet who also dupes him. This character, it may be suggested, is a contemporary version of the primitive trickster, one of the oldest and most perplexing mythological figures. By examining the roles of Tamkin in Seize the Day and Dahfu in Henderson the Rain King, the reader can recognize the function of the trickster in the other novels and gain a deeper understanding of Bellow's fiction. 5. Business session. Election of officers. 6. "Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.: Jailbird or Phoenix?" Mark Busby, Texas A&amp;M University. (20 min.) In Palm Sunday Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. rates Jailbird as his best novel since Slaughterhouse-Five. A comparison of the two novels reveals that the two main characters are similar, each working for a transcendent act. For Billy Pilgrim it comes when he begins preaching the truth he thinks he learned on Tralfamadore. Walter Starbuck's only significant human act comes after a long, undistinguished career; it results from writing his "autobiography" and feeling again his own failures counterpointed to Sacco and Vanzetti's sacrifices and Christ's Sermon on the Mount. 7. "Patterns of Character in Gate's The Wheel of Love," Sue Park, West Texas State University. (15 min.) The epigraph for the title story in Joyce Carol Oates's collection of short stories The Wheel of Love might well be used to suggest the theme of the entire volume: "Some must break / Upon the wheel of Love, but not the strange, / The secret lords, whom only death can change." Characters from two stories are used to illustrate the presence of the victims broken on the wheel of love and of the "secret lords" who victimize them. Love, in these stories, is destructive more often than not. 8. "Brennschluss," Barbara Huval, Lamar University. (18 min.) In Thomas Pynchon's novel Gravity's Rainbow, Brennschluss is a dominant and continuing symbol. Brennschluss is the peak of the V-2 rocket's trajectory, the moment of transition between the rocket controlled by man and the rocket in the grip of earth's gravity. People also have their Brennschluss in this novel - Franz Pokier, Tchitcherine, Lyle Bland, and Gottfried each have a climactic moment of transition in their lives, after which they are in some way irrevocably changed. Although Bland and Gottfried "die," Pynchon hints that there is something else on the other side of the Brennschluss of death. 9. "John Hawkes's Triad: Narrator as Artist-Figure," Carol A. MacCurdy, University of Southwestern Louisiana. (18 min.) After Second Skin, John Hawkes extends his exploration of the first-person narrator as artist-figure in a triad of novels, The Blood Oranges (1971), Death, Sleep &amp; the Traveler (1974), and Travesty (1976). With each succeeding novel Hawkes goes a step farther in banishing the rational external world and in concentrating on the interiorjourney into the psyche. Yet, as he charts the narrator's inner migration, the outcome becomes increasingly ambivalent, for the unconscious ultimately offers both freedom and annihilation. Each novel in the triad explores this artistic dilemma and illuminates the nightmarish as well as comic results. FRENCH III: Literature after 1850 - Colorado Chairman: Leon B. Phillips, Jr., Trinity University Secretary: John R. Williams, University of Kansas 1. "Le Post-scriptum de ma vie de Victor Hugo et la dialectique romantique du sujet-objet," Selma A. Zebouni, Louisiana State University. (20 min.) Le Romantisme n'est pas seulement expression du moi, il est 6galement recherche de la v6rite, a travers le moi. La conscience, constitute par l'exp6rience de l'Autre (le THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN 64 Fall, 1981</page><page sequence="19">FaIl, 1981 THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN 65 monde-objet), a son tour structure cet autre en y decouvrant "le sens". Ce rapport dialectique entre le moi-sujet et le monde-objet fonde l'epistemologie romantique, et surtout, entre autres, celle de Victor Hugo C'est dans LePost-scriptum de ma vie que Hugo proclame le r6le du poete chercheur de verite, en fonction pr6cisement de la dialectique romantique du sujet-objet. Le poete accede a l"'extra humain" en regardant en soi. 2. "The Window as Symbol in Adrienne Mesurat," Kathryn E. Wildgen, University of New Orleans. (15 min.) Julien Green's insistence on the importance of visualizing his novels is expressed frequently in both his novels and his essays. Furthermore he qualifies this vision as being "like a theatrical representation". This process is represented extraordinarily well in Adrienne Mesurat in which the character, Adrienne, is a forceful image, sustained throughout the novel, of the artist in the act of creating. When Adrienne begins to daydream, fabricating situations that only partially exist in the "real" world, she is in the role of the author. 3. "Henri Ceard: poete licencieux," Martin Schwarz, University of Tulsa. (20 min.) Des trois medanistes mineurs, Henri Ceard est celui qui possede le talent le plus sfir et la plus grande erudition. Dedaigneux de ses contemporains, il ne publia qu'une petite partie de ce qu'il ecrivit. Ainsi, d'une vaste production p6etique, il ne reste aujourd'hui que quelques rares manuscrits dont l'un - pour des raisons de bienseance - fut sous scelle? pendant plus de trente ans. Pourtant, les ballades scatologiques de Ceard revelent un disciple g6nial de Villon, et conferent a l'auteur d'Une belle journee un nouveau titre de gloire. 4."Salacrou's L'Inconnue d'Arras: Innovation and Inconsistency," Nina C. Ekstein, Trinity University. (25 min.) This paper deals with one of Armand Salacrou's better-known plays, L'lnconnue d'Arras, in which a man relives his life in the instant between when he shoots himself and his death. The representation of the essence of a man's life in a three-act play poses a number of problems because of the wide number of constraints and options present in such an undertaking. This paper examines these problems, discussing how the flashback is organized, what principles direct it, and how the numerous contradictions, inconsistencies, and theatrical innovations finally broaden both the audience's conception of theater and our understanding of this man. 5. Business session. Election of officers. 6. "Pouponne et Balthazar de Madame Sidonie de la Houssaye: L'Experience Acadienne en Louisiane," May Rush Gwin Waggoner, University of Southwestern Louisiana. (16 min.) Certains descendants des colons fran;ais nes dans les colonies americaines nous ont legue une somme d'ecrits que l'on commence maintenant a redecouvrir. Pouponne et Balthazar de Madame Sidonie de la Houssaye, nouvelle publiee en 1888 a New Orleans, fut inspiree en partie par "Evangeline" de Longfellow. L'auteur y 6tale un parti pris violent contre les Anglais et quelques prejuges contre les Acadiens, bien que pour ceux-ci elle manifeste une certaine affection. Pouponne et Balthazar reste un document qui atteste a l'esprit indomptable des Acadiens et reflete les differentes facettes d'une culture qui est le patrimoine litteraire de la Louisiane. 7. "Le Journal d'un cure de campagne: Archetypal Journey to Self-Acceptance," Donald R. Vidrine, North Texas State University. (20 min.) The spiritual crisis of the protagonist in Bernanos' Le Journal d'un cure de campagne follows the archetypal pattern of the descent into hell or the dark night journey. The protagonist labors mightily to shed his staggering burden of self-contempt, succeeding only in the last moments of his anguished life. His voyage into the night and emergence therefrom are recorded in terms of three metaphors: the journey (an inner journey as recorded in the diary), darkness, and light. GERMAN III: Literature since 1832- Nueces Chairman: Robert B. Dewell, Loyola University Secretary: Stephen H. Garrin, University of Texas at Austin 1. "A Study of 'Vertauschbarkeit' in Book Three of Bekenntnisse des Hochstaplers Felix Krull," Peter Ryder, Rice University. (25 min.) No abstract available. 2. "Another Look at the Communication-Crisis in Hofmannsthal's Der Schwierige," Glenn A. Guidry, University of California at Berkeley. (20 min.) This paper provides a new perspective on the communication-crisis in the play by shifting the study of language as an ontological entity to one that emphasizes the act of speech itself. Thus, the main issue in the play becomes, not a matter of Sprachskepsis, but rather a question of ethics. The paper draws further implications for the study of language in Hofmannsthal's entire literary output, as well as in nineteenth- and twentieth-century German literature as a whole. 3. "Rilkes Arme und Ausgestossene," Walter Hartmann, University of Toronto. (20 min.) In recent years, Rilke's reputation has risen sharply in the East-European countries. More and more, his socially inclined side is being discovered there, a side which had never been questioned in the Western Germanistik. This paper deals with the question whether Rilke's personal attitude towards the poor and outcasts of society did find its way into his lyrical works. The fact that Rilke never did take a determined stance towards either rich or poor in his poem will be proven by using a selection of his poems and the results stemming from these findings will then be discussed. 4. Business session. Election of officers. 5. "Elemental Leitmotive in Theodor Fontane's Irrungen Wirrungen," Vance Bass, University of Texas at Austin. (15 min.) This paper is a discussion of Fontane's use of the four medieval elements as leitmotive in Irrungen Wirrungen. These elements are identified with various characters in the novel in order to articulate personal relationships and establish a heirarchy of social and political values which are never overtly stated in the narrative voice. The elements air and water are examined in detail as keys to understanding the relationship between Botho and Lene, and between each of them and their eventual spouses. This viewpoint reveals a social-political commentary only hinted at on the surface level of the narrative. 6. "Kunstkritik, Kunsttheorie und -praxis in Thomas Manns Doktor Faustus," Karlheinz Hasselbach, Tulane University. (25 min.) No abstract available.

Lewis, The University of Texas at Fall, 1981 THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN 65</page><page sequence="20">FaIl, 1981 THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN 67 Saturday Morning Continued Austin. (20 min.) Como otras "historias verdaderas" de las Indias escritas en el siglo XVI, La relacion que dio Alvar Nfuez Cabeza de Vaca de lo acaescido en las Yndias... va dedicade al Rey con en6rgicas afirmaciones sobre su caracter veridico. Aparecen, sin embargo, en el texto de los Naufragios una serie de acontecimientos "maravillosos" que tienden a minar la verosimilitud de 6ste, aun segun los criterios de la 6poca, como el autor mismo parece reconocer. El interes del elemento "maravilloso" radica no s61o en la fisonomia muy particular que 6ste confiere al texto, sino tambien en la honda compenetraci6n de realidades culturales y espiriturales que testimonia. 2. "Pablo Neruda; Espdna en su coraz6n," Shirley Mangini Gonzalez, Yale University. (20 min.) Pablo Neruda fue una figura clave en la actividad cultural de la Espafia de los afios 30. Con el advanimiento de la guerra civil, Neruda abandona su estilo vanguardista para emplear su pluma en tareas mas eticas, para llorar la tragedia espafiola en Tercera residencia, y sobre todo en Espdna en el coraz6n. En esta obra Neruda revela su profunda preocupaci6n por el pais y su sentimiento de amistad y solidaridad con los poetas espafioles. De sumo interes es studiar su influencia en la cultura espanola de los afios 30 y, asimismo, indagar en el impacto que esa Espafia del caos tuvo para la obra de Neruda a partir de la guerra civil. 3. "Babel Revisited: A Short Meditation on Language, Literature, and the Spaces Between a propos of Borges," Carmen M. Del Rio, Louisiana State University. (20 min.) Incapable of knowing the world, man resorts to his only other alternative: to invent the world. And to do this, his main tool is language. Most ofJ. L. Borges' fictions reflect, with more or less intensity, and are based on, the problematic yet essential relation between those fictions that constitute man's "official" version of reality and those others presented and accepted as consciously false. From the perspective of Borges' attitude toward language and to his own fiction-making, this study is a short meditation on the repercussions of knowledge as invention. 4. Business session. Election of officers. 5. "El motivo del olor en Artemio Cruz de Carlos Fuentes," Genaro J. Perez, University of Texas, Permian Basin. (20 min.) El uso de olores para desarrollar la caracterizaci6n del protagonista y establecer ambientes que contribuyen a la elaboraci6n de la obra constituye un motivo importante que ha sido ignorado hasta ahora en los copiosos estudios que se han hecho de La muerte de Artemio Cruz por Carlos Fuentes. En esta ponencia me propongo examinar todos aquellos olores que tienen como prop6sito revelar algo del caracter de Artemio Cruz y/o crear ambientes improtantes en la composicion de la novela. Tales olores pueden dividirse en dos grupos. Los positivos por regla general se observan en situaciones gratas, la mayoria de ellas retrospectivas - particularmente en esas partes narradas en la tercera persona del singular- y los negativos usualmente describen el deterioro moral y fisico de Artemio Cruz. 6. "Writing for Fewer and Fewer: Peruvian Fiction 1979-1980," David 0. Wise, Texas Woman's University. (20 min.) Despite the incorporation of well-known novelists such as Mario Vargas Llosa into the international post-boom circuit of literary commercialization, the Peruvian publishing industry itself remains cash-poor and parochial. Within Peru, nationally-published books are few and expensive, and the market for works of creative fiction is undergoing a process of shrinkage. Against this background, the paper reviews major trends in Peruvian fiction during 1977 and 1978, and discusses three novels published in 1979: Manuel Scorza's La tumba del reldmpago, Guillermo Thorndike's La batalla de Lima, and Fernando Ampuero's Miraflores' Melody. 7. "La noci6n existencial del absurdo en Cien ahos de soledad," Emilio Fabian Garcia, University of Southwestern Louisiana. (20 min.) "El primero de la estirpe esta amarrado a un arbol y al filtimo se lo estan comiendo las hormigas." Este es el epigrafe de los pergaminos de Melquiades, cuyas claves para decifrarlos se le revelan al ultimo Aureliano al final de Cien ahos de soledad. Ya que los pergaminos y el texto de la novela son uno y el mismo, debemos suponer que el epigrafe es en si la clave que descrifra el prop6sito primordial de Gracia Marquez en escribir su obra, y el cual es expresar lo absurdo de la condici6n humana, la angustia existencial del hombre. Special Interest Groups and Special Sessions THURSDAY AFTERNOON October 22, 1981 3:00-5:30 p.m. DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAMS IN READING AND WRITING - Colorado [Special Session] Chairman: Jeanette Harris, East Texas State University Secretary: David Williams, Abilene Christian University 1. "Reading and Writing: A Study of the Correlations," Paul Beran, Stephen F. Austin State University. (30 min.) Every composition teacher intuitively knows that particular relationships exist between a student's reading ability and his writing ability, but without specific data to support this intuition, one merely founders amidst generalizations and unsubstantiated hypotheses. This paper will present some specific correlations between reading and writing ability, thus allowing some general conclusions to be drawn about the interdependency of these two language skills. 2. "Sentence-Combining in the Developmental Program, "Dianna F. Campbell, St. Mary's University, and Michael Hennessy, Southwest Texas State University. (30 min.) Recent research suggests that practice in sentence- combining improves students' reading as well as their writing skills. This paper will review the research and suggest that sentence-combining can be an excellent instructional method on which to base a developmental course. Offering an alternative to the traditional workbook approach, sentence-combining not only helps students locate and eliminate errors but also promotes growth in syntactic fluency, which, in turn, aids in the development of effective reading skills. 3. "Writing to Be Read," Patricia Bates, LSU-Shreveport. (30 min.) The folklife/family heritage unit presented in this paper is designed to help developmental students improve their THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN 67 Fall, 1981</page><page sequence="21">68 ThE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN Fall, 1981 Thursday Afternoon Continued reading comprehension, to involve them in the process of writing, and to motivate them to become more successful writers. Beginning with reading selections from Foxfire and essays describing folkways and customs, the students develop questionnaires and conduct interviews to collect materials for a paper on some aspect of their family history or folklife.The paper goes through several drafts and revisions, during which time class discussions are devoted to principles of writing and reading, such as unity, coherence, sentence variety, and diction. 4. "Critical Reading Through Creative Writing," Robert Cosgrove, Texas Tech University, and Jerome Shea, University of New Mexico. (30 min.) Integration of reading and writing instruction in the developmental class increases the students' chances for successful skills development. An approach which achieves this type of integration involves teaching critical reading through creative writing. Students improve their ability to predict and anticipate content as they study opening passages of short stories and then write their own versions of what they think occurs in the story. They also develop increased author-awareness and audience-awareness as they alternately adopt the roles of writer and reader. 5. "Punctuation Instruction as an Aid to the Developmental Student's Overall Writing Ability," Ray Leighman, Texas A&amp;M University. (30 min.) The study of punctuation associated with coordinate elements in series, parenthetical elements, and introductory elements not only aids students in the mastery of mechanical writing skills but also improves the unity, coherence, conciseness, and readability of their writing. This paper presents statistical data to substantiate this correlation between the mastery of certain aspects of punctuation and a student's overall writing ability and will discuss effective strategies for teaching these punctuation skills. ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE - Parlor B Chairman: Andrea Bermudez, University of Houston-Clear Lake Secretary: Elaine Graybill, Southwestern University, Georgetown 1. "The Clustering Effect in Academic Discourse and Its Implications for Teaching Advanced ESL Reading," Linda Lonon Blanton, University of New Orleans. (18 min.) The key to perceiving the underlying conceptual structure of an academic text lies in recognizing the writer's system of subordinating and coordinating content, which, in turn, operates to form a series of rhetorical blocks or clusters. Through guided questioning, ESL students can be trained to recognize the clusters and analyze their relationships to each other. By recognizing the clusters and the hierarchy of information contained therein, students can abstract the conceptual structure underlying the text for a fuller understanding of the text. To illustrate the clustering phenomenon and the inherent hierarchical relationships within academic discourse, a sample text will be analyzed. Terms will be explained and student-directed questions will be posed. The sample text with questions and an accompanying exercise will constitute a sample adavnced-level ESL reading lesson. 2. "A Generative Sentence Model for the ESL Classroom," P. A. McCormack, Loyola University, and Julian Wasserman, University of St. Thomas. (20 min.) Because of the hurried nature of many ESL courses, the bulk of instruction frequently tends to be prescriptive rather than descriptive and therefore deals almost exclusively with surface structure. In contrast, this paper presents a useful generative model which not only allows students to construct sentences but also makes clear a number of points about perceptual biases of people who would use such a linguistic model by demonstrating the conscious emphasis which English places on such elements as time and space as well as the speaker's treatment of the subjects around which those sentences are constructed. 3. "Teaching Library/Research Skills to University Foreign Students," Victoria Price, Lamar University. (25 min.) The teaching of library/research skills frequently fails to take into consideration distinctive needs of the inexperienced foreign student whose high school experience abroad did not include even fundamental skills of using an American library system or American methods of writing a research paper. Unmerited assumptions about previous experience result in frustrations in a number of areas: specialized library-related vocabulary; unsuitable materials for library orientation; misleading and/or vague explanations in handbooks of composition designed to serve as guides in research paper writing. An explanation of several kinds of materials frequently used with foreign students is made, and suggestions for correcting or improving the materials are given. 4. Business session. Election of officers. (15 min.) 5. "Teaching Sensitivity to Cultural Transition: The Use of Selected Short Stories," Tom J. Lewis, Louisiana Tech University. (25 min.) A variety of methods has been developed for preparing people to meet the problems that arise in adjusting to life in another culture. This paper describes a method in which a specially selected group of short stories is used to illustrate and dramatize the various stages of cultural transition and the kind of experience that one can expect to undergo at each stage. Because most literary texts were not written with the overt intention of making a point about intercultural communication, the student can experience the intercultural dimension of the text with almost as little mediation as he might experience it in his own life. 6. "Games in the E.S.L. Classroom," Phyllis B. Nimmons, Houston Baptist University. (18 min.) Research has consistently shown that students like games. As teachers learn more about how people learn languages, they also understand more clearly the role of games in the classroom. In the cognitive approach to second-language learning, appropriate games do provide the activities necessary to language acquisition. The paper presents a summary of Piaget's four stages of development and suggests suitable games to facilitate the cognitive development of students. General criteria for games, their selection, and their structuring are presented. It is concluded that it is possible and advisable to design academic games which encourage meaningful communication. 7. "Lecture-Listening and Note-Taking Skills in English for Academic Purposes," Mary R. Hank, University of New Orleans. (18 min.) Both faculty and international students rank lecture-listening and note-taking skills as extremely important for success for international students of American universities. Yet research by Huckin and Olsen shows that foreign engineering students have trouble following academic lectures. Therefore, academically oriented ESL students must be trained in effective lecture-listening and note-taking skills. Materials used 68 THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN Fall, 1981</page><page sequence="22">FaIl, 1981 THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN 69 should stress organization of the lecture, main ideas and support, coherence signals, perception of attitudes, abbreviating and paraphrasing. A number of exercises will be presented to demonstrate the teaching of these skills and to serve as models for further materials development. INTERNATIONAL COURTLY LITERATURE SOCIETY - Parlor C [Special Session] Chairman: Deborah Nelson, Rice University Secretary: Susan Clark, Rice University 1. "The Wayward Nun in Late Medieval Literature," Graciela Daichman, Rice University. (20 min.) The figure of the wayward nun appears in ballads and bawdy tales, in lyrics and roundelays, in sermons, chansons, and fabliaux. She is, however, much more than a literary presence created by the medieval mind. She belongs to the real world of the nunnery; sinner and sufferer, pardoned or condemned, the unchaste nun is still waiting to be understood. The evidence of the existence of real-life apostate nuns is too abundant to be ignored: episcopal visitations, papal injunctions, conventual cartularies and church documents, all record cases of immodest or immoral behavior in the nunnery. The responsibility for the existence of such a phenomenon lies not only with the structure of the Catholic Church but also with the nature of medieval society. 2. "Characters of the Conflict of Love and Society in Gottfried's Tristan," Rolph Hornung, Rice University. (20 min.) The representatives of society are Curvenal, Rual, Isolde Regina, and Mark. Each encounters the protagonists from a limited, prejudicial point of view that is a function of his or her social identity. In contrast, Brangaene stands in an uncannily sympathetic relation to the protagonists that is not determined by any social role. She is the lover's servant, at the Irish court and in Mark's bed, and also their teacher, in the episodes of the lovers' ruses. Brangaene performs vital service for the lovers by helping to conceal their love and also by enhancing it through her verbal instruction and the positive example of her actions. 3. "Expectation and Admonition in Hartmann's Der arme Heinrich," S. L. Clark, Rice University. (20 min.) In the overtly didactic Der arme Heinrich, Hartmann manipulates his courtly audience's assumptions to the degree that the reversal of these expectations becomes a central artistic principle. In charting Heinrich's movement from richness to poverty to blessedness, Hartmann consistently sets up plot junctures that demand action, raises audience expectations that a certain action will follow, and then undercuts these expectations with either a lack of action or a substitute action. The surprising fall and equally astonishing restoration of leprous Heinrich thus serves as an admonition to a courtly audience aspiring to knightly virtues such as Heinrich possesses: "geburt, richeit, guot, ere, muot." 4. "Love Sickness in the Dolce Stil Nuovo," Daniel L. Heiple, Tulane University. (20 min.) An understanding of medieval medical treatises is essential to an appreciation of two poems in the Dolce Stil Nuovo: Cavalcanti's "Donna me prega" and Cino da Pistoia's "Io non posso celar lo mio dolore." An analysis of the language demonstrates the importance of an explanation of love based on physiology as an alternative to the theological-philosophical conception which condemned human love as a sin. 5. "Images et allegories dans les Cent Ballades et Rondeaux de Christine de Pisan," Dominique Schock, Rice University. (20 min.) Les Cent Ballades et Rondeaux de Christine de Pisan sont riches en images et allegories qui, associ6s a l'id6e de souffrance, contribuent au lyrisme et a l'originalite de ces petits receuils. Parmi les images exprimant le tourment, j'ai pu relever celles de l'hiver, la chambre, "l'huis," et la fenetre, la lune, le vent. Les allegories, comme celle de la nef, du d6sert, de la brebis, de la Fortune sont particuli0rement developp6es et riches de sens. Certaines images et allegories empruntent au vocabulaire de la joie, mais celui-ci est alors employe dans un contexte n6gatif: la disparition du soleil, le bonheur perdu. LANGUAGE, LINGUISTICS, AND LITERATURE - Rio Grande [Special Session] Chairman: Bates Hoffer, Trinity University Secretary: Martin Todaro, University of Texas at Austin 1. "Current Trends in the Field: a Bibliographic Perspective," James R. Bennett, University of Arkansas. (20 min.) A survey of last year's publications in the area of language, linguistics, and literature indicates that as many as six trends have developed. The established ones, such as close textual investigation, are represented of course. Growing areas include the studies of reader response to the literary work. This paper is designed as a "state of the art" presentation which will lead into the next two papers. 2. "Meaning at the Several Levels in Poetry," A. A. Hill, University of Texas at Austin. (20 min.) The subject of meaning in poetry may be handled in linguistic terms. On the text level, the language of the literary work, meaning is single unless there is evidence for multiple meanings. On the meta-level, the non-textual level, meaning can be and often is multiple. Conflicts with this approach arise with non-linguistic critics who view this linguistics approach as "reductionist." Two poems will be analyzed as examples of this linguistic approach to the treatment of meaning in poetry. 3. "Syntactic and Performative Analysis of Poetry: Sylvia Plath's 'Daddy,"' Carolyn Gray, University of Texas at Austin. (20 min.) The growing interest in the communicative aspects of literature can be exemplified by the merging of the interests of linguistic approaches to literature. The two approaches seem to be closely allied in the full study of literature. This presentation will begin with a syntactic analysis of Sylvia Plath's "Daddy" and then move on to a performance of the poem itself. SOUTH CENTRAL AMERICAN NAME SOCIETY- Parlor D Chairman: Karl Ames, University of Texas at Austin Secretary: Ralph D. Howell, Mississippi College 1. "Special Types of Religious Names Used by Mexican Americans," Richard D. Woods, Trinity University. (17 min.) All Mexican Americans bear some type of religious first name. Certain ones stand out because they have distinguishing characteristics. As unique names they may be divided into four groups according to their denotations: biblical, shrine, devotion to the Virgin, and other concepts peculiar to Roman Catholicism. The purpose of this presentation is to study these special names and determine their importance within the total naming system. Considered also is the assumption that Hispanic groups show an intimacy with the deity by frequent use of religious names.

Lockney, University of North Dakota. (17 min.) Courts have increasingly been forced to deal with the issue of a woman's right to choose her name. Most cases seek parity for women under the fourteenth amendment's guarantee of equal protection. More recently, several courts have raised issues of parental freedom from state regulation. Conflicts between a mother and father are generating new issues. It is time to focus directly on the constitutional sources for an individual's freedom to pick a name - the first amendment and the right to privacy recognized by the Supreme Court. 3. "When Authors Name their Characters," Ernestine P. Sewell, The University of Texas at Arlington. (17 min.) From letters, lectures, and interviews, authorial practices for choosing names are presented as an introduction. Included are Benjamin Capps, William Owens, Oliver La Farge, and Aldous Huxley. The paper then summarizes the purposes naming serves: satirizing; creating connotations for characterization; gaining authenticity of race, place, and time; disguising real models. An analysis of the use of names for structuring a novel focuses on Malamud's Dubin's Lives and Welch's The Death of Jim Loney. When naming is the strategy for structure, reader-oriented criticism is more likely to stand the test of validity, for clues to meaning are "foregrounded." 4. "The Past Revisited: Some Eponyms Present in Modern English," Donald A. Gill, University of Southwestern Louisiana. (15 min.) Eponymy (from the Greek epi "upon" plus onoma "name") is the derivation of a word from the name of a person or a place to represent a distinct idea associated with the name which served as its source. In everyday usage, many people are unaware that they are using words which are eponyms, but the English language contains in excess of forty thousand eponyms. Even the slang term hooker derives from the name of a Civil War general who permitted prostitutes to travel with his troops. This paper discusses some eponyms which are commonly used by educated people. 5. "Names in Joyce Cary's The Horse's Mouth," R. Balfour Daniels, University of Houston, Emeritus. (15 min.) With a few exceptions the names in Joyce Cary's The Horse's Mouth are ordinary and commonplace. The title of the book is a phrase of unmistakable meaning but of debatable origin. The name of the narrator, the artist Gulley Jimson, is unusual and appropriate. His first name sounds like a nickname but is not and in fact is the name of a noted nineteenth-century sportsman. Why his last name is an appropriate patronymic is explained, while another patronymic, Hickson, is commented on. Some of the nicknames are common enough, but others created by Jimson are highly amusing. 6. Business session. Election of officers. 7. "The Significance of Names in Henry James' Daisy Miller," Patricia E. Dean, Clarke College. (15 min.) For years psychologists have been saying that a person's name can have a profound effect on his personality. In The Name Game, Christopher P. Anderson argues that a person's name can affect his psychological make-up by the way a person feels about his name, and by the way other people react to the name. A writer as meticulous as Henry James could hardly ignore the effect of his characters' names on their personalities. A good example of characterization through naming can be found in his novelette, Daisy Miller. 8. "Nicknames of Boxers," Lawrence F. Mc Namee, East Texas State University. (17 min.) It is a rare sports fan who knows the real names behind the nicknames of professional boxers. There are five common reasons why boxers change their names or pick up additional monikers. First is an identification with a community or area: The Boston Gob. The second touches on a profession once followed: Fireman Jim Flynn. Third are physical characteristics, especially suggesting a name if alliteration is possible. Two-ton Tony. Fourth are terms from the animal kingdom such as hawk, gorilla. Finally, there are names that suggest violence and terror: The Michigan Assassin. TECHNICAL WRITING - Nueces Chairman: Douglas M. Catron, Iowa State University Secretary: Dennis E. Minor, Louisiana Tech Universary 1. "What They Really Do: A Survey of On-The-Job Communication Activities of Executives, Administrators, and Managers," Lillian O. Feinberg, Past President, ABCA; Iowa State University. (20 min.) What do executives, administrators, and managers really do? How important do they consider communication? What should students be taught to prepare them for high level positions? To answer these questions for a text in business communication, I asked more than one hundred men and women in various occupations in the United States and Canada to contribute logs of a "typical" day. Colleagues in ABCA and personal friends provided names of outstanding people, from artists and architects to engineers and social scientists. Both personal interviews with selected candidates and their logs revealed a need for a "holistic approach" in business communication. 2. "Graduate Programs and Undergraduate Concentrations in Technical Writing," Thomas L. Warren, Oklahoma State University. (18 min.) Oklahoma State Universary offers a degree in English. A student, however, may select a "traditional" program, a teacher certification option, or an option in technical writing. The technical writing option includes five courses in technical writing plus two in linguistics. The student has one elective course in technical writing. The presentation includes a history of the program at Oklahoma State and suggestions for establishing a similar program. 3. "Ethos in Technical Discourse," Dorothy Margaret Guinn, Arizona State University. (18 min.) Even though technical writers, more than any other kind, seek to obliterate personality, it nonetheless permeates technical discourse. The writer emerges in choice of words; material, whether describing, defining, or merely naming something; level of explanation; questioning or non-questioning attitude toward authority; sense of certainty or doubt. Each aspect of style and nuance of meaning adds shading and substance to the author's developing ethos. A careful study of strategies in technical writing will help determine which practices are most damaging to gaining audience agreement, which most effective. 4. "Business session. Electionof officers. 5. "The Creative Exchange Between the Technical Writer and Editor," Daniel Marder, University of Tulsa. (20 min.) A study of the exchange between technical writer and editor offers an opportunity better to understand the composing process because it is shared and because it 70 THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN Fall, 1981</page><page sequence="24">FaIl, 1981 THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN 71 always involves an internal play on an external world. The editor must to some extent assume the writer's composing process, whether consciously or unconsciously, in his or her re-composing process, and thus is in a good position to consciously record it. Knowledge of the recomposing process may lead to better results in the editing of technical discourse and a better understanding of the composing process. 6. 'In Defense of the Liberal Arts Approach," Elizabeth Harris, University of Texas, Austin. (18 min.) The liberal arts approach to studying what is called pragmatically "technical writing" is attacked from two sides. One is that of technical writing specialists who reject the notion that the liberal arts have anything to bring to their field. The other is that of liberal arts scholars who reject the notion that there is anything in technical writing worth studying from their traditional perspectives. This paper attempts to demonstrate what one kind of liberal arts approach can bring to the study of technical writing and what such an approach finds there that should concern liberal arts scholars. 7. "Career Minors in Technical Writing," Malcolm Richardson, Texas A&amp;M University. (18 min.) Despite frequent accusations that university programs designed to train technical writers cause lower enrollments in literature and humanities courses, a technical writing curriculum can actually bolster these enrollments. Students need only be shown that writing careers are both lucrative and intellectually satisfying. Students in Texas A&amp;M's Writing Specialization are eased into writing careers through internships and co-op programs which match the student's writing interests. Because of these options, not only are more students changing to English majors, but other departments are establishing writing "career minors" which encourage the humanities. THURSDAY EVENING October 22, 1981 7-10 p.m. SPECIAL ADDRESS: Robert M. Lumiansky, ACLS, 'The Humanities and the National Interest," UT-Austin campus, Academic Center, Room #21 (transportation details to be provided at convention), followed by a reception with UT-Austin as host, Academic Center, Knopf Room (4th floor) FRIDAY AFTERNOON 4:00-6:00 p.m. Open Hearing, MLA Special Report on the State of the Profession - Brazos (tentative) The panelists include Jean A. Perkins, French, Swarthmore; Raymund A. Paredes, English, UCLA; and John I. Fischer, English, LSU (Perkins and Paredes are members of the Commission on the Future of the Profession). The respondents are Catharine S. Brosman, French, Tulane; James A. Castaieda, Spanish, Rice; and Winfred P. Lehmann, Linguistics &amp; German, UT-Austin. FRIDAY EVENING October 23, 1981 6:00-8:00 p.m. LITERARY THEORY - Nueces Chairman: C. Harry Bruder, University of Southern Louisiana Secretary: Bruce Henricksen, Loyola University of the South 1. "Filling the Gap: Story-Telling as Interpretation," Ronald Schleifer, University of Oklahoma. (20 min.) This paper explores how authors and interpreters fill gaps in literary works with more or less complete narratives; how story-telling functions both as intel pletation and, simultaneously, as a means to allay the anxiety of having nothing to say. This impulse will be followed in Wordsworth, Yeats, James, George Moore, and Joyce; the paper also explores how interpreters of these writers - Geoffrey Hartman, Harold Bloom, Hugh Kenner, etc. - constantly repeat the narrative process of the texts they examine. 2. "The Function of Prejudice in Teleological Hermeneutics," Joel Weinsheimer, Texas Tech University. (20 min.) Paul Ricoeur defines teleological, as opposed to archeological, hermeneutics as that process in which the "symbol gives rise to thought." The same definition, this paper suggests, might well serve for prejudice. In abandoning the ideal ofpresuppositionless thought typical of Cartesian rationalism and Husserlian phenomenology, Heidegger and Gadamer, like Ricoeur, rescue prejudice from its enlightenment connotations and demonstrate the modes of its operation in literary criticism as in other spheres of understanding: as the condition of writing literature, of understanding literature, and of writing criticism. Teleological literary criticism, ideally, is that which is itself literary because it is prejudiced by the work itself. 3. Business session. Election of officers. 4. "Connotation and Figuration," J. Dudley Andrew, University of Iowa. (40 min.) (By special invitation.) No abstract available.

"Papadieu, una novela corta de Hilda Perera," Alicia Aldaya, University of New Orleans. Del enfrentamiento de dos mundos contrastantes: el mundo horrible de Vietnam y el mundo prometedor de la Florida surge un relato tejido de esperanzas a trav6s del cual, y a pesar de la brevedad de la obra, la autora ha logrado entregarnos unos personajes que nos estremecen con su calida humanidad. 2. "Mass-Fiction Conventions and Feminist Critique of Discourse in the Short Fiction of Silvina Bullrich," Naomi Lindstrom, The University of Texas at Austin. This study looks at an especially troubling matter of critical evaluation: the short stories of Silvina Bullrich. While one cannot rate Bullrich's stories highly for satisfying artistic complexity, her ideas concerning women's discourse difficulties stand out clearly. In this one textual case, at least, a very "massified" pop-fiction form has become the bearer of sex-role examination. 3. "La injusticia social en 'Un caso' de Ester Matte," Ana Maria L6pez, Mississippi State University. El nombre de Ester Matte merece ser destacado entre las primeras escritoras hispanoamericanas que cultivan el g6nero narrativo corto. La injusticia, anclada en un ambiente urbano, es el tema que domina en "Un caso," una narraci6n en donde la autora da la impresi6n de querer convertir este "cuadro de costumbres" an poderosa arma de combate. 4. "Tecnicismo y metafisica en 'Con la vida puesta' de Victoria Urbano," Maria Paez de Ruiz, Southwest Texas State University. Se analiza c6mo el relato "Con la vida puesta," el cual forma parte de la colecci6n titulada Y era otra vez, esta estructurado conforme a un sistema de simetrias y contrastes que contribuye el desarrollo de una angustia metafisica. BIBLIOGRAPHY- Parlor C Chairman: Donald W. Rude, Texas Tech University Secretary: Peter Shillingsburg, Mississippi State University 1. "Research Possibilities at the Humanities Research Center," Ellen S. Dunlap, Research Librarian, HRC, University of Texas at Austin (Guest speaker). (20 min.) [No abstract available.] 2. "Problems in Editing the Error-Prone: John Donne and Joseph Conrad," Ernest W. Sullivan, II, Texas Tech University. (15 min.) In his manual for printers, Mechanick Exercises, Joseph Moxon recommends that compositors correct authorial errors of spelling, punctuation, capitalization, etc., on the assumption that authors do not write very well. Modern bibliographical theorists condemn his solution to authorial ineptitude; however, Moxon's assessment seems, on the basis of recent experience with John Donne and Joseph Conrad, essentially correct. Many of Donne's marginal citations in Biathanatos are wrong and his misquotations frequent; Conrad, in Lord Jim, commits truly stunning grammatical gaffs. To edit, or not to edit, that is the question. 3. "Towards a Mature Style: The Manuscript of Waugh's Remote People," Robert Murray Davis, University of Oklahoma. (15 min.) Evelyn Waugh's second travel book, Remote People, was his first work as a Catholic writer and as a consciously mature writer. The manuscript is important because it is one of two available to scholars, because it demonstrates the arts of revision by which Waugh highlighted scenes, events, and characters by deletion, augmentation, and thorough recasting of material. In it Waugh first achieved a consistently formal and serious style and created a persona far different from the narrators of his first two novels. 4. "Lawrence's Revisions of Women in Love," Diane S. Bonds, Southwest Texas State University. (15 min.) The two successive typescripts of Women in Love housed at the Humanities Research Center of the University of Texas at Austin show that one of Lawrence's primary aims in revising the novel was to elaborate and refine the idea that modern civilization is suffering a process of disintegration, a collapse of received values and traditional modes of perception and being. This aim is reflected in revisions that emphasize the split between conscious and unconscious processes in the characters and in Lawrence's progressive reliance on non-human metaphors which suggest the dehumanization of some characters. 5. "Joseph Conrad, Film Writer," Neill R. Joy, Colgate University. (20 min.) In 1920, urged on by the profit motive, Conrad turned his story "Gaspar Ruiz" into a scenario for a film. A typescript of the scenario with Conrad's cursive revisions is preserved at Colgate University. A study of the typescript allows the scholar to see how Conrad, whose manner of narration, symbolic description, and imagery provides a fine match with the mechanical techniques of the camera, managed the conversion of the story to another form. 6. Business session. Election of officers. CHILDREN'S LITERATURE- Rio Grande Chairman: D. Thomas Hanks, Jr., Baylor University Secretary: Patricia Russell, Stephen F. Austin State University 1. "Myra Cohn Livingston's Humanizing the Universe: Images of Nature," Debbie Hull, Stephen F. Austin State University. (22 min.) Myra Cohn Livingston uses her poems as a means of presenting various aspects of life to children. Whether relating spring to childhood, ants to commuters, birds to quarreling children, November trees to aged humans, or dead grasshoppers to dead humans, Livingston personifies and personalizes nature to communicate basic truths to her readers. It is clear that to Livingston, "Delight is of prime importance," but it is also clear that "wisdom (will) follow" a perceptive reading of her poems. 2. "The Poet as Ringmaster: An Explication of Jack Prelutsky's Circus," Douglas Street, Texas A&amp;M University. (25 min.) The circus motif is not new to the creative artist, yet few have captured its spectacle as has Jack Prelutsky in his seventeen-poem, three-ring extravaganza, Circus. Through strategic positioning of pieces and their components, the audience is manipulated completely by this ringmaster of words from page to page, emotion to emotion. The superstructure erected, Prelutsky orchestrates wording, consonantal/assonantal variation, and thematic possibilities around and through his established anapestic mode. This paper examines both the overt and the covert intricacies that go to construct in the reader's mind's eye a circus performance nonpareil given by a poet turned ringmaster. 3. "Into a Handsome Prince: The Implications of Physical Transformations in Certain Fairy Tales," Cynthia J. Smith, University of Texas at Austin. (25 min.) The essence of a child's growth is change - change in physical size, in appearance, in emotions, and in perception. Transformations of these and other kinds are significant parts of a child's life; thus it is no surprise to find 72 THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN Fall, 1981</page><page sequence="26">FaIl, 1981 THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN 73 that transformation is a highly significant motif in certain fairy tales of the "Beauty and the Beast" or "frog into prince" sub-genre. An analysis of selected tales suggests the transformation of ugly beast into desirable male externalizes the maturation of a dependent girl into independent womanhood. 4. Business session. Election of officers. CHRISTIANITY AND LITERATURE - Brazos-Trinity [Special Session] Chairman: George W. Van Devender, Hardin-Simmons University Secretary: W. R. Wortman, Baylor University 1. "Robert Frost's Poetic Concern with Death and the Hereafter," Robert A. Fink, Hardin-Simmons University. (15 min.) Several of Robert Frost's poems ask questions relating to death and immortality. Frost indicates that even though man accepts life as temporary, he would prefer not to die. He cannot be sure what is waiting for him, and it might be John Calvin's God. The poems offer two possible stances for coping with this unknown - "stoicism" (i.e., wait and see) and "faith." Faith is stressed as being essential when night descends and "nobody comes with a light," because empirical knowledge cannot always provide answers, and man is desperately in need of reassurance. 2. "Toward a Poetry of Accommodation: The Invocation to Book III of Paradise Lost," Dale G. Priest, Abilene Christian University. (15 min.) Paradise Lost is "divine" and thus requires an act of accommodation if it is to be accessible and useful to a fallen audience. Thematically, this need is met by the Son and his role as incarnate, legible "Word." Analogous to this is the dramatic role of the poet/narrator, who must render plain those things otherwise "invisible to mortal sight." It is this latter challenge which the poet recognizes and accepts in the invocation to Book III. 3. "G. Wilson Knight and Spiritualism," John E. Van Domelen, Texas A&amp;M University. (15 min.) G. Wilson Knight, the noted English interpreter of Shakespeare, has been concerned with the Christian dimensions of literature since the appearance of his first published essays in the late 1920's. But he did not become involved with spiritualism until 1950, shortly after the death of his mother. Though Spiritualism at first appealed to Knight because of his desire to believe that death is not a final separation, his continued interest derives from his belief that the dominant positivistic thought of modernity has slighted the supernatural. 4. "Charlatans in the Hands of a Satiric Poet: Thomas Shadwell on Religious Practice in Post-Cromwellian Times," Mary McBride, Texas Tech University. (15 min.) Some of the most preposterous characters in the body of Shadwellian drama are religious pretenders and extremists, some of whose profundity suggests the abuse and, later, widely projected theory of natural law as the ruling power of the universe. Without emphasizing religion or morality as the main burden of his dramatic purpose, Shadwell reflects the religious milieu of his Restoration contemporaries, from whom he drew patterns for the religious attitudes displayed by men and women of his drama. 5. Business session. Election of officers. 6. "Goodman Brown, Hulga Hopewell, and the 'Unwilling Instrument of Grace,'" Delores Washburn, Hardin-Simmons University. (15 min.) Flannery O'Connor's frequent use of the devil as "the unwilling instrument of grace" has two purposes: to convince a modern audience that the devil exists and that redemption is necessary. Her use of the devil and the disparagement of rationalism link O'Connor with Hawthorne, who believed that the heart of man is less developed than the head. In "Good Country People" the devil is similar to Hawthorne's devil in "Young Goodman Brown"; however, though many similarities exist between the two tales, inversions with regard to the protagonists lead to a comic resolution rather than a tragic one in O'Connor's. story. 7. "The Waverley World and Catholicism," George W. Boswell, University of Mississippi. (15 min.) A lifelong Anglican, Sir Walter Scott has been accused of alternately attacking and searching for values in other denominations, including Roman Catholicism. He was fascinated by its traditionalism, color, stability, and ritual but repelled by his understanding of its worldliness, persecution, and opportunism, its suppression of the Biblical text, the triviality of some of its doctrines, and the idleness, arrogance, and Jesuitism of its priests. Scott employed ecclesiasticism mostly for human motivation in history and for descriptive decoration and concentrated his everyday thought on the virtues common to all Christian faiths. 8. "Milton, Liberty, and the Pauline Renaissance," Darryl Tippens, Oklahoma Christian University. (15 min.) Historians of the Reformation and of English Puritanism have long recognized the profound influence of Pauline thought on Milton's age, generally overlooked by Miltonists. Milton's claim that he followed "the pattern of St. Paul's reasoning" is borne out in the major themes of his life and art - especially in his view of liberty. In the main, Milton is surprisingly faithful to the spirit of early Paulinism. With time his view of liberty changed significantly - and radically - to a more Pauline formulation. He became a Pauline antinomian, free "from the rule of the law and of man," and bounded only by charity. 9. "Two Views of Revolution: Porter's Laura and Welty's Phoenix Jackson," James Walter, Southeastern Louisiana University. (15 min.) Porter's "Flowering Judas" can serve as a helpful foil to increase the reader's understanding of Welty's "A Worn Path," since both stories focus on the ways human desire and natural temporality diverge and merge. Phoenix Jackson seems at first stereotypical, but Welty has created her to undermine interpretive assumptions of her rationalistic readers. Almost led into misinterpreting the ambiguous signs surrounding Phoenix and her quest, readers are surprised into discovering her paradigmatic action and virtue. In contrast to Laura, Phoenix has a largeness of vision that results from her careful acceptance of her time and place as mediators of Divine intention. FILM AS LITERATURE - San Antonio Chairman: David L. Fagan, University of Houston Downtown College Secretary: John Mossier, Loyola University 1. "Shakespeare's The Tempest in a Second Age of Science: Forbidden Planet," Merrilee A. Cunningham, University of Houston-Downtown College. (20 min.) Forbidden Planet, like Shakespeare's The Tempest from which it largely derives, questions the nature of man, the possibilities of a Utopia, and the dangers of the new science. Through the Prospero-like character of Morbius, the Ferdinand-like character of the captain and the Miranda-like character of Altaira, as well as other similar characters, Cyril Hume's script tests man's ability to control his technology and the opposing elements of his own psyche. Hume, like Shakespeare, has a sad answer for us, THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN 73 Fall, 1981</page><page sequence="27">74 THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN FaIl, 1981 Friday Evening Continued though derived from post-Freudian psychology rather than Renaissance thought. 2. "Hemingway's 'My Old Man': An Approach to the Story and the Film," David Middleton, Trinity University. (20 min.) "My Old Man," adapted from Ernest Hemingway's short fiction and directed by Larry Lust, offers an apt selection for students studying fiction. The film, like many visual forms, reaches students at an affective level which stimulates class conversation. It also lends itself quite readily to systematic analysis within the frames of narrative romance and metaphor (as exposition, turning point and resolution). Through it, as through many other films, students learn much about what literature has to teach. 3. "'Anno Domini June Second 1910': Excerpts from a Closet Filmscript for Quentin Compson," Frances N. Neidhardt, East Texas State University. (20 min.) An original filmscript of the Quentin monologue from William Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury is framed by commentary on Jerry Walk's 1959 film violation [sic] of the stream of consciousness novel and by evidence that the expressive scenario or screenplay as written by novelists with visual sensitivites is emerging as a valid literary genre. From the excerpt, script sequences of the Quentin/Dalton Ames shoot-out at the bridge, the Quentin/Gerald Bland knock-out at the picnic, and the final moments of Quentin's life are introduced in relation to their dominant formulating film influences, both visual and literary: Eisenstein's montage techniques and conceptions and Robbe-Grillet's scripting style for Last Year at Marienbad. 4. Business session. Election of officers. 5. "The Film Career of Robert Rossen: The Author as Screenwriter, Director, and Producer," Joseph R. Millichap, The University of Tulsa. (20 min.) Robert Rossen brought the artistic intensity and liberal realism of American theater during the Depression decade to Hollywood in 1934; over the next thirty years his screen career paralleled the general developments of American film. Rossen evolved from a committed Leftism, to a cynical reassessment of Post-War America, to a more complex and ambiguous personal viewpoint. Yet, as he developed, Rossen preserved and deepened the integrity of his original artistic vision. His evolution from screenwriter to director to producer seems motivated by his commitment to the fullest realization of the themes which characterize both his early stage and screenwriting. 6."Culture, Anarchy, and the Western Situation," Joanna E. Rapf, University of Oklahoma. (20 min.) The basic struggle between order and disorder, meaning and meaninglessness in the western is shaped around a symbolic framework juxtaposing the rituals of birth, marriage, and death against a pursuit pattern associated with revenge. This is elucidated through methodology from Morse Peckham's work with the "romantic situation." Whereas the "romantic situation" embodies a rebellion against the formality of a classical world view of civilization and rationality as man's triumphs, the "western situation" does the reverse, taking the side of civilization, asking for light and reason and compromise to cope with the darkness and chaos that are always waiting to submerge man. 7."Johnny Guitar: A Woman's Film," Joyce Armstrong Carroll, McMurry College (20 min.) Johnny Guitar stands as a woman's film anachronistically wedged into a Hollywood era of female vacuousness and because of that fact has remained neglected. Yet it is an engaging film, fitting squarely into an established genre, the western, and comments upon the society of its day through means which engender continued appeal. This may be observed through examining Johnny Guitar on three levels: (1) the literal level as an engrossing western; (2) the social level as a comment on the witch-hunting of the fifties; (3) the universal levels as an application of the film's own illusion aesthetic, appearance versus reality. MODERN DRAMA - Parlor D Chairman: Harris Ross, Spring Hill College Secretary: Christine Pickering Ford, Northwestern State University of Louisiana 1. "Tracing the Absurd: Stripping Away the Masks," John Zurlo, Lamar University. (20 min.) There has been a consistent and logical development toward the Theater of the Absurd throughout this century. Analyses of works by four important European playwrights demonstrate this movement. Strindberg's The Ghost Sonata, Pirandello's Henry IV, Camus' Caligula, and Ionesco's The Chairs share a philosophical foundation of existentialism; and a life with no meaning becomes one continual theatre in which people don masks and assume roles. These dramatists show humanity's complex nature, approachable only by probing into the psyche. They all illustrate how logical, photographic representations of life fail to portray its real nature. 2. "The Rehearsal and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead: A Comparison," Kathleen Duke, Alabama Christian College. (10 min.) Both The Rehearsal, attributed to George Villars, Duke of Buckingham, and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, written by Tom Stoppard, are plays about plays. A comparison of this eighteenth-century satire with this twentieth-century existential comedy in terms of their use of other plays as reference points, of the play-within-a-play technique, and of such literary devices as characterization and figurative language reveals some fundamental differences. Further, such a comparison illuminates the attitudes toward dramatic literature, human nature, and the human condition which separate the world view of the Age of Reason from the world view of the Age of the Absurd. 3. "A Play Within a Play: Clifford Odets' Waiting for Lefty," R. C. Reynolds, Lamar University. (15 min.) During the American thirties the popularity of workers' theaters grew as the economic conditions of the nation worsened. Troupes of players would stage short, allegorical skits, usually centering on the death of a striker's child, the cruelty of unyielding bosses, or the deplorable working conditions in a city's sweat shops. These plays would be performed during lunch breaks or before and after a shift change at a factory or industrial plant. The purpose of such theatrical events was to stimulate the oppressed workers and move them into action, and the name given these plays was "agit prop," for their clear intent was to agitate and propagandize the philosophy of the left. In 1936, however, Clifford Odets, a virtually unknown actor from the Group Theatre, borrowed this technique and wove it into the fabric of what many feel was the most important social drama of the decade, Waiting for Lefty. By combining the philosophy of "agit prop" theatre with the technique of the play within a play, Odets succesfully brought socially committed theater to Broadway, and he made the "call to 74 THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN Fall, 1981</page><page sequence="28">FaIl, 1981 THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN 75 social action" a standard element of the theater of his time. 4. Business session. Election of officers. 5. "Thornton Wilder and the Play without a Play," David Sauer, Spring Hill College. (15 min.) In many modern dramas involving the play-within-a-play technique, the audience is kept detached and separated from the fiction. Thornton Wilder's approach to drama is exactly the opposite. In his plays, the drama itself is seen as reality: it is an overview of all human experience. The real lives that the audience lives are, therefore, seen simply as small episodes in a larger play. The technique is rather like that of the medieval Corpus Christi plays, which gave an overview of human activity from Creation to the Last Judgment. In such a play, the audience could only see its life in the context of the grand overview given by the drama. Wilder's first collection, The Angel That Troubled the Waters (1928), reflects his debt to the medieval plays. The two different ways in which Wilder organizes this overview are the focus of this study. In essence, the plays can be divided into those which give an overview of space (Pullman Car Hiawatha) and of time (The Skin of Our Teeth). A synthesis of the two techniques is to be found in Our Town. 6. "Last Week I Was Ninety-Five: A Pitch for Regional Drama," J. E. Riehl, University of Southwestern Louisiana. (15 min.) Though it owes an obvious debt to Pirandello, Paul T. Nolan's Last Week I Was Ninety-Five is essentially a defense of regional drama. It recounts the struggles of an experimental community theater whose avowed purpose is to create drama drawn from life through the enactment of improvised scenes from the lives of the audience. At the play's conclusion, Burlington, director of The Life Theater, comes to realize that the theater does not have to show reality or to be useful; it can also do other things, not the least of which is to bring a group of lonely, sensitive people together for a play. RUSSIAN LANGUAGE AND METHODOLOGY - Parlor B Chairman: Jo Ann Bailey, University of Texas at El Paso Secretary: Rochelle H. Ross, Loyola University 1. "Shouldn't We Reassess Our Objectives in Our Russian Programs?" Joe Malik, Jr., University of Arizona. (20 min.) Emphasis on the study of languages has become more pragmatic as the nation has become a world power. The trend has been to turn to an active knowledge of languages stressing speaking fluency. But students claim that the two-year language requirement leaves them with a limited knowledge which serves no purpose. They are aware that they cannot acquire a speaking fluency in a language in so short a time. It behooves teachers to examine their objectives and adjust their programs to be more pragmatic in order to attract and serve the interests of a broader range of students. 2. "On Teaching Intonation in the Elementary Russian Course," Laurence R. Richter, Indiana University. (20 min.) The presentation is intended to demonstrate the efficacy and desirability of combining a solid grounding in phonetics and intonation with traditional grammar lessons even at elementary stages of language instruction. E. S. Bryzgunova's system of intonational constructions is used, with some elaborations added by the author. 3. "The Russian Classroom in the Community," Sarah P. Burke and Margaret Stovall, Trinity University. (20 min.) This paper describes the experiences of a third-year Russian class whose assignments included various kinds of interactions with Russian emigres in San Antonio, Texas. The authors consider both theoretical and practical bases of their experience. Audience participation is encouraged following the presentation. 4. Business session. Election of officers. FRIDAY EVENING 8:00-9:30 p.m. LITERATURE AND PSYCHOLOGY - Nueces ISpecial Session] Chairman: Lynne Lampe Carlisle, Texas A&amp;M University Secretary: Landrum Banks, Xavier University 1. "The Wise Old Man Archetype and the Quest for Self: Jungian Psychology in Bellow's Seize the Day," Deborah J. Barrett, Rice University. (15 min.) In Seize the Day, Saul Bellow presents Tommy Wilhelm, a desperate man in search of selfhood and provides him Tamkin, an archetypal Wise Old Man to guide him through his process of individuation. Tamkin delivers to Wilky the same advice that Jung expresses in his Underground Self and Modern Man in Search of a Soul; man has to move beyond his personas to find his "real" self, has to remove self-imposed and external burdens which hinder him, must learn to live in the present, and must work to discover his autonomy and self worth. With Tamkin's guidance, Wilky succeeds in reaching "the consummation of his heart's ultimate need." 2. "The Self Divided: A Horneian Analysis of Doris Lessing's May Quest," Rose Marie Cutting, St. Mary's University. (15 min.) According to psychoanalyst Karen Homey, the hallmark of neurosis is an irreconcilable split between the ideal self and the actual self. The demands of the ideal exclude the satisfaction of essential needs. Lessing's May Quest is a classic example of a woman's life spoiled by a form of neurosis women are conditioned to in our culture. The suppressed portions of her character - her anger, her need to be given to and cared for, and her need to control others - express themselves with a vengeance in her fantasy life, in her unconscious behaviors, and in her distorted perception of reality. 3. "The Thematic and Psychological Triadic Structure of Samuel Richardson's Clarissa," James L. Marra, Texas Tech University. (15 min.) Clarissa's title character is the paradigm for Fritz Heider's theory of psychological balance and for Leon Festinger's theory of cognitive dissonance. She acts and reacts according to their universal dictums for standard human behavior, and in so doing proves herself human after all. 4. "Ambivalent Resolve: Malcolm Lowry's Under the Volcano," Pamela Nevels, Texas A&amp;M University. (15 min.) If the "death instinct" had been left unhindered by the evolutionary advent of intelligence, humanity could reach this goal, death, more efficiently and with more resolve, but with intelligence came creativity, the "life instinct," or Eros. In Malcolm Lowry's Under the Volcano. Geoffrey Firmin is on his own course for death. This is pervasive throughout, but in context of the conflict between life and death, it shows specifically in his loss of creativity his calling his work "Secret Knowledge" to cover his deficiency, his returning to Oaxaca - his seeking a former state, and in his sexual disinterest - a denial of the most specific sense of Eros. THE SOUTH CENTRAL BULLETIN 75 Fall, 1981</page><page sequence="29">76 THE SOUTh CENTRAL BULLETIN Fall, 1961 5. 'The Psychology of William James in Nathanael West's Miss Lonelyhearts," Carroll Schoenewolf, Stephen F. Austin University. (15 min.) Miss Lonelyhearts experiences a religious conversion which corresponds, step by step, to the descriptions of religious conversion in James' Varieties of Religious Experience. He progresses from a certain subliminal urge to a deep awareness of evil and then into a pathological depression, all of which lead to a surrender to Christ. But while James sees religious conversion as good and as meaningful, West strongly suggests that it might be evil. FRIDAY EVENING 8:00-10:00 p.m. SCIENCE FICTIONAND FANTASY- Colorado [Special Session] Chairman: Marilyn Stall Fontane, Arkansas State University Secretary: Elbert R. Hill, Southeastern Oklahoma State University 1. "Ray Bradbury's Positronic Robot," Joe R. Christopher, Tarleton State University. (25 min.) Two short stories- Isaac Asimov's "Robbie" (1940) and Ray Bradbury's "I Sing the Body Electric" (1969) - have seven likenesses in plot and theme which, while not necessarily proving Bradbury's indebtedness to Asimov (Bradbury denies it), at least reveal some strong similarities between these modern science fiction stories - and thus show common attitudes in the science fiction community. 2. "Ursula Le Guin's Contribution to Science Fiction: The Final Stage of Growth," Forrest M. Byrd, The University of Southwestern Louisiana. (25 min.) The emergence of Ursula Le Guin on the science fiction and fantasy scene necessitates a fresh look at the genre and its future. Le Guin is certainly not a permutation of the original "hardware" science fiction, and neither does she seem derivative of the "new wave." Her most recent novel may offer a Beginning Place for such a look. 3. "Frank Herbert's Ecological Fugue," Richard F. Patteson, Mississippi State University. (25 min.) Virtually the entire corpus of Frank Herbert's work is united by a remarkably consistent, integral vision - a comprehensive world-view in which various systemic relationships connect humanity and human institutions to the physical and biological universe out of which man evolved. This philosophical outlook is part of a broader ecological trend in contemporary culture. The Dune tetralogy is Herbert's most successful exploration of the vital links between man and world, but all of his fiction is shaped by the same vision, and all of his novels take place in the same interrelated cosmos. 4. Business session. Election of officers. 5. "BEMS and Brass-Bra'd Belles: Science Fiction Covers of the 1930's and 1940's," Slide Show. (30 min.) 6. 'The Literary Function of Animal Magnetism in Poe's Mesmerism Tales," Norman E. Stafford, Arkansas State University. (20 min.) Animal Magnetism, popularly referred to as Mesmerism, provided the matrix for three of Edgar Allan Poe's tales. Critics have demonstrated that Poe's contemporaries regarded the pseudo-science seriously, that he described it accurately, and that this accurate description enhances the effect for knowledgeable readers. But no one has discussed the different function of animal magnetism in each tale. A formal analysis of the differences provides the three tales with an integrity of their own, despite the similarity of subject matter. Analyzing the differences also furthers the reader's knowledge of animal magnetism and of the artistic merits of each tale. - -- -'-- --- - ----tY ~ ~ i- t -- -- F - - - - - - - - - - =----, -,,-L- - z;=;== - - -- --- ----------- - ---,--- French &amp; European Publications, Inc.
