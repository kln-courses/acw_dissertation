Sir,?I have read with much pleasure the address o Dr. James Korie on the interactions of mind, body, and soul, which appeared in the Journal on June 18th. The deep problems which surround the transformation of nerve force into mental energy we are still compelled to recognize as ultimate facts which at present admit of no analysis. Metaphysicians formerly regarded the human mind as a sort of compound of different faculties presenting some likeness to an organic compound, and consisting of several members each discharging its own appropriate function; but during recent years a great change has taken place in the ideal forms of physiological psychology. The mind is now described as current energy, and capable of passing into various states of intellect and emotion which admit of very little experimental investi gation as to their essential nature. We may, however, be sure that psychic force will never be explored by rummag ing in the dark, and that the only possible way of knowing anything of the real nature of mind is by bringing it into contact with the objects addressed to its various feelings and faculties in the regions of experience and Ufe, by which alone they can be brought into living play. Like all modern psychologists, Dr. Rorie "begins at the other end by gradually working up from the stimuli or physical forces operating on the nerve-end organ? especially provided for the conversion of these into the nerve current?a vito-neural energy, and its transmission as such to the cerebral nerve cells. How mind acts on matter and how matter acts on mind still remain as great i a puzzle as before to all investigators." What interesting and insolvable problems surround the very beginning of human life ! We can watch the evolution, but the visible manifestations which are presented to us admit of no analysis into their constituent elements. The vibrations of the nerve ends of the special senses and other organs are mysteriously converted into neural currents, which become the incipient excitants of the neurons and nerve cells, and then follow the primitive and spontaneous move ments which indicate the first conscious awakenings and the actual beginnings of mental life. Without these stimuli from the outer world there could be no evolution of the higher faculties. The recognition of the pneuma in man appears to me to be imperative in every point of view. The brain is only a part of the machinery of the mind ; for although a large part of the current forces of mental action are within the head, other parts equally indispensable extend throughout the body. Scientific research has brought to light many great advances in neurology, but what has cerebral localiza tion done to decipher the material centres of consciousness, intellect, and emotion ? It is true that no mental life can be carried on, and that no thought or emotion can be sus tained, without the normal intercommunications between the brain and the rest of the body. But how can these facts be utilized to construct a theory that mind is only a I functional part of the material organization? Is not emotion of the most exalted kind the accompaniment of our severest and most abstract mental exercise? How can the blending of the greatest of the powers of the intellect with the highest and most vivid of the emotions be reconciled to the hypothesis of only functional activity, and that the combination can be resolved into vital and neural energies? Surely the highest forms of mental activity are something more than the products of mere molecular forces ? I am glad to know that a reaction is going on to-day against the materialistic monism which is still enunciated by some physiologists, with the intention of practically obliterating the distinction between material and non</page><page sequence="2">JOLT a, igto.l_COBBESPONDENCE._JhSESSSL* 49 material neurology. Dr. James Rorie clearly states his opinion in these words : "If we are to arrive at a correct analysis of man's mental constitution, the spiritual element cannot be set aside and disregarded." 'Now, in this opinion I entirely agree ; at the same time, I am not a member of the Psycho-Physical Society, and I feel sure that the personal experiences of its members are not likely to unlock the secrets of mental science, and that their singular experimental researches, which are carried on by some with sincerity, only tend to excite morbid disturbances of the senses and to produce visual and aural hallucinations. In many cases I know that these so-called spiritual studies have resulted in serious consequences to both the physical and mental health. In conclusion, I desire to advance another step forward, in which I feel confident Dr. Rorie will cordially agree. It is my firm conviction that mind is clearly superphysical, for Nature is so conservative that she never wastes a single atom or a particle of power. Mind, from its essential nature, is an independent force, and, for all its higher mpuifestations, our nervous organization is the temporary seat of that mysterious union where spirit meets with matter and evolves all the elements of its high and hidden processes. Man is a distinct order of being by his mental capacity, and is separated from all other beings more by psychical differences than physical structure. His distinguishing attributes defy experimental investigation, and in his organic formation there is not the faintest indication of his intellectual and moral power?of that "still, small voice," the regulator of all the insurgent and inferior principles of Nature, and of that hope which calmly sees in the decay and disintegration of this present materialism the complete emancipation of the spirit and the dawn of a higher life.?I am, etc., Southsea, June 27th. JOHN WARD COUSINS. Sir,?I write to call attention to a few fallacies in natural philosophy which still cling tenaciously to the scientific mind and language, which lurk hidden in several of the articles in your series on Faith Healing, which are carefully avoided by Sir Clifford Allbutt, and which come into prominence in the paper by Dr. Glaye Shaw. 1. The vibration theory is a mere hypothesis, and it is unscientific to regard it as explaining anything. As Pro fessor Karl Pearson has been at so much pains to point out, it is only a summary in a mathematical sense of certain phenomena. It should not be regarded as an explanation of causes, and it cannot rightly be used as a premiss upon which to base any conclusion, but only to resume pheno mena investigated and detected by other means. The postulation of the ether is necessary for the understanding of the vibration hypothesis, but the ether is a concept and not a medium, and it is wrong to attempt the explanation of any phenomenon by conceiving the real existence of a medium called the ether. 2. Dr. Claye Shaw speaks of an " actual emanation of force " and of latent force becoming objective. This would attach to force an existence, giving to it a personality differing only in name from the spirits of things in the demonology of the ancients. Such an anthropomorphic idea can have no place in the physical science of to-day. It seems necessary to go back upon the foundations of physics and to state that force is merely the name given to a process of equalization which takes place through certain interposed resistances between bodies in a state of relative inequality, this tendency to equalization being a primal quality of matter. Force is a process having velocity or relation with time and space, but in regard to which no question of quality, amount, objectiveness or latency, is relevant. This is no doubt a surprising remark, but it is nevertheless true. Who has measured the quality, amount, objectiveness, or latency of force, otherwise than in terms of the inequality between substances ? 3. " Can living matter affect other living matter at a distance by means of a change in the medium between the two, apart from the agency of known conductors ? ; This brings up the old controversy about action at a distance. How can a thing act where it is not, is the question asked. Of course it cannot, is the answer. We must assume the existence of a connecting link between the interacting substances and call it a conductor. I now make the I statement that there are no conductors, as usually under stood, conveying particular kinds of force from one sub stance to another. Every interposed substance between interacting bodies is a resistance which impedes, and does not assist, a reaction. Of course, a body cannot transfer its own motion to another unless it touches it, and the transmission of motion is the only form of conduction. It is this fact which has given rise to the erroneous state ment that all physical states are modes of motion. Con duction has been assumed?a medium has been imagined, and the theory " motion " has been arrived at. A conclu sion based upon two assumed premisses. Can it be good ? These and many other false conclusions which now pass as the facts of physics require deep and thoughtful recon sideration. This is neither the time nor the place for me to attempt to substantiate an indictment against the false phraseology and erroneous ideas to which I desire merely to call an opportune attention.?I am, etc, London.
