<plain_text><page sequence="1">SIVA AND DIONYSOS-VISIONS OF TERROR AND BLISS BY J. BRUCE LONG Haverford, Pa., U.S.A. It will be our purpose in this essay to describe and interpret certain 'divine modalities' or 'modes of manifestation' which two deities possess in common-Rudra-Siva in India and Dionysos in ancient Greece. It is our belief that the character of these gods whose worship sprang out of and was nurtured by cultures which are widely divergent in time and place, form homologous or parallel structures of religious experience and expression. It will be our contention that these two divine modanities manifest certain religious significances which are at once historical and transhistorical, traits which are both Greek and Indian, on the one hand, and fundamentally human, on the other. We feel that by providing such a phenomenological and structural analysis of their personalities, deeds and cults as manifested in their respective mythologies, we shall augment, not diminish the religious significance of each. The precise reasons and causes for this parallelism are profound and complex. Like any other formative and long-lived religious tradition, the roots of these two cults, the socio-religious causes of their appear- ance, and the laws governing their development elude the grasp of the scholar. We might suggest, however, that such a parallelism arises, in part, from the fact that the cults of both gods developed in similar fashions at the earliest stages, that they sprang up among peoples having attained approximately the same type of cultural and social level, and that, reflecting as they do certain religious truths which their devotees cherished, they represent similar or homologous apprehensions of Divine and human reality. We freely admit that the use of the method of structural compara- tivism or comparative phenomenology in interpreting religious data (where no signs of cross-cultural influence are forthcoming) will inevitably lead to a certain distortion of the material. We maintain,</page><page sequence="2">Siva and Dionysos I8I nevertheless, that such an approach, if used advisedly and with due caution, will elucidate certain religious meanings in the material which otherwise would not come to light. I. GENERAL REMARKS CONCERNING SIVA AND DIONYSOS The Vedic god Rudra of whom 'Siva' (Auspicious One) was used in the beginning either as an euphemistic epithet or a laudatory invocation of his more benevolent side, appears in the Rig Veda as a slightly exaggerated form of Varuna. Varuna, the god of law and order in both the cosmic and human realms, inspired in his devotees both dread and delivery from the dreadful, both fear and redemption from the fearful. Rudra, by contrast, inspires, for the most part, only fear and in a most curious manner, a paradoxical fascination for the terrible. He is, in the famous nomenclature of Rudolf Otto, the numinous par excellence, the mysterium tremendum who provokes feelings of tremen- dum as well as fascinosum. As god of the tempest, he is father and leader of the Maruts or Rudras, gods of the storm-winds who are as destructive as they are creative. Rudra, a name interpreted by the great Vedic com- mentators,, Yiska 1) and Sayana as meaning "the Howler", is closely associated with the Vedic raingod Indra and with the highly venerated god of fire, Agni. 2) In connection with all manner of meteorological phenomena, Rudra is the awful and terrifying god of the tempest who crackles and howls in the wake of the monsoon rains. He is the Divine Archer 3) (?arva, RV I.II4.Io; 2.33.14) who sends his shafts (larva) I) Nirukta io.8: "Rudra is (so-called) because he bellows (rauti) or because he runs about (dravati) vociferating (intens. of V ru) or is derived from the causal of rud, to roar." See Sayana's list of six native etymologies for Rudra on RV I.114.1 in John Muir's Original Sanskrit Text on the Origin and History of the People of India, their religions and institutions (5 vols.; London: Trubner &amp; Co., 1868-74) IV, 3o0i. 2) For a complete presentation of the theories concerning the etymology of the name "Rudra", see Jan Gonda, Vedisme et Hindousmne Ancien, Vol. I of Les Religions de L'Inde. Paris: Payot, 1962, pp. Io6ff. 3) Sarva is a new name assigned to Rudra in V.S. XVI 18.28. The AV refers to Sarva with destructive lightning four times. This Rudra-Sarva of Vedic religion is markedly reminiscent of a deity who appears in the Zend-Avesta as "Saurva" who occupied the Indo-European "third function" in providing moisture and fecundity in both plants and animals according to the tripartite system of George Dumezil. On the basis of the fact that both Rudra-Sarva and his Indo- Iranian predecessor both carry the same weapon (Garva= arrow), provide moisture for all growing things and cause feelings of awe and even insecurity in all men</page><page sequence="3">182 J. Bruce Long streaking through the atmosphere, bringing sickness, 'fever, cough and poison' (AV 2.2.22) and disaster upon whomever it strikes. He is invoked as 'the great Asura of Heaven' (RV 2.1.6) 4) because of the fact that he instills even in the other gods the fear of ruin and death. So wrathful and unpredictable is he that even the propitiations of his devotees may provoke his anger if not performed with meticulous accuracy. 5) While in the Rig Veda, Rudra is a ferocious anti-god 'spitting like a wild beast' (RV 2.33.2) in the later Vedas and Brahmanas, his ferocious nature is even more accentuated. For example, in the Vijasaneyi- sarihhiti of the Sukla-Yajurveda (Sect. XVI) there is a famous litany traditionally known as the Satarudriya, addressed to Rudra in his hundred forms surrounded by his ghoulish retinue. 6) He appears in this text as a killer whose form is 'black, swarthy, murderous and fear- ful'; a robber, cheat and deceiver; the lord of thieves and robbers'. He is also a deliverer and saviour. His arrows are said to bring with them both diseases of all sorts and antidotes for those diseases. He has a healing (besaja) and an auspicious (?iva) body, which makes its power- ful presence felt in all departments of the natural world. As is evident Rudra is described here as incorporating a startling collection of para- doxical and incongruous, grotesque and terrifying attributes. 7) In the Svet5ivatara Upanisad (a text in which Rudra-Siva is un- ambiguously identified with the Brahman of Vedanta) the name 'Siva' ceases to be used euphemistically and comes to designate Rudra's total essence as High God. s) His most important modes of appearance in the Mahabhhrata are: Pdsupati (Lord of Cattle), rma.Sanavdsin (In- (even in their respective devotees), we feel led with R. C. Zaehner (Dawn and Twilight of Zoroastrianism, New York, 1961) in viewing this name as designating the same deity in Iran and India as expressive of the daemonic side of Divinity. 4) Whether the term "asura" indicated an anti-god or demon at this time is difficult to determine. 5) RV II.33.4: "Let us not anger Thee with imperfect worship." 6) The fact that this litany dedicated to Rudra is still chanted today, makes it one of the most ancient and long-lived hymns in the history of religions. 7) Many of these character traits were undoubtedly assimilated by Rudra from various local folk or tribal cults during the period intervening between the Rig Veda and the Upanisads. 8) Rudra is addressed as the High God Siva for the first time in the Svet5Ava- tara Upani~ad. In this text he has allocated to him all the appellations, traits and functions of Brahman and is himself identified with the impersonal, all-embracing divine principle of Vedanta.</page><page sequence="4">Siva and Dionysos 183 habitant of the Burning Ground), Mahayogin or Yogeivara (Lord of Yogins and Ascetics). In the Purinas and Agamas, the bi-polar nature of Siva becomes even more definite and more central to the meaning of his character. He appears to his followers in an androgynous and ithyphallic form as Umapati (Consort of Ama, daughter of the moun- tain) and Ardhanarivara (Lord Who is Half Female). He incorporates within his own complex person the marks of both male and female sexes, a Divine Totality who procreates, sustains and destroys the universe by his own powers without the necessity of resorting to any agency outside himself. He is called Hari-Hara ( a composite form of Visnu as Creator-Preserver and Siva as Destroyer), a divine modality which embodies another type of bi-polarism-that of creation and destruction. He is ?iva-?akti, a form in which the two genders are merged with the female element taking the dominant role. Finally he is a mighty warrior and a valiant leader of the divine troops (ganapati), universally exalted for certain heroic feats: (I) consumption of poison left over from churning the ocean, (2) destruction of the citadels of the three demons (tripurasuramardini), (3) destruction of Daksa's Horse Sacrifice (Daksayafifamardini), and (4) support of the goddess of the Ganges in his flowing locks (Gaigadharam). What had begun as mere ambivalence and unpredictability in the character of Rudra, is transformed in the Siva of the Epics and Purinas, into a complete coincidence of contraries. Briefly, Dionysos is taken by most scholars, both ancient and con- temporary, 9) to be a Thracian god of fertility and procreation whose cult was introduced to the Greek mainland between the 7th and 6th centuries B.C. 10o) As the source and dispenser of fecundating powers, his mysterious presence was felt in all segments of the natural world. 11) His vocation in the Hellenic world was begun as god of vegetation in general and was particularly associated with trees of various sorts (the pine, the spruce and the fig.) 12) Along with other Hellenic deities he is addressed as A~vapiVS or "EvsEV~po4, 'he who 9) W.

In Boeotia he is called, 'he who lives and works in trees'; 13) but his lordship over procreation and nutrition was extended to include all living things: animal, plant and mineral. The special accouterments which he himself carried and which were borne by his followers during festival time, give clear testimony to this facet of his personality; among them are: the thrysus topped with sprigs of ivy and a pinecone; branches of various types of trees; the phallus; kraters or chalices filled with wine; and his many animal emblems. As his cult became more and more firmly established in Greece, he became more specifically identified as the wine-god. 14) He was the raving god whose appearance drove his devotees mad and incited them to perform ghastly actions, even ritual murder. Mysterious dedications invoked him as Lord of Souls, and as the confidant and guide of the Dead. 15) He was the god of most blessed ecstasy who, by means of the gifts of dance, drink and music, brought his worshippers into closest mystical union with his spirit. He was the embodiment of ecstatic joy and dementing terror, of animal wildness and untamed vitality, the god of terrifying presence and of most blessed deliverance, an enigmatic god whose character showed a dual nature. Born of a human mother and a divine father, he incorporated in his person the most incongruous and unpredictable sets of contraries. Finally, Dionysos, as inhabitant of the lower world and of all sorts of subterranean regions on earth (pools of water, caves, etc.) also performed services of divination. Euripides problaims that 'the god is a great prophet, for madness and the Bacchic inspiration have great power of soothsaying'. 16) His service was clouded by mystery and his priest delivered oracles in a state of ecstasy; but the god communicated with his devotees more directly through the medium of dreams. 17) II. STRUCTURAL PARALLELS IN THE CHARACTER AND CULT OF GIVA AND DIONYSOS A.

We should not be sur- prised, therefore, to find that such gods manifest within themselves various facets and guises which are difficult to interrelate according to any rational pattern. We can explain this diversity of aspects only by viewing them as products of a lengthy evolution in which many local or territorial gods were "universalized" or grafted onto the "parochial" forms of divinity in the composition of their multifaceted characters. 19) The debate as to whether Rudra-Siva's origins were Aryan or non- Aryan, Vedic or non-Vedic has been raging for years. The study of the origins of Saivism has been aided but little by many of the theories which have been spun out to settle this perplexing issue. While North Indian Hindi-speaking and European scholars have argued that Rudra- ,iva's roots lie within the context of the Indo-European, Vedic, Sans- kritic religious tradition and that the roots of both 'Rudra' and 'Siva' are to be derived directly from the Sanskrit, South Indian Tamil- speaking scholars have asserted that his roots lie in south India and that the name 'Siva' is derived from a Tamil root. 20) The situation was complicated greatly with the discovery of the famous steatite seal at the Indus-Valley site of Harappi which shows a figure seated in a "yogic" position, surrounded by various animals and sporting what appear to be three faces-all of these traits characteristic of Siva from the time of the Mahibhirata onwards. 21) We find it most difficult to place full credence in the view of Sir John Marshall that this figure on the seal is a so-called "proto-Siva". As J. Gonda has so convincingly argued in his Change and Continuity in Indian Religion, 22) while we 18) Many of these character traits undoubtedly were assimilated by these gods from various local folk or tribal cults as their worship became more popularized and geographically widespread. 19) McKim Marriott, "Little Communities in an Indigenous Civilization", Village India (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, I955), PP. 171-222. 20) Those scholars who seek to derive the names Rudra and Siva from Sanskrit sources, harken back to such native scholars as Yiska and Si;yana, in tracing Rudra to V rud, to cry or wail and Siva to V liv, to be gracious or auspicious. Those who favor a Tamil derivation trace the name Siva back to a root V liv, red or ruddy. 21) Sir John Marshall, Mohenjo Daro and the Indus Civilization. 3 vols., London, I931. 22) Jan Gonda, Change and Continuity in Indian Religion.

Bruce Long may not be justified in rejecting completely the notion that this figure is a "proto-Siva", there are too many questions and difficulties involved in giving the theory full acceptance. Nor do we find convincing the essay by R. N. Dandekar, entitled, "Rudra in the Vedas", 23) in which the proposal is made that Rudra was originally a non-Vedic, Dravidian "God of the Dead" whose cult was accepted with great reluctance by the priests of the Vedic hier- archical religion when they were confronted with a militantly advancing cult which threatened to overshadow the accepted Vedic system. He attempts to fortify this contention by invoking Rudra's irascible and terrifying nature, his capacity to inflict with disease and death and the supposed Tamil derivation of the name "Siva". He also makes mention of the fact that whereas most of the other Vedic gods are linked in pairs for specific purposes, Rudra is unrelated to any other god except Soma in a single hymn. (RV VI. 74). To attempt a refutation of all these points would take us far beyond the limits of this paper. Suffice to say that, point for point, there is opposing evidence to indicate an Aryan and a Vedic origin for Rudra and evidence which is more sound, less speculative than that which Dandekar brings forth. One thing seems to us to be decisive. One of Rudra's principle modes of manifestation in the Vedas is '~arva' or 'the Divine Archer'. 24) This Rudra-Sarva is markedly reminiscent of 'Sarva' or 'Saurva', the god of the divine sheath in the Avesta. 25) This god, like Rudra-Sarva shoots arrows which bring disease and death and betrays a most ambivalent attitude towards mankind. On the basis of these two facts, we are led to argue that the Avestan and the Vedic Sarva indicate one and the same god, the latter being merely an "Indianized" version of the former. If this, in fact, is the case, then the picture which emerges is that the core of his character is Indo- Iranian and that as early as the Sukla-Yajurveda (ca. I Loo-Iooo B.C.) the somewhat strange and apparently non-Vedic elements were adopted by him from certain local non-Aryan peoples, possibly Dravidian and tribal. 26) By assimilating these traits which may have been foreign 23) Journal of the University of Poona (I953), pp. 94-148. 24) I.114.1o; II.33.Io, 14; V.42.I; VI.I6.39; VI.74.4. 25) R. C. Zaehner, Dawn and Twilight of Zoroastrianism, p. 35. 26) One might even speculate that the ecstatic and erotic elements in the Rudra- Siva cult were drawn from such non-Aryan, indigenous layers of society.</page><page sequence="8">Siva and Dionysos I87 to the Vedic cult, Rudra's position was solidified in the new environ- ment and the native peoples who were conquered by the invading Aryans were placated and acommodated by this more comprehensive and 'elitist' religious system. The fact remains, however, that although Rudra is essentially Aryan and Vedic in character, he is often given a less hospitable reception by the Vedic priesthood. He seems on occasion to be more feared than loved. It may have been the early and rapid assimilation of the elements of indigenous cults and the baleful and destructive side of his nature that accounts for the discrimination against him in the Vedic texts. The presence of many non-Brahmanical elements in his nature is supported by the testimony of the texts that he inhabited hills and forests belonging to various tribal peoples (notably the Nisadhas) and that he was addressed as the patron of thieves, outcasts, cheats, land-grabbers and highwaymen. 27) Again, he is represented as the lord of both beasts and cattle (mrga and padu) and was closely identified with a wild tribe of hunters (Nisadhas) who also were robbers and fishers. Many textual references link him with certain non-Brahmanical cults, such as the munis and yogis and in the fifteenth chapter of the Atharvaveda, he is said to be the lord of the "Vrityas". Finally, he is often associated with serpent worship and fertility and water spirits such as Yaksas-all common features of non-Brahmanical worship. 28) Even though Rudra emerged from obscurity in the post-vedic times and took on many features of a 'High God', he was not, even then, venerated unambiguously as a 'high-caste' deity. The Satapatha Brih- mana (I.7.3.1) states that the other gods (devas) went up to heaven and ignored Rudra (= padupati); whereupon, this Padupati rose up in anger, raised his weapon in the north (the direction which is sacred to him as Giriga, lord of mountains) and struck them with terror. So terrified were the other gods that they finally resigned themselves to admitting Rudra to the yariia-offerings, for previously he has been restricted to receiving the bali-offerings only. In the G.rhyasiitras 29) there is a bull sacrifice called 'filagava', the after-effects of which were 27) Cf. Tait. Sarhh. IV.5.I-II; Vij. Sarhh.

Bruce Long so polluting that the devotees were commanded to perform the rite out- side the limits of the village and bury the residue there. The most convincing evidence for the late adoption of Rudra-Siva into the Brahmanic pantheon and his tardy acceptance by the priesthood, is found in the story of Siva's rejection from the great Horse Sacrifice (Hayamedha) of Daksa, his father-in-law in the Epic. s0) All the gods (devas), demi-gods (Gandharvas and Apsaras), and even the anti-god (Daityas and Danavas) had been invited to the festive event on the "breast of Himavat". Only Siva had been excluded. Enraged by this blasphemous act, Siva created from the white-hot potency of his own being, a demonic creature, Virabhadra, who in turn, destroyed Daksa's sacrifice and threatened to consume the entire world with it. In fear for the preservation of the world, Daksa performed penance to Siva and sought his blessings by intoning his Ioo8 divine names; at which time Siva was invited to partake in the fruits of Daksa's sacrifice which had been restored. Except for a few slight deviations, we find much the same situation obtaining in the introduction of the cult of Dionysos on the mainland of Greece. The main difference is that while the 'non-Establishment' elements in Siva's character were native to the indigenous tribes of India, the non-Olympian elements in Dionysos were imported into Greece from the outside-Thrace and Phrygia to the north and Asia Minor to the east. Most scholars agree that Euripide's Bacchae is a dramatic representation of the folly which fell on all those in Greece who turned their backs on Dionysos and refused to accept him as a legitimate son of Zeus. 31) Dionysos himself declares, "the men of Thebes blasphemed me. They slandered me; they said I came of mortal man. These crimes his people whom I cherished well did from malice to their benefactor. Therefore, I now disclose the sufferings in store for them." 32) Again, he shouts as he enters the palace courtyard at Thebes, "For I have come to refute that slander spoken by my mother's sisters (who) said I was 30) Mahabharata (Trans. by P.

So Dionysos, enraged by these slander- ous rejections of his cult, vowed to prove to every man in Thebes, by whathever means necessary, that he is divine and that his cult is holy. All these facts and many more indicate that Dionysos is not native to the Greek mainland. This fact is recognized by almost every scholar, ancient and modern-W. F. Otto being the single interesting excep- tion. 34) In two places in the Bacchae 35) he is referred to as a Divine Stranger, as though he had recently arrived from alien parts. Pentheus himself declares that he will drive Dionysos and his revel rout from Thebes by military might "whoever Dionysos may be". By his own admission in the opening lines of the drama, Dionysos is returning to his homeland in Thebes, after having journeyed from Lydia and Phrygia across the steppes of Persia, "through Bactrian fastness and grim waste of Media, to rich Arabia and to Greece". 36) In Homer Dionysos is not yet an Olympian divinity. On the Parthenon frieze he takes his place among the seated, rather than the standing, gods. Somewhere between the time of Homer and Pheidias, his accep- tance into the fold of Greek civic religion had been completed. 37) In the Iliad (VI. I30ff.) we read that Lycurgus, a Thracian king, son of Dryas, was "not long in life, he of old who raised 'gainst gods his hand". The Nursing Nymphs of Dionysos first blinded him with their holy wands and then 'plunged him 'neath the salt sea wave'. The essential thing in the story of the murder of Lycurgus, the factor which recurs again and again, is the rage against the dominance of a new god, "the blind mad fury, the swift helpless collapse at the touch of a real force." 38) 33) 11. 25-3o. 34) Consult footnote number 9 above. 35) 11. 233 and Io42. 36) Bacchae, 13-15, 86. 37) Jane E.

Bruce Long The testimony of Greek historians (most notably Herodotus, VIII. IIo) confirms the view that Dionysos was a late immigrant to Greece by linking him with certain barbaric hill-tribes in Thrace, 39) Hero- dotus identifies the Satrae as a wild, unconquered hill-tribe, whose livelihood consisted in highway-robbery, land-grabbing and brigandage of all sorts. Strabo 40) knows them as the fiercest of robber-tribes who lived on and around Mt. Haemus and reports that they were "called brigands by the brigands". Here among those splendid unconquerable savages in their mountain fastnesses was the real home of the god Dionysos. One final piece of evidence must be mentioned. Jane Harrison 41) describes a design from an amphora of the 6th century B.C. which pictures eight gods in a line, four on either side of Zeus, the latter deity being in the process of giving birth to Athena. Dionysos is situated at the extreme left side of the picture, "markedly aloof from the main section". She attributes great significance to the subordinate position of Dionysos and notes that "Hermes seems to come as a messenger to the furtherest verge of Olympus to tell him the news. At the right, the other Northerner, Apollo, occupies the last place." As we noticed in the case of Rudra-Siva, so with Dionysos: the intro- duction of his cult into the mainstream of the Hellenic religious tradition created great social and spiritual upheavals. His ambivalent nature, the mystical nature of the experience to which he led those who surrendered their wills in his, and the wild, uncultured orgiastic rites which were employed to achive the desired union with the god appear to be aberrant and untamed when placed within the context of Olympian civic religion. Just as the cult of Rudra-Siva, with its worship of phallic and serpent deities, its connection with groves and local cult-places did not belong originally to the mainstream of Brahmanic tradition, but to the alien 39) Although the traditional scholarly opinion is that Dionysos migrated to the mainland of Greece from the Thracian hills in the north and from Asia Minor to the East, there is that most perplexing appearance of his name in the listing of deities in Linear B. Whether he was a god of vegetation or fertility in general, whether he had any connections with bulls or serpents (as did the Cretan Zeus), or whether there was an independent cult to Dionysos, is not clear. We know only that a certain deity called Dionysos had sufficient status in Crete between the I2th and Ioth centuries B.C. to be included in a pantheonic list. Cf. W. K. C.

In each instance, the god and his cult was adopted by the established tradition (Brahmanic and Olym- pian) only after some of the more radical, irrational and aberrant traits and practices had been softened or deleted entirely by the hierarchical priesthood. B. Their Modes of Manifestation The Sacred or the Holy never appears in the natural and finite world in its pure and primal essence. In order for it to appear at all, for it to express its nature and meaning, it must necessarily become embodied in or speak through a form or structure within the temporal-spatial world. Conversely, mankind cannot encounter or become conversant with the Sacred except by becoming open and sensitive to those media through which he is addressed. Once he has been addressed by the Sacred and has discovered that his own small world is not closed off from the cosmos, that man is compelled to give expression through myths and symbols to that "word" which he has received from powers lying beyond the limits of his immediate environment and, thereby, make its nature and meaning known to the wider community. In order to preserve this privileged meeting with the Sacred Powers and to keep it from being lost in the shades of forgetfulness, the one who was addressed seeks to invest this 'faceless Power' with a name, with per- sonal characteristics such as ideas, values and attitudes-in a word, to anthropomorphize the Sacred. Thus, the media through which the Sacred first spoke to him are 'solidified,' so to speak, and are established objectively in symbols, myths and ritual gestures to serve as points of encounter in the future. Hence, we can derive a great deal of insight into the nature of a people's religious beliefs by analyzing the modes or forms through which their god appears to them and, on the other side, those forms in which men symbolize that experience. In like manner, we can determine the nature of the deity--whether he is kind and generous, or wrathful and niggardly in his dealings with men-and in what ways his devotees relate to him. Once again we find a great many points of similarity between the natures of Siva and Dionysos with respect to their modes of manifestation.</page><page sequence="13">192 J. Bruce Long In the Rig Veda, Rudra has attributed to him the traits of brilliance, effulgence and radiance that are given to all the other divinities. He charges through the middle region of the universe seated on a charioi (II. 33.II), an image which presumably indicates that he rides on the back of the winds as lord of the tempest. His limbs are firm and his lips are beauiful. (II. 33.9) Like Piisan, another god with solar attri- butes who is lord of paths and guide to travellers, Rudra has strands of long flowing hair, braided and rolled up on top of his head to form a cowrie-shell configuration. This latter trait is reminiscent of the fashion in which many non-Aryan, tribal peoples and the ascetic munis wore their hair. He carries various weapons which possess the same ambivalent powers to heal and destroy as he himself does: the thunder- bolt, a club, bow and arrows, and an unspecified 'sharp weapon' (VII. 29.5; X. 125.6). He possesses all the martial virtues that one normally associates with military deities. He is said to be vigorous (I. 33.4,8), fierce (II.33.9), youthful (II. 33.II), impetuous (II. 33.I4), swift (V. 52.16) and a mighty bull (II. 33.6). In numerous hymns he appears as the awesome (ugra) form of Agni, blazing in the sky like a hundred suns. In the Satarudriya litany mentioned earlier, he manifests himself in the most awful and grotesque fashion. He is yellow-haired (as is Dionysos), ruddy, tall and dwarfish at the same time. He encompasses all forms and has the power to appear in any form that he wishes. He is invoked as 'mountain dweller' (giritra) and 'lord of the mountain' (girda). He is described as fierce and deformed (viripa) as he is seen running about madly through the forest in the company of wild animals, wearing the skins of those which he has slaughtered-especially tigers, elephants and buffaloes. Again, he carries in his hands various weapons of destruction, such as the thunderbolt (vijaya), the trident (tridala), an iron lance (ayaktlikah), a noose (paiah), and a battle axe (paradu). As the form of Bhairava ('the Terrible') he is surrounded by wild, howling dogs which swallow their victims without chewing them. In the Mahibhhrata his ambivalence and unpredictability are even more pronounced. He is blue-throated from performing the salutary act of consuming the poison left over from the churning of the cosmic ocean. 42) As Mahiyogin ('Great Yogin' he has three eyes (representing 42) Mahibhirata, Adiparvan, sect. 18.</page><page sequence="14">Siva and Dionysos I93 the sun, moon and sacrificial fire respectively), the central of which is both the eye of spiritual insight and divine wisdom on the one hand, and of terrifyingly destructive power, on the other. It was from this eye on the forehead that he shot the 'cosmic ray' which consumed to ashes Kama, the God of Love, for disturbing his yogic-meditation. 43) Again, he is the god who inhabits the burning ground (?makinavasin) whose appearance with his ghoulish retinue is sudden and horrifying, causing pandemonium and panic among his devotees. His coming is often announced with the mysterious sounds of drums, flutes and cymbals. Around his neck is a necklace of skulls which he gathers from the funeral pyres. A single skull sits at the base of his platted locks. He rubs his body with the ashes of the dead when performing the ferocious and destructive Tandava dance in the crematoria and commands his attendants to do likewise. As the embodiment of the powers of creation and dissolution, he is Hara-Hara (a composite of Siva and Visnu) whose body is terrific (ghora) on the one side and benign (saumya) on the other. He rides in procession on a bull named Nandi ('Blissful One') and may himself appear in bull form (vrsamitrti). He is the god of the phallus (lihigam), the organ through which he performs all activities in promoting the natural process-creation, preservation and destruction. In the middle ages (ca. 6th or 7th centuries A.D.) the phallus became his most pervasive forms of manifestation and one of his sects (the Liighyats) wear the Li~igam around their necks as an emblem of their faith. In summary, Siva is said to possess many faces which he employs at different times to fulfill various purposes. In the hymn of loo8 names, the sage Upamanyu declares, Thou hast a face like that of Nandi, Thou has a face that is terrible, (ghora) Thou hast a handsome, thou hast an ugly face, (viripa) Thou art without a face. (niimarti) Thou hast four faces, and Thou hast a fiery face when engaged in battle. 44) Dionysos, like Giva is a composite of many contraries-in appearance and in personality. In Euripides' Bacchae, he appears in the guise of a young man; he is handsome, youthful and courageous. In the stage 43) Mahibhirita, Anu ianaparvan, sect. 14o, 23 ff. 44) Mahibhirata, Sntiparvan, sect. 285. 84-85. NUMEN XVIII 13</page><page sequence="15">I94 J. Bruce Long directions he is described as having "a soft, even effeminate appear- ance." 45) His face is beardless and he is dressed in the customary fawn-skin which he wears in the company of the frenzied dancers who attend him. In his hand he carries the thrysus (a stalk of fennel) tipped with ivy leaves and a pine cone. It is this concealment of a pine cone or spear-point beneath the sprigs of ivy which is used to injure or kill those who provoke his wrath, which indicates most clearly the ambivalent mixture of benevolence and malevolence in his nature. His head is draped with a wreath of ivy or a snake (Siva also wears serpents draped around his head, neck or body) and a cascade of long blond curls ripple down his shoulders, which, like the long flowing braids of Siva, twirl about his head as he performs the whirling cultic dance. Through- out the drama he wears a smiling mask which, again, conceals his truly ferocious and demonic nature. King Pentheus, who now occupies the throne of Thebes and vows to conquer the drunken followers of Dionysos with his military might, provides a most vivid account of the appearance of this god from Thrace, I am also told a foreigner has come to Thebes from Lydia, one of those charlatan magicians with long yellowish curls smelling of perfumes, with flushed cheeks and the spells of Aphrodite in his eyes. His days and nights he spends with women and girls, dangling before them the joys of initiation in his mysteries. 46) Dionysos may appear with a bull or in the form of a bull. The wine cup, a cutting of ivy and a phallus may serve as his emblem. His appearance is both pacific and terrifying, is known by his devotees to be both beneficent and malevolent, both loving and hateful towards whomever he chooses. Like Giva, he carries a noose for the purpose of ensnaring his enemies or gaining military advantage by force. 47) Again, we get a picture of him that is very reminiscent of Giva as he dances with wildest abandon through the forests and glens and on the sides of mountains, clothed in the skins of animals which he and his retinue have devoured (e.g. fawn, he-goats, bulls). With the light of flaming 45) Arrowsmith, Ibid., p. 543; see also lines 234-40, 353, 453. 46) lines 233-38. 47) Bacchae, lO1g.</page><page sequence="16">Siva and Dionysos I95 torches opening a path through the darkness, he and his revelers race and dance to the accompaniment of the thunderous beat of the kettle- drum, the shrill cry of flutes and the savage shouts of his comrades. C. Places of Residence Since some mention has been made of the abodes of these gods in other connections, we need only touch on the topic here. As we noticed before, in the Satarudriya hymn Rudra is invoked as Giritra ('he who lives in the hills') and as Girida ('lord of mountains'). Elsewhere, he is seen abiding in the woods, forests, glens, in both wooded and deserted wastes far from human settlements; he haunts lonely roads and en- counters travelers at intersections (which are, in India, as elsewhere, most inauspicious places frequented by evil spirits and robbers). He is both lord and comrade of such outcastes as thieves, scoundrels, cheats and land-grabbers. In the same hymn, he is said to be "seen by herdsmen and young girls who come to the wells to draw water" out from the village. We should also recall that the bull-sacrifice (?lagava) was to be performed at a great distance from places inhabited by human beings and domesticated animals so as to guard such places from the evil effects of this rite. He shares with Puisan the lordship over paths and roads to distant places and over travelers who busy these routes. Finally, in the Great Epic, Siva as Mahtyogin, is the patron deity of those who abide in the forest (vanaprasthas) and of wandering ascetics. He lives with his consort, Pirvati, on Mt. Kailisa (elsewhere, Mt. Meru) in the north where, along with their attendants, they engage in frivolous play (1U1) and ascetic penances (tapas). Again, he is seen dancing in the crematoria (i~maSana) which always lie in lonely and deserted areas, in the company of ghosts and goblins. Like his Indian counterpart, Dionysos lived on mountains and hill- tops, in forests and grassy glens. He allured his female devotees from the 'shuttle and the loom' and from their household duties to idyllic shaded spots beneath the jagged rocks of rugged cliffs. In such places Dionysos and his Maenads ('mad' or 'holy' women) danced and sang to the pandemonius accompaniment of drums, flutes and cymbals and feasted on the still-warm flesh of a goat or fawn which they had slaughtered with their bare hands. The scene of his residence is vividly described in the Bacchae as the Chorus calls the women of Thebes to the revels of the wine-god,</page><page sequence="17">I96 f. Bruce Long ... O city, with boughs of oak and fir, come dance the dance of god! Fringe your skins of dappled fawn with tufts of twisted wool! Handle with holy care the violent wand of god! And let the dance begin! He is Bromius who runs to the mountain! to the mountain! where the throng of women waits, driven from shuttle and loom, possessed by Dionysos! 48) Again, he is depicted in this drama as 'lord of hunters', 'master of the chase'; it is he who hunts wild animals and delights in their raw-flesh. As noted earlier, he was probably the god of a war-like tribe called the Satrae who lived in the remote hills of Thrace and maintained their livelihood by brigandage. D. Animal and Serpentine Associations The particular animal with which a god is associated or in which he is embodied depends, in part, upon those animals to which the people pay particular heed either in the form of fear or veneration. As students of comparative mythology have long recognized, the nature and actions of a deity do often reflect directly the life-style and values of those who worship him. If a people is most fascinated by the eagle, most fright- ened by the lion or most ingratiated by the cow, it is most likely that this Divinity will present himself to men in that animal guise. In India, Siva most generally is associated with the buffalo, the elephant or the tiger; but, from Vedic times on, he was most particularly related to the bull. In Greece, Dionysos, on different occasions, might appear in the form of a bull, a leopard or a lion, though he is also known to take up abode in a he-goat or an ass as well. 49) In an article entitled, "Siva and Dionysos", 50) Willibald Kirfel, drawing upon the thesis of Franz Altheim 51) that in prehistoric times a cult of the bull was dominant throughout the Mediterranean world, 48) 11. o09-19. 49) Otto, Ibid., 165-70. o50) Zeitschrift fiir Ethnologie.

Coomaraswamy's 52) contention that parallels exist between the iconography of ancient India and that of the Mediterranean Sea area and Western Europe in general, raises the question: is it not possible that by comparing all these iconographic forms we might not discover a connection between the cults of Siva and Dionysos by way of a common association with this ancient bull cult ? He supports an affirmative answer to this question by citing various types of evidence in literature and iconography which link both Siva and Dionysos to the bull. He concludes that the crescent moon which Siva always wears in his hair, originally designated not a lunar, but a bovine, symbolism. He reasons that, "Die Mondsichel auf Siva's Haupt hat ursprunglich mit dem Monde nichts zu tun, sondern stellt die weiss schimmernden Stierharner dar, eine Erklirung, auf die, soweit ich sehe, seltsamerweise bisher noch niemand gekommen zu sein scheint. Es handelt sich also um ein charakteristisches Merkmal, das sich seit unvordenklichen Zeiten bis auf den heutigen Tag erhalten hat und Siva uns urspriinglich als einen Stiergott kennzeichnet." 53) Since it is not the object of this paper to debate the possibility of some historical linkage or cross-cultural influence between Saivism and Dionysianism, we shall by-pass the temptation to refute Kirfel's arguments, though, frankly, we do find them far-fetched and un- convincing. All we need grant Kirfel to serve our purposes is that both Siva and Dionysos, from earliest times, have been associated with the bull and with a more comprehensive bovine symbolism which is expres- sive of such virtues as strength, prowess and fertility. We will comment on this matter only as it relates to the topic of morphological parallels between the two deities. As is well-known to Indologists, there appears on the coins and seals of ancient Indian rulers a white bull (i.e. Nandi ?) which serves as the vehicle, servant and friend of Siva and its likeness is revered by Siva's spouse, Umi-Pirvati and by his later devotees. 54) In the iconographic chapter of the Agnipurana (L. 39), Nandi appears with the attributes of a rosary and a trident as the door-guardian (dvarapala) of Siva's 52) History of Indian and Indonesian Art.

Bruce Long shrine: here in contrast to the majority of cases, his cult image is drawn in anthropomorphic form. On all the coins of Wima Kadphises (ca. A.D. 78-ca. Ilo), Siva appears attended by the predecessors of Kaniska and by his worshippers "with or without the bull, with two arms and a nimbus". 55) Certain gold pieces have been found dating from the reign of Visudeva I (ca. A.D. 185-220), the last of the rulers of the Kusina-dynasty, showing the three-faced and four-armed Siva with the bull as his attendant. 56) Not only in the plastic arts but in legend, poetry and drama as well, Siva's connection with the bull is registered. For example, in two places in the Mahibhirata 57) he is called "vrsavahana", or in III.84.129, "vrsadhvaja", "he who rides with a bull on his banner". Kalidasa, in his play entitled Kumarasackbhava (V. 80) invokes Siva as "vrsena gacchatah" ('he who rides about upon the bull") or at V. 84 he is, "vrsar~jaketana" ('the king who has the bull as his characteristic mark'). Similarly in the Garudapurana (Adhy. 55.1) Siva is addressed with the epithet, "vrsabhadhvaja". 58) As early as the Rig Veda, Rudra possesses the appellation 'the great bull' and 'the wild bull of heaven'. Like Indra, the other storm god, he is constantly referred to as a 'bull', as well as a ram (mesa). 59) If it is ever confirmed that the seated figure at Harappi is, in fact, a prefiguration of the Hindu Siva, then his close bond of kinship with the animals will have been pushed back to prehistoric times. In the Satarudriya, Rudra is again "the great bull" and "lord of cattle" (padupati). Mention should be made in this context of the bull offering (?dalagava) recorded in the Grhyasfitras. The evidence need not be multiplied further. Siva's association with serpentine figures as seen in both literature and iconography, is ancient and enduring. On the faces of early coins and in early stone sculpture he is represented as wearing serpents as body ornaments around his platted hair, on his diadem, over his right shoulder as a surrogate for the Brahmanical sacred thread (upavita) 55) Coomaraswamy, Ibid., p. 75. 56) Coomaraswamy, Ibid., p. 55, 1. 30o, fig. 126. 57) (Bombay Edition), Adiparvan, sect. 197.21. 58) Also at 55.3 and 57.8. 59) RV 1.51.</page><page sequence="20">Siva and Dionysos 199 and around his waist as a girdle. 6o) The dwarf (apasmra, lit.

Dionysos quite often manifested himself as the embodiment of the "powers of procreation" and the "powers of nutrition" by assuming the specialized form of the bull. There was nothing unusual in this, for so closely had the bull and fecundation come to be identified in ancient Greece that gods of the river and of moisture came to be known generally as taking on this bovine mode appearance. Dioinysos' bovine form reminds us again of his association with water, fecundation and procreation in general, (see next section) for the bull was considered to be the bearer of such powers in divine form. The association of the bull and water is clearly set forth by his cult, for in Argos the Bull Dionysos (3ouyEvy4 AL6vuaoo) was summoned out of the deep by trumpet blasts. 64) Dionysos was known to appear to his devotees in bovine guise, not only because of his association with the element of moisture and the powers of fertility, but because of the frenzied and terrifying manner in which he appeared to his followers and the "divine madness" and 60) Consult such standard works on Hindu Iconography as A.

Furthermore, Dionysos is addressed as "lord of animals" and as "master of the hunt". In the Bacchae 67) Agave, after slaughtering her son Pentheus, calls upon her Lord Bacchus as 'fellow huntsman,' 'comrade of the chase crowned with victory' and later expresses hope that she may convert him to the Dionysiac cult by making an inspired hunter out of him-obviously an ideal to be realized by every follower of Bacchus. He assumed the form of a bull in the jail in which Pen- theus had thrown him earlier in the guise of a young man. Again, after Dionysos had persuaded Pentheus, disguised as a Maenad himself, to witness the Bacchic revels of the crazed women, he seized the King's mind and forced him to cry out, "...you are a bull which walks before me there. Horns have sprouted from your head. Have you always been a beast ? But now I see a bull." s68) After Pentheus has been slaughtered and dismembered by the Maenads, led by his mother, Dionysos leads the King along the path to Hades in the form of a bull-calf.69) This was not Dionysos' earliest appearance in bull-form. Bull statues were not an uncommon sight in Greece according to Plutarch. 70o) Athenaeus 71) remarks that Dionysos was frequently depicted with horn and was called the 'bull' by many poets. Zagreus is overpowered and dismembered by Titans after he has undergone numerous trans- formations and has appeared in the form of a bull. 72) In the Bacchae again the women invoke their god in the woods in words reflecting an ancient incarnation, "O, Dionysos, reveal yourself a bull! Be manifest, a snake with darting head, a lion breathing fire! O Bacchus come!" They wore crowns of horns on their heads in imitation of the deity. On a vase-painting, located in the Wurzburg Museum, 73) he is pictured riding on a black bull and pouring wine from a pitcher to water the plants below.

With the juxtaposition of the bull, river-god and the bull-formed Dionysos as god of wine, the symbolic complex is complete: Dionysos-bull-wine-plants-fertility. Finally the most vived expression of this mystical relation between Dionysos and the bull is what was known in the Bacchic rites as 'Omophagia'. The women, once they had become fully possessed by the spirit of the god, became Bacchoi by ravenously devouring the raw flesh of a bull (sometimes a goat or fawn). In this way, they acquired all the powers and properties of the god which resided for the moment in that animal. The women of Elia, who called upon him in a song 74) saw him appearing as a bull, for he came only "to be killed and butchered by the mad Thyiads so that they could appropriate the power of the god to themselves". 75) His connection with serpents is equally informative. In The Bacchae, we learn that 'the bull-horned god was born of Zeus and Zeus crowned his head with snakes." (IoI) Snakes were draped around the heads and waists of the dancing Maenads and were carried about in their hands as a cultic instrument. In some cases, these serpentine head- bands are entwined with sprigs of ivy or fir branches. Both the snakes and the ivy represent chthonic powers of life and death, or procreation and destruction. As elsewhere, so in Greece, snakes lived in subter- ranean groundswells, near pools, lakes or tombs and were seen by the religious imagination as overseers of the divine treasures of life and death. E. Properties as Fertility Gods To the Greeks of the Classical Age, Dionysos was not solely or even primarily the god of wine. Plutarch says as much and confirms the claim with a quotation from Pindar (frag. 140). He was predominantly linked, in the early period of the development of his cult, at least, with forces of fertility and procreation. Some of his titles and powers attest to this function. As 'Dendrites', he is the god of vines and trees, of fir and ivy. s76) He is called 'Anthios', god of blossoming things and 'Phytal- mios', god of growth. 77) He was, again, 'Karpios', the fruit bringer, 74) Dodds, Ibid., xvii. 75) Plutarch, Mor.

His domain was every reservoir of vital energy. Plutarch again assigns to him lordship over the 'wet-element' in all living things: the running sap in the trees, the life-blood surging through the veins of young animals and the liquid fire in the grape. He was identified, in brief, with all the mysterious and uncontrollable forces which ebb and flow in all forms of life. 78) As the son of Semele, a Thracian goddess of procreation, Dionysos was the Earth, which goes through the cycles of death and rebirth annually. Most classical scholars 79) (among them Harrison and W. Otto) argue that the act of waking the baby Dionysos who is sleeping in a watery crib, performed by this nurses or Maenads, is symbolic of the resurrection of the young god who had been killed and eaten by the Titans. As 'Liknites', he is an Osiris-type god who is ritually slain and dismembered and then reborn as a small boy. The Liknites which was both a winnowing fan and a threshing floor, becomes the cradle in which the slain god is reborn. Thus, he joins such religious figures as Adonis and Osiris, Tammuz and Baal in passing through the agonies of death and the joys of resurrection with all of plant life in the natural order. 80so) We need only remind the reader that Siva, like Dionysos, was closely identified with all sorts of vegetation - trees, vines, plants, flowers, forests and groves. In the Satarudriya it is said of him that he, "Haunts the hills and is closely related to trees on which he deposits his weapons when he lays aside" (TS. IV. 5.10.4). Herman Oldenberg 81) finds a similarity between Rudra and such figures as mountain and wood deamons, sprites like Mars Silvanus, the Fauni, etc. He is the 'bull of heaven' whose fertilizing rains (i.e. male semen) fecundate the female earth. It is clear that this broad extension of Rudra's power is due to a deliberate tendency to see in him a god with a comprehensive control over nature and as the vital energies in all living things. s2), 83ss) 78) Harrison, Ibid., p. 426. 79) Farnell, Ibid., V, 123-25; Otto., Ibid., Chaps. 13 and 14. 80) Harrison, Ibid., 388 ff.; Otto.

As was the case with most other Hindu divinities in the later literature, Siva came to be identified with Prajipati, 'lord of creatures' (who created the universe by means of a cosmic sacrifice) and with Mahipurusa (primeval man from whose body the world was made). He came to embody both male and female elements of procreation, in either one of two modes of appearance. First, as Siva-Sakti, he appears only as a male support of the female power of fecundation. Second, as Ardhanarigvara, half male and half female, he symbolized both duality and unity of the generative act and the production of the universe for the union of two principles (Prikriti and Parusa, M.iyd and Braham). This coalescence of the male and female principles was further represented in his appearance in South India as Natarija, Lord of the Dance. He wears on his ears two earrings (Kutndalini), one of them an elongated female earring and the other a circular male earring. Here we have the merging of opposites in a single personage, self-subsistent and self-generative. The emblem under which he particularly delights to be worshipped in this androgynous manifestation is the litgam or phallus, which is always erect. The liitgam and the female sex organ (yoni) represent the totality of his nature and the totality of all created existence. The in part from his early association with the peacock (who is blue-necked) and the monsoon rains. Not only is Rudra the traditional lord of monsoons in the Vedic literature, but he is consistently seen by Kilid~isa in his lyric poem Meghadita as presiding over various storm phenomena. Furthermore, it may have been from his father Rudra-Siva that Kum~ra-Skanda received his association with the peacock as a vehicle. In any case, since Rudra traditionally made his power and presence most forcefully felt in the monsoons and since the peacock, which delights to prance about and cry at the first sign of rains, is considered to be the harbinger of the monsoons, then Siva may have obtained his blue throat by association with the peacock. (]I am indebted to Professor J. A. B. van Buitenen of the University of Chicago for this suggestion). 84) In the SvethAvatara, remarkable for its spirit of personal theism, Rudra is extolled as "the One... only, they do not allow a second, who rules the worlds by his powers." He is creator and destroyer of the cosmos, who is Tia, the Lord, hidden in all things and embracing all thing. "He who knows Him (Rudra) to be Brahman, becomes immortal".

So powerful an embodiment of the surging energies of life was this phallic aspect of Siva, that it was believed to have the capacity either to create or annihilate the cosmos, depending on how it was utilized. G. Parallels in the Structure of the Rituals If we grant that the devotees of a god usually imitate the actions of the god in some way, we may judge that a knowledge of the rituals dedicated to Siva and Dionysos may be gathered from a study of their characters. We should not therefore be surprised to discover many strange and 'aberrant' ritual activities dedicated to both gods, given their ferocious and ambivalent natures. From the literature of both traditions we learn that the cultic acts dedicated to them included singing, dancing, drumming, fluting, drinking wine and perhaps even ritual intercourse, cannibalism and human sacrifice. ss) Such rites were performed among the hill tribes in ancient Greece and were still performed by such tribes in India even into the last century, s6), s87) M. Eliade 8s) has shown decisively that orgiastic rites were performed by two $aivite subsects in ancient and medieval times in India. The Aghoris (lit. "not terrific") worship Siva as Smainavisin ("dweller in the crematoria") by imitating the actions of their Lord. They gird themselves with animal skins and a necklace of human skulls, smear their bodies with the ashes of the dead, dance wildly through the burning grounds shouting the syllable OM with thunderous voices (cf. Dionysos as Pp6EvIog below) and perform ritual cannibalism upon the corpses waiting to be cremated. Such revels were, no doubt held at night, as were those of Dionysos, for Siva is addressed as ni.a-carah ("Night-walker"). The sounds of their voices is compared with the roar of the drum, the clap of thunder and the bellow of the bull. The other subsect, called the Kipalikas ('"those of the skull") venerated Siva 85) R.

Both sects were much in evidence from the 6th century on as proved by references to them by the Chinese traveler Hiuen Tsiang (ca. A.D. 630-645). 89) In the lyric poem Meghadi~ta by IKlidasa, 9so) the cloud who is carrying word of encouragement from an exiled Yaksa (fertility daemon) to his forlorn mate at home, is asked to serve as "praise- worthy drum at the evening worship of Siva" (34). The poet says, "Thereby thou shalt attain perfect reward of thy deep rumbling thunder". The correlation between the Saivite and the Dionysiac cults is no more certain than at this point-noctural rites, the use of drums and dancing. Again the poet says, "When the dance begins, supply Siva's need for the bloody elephant's skin," (36) (referring to Siva's act of first killing the elephant demon which threatened to destroy the lives of his followers and then dancing in his skin while warm and wet) and "If thy thunder should rumble in glens as on a drum, Surely there thy music would be meet for the symphony of Siva." (56) That the ultimate goal of the Dionysiac mysteries was union with the god himself cannot be doubted. The Maenads (lit. 'mad women') who formed his 0Loaoq were often summoned suddenly and without warning by the haunting call of the god's voice, by mysterious sounds of flutes, drums and cymbals and by the light of flaming torches fled into the darkness of the woods to "dance the dance of god". The roar of Dionysos-at once, frightening and enticing-is likened to the sound of the drum, the roar of thunder and the bellow of the bull. His name Bromios l1) (from ppipxo 'to make a confused sound') makes him 'the God of a loud cry' (Pindar, frag. 45). In some texts he is con- nected with the thunder (Opov-4]) and in The Bacchae he is said to be 'thunder-born', 'a god of mysterious voices', and connected with strange orgiastic music which he brought with him from the Northern hills. 92) 89) Eliade quotes extensively from a I7th century Persian work by Muhein-i- Fani entitled Dabistan which provides graphic descriptions of such rites at that time.

Bruce Long The dancers used the 'bull-voiced mimes' in imitation of the voice of their lord. The female worshippers go clad in the usual attire (ax?us) of Dionysos. Over their regular cloaks, they fling the skin of a newly slain animal (usually a fawn or goat), loosen the locks of their hair, bind their heads with the headband of a serpent and carry in their hand any one of a number of instruments associated with the cultus-a slain fawn or tiger, the thyrsus-staff, a bowl of wine or a serpent. They take on the look of the wild things they have become. Dionysos is always surrounded by these maddened women who are his nurses and loved ones. They combine in themselves (as does their Lord), both the loftiest and the basest qualities of womankind. They are, on the one hand, nurses and mothers, sweethearts and consorts of the god. They nursed him when he was orphaned from Zeus, just as they gave suck from their breasts to the young animals of the forest. But the beastiality which lies in every woman is quickened in the Meanads as their minds are seized and carried away by the god. In this state of superhuman passion, they cavorted without restraint with the god in the woods, chasing down, tearing to pieces and eating raw the flesh of these same animals which they previously had nursed. This ogress-character of women is no more dramatically and pagnantly expressed than in The Bacchae where Agave, in the heat of drunken exaltation, slaughters and decapitates her own son, King Pentheus, all the while believing him to be a lion cub. These are other ways of becoming 'entheos' than by drinking wine. The other way of the Bacchae was the 'oreibasia' or mountain dancing described in the lacuna portion (between I I. 1129-30) of The Bacchae. This was a celebration performed by women's societies at Delphi which took place in mid-winter in alternate years. 93) In many societies the dance provides a religious experience which is not possible by any other means than by use of their bodies. The dance gave them the sense that they were possessed by an alien personality and that their own minds and bodies were nothing but a vehicle for the actions of that divine or daemonic spirit. The 'oreibasia' or mountain dancing described in The Bacchae depicts "hysteria subdued to the service of religion". One final thing that strikes us about the cults of Siva and Dionysos 93) Bacchae, 133.</page><page sequence="28">Siva and Dionysos 207 is their democratic attitude toward the admittance of devotees. These cults represent a departure from the customs of the established, hier- archical cults (Brahmanical and Olympian) of restricting membership to the social or religious elite. They were accessible to all who sought to serve them, not through intermediaries but directly and powerfully in the gifts of song and dance and through membership in the religious communiy. E. R. Dodds' 94) suggestion that Dionysos' cult may have appealed originally to those who were denied the right to full membership in the socio-religious community because of low birth and status and were hence excluded from the cults associated with the religious 'estab- lisment, may also be true of the cult of Siva. It is well known that such Saiva cults such as the Kipilikas, Aghoris and Lifigiyats gathered vast numbers of the 'disenfranchised' during the Indian middle ages (ca. 7th-9th centuries). An ode in praise of Dionysos in The Bacchae expresses beautifully the impartiality of both cults: The deity.., loves the goddess Peace, generous of good, preserver of the young. To rich and poor he gives the simple gift of wine, the gladness of the grape. But him who scoffs he hates, and him who mocks his life, the happiness of those for whom the day is blessed but doubly blessed the night; whose simple wisdom shuns the thoughts of proud, uncommon men and all their god- encroaching dreams. But what the common people do, the things that simple men believe, I too believe and do. [emphasis added] 95) There is evidence in Aristophanes' The Frogs 96) that his cult enjoyed widespread popularity in the Classical Age and for later periods we have inscriptional evidence that even slaves might be admitted to mem- bership in Dionysos' O0mooS. 97) In a word, Siva and Dionysos dispense their grace to all who were willing to receive it and to confess them as Lord. III. COINCIDENTIA OPPOSITORUM IN SIVA AND DIONYSOS What Siva and Dionysos mean to suffering mortality is the sudden and direct eruption of Divinity in the miracle of blessing and damnation. Both gods are ambivalent and unpredictable in their actions in the world and in their responses to devotees. Now they appear as benevolent 94) Dodds, Ibid., notes to lines 421I-23. 95) lines 416 ff. 96) lines 4o5 ff. 97) Cited in Dodds, Ibid., p. 121.</page><page sequence="29">208 J. Bruce Long liberators from bondage to the limitations of bodily existence and from finitude itself, then as terrifying daemons who, once they have possessed the soul of a person, threaten to destroy natural life itself. As we discovered earlier, what appears in the Vedic Rudra as a mere ambivalence of character, becomes in the Epic and Purinic Siva a coincidence of opposites. In the early period, Rudra's wrathfulness and impetuosity seems at times to overshadow his benevolence and gracious- ness. So irascible is he that even the prayers and offerings of his wor- shippers were thought to provoke his anger if not properly performed. He is at once god of disease and misfortune and the divine physician whose medicines heal all infirmities. He even presents a paternal aspect to his devotees as they bow before him "as a boy bows to his father as he blesses him". 98) Once this deity comes to be called Siva in the Epics, he retains this ambivalent and multifarious nature and expresses the contraries of raw impetuosity and unpredictable wrathfulness together with his boundless benevolence to a more radical degree. He both terrifies and fascinates. He is at once, a Divine Warrior and the Master of Yogins. He encorporates in his person the essence of male and female potency. He is both finite time as destroyer of all things and Eternity as the destroyer of time. As Hari-Hara, he is Creator and Destroyer, the embodiment of the duality and the unity of the entire cosmic process. Of Dionysos, one commentator says, "The mysterious Stranger is not simply an idealized being from outside man's world; he is Dionysos, the embodiment of those tragic contradictions-joy and horror, insight and madness, innocent gaiety and dark cruelty-which are implicit in all religions of the Dionysiac type. From the standpoint of human morality, he is and must be an ambiguous figure." 99) Plutarch, in his life of Antony, reminds us of this when he speaks of Antony's entrance into Ephesus as the new Dionysos who is acclaimed by many as if he were Dionysos, "the friendly god who lavishes blessings" (XIpLi6tY ' xoCd pLsLtX1Oo) even though he was for most "the bestial and wild one" (doi?a-r xa~t &amp;yptiLvVo). As Otto notes, even the animals who accom- pany him and in whose form he often becomes incarnate stand in sharp contrast to one another--the bull, goat and ass symbolizing "fertility and 98) RV II. 33.I2. 99) Dodds, Ibid., xiv.</page><page sequence="30">Siva and Dionysos 209 sexual desire", on the one side; the lion, panther and bull representing "the most bloodthirsty desire to kill", on the other, loo) His ambivalence is projected into the thyrsos which he and his worshippers carry; it produces milk and honey for the devotee and a sword for the enemy. As one scholar remarks, he is "the incarnate life- force itself". 101) As such he is not subject to the laws of morality but like Moira and the Fates, simply exists as inevitable and unalterable. When Cadmus complains that Dionysos' sentence of exile is too harsh, Dionysos replies, "I am god. I was blasphemed by you... Long ago my father ordained these things." 102) What exactly Siva and Dionysos were to their devotees by should be clear: they were the incarnation of elan vital itself, the uncontrollable, chaotic eruption of raw force from the bowels of nature, capable of creating or destroying, liberating or damning. As such, they are amoral or transmoral, free from conventional distinctions between good and evil, right and wrong. They are awe-inspiring embodiments of necessity itself (dharma in India, moira in Greece), capable of blessing those who worship them and of utterly destroying, physically or psychologically, those who deny them. "For divinity divested of morality becomes daemonic (not devilish but the reality of awful, inscrutable, careless power)," 103) The wisdom (prajfia in India, sophia in Greece) which comes from union with or worship of these divinities is such that the devotee experiences that coalescence of joy and sorrow, blessing and damnation, exaltation and terror which is the nature of life itself.
