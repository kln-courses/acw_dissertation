<plain_text><page sequence="1">Why Anthropomorphism in Children's Literature? Juliet Kellogg Markowsky Anthropomorphism is the ascribing of human attributes to non-human things. Much that is written is anthropomorphic, especially literature for children, but little is written about anthropomorphism and its practice. (Derby, 1970) While the broad definition of the word would include chil- dren's stories of talking machines and dolls, such as Little Toot and Raggedy Ann Sto- ries, I am concerned here only with the genre of talking animal stories. Animals have always had a place in liter- ature. Primitive story-tellers used animals as antagonists to dramatize mans ceaseless struggle against the forces of nature. ( Ma- gee, 1969) Animals were also used in didac- tic stories such as the fables of Aesop, and had roles in medieval literature as "questing beasts and dreamland dragons/' (Magee, 1969) The humanism of the Renaissance eclipsed interest in animals or animal stories. Not until Black Beauty was written by Anna Sewell did the genre of animal stories revive. William H. Magee suggests a con- nection between the revival and the emer- gence of Darwins theory of evolution. (1969) Presumably, people would have to accept their unity with nature before they could enjoy a tale with animals as the focus of attention. In post-Darwinian animal sto- ries, the animals could have needs and wishes of their own, but were not neces- sarily people in animal appearance or ani- mals conflicting with mans needs, such as those in stories written previous to the emergence of the theory. May Hill Arbuthnot categorizes animal stories three ways: stories that tell of ani- mals that dress and act like people, as The Wind in the Willows ; stories in which ani- mals talk, but act otherwise naturally, as Bambi ; and stories in which animals are objectively described, as in Marguerite Henry s horse stories.5 The former two categories, display an- thropomorphism, the first to a greater de- gree than the second, and the third does not. Ms. Burnford suggests that these cate- gories express a child's reading chrono- logically; earlier, s/he enjoys dressed ani- mal stories and then progresses to more realistic and more objective treatment.6 However, I can find nothing to prevent the same child from enjoying The Wind in the Willows and King of the Wind simulta- neously, and have observed it happen. Furthermore, adults enjoy Animal Farm , which uses animals anthropomorphized, for satirical reasons. What are the reasons that an author of children's books may dress animals or make them talk? The first reason is to enable young readers to identify with the animals. The animals in themselves- stripped of all human trappings of speech and clothing- may or may not be familiar to the child. The one thing that can unify what differ- ent children bring to a given book is that Juliet Markowsky is Children's Librarian at the Boston Public Library. 460</page><page sequence="2">Why Anthropomorphism in Children's Literature? 461 they may identify with an animal that has human attributes. Most children can iden- tify themselves with errant Peter in Beatrix Potter s The Tale of Peter Rabbit . The second reason is for the flight of fantasy itself. Animals that talk can let us in on another world which we may not be able to see without their help. We may see an occasional rabbit cross our path, but the talking rabbits on Rabbit Hill let us enter a world of woodland creatures with their own social structures and social be- havior that mimic and express our own. Many authors suggest that all humans, not only children, need to participate in an occasional flight into fantasy: "Inanimate objects can do what people are not able to, or cannot." (Derby, 1970) Perhaps this de- sire to escape is also related to a need for security: "We find a measure of escapism in the non-controversial constancy of animal behavior." (Burnford, 1962) Escapism must be looked at as not only escaping from a reality, but as escaping to a new form of reality which an imaginative author can provide. Thus escapism need not have nega- tive or limiting connotations. The third reason is for variety. An author can develop a great variety of characters in a short book with few words if an animal is used to express attributes commonly as- sumed to represent the creature. This is especially important in a picture book; a being can be lazy and slow-witted as a possum, simply by being a possum, with no elaborate description or character buildup necessary. An example is the goose who, "well, was a goose" in Johnny Crow's Gar- den . No more description is needed; the few simple words, the pictures, and the readers' mental image of being "silly as a goose" tell the whole story. If the young readers do not know the expression or have this mental image, but meet the ex- pression later, they will certainly know what it means if they remember the goose in Johnny Crow's Garden . The fourth reason is for humor. Animals who are caricatures of certain types of peo- ple are funny to adults and children alike. The humor is often based on the animal s picture and on what it says, not by its verbal description or a verbal account of its actions. Thus the humor in anthropomor- phism may be grasped by the youngest of readers of picture books, as much of the humor is not dependent on language. Toad, in The Wind in the Willows , is a good ex- ample of a humorously exaggerated per- sonality type. The discrepancy between his being a toad, often a symbol of ugliness in literature, and his being a fop and a dandy, also make him an inimitably funny creature. Following are some excellent anthropo- morphic animal fantasy stories. Johnny Crow's Garden is a picture book, a story without a plot. It is a description of some very entertaining animals' antics which took place in the fantasyland of Johnny Crow's garden. The concepts and humor are developed in Leslie Brooke's pic- tures, with the words suggesting events in simple rhyming couplets. The humor is in the anthropomorphizing, both verbal in the couplets, and visual in the pictures; the vain and silly lion, usually the King of Beasts, and the whale boring everybody with his "very long tale." Leslie Brooke's animals are mocking stereotyped people and the different kinds of animals lend variety and humor to the picture. Beatrix Potter's family of rabbits in The Tale of Peter Rabbit are sensitively done in delicate watercolors and in delicate, gentle humor and irony, which contrasts with Leslie Brooke's broad and exaggerated humor. The rabbits wear jackets and go to market but do not lose their naturalness as rabbits. They are timid and get chased by dogs and people; they lead rabbit-like lives in spite of their speech and clothing. "The secret of a good 'dressed animal' is</page><page sequence="3">462 Elementary English that, while it may conform to human ideas of behavior, it remains in essence the pig or mouse or rabbit which it really is."9 Bea- trix Potter could identify with the creatures who were her companions; hence this sensi- tive and realistic anthropomorphism, done without the excessive sentimentality of Rabbit Hill concerning the animals' rela- tionships with human beings. Peter Rabbit's relationship with Mr. McGregor is certainly more realistic and exciting, than little Geòrgie s relationship with the New Folk. Kenneth Grahame takes us on a flight into a fantasyland of woodland creatures in The Wind in the Willows. All the ani- mals, of which there is great variety, have individual and unique personalities. The reader can laugh at them or with them. "Mole and Badger and Toad are real both as animals and as persons."10 This is a fan- tasyland of woods and the river as well as a microcosm of human trials and tribula- tion. The anthropomorphism is well done as the animals behave consistently accord- ing to their personalities, which derive from Grahame's imagination and not necessarily from popular conceptions of the animal. A badger is not considered worldly and wise, nor a toad, foppish and stubborn- except in The Wind in the Willows. Grahame's an- thropomorphism consists of giving an ani- mal a unique personality instead of devel- oping one already assumed in that animal. It requires creativity of the highest order to successfully create a new fantasy world such as this. Another author of this high caliber, who uses talking animals to introduce the reader into a fantasy world, is E. B. White. In Charlotte's Web , the animals look and act (to outsiders) just as normal barnyard ani- mals should. They have a remarkable ability to communicate with one another, however, and the reader and Fern can participate in their world, which excludes the other humans in the story. Charlotte, the spider, possesses the ability to communicate with other humans however, by spinning mes- sages in her web. The buildup in barnyard details, such as manure piles and board fences and spider webs, sets the stage for a fantasy which ends in a rather adult irony: Wilbur gets all the credit from peo- ple for being "Terrific" and "Some pig" while the remarkable Charlotte dies an un- sung death (although she will never be forgotten by Wilbur of course). E. B. White builds his characters somewhat on animal stereotypes- the stuttering goose, the some- times proud, sometimes insecure pig, the sneaking, self-serving rat- but he uses these stereotypes as a point of departure for creating totally unique and unforgettable characters. These works show how four outstanding authors use different types of anthropomor- phism, and they stamp it individually with their own creativity. Anthropomorphism will probably always be with us as man- kind, increasingly dependent on technology, will find enjoyment in nature and will be creative in projecting his humanity onto it. Small children will probably continue to find delight in their pets, in wild creatures, and in animals in zoos, and also in the world of fantasy inhabited by talking animals.
