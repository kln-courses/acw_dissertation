Padda yy a As has been rightly claimed by Feustel in the Introduction, Kniegrotte is one of the richest and most important Magdalenian stations of Central Europe. This cave is situated near the village of Dobritz in the province of Thuringia, East Germany ( GDR ). It was discovered in 1930 by the amateur archaeologist Martin Richter, who was then working in the postal department, In his spare time Richter excavated this site for nine seasons (1930-38 ). and even published a few short reports on his work. Owing to ill-health he could not bring out a comprehensive publication till his death in 1967. The monograph under review, prepared by Feustel and his colleagues subsequent to Richter's death, fills up this gap. The book is divided into 13 chapters as follows: 1) geographical background (R. Feustel); geology of the area (K. Kerkmann); 3) history of exacavations (R. Feustel); 4) stratigraphy (R. Feustel); 5) analysis of soil samples ( E. Schmid ) ; 6 ) analysis of charcoal ( H. Jacob and R. Feustel); 7) molluscan fauna (D. Mania); 8) study of animal bones (R. Musil); 9 ) study of fossil molluscs ( E. Lazar ) ; 10 ) penological examination of rock samples (J. Malina); 11 ) study of the cultural material (R. Feustel); 12) socio-economic observations (R. Feustel and R. Musil); and 13) study of the human skeletal remains ( H. Bach). Those dealing with the animal remains and cultural material are not only the major but the most important of these chapters. The bulk of the excavated material was obtained from the open area in front of the cave; the cave itself yielded very little material. It is therefore concluded that the Magdalenians lived in tents in front of the cave. The excavation exposed 14 strata. The main cultural level ( 8th layer from top) varies from 50 to 115 cm. in thickness. It consists of reddish soil interspersed with stone slabs, fire-places, animal bones and cultural material. It is very probable that the stone slabs originally formed part of a flooring. Basing themselves on a rough calculation of the probable gross quantity of meat provided by the various animals, Feustel and Musil believe ( p. 201 ) that the site was inhabited by a band of 14 persons for a total duration of 48 months, i.e., during three winter months spread over 16 years. The cultural material comprises over 6700 pieces and can be classified into three major categories. First, thçre are a number of artefacts made</page><page sequence="2">182 K. PADDAYYA of bone and antler, such as awls, needles, points of various types, chisels and batons. All these types are commonplace finds on the Euopean Magdalenian sites. Wethen have cetain art objects made of bone, antler, teeth and ivory. Among them three or four pieces deserve special mention : a) a double-rowed fish-shaped harpoon of ivory bearing stroke-like incisions on the body; b) two anthropomorphic figurines of ivory; and c) an antler chisel bearing an inciscd female figure resembling the Venus figurine from Predmost. The most remarkable object, however, is a foot-shaped pendant of ivory with the body showing incised decoration. Its upper end has two perforations, while the lower end shows four tooth-like projections. Taking clue from a belief current in Germany in mediaeval times when women with long feet were considered to be very fertile, Feustel surmises that the figurine was used in fertility magic and perhaps also as an amulet in defence magic. The flint industry, accounting for over 95% of the cultural material, comprises 6162 specimens. Of these, only 1610 pieces are finished tools. The latter include various forms of knives, end-scrapers, burins, borers and blad elet s One frequent type in the industry is formed by triangles, which account for 9.5 % of the finished tools. This immediately reveals the Late Magdalenian ( Phase VI ) character of the site. After a detailed comparison of the asse- mblage with those from other Magdalenian sites in Central and Western Europe, Feustel concludes that the present industry represents a new variant- called the Kniegrotte variant characterised by the occurrence of triangles with one of the arms retouched to a concave shape and burins with long-drawn- out working ends - within a larger Central European Magdalenian group caHed the ölknitzer group. An interesting artefact type found at the Kniegrotte site is formed by what Feustel calls the 'zigzag' blades. Such blades, known as the crested ridge blades, are of common occurrence in the blade industry of the Neolithic-Chalcolithic cultures of the Indian sub-conti- nent. Feustel does not seem to be aware of the function of these artefacts, viz., to guide the 'run' of the first series of blades to bedeatchedfromthe fluted core (Subbarao 1955). In the chapter on animal remains Rudolf Musil provides a systematic and very valuable study of the material. That the occupants of this cave specialised in the hunting of the wild horse ( Equus germánicas ) is proved by the preponderance of the bones of this animal. Other an'mals represented in the assemblage are the reindeer ( probably regarded asa holy animal), Saiga antelope, arctic fox, red fox, red deer and brown bear. The presence of the bones of the ptarmigan, moor hen, goose and falcon reveals that fowling also played a part in the food-economy. An interesting aspect of the faunai material deserving notice here concerns the wolf.- From the relatively small size of the body and the shortened form of the facial bones it is cemchided that this animal was domesticated and used as an aid in horse- fronting. This is the earliest known evidence of the domestication of wolf</page><page sequence="3">DIE KNIEGRTTE EINE MAGDALENIEN STATION IN 1 83 from Central Europe. Musil's careful study of the cut-marks occurring on the bones enables us to reconstruct the butchering practices followed by the people. Coming to the question of dating, basing himself on the composition of the vertebrate fauna and its climatic implications Musil argues ( pp. 66-68 ) that the site belongs to the Older Drayas ( Dryas IT ) following upon the Bölling Oscillation. The molluscan fauna and the C-14 date of 10,230 + 90 B. P., however, suggest that the occupation extended into the Aller öd period. In conclusion, all persons interested in European prehistory will heartily welcome this useful publication. Feustel and his Collaborators deserveoLr congratulations for bringing it out. The inclusion of over 110 well-chosen illustrations greatly add to the value of this monograph. REFERENCE Subbarao, B. 1955.
