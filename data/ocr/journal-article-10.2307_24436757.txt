PETTIGREW I In Chapter IV of The Interpretation of Dreams, Freud raises a question concerning the two distinctly different psychic agencies producing the manifest and latent contents of the dream. He defers his discussion of these agencies, but takes time in passing to claim that psychology has waited in vain for philosophy to provide it with satisfactory conclusions regarding the structure of the mental apparatus.1 In an apparent response to this charge, over the past twenty years, philosophers have embraced a wide range of psychoanalytic problematics. We can cite two examples of this in passing, including Lacoue-Labarthe's and Nancy's Le Titre de la Lettre, which considers the relation between psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan and a number of philosophers including Hegel, Rousseau, and Heidegger,2 and Jacques Derrida's Freud and the Scene of Writing, which considers the relation of the metaphysics of presence, and Freud's notion of the death drive.3 However, one would be mistaken to think that the relation between psychoanalysis and philosophy is the result of a new trend precipitated by Freud's provocation. Throughout history, indeed, philosophy has engaged in the consideration of psychological issues. Descartes, for example, advanced a notion of thelcogito as a simple and indivisible substance - privileged as such from the divisible substance of its own body as well as that of the world.4 Nietzsche thematized the existence of 1 Sigmund Freud, The Interpretation of Dreams, trans, ed.

It can be suggested that Descartes borrowed the notion of a discrete indivisible substance as the underlying explanation of what is from Aristotle's notion of substance. However, while for Aristotle the notion substance applied to humans, plants, animals, and the prime mover, Descartes, on the other hand, privileges the substance of the cogito in a triad of substances: cogito, the body that is attached to the cogito, and extended bodies and or space outside of the cogito. 67</page><page sequence="2">68 DAVID E. PETTIGREW two psychological tendencies, as well as the determination of conscious thought by a deeply buried and forgotten unconsciousness,5 and John Dewey, contributed to our view of the experiential constitution of the mind or consciousness, declaring that communication, as the proleptic interpretation of events with respect to consequences, is the condition of consciousness.6 Yet in addition to these three relatively modern examples, we could just as well go back to Plato's Republic to find a link between philosophy and psychology in Socrates' attempt to identify and make an analogy between the virtues in the ideal state and the virtues in the individual 5 Friedrich Nietzsche, "Truth and Lies in a Non-Moral Sense" in Philosophy and Truth: Selections From Nietzsche's Notebooks of the Early 1870's, trans, and ed. with an introduction by Daniel Breazeale (New Jersey: Humanities Press, 1979), p. 86. In this early essay Nietszche proposed that our perception of the world leads to an irresolvable rift between two psychological tendencies: the artistic on the one hand and the scientific rational on the other. Moreover, he suggested that we perceive the world metaphorically. The first metaphor occurs when a nerve stimulus is transferred into an image, and the second when the image is imitated in a sound. Here metaphor is understood as a transfer from stimulus to image and then from image to sound or language. The metaphor is thematized as an abstraction or alienation from an apparent origin. The language resulting from these metaphorical sounds is further abstracted in the way that each word or concept is meant to be "fit for countless more or less similar cases" and is "not supposed to serve as a reminder of the unique and entirely individual original experience to which it owns its origin", p. 83. Such a language of abstractions, what for Locke was the quite practical matter of nominal essence, is for Nietzsche a system of lies separating us from nature itself. For Nietzsche it is our nature as artistically creating subjects to produce or be the production of metaphors. The creation of metaphors is, he asserts the fundamental human drive. This drive manifests itself in two ways. If we are rational we take refuge in the way our metaphors protect us from the changes in and dangers of nature. If we are intuitive or artistic we revel in the spontaneity of metaphor as it breeds yet other unrelated and causally inexplicable metaphors. The rational tendency clings to the "truth" of its anthropomorphic metaphors by forgetting them as such. Forgotten metaphors become the means by which we perceive our world, operating: . . unconsciously and in accordance with habits which are centuries old: precisely by means of this unconsciousness and forgetfullness he arrives at his sense of truth." p. 84. 6 John Dewey, Experience and Nature, (New York: Dover, 1958), p. 212. In the essay "Nature Mind and Subject", Dewey contrasted what he considered to be the ancient Greek view and the modern view of the individual. The ancient view found the individual to be wholly constituted by social norms, customs and beliefs. The emphasis was not on the individual but rather on the themes that constituted the individual. On this account the individual was seen as something to be controlled or suppressed. The modern view on the contrary considers the individual to be solipsistic and transcendent with respect to nature. Dewey considered the practical consequences of each view and proposed a novel reconstruction of the individual. He saw that the individual is indeed constituted to some extent by the customs and beliefs of his or her time, yet also has a constitutive role in a kind of mediated dialogue with its environment. Dewey's way of reading the self as constituted, in part, by its environment is not unlike Freud's theory that the psyche is formed by its emotional identifications with its parents, as well as religious, cultural and social influences and events.</page><page sequence="3">RELATION OF PHILOSOPHY AND PSYCHOANALYSIS 69 soul, as he seeks to locate justice in the individual soul.7 With respect to the ideal state Socrates identifies the virtues of wisdom, courage, temperance and justice. The rulers of the state possess wisdom to the extent that they know what is best for the state. The guardians possess courage to the extent that they are prepared to defend or expand the state as necessary. The craftspersons, guardians, rulers, and other citizens are temperate to the extent that they perform the duties for which they are best suited. The proper relation of courage, wisdom, and temperance produces justice. However, when Socrates identifies the virtues in the individual soul, they appear to be quite different from those in the state. He finds three functions or elements described as inhibiting, spirited, and appetitive. Given the difference between the elements in the state and the soul, how does he establish the analogy that he seeks? The analogy is accomplished on the basis of the controlling function that he finds in the ideal state as well as in the soul. In the state, the rulers and guardians control the craftspersons and other classes. In the case of the individual soul the inhibiting function and the spirited element are in league to subdue the appetitive drives. One could speculate that with this analogy that which has come to be known as the Freudian notion of repression already seems to be in place. There are other examples of Freud's link to Plato that require little, or no speculation. In the Theatetus, Socrates considers the psyche as a wax tablet - a metaphor Freud himself employs in the 1925 Note on a Mystic Writing Pad.8 In the Symposium, Aristophanes gives a well-known account of human love or desire by referring to a myth in which an originary human form has been split by the Gods. The resulting beings could only find happiness through the reformation or unification of the two halves, thus healing their severed nature.9 This drive to an originary unity is analogous to the way the Freudian psyche seeks to regain an unconscious! state of quietude. In The Interpretation of Dreams Freud indicates that the basic wish is not a wish for a particular object, but a move to reduce the psychic tension resulting from a certain desire trauma or unpleasure. It is an apparatus he writes: . . . whose activities are regulated by an effort to avoid an accumulation of excitation and to maintain itself so far as possible without excitation. ... A current of this kind in the apparatus starting from unpleasure and aiming at pleasure, we have termed a 'wish' . . .10 One could, then, make the case that the current concentration on the 7 Plato, Republic, trans.

PETTIGREW link between psychology, or psychoanalysis and philosophy is not a new movement in the sense that the link has never been considered. What is in the air seems instead to be recalling a relationship which has always been the case and which has perhaps been unnecessarily strained with the advent of a more specialized discipline spawned by Freudian psychoanalysis. Yet if one insists on the difference between the disciplines of philosophy and psychoanalysis, there seems to be at least one possibility of drawing this difference decisively on the basis of a three-fold distinction between Kant and Freud. First, we will see that Freud investigates the unconscious, while Kant considers the possibility of the thinking subject. Second, Freud's unconscious is a place of desires and memories while the foundation underlying Kant's thinking subject is without contents. Third, Freud's project thematized the divisions and fragments of the psyche while Kant's required the transcendental unity of experience. A treatment of these differences should help locate philosophy and psychoanalysis in their proper spheres. II First, beginning with Kant it can be said briefly that his text, The Critique of Pure Reason, seeks the foundations of theoretical knowledge, or the way we know the world. In this sense his project is, as we know, epistemic. Rejecting experience as the foundation of our knowledge he investigates our knowledge as pure a priori, or absolutely free of experience. Experience, he explains, gives us information about what occurs now or has occurred previously, but it cannot tell us what the case will be absolutely.11 As free of the contingencies of experience the a priori seems a more viable candidate for the transcendental grounding of our knowledge as universal and necessary. Of course the text is also a critique and rejection of metaphysical dogma related to God, the universe, and the nature of the soul, but for the moment we are concerned with seeing how an epistemic project becomes a theory or an account of the subject. In the first Critique Kant investigates what must be the case in order for a thinking subject to perceive the objects of its experience. First, he describes the forms of intuition, namely space and time, which must be the case a priori if we are to give form to the objects of our experience. He writes, for example, that "space is necessary a priori representation which underlies all outer intuitions", for, "we can never represent to ourselves the absence of space, though we can quite well think it as 11 Immanue) Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, trans, and ed. Norman Kemp Smith (St. Martins Press, 1965), p. 43.. (Cited here as CPR).</page><page sequence="5">RELATION OF PHILOSOPHY AND PSYCHOANALYSIS 71 empty of objects".12 The a priori form of time is, however, a form which enables us to give form to space itself. He writes: Time is a necessary representation that underlies all intuitions. We cannot in respect of appearances in general remove time itself, though we can quite well think time as void of appearances. Time is therefore given a priori. In it alone is the actuality of appearances possible at all. Appearances may one and all vanish; but time (as the universal condition of their possibility cannot itself be removed.)13 Time is not just another form which makes the appearance of objects possible but is, Kant states, the form of the inner sense, "that is, of the intuition of ourselves and our inner state. . . ,"14 With this treatment of the possibility of our perception of ourselves, that we can see that Kant's project investigates the conditions of the possibility of the self as such. In addition to the question of a subject that gives form to the objects of its perception with the forms of space and time, Kant's deduction considers what must be the case in order that the subject gives thought to the object of its perception: that is, insofar as the subject is, or can be, a thinking subject. This domain, that of the understanding, that "complicated web of human knowledge", provides the possibility, or more properly, the rules of giving thought to the object. These rules take the form of the categories under the headings of: Quantity, Quality, Relation, and Modality. Moreover, in addition to the exposition of the intuition and the deduction of the understanding, Kant deduces a "supreme principle of the understanding" which is the condition of the possibility of the synthesis or combination of the forms of intuition and the rules of the understanding in the same consciousness.17 Such a synthesis is necessary in order to say that all of my thoughts are my thoughts and thus that there is a thinking subject. Kant writes: Only in so far therefore as I can unite a manifold or given representation in one consciousness is it possible to represent to myself the identity of one consciousness in these representations.18 Thus we see that Kant's treatment of our way of knowing the world brings with it the a priori form of the subject as the condition of the possibility of that knowing. But what form does this transcendental subject take? With respect to our knowledge of this subject we need to take account of a distinction between the phenomenal and the noumenal object that is fundamental to Kant's project. The phenomenal is the object of our 12 Ibid., p. 68. 13 Ibid., p. 75. 14 Ibid., p. 77. 15 Ibid., p. 147. 16 Ibid., p. 147. 17 Kant, CPR, p. 155. 18 Ibid., p. 153.</page><page sequence="6">72 DAVID E. PETTIGREW experience as we have given it its form by virtue of the forms of space and time and the categories of the understanding. The noumenal is the idea of the object in itself which remains unknown to us. Our knowledge of the object is limited to the way we are able to give form and thought to it. Kant writes: Since no representation, save when it is an intuition is in immediate relation to an object, no concept is ever related to an object immediately, but to some other representation of it, be that representation an intuition or itself a concept. Judgement is therefore the mediate knowledge of an object, that is, the representation of a representation of it.19 19 Ibid., p. 105. Here we note that the noumenal, or that which is assumed to underlie the phenomenal, has a paradoxically negative status. While it is a kind of foundation - as the idea of the thing in itself - we have no knowledge of or access to it. On page 270 Kant writes: "Doubtless indeed there are intelligible entities corresponding to the sensible entities; there may also be intelligible entities to which our sensible faculty of intuition has no relation whatsoever; but our concepts of understanding, being mere forms of thought for our sensible intuition could not in the least apply to them. That therefore which we entitle 'noumenon' must be understood as being such only in a negative sense." However, we will note later in our paper that the status of the noumenal seems to undergo a change later in the first Critique as well as in Kant's practical texts. To say that the phenomenal/noumenal distinction is fundamental to Kant's work, or to take account of its status in the theoretical as opposed to the practical corpus, does not give sufficient thought to the questions raised by his use of the terms: phenomenal, noumenal, transcendental object and thing-in-itself. Kant writes at A 253, for example, "The object to which I relate appearance in general is the transcendental object, that is the completely indeterminate thought of something in general. This cannot be entitled noumenon; for I know nothing of what it is in itself, and have no concept of it save as merely the object of sensible intuition in general." At A 250-1, Kant writes: "All our representations are, it is true, referred by the understanding to some object; and since appearances are nothing but representations, the understanding refers to them as something, as the object of sensible intuition. But this something thus conceived, is only the transcendental object; and by that is meant a something = X, of which we know, and with the present constitution of our understanding can know, nothing whatsoever, but which, as a correlate of the unity of apperception, can serve only for the unity of the manifold in sensible intuition. By means of this unity the understanding combines the manifold into the concept of an object. This transcendental object cannot be separated from the sensible data, for nothing is then left through which it might be thought." These passages suggest that the transcendental object, and the noumenon, refer to the same thing-in-itself. (See, for example Henry E. Allison, Kant's Transcendental Idealism: An Interpretation and Defense, (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1973), p.242) Yet, in a sense which seems quite odd in the light of the B deduction, the transcendental object, of which we have "no concept," is differentiated from the noumenon. Allison, at page 245, suggests that this bifurcation depends on Kant's use of the term noumenon in his "rich sense". Moreover, while the transcendental object and noumenon refer to the thing in itself, the passages cited here suggest a thematic link between the transcendental object and "the sensible intuition in general", "the unity of the manifold in sensible intuition"," and "sensible data"; suggesting that they refer to the thing-in-itself in different ways. In the B deduction these distinctions fade from the picture and the emphasis is on the noumenal to the exclusion of the transcendental object. Here at A 255/B310, he emphasizes the problematical and limiting aspect of the concept of noumena, "the function of which is to curb the pretensions of sensibility".In other words, as we have already seen</page><page sequence="7">RELATION OF PHILOSOPHY AND PSYCHOANALYSIS 73 For Kant, our knowledge of the self is also limited by this epistemo logical distinction. This distinction that defines the rules of engagement of a subject's perception of the world also produces what we might refer to as a blind spot in the subject itself. The subject is able to know itself only as it appears to itself and not as it is in itself. In the Transcendental Aesthetic he says that we only know our mode of perceiving objects and not the things in themselves and that this holds true of the inner sense, for the mind can only know itself in the way that it is effected by its activity.20 Kant raises the question of the subject more directly in the B deduction when he says that it would be a good place for "explaining the paradox which must have been obvious to everyone in the exposition of the form of the inner sense: namely that this sense represents to consciousness even our own selves only as we appear to ourselves and not as we are in ourselves."21 In other words, that which is the the noumenon is no longer to be taken in its so-called "rich" sense, but now is only negative. In his commentary Kemp Smith writes at page 409, that "This confusion between the concept of a noumenon and the less definite concept of object in general, ... is probably due to the combining of manuscripts at different dates . . ." At pge 412 Kemp Smith indicates that in the second edition, certain paragraphs are omitted and "those paragraphs in which the doctrine of the transcendental object finds expression are entirely eliminated and the phrase "transcendental object is no longer employed". For Kemp Smith these changes suggest the development and clarification of Kant's thinking. One could speculate that the disappearance of the transcendental object, at least nominally, is due to centrality of the idea of freedom for Kant's project. To the extent that the transcendental object as thing in itself is linked, at least thematically as we have seen, to the "sensible"; Kant's insistence on the necessity of freedom from the sensible would be more problematical. Kant asserts after all that the "inevitable consequence of obstinately insisting on the reality of appearances is to destroy all freedom" (A537/B 565). Kemp Smith suggests that an "adequate judgement" of Kant's distinction between the appearance and the reality must take account of the Paralogism the Third and Fourth Antinomies, and the Appendix to the Dialectic. (See footnote 21) 20 Ibid., p. 82. 21 Ibid., p. 166. This talk of a split in the self is not a Kantian "slip". It is a theme which undergoes subsequent treatment in the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, trans. H. J. Paton (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1948) and The Critique of Practical Reason, trans. Lewis White Beck (Indianapolis: Bobbs Merrill, 1956). (Cited here as CPrR). In the Groundwork Kant continues the notion of a noumenal and phenomenal distinction, but there is a more than subtle shift in the status of the noumenal. Kant states on p. 119: . . it follows of itself that behind appearances we must admit and assume something else which is not appearance - namely, things in themselves - although since we can never be acquainted with these but only with the way in which they affect us, we must resign ourselves to the fact that we can never get any nearer to them and can never know what they are in themselves. This must yield us a distinction, however rough, between the sensible world and the intelligible world, the first which can vary a great deal according to differences of sensibility in sundry observers, while the second, which is its ground, always remains the same." Thus we see what was in The Critique of Pure Reason only considered in a negative sense, is now the permanent and abiding ground of appearances. What was previously held to be the paradoxical manner in which the self itself was subsumed by the phenomenal/noumenal distinction, is now articulated as foundation. In the Groundwork</page><page sequence="8">74 DAVID E. PETTIGREW possibility of the self is, as a priori, inaccessible or unknown to the self. Even with our schematic treatment here, we can see in the very early pages of The Critique of Pure Reason, that Kant thematizes, along with the condition of the possibility of knowledge, the condition of the possibility of the thinking subject. Turning to Freud now, however, we have said that his treatment of the unconscious is not a theory of the subject. As the name implies, the M/z-conscious is not accessible to consciousness or the thinking subject. But what is this realm which Freud differentiates from consciousness? It is not a side-kick of consciousness. It is a realm with its own integrity and rules of operation. It cannot be considered as that which is simply not present to consciousness but rather it determines and gives form to conscious thought. In The Interpretation of Dreams Freud writes: It is essential to abandon the overvaluation of the property of being conscious . . . the unconscious must be assumed to be the general basis of psychic life. The unconscious is the larger sphere, which includes within it the smaller sphere of the conscious. Everything conscious has an unconscious preliminary phase; whereas what is unconscious may remain at that stage and nevertheless claim to be regarded as having the value of a psychical process. The unconscious is the true psychical reality.22 This unconscious contains certain latent ideas which later become conscious but here we see even more fundamentally, that it also dynamically contains itself.23 In Civilization and Its Discontents Freud's work suggests an account of the genesis of the unconscious in which the unconscious is constituted by a drive seeking a state of undifferentiated quietude. This drive, which manifests itself in early infancy, seeks this foundation is also the foundation of the self as the self is thematized as belonging to the intelligible, noumenal realm. Here in spite of the new status the ground of the self the noumenal continues to be inaccessible. At 119 he writes: "Yet beyond the character of himself as a subject made up, as it is, or mere appearances he must suppose there to be something else which is its ground - namely his Ego as this may be constituted in itself; ... as regards whatever there may be in him of pure activity he must count himself as belonging to the intellectual world of which, however, he knows nothing further." In The Critique of Practical Reason Kant asserts on page 6 that "the strange but incontrovertible assertion of the speculative critique that the thinking subject is only an appearance to itself in inner intuition now finds its full confirmation". For it is in the CPrR that the noumenal self leads to the possibility of a series of practical postulates with inseparable correlates including the immortality of the soul, moral freedom, and the existence of God. 22 Freud, Dreams, p. 651. In the 1912 paper, "A Note on the Unconscious in Psychoanalysis" in General Psychological Theory, New York: Collier Books, 1963), p. 53, Freud writes: "Unconsciousness is a regular and inevitable phase in the processes constituting our mental activity; every mental act begins as an unconscious one, and it may remain so or go on developing into consciousness, according as it meets with resistance or not." 23 Sigmund Freud, "A Note on the Unconscious in Psychoanalysis" in General Psychological Theory, (New York Collier Books, 1963) p. 52).</page><page sequence="9">RELATION OF PHILOSOPHY AND PSYCHOANALYSIS 75 escape from the threats of the empirical world and from itself as conscious, making itself inaccessible to consciousness.24 In this process, the inaccessible unconscious produces consciousness as a by-product or symptom of this more originary drive or desire for unity. As a result of this tendency, which we might call implosive, Freud asserts that: In its innermost nature the unconscious is as much unknown to us as the reality of the external world and it is as incompletely presented by the data of consciousness as is the external world by the communications of our sense organs.25 How then are we to know the unconscious? Here it is Freud who invokes Kant's name in his description of the way the unconscious is to be approached. Just as Kant warned us not to overlook the fact that our perception is subject ively determined and must not be regarded as identical with the phenomena perceived but never really discerned, so psychoanalysis bids us not to set conscious perception in the place of the unconscious mental process which is its object. The mental like the physical is not necessarily what it appears to be.26 The unconscious must be read, then, as an appearance. For Freud, it is well known moreover that the dream offered the "royal road" to the unconscious. While other dream theories concentrated on the manifest content or the appearance of the dream, he considered his the first to consider the latent content, writing that, . . . "the dream thoughts and dream content are presented to us like two versions of the same subject 24 Sigmund Freud, Civilization and Its Discontents trans. James Strachey, (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1961), pp. 12-16. Freud suggests that at birth and for some undetermined time the infant feels completely connected with its world. He refers to this state as an "oceanic feeling" - in which the infant is in a fluid connection to its environment. In the oceanic state the infant has not yet differentiated itself from its environment and feels a bond with the external world. In this state all infant needs are met. Yet in time, the infant finds that its needs are not met in a sufficiently timely manner. Thus it begins to separate itself from the world. It learns that there is an external world of pain and trauma and it separates itself from the world to form, as Freud writes on p. 14, a "pure pleasure ego confronted by a strange and threatening outside". Freud continues on p. 15, "In this way the ego detaches itself from the external world. Or, to put it more correctly, originally the ego includes everything, later it separates off an external world from itself. Our present ego-feeling is therefore, only a shrunken residue of a much more inclusive- indeed all embracing feeling . . Then, in spite of its flight from the world the ego discovers it is unable to satisfy its need for quiescence. Thus it divides again, repressing its external contact with the world. It is not the ego which produces the unconscious but rather the drive to unity or quiescence. 25 Freud, Dreams, p. 651. 26 Sigmund Freud, "The Unconscious," trans. Cecil M. Baines in General Psycho logical Theory, p. 121.</page><page sequence="10">76 DAVID E. PETTIGREW matter in two different languages."27 Freud's dogmatic assertion in the The Interpretation of Dreams that the dream is the active fulfillment of a wish, was in stark contrast, of course, with his observation that the manifest content of the dream was distorted and unpleasurable. This contrast led him to thematize an agency of censorship or repression producing the very distinction between the manifest and the latent contents. In the same way that the drive to quiescence contained unconsciousness, repressing the intrusion of consciousness, here in the dream work, the agency of repression prevents the latent dream thoughts from entering consciousness. Their admission to consciousness would be unpleasurable, upsetting the aim of the basic wish for quiescence. Thus the manifest content of the dream, is a distorted remnant or appearance of the latent thoughts. It is not surprising that as we regard the unconscious only as appearance, repression is similarly deduced, Freud asserts, not in itself but only from its final results.29 The analyst, says Freud, must proceed largely by inference.30 In the light of this reflection then, we begin to see that while Kant treats of the thinking subject, Freud's project emphasizes the unconscious and its distorted appearance. Our attempt to draw a simple distinction between the two projects, however, seems problematical. Although Freud's unconscious is not a thinking subject, he asserts that every thought begins in the unconscious. We see, moreover, a similar motif in each thinker between that which is in-itself and that which is merely an appearance.31 Perhaps moving to our second point of distinction will prove more useful, namely that the foundation of the Kantian subject is without contents while Freud's unconscious is a cauldron whose cathected objects, he writes, "ramify like a fungus, so to speak, in the dark, and take on extreme forms of expression".32 Ill Kant's project, as we have already seen, looks away from the empirical. The a priori is by definition prior to and free of empirical contents. He writes: 27 Freud, Dreams, p. 312. 28 Ibid., p. 177. 29 Sigmund Freud, "Repression," in General Psychological Theory, p. 111. 30 Freud, Dreams, p. 651. 31 Freud's deduction of the unconscious is a scientific hypothesis based on empirical evidence and Kant's deduction of the pure form of time is transcendental. Freud however, speaks in "On Narcissism" on page 59 in the metapsychological papers of the necessity of speculating quite apart from the empirical evidence. He takes account of the inadequacy of the empirical evidence and seems to call for another kind of thinking, "abandoning observation for barren theoretical discussions", theoretical discussion which are nonethe less the "coping-stone" of the whole structure. 32 Freud, "Repression", p. 107.</page><page sequence="11">RELATION OF PHILOSOPHY AND PSYCHOANALYSIS 77 ... in what follows therefore we shall understand by a priori not knowledge independent of this experience or that experience but knowledge independ ent of all experience . . . a priori with no admixture of anything empirical.33 Indeed, Kant states that the a priori form of time, is "not something which exists in itself, inheres in things or remains when abstraction is made of all subjective conditions of its intuition."34 If it is this content free a priori time, as Kant has stated, that is the form of the inner sense then it can be seen clearly that his project is not an empirical psychology. He asserts that in contrast to his project, psychology is that which deals in the pathological or the study of feeling.3 This is indeed a motif which persists in Kant's work. In the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals Kant speaks of the necessity of scrupulously cleansing the metaphysics of morals of everything empirical.36 In the same text Kant's deduction of a supreme moral principle requires that the human subject be a member of an intelligible or intellectual world which is not bound to the sensible world of the laws of nature37 As a rational being, and consequently as belonging to the intelligible world, man can never conceive the causality of his own will except under the idea of freedom; for to be independent of determination by causes in the sensible world (and this is what reason must always attribute to itself) is to be free. To the idea of freedom there is inseparably attached the concept of autonomy and to this in turn the universal principle of morality - a principle which in Idea forms the ground for all the actions of rational beings, just as the laws of nature does for all appearances.38 The moral subject then is, of necessity, free of the laws of the sensible empirical world. Without engaging in Kant's practical corpus problem atically or in detail at this stage of the paper, we can see that the emptying of all empirical contents from the human subject is central to his project. Freud's unconscious, on the other hand, far from being empty, is constituted by fragments of complex and memory laden psychical identifications, internalizations, and traumas. Psychic identification with an object is most often the result of the loss of the object. In this process, the psyche identifies strongly with that which has been lost. The lost object is internalized or psychically ingested so that it can be kept in 33 Kant, CPR, p. 43. 34 Kant, CPR, p. 76. 35 Immanuel Kant, Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, trans. H. J.

The internalization of the object is not a one time event of convenience for the object. The emotional past it represents plays an active, if hidden, role in the psyche. It can, for example, become an ideal object which is set up alongside the ego, "remoulding" and "casting a shadow in the ego". In this process the ego can be split and divided against itself.40 Perhaps the most significant and well-known form of identification is that of the child with its parents - an identification which in the case of men, is related to the Oedipus complex and the subsequent emergence of the super-ego: one part of the tri-partite division of the psyche (ego, id, and super- ego) which Freud advances in the 1923 The Ego and the Id. As an infant, the child identifies with each of its parents. The male child, for example, identifies with his father in a primary way as an ego ideal and at the same time has an attachment to his mother. The two identifications exist side by side until the general tendency of the mental apparatus toward unification brings them together. As a result of this conflation the child recognizes that the father stands in the way of the mother. As the child attempts to overcome the father, he - the father - is vanquished, internalized, and set up in the psyche as the super-ego. The super-ego contains all the ambiguity of the son's relationship with the father. The ambiguity includes love, hate, and fear, and the super ego is "the representative of every moral restriction and the advocate of striving toward perfection".41 When the father is internalized he is in one sense overcome or defeated, but in the more important sense, as internalized, or psychically ingested, he becomes inescapable. We see then, that while Kant's account of the possibility of the subject insists that its foundations be free of empirical contents, Freud's unconscious is constituted by the fragments of its identifications. If we dwell on the fragmented constitution of the unconscious we are led to our third distinction between these two thinkers. For it is Kant who aims at an absolute unification of the subject and the grounding of its knowledge, while Freud's unconscious calls for a seemingly exponential display of divisions and fragments. 39 Sigmund Freud, Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego (1921), trans. James Strachey (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1959), p. 40-41. 40 In "Morning and Melancholia" in General Psychological Theory, Freud shows that extreme melancholy may result as the lost loved one takes the place of or exists along side the ego. The ego mourns the loss but confuses the lost object with itself. In the resulting confusion the ego maligns itself for its demise. In an extreme form this identification is narcissistic, in the sense that the internalization of the love object is related to a more fundamental love of self. In the case of an ego's identification with more than one person, the result might be a split personality. As discussed in Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego, identification might be instutionalized as groups identify with one person in the form of a religious leader or General. 41 Sigmund Freud, "Dissection of the Personality" in New Introductory Lectures (1933) trans.

Yet in and of themselves neither the a priori forms of time and space or the categories of the understanding unify experience absolutely. They are lacking in that they need an object to be given in experience. By definition, as a priori, space and time are, in and of themselves, nothing that is or that can be experienced empirically. While they are the condition of the possibility of experience they themselves are condi tioned by the need for the object to be given in experience. Given its incompletion, Kant shows that it is the nature of reason to search for the absolute unity which it lacks in experience, seeking an unconditioned and transcendent state. Such a unity can only be found beyond experience where, as such, there is no possibility of any object being given, and thus no need for any object to be given. Kant treats of this tendency of reason to seek absolute unity beyond experience as the ideas of pure reason. As reason attempts to unify all of its experience it posits absolute positions with respect to god, the universe, and the self, or theology, cosmology, and psychology. The resulting positions are diametrically opposed, or antinomial, as reason comes into conflict with itself. For example, in relation to cosmology, the antinomy of freedom posits that either there is absolutely no freedom because all events have been determined mechanistically according to the laws of nature, or that insofar as there is no causality, then there must be absolute freedom. But how does reason's drive to an unconditioned overcome its phenomenal limitations on the one hand, and the deadlock of the antinomial positions on the other? Kant shows that reason must resolve this antinomy in the context of the phenomenal/noumenal distinction which is central to his work. If we say that our knowledge is phenomenal then we presuppose that there is something - namely the noumenal - underlying the appearance.42 As phenomenal, things are subject to the laws of nature, but as noumenal, that which underlies the phenomenal, as well as the transcendental subject, is part of an intelligible or noumenal realm. Kant writes: For since they (the phenomenal) are not things in themselves they must rest upon a transcendental object which determines them as representations; and consequently there is nothing to prevent us from ascribing to this trans cendental object, besides a quality in terms of which it appears, a causality which is not appearance although its effect is to be met with appearance. For Kant reason must assert the necessity of a realm free of the laws of 42 Kant, CPR, pp. 439, 466. 43 Ibid., p. 468.</page><page sequence="14">80 DAVID E. PETTIGREW phenomenal nature if there is to be anything like the possibility of a practical or ethical freedom.44 In this case however, reason does not give a prescription for what freedom must be like. It rather thematizes what must be the case absolutely if there is to be any freedom for itself. For while reason may posit the freedom of the will and other ideas, it does not extend our knowledge with respect to these ideas.45 The ideas of pure reason are problematical by their very nature and Kant goes so far as to refer to them as an illusion. He asserts, however, that these ideas are not just ideas but play an indispensably regulative role for the use of our reason. He writes: The absolute whole of appearances we might say - is only an idea since we can never represent it in an image, it remains a problem to which there is no solution. But since, on the other hand in the practical employment of the understanding our sole concern is with the carrying out of rules, the idea of practical reason can always be given in concreto, although only in part; it is indeed the indispensable condition of the practical employment of all reason. The practical idea is always in the highest degree fruitful, and its relation to our actual activities is indispensably necessary. Reason is here indeed exercising causality, as actually bringing about that which its concepts contains and of such wisdom we cannot say disparagingly it is only an idea.46 Reason's drive to absolute unity must also face the problem of the transcendental ego or a priori subject, which, as we have seen, is similarly subject to the limitations of time and space and the categories a priori. While it is the condition of the possibility of giving thought to the object it is conditioned by the need to have the object given in experience. And we have already seen that the self only knows itself as it appears to itself and not as it is in itself. Kant treats of reason's drive to the unconditioned with respect to the self in a series of paralogisms or faulty syllogisms - which he describes as being logical mistakes of which the thinker is unaware. In this case reason posits the subject itself as absolute substance, absolute simplicity, and as the absolute subject of all its thoughts. He writes: This is the concept, or, if the term be preferred, the judgement "I think". . . . this is the vehicle of all concepts, and therefore also of transcendental concepts and so is always included in the conceiving of the latter, and is itself transcendental. But it can have no special designation, but only serves to introduce all our thought as belonging to consciousness.47 As in the case of the other ideas of pure reason, Kant asserts that these presumptions of absolute substance and simplicity with respect to the soul are not to be found in experience. And as in the case of the antinomies, the paralogisms do not give us any knowledge of the subject 44 Ibid., p. 468. 46 Ibid., p. 319. 45 Ibid., pp. 630-631. 47 Ibid., p. 329.</page><page sequence="15">RELATION OF PHILOSOPHY AND PSYCHOANALYSIS 81 but only tell us what it must be like if it is to be grounded absolutely. Kant emphasizes that beyond the assumption that consciousness is the source of its representations, we can have no actual knowledge of the "I" of consciousness.48 It appears, however, that Kant's attempt to unify knowledge on the transcendental a priori, and reason's attempt to ground itself absolutely on the transcendent, produces a series of paradoxical divisions or splits. One such split appears between the phenomenal and the noumenal. Another split or fragmentation appears in the first Critique, as Kant treats of the Aesthetic, the Analytic, the paralogisms and the antinomies, finding different functions and capacities of reason. Further, reason's "resolution" of the antinomies leads to a schism with the positing of a noumenal or intelligible realm over against the phenomenal or sensible. But it was Freud's project that we had characterized as that which splits or divides, and it was on the basis of this tendency that we had planned to differentiate Kant and Freud. The very supposition of an unconscious for example, implies a consciousness from which the unconscious is separated. Freud's system is predicated on this division. Further, we saw the psyche constituted by a collection of fragments as a result of its identifications. While the psyche is split, however, there seems to be a way that even with Freud, the splitting itself is the effect of a more fundamental interest in, or drive to, unification. The drive to unity was seen in Civilization and Its Discontents in the maintaining of the quiescence of a pre-egoic state. In this case what is perhaps the most primary move of repression can be characterized as the repression of consciousness itself in this drive to quiescence. It is this more fundamental move to quiescence which paradoxically produces the split. The desire for quiescence or unity is not thematized only in Civilization and Its Discontents but also in The Interpretation of Dreams of 1900, where the wish motivating the dream was described as that which seeks a diminuition of the tensions or the "avoidance of an accumulation of excitations".49 The wish seeks to return to a state of quiescent unity. Its effect is read as a distortion, or deduced because of its distorted production or appearance, but the underlying drive - as in the case of Kant's reason - is to unity. In Beyond the Pleasure Principle of 1920, Freud advanced a theory of a new physical agency which opposed his own position that the motive force of the dream was the fulfillment of a wish. In spite of this new opposing thematic, what remained constant was that the drive of this new agency "beyond" the pleasure principle, nonetheless sought a state of originary calm. With this text Freud was attempting to take note of dreams and thoughts which simply did not respond to the pleasure principle. Such dreams suggested that far from avoiding unpleasure, the 48 Ibid., p. 334. 49 Freud, Dreams, p. 637.</page><page sequence="16">82 DAVID E. PETTIGREW psyche invites and repeats it. Freud speculated that the repetition of a trauma, or a traumatic dream might be an attempt by the psyche to restore an earlier state of things - an exemplication of the conservative nature of living substance.50 Indeed, what Freud means here by "conservative" is the absolute quiescence of death itself. He writes: If we are to take it as a truth that knows no exception that every living thing dies for internal reasons then we shall be compelled to say that the aim of all life is death and looking backwards that inanimate things existed before living ones.51 To illustrate his point more clearly, he makes a link between the repetition of a trauma and the process of conscious perception. Seeking to maintain or recapture its state of originary quiescence, the psyche strives to deaden the stimuli by which it is invaded. In this process, he writes: A crust v .Aild thus be thoroughly formed which would at last be so thoroughly baked through by stimulation that it presents the most favourable possible conditions for the reception of stimuli . . . incapable of any further modification. By its death this outer layer has saved all the deeper ones from a similar fate . . . Protection against stimuli is an almost more important function for the living organism than the reception of stimuli.52 The psyche undertakes this perception-deadening-perception because the representation of what is lost portrays the loss itself. The binding of the perceptual stimuli and the holding of it as a representation of what was represents the loss of the presence or a return to death. The representation is a monument to what is lost. The psyche does not retain the memory of the object per se but the memory of its loss or death. It is this inorganic state - the loss - that the psyche desires for itself. This originary unity emerges as primary for Freud's thematic, and in Beyond the Pleasure Principle he himself invokes the amount of Aristophanes and the theme of the desire to return to a complete state to which we referred earlier.53 On this account the entire contents of the unconscious could be said to be manifestations of this death wish. The super-ego, identifications, narcissistic fixations would all be representations of the loss of the object. The representations would not be held for the sake of the object but rather for the sake of its loss. Identifications would function as monuments to a loss signifying death itself. From this perspective the status of the contents of the unconscious - which earlier 50 Sigmund Freud, Beyond the Pleasure Principle (1920), trans. James Stachey (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1961), p. 30. 51 Ibid., p. 32. 52 Ibid., p. 21. 53 Ibid., p. 51.</page><page sequence="17">RELATION OF PHILOSOPHY AND PSYCHOANALYSIS 83 in this paper served to differentiate Freud from Kant - could now be called into question and reevaluated. No longer substantial or a plenitude, they portray or represent a desire for their erasure, along with that of the conscious psyche itself. V Thus while we began with an indication that a reflection on Kant and Freud would provide a clear basis for a distinction between philosophy and psychoanalysis, the gap between the two thinkers seems to be diminishing. The three points of apparent divergence: the treatment of the unconscious as opposed to the treatment of the subject, the contents of the unconciousness as opposed to the content-free a priori, and the fragmentation of the psyche as opposed to reason as unconditioned have given way to three points of probable convergence. First, we saw that Freud's notion that "everything conscious has a preliminary unconscious stage", functions analogously to the Kantian a priori as the condition of the possibility of giving form and thought to the object of its experience. With Freud the unconscious gave form to the dream as a form of thinking in the same way that Kant's subject gives form to the object of its experience.54 It was Freud who invoked Kant's problematic of the phenomenal and the noumenal, with an unconscious known only as an appearance and not in-itself. Second, we have seen their projects reveal an analogous function as each seeks an originary foundation or grounding of the subject. Each thematizes a drive which seeks to unify the subject while producing at the same time a paradoxical splitting. With Kant, the drive to unity appeared in two forms. The first deduced the necessary and universal foundations that must be the case if we are to know the world as we say we know it. The second found reason in conflict with itself seeking the unconditioned unity of its experience. The a priori, then, as unifying is at the same a division. Kant sets up the a priori over against the empirical. Kant's work calls forth the paradox of the subject that knows itself as it appears to itself and not as it is in itself. Reason sets up a dialectic with itself to posit an unconditioned realm which he says it cannot know and to which its access is problematical. To use Freud's terminology, the Kantian subject is split topographically - through its description as different places or zones, and dynamically - with the impotent drive to the unconditioned. Similarly, with Freud we saw a primary drive to an originary, pre egoic quiescence. As with Kant the drive takes different forms. As early as his Project for a Scientific Psychology the dynamic of the neuronic system is aimed at the diminuition of excitation, setting itself up as an apparatus in which stimuli can be either discharged or bound and 54 Freud, Dreams, p. 545.</page><page sequence="18">84 DAVID E. PETTIGREW controlled.55 Strikingly, we saw that the basic wish, in all its arbitrary, capricious and uninhibited style, turns out to be a functional discharge of excitation so as to allow for a return to quiescence. Finally, with Beyond the Pleasure Principle we saw the theme of a drive to the originary unity of death. However, as with Kant, Freud's drive to unity produced a self-division. The unconscious is not conscious. It is veiled by consciousness. The drive to quiescence produced divisions within the psyche. In the Project for a Scientific Psychology we see the creation of a differential field or milieu of memory traces designed to facilitate the control of external stimuli. This deadened crust contains memory traces which are monuments to the stimulus thus harnessed and to the loss of the stimulus itself. Third and finally, each thinker's project thematizes a drive to unity which not only produces self-division but rests on a foundation which is abyssal. Kant's a priori is nothing which can be characterized empiric ally. Although it is true that the a priori gives an objective form to the object of perception it is nonetheless in and of itself nothing that is, or, we might say, it is nothingness. Nor can it be thought or appropriated in a direct way. It is deduced or assumed. The ideas of pure reason, which unify our reason, are themselves unknowable. They are posed as a problem with no solution. Kant writes that: "Unconditioned necessity, which we so indispensably require as the last bearer of all things, is for human reason the veritable abyss."56 Even with respect to the status of the noumenal in Kant's practical corpus, something we have not considered but which can be referred to briefly, the moral law is something which is simply not accessible to phenomenal/sensible experience. Kant asserts that the unconditioned moral law posited by reason is incomprehensible or Unbegrieflichkeit51 With Freud the drive to unity is thematised in one way as a wish or desire. This desire does not have a particular emotional quality, for it is but a desire for unity or quiescence. Perhaps the desire for unity is best considered as a state which is void of emotion or anything that can be described empirically. The unity is abyssal as the inorganic and quiescent state of death itself. The unconscious, and the drive to unification seem both foundational and inaccessible in a way that is analogous to Kant's ideas of pure reason. They are proposed as what must be the case, as an abiding and unconditioned necessity, if the psyche is to be understood and interpreted. Access to the unconscious as it is in itself, however, is problematical. On the one hand, it is interpreted in terms of symptoms to which it presumably gives form. On the other hand, it is described as inhabited by certain contents. Yet 55 Sigmund Freud, "Project for a Scientific Psychology" in The Origins of Psycho analysis trans. Eric Mosbacher and James Strachey (New York: Basic Books, 1954), pp. 361 and 367. 56 Kant, CPR, p. 513. 57 Kant, Groundwork, p. 131.</page><page sequence="19">RELATION OF PHILOSOPHY AND PSYCHOANALYSIS 85 these contents, as we have seen, represent the loss which the drive to unity desires. Thus it seems that Freud's and Kant's projects are analogous to an extent which suggests Freud's probable dependence on Kant's philo sophical problematic of a self founded on a drive or function which, while seeking unification, splits the self and remains quixotically abyssal.58 This is not to say that "Freud is a Kantian", or that their projects are the same, but only to recognize the function on which the analogy can be built.59 To the extent that Freud's problematic appears to depend on Kant, his many references to Kant call for some consideration. They are frequent and varied. For the most part Freud is respectful, as in the case of his own analogy to Kant in the relation between the conscious and unconscious and the phenomenal and the noumenal. At other times Freud seems to be mocking Kant. In the Schreber case he writes: 58 Freud seemed self-conscious about such a motif in his work when he wrote at page 190-1 in "The Economic Problem in Masochism", "As will be remembered we have conceived the principle which governs all mental processes as a special case of Fechners tendency to stability, and consequently have ascribed to the mental apparatus the aim of extinguishing, or at least maintaining at as low a level as possible, the quantities of excitation flowing into it. . . . From this it would follow that every 'pain' coincides with a heightening, every pleasure with a lowering, of the stimulus tension existing in the mind; the Nirvana principle . . . would be entirely in the service of the death instincts (the aim of which is to lead our throbbing existence into the stability of an inorganic state). . . . Unfortunately, this view cannot be correct." However, Freud does not entirely rectify this interpretation to which his work leads. He seems to suggest that the reduction of tension does not rest simply on the relative status of pleasure and pain, and is rather linked to a certain rhythmic "something" due to the "periodical duration of the changes, the risings and fallings of the volume of stimuli." But here Freud concludes that ultimately, "We do not know". In addition to the thematic in Freud's work of a drive to an unconditioned unity which is quixotically abyssal and thus analogous to Kant's characterization of the activity of reason, we see that Freud speaks explicitly of an activity of reason. He asserts at page 151 in "The Question of a Weltanschauung" that humanity's only response to the illusion of religion is to be provided by reason: "that intellect - the scientific spirit, reason - may in the process of time establish a dictatorship in the mental life of man. The nature of reason is a guarantee that afterwards it will not fail to give man's emotional impulses and what is determined by them the position they deserve. But the common compulsion exercised by such a dominance of reason wjll prove to be the strongest uniting bond among men and lead the way to future actions. Whatever, like religion's prohibition against thought, opposes such development, is a danger for the future of mankind." Freud's description of the activity of reason in this case is remarkably similar to the heuristic aspect of Kant's ideas of pure reason. He writes at page 139 in the same text that the Weltanschauung of science assumes the uniformity of the explanation of the universe, but only as programme, the fulfillment of which is relegated to the future. 59 Nor do we say that Kant was a Freudian, but he did engage in what seemed to have the makings of a therapeutic correspondence with Maria von Herbert, the sister of Baron Franz Paul von Herbert who left his family for a number of years to study with Kant. Their letters are published in, Immanuel Kant, Philosophical Correspondence 1759-99, trans, ed. Arnulf Sweig, (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1967).</page><page sequence="20">86 DAVID E. PETTI GREW In Schreber's system the two principle elements of his delusion (his transformation into a woman and his favoured relation to God) are united in his assumption of a feminine attitude toward God. It will be a necessary part of our task to show that there is an essential genetic relation between these two elements. Or else our attempts will leave us in the unsure position described in Kant's famous simile in the Critique of Pure Reason - we shall be like a man holding a sieve under a he goat while someone else milks it.60 This citation seems appropriate except for the fact that other references to Kant take on the same deferential but jesting tone. Twice in the New Introductory Lectures Freud's refers to Kant's pronouncement which couples the conscious within us to the starry heavens. In the same text Freud attempted to distinguish a timeless id from Kant's transcendental ego in terms which are problematical, if not incorrect.61 In the light of Freud's dependence on Kant, the vicissitudinal character of these references take on an almost oedipal character. Further, given the nature of the dependence on Kant, his denial that philosophy has provided a model of mind seems like a symptomatic resistance. Freud denies philosophy while appropriating Kant and Plato. Such references suggest that Freud is repeating without remembering - a condition he himself treats of in the 1914 paper "Recollection, Repetition and Working Through." Freud found that in analysis a patient's behavior was a part of a defence against underlying traumas. As the repressed was transferred to repetitive actions, the repeating and acting out of the repressed trauma was precisely what prevented the patient from realizing what it represents. Freud asserted that the analyst must take note of the symptoms of resistance in this light and use them as part of a comprehensive plan for the interpretation of the resistance.62 Freud's own repetitions with respect to philosophy might be read sympathetically and worked through in their association with the Kantian problematic as well as other aspects of the history of philosophy cited in this paper. Yet even as we emphasize Freud's Kantian 60 Sigmund Freud Three Case Histories (1911), ed. Philip Rieff (New York: Collier Books, 1963), p. 132. 61 Freud, "Dissection of the Personality", p. 61. Here Freud attempts to differentiate the id from Kant's forms of space and time stating that there is nothing in the "id that corresponds to the idea of time. There is no recognition of the passage of time and - a thing that is most remarkable and awaits consideration in philosophical thought - no alteration in its mental apparatus is produced by the passage of time." This is an odd statement because the transcendental form of time is itself free of empirical time. If we maintain, however, that the timelessness of the Freudian id is not a transcendental form of time, it does, nonetheless, offer a challenge to the primacy of empirical time. In one sense, in other words, it is not primary to empirical time in the way that Kant's exposition of the pure form of time is, but insofar as the operation of the psyche is concerned, there is a time - the time of the id - which runs alongside and in opposition to empirical time. 62 Sigmund Freud, "Recollecting, Repeating, and Working Through", trans.

We might have expected such a nuance in Freud but it casts an even more interesting light on Kant. It suggests that we might be less concerned with Freud's dependence on Kant and rather consider Kant more thoroughly as a modern thinker whose work establishes a paradigm for contemporary psychoanalysis. Yet it is not simply a retrospective analogy from Freud to Kant which shows Kant to be thematizing a drive to unity which fragments, and is founded on the incomprehensible. The analogy could be seen as originating in the history of philosophy. The analogical mode by which the link is made here between Kant and Freud on the basis of the function in each thinker which unifies, divides, and is abyssal, is itself analogous to Socrates' consideration of the meaning of justice in The Republic as he made the link between the superficially disparate elements in the state and the soul on the basis of the function of control. Following this re-link to the earlier remarks concerning Plato we can pursue our mode of interpretation by analogy with yet another reference to The Republic, where Socrates thematizes what the nature or character of knowledge must be if there is to be knowledge that is worthy of the name. He says that knowledge must be eternal and unchanging, and it must be the truth of the real rather than its mere appearance as changing and multiplicitous.63 But he does not tell us what the truth or the true is. Indeed, the Good, or the highest form which brings unity to the intelligible world seems itself to be inaccessible or incomprehensible. Socrates is only able to refer to it by analogy, stating that the Good illuminates the intelligible world as the sun illuminates the visible, sensible world.64 Various sections of the text can be said to portray, analogically, the primacy of unity in relation to multiplicity. For example, Book I of The Republic begins in the depths of Piraeus and considers the many views of justice, but it concludes on the question of the proper function of the soul. The discussion in Book II of the origin and genesis of the state moves from a consideration of the many parts and needs of society to the single and most important part: the Guardians.65 The discussion of the education of the Guardians moves from the discussion of multiple aspects of form and content to the question of the preparation and character of the soul.66 The thematic transitions, and his own dialectic exhibit the nature of the search for knowledge as well as what such a truth must be like. Socrates tells us that dialectic does away with assumptions and travels up to first principles but we seem otherwise to be left without an answer as to what the Good is.67 The Good is characterized as both necessary and 63 Plato, Republic, p. 190. 66 Ibid., p. 90. 64 Ibid., p. 219. 67 Ibid., p. 255. 65 Ibid., p. 62.</page><page sequence="22">88 DAVID E. PETTIGREW inaccessible in the same way that Kant's ideas of pure reason are indispensable, yet incomprehensible. Plato's intelligible realm is that to which the dialectic of reason drives, and, as in the case of Kant's ideas of pure reason, that realm is what must be the case if there is to be knowledge and if there is to be a principle of unity for reason. Freud's unconscious and its drive to unification was similarly inaccessible - only able to be regarded as an appearance - but nonetheless an indispensable principle on which the project depends. In this sense, Freud's unconscious, that paragon of irrationality, seems captured within the context of a problematic of reason as it has been formulated in the history of philosophy. The unconscious and its operation thematizes an architectonic principle giving unity to its discipline in the same way Plato's Good and Kant's ideas of pure reason give unity to their respective domains. Freud's project rests, then, on a problematic of a teleological unity that is inaccessible yet nonetheless a principle on which the project depends. In this sense it cannot simply be said that philosophy has failed to provide psychoanalysis with a ground for its thought. The analogies we have considered here propose a soil for a critical reformulation of Freud's problematic within the history of philosophy: a terrain in which it can be reconsidered and rediscovered in its full dimensions.
