Pp. xix + 819. 23 x 15 cm. Price 21s. 1 IU Before reviewing, Dr. Howitt's ATative Tribes of South-East Australia it is natural and seemly to congratulate him on the accomplishment of his great work. During forty years he has been busy in collectinrg the fragments of customary laws and beliefs among tribes of which many have succumbed to the ferocity, and the almost equally fatal goodwill, of th-e invading, European. Opium is the latest means of exterminating the Queensland black-" Belgian newspapers will please copy" when we wax virtuous over Belgian misdeeds on the Congo. Dr. Howitt has written not from his owni knowledge alone; he has stirred up aii army of correspondents who have added each his mite. During some tlhirty years of controversy Dr. Howitt has not written one discourteous word, but has displayed a perfect candour and openness of mind,. He knows the value of a docta ignorantia, anid, though firm in his opinions on one or two obscure and debtted points, is not disposed. on others, even to hazard an hypothesis. By necessity Dr. Howitt's work differs in character from that of Messrs, Spenver and Gillen. They write from personal observation of tribes still little contaminated by European contact. He speaks ol the autithority of observers among tribes contaminated, or all but extinct or quite vanished, in several cases, as well as on the basis of his own studies. We cannot precisely estimate the value of evidence from many observers, as we do not even know how far they were masters of the various languages. In some cases, as in that of Mr. Gason among the Dieri, Dr. Howitt is able to rectify earlier&gt; 183 1</page><page sequence="2">No. 116.] MAN. [1904.. statements by more recent research. Much of what he has to say is already familiar to readers of his own and of Dr. Fison's Kamilaroi and Kurnai, and contributions to the Journal of the Anthropological Institute and other learned periodicals. On the first chapter, "The Origin of the Aborigines," I need not comment; his "tentative hypothesis " will be found on pages 32, 33. HJis definitiotn of a (local), " tribe " is already accepted. In my opinion, to write (page 42) that the social divisions " are denoted by class names, or totems, and more frequently by both class names and totems," is rather premature before " class niames " and " totems " have been defined. The terminology used runs thus "Class names " denote the two primary exogamous moieties of a tribe, often styled " phratries," a harmless term as long as it is understood. "Sub-classes " denote the four or eight exogamous divisions (peculiar, I think, to Australia), which some writers call " matrimonial classes," as distinguished from "phratries," or " primary exogamous moieties." Under "totems " are included, by Dr. Howitt, not only the hereditary exogamous kins, usually of plant or animal name, but the personal non-hereditary, non-exogamous plant, animal, or other object of the individual answering to the American nagual, or manitu. We also hear of non- exogamous " sub-totems," of " mortuary totems," and' so forth. Local groups within a tribe of female reckoning of descent are styled "hordes," iu a tribe with male reckoning are termed " clans." As both "1 horde " and " clan " are used in other senses,. especially by American students, I think it would be simpler to call a local grouip in a tribe " a local group,"' leaving " clans " and " hordes " out of the story. Whether to commend or dispraise the scientific caution of Dr. Howitt in presenting- no theory of the origin of totemism, hereditary and exogamous, or of the animal and other- names which mark the " classes " often; the " sub-classes " sometimes (page 111) ; the exogamous totem kins almost always; I am uncertain. I could wish that he had offered a list of the names of " classes " aud " sub-classes," with the translations of these names, where they are known. Certainly the " classes " often bear animal names ;. indeed, they do so in almost every case where their meaning is ascertained. Let us take the Gournditch-Mara tribe (pages 124, 125, 250). Mr. Stahle describes their organisation thus:- Classes. Totems. Sub-totems. Krokitch. White cockatoo. Five. Kaputch. Black cockatoo. Eight. Now, here the two " class " names-Krokitch and Kaputch-nzean white and black cockatoo, which are given in English as " totems." This is plain from the report of Mr. Dawson, speaking of " the tribes which are to the east of the Gournditch-Mara,. and to which the latter obviously belongs." Mr. Dawson gives here no "classes," but offers five "totems," of which the first, Kuurokcetch (long-billed cockatoo), is clearly Krokitch, while the third, Kappatch (Banksian cockatoo), is as certainly Kaputch. Here, then, we have two species of cockatoo, which are, in fact, two " class " (" phratry ") narnes, rather than names of totems in the phratries. This, in MrF Dawson's account, is quite clear. The myth says that the male ancestor of the tribe was a long-billed cockatoo, whose wife was a Banksian cockatoo. Dr. Howitt adds,. " Their sons and daughters belonged to the class of their mother." Buit whence came the three totems-pelican, boa snake, and quail? Dr. Howitt does not here say;. Mr. ,Dawson does. The totems came in through exogamous marriages made by the cockatoos. It is clear from other information (page 125) that two cockatoo-named " classes" (phratries), with animal-named totem kins in their " classes," are common. Mr. StThle's, account, we repeat, gives two "classes" with urntranslated names, and gives the translations of their two names as "totenis "9 [ 184 1</page><page sequence="3">1904.] MAN. [No. 116. This is unsatisfactory. We need, of all things, a thorough linguistic examination of the meaniings of the names of " classes " and " sub-classes." At present, when translated, they seem usually, as in the case of totems, to be named after animals. There must be some reason at the back of the marriage laws in whiclh " classes," exogamous, often of animal name, contain "totems," exogamous, usually of plant or animal name ; while in more advanced tribes "'sub-classes," exogamous-occasionally of animal names, in other cases of names of unknown meaning-exist. I endeavour to disengage Dr. Ho1witt's theory of these facts, as far as he has a theory. First in time came (page 89) "the division of the people of the tribe into twa classes," exogamous. Why or how was the division made? Two legends (Dieri, Wuranjerri) agree that " the division of the tribe was made with intent to reguilate the relation of the sexes." But, if the relation of the sexes were previously quite unregulated, why in the world should anyone want to regulate them, or how could anyone even dream that they needed reguilation by tribal authority ? Again, if two myths say that the division of the tribes was made for the purpose of sexual regulation, plenty of other myths give totally different accounts of the whole affair, as Dr. Howitt.well knows. Dieri myth (page 481) says that originally people married withini their totems, " this occasioned great confusion, and sexual disorder " becamie predominant." The elders, therefore, decreed that totems should be exoga- mous. But, of course, "d disorder" could ouly be perceived by personis accustomed to "order," that is, to totemistic exogamy. Such myths are purely aetiological. We have not advanced one step, so far. Again (page 143), Dr. Howitt asks "how the two exogamous class divisions " originated ?" He thinks that it was " by the division of an original whole, which I " have referred to as the Undivided Communle." But why was the Undivided divided ? Well (pages 133, 134), it was not Undivided, or, not for long. Economic conditions, and "individual likes and dislikes," says ouir author, kept perpetually breaking up the the Undivided Commune "into two or more CoInmunes, of the same character." We entirely agree, so far, buit we add that, in such small groups, the " likes and dislikes "- love and jealoisy -would inevitably regulate in some degree sexual relations, even if hitherto, they had beeni quite unregulated. rihis appears undeniable. Dr. HoIwitt, however, supposes tthat all these little new "communes " would meet, "at certain. gatherings . . . or on great ceremonial occasions," and then woulc behave "as when the Lake Eyre tribes reunite "-that is, licentiously (page 174). But how can we take it,for granted that the primeval groups, perhaps hostile, (lid meet for " great ceremonies " ? If they did, is the idea that they then and there established,. purposefully, the two "classes " which prevent union of brothers and sisters uterine ? What harm did they see in stich unions, unless the jealousy of sires had already prohibited them in the tiny " Cornraunes"? But why were animal names so often given to the "classes " ? Wheuce, moreover, and why, came the exogamous totem. kins within the " classes" ? I do not answer the seventeen lines of criticism which Dr. Howitt bestows on my oxvn theory of the origin of totems, as given by me in Social Origins, but the natuire of my reply is obvious. Dr. flowitt agrees with Messrs. Spencer and Gillen, that totem groups existed, before- exogamy, for magical purposes, b)ut he does not know " how it was that mnen assumed " the names of objects, which, in fact, must have been the commencement of totemism " (page 153). He guesses that a man may bave dreamed that he was a plant or beast,. and so may have "d developed the idea of relationship wiLh animals, or even with plants" (page 154). Then how did the dream-plant or animal come to descend in the female line, and why does the object mark the exogamous division ? Were the supposed pre-existing non-exogamous totem groups simply commanded to be exogamaus at the given moment when the tribe, on "a great ceremonial occasion," divided itself [ 185 ]</page><page sequence="4">Nos. 116-117.] MAN. [1904. into the two "classes," one set of totems being placed in one class, the other set in the other ? These are natural questions, but I shall ask no more out of a long list which occurs to the inquiring mind. One may express, however, some doubts as to whether one totem kin in a " class " is ever restricted to marriage with just one totem kin in the other class. Messrs. Spencer and Gillen, in their new work, add nothing to the confessedly vague information given as to this point of Urabunnla law in their previous volume. Why the Urabunna facts cannot be ascertained, wlhen intelligence on matters apparently, much more esoteric is abuindant, one does not know. A Mr. Boultbee (page 194) is responsible for the statement that a one-totem to one-totem restriction exists in tribes with the Mukwara-Kilpara " classes." One suspects some confusion here, and, of course, all statements made long ago, about tribes now extinct, are of limited value as evidence. A point, among manly others, which I hLve often felt to be perplexing is this tribes (A) with no " sub-classes," but merely vitli " classes," totems, and femnale reckoning, do not permit father and daughter marriage, though their " classes " do not prevent it. Tribes (B), more advanced, have " sub-classes," of which-as Mr. J. G. F'razer points out to Dr. Howitt-" the efect is to prevent the marriage of parents with children." Now, how come tribes (A) to prevent such uniions -without any machinery of " sub- classes," while tribes (B) appear to have found that machinery necessary ? Is it not also very curious (page 500) that (as I understand Dr. Howitt) the tribes most advanced socially, do not, as a rule, believe in "an anthropomorphic supernatural being, who lives " in the sky, and is supposed to have some kind of influence on the morals of the natives," wl?iile the less socially advanced tribes often "incline to think there is a God, or something very like one," to quote Clough. If I do not misapprebend Dr. Howitt we are here in perfect agreement, and I can give examples of the Baiame belief as early as 1829-31, fifteen years earlier than Mr. Manning's account of 1844-45, and prior to missionary influence in the district (pages 501, 502). In my space I can onily "scratch with a hoe " at the vast and fertile field of Dr. Howitt's labours. To criticise his work thoroughly demands a separate treatise, and I have already lifted up my voice against Dr. Howitt's theory that the " Pirraru " custom is a survival of, or a proof of, " Group Marriage " in the past. To this and other topics I hope to return in a new work now in hand. One must condole with Dr Howitt and his readers on a sadly inadequate index to his book. With some of his opinions I am constrained to disagree, but his services to science are such that we may doubt whether without his long and exemplary labours, and without his eKample, anthropology would have more thau an inkling of the whole interesting subject of Atustralian society, custom, and belief.
