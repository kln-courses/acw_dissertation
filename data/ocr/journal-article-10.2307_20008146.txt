<plain_text><page sequence="1">Julia A. Lamm, The Living God: Schleiermacher's Theological Appropriation of SPinoza. (The Pennsylvania State University Press, I996.) Pp. 246. This is a very good book indeed, on the value and cogency of Schleiermacher's Christian theology - even if it is so in spite of its specific focus. And even that qualification implies no negative criticism as such. It merely expresses a theologian's preference for books which focus primarily on clear understand ing and positive proposal of all that is best in the thought of a theologian whose work has stood the test of time, with only such reference to positive and negative influences on him in his own time and place as may be necessary for understanding; and it expresses also the hope that Julia Lamm will soon write such a book. She already shows, if only incidentally in this book, how much better she understands Schleiermacher than do any of a number of his theological critics, who range from Barth through Barthians, for whom Schleiermacher remains a whipping boy, to Richard Niebuhr, who accuses Schleiermacher of dissolving God's transcendence only because he himself confuses transcendence with externality, and Pannenberg who quite wilfully confuses absolute dependence with relative dependence, ... and so on. And she can do this, at least partly because she understands so much better than most students of Schleiermacher the structural logic of his Glaubenslehre. This is a structural logic which so few seem to see, although the many have no excuse for not seeing it, since Schleiermacher himself advertises it from the very first pages. In short, the logic is that the first part of the work is an abstraction, as Lamm puts it, with respect to the second part. That is to say,</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 113 the distinctive experience in which the true God is truly, if progressively, encountered (namely, the experience of regeneration in Christ) is nameable only in terms of general patterns of human experience, especially the deepest or highest of these, in the cosmos, and that naming in turn changes with the general philosophical cultures of different times and places. But these general experiences, much less the ideas and nouns that at any time and place express them, are never the reality. Experience is always concrete, as is (according to Hegel) truth. So one may well begin with the 'abstract' analysis of such experience and naming, before going on to describe as best one may by means of these the concrete experience of these mighty, cosmic, universal, transcen dent processes which are just what they are, and not other. To the question, why not start with the specific experience of regeneration by God through Christ, and later go on to the general categories?, the only answer can be: one would then be using these categories uncritically from the beginning; and the persisting need to give a critical account of them, such as theology requires, but now in 'part two', would then prove, in Schleiermacher's own terms, anti-climactic. And if one quite refused to perform this proper theo logical task at all, then one would sooner or later suffer the relative indignity of having someone else do it for one - as is the case of commentators on the Kantian (if not Hegelian) underpinning of Barth's Supreme Divine Subject. Julia Lamm then leads us through a clear analysis and cogent presentation of Schleiermacher's Christian vision of a God neither too anthro pomorphically conceived (as in the old, Greek, metaphysic in which God first generated the cosmos noetos in the Word, and then byfiat the cosmos aesthetos through which we currently sojourn), nor reduced to a pantheism in which God is identified with the totality and interaction of finite entities; a vision of the One, which is not just a name for the abstract idea of a unity of all existing things, nor yet a name for a totally extramundane entity, additional as an object, however infinitely superior, to the objects that make up the world (here is the point at which Schleiermacher understands that trans cendence is the correlative of immanence, not the contrary to internal in the world); a vision of a God who can be known as wholly originating and universally pervasive active force sustaining all finite entities in their inevi table interconnectedness and mutually relative dependence; known in the deepest recesses of the human consciousness/spirit which is purely receptive to the sheer unearned givenness, the gratia of the promising profligacy of being, at a depth below knowledge, as those unfortunately named mystics insist, where the source-presence cannot be named (for again it is not an extra being); known concretely and existentially as a love that is the real content and aim of all other divine attributes, but not sentimental, discrimi natory or wilful in too anthropomorphic a fashion; a love that regenerates continually, pouring out life in a healing and progressive abundance, in the</page><page sequence="3">I I4 RELIGIOUS STUDIES experience of which no final distinction is needed between nature and history, and which is Christic in that the Urbild (the originating, rather than a merely exemplary or Vorbild form of it) is present in the history of the world in the person of Christ. And so back to the opening qualification. All of this, and more, is presented to us, in the course of a most impressively clear and cogent analysis, in accordance with the specific focus of the book, of the relationship of Schleiermacher to Spinoza. Spinoza himself is made to appear, as he did to Schleiermacher, through the filters of those who admired him, like Lessing, and those who resisted him, like Jacobi, and through the filters of the intervention of Kant and the emergence of a Post-Kantian Spinozism. And there is then a most detailed, and again a most clear and cogent presentation of these modified Spinozist themes and of Schleiermacher's nuanced and changing attitudes towards them, ranging from Schleiermacher's early essays on Spinoza to the final edition of his great Glaubenslehre. Had the book not consistently shown such fine insight into Schleiermacher's own thought in all its major parts (with the exception of a substantial account of his Christology, which the focus of the book did not require), the present reviewer might not have persisted with it to the end. Books of this predominantly historical genre tend to be repetitive of themes traced through earlier and later documents, and to conduct the analysis and argument too much in terms of 'isms', because that is how combatants historically conduct their debates, and both these features leave one impatient for more systematic analysis and synthesis. But this again is ideosyncratic. It leaves intact the impression that this book is an excellent example of the historical theology genre, for those who prefer that kind of thing. And, furthermore, it yields the hope that we may see from the pen of this author a more systematic presentation and proposal of Schleiermacher's theology. She has an understanding of Schleiermacher which is palpably superior to more established theologians, and which is more promising for contemporary theological needs (in ecology, for instance) than many other brands of Reformed theology.
