The authors, from seven different countries, are scholars and filmmakers who are generally acknowledged as the international authorities in the field. The volume covers ethnographic filming and its relation with the cinema and television; applications of filming to anthropological research; the uses of still photography, archives and videotape; subdisciplinary applications in ethnography, archaeology, bioanthropology, museology and ethnohistory; and overcoming the funding problems of film production. Several of the articles from the earlier edition have been updated by their authors but the coverage of television programming and funding is entirely new. Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co., P.O.

Danforth Greeks and Macedonians are presently engaged in an often heated dispute involving competing claims to a single identity. Here Loring Danforth examines the Macedonian conflict in light of contemporary theoretical work on ethnic nationalism, the construc- tion of national identities and cultures, the invention of tradition, and the role of the state in the process of building a nation. The conflict is set in the broader context of Balkan history and in the more narrow context of the recent disintegration of Yugoslavia.
