<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS FICTION Birds of America, by Mary McCarthy. The big news about Miss McCarthy's new book would seem, anywhere in the course of reading it, to be its warmth. A novelist noted for her use of acid and vitriol has here produced, not precisely a novel but a work, didactic in tone, whose principal characters are a loving son and a lovable mother, in which even divorced husbands are likeable, the ugliness of modernity is hateful, and home, art, old days, old ways, lovely and to be valued. Of Peter, student offspring of a Jewish intellectual father and Gentile harpsichordist mother, married twice more since, it is pointed out—the reader gets con siderable of such steering—that he is a sort of modern Candide. His travels take him from Los Angeles (hideous) to New Eng land (fading beauty) to Paris (corrupt) and Rome (contaminated). Peter differs from his real-life contemporaries mainly in being tolerant of his elders; he is, in fact, an obedi ent son. Throughout the book the image is built up of him, together with his mother, as a curiously united whole, as if an arche type of the age-old concept of love ex pressed as mother and child. This ancient certitude, this ceremony of innocence, is however, utterly drowned on the very last page of the book, after Peter has been wounded by a black swan (negative aspect of that deity who impregnated Leda). Not till then does the realization begin seeping into the reader's mind of what Miss Mc Carthy may really have been about here. Far from extolling established values, she has destroyed them, by putting in their place a new archetype: the woman of the future. Mother and son do make a whole, in this conception, but in a new relationship —woman's ego, her masculine thought, nourished by her feminine feeling, issues forth alone into a world where such a sight was never seen before. The whole of Miss McCarthy's career—rebel against religious orthodoxy, sexual noncomformist, intellec tual and political iconoclast, falls into place: "Birds of America" is a parable of her de velopment. Louder than the loudest pro tests, clearer than the coolest psychological logic, this warm, readable narrative liber ates the cold truth about her mind, unique in its own right. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich $6.95 A Cry of Absence, by Madison Jones. Violence, crime, guilt, and retribution are constituent elements in Mr. Jones's fiction. His fifth novel is no exception, beginning as it does with the murder of a Negro in an unnamed Southern town during the late 1950's when racial tension was notably higher than it is today, and ending with the suicide of one of the principal charac ters, who though not directly involved is nevertheless responsible for much of the unrest between whites and blacks. Some pertinent comments are made by the author to illustrate how Yankee newcomers, in sensitive to Southern customs and traditions, add their substantial share to the social problem, but they are portrayed, too, as being impossibly self-righteous barbarians with no manners or breeding. Attention is not upon them, however, but on the Freudian difficulties of a mother in the town brought up in the old style and mis takenly trying to inculcate in her two sons the attitudes of a bygone age toward Ne groes and their rights, who in the process creates monsters. As a sociological study Mr. Jones's book is less than profound; as an analysis of a psychological situation he is entirely successful, especially when he allows his talents free rein and develops at length that sense of dread and anxiety where he shows himself to be, as heretofore, incomparable. Croivn $5.95 Ancient History, by Joseph McElroy. Form dominates the latest novel by Mr. McElroy at the expense of content, and his readers, perhaps not so dazzled as he with the experiment, may wonder at his implausi ble premise in choosing to write a book ostensibly composed by an intruder in the apartment of a man who may or may not have committed suicide, some time after the removal of the corpse and before the subsequent, detailed investigation was un dertaken by police. Probabilities aside, the discursive account bearing tangentially upon the deceased fails to accomplish the author's purpose for one perfectly valid and obvious civ</page><page sequence="2">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS reason: as a monologue with action reported rather than dramatized it carries a vestigial quality unlikely to sustain interest even for dedicated readers, piqued by curiosity alone to see how far such a venture may take a conscientious writer. At very least the au thor has supplied a not inconsiderable exer cise in preciosity. Knopf $6.95 McBee's Station, by Elise Sanguinetti. With her usual aplomb, finesse, and facil ity the author allows her simple tale to unfold with deceptive ease as she follows the career of her memorable protagonist, an elderly widow blessed with a green thumb and cursed with the burden of an apparently worthless son addicted to writ ing as a prospective means of livelihood. One may in turn sympathize with the mother, or lose patience with her opacity and excessive patience, just as one might share the exasperations of her son and his struggles to find companionship and under standing within the confines of a small Georgia town where he is penniless and a virtual prisoner of circumstances. Mrs. Sanguinetti faces up bravely to the prob lems of integration brought about when the son becomes socially involved with an intellectual Negress, not only bravely, but with comprehension and tolerance. As au thor she resolves her various problems with out artistic compromises that otherwise could have reduced her novel to the level of pulp fiction; she has with accustomed adroitness satisfied her own conscience and pleased her readers with precisely enough sweetness to reward them, neatly avoiding a saccharine finish that would have spoiled an excellent book. Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston $6.9s Jungle Lovers, by Paul Theroux. All the ease and polish apparent in the author's previous books is once again on view,'as in the present instance with two principal figures he deftly portrays the plight of a hapless insurance agent deep in darkest Africa, quite intent on selling poli cies to the natives as a form of salvation, and a ruthless soldier-of-fortune, also American, whose sole interest in the tiny republic where all the action takes place is one of absolute exploitation. Such situa tions with their scarcely concealed risibili ties and inherent ironies allow Mr. Theroux ample scope for his rapidly developing talents. His message to whites in Africa is direct and immediate: Go Home! Houghton Mifflin $5.95 Babi Yar, by A. Anatoli (Kuznetsov). A. Anatoli, known as Anatoli Kuznetsov until his defection from the USSR in 1969, has written what he calls "a document in the form of a novel." It is an extraordinary book, detailing the author's experiences as a boy in Kiev during the Nazi occupation. While the book has considerable literary merits, it is even more striking from the political perspective. This version presents the complete text of the novel, including substantial portions removed by Soviet censors when it was published in Moscow in 1966, and also including materials added since the author reached the West. Materi als originally cut out by the censor are clearly indicated by heavier type; the reader thus is provided with a unique and fascinating picture of Soviet censorship. "Babi Yar" is an impressive work of litera ture. As a document of Soviet cultural con trols, it is even more powerful. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux $10 POETRY Love &amp; Fame, by John Berryman. Much of "Love &amp; Fame" is a new kind of poetry for John Berryman. Conver sational, colloquial, prosy-—the poems are shamelessly autobiographical, returning again and again to Berryman's first loves, middle loves, on-going loves, and to those experiences which determined him an artist. Best of all, there is humor. One does not turn to poetry for fun these days, but there is fun here, unsubtle and out-in-the open: "My intense friend was tall &amp; strongly made,/almost too handsome—&amp; he was afraid/his penis was too small./We mooted it, we did everything but examine it/ whether in se or by comparison/to the great red joy a pecker ought to be/to pump a woman ragged. Only kid sisters,/he mut tered, want to somersault with me." And yet these are strangely wearing poems. The autobiography never quite becomes deeply elvi</page><page sequence="3">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS personal; the names and places begin to bore; the stories start to sound alike. One is grateful for some of the poems in Parts III and IV of the volume, poems in which Berryman reverts to a more familiar, even conventional, manner and talks about more time-honored things. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux $6.50 Selected Poe?ns, by Howard Moss. Since 1946 Howard Moss has been a steady and reliable contributor to American letters, not only as poet but as editor and critic as well. This collection contains those poems he wishes to preserve from his six previous collections and includes seven new poems. As with any collection of selected poems, the book may be read as a chart of the poet's development, a journey that brings Moss to the present stage of his career, at which point he concludes that poetry is for him "a rational derangement/ Requiring that you forget technique/And concentrate on what is harder." Which is to say that he is after a kind of truth that technique alone can never bring him to. This is not an admission of failure to achieve technical mastery, for whatever aspect of technique you choose, Moss is among the most skillful practitioners. As for subject matter, Moss has always moved with sure knowledge through the "dark stone canyon" of the city, taking his reader into the buildings, into the people. But whether in the city or the country or be side the sea, his concerns are universal— death (our "second nature" he suggests), mutability, the apprehension of reality, the losses and gains of love—and these concerns are never lost to abstraction. Although a rightful portion of the poems present a frantic, clamorous, and despairing human ity, there is a tenacity, a redeeming comic vision, a positive voice to be found through out the book. These aspects taken together convince one that Moss has come the neces sary distance and is now well into that harder realm of realization he has worked for, that realm beyond technique. It is a labor that should not go unnoticed or unrewarded. Atheneum $6.9) A Program for Survival, by Gibbons Ruark. This superb collection of lyrics immedi ately establishes Ruark as a major young poet. A careful use of his senses is his beginning, but it is his language that per mits poem after poem to shock with its beauty. He explores marriages and deaths, war, trapped miners, and the covering of children, penetrating to their essence as well as his own. "Orpheus Singing in the Forest" will soon be in any twentieth-cen tury anthology; "A Screech Owl's Lament" is one of the finest elegies in English. Al though rather traditional in form, his poems do not reveal naked influences so he may experiment more in the future. But here is a grand beginning. The handsome dust jacket gives a beautiful book its cover to judge by. Virginia I3.75 Findings, by Richard Howard. These are findings perhaps in the sense that over half the book is given over to poems in which the poet assumes or "finds" the voice of someone else: Browning on the day of his death, Hofmannsthal, Leo pardi, someone mysteriously connected with Friedrich's landscape "The Chalk Cliffs of Rügen" (possibly one of the char acters of the painting itself), a snake-swal lower in nineteenth-century London, and others. The language is graceful, the diction faultless and sometimes dazzling, and the thoughts obviously those of a trained in telligence, but finally there is an effete qual ity that seems to pervade Howard's poetry and diminish the positive effects that have accrued. Athenemn $3.95 Tangled Hair, translated from the Japanese by Sanford Goldstein and Seishi Shinoda. These 165 tanka are a selection from the "Midaregami" of the poetess, Akiko Yosano; the original volume was published in 1901, just before her marriage to "Tekkan the Tiger," founder of "The New Poetry Brotherhood of Tokyo." Akiko thus repre sents a voice in the effort to revivify the decadent poetry of the Restoration. The translators have played fair with the reader; the kanji-kana, the römaji, and the English translation are given here, along with a set of notes for each of the poems. In spite, however, of careful selection by the transla tors, it seems doubtful on all counts that Akiko can ever be regarded as one of the great poetesses of Japan. Purdue lS-95 clxiv</page><page sequence="4">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS LITERARY STUDIES Blake's Illustrations to the Poems of Gray, by Irene Tayler. Critics have recently come to see that illustrations constitute a source for inter preting the poem. In the last few years there have been studies of the illustrations to Thomson's poems, to Milton's poems, and to Dickens's fiction. Now adding to the work done on Blake by Jean Hagstrum, John E. Grant, and David V. Erdman, Irene Tayler offers a study of Blake's illustrations to Gray. The book reprints the illustrations in black and white; only the frontispiece is in color. The author raises a number of very perceptive questions about interpretation. Her view is that in the early poems Blake builds out Gray's figurative language visu ally and that the illustrations develop "cer tain congruent suggestions not actually present in Gray and not necessarily notice able to someone who did not know Blake's other work and some of his other opinions." In the later poems, however, Blake seems more intent on developing his own mythol ogy rather than attending very carefully to the implications of Gray's poetry. The author clearly knows Blake's visionary think ing and gives a number of very valuable explanations of his illustrations. But there are a number of unexamined difficulties in relating illustrations to text that sooner or later will require examination. To what ex tent do Gray's meters give meaning to his poetry and to what extent do Blake's il lustrations take account of this or ignore it? If, in dealing with Blake's illustrations, one must know the visionary cast of his mind, is it not equally necessary to know Gray's cast of mind in dealing with the poetry? Without such study, how does one discover the consistency of the illustrations with the meaning of the poems? What are the criteria by which one extrapolates "the suggestions of a poet's language"? One of the most surprising features of the illustra tions is the fact that they so clearly over whelm the small rectangles containing the poetic lines. Does this procedure indicate the subordination of poem to illustration? Do the illustrations attend only to content or is there some way in which they take account of syntactical and stylistic features? These questions are meant to advance the discussions in the text, not to minimize their value. The book offers helpful interpreta tions of Blake and raises important questions about how a poem is invested with non verbal meaning. Princeton $25 The Disme?nberment of Orpheus, by Ihab Hassan. In this almost morbidly sensitive study, Ihab Hassan, our chief critical apostle of Nothingness, continues his definitive ex plorations of what he variously names "post modern literature," "aliterature," or "the literature of silence." He is concerned in particular with the legacy of de Sade, with a literature that is disgusted by life and at tempts to destroy all "reality" (including itself) in order to attain non-sentience. De pressing as it may be, his demonstration of the moral energy behind this (primarily) European movement toward a catatonic silence is both convincing and helpful; it extends its clarifications far beyond the major figures (Hemingway, Kafka, Genet, Beckett) he chooses for explication. One can quarrel with Hassan's stylistic response to his material; his prose is courageous and suggestive, but traps itself in verbal silliness and occasional sentimentalisms. His study, however, does aspire to its own art, and he has achieved, finally, a remarkably compas sionate diagnosis of a particularly frighten ing way of thought. Oxford $8.50 Flaubert and Joyce: The Rite of Fiction, by Richard K. Cross. This is an excellent study of the literary debt of one great writer to another. Block, Hayman, Kenner, and others have written on individual aspects of the subject; now Cross has explored it in depth. He writes gracefully and convincingly, avoiding the temptation to "prove" literary influence. The most interesting chapters contain com parisons of "L'Éducation sentimentale" with "A Portrait," "La Tentation de saint An toine" with "Circe," and "Bouvard et Pécu chet" with "Ithaca." Occasionally one finds critical excursions that fail to shed much light on the topic at hand, but such digres sions are usually stimulating. On the whole this is a fine example of comparative criti cism. Princeton $6.50 clxviii</page><page sequence="5">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS Mallarmé and the Language of Mysticism, by Thomas Williams. Succinctness and clarity of presentation make this essay a particularly effective dis cussion of the problem of mysticism in Mallarmé's life and work. Mr. Williams refers only to those pertinent aspects in Mallarmé's experience that relate to mysti cism and its discernible expression in the major prose and poetry of this celebrated practitioner of Symbolism. After carefully establishing Mallarmé's mystical experience within the historical context of Western civilization, Professor Williams draws par allels between Mallarmé and Baudelaire, Rimbaud, and Valéry. Even though he seeks to prove primarily that Mallarmé's experience informed his poetry with a clearly emerging pattern, Williams' detailed explications of "L'Après-midi d'un faune," "Hérodiade," and "Un Coup de dés" relate the poet's expression most felicitously to the broader context of modernism. This essay is particularly recommended to the general reader. Georgia $; The Writings of J. M. Synge, by Robin Skelton. The year 1971 is the centennial anni versary of the birth of J. M. Synge, and it is thus appropriate that the first full-length, authoritative critical study of all his works should appear in print. It will remain one of the two essential books on Synge for many years to come, because it corrects previous scholarship, shows the relationship of unpublished works to the plays, and, in general, draws critical support from the manuscripts. Happily enough, Skelton also shows via his organization and economical prose style that authority need not mean pedantry. This book will make a most use ful companion to the four volumes of Col lected Works published during the last decade. Bobbs-Merrill $8 The Techniques of Strangeness in Sym bolist Poetry, by James L. Kugel. Insomuch as this approach to Symbolism avoids the complications of situating and defining the movement chronologically and developmentally, it succeeds admirably in underscoring the survival of various Sym bolist methods and attitudes in our own day. Mr. Kugel's wide readings in com parative Symbolism allow him to study its poetic expression from an international point of view. His explications of Nerval, Rimbaud, Mallarmé, Brjusov, Blok, Wallace Stevens, and Hart Crane—to mention but the most prominent poets—survey rather comprehensively the rhetorical and struc tural devices utilized by its most conscious practitioners. Chapter One, "What Is Sym bolism?," is a remarkably fresh approach to a complicated problem. The great virtue of Mr. Kugel's style is that it is unobtrusively scholarly without being overbearingly pedantic. All but the texts in French are translated into English. Yale $5.75 Defoe and Casuistry, by G. A. Starr. In this important study Professor Starr carries on the work begun in his "Defoe and Spiritual Autobiography" and seeks to illuminate Defoe's very problematical novels by reference to the religious tradition with which he was familiar. The first chapter examines the nature of casuistry as under stood by Defoe and his contemporaries: the consideration of specific circumstances when applying moral principles to particu lar cases. The remainder of the book takes up in turn "A Journal of the Plague Year," "Colonel Jack," "Moll Flanders" and "Rox ana," showing that the characters them selves analyze their experience in casuistical ways, and that this helps to account for the sympathy we feel with characters whose actions we can scarcely admire. Professor Starr takes his stand against the prevalent view of Defoe as a master ironist, and urges instead that his fascination with his characters' self-defense reflects "an extra ordinary empathy between author and character, amounting to a virtual oblitera tion of any distinct authorial presence." Since Defoe as casuist can conceive of a diversity of norms by which the characters may be judged, the norms become hypoth eses rather than absolutes; we compre hend each individual's plight too well to judge his behavior with much severity. If at times the analysis goes rather far beyond the subject of casuistry in its technical sense, the book is so much the richer for that: it is an impressive attempt to interpret historical materials in such a way as to clxix</page><page sequence="6">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS contribute directly to modern critical understanding. Princeton $7.50 Shakespeare and the Greek Romance, by Carol Gesner. Shakespeare's works, we know, were influenced by the romance, that forerunner of the modern novel where the most in dispensable feature of romantic fiction, the heroine, first emerges. But there has been a need to demonstrate how wide and per vasive such an influence has been; this need Miss Gesner's "Study of Origins" answers. As she points out, the derived tradition is present in the early plays, but it is in the last four plays that Shakespeare best utilizes the ancient genre and lifts "a rather in consequential literature of escape to a new vision of reality." Kentucky $7 The Friar as Critic: Literary Attitudes in the Later Middle Ages, by Judson Boyce Allen. This is a careful and scholarly investiga tion of a relatively untouched aspect of medieval literary history, the critical tech niques and assumptions of a small group of early fourteenth-century English friars who incorporated a great deal of classical ma terial into their lectures and sermons. Pro fessor Allen's findings bring powerful new evidence in support of modern historical scholars who have seen a radical disjunction between medieval and modern literary re sponses and who have urged the study of medieval scriptural exegesis as a source of both theoretical and practical models for reading medieval literature. Working per force from unpublished manuscript ma terials, Mr. Allen has produced new ex amples and material on the friar's attitudes toward the classics, but perhaps the best thing about the book is the sane, tactful discussion of how medieval allegory was and should be read. Much of what he has to say on that head is not particularly origi nal, but it is balanced and persuasive. Vanderbilt $11.50 Arthurian Propaganda. Le Morte Darthur as an Historical Ideal of Life, by Elizabeth T. Pochoda. As Professor Pochoda sees it, the im portant themes of "Le Morte Darthur" are clustered around the political problem of a government's obligation to mediate "be tween its public responsibilities to the com mon good and the private interests of its members." Originally, she argues, Malory must have planned his history of Arthur as an exemplification of certain large politi cal ideas, ideas deriving from the concept of "the king's two bodies." However, unlike earlier romancers of the twelfth and thir teenth centuries, Malory came to realize the incompatibility of the ideal and the history of Arthur's court. His romantic tragedy is the chronicle of the inevitable collapse of an imperfect, though beautiful, chivalric ideal. In the simplest terms, Ar thurian society collapses because Arthur fails to define the body politic broadly enough to escape the consequences of pri vate hatred and vice, and his kingdom falls in anarchy and civil strife. The thesis is attractive, and there are a number of useful insights produced in the unraveling of it, but a distressing residue of the text remains unexplained. North Carolina #7.50 Black Literature in America, edited by Houston A. Baker, Jr. To borrow the words of James Weldon Johnson's classic Black preacher, this valu able anthology attempts to "explain the unexplainable—find out the undefinable— ponder over the imponderable—and un screw the inscrutable." More than a collec tion, Professor Baker's volume is an exercise in definition. Read sympathetically, it in terprets convincingly the nature and de velopment of its literature; it illuminates the rage, and the pain, and the ultimate warmth of that hammering, stuttering pulse which is still only dimly felt beneath the thick white skin of our national conscious ness. It is refreshing to find an anthologist who feels no need to bow to the ceremonial presence of the Phyllis Wheatleys and Jupi ter Hammons, and who by rediscovering instead an informing folk culture is able to evoke a feeling for the integrity and power of Black literature that the usual collection of miscellanies must leave unde fined. In other words, Professor Baker knows precisely what he wants to say, and, whether or not one agrees with him, his clear orientation makes this surely the most useful Black anthology now available. McGraw-Hill $4.9; clxxii</page><page sequence="7">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS Chinese Lyricism, by Burton Watson. The dimensions of classical Chinese poetry, hitherto accessible mainly to schol ars (and to relatively few of these), are rapidly being made clear, through skilled translation and commentary (such as this), to the English-speaking world. Professor Watson confines his attention to the shih poetry from the second to the twelfth cen turies; but one comes away from this small volume with an extremely vivid impression of the lyrical quality of, for example, "High T'ang" poetry: I would like to punish the Creator; my wish would be to cut away these piled up peaks! Columbia $9 LIVES &amp; LETTERS The Mathers. Three Generations of Puritan Intellectuals, 1596-1728, by Robert Middle kauf. This analytical effort at an intellectual history of New England Puritanism has the particular merit of focusing on three generations of a distinguished ministerial family. Professor Middlekauf has treated his subjects, Richard, Increase, and Cotton Mather, with a sympathetic understanding of their thought and their times. Hence his intellectual history tends to be more intelligible than the comparable writings of Perry Miller. Indeed, in the context of the latter's writings, this volume is mildly re visionist. Although Middlekauf does not significantly alter prevailing interpretations of New England colonial intellectual his tory, he is able to demonstrate that the Mathers never ceased trying to fulfill their ministerial functions, despite the emerging lay culture that surrounded them. Oxford $12.50 Between Actor and Critic, edited by Daniel J. Watermeier. Edwin Booth, the actor, sent many let ters to William Winter, the critic, of which some 125 are here published. Very few of the Winter letters have survived, so that this would have been a very one-sided book if it were not for the editing of Mr. Water meier. He, however, has so fully explained the circumstances of each letter that both sides of this friendship are fully understood. Booth, who seems to have been a small man of romantic temperament, was such an un deniably important figure in the history of the American theater that this personal portrait is most welcome. Princeton $10 The Circle of Henry Adams: Art &amp; Artists, by Ernst Scheyer. The "circle" refers to Adams' friends and intellectual companions in the visual arts: John La Farge, painter, who taught Adams the importance of color; Augustus St-Gaudens, sculptor, whose monument for Mrs. Adams became instantly an American classic; and Henry Hobson Richardson, who designed Adams' Washington resi dence. Together, they "pretty much con trolled official American art around the turn of the century." Adams knew and re spected them before their reputations were made, hence Scheyer, a seasoned art his torian, achieves considerable interest in re lating him to their individual growth and development, after an illuminating section on Adams' own slightly unusual (and some times avant-garde) perceptions as a studious tourist and dilettante collector. A significant chapter in American art history, this study of relationship needed to be written—and unfortunately the need remains. For despite twenty years intermittent preoccupation with his subject, Scheyer has-not consulted valuable unpublished letters, even those of Adams readily available on microfilm. Re cent well-researched articles by Robert Mane (on Adams in France) and Marc Friedlaender (the Richardson-Adams col laboration) suggest what lies in resources Scheyer has ignored. But if not definitive, what he does give us is a useful and clearly organized introductory survey. Wayne State $8.95 A Genteel Endeavor: American Culture and Politics in the Gilded Age, by John Tomsich. The subtitle is too broad, as Mr. Tomsich admits, since his fine study touches merely in passing such major figures as James, Clemens, Hay, Adams, Howells, and Godkin. Who then is left? Quite sim ply, eight men who "occupied center stage in American culture" between 1865 and clxceiii</page><page sequence="8">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS 1914, men whose careers in writing and editing shaped "the golden age of Ameri can magazines," who wore a fapade of pub lic optimism which concealed a private pessimism as they tried to preserve the values of the John Quincy Adams era, an age of unified culture. Agnostic in religion, naïve in politics, worshipful of poetry por traying other times and climes, they de spised and feared the audience they served, worried about non-Nordic immigration, and—their greatest failure—dedicated them selves to manners and taste instead of build ing a workable philosophical framework to deal with an age of science and national transition. Lucid, forthright, and convinc ing (though some of his generalizations will assuredly invite scholars to do their own work with these forgotten men), Tomsich has done a superb job in portraying men of the media who stood wringing their hands as America careened past: Aldrich, Stod dard, Norton, Stedman, Taylor, Boker, Gilder, and Curtis. His reliance on crucial unpublished material shows the fascinating difference between private thinking and public expression—the Boker archives, for example, containing comment on not only oral-genital but aural-genital sex, which is (no double meaning intended) not exactly the face these men put forth in public. Stanford $8.50 The Complete Dublin Diary of Stanislaus Joyce, edited by George H. Healey. Originally published in 1962 in a some what censored version (to protect the feel ings of a few long-lived Dublin cronies), the "Complete Diary" records Stan's im pressions of the years 1903-1905, which saw his brother James's elopement (and exile) to the Continent, the death of their mother, the continued alcoholic disinte gration of their father, and the almost daily crisis of starvation and strife in the Joyce household. The book says nothing strikingly new or original about James or his circle, but it is a strong corrective to the prevalent view of Stan as aspiring lackey, doomed to stumble heavily along in the shadow of his brother's genius. Stan's diary is well worth reading for what it tells us about the strug gles of an eighteen to twenty year old youth against incessant loneliness, gloom, and adversity. What eventually pulls him through is his great determination, his unbending sense of integrity and his secret belief that in literary criticism, at least, he was his brother's superior. Stan will doubt less be best remembered as his brother's keeper, or the antagonist Shaun in "Fin negans Wake," and his epigrammatic style certainly recalls that of James Duffy in "A Painful Case," but his autobiographical works reveal that he merits a better niche in literary history. Cornell $6 J. M. Synge and His World, by Robin Skelton. This is a pictorial biography which brings together pictures relevant to Svnge's life. Some of the photographs are new, others were previously known only to scholars; all are tied together chronologically with just enough biographical commentary so that the book is informative without being overwhelming. Books in the Studio series are primarily designed for pleasure reading, but if expertly done, they can whet the appetite for the author's works through a photographic recreation of his world. Skel ton, probably the foremost scholar of Synge at present, has succeeded in doing this, though at times one wonders whether any interesting rustic scene in the Ireland of seventy years ago might not have merited consideration as part of Synge's "world." Viking $7.95 Jacob Tonson: Kit-Cat Publisher, by Kathleen M. Lynch. Jacob Tonson, late seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century publisher of Dryden, Pope, and other members of the Whig Kit-Cat Club, has been the subject of two recent biographies. The first claimed to con centrate on Tonson's publishing; this, the second, purports to review Tonson's multi faceted career as publisher, sometime politi cian, and man of letters. However, the* book falls short of its goal. Tonson's publishing career is in the forefront in each chapter. On occasion the author seems to be more desirous of writing about other members of the Kit-Cat Club than about Tonson him self. Much attention, for example, is given to Matthew Prior. In spite of the recent biographical studies of Tonson, a solid, full scale biography of the eminent publisher remains to be written. Tennessee $9.7$ clxociv</page><page sequence="9">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS Thief-Taker General: The Rise and Fall of Jonathan Wild, by Gerald Howson. Near the close of his book, Mr. Howson laments that Jonathan Wild, because of cir cumstances surrounding his trial and execu tion, became an obscure "villain symbol" rather than a real person in English history. Unfortunately a difficult prose style leaves Wild obscure, but perhaps that is just as well, because underlying the stated purpose of the book—a biography of Jonathan Wild —is a more significant exploration. Howson has read deeply in primary sources and gives the reader a look at English crime (and crime-control since the two were synonomous in the person of Jonathan Wild) in the early eighteenth century. Before Peel's Police of the 1820's, crime control was a private and often lucrative business, and the more thieves one "took" (i.e. reported) the more complete a monop oly he had for his own thievery. Between 1716 and 24 May 1724, Jonathan Wild managed a quite profitable portion of the London underworld and this biography suggests the character not only of Wild but also of that underworld. St. Martin's $8.95 Gibbon and His Roman Empire, by David P. Jordan. This book developed out of the author's doctoral dissertation, ordinarily an unprom ising point of departure, but it is eminently readable withal, and it casts a great deal of very significant light upon the famous Gibbon and the influences which operated upon him as he composed his massive "De cline and Fall of the Roman Empire." The structure, the author admits, is diffuse, in that each chapter focuses on a single prob lem or aspect of Gibbon's work, and there is not much connection between them. The first chapter, for example, is biograph ical, the second deals with Gibbon's schol arship, the third with his relationship with "the Enlightenment," the fourth with his "Jansenist mentors," the fifth with the earlier historians whom he particularly admired, and so forth. The theme of the book is Gibbon, the historian, not the his tory which he wrote, but the final chapter none the less is valuable for the synthesis it gives of the anatomy of decline and fall clxxvi as conceived by Gibbon. The reader of Gibbon would be fortunate, indeed, if he had had the chance to read Jordan first. Illinois $8.95 HISTORY The Jeffersonian Crisis: Courts and Politics in the Young Republic, by Richard E. Ellis. Richard E. Ellis has written a major work on the Jeffersonian period in American his tory. Centering upon the Jeffersonian Federalist dispute over the nature of the national judiciary, Ellis demonstrates that this conflict was part of the original con stitutional struggle commencing in 1776. The Jeffersonian victory was the triumph of the moderate Republican wing coming together with the moderate Federalist wing to insure the survival of republican princi ples. This work brilliantly demonstrates that the conflict over the Federal judiciary was not simply a dispute over partisan in terests, but goes to the very roots of defin ing the purposes for which the regime existed. This is, indeed, a major contribu tion. Oxford $9.75 Laboratory for Liberty: The South Carolina Legislative Cmnmittee System, 1719-1776, by George Edward Frakes. American colonial historians have often looked at the lower legislative bodies of the colonial assemblies as the source of much of the agitation and discontent that even tually produced the American Revolution. Mr. Frakes has moved one step beyond and has thoroughly dissected one colony's lower house into its legislative committees. He suggests that throughout the period of royal government in South Carolina, the com mittees of the lower house gradually took control of such important matters as Indian affairs, military preparations against both Spaniards and Indians, and the "purse strings." The committees' work trained co lonial and revolutionary leaders such as Christopher Gadsden, Charles Pinckney, and Henry Laurens and, furthermore, that work gave the committees a position of control that they refused to relinquish when the British royal governors tried to reassert power after 1765. Mr. Frakes' thesis is straightforward and convincing.

Kentucky $12.50 The Negro in Texas, 1874-1900, by Law rence D. Rice. Clearly within the pattern of revisionism pioneered by C. Vann Woodward in his "Origins of the New South," Lawrence Rice's contribution to that scholarship is certainly a positive one. On the crucial question of the origins of Jim Crow, Rice demonstrates that while legal Jim Crowism did not arrive until near the end of the nineteenth century, more subtle forms of Jim Crow began with emancipation. Al though the bulk of the book is concerned with the Negro's rôle in Texas politics, those chapters treating social progress, agriculture, and Negro life are perhaps the stronger portion of the work. Marring this otherwise good contribution to scholarship is the absence of any maps showing voting patterns, populations, and so forth that are so necessary to the understanding of a local study of this nature. Louisiana $10 Pride's Purge: Politics in the Puritan Revo lution, by David Underdown. The title of this book might be better reversed. Although Pride's Purge of De cember, 1648, is the central event of the book, the very complex politics of the Puritan Revolution are the real subject. In exploring those politics, Underdown sheds light on the entire English Civil War and Interregnum. With impressive detail, oc casionally a bit tedious, the author has pointed out that Purgers and Puritans had little unity in their overall governmental program and that consequently their rule after Pride's Purge was little more effective than the rule of others before. Although the author explores the motivation of Puritans and Purgers through a statistical analysis of the Members of Parliament of the 1640's, he is wisely cautious in his con clusions. On the whole, the book reads well, is well documented, and is a positive contribution to the impressive body of scholarly literature on the period of the English Civil Wars. Oxford $15.2; The Parliament of 1624: Politics and For eign Policy, by Robert Ruigh. The Parliament of 1624 was of crucial importance to seventeenth-century England. Under the influence and intrigue of Buck ingham and Prince Charles, this Parliament tried to assert itself more permanently in foreign affairs and thus helped to establish precedents that would later prove dangerous to King Charles. Parliament was influential in moderating James I's course in Spain and in the Palatinate. With impressive detail, both in narrative and footnote, Robert Ruigh has traced this Parliament through its organization, through the system of pa tronage employed by king, prince, royal favorite, and Parliamentarians. Although the work occasionally suffers from too much detail and a consequently difficult prose, it has a much-needed focus on a single year and single parliament that will be of use to scholars of Jacobean England. Harvard $15 The Character of the Good Ruler. A Study of Puritan Political Ideas in New England, 1630-1730, by T. H. Breen. As part of a continuing effort by histo rians to elucidate the transformation of colonial New England in the century after settlement, Timothy Breen has studied Puri tan political ideas, and in particular the changing notions of the good ruler. He argues that the Glorious Revolution was the crucial event in the transformation of Puritan ideas about civil leadership from a primarily spiritual emphasis to a more secu lar focus under the banner of the protection of liberty and property. His treatment of the Glorious Revolution is the most original chapter in a book distinguished more by a detailed and balanced treatment of events and issues than by the originality of its gen eral themes or its conceptual breakthroughs. Breen's application of the concept of sepa rate Court and Country approaches to basic issues in New England politics in the early eighteenth century is, however, very pro vocative. Yale $10 Sisters of Liberty: Marseille, Lyon, Paris, and the Reaction to a Centralized State, 1868-1871, by Louis M. Greenberg. If Paris is not all France, as visitors are clxxvii</page><page sequence="11">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS sagely advised, it is nevertheless true that all France is in Paris. Few nations are more centralized; go anywhere in France and find schoolchildren studying the same book at the same hour, clerks filing the same forms, Frenchmen operating their businesses and their lives under one and the same code. Napoleon is frequently blamed (or praised) for this, but in reality much of the modern foundation of the centralized state was laid under his nephew (Louis Bonaparte) and in the Third Republic. This excellent book describes the struggle over the organiza tion of France in a crucial period. Harvard $12 The German Dictatorship: The Origins, Structure, and Effects of National Socialism, by Karl Dietrich Bracher. Written for the interested layman and the serious scholar, this is a book of great worth. Karl Dietrich Bracher, who wrote a masterful study of the disintegration of the Weimar Republic and edited the classic vol ume on the Nazi party and the seizure of power, has now extended the great range of his knowledge to cover the history of National Socialism from its sources in Ger man history, through the nightmare of the Third Reich, to its extinction in World War II. Bracher impressively combines his torical and political analyses with an au thority few can match. He presents no popular monocausal explanation of this chapter in the history of the "unquiet Ger mans" but examines realistically the com plexities of the origin, development, and dénouement of Hitler's totalitarian régime. His separation and identification of diverse strands and processes and their weaving together to show the fabric of National So cialism proceeds from the ideological pre conditions through the origins of the move ment, the "era of Struggle," the shaping of the Nazi state, Hitler's foreign policy, the development of resistance, the system in wartime, the collapse of the régime, and the weight of this political inheritance. All are examined, treated, and weighed with scru pulous regard for objective truth. In Ger many's political life since 1945 Bracher sees a considerable continuity of National Social ism, and these manifestations are described and evaluated. His notable work ends on a cautious but hopeful note: "The German dictatorship has failed but German democ racy has not yet been secured. Securing it remains a task that demands full aware ness that the road to a real and realistic democratization is a narrow one, still strewn with many obstacles." The translation is faultless and Peter Gay has contributed a thoughtful preface. Praeger $13.95 Yalta, by Diane Shaver Clemens. Professor Clemens, an MIT historian, has produced an astonishingly readable and un biased study of the Yalta Conference of February, 1945. She scrupulously avoids imposing her own views on the discussions and debates among Stalin, Roosevelt, and Churchill, focusing instead on the partici pants' respective strategies and tactics at the conference table. Since the outcome of that bargaining process had such profound im plications for the postwar world, and since Professor Clemens has utilized a rich variety of sources (including Soviet archival ma terials) in an intelligent manner—devoid of polemics—the book can be recommended unreservedly for anyone with an interest in public affairs. Oxford $8.50 Civil War in South Russia, 1918, by Peter Kenez. No one disputes, at least not publicly, General Sherman's observation that "war is hell," but there ought to be some special category for civil war, which is surely the horror of horrors. Peter Kenez demonstrates in this scholarly account that, as bad as the 1914-1917 war was on the Eastern Front, the civil war that followed it was worse. In that great melting pot of nations which makes America seem neatly homogeneous, the violence of centuries culminated in the apocalyptic events of 1918-1921. Ethnic ac counts were settled by the gross; political conflicts saw anarchists, Communists, demo crats, and conservatives in one of the great conflicts of the century. California $10 Land Beyond the Rivers: The Southern Sudan, 1898-1918, by Robert O. Collins.

It is the latest of three volumes in which the author has traced the hitherto little-studied impact of pre-World War I European rivalries, French, Belgian, British, upon this latest known, long most inaccessible major region of Darkest Africa, the tropical plains and swamplands surrounding the rivers that feed the White Nile. The efforts of the Belgians and the ultimately triumphant British to penetrate this remote land, the tremendous struggle necessary to clear the rivers of the sudd, or huge tangled masses of vegeta tion that blocked the indispensable river highways, the hardly less intricate sinuosi ties of the diplomatic moves and expeditions based upon King Leopold's Congo and the British-controlled Northern Sudan (the so called Anglo-Egyptian Condominium), are all described in detail; and extended treat ment is given the attempts by British civil servants and Christian missionaries to im pose their type of order, administration, and culture upon the tribes. It is some measure of their failure here that Still today the Nuer, Dinka, Azande, and other peoples of the south continue fiercely to resist a Khar toum army that with Russian aid seeks to substitute an alien civilization for their ancient traditions and cherished independ ence. Yale $12.50 Co?mnunism and Nationalism in India, by John Patrick Haithcox. This study traces the development of Communism and socialism in India from 1920 to 1939. It focuses on the political philosophy and activities of M. N. Roy, the founder of the Communist Party of India. Much of the material explored—e.g., the Roy-Lenin debate on colonial policy at the Second Comintern Congress and Roy's ac tivities in China—are familiar. But Haith cox's analysis and interpretations are un conventional enough to be refreshing and illuminating. In addition, he has made use of new materials obtained through inter views with Indian Royists and through the Roy Archives in India. While the book is splendidly researched and clearly written, it suffers from a major shortcoming—the author's undisguised and often effusively expressed admiration for Roy. Haithcox, like many other biographers, unfortunately succumbs to the temptation to idealize his subject. Nonetheless, he does provide us with a clear picture of an important figure operating at an important time in the devel opment of the world Communist movement. Princeton $12.50 Communist China, 1949-1969, edited by Frank N. Trager and William Henderson. This book consists of fourteen articles surveying and analyzing the first two dec ades of Communist rule in China. All ma jor sectors of Chinese life are examined— foreign policy, politics, ideology, military affairs, culture, education, economics, and agriculture. Contributors include some of the most prominent China specialists in the Western world. Their contributions are of uneven quality: some represent original and creative research, while others bring to gether the findings of other experts. Most, however, are careful and authoritative, and the volume as a whole is a welcome addi tion to the growing literature on Com munist China. As American contacts with China expand, it will become increasingly important for American citizens to become informed about the People's Republic. This book is a good place to begin. New York $1.95 Mao Papers, edited by Jerome Ch'en. Jerome Ch'en, a British historian, has compiled and translated a number of Mao Tse-tung's unpublished writings. Together with several already published but relatively unknown selections—commemorative writ ings, letters, talks, and formal instructions— these provide an interesting footnote to what we know about "The Great Helms man." More useful, both to scholars and students, are a chronological bibliography (in both English and Chinese) of Mao's writings and an essay on Mao's literary style. The latter, only twenty pages in length, sheds considerable light not only on Mao, but on Communist censorship prac tices as well. It deserves a wider audience than this highly specialized volume is likely to reach. Oxford $10 Self-Determination and History in the Third World, by David C. Gordon. Gordon writes as though colonialism were clxxooi</page><page sequence="13">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS a phenomenon of the past. His prime con cern is that the historians of the Third World dedicate themselves to an histori ography stressing the eighteenth-century ideals of ecumenicalism and universality. The work provides useful insights, how ever, on the attitudes adopted by historians of recently liberated countries, and its dis cussions often cast the Third World in a light seldom seen in contemporary jour nalism and periodicals. An awareness of the current polarity of the world in terms of nuclear power and contemporary expan sionism by the West seems lacking, but the genuine insights and timely cautions are worth attention. Princeton $7.50 Personality in Japanese History, edited by Albert M. Craig and Donald H. Shively. This collection of essays by some four teen contributors hardly bears out the edi tors' contention, that the study of personal ity will prove essential to the understanding of Japanese history. The difficulty is the familiar one, that personality, per se, is not a dimension that can (in spite of alleged psycho-sociological techniques) adequately be assessed. That the study of personal documents will prove suggestive, few will be prepared to deny; but that "personality" can accurately be determined from existing residues would appear most unlikely. Some of these essays—e.g., "Akutagawa Ryüno suke and the Negative Ideal"—are, never theless, of considerable intrinsic interest. California $8.75 Imperial Restoration in Medieval Japan, by H. Paul Varley. To most casual students of Japanese his tory, the term "restoration" means univ ocally the accession of the Emperor Meiji in 1868. But there was a much earlier at tempt to restore the Imperial power to its "proper" locus. Oddly enough, this four teenth-century restoration had repercus sions in 1945 when General Mac Arthur received a letter from one Kumazawa Kandö, who claimed to be the rightful ruler of Japan. Professor Varley's book is a thoroughly readable account of this little known aspect of Japanese history. Columbia $8 Chronicle from Aldgate: Life and Death in Shakespeare's London, by Thomas Rogers Forbes. This book is a demographic account of birth, sickness, and death in the parish of St. Botolph without Aldgate from 1583 to 1625. The web of days spun here—the chronicle of natality and mortality—pro vides a fascinating insight into the life of London's laboring population. Mr. Forbes has utilized the parish records to good effect as he shows us how the threads of poverty, disease, and dependence run through the parishioners' lives. But the study lacks a clear focus, and its title, unfortunately, re flects too well the nature of the narrative. Almost episodic in character, the book often leaves the reader lost in a welter of detail. Nonetheless, the study offers a specifically urban dimension to the growing number of studies in English historical demography. Yale $10 GENERAL The Ordering of the Arts in Eighteenth Century England, by Lawrence Lipking. This is an ambitious book that sets out to study "those works which attempted for the first time to describe the whole practice of a single art." Lipking selects works on paint ing, music and poetry, calling attention to the contributions of Jonathan Richardson, Charles Burney, Horace Walpole, Thomas Warton, and Samuel Johnson. "The Order ing of the Arts" indicates that there was relatively little ordering done in the cen tury, and Lipking is not especially inter ested in discussing abstract ideas of order or history in the period. His book is reliable, informative, and useful in dealing with specific works that have received little study. He adds to our knowledge of the his tory of the arts, but he agrees with earlier critics that the works, with the exception of Johnson's "Lives of the Poets," leave much to be desired as criticism and history. Princeton $12.50 Thomas Jefferson Redivivus. Photographs by loseph C. Färber and text by Wendell D. Garrett. When so much original pictorial material clœxxiv</page><page sequence="14">Distinguished New Titles from Tennessee exists to illustrate the life of Thomas Jef ferson, it speaks trenchantly for the power of the camera that a book such as this should use present-day photographs and that the name of the photographer precedes the name of the author. The photographs are indeed most interesting, imaginative, and comprehensive, but there is no hint that their sites might have changed in the years since Jefferson knew them. The text, then, becomes the hub of the book and, since it was largely by what the dust jacket calls "the man himself," can hardly be faulted. The excerpts are connected with explanatory passages which smooth the read er's path into an easy sense of comprehen sion. The book is a celebration of the man, but does not necessarily become an exposi tion of his life. Barre $25 Wyndham Lewis: Paintings and Drawings, by Walter Michel. Thanks to an enthusiastic author Wynd ham Lewis has finally come into his own after a very long period of neglect.

But to an old Lewis watcher the results were more than worth the difficulties and it is fine to see this homage on so large, even grandiose, a scale at last.

But one sup poses a touch of the missionary is neces sary when propagandizing for Lewis, since he left so many enemies. California $35 The Horned Moses in Medieval Art and Thought, by Ruth Mellinkoff. Miss Mellinkoff tackles the old problem of the meaning of the horns which are so frequently seen on Moses. She finds, first, that the image is more recent than one would suppose (eleventh century, A. D.) though this image is based on a fourth century translation which is a deliberate mistake. She also finds that the horns have a different meaning at different times ranging from victory, strength, power, divinity, kingship, and salvation at the time of the translation to horns of light to the present day mark of dishonor (cuckoldry, et cetera) chcxxv</page><page sequence="15">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS and an actual omission on doctored images which originally bore them.

California $16.50 Boulez on Music Today, by Pierre Boulez; translated by Susan Bradshaw and Richard Rodney Bennett. This is a highly technical, and largely very personal, collection of studies, the last and most extensive of which is the com poser's analysis of serial compositional tech nique. The somewhat misleading title is ex plained by the fact that the world of music today has arisen, according to the author, "from the expansion of the idea of the se ries." Although any thoughts from one of the most significant figures on the current musical scene are interesting, this work, which probably suffers in the translation, is definitely for the initiated. Harvard $6.95 The Image Empire, by Erik Barnouw. "The Image Empire" is the completion of Barnouw's three-volume history of broad casting in the United States. This volume covers the events from the popularity of television through the MacCarthy hearings, quiz shows, the rise of documentaries like "See It Now," political images like Ken nedy's and the tragedy of November 22, 1963, to Apollo il. Through these events Barnouw emphasizes the growing political and business usage of the media, especially television commercially produced. He char acterizes the media as a 1984 object spread ing the one-dimensional thought of the military-industrial complex to an increas ingly passive receiving society. This well written and researched history of broad casting ultimately tells the tale of a case of mass mental lockjaw and predicts disastrous pathological consequences unless new meth ods are forced upon the broadcasting indus try. Oxford S9.75 The Urban Reader, edited by Susan Cahill and Michele F. Cooper. The sights and sounds packed between these two covers urge the reader to put on his boots and walk in the city. This book succeeds in recreating a deadly dramatic and stimulating city, where we catch fleet ing signs of urban possibilities and where we are pushed and pounded by facts too large for us. One of the themes is of insti tutions which no longer work but refuse to disappear—facts so depressing that they lead to the feeling, as in the popular song, that "We Gotta Get Out of This Place." But another theme speaks of compassionate alternatives—Richard Hatcher's inaugural speech at Gary, a proud Black Panther manifesto, an unsigned mural transforming a bleak alley wilderness into a garden. The verbal crosscurrents of city life and the visual images of city people evoke an em pathie response where usually only sym pathy is possible. Prentice-Hall $8.95 Bangkok, by Alec Waugh. It is difficult to see how anyone could write an «/«interesting account—Waugh calls it a "biography"—of the Bang of Kok. An ever-increasing number of American visitors delight in a tour of the klongs, in a visit to the Grand Palace, and in a stroll through the Lumpini Gardens. But there has been little general material available on the history of the City, which is virtually identical with a history of Thailand itself, at least in relatively modern times. There are some appalling gaps in Mr. Waugh's bibliography, but this is a book that anyone who plans to visit Bangkok should certainly read before setting out on his journey. Little, Brown $7.95 The Grundrisse of Karl Marx, edited by David McLellan. Anyone interested in modern politics, economics, or philosophy—particularly the development of Marxism—will be grateful to Professor McLellan for his translation of selections from one of Marx's most important manuscripts. "The Grundrisse" (1857-58), in part a preliminary draft of "Das Kapital," is at the same time an in dependent work. It is a rich source for un derstanding Marx's views on labor and alienation, a valuable supplement to the "Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844." Not surprisingly, much of the writing is difficult to comprehend; indeed, it is at times rather turgid and opaque.

Harper &amp; Row $5.95 The Taoist Vision, by William McNaugh ton. Of late, more and more attention is being paid to that far-eastern outlook known as "Taoism," and this latest small contribution has a good deal to recommend it. The point of departure is, of course, the (alleged) writings of Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu, por tions of which are here presented in Mr. McNaughton's own translation. In "Book Two," items from ancient Chinese and less ancient Japanese literature are set forth further to exemplify the Taoist theme, while finally, poems by William Carlos Wil liams, E. E. Cummings, and Lenore Mayhew represent an attempt to close the generation culture gap for contemporary readers. In less than 100 pages, this little paperback says quite a lot. Michigan $4.9y; paper $1.95 Psychological Reflections, by C. G. Jung. Edited by Jolande Jacobi and R. F. C. Hull. Jung has become rather less fashionable lately, what with the Freudian revival and the new insights of socio-psychology, but the sheer brilliance of his teachings con tinues to exercise great influence. This new anthology of quotations from his works covers the entire range of his career, includ ing the marvelously productive last decade and a half. The power inherent in Jung's thought is evident on every page, and it is expressed with a clarity that laymen will find astonishing Bollingen-Princeton $8.50 Every War Must End, by Fred Charles Ikle.

It explores the im portant, but seldom asked, question: How clxxocvii</page><page sequence="17">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS are wars brought to an end? Ilde explores the problems—psychological, military and political—which impede (or even prevent) efforts to terminate wars. His focus is ex clusively historical. Recognizing that we are still too close to the events in South east Asia, he deliberately refrains from referring to Vietnam. The result is an intel ligent, balanced, imaginative essay, social science at its best. At the same time, though, it is a cri de coeur from an involved and humane man, anxious to apply the lessons of history to resolving present or future con flicts at minimal cost. Columbia $8 Lenin's Grandchildren, by Kitty D. Weaver. This is a highly impressionistic study of preschool education in the Soviet Union, based on the author's observations and in terviews obtained during several visits to the USSR. Despite her lack of professional credentials—or perhaps because of this— Mrs. Weaver has written an eminently readable and illuminating book. There is none of the ponderousness of more pro fessional analyses, and she has skillfully described the institutions and techniques used to transform the Soviet preschooler into a New Soviet Man. Nonetheless, the very strength of her treatment is sometimes a liability, for she is a rather credulous ob server, sometimes accepting uncritically her Soviet hosts' statements and reporting them as facts. Still, her enthusiasm is an asset: she is perceptive and her treatment is basically sound. While scholars will ques tion her credentials, the representative ness of her interview sample, and certain of her statements, the book can be recom mended for any citizen interested in one of the major achievements—and one of the principal political control mechanisms—of the Soviet régime. Simon &amp; Schuster $7.50 The Wild Prayer of Longing, by Nathan A. Scott, Jr. In some ways this is an ecological book seeking to preserve the last vestigial remains of America's waning faith—in everything. "The Greening of America" offered hope in the form of consciousness three; for Scott it is the "sacramental imagination" that survives our atavistic longings for an anthropomorphic God and a two-storied universe. But Scott, as those who know his ten previous books can testify, is not one to employ verbal sleight of hand in approaching the modern dilemma, and in the first and last chapters he offers a thorough examination of the passing of the figurai and the birth of the sacramental imagination and of Theodore Roethke's poetry. Scott's thesis relies on Heidegger's ontology (of which there is too much sum mary) and stresses the meditative mode of perception in which the poet hails "that which is" as a gift (indeed, an attestation) of Being. As an analysis of modern Sehn sucht and a refuge of one of its solutions, the book offers a noteworthy attempt at the salvation of that which we are likely to consider most valuable—symbiosis, "Otherness" in a technological age. Yale $6.75 Stalking the Good Life, by Euell Gibbons. This new product of Mr. Gibbons' lively pen is printed (as is carefully noted in the dust-jacket) on recycled paper. Unfortu nately, many of the ideas and most of the data are recycled from the author's previ ous volumes, though his enormous gusto and enthusiasm carry him through where lesser deities would be apt to falter and stumble, especially while having a "love affair with nature," the subtitle of the book. Nevertheless, there are shrewd observa tions, lively anecdotes, and interesting factual materials which many "nature lovers" will delight to read. McKay $5.95 Two Islands, by Katharine Scherman. In these days of ecological imbalance, islands which have some claim to selfsuf ficiency and equilibrium conditions are apt to have an especial fascination for a sensi tive writer like Katharine Scherman. The two islands of which she writes both belong to the east coast of our continent, but pre sent a striking contrast. The northern one, Grand Manan, is wild and rocky with fre quent fogs and tremendous tides. The south ern one, Sanibel, is low-lying, sheltered, with a gentle climate and semi-tropical vegetation. Each has its long and intricate history, but in this book, each comes to have a definite personality. Little, Brown $l-9S clocxxviii</page></plain_text>
