The Archaeology of Early Chinese Religion Seattle-London, University of Washington Press, 2015. xiii + 297 pages, 80 illustrations en noir et blanc, 14 illustrations en couleurs, 1 carte, bibliographie, index. ISBN 978-0-295-99449-9 Excavating the Afterlife tells the fascinating story of a major transition in the way the ancient Chinese buried their dead, going from the vertical pit-tombs that prevailed from the Shang on to the horizontal burial chambers that became nigh universal by the Han, with the transition occur ring gradually over the entire Warring States period. Guolong Lai's thesis is that this change marked a massive shift in the way the dead were viewed, from religious source of politi cal power in the Shang and Zhou to "vengeful ghosts" who were feared: A new, previously undoc umented category of unquiet ghosts appears in the religious pantheon. These vengeful ghosts became a dominant spiritual force in Eastern Zhou and later religious life. This novel category of the dead initially included only aristocrats who suffered violent deaths during political struggles but subsequently grew to encompass conscripted commoners who died in war and other members of the general population. CP 29) Above all, Lai attempts an all-encompassing interpreta tion that explains a vast range of facts derived from both textual and archaeological sources: common burial of husband and wife in the same tomb, requiring a tomb which was accessible and could be reopened; "pervasive use of spirit artifacts (mingqi BJ3Ü?) to mark the severance of ties between the dead and the living; wider use of anthro pomorphic and hybrid images and written texts to commu nicate with the spirit world; formation of the underworld bureaucracy" (p. 12). If at first the "unquiet dead" were "those elite killed by their opponents in intralineal strug gle," in the Warring States, with the "démocratisation" of warfare, they came "to include conscripted commoners, sol diers, and generals" (p. 46). One example of the violence of the period given by Lai is the 400,000 soldiers of the state of Zhao who, after surrendering, were either killed or buried alive by the Qin army (p. 47). Quoting a famous passage attributed to Zichan in the Zuozhuan, Lai explains that, "When an ordinary man or woman dies a violent death, his or her hunpo are still able 189</page><page sequence="2">to possess [pingyi 憑依)some one in the form of a malevolent ghost [yinli 淫厲〕,,(p. 44〕. Lai's hypothesis is that, as "religious efficacy" shifted away from the politically powerful to feared ghosts, the living sought to separate themselves perma nently from the dead. Whereas the political elite had been buried in lineage cem eteries, with men and women having separate tombs, the emerging society was more one of families, with joint burial in the same Chamber: "This prac tice started among members of the middle and lower levels of Western Han society and gradually spread to the upper level of society as well" (p. 55). Sacrificial spaces were created in the tomb itself, and eventu ally suppressed in temples and homes. The now "home-like" space of the tomb that could be walked into "aimed at helping the deceased transform from potentially dangerous ghosts into benevolent ancestors" (p. 56). There was also an overall "shift in burial ideology from the hiding of the corpse in the Shang and Western Zhou periods to its luxurious public display in the Warring States period and the early empires" (p. 55〕. Among the grave goods, it was no longer the bronzes for use in sacrifice that dominated but "personal adornments and Utensils made of gold and silver, precious beads and jewels, expensive silk clothes, and lacquered vessels ofhigh qual ity" (p. 63〕. On lists placed in the tombs, many of these new items were classified as "travel paraphernalia" (p. 51). Lai describes in detail the six lists placed in différent 190 locations with correspond ing artifacts in the tomb of Shao Tuo, a high Chu official. According to the Yili, these lists were to be read out before the funeral procession when all grave goods and gifts were displayed. Standing on the east, facing the coffin on the west, "As the scribe reads the lists of gifts, the tallyman sits and tal lies the items. When this is fin ished, he orders the mourners to resume their wailing." They then shift to the west and face east: "The scribe then reads the lists of grave goods" (p. 142). In the Warring States, suggests Lai, these lists "changed from a bookkeeping device for sump tuary control to a symbolic, magico-religious instrument of substitution" (p. 144). This suggestion is based on the fact that not all the expensive items mentioned were in fact placed in the tomb—things like elabo rate chariots and weapons: From the fragmen tary evidence, it seems that funerary objects that signify the tomb occupant's social status were often just recorded or only partially buried in the tomb, while cus tomary everyday utensils for burial furnishings were not recorded at all. (p. 146) At first, only the high-rank ing elite had such lists, but by the Qin and Han, the lists were "mainly in tombs of people of lower social status" (p. 144) and corresponded to personal belongings not related to social standing. "Tombs that pro duced almanacs, manuals, and philosophical literature" came from the tombs of "lower-level state functionaries in the local government" (p. 144). In a tomb dated to 153 bce, the list of grave goods was "reported to the lord of the underworld." The list has been approved, it says, and "urges the underworld clerk to follow the statutes and proceed accordingly" [p. 147). Another text, from a tomb dated 142 bce, lists grave goods "that matched perfectly the figurines of humans and animals excavated from the tomb" (p. 148). A tomb dated 173 bce refers to the soul's destination as Andu, capital of peace, and requests that "the underworld bureaucrats accept her household and property registration": "The family exempted from taxation, no poll tax or labor tax" (p. 148). Such documents even have the deceased speaking in his or her own name, requesting trans fer of personal property and registration. The local official then transmits the document to another unit for execution, so that "the privileges that the rich enjoyed in this life were extended to the afterlife" (p. 150). As local kings and marquises "were not required to register their household and personal property with local officials" (p. 151), texts in their graves mention only the list of burial goods and reporting it to the official in charge of burial. A criminal, by contrast, had first to clear his name before he could register in the underworld. There was, thus, a whole range of legal documents "addressed to the underworld bureaucracy... [that] reflected the changing attitude toward the dead, who came to be seen as potentially dangerous beings in need of management in the underworld" (p. 154). Early tombs suggesting a house in the other world, like that of the Marquis Yi of Zeng, had doors or windows painted on the coffins, "indicating that the souls could move within the confines of the tomb space" (p. 74). This eventually became the tomb as microcosm "meant 'to separate [the dead] from the living and to secure them with a universe of their own'" (p. 80). This separation was also expressed by tomb guardians with outstretched arms to prevent evil influences from entering the tomb. The guardians in the Mawangdui tombs had deer antlers on their heads, and there was a space like "a stage set for feed ing the departed soul while entertaining it with music and dance" (p. 85). The next development, seen in a tomb dated 157 or 128 bce, is the stamped-earth access ramp. This ramp was much shorter than before, and led to a kind of ante-chamber where funeral rites were possibly performed before the doors were closed and the guardians put in place. The doors had the dimensions of real doors: "No longer merely symbolic, these are functional gateways to the inside of the tomb" (p. 88). After the tran sitional space for sacrifices, there was a second set of doors leading to the coffin chamber. The open sacrificial space, suggests Lai, was "to pacify the potentially dangerous deceased" [p. 90). By the late Western Han, middle and lower Arts Asiatiques Tome 71 - 2016</page><page sequence="3">class burials also had such a sacrificial space. Concludes Lai: "This accessibility of the sacri ficial space is the fundamental difference between vertical pit-style tombs and horizontal chamber-style tombs" (p. 97). Instead of placing bronzes in the tomb where the dead could "continue sacrificing to their own ancestors in order to maintain their social sta tus" (p. 60) and contribute thereby to "maintaining the social and political well-being of their descendants" (p. 61), the living were now sacrificing to the dangerous dead. This change "owes much to the new awareness of the frightening potential of individual ghosts" (p. 97) and "reflects increasing efforts to pacify the dead by creating accessible and hospi table spaces for the cult of the dead in tombs" (p. 190). Ambivalence toward the dead also led to the use of the "magic power of image making" to control and help the dead (p. 99). In the Shang and Zhou, human figures were always "the social other" (p. 103), while ancestors were represented by stone or wooden tablets. But now, increasingly, tomb figurines substituted for the humans previously sacrificed to accom pany the powerful dead. By the mid-Warring States, half of elite tombs had them and, by the end, almost all tombs, whether elite or commoner. A Leigudun inventory mentions 57 serv ants. Mawangdui figurines 8-12 centimeters in height "had the power to ward off or expel evil spirits" (p. 111). One of "the most significant artistic developments in early China" (p. 115), the first appear ances of figure painting, also occurred in the Warring States: Through their anthro pomorphic depiction, the deceased elite were now subject to the same control as other groups of the Shang and Western Zhou periods. This trans formation arose from the desire on the part of the bereaved to preserve in anthropomorphic form the social identities of the deceased so that they could transition smoothly from this world to the afterlife. Here the deceased were regarded as "other" and were feared, (p. 115) These paintings repre sent the tomb occupant on a spirit journey in the afterlife and thus pos sessed the magical power to assist and guide the deceased thru the limi nal stage to the afterlife, [p. 117) By the Eastern Han, "por traits of tomb occupants were directly carved or painted onto the walls of tombs or family shrines" (p. 122). Another well-known figure often understood as a tomb guardian because of its "bulg ing eyes, protruding tongue, and beastly zoomorphic or anthropomorphic face" (p. 123), Lai interprets instead as the fecundity god, whose iconog raphy he sees as evolving from an "abstract phallic symbol to a hybrid and anthropomorphic figure" (p. 122) with "fantastic Arts Asiatiques Tome 71 - 2016 antlers ... signifying the ulti mate male power" (p.125). They are thus not just apotropaic but also "a symbol of the régén ération oflife" (p.129). Lai also discusses the hybrid images on the Chu silk manuscript and on the Mawangdui diagram of a central figure flanked by the Duke of Thunder and the Master of Rain. This figure is painted red and has a zigzag antler on his head, big round eyes, black trousers, and, to the left of his head, the inscription, "The Grand One is about to travel" (p.131〕. Under his left armpit is the circled character for she, earth god. Where Li Ling sees in this image a bibingtu 避兵圖 (diagram to repel weapons), Lai sees the key in a rearrangement of the incantation on the right hand side of the image, which then reads: "The Incantation of the Grand One: Today so and-so is about [to travel] ... The GreatYu goes first. Red vapors and white vapors dare not to turn toward me. The hundred weapons dare not harm me ... Go straight, do not look back." (p. 131〕 The images, says Lai, "illustrate the farewell ritual during which an incantation is uttered before the supplicant begins a journey" (p.131). The deceased traveler is at once Taiyi, Yu, and the earth god: "The key religious concept here is 'spirit possession," (p. 132〕, with the traveler first doing the Pace of Yu, then inviting Taiyi, Yu, or the earth god to possess and so protect him. Lai then refers to an inventory list in Shao Tuo's tomb which includes "paraphernalia used for travel," among which a cap and two trousers that "resem ble the costume of the central figure on the Mawangdui diagram. In other words, what the Mawangdui silk diagram illustrates is a fully equipped traveler wearing a xie cap and two trousers and riding a fan tastic dragon" [p. 133). Death is thus "conceived as a journey, and the dead were equipped with the appropriate travel documents for use in the afterlife" (p. 147). One possible form is "an arduous journey to an imagined cosmic destina tion in the northwest of the universe" (p. 161). The vertical axis for Shang-Zhou ancestors, of descent and ascent, became an east-west horizontal one in the Warring States. Citing a Jiudian incantation about the lord of the war dead, that the latter dwell "at the edge of Mount Fu and in the wilds of Buzhou" (p. 163), Lai notes that in many texts Buzhou is "the nexus of the spirit world, the axis connecting the spirit and human realms, or the Gate to the Dark Capital [youdu zhi men) where spirits resided" (p. 164). He recalls the mythical battle in which Gonggong butted the pillar of heaven, snapping one of the cords which tied heaven to earth and resulting in the NW/ SE tilt of the world. As to why the war dead were "treated dif ferently and relocated to Mount Buzhou ... one can only specu late" that they were gathered in one place in order to control them (p. 165). Lai now situates the impor tance of post-mortem travel by comparing it with the travel 191</page><page sequence="4">of the living as seen in the daybooks, with their good and bad days for travel, their "magical rites to ensure a safe journey" [p. 167), and their sac rifices to local gods. The Soul Summons" poem in the Chuci urges the soul to come home because travel in the various directions is dangerous. The new artifacts in late Warring States elite tombs like that of Shao Tuo—combs, mirrors, belt hooks, musical instruments for personal entertainment, utensils for eating, drinking, and sleeping—were all listed in "paraphernalia for travel and may have "served as the paraphernalia to be used in a journey in the afterlife (p. 175). Likewise, the maps found in tombs from the third century bce may have served as "postmortem guides" for this afterlife journey (p. 174). The Yili, moreover, has a sacrifice to the spirits of the road done before setting out for burial. In sum, the idea of the tomb as "the 'happy home' of the dead" needs to be rethought; it is per haps more like "a way station or as a starting point" enroute to the underworld (p. 186). As should be fairly clear from the above account, Lai offers his reader an extraordi nary wealth of both facts and interpretations. It should also be clear that one interpreta tion predominates, indeed is relentlessly repeated, that the new burial style was insepa rable from anxiety about the unfortunate dead, the ligui Ä %. is the hypothesis plausible? That the bronze inscriptions of the Chunqiu period "reflect a decline in belief in the religious efficacy of ancestors" (p. 35) is certain, but that "religious effi cacy had shifted to a group of unquiet ghosts and the fecun dity god" (p. 32) is far less so. In his Conclusion, Lai suggests that hybrid images of the fecun dity god and the Grand One "captured the fearful attitude toward both the dead and the gods" (p. 190). Did they? What about all the hybrid gods in the Shanhaijing (p. 130)? Did they also inspire fear? And what have they to do with "unquiet ghosts?" Did not just some war dead but all the dead go to the northwest, as seems to be suggested in the discussion of lamps lighting the way for the dead enroute "to the northwest in darkness" (p. 177)? And does lighting the darkness qualify as "apotropaic?" Could attitudes toward the dead not combine both anxiety and a sense of closeness, even intimacy? As Lai himself says (p. 191), per sonal relationships, starting with that between husband and wife now buried together, did not end with death. One could argue that the irrevo cably closed Shang and Zhou tombs indicated greater fear of the dead than the reopenable tombs of the Han. While Lai does frequently state the provisional character of all interpretations of mute archaeological remains, there is a definite tendency toward monolithic explanation in terms of the unfortunate dead. In my view, this retrojects onto the Warring States/early impe rial periods characteristics of popular religion from a much later date. But above all, the very project of contrasting the politically powerful ancestors of the early with the dangerous 192 dead of the later period is ill advised: first, dynastie ances tors continue to have great power throughout Chinese imperial history, indeed even in the present day, as may be seen in the cuit of Mao Zedong. It is precisely because elite ances tors had power that "the rites did not go down to the people" 禮不下庶民 until the mid-Ming. Second, it is not because we have no witnesses to the power of ligui before the Zuozhuan that such dead—and fear of them—did not exist. Nonetheless, there is every reason to be grateful, both for the "synthetic account of early Chinese mortuary religion from an archaeological perspective" (p. 191) and for the attempt at comprehensive explanation.
