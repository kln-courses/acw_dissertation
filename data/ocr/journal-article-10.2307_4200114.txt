<plain_text><page sequence="1">23 A MIDDLE ASSYRIAN TABLET OF UTUKKU LEMNUTU, TABLET i2 By M. J. GELLER The Middle Assyrian Tablet BM 130660 adds new material to the latter part of Tablet 12 of Utukk? Lemn?tu, which is imperfectly known from ? A and LB sources, mainly from Kuyunjik and Assur.1 The gaps in the previous publications can now be restored from the MA tablet, together with unpublished duplicates from Kuyunjik, Babylon, Borsippa, and Nimrud.2 The bilingual MA tablet is of particular interest because, although in SB dialect, it differs substantially from the NA and LB copies of Tablet 12.3 Although many of the MA textual variants are purely orthographic, the following types of significant variants can be distinguished : First, grammatical variants in the MA Akk. may affect the meaning of a passage, such as the MA use of lipparis in place otliprus in the parallel texts (1. 26'). In some cases the MA grammatical variant may indicate a corrupt text, or a misunder- standing of the Sum., as in 1. 30', in which the MA Akk. reads, " may the wise judges, holy ones of I5tar(?), exclude him from the house ", whereas the NA/LB recension reads correctly, " may the great wise judge I?tar exclude him from the house ". A second type of MA variant consists of lexical variations, such as the MA use of al?ku for gin in 1. 28', instead of kal? for gin in parallel texts. Occasionally, the MA Akk. uses a rarely attested equivalent for the Sum., as in 1. 92', in which the MA text employs idmu for dim, instead of the more common equivalent band, found in another copy. In 1. 13', the MA text has dm for ku4.ku4, unattested elsewhere, while other copies have the common equivalent er?bu. In two instances, moreover, the MA Sum. contains rare or unattested equivalents of the Akk., as in d? for tar?su in 1. 12', or gi forpar?su in 1. 25', while ??/LB copies have the expected equivalents of la and tar respectively. I am deeply indebted to several people for their assistance. My most sincere thanks to Professor D. J. Wiseman, who drew my attention to the MA tablet, and especially to Professor W. G. Lambert for his comments and critique. I am also indebted to Dr. Irving Finkel for his many suggestions, to Dr. W. Schramm for his comments and to Mr J. N. Postgate for collations, as well as the Trustees of the British Museum for permission to publish the tablets. Responsibility for any errors is entirely my own. 1 CT 16, 46-49, and E. Ebeling, " Zwei Tafeln der Serie utukku limn?tu ", AfO 16 (1952-3), 298-304. Ebeling published the tablet (VAT 13660 -f 14047) in transliteration only, although the tablet is clear enough to be collated from photographs. I am grateful to Dr. Schramm for pointing out to me that Ebeling had incorrectly read the colophon of the tablet as Tablet 13, instead of 12. Two tablets, mss. q and r, cited in the footnotes in CT 16 46-47, are from Babylon, but add little to the text of Tablet 12. 2 I am grateful to Professor Wiseman for allowing me to work from his copy and collations of ND 4375, and for the numbers BM 38131 and 36714, which I identified as duplicates. I am also indebted to Professor Lambert for BM 31446 and ? 9397, which he identified. For other unpublished Kuyunjik fragments, cf. R. Borger, Bi Or 30 (1973), 175b (photograph of K. 4616, to which I have joined K. 5077), and HKL II, 344, 390. Many of the ? fragments were identified by Professor Borger and Dr. Schramm. 3 The NA and LB texts can be considered as examples of a single recension, since the texts are relatively uniform in all surviving copies.</page><page sequence="2">24 M. J. GELLER The third category of MA textual variants consists of differences in meaning between the MA text (both in its Sum. and Akk. versions) and later parallel texts, indicating a different textual tradition from that of ??/LB sources. In some cases, the MA text is characteristically brief, lacking details which are contained in parallel texts, such as references to Eridu in 11. 2'-3', Nammu in 11. ??'-? i', and the ktikan?- tree in 11. i7'-i8'. In other instances, the MA Sum. and Akk. are at variance with ??/LB texts, as in 11. io'-i4', in which the MA text reads, " in the holy house, in the forest, the shadow of which is cast where no one proceeds ", while parallel texts read, " in the holy house whose shadow stretches forth like a forest, into the midst of which no one enters ". In 11. 21'-22', the MA text calls for Girru to go to the side of a distraught man, while the ? A/LB texts ask the Udu and lamassu- spirits to be present at the patient's side. The brevity and uniqueness of the MA text in comparison with the ??/LB recension raises important questions regarding the place of the MA recension in the transmission of the text of Utukk? Lemn?tu. Valuable information about the text of one incantation in Tablet 12 can be derived from the oldest surviving exemplar, a Sum. incantation from Susa on an OAkk. tablet, which parallels the beginning of our MA text. In the following edition of the Susa incantation, MDP 14, 91, only the obverse is translated and annotated, since the reverse is not relevant to the present study : obv. i ?nr?n.nu.ru [lugal] gis.k?n.gim ki.sikil m?.a den.ki gi?.k?n.gim 5 ki.sikil m?.a kur.ku.r?.a.ni kur h?.gal su ki.Du.DU.ni gissu.bi muS(!) za.g?n.na.gim ab.S?.ga l?.a io lugal gi?.kin.gim ki.sikil.e ?b.m?.a gim den.ki giS.kin.gim ki.sikil.e ?b.m?.a gim [.]x a[. . . .] rev. ?

Notes (References to the later recensions refer to the edition of Tablet 12 below, 11. 2 '-6'.) 1. Cf. Falkenstein, LSS nf i, 4-6, 79; this superscript, common to OB incantations, tends to disappear in later parallel texts, as it does here. 2. lugal is restored from 1. 10. None of the later recensions refer either to Enki or lugal, but to Eridu (1. 2').</page><page sequence="3">A MIDDLE ASSYRIAN TABLET OF UTUKK? LEMN?TU, TABLET 12 25 6. For kur.ku(r), cf. ?. Sj?berg, AS 16, 65 f., in which he cites evidence for kur.ku (or ku.kur) as " flood ", " wish ", or " triumph ". The later recensions all replace kur.ku with den.ki.ke4 ki.DU.DU (1. 6'), apparently combining 11. 6-7 into a single line. The end of the line, h?.g?l su, is duplicated in later copies. 7. Although the word g issu appears in 1. 12' of the later recensions, and ki.DU.DU in 1. 6', this line is not duplicated elsewhere. 8. The reading m?? is based upon the parallel texts (1. 4'). The sign is, as written, apin, which oners no satisfactory meaning in the context. Since the difference between apin and m?? is a single horizontal stroke, the scribe may have erred in his copy. The writing of za.gin as g?n.za, which is characteristic of Early Dynastic orthography, may be an anachronistic writing. 9. Later recensions have ab zu instead of ab. ? ?. g a, because of the association of the Aps? with Eridu (1. 4'),* and they omit the reference to shade (gissu), rendering the line: ** Its radiance (of the kilkan?) of pure lapis lazuli stretches forth into the Aps?.'* 10-13. These lines repeat the opening phrases, with the syntax altered. The repetition does not occur in later recensions. The Sum. incantation from Susa is the oldest surviving example of the Sum. original upon which the bilingual kiikanu-incantdLtiori in Utukk? was based.5 Never- theless, the decisive differences between the OAkk. and later parallel texts must not be overlooked. The purpose of the Susa text is to compare Enki to the kiSkan?- tree, whereas the later recensions invoke the kiikan?-trte without a direct com- parison to Enki. Moreover, the Susa text describes the ki?kan? in general terms, as growing in a pure place, with its shade stretching over the sea, while later recensions identify the pure place as Eridu, and the sea as the Aps?. Hence, although the Susa incantation is an early exemplar of one incantation of Utukk? Lemn?tu, Tablet 12, it is far from being an exact duplicate. The fact which emerges from this study is that the MA text differs significantly from both earlier and later recensions of Tablet 12, although the MA text is closer to the ??/LB recension. Nevertheless, two additional factors must be considered in determining the place of the MA recension in the history of the text. First, although no OB example of the fa'ifam?-incantation of Utukk? Lemn?tu, Tablet 12, is known, it is clear from OB copies of other tablets of Utukk? Lemn?tu that Sum. fZ/wMiZ-incantations were compiled during the prolific literary activity of the OB period. It is therefore likely that an OB recension of Tablet 12 became the basis for later recensions. Second, the MA tablet does not show the combination of Babylonian and Assyrian grammatical forms which is present in other MA literary texts, including incantations.? Hence, the MA variations cannot be explained as an Assyrian dialect recension of Utukk?, since the MA text does not deviate from SB dialect. Bearing these factors in mind, one can suggest the following possibilities for the different recensions of Tablet 12 : (1) More than one SB recension of Tablet 12 was formed during the OB period, 4 See notes to 11. 18 -20 of the text edition. 5 S. Langdon, " The Legend of the kiSkan? ", JRAS 1928, 843 f. Cf. A. Ferrara, Nanna-Suen's Journey to Nippur (Rome, 1973), 109. ? Cf. W. G. Lambert and A. R. Millard, Atra-hasts (Oxford, 1969), 36-38; and W. G. Lambert, " A Middle Assyrian Tablet of Incantations ", AS 16, 285 ; in both texts the MA copies appear to be examples of Assyrian recensions.</page><page sequence="4">26 M. J. GELLER with texts fixed during the Kassite period.7 The MA and ??/LB recensions are descendants of two different SB recensions. (2) The briefer MA text was a condensed version of a single SB recension, which is best known from NA and LB copies. (3) The MA text is closer to an original SB recension, which was altered and expanded in a ??/LB recension. Conclusive evidence is not yet available to support any one of the above suggestions. The Manuscripts The MA tablet is of baked reddish clay, with a whitish surface on the obverse which appears on other MA tablets.8 Although the script is indicative of a library hand, the errors in the text attest to the scribe's carelessness or ignorance.9 The arrangement of the bilingual passage is somewhat unusual, since each line of text consists of a Sum. version on the left, and an Akk. version on the right. Rulings occur in regular intervals of one to three lines, to separate sentences. Among the NA copies from ASSurbanipal's Library, MSS. ? and C are both six-column tablets which are identical in format, and are possibly from the hand of the same scribe. Only the rubrics are marked with rulings. MS. i, also perhaps from AS?urbanipal's Library, is a large four-column tablet in LB script, which lacks the rubrics found on NA libary copies from Kuyunjik ; incantations are separated by a single ruling. MS. O, from Assur, is a four-column tablet in ? A script with many of the lines underscored, as in the MA tablet. Similarly. MS. M, a library tablet in NA script from Nimrud with four columns preserved, also bears rulings at intervals of one to three lines. Finally, MSS. n, s, and v, all in LB script, are school texts. The composite text below of part of Utukk? Lemn?tu, Tablet 12, corresponding to CT 16, 46 : 183-49 : 31 *j relies upon the MA tablet as the basic text, with the gaps restored from ??/LB duplicates.10 The aim is to present a composite text of this section of Utukk?, utilizing wherever possible the atypical MA recension. A future text edition of the Utukk?-stnes, however, must be based upon the standard NA/LB recension. The composite text below, although based primarily on the MA text, follows the conventions of ASSurbanipaPs Library, to avoid confusion in the presentation. Thus, the Sum, and Akk. versions of each line are arranged in an interlinear format, and only the rubrics are set off by line rulings. Moreover, bracketing has been used sparingly, for reasons of simplicity. Square brackets are used to indicate theoretical restorations, where no duplicate text is extant among the tablets presented. Technically, however, all non-MA lines should also be bracketed to indicate gaps in the MA text, but this would call for a cumbersome system of two types of brackets, to mark both non-MA and theoretical restorations. Instead, the apparatus in the left-hand margin of the transliteration 7 E. Reiner, Surpu (AfO Beiheft 11, ?97?)&gt; 2? 8 Cf. Lambert, AS 16, 283. ? Cf. 11. 7', 23', and 24', and Lambert, ibid., 284, in which he notes badly written signs, frequent erasures, and textual corruptions. 10 The composite text does not include obv. col. i of the MA tablet, since it is fragmentary and fills no gaps in the series. Additional notes are included on its textual variants.</page><page sequence="5">A MIDDLE ASSYRIAN TABLET OF UTUKK? LEMN?TU, TABLET 12 27 will indicate which lines are MA (MS. A = MA), and copies of the tablets will also serve as guides to the individual versions.11 Finally, the composite text has not followed the line numeration oiCT 16, since the beginning of Tablet 12 is missing, which makes continuous numbering pro- visional, and Thompson's numeration for the latter parts of the tablet should now be replaced.

The transcription is based upon the MA version (A ii : 2'-30'), although several signs which have been erroneously omitted by the MA scribe are supplied from variants (cf. 11. 7, 23 and 24). 1'. MS. q contains a superscription at the top of the tablet : [ina\ra~*-mat dB?l u dB?lti-ia [lis-lim] ; cf. Hunger, Kolophone, 95 : 6; 425:6. 2'-3'. Cf. MS. i (= CT 16, 46: 183-4), gis.k?n.gee e, kis-ka-nu-? sal-mu ir-bi, " a black kiskan?- tree grew ". MS. q has r?~\[a = rab? (cited in AHw 938b as the only instance of this equation), while MS. i (cited above) has e for ?. Cf. Ferrara, NSJN, 1. 29. 6'~7'. Cf. MSS. i and ? : " the way of Ea in Eridu ". The MA text lacks the reference to Eridu, as does the duplicate from Susa (MDP 14, 91 : 2), although not for the same reason. The MA text clearly identifies the pure place of the kiskan? as Eridu (1. 2'), but lacks the reference to Eridu in 11. 6,~7/ probably for the sake of brevity. The Susa text, however, lacks reference to Eridu throughout. The MA text contains two lexical variants. The usual equivalent for ki.DU.DU is tallaktu (as in MSS. i, n, q) rather than MA alaktu (= a.r?), and the MA use of Bu.ta.?m = ma-(la-at) is</page><page sequence="16">38 M. J. GELLER uncommon, although attested elsewhere in CT 18, 40 : 38 (Lanu), BU-i = ma-lu-[u\. The MA bu for mal? may be an error for su, which is a similar sign in OB script, and su appears both in the Susa text (MDP 14, 91 : 6) and in MS. r (su. su. g a. a). For the form ofmalati of MSS. i and r, cf. GAG, p. 98 (NB form of the 3 f. s. stative), which is not the form to be restored after ma- of the MA text. The writing ma-(la-at) is an example of the occasional carelessness of the MA scribe. The MA and ??/LB versions of this line must be compared with the Susa text, since the later recensions all show a sudden shift in subject : 11. 2'-5' of our edition refer to the growth of the kiskan? in Eridu, while 11. 6' f. describe Ea's way of abundance in Eridu, his dwelling place, etc. This sudden shift of subject from the kiskan? to Enki/Ea does not occur in the O Akk. version, in which Enki is always the subject, who is compared to the kiskan?. It is therefore likely that the later recensions altered the incantation?which was originally addressed to Enki?as an address to the kiskan?-tree, probably to conform to the subsequent incantation in Tablet 12 which is addressed to the date palm. 8'. MS. ? adds ki bulugx an.na; for reading bulugx, cf. J. Krecher, Sumerische Kultlyrik (Wiesbaden, 1966), 137-138. 10'. Cf. MS. i, which adds dnammu.?m, and MS. n, which adds dnammu.a.ke4, referring to the bed of Nammu rather than Ea. The MA text has omitted the reference to Nammu, perhaps in the interest of brevity, or wishing to continue to refer to Enki/Ea without the additional reference to his mother Nammu. I2'-I3'. There are several significant variants in these lines. Cf. MS. i (= CT 16, 46: 193-4), " in the holy house whose shade stretches forth like a forest, into the midst of which no one enters ". Not only does the MA text lack the phrase kima qisti, but three other interesting variants appear : (a) The MA Sum. has du for tarsu, instead of the more common la of the duplicate texts. Although d ? = tar?su is more rare, it is attested elsewhere (cf. Lambert, ? WL, 119: 7-8, b ?. i ?. d ?. a = itarrasu). (b) The MA use of ?ru for ku4.ku4 is unattested elsewhere, while the duplicates use the expected value of er?bu for ku4.ku4. Nevertheless, the use of ?ru in this context has close parallels, as in CT 16, 43 : 69, a-na an-? s? la a-a-ri (? ?.a) is-su-?, " they fled to heaven, where no one is to pro- ceed " ; cf. also CT 17, 34 : 23, and KAR, 101 ii 7-8 (Langdon, OECTW, 55 : 7-8). These parallels, as well as the writing ?-ir-ru, indicate that the MA scribe had not simply written ?ru for er?bu in error, but was using a common idiomatic expression, (c) The MA text translates ?.gee.gee.ga.a.ni.?? (lit. " to his dark house ") with simply ina ? ??, " in the pure house ", whereas the duplicates read ?.k?.ga.a.ni.ta, ina ? ellu (Sum. : " from his pure house ", Akk. : "in a pure house "). It is possible that the MA discrepancy can be explained by the scribe's confusion of the ku and gee signs, which have the same number of strokes. In all recensions, however, the text is corrupt. 17'. These names were incorrectly rendered by the MA scribe as dka.ug.gal and digi.hu?.gal. Kahegal and Igihegal were two of the eight doorkeepers of Enki. i8'-2o'. The text of the ??/LB recension differs considerably from the MA version (cf. CT 16, 47 : 200-201 ) : dka.h?.g?l digi.he.g?l dIa.ha.ma.abzu NUNk,.ga.ke4 giS.kin.bi ?u im.ma.an.ti mu7.mu7 abzu ba.an.se dMiN dMiN dlah-mu ap-si-i s? eriA-du10 kis-ka-nu-? su-a-t? il-q?-? si-pat ap-si-i i-d[u-?] " Kahegal, Igihegal, and Lahmu of the Aps? of Eridu, took that kiskan?-tree and recited the incantation of the Aps? ". Cf. TCL 15, 10: 103, in which the god dla. ha.ma.abzu is cited after Kahegal and Igihegal Cf. also A. Falkenstein, An.Or. 30, 80. The MA version is greatly condensed, omitting reference to the " mouth " of the rivers (although found in the Sum. 1. i6' ka.min, and in MSS. ? and q, pi n?r?ti), and to the taking of the kiskan?- tree for reciting the incantation of the Aps?. The MA text also refers to the god dla.ha.ma, rather than dla.ha.ma.abzu. Furthermore, the MA scribe has not divided the lines according to the sense of the passage, but he has divided a lengthy sentence into five registers on the tablet (11. ??'-? 1' ; i2'-i3'; i4'-i5'; i6'-i8'; ?9'-2?')? The registers are not always divided appropriately, since in 11. i6'-i8' the scribe has run-on two clauses in one register while prematurely truncating the second clause before its final verb (cf. 11. ?8'-2?'). The duplicate versions, on the other hand, tend to preserve complete clauses in each single line.</page><page sequence="17">A MIDDLE ASSYRIAN TABLET OF UTUKK? LEMN?TU, TABLET 12 39 T. Jacobsen, in Toward the Image of Tammuz, opp. p. ?, suggests that the kiskan? was consecrated by reciting its origin. Since the kiskan? grew in Eridu (according to 11. 2'~3'), it is logical that it be used with the incantation of the Aps?, since Eridu is closely associated with the Aps? (cf. En. el. I, 69-77, IV 142 : after killing Aps?, Ea made his cosmic home above it). Cf. W. G. Lambert's comments, in Blacker and Loewe, Ancient Cosmologies (1975), 56-57. Eridu, as Enki's abode, thus became identified with the Aps?. The importance of the kiskan?-tree to this incantation draws attention to the lack of any reference to the kiskan? in 11. i7'-2o' of the MA recension. In contrast, the corresponding ??/LB recension of these lines refers to the three gods who " took that kiskan? and recited the incantation of the Aps? ", which resumes the opening theme of the incantation?the address to the kiskan?-tree. In the MA text, however, no mention is made of the kiskan? after the first few lines, which detracts from the effectiveness of the composition, since the kiskan? is not related to the rest of the incantation. On purely literary grounds, therefore, the MA version of this incantation is inferior to that of the later recensions. The Susa text, however, shows that in its original form the kiskan? was only a peripheral part of the incantation, which was actually addressed to Enki. At an early stage (as in the MA text), the emphasis of the opening lines was shifted from an address to Enki, to the kiskan? (cf. notes to 11. 6'-7'), although the subject soon reverted again to Enki and other gods. In the later ??/LB recension, however, this shift of subject was harmonized, since Enki and his companion gods used the kiskan? to perform the incantation. It appears, therefore, that the MA recension could represent an inter- mediate stage in the development of the incantation, which was refined in ??/LB recensions, although this supposition must remain tentative until an OB recension of Tablet 12 emerges. 21 '-22'. The MA version is again more brief than the parallel texts (cf. CT 16, 47 : 205-206) : l?.Ux.lu dumu dingir.ra.na udug.sig5.ga "lamina sig5.ga he.en.su8.s[u8.ge.e?], s? l? mar dingir-?w se-ed dum-ql la-mas-si du-un-qi i-da-a-su lu ka-[a-a-a]n " may the good s?du-spirit and good /am&amp;Mt/-spirit of a man, the son of his god, be regularly placed at his side ". No mention is made of either the distraught man (muttalliku) or of the god Girru, as in the MA version, which suggests that the MA text of this line has significant variants. 23'-24'. The two signs omitted from the MA tablet, ?? and im, exemplify the occasional careless- ness of the MA scribe. Note, however, in var. D and ? the use ofh?tib for h?tim, which must represent the phonetic change of b for m. Otherwise, the translation of the line is most difficult, and is cited by AHw, 1225b, as unclear. According to the context, the expression sk-s? l? summu should refer to a demon who has not yet turned his attention upon the victim, thus excluding the demon before he has attacked the victim, i.e. an ounce of prevention. 26'. The use of the IV/i stem, lipparis, in the MA text is preferable in the context to the I/i stem liprus of the parallel texts. Note that MSS. ? and i add an additional line: nig.nam.ma fru?.dim.ma bar.s? Ij?.em.ta.gub, e-pi-i]I(?) le-mut-ti ina a-ha-a-ti li-iz-ziz, "may anything doing evil stand aside ". 27'. The MA gir. a is preferable to gir. ? m (gir -f copula) in MS. i. 28'. The MA version of this line, " may Ningestina, the king's sister, go with him ", gives a completely different meaning from the rendering of text i : dnin-gestin-an]-na a-hat sar-ri ina ur-hu lik-lis, " May Ningestinanna, the king's sister, hold him back on the way " (cf. CT 16, 47 : 214, noting incorrect restoration). Although the latter reading is preferable in the context, the form liklis is unusual, since one would expect to find liklasu. dNingestina is elsewhere called bilet seri ; cf. CT 16, 9 ii : 4-5 ; and A. Deimel, Pantheon Babylonicum, 79. 29-30'. The ??/LB recension of this line reads: da-a-a-an-tuA rabi(GAL)-ti mu-du-ti el-let dis-tar ina b?ti(t) lip-ru-us-su, " may the great, wise, holy judge Istar exclude him from the house ". The fern, adjectives all refer to Istar. Something is wrong with the MA reading of this line. As it stands, the line could mean, " may the wise judges, holy ones of I?tar, exclude him from the house ", or alternatively, " may the wise holy judges exclude IStar from the house ", which seems unlikely in this context. 34'. The MA version is partially restored from duplicates (cf. CT 16, 47 : 221). 35'~75'. The MA version of these lines is not extant.</page><page sequence="18">40 M. J. GELLER 41'-44'. Text ? has several peculiarities, such as den.ki{ki} dnammu, which is a probable dittography. In 1. 44' the scribe has badly written diDiM u with a spurious vertical edge. Note the Akk. homonyms, na'?du, " be attentive ", and na'?du, " praise ", although only the latter corresponds to Sum. i (cf. AHw II, 693a, 705a), which is found in this text. 45'. Falkenstein, in LSS nf 1, 65-66, considered this line to be " nicht ganz klar ", rendering it as dug4den.ki.ke4 kun.? h?.ag.e (cf. CT 17, ? : 34-35, 2i : 92-93). The difficulty lies in the meaning ofpah?.?.a.ke4, which Falkenstein resolves by assuming pa.? = s?p?, " sch?n und gut " (cf. AHw, 1281a), and h?.ag.e = ep?su, although the words s?p? and ep?su do not appear in the Akk. translation (simply amat dea list?p?). Note, however, that MS. ? only reads pa \}?.?, omitting a.ke4, which suggests that these might have represented grammatical particles nominalizing the sentence (lit. " for the proclaiming of the word of Ea "). 47'. Falkenstein, in LSS nf 1, 66 follows CT 17, 21 : 94 and 26 : 82, si h?.en.si.s?.e. 49'. An Akk. translation for the line is found in CT 17, 21 : 96. 51 '. The passage could refer to a date palm orchard planted specifically for cultic purposes ; cf. SBH, 145 ii 24 : ana kiri6 us-sa-a ana kiri? da-nim i-ru-um-ma, " he goes out into the garden, he enters the garden of Anu . . .". Since gardens were regularly associated with temples, and belonging to gods, it is possible that 1. 51'f. refers to a palm frond actually taken from a garden of Anu (cf. 11. 63'-64'). This incipit is also found in a catalogue of the series Musstfu (cf. BAM III, 215 : 28). 52'. CAD G, 103 incorrectly restores kir?ti for sipp?ti. According to Landsberger, however, the term fak?nu in date palm contexts refers to the management of an orchard, and although s?kinu is synonymous with nukarribu, " gardener " (cf. 1. 64' below), the s?kinu is not a gardener but a manager of the date harvest (cf. Landsberger, Date Palm, 56 f.). 57'-58'. Cf. SBH, 56:27-28: lipiS.m?.?m ? nam.ur.sag.g? ? nam.ur.sag.g? me.[e] si.in.ga.me ?, sur-ri ta-ha-zi i-di qar-ra-du-ti e-mu-qan [qa]r-ra-du-ti ana-ku, " I (IStar) am the heart of the battle, the hand of the hero, the strength of heroism ". The expression id?n qard?ti (= ? nam.ur.sag.g?.ke4) is intended metaphorically to depict the date palm with "heroic arms", similar to descriptions of Istar. 64'. A hemeroiogical text specifying what should be avoided on the fifth day of the month, specifies : ud 5 kam ana kiris la ur-rad digi.sig7.sig7 l? nu.kiri, dEN.L?L sig-su, " on the fifth day, he should not descend into the garden, or Igisigsig, the gardener of Enlil, will strike him " (KAR, 177 r i : 22 ; and Langdon, Menologies, 102-103). 67'. This is possibly the incantation priest referring to himself in the third person, an example of Falkenstein's Legitimationstyp (LSS nf 1, 23 f.), or a general reference to Marduk. 72' f. The priest placed the date palm frond on the patient's head, and binding his limbs with fronds recited the incantation. 75 -76'. Cf. CT 17, 18:8-9. 76'-!07'. The text is based upon the MA version (A rev. iii). 8o'. For the idiomatic use of kullu with risu meaning " to provide with, take care of ", cf. CAD ?, 517b. The MA reading likil is incorrect in the sing., since the Sum. (h?.en.dun.duis.e.ne) is pi., as is the form o? kullu in the parallel texts (li-kil-lu). 86/-87/. These lines, together with Akk. interlinear translation, were transcribed by Ebeling in AfO 16, 299: 33-38, but they do not appear on the Assur tablet (MS. O). MS. k adds a new line here, which is probably to be restored from CT 16, 4: 165: sil7.l? igi.mu.ta zi.an.na h?.p? [zi.ki.ah?.p?] (= dup-pir ina pa-ni-ia AN-e lu-u ta-mat ??-tim lu-u ta-mat). The line could also be restored from CT 16, 4: 157-158: sil7.l? igi.mu ?.ta ba.ra.?, dup-pir ina pa-ni-ia i?-tu t ?[-?, " go away from before me, go out from the house ". The restoration from CT 16, 4: 165 is more likely since it contains a typical concluding formula before a rubric, just as 1. 86' occurs immediately before a subscript. 88'. MS. ? incorporates a second line into the subscript, which Landsberger (Date Palm, 26) restores as gi?.peS.[gisimmar sag.g?.na g?.g?.ra.kam] (= CT 16, 48 : 267). 89'. For the use of sAR.a = nab?, cf. CT 18, 29: 32b (Group vocab.) : sar = na-bi-i. The equation dim = s?mu should be compared with dim = iu-um-mu in CT 12, 37 i : 23 (Nabn. IV A). In the parallel line 92', MS. O has ibbani, which is a more common value for dim than J?mu. This incipit is found in the Mulsu'u catalogue of BAM III, 215 : 28.</page><page sequence="19">A MIDDLE ASSYRIAN TABLET OF UTUKK? LEMN?TU, TABLET 12 41 94'? Variants (k and O) have egirr? (i n i m. gar) for pu, as in AMT, 102 : 8, e-gir-ru-? lem-nu s? ni-si, " an evil reputation among the people ", which explains the context of this passage : the patient is suffering from an evil reputation, and his name has been maligned by others. Cf. Surpu V/VI, 154-155, which cites the m?mitu (oath/curse) of the evil reputation among mankind, and Surpu IX, 96-106, a group of rituals against the evil tongue, all of which end with the phrase, erne.hul.gal bar.Se h?.im.ta.gub, " may the evil tongue stand aside ". 99'-i02'. The sentence appears incongruous in this context, since the subject suddenly shifts to the predicament of the country, attacked by demons, rather than the afflictions of the individual. However, the metaphoric bin?t m?ti, " limbs of the land " treats the land in anthropomorphic terms, thus perhaps equating the country with an individual. In 11. 101'-102', the unspecified subject must be the disease-bearing demons which toss disease from house to house, although this sentence likewise does not follow smoothly with the preceding passage. Note that, in 1. 102', the MA scribe has omitted istu (cf. Sum. ta), which is supplied in MS. O. io6'. Restored from C? i6, 45 : 119 and a similar MA line (A i : 16'). iu'-ii2'. Cf. CT 17, 19:36-37^ z?d u.me.ni.hur, q?-ma e-sir-ma. The sentence is either corrupt or a shorthand instruction, which calls for the use of flour to make an image of the namtar- demon beside the patient's bed. Cf. CT 17, 32: 1-2, alam.bi zag *l8n[?.da.na.ke4] z?d.Se ?.me.[ni.hur], sa-lam-s? i-da-at er-[si-su s]a tap-pi-in-ni re1-[sir-ma], " draw his image beside his bed with coarse flour " (restored from ? 3481, cf. CAD e, 317b). In this latter case, however, the image is of the patient himself, as shown by the rubric of the passage which calls for the making with flour of a salam andun?nisu " the image for his substitute " (ibid. 23:inim.inim.ma al am nig.sag.il.la z?d.?e.kam). In our text, however, the incantation priest was making an image of the namtar-demon, which is closer to the Maql? rituals in which the priest makes an image of the sorcerer and sorceress (Maql? IX, 153, 157-158). Because of the grammatical difficulties, er su in 1. 112' should probably be understood as an accus. of place, or perhaps as an haplography for er-(I?)-s?, although this latter suggestion is not borne out by the Sum. *!ln?. Another alternative is to consider er su as a second direct object o?es?ru, with the priest making an image of the " bed of his namtar ", although this is unlikely to be the meaning of the passage. 113'. The photo of MS. O shows room for another sign after gar. 128'. Despite the reference to Dumuzi in 1. 130', Marduk is probably meant as the shepherd of I. 128'. Cf., however, F?rber, BID, 68 : 55, an incantation to the milk of a yellow goat, sa ina tarbasi elli ?a r?'? dumuzi Valdu, " which was born in the holy pen of Dumuzi the shepherd ". Elsewhere, Sin is credited with providing food for the tarbasu and sup?ru (Langdon, 0ECTV1, 9: 4-5). 132'-133'. For a parallel text, cf. 4?2, 30 ii : 4-5 : u ? s i 1 a 4. b i ga.ga.mu, lah-ra ? pu-has-sa i-sal- la-l[u, " they plunder the ewe and her lamb ". 134'. One might expect some form of the verb leq?, as in CT 17, 20: 74: sigkirxgis.nu.zu su.u.me.ti, s?-rat ?-ni-qi la pi-ti-ti li-qi-ma. Perhaps the verb is to be found in the break in II. 136-137', although it is not clear whether the few signs preserved in MS. ? (? ? bi mu. ? i. in.) belong to 1. 136'. 138'f. The equation bur.su.gal urn.ma = pursumtu is so far unattested elsewhere (cf. AHw II, 881 b). The break at the end of the line may contain ?hdinanna.ke4. In Surpu V/VI, 144-163, Uttu performs a similar function. With IStar's guidance, Uttu spins a thread of white and black wool, which breaks oaths and curses ; she ties the patient's head, hands, and feet with the thread, so that Marduk can break the curse by removing the thread. Cf. Surpu V/VI, 151 : si-pa-a-te pi-sa-a-te si-pa-a-te sal-[ma-a-te] qa-a is-pa ina pi-lak-ki it-me, " she spun on a spindle, twined thread of white wool and black wool ". Similarly in our text, Uttu spins white and black wool (11. 134-135'), which is used to bind a patient's limbs (1. I43'-I44'). I39'-I42'. Cf. CT 17, 20:75-76 (Asakk? mars?tu) : munus mud.da.gi4.a ?.zi.da.Se u. m e. n i. k ? ? a.g?b.bu.S? u.me.ni.tab, sin-nis-tu pa-ris-tu im-na lip-me-ma su-me-la li-sip, "may a menopausal woman spin with the right (hand), twine with the left (hand) ". This passage is particularly important since the previous line (ibid., 20: 74) has already been cited as a parallel to 11. i34'-i35' above, which confirms that Uttu (1. 138') is spinning the wool gathered from the virgin sheep and goat (11. 134'-!35').</page><page sequence="20">42 M. J. GELLER ?^,?'-?f'. For the restoration, cf. CT 17, 26 : 70 : l?.ux.lu dumu dingir.ra.na sag.g?.na u. m e. ? i. su, me-e su-nu-ti (va.r. -t?) a-me-lu dumu dingir-jw s?-lu-uh-ma (var. su-luh). 163'. This incipit occurs in the Muss?'u catalogue of BAM III, 215 : 31. 164'. The use in this context of dek? 4- ana " to summon " is of interest, since it usually refers to the mobilization of troops or corv?e workers. i66'-i67'. The repetition of tnursa(GiG) in the Akk. version implies that the first clause (mursa . . . ihammatu) is in stat. rect. The grammatical difficulties are reflected in the Sum. clause in the expressions sa.gig.ga and gig.ga. According to CAD b, 317, sa.gig.ga = bunnann? is a hapax in this clause, with gig.ga = mursa. The problem is, however, that the Akk. repeats mursa twice, which cannot be accounted for in the Sum. if sa.gig.ga = bunnann?. Hence, a more likely solution is that sa = bunnann? (|| sa = ser*anu), and thus the repetition of mursa in Akk. reflects gig.ga . . . gig.ga in the Sum. 167'-2o6'. The Akk. text, wherever possible, is based upon the MA version, or otherwise restored from MS. O. The brackets in 11. 185'-198' indicate theoretical restorations. 171'-i72'. Since the Sum. sag.g?.na is not translated by the MA Akk. (cf. however MS. B, ina resL?), it is not clear whether sag.g?.na would have appeared in the MA Sum. which is not extant. 174'-176'. To give some sense, the word iz-z^-an is translated as I/i, perf., although the form is unusual. i79'-i84'. The restoration of the Sum. is based upon MS. B. These lines do not appear in the photograph of MS. O. i89'-i9o'. The Akk. of MS. O gives an entirely different meaning: lib]-bi ka-bat-ti s? dingir nu-uh-hu, " to appease the heart and mind of the god ". The difference between MSS. A and O is in the interpretation of bar.ra, since bar can mean both la (for bara) or kabattu (cf. Deimel, II/i, 155-156). 191'. For a discussion of su tu g/sutukku, cf. Reiner, Surpu, 61 a. The sutukku seems to have been a circle of reeds defining a holy place, used for offerings or rituals ; according to AHw, 1294, it is a reed hut for rituals. It is therefore likely that in our text the incantation was intended to be recited within the sutukku, with the rituals to be performed within it as well. 208'. Although the d?u disease is usually associated with headache, this is a clear case of dVu attacking the entire body ; cf. CAD d, 166. 210'. MS. O adds a colophon identifying the tablet (AfO 16, 304 : 30-31) : inim.inim.ma udug.hul.k?m dub 12 kam.me ?n g?.e lu.k?.ga me.en udug.hul.mes Addendum : Notes on the MA tablet, obv. i : (line numbers refer to the tablet) 7'. iGi-su might be an error for iGi-ku (cf. MS. i = CT 16, 44 : 111 : igi.zu, ana p?nika). 12'. MS. i (? CT 16, 44: 115) reads iq-bi-is ( = e) rather than the MA ip-qi-su. Since e = paq?du is not attested elsewhere, it is possible that MA ipqissu is an error for iqbis, although the expression amata paq?du is meaningful as it stands. 13'. The MA version is possibly corrupt, reading ina ma-a-a-li-s? su-qam-mu-me ina s?-na-q? a-ma-ta su-a-ti is-me-ma, " on his silent couch, upon investigating (or approaching), he (Marduk) heard this report". Compare the simpler version in CT 16, 45 : 117 : ina qul-ti ma-a-al mu-si a-mat su-a-ti is-m?-e-ma, " in the quiet couch of the night, he heard this report ". i9'-2o'. CT 16, 45:123-124 reads: al-ka-ka-a-ti si-bit-ti-s?-nu la-ma-du ?s-ra-ti-s?-nu si-te-'e-a hi-sam-ma, " hasten to learn the ways of the Seven, to seek out their places ". In the MA version, these actions are expressed as a. fait accompli: al-ka-kat imin-??-wh id-di-na ?s-ri-f?-nu is-te-?-ma, " he has given over the customary ways of the Seven of them, he has sought out their places ". From the two Sum. signs remaining on the MA tablet, it appears that the MA Sum. version was also more condensed than the later variants, omitting the final clause sag.na.an.gi?. mu .un.na.an.s ?. 33'. Cf. CT 16, 45 : 142 : sa ina l?b-bi-su d?-a su-mu zak-ru, " in his heart Ea is invoked ", which differs in meaning from the MA version, ]x ni-is dDi? zok-ru, " ]sworn by Ea ".</page><page sequence="21">A MIDDLE ASSYRIAN TABLET OF UTUKK?
