And a mortal existence_ IN ot a single cat appears in the pages of this special double issue of JAC on the human-animal encounter (except, of course, Derrida's cat), though it was certainly cats, including the ones featured on the cover of this issue, that led me, circuitously and after a lifetime of cohabitation, to the idea of devoting attention to what Derrida so famously phrased "the question of the animal." In late 2008, when I first published the call for papers for this special issue, I admit I was only vaguely aware of the burgeoning interdisciplinary field of animal studies. As an avid reader of university press catalogues, I have made, over the years, a mental note of titles related in some way to animal life. Yet, I hadn't quite pulled those titles together in my mind to form anything like a full awareness of the field of animal studies. It existed only in my peripheral vision when I seized upon the idea of devoting a special issue of the journal to the human-animal Lynn Worsham ?Jacques Derrida jac 303-4(2010)</page><page sequence="2">406 jac relation. The idea for this issue came to me most directly?seized me, in fact, and insisted I fol low its lead?in a moment of acute exasperation after receiving yet another article submission (there have been many) whose author was clearly besotted with what he saw as the salutary ways in which our latest tools?digital technology and new media, in particular? have transformed the essence of "the human." While I have no doubt that these associated technologies have transformed and will transform human experience, I am nonetheless weary of the often exaggerated (often wildly exaggerated) claims championing the impact of digital technology. (I am weary most especially of the fantasy of omnipotence that seems to lurk within many of the more grandiose of these claims.) So when I received in late 2008 what was then the latest paean to the computerization of everything, I thought to myself, "Enough. It's time that JAC focus attention on animals, on the rhetoric of the human-animal relation." What seized me then was not an ueither-or" habit of thinking?either tools and technologies or animals are more important in delimiting "the human"? but a strong sense that real recogn ition of a sign ificant debt is long overdue. What seized me was a strong suspicion, more visceral than conscious and articulated, that the intoxication with all things digital may amount to another in a long series of deflections from attending, in ethically respon sible ways, to the historically consequential encounter between human and nonhuman animals. I will have more to say about what is at work in this deflection in what follows. My own investment in animal studies stems in part (but only in part) from a longstanding preoccupation with violence, with how we human animals treat one another. "Obsession" might be a better word. For a quarter of a century, I have been driven to understand precisely that which I have not yet been able to get my mind around: those extravagant forms of violence that almost everyone would recognize as atrocities (genocide, ethnic cleansing, suicide bombings, mass rape as a weapon of war, torture) as well as those forms of violence that have become almost routine in the U.S. (rape, domestic abuse, child sexual abuse, spree serial killings, rampage murders, workplace and school killings, family annihilation). Likewise, I have been determined to understand the relation between these forms of extravagant violence and the more invisible and often unremarkable forms of structural and symbolic violence that organize</page><page sequence="3">Lynn Worsham 407 everyday life for the vast majority of people throughout the world. No doubt as a result of having lived through the aftermath of World War II, the cold war and its omnipresent threat of nuclear war, the violence of the 1960s and early 70s, and the violence that this world has seen in the last forty years, I have a felt sense of having lived through what psychologist Robert Jay Lifton describes as a death-saturated age, an age in which all of us are in some sense survivors of catastrophe, our experience inescapably and profoundly marked by death and the violence of our time ("Survivor" 479). The twentieth century was certainly marked by unprec edented violence, so much so that it has been called a "post-traumatic age" and a "catastrophic age" (Farrell 3-7; Caruth 3-12). The violence that has consumed the first decade of the twenty-first century portends an even more deadly and traumatizing future. In this context, the field of animal studies calls on me, on all of us, to relinquish, once and for all, the habit and the hubris of anthropocentrism and humanism and to broaden the sense of "our time" to include the catastrophe that is the systematic and relentless and ongoing exploitation, abuse, and killing of nonhuman animals.1 More to the point that I want to make here, this field of inquiry calls on us to see the deep and abiding connection between how we treat each other and how we treat nonhuman others. (Is it surprising to anyone that the period marked by unspeakable forms of interhuman violence is also marked by what Derrida calls "unprecedented" violence against animals?)2 The field of animal studies calls on us to understand and appreciate, as David Wood puts it (following Derrida), "the importance of the logic of sacrifice in understanding why we [humans] act as we do": human history as the relentless and enduring "age of sacrifice" ("Thinking" 129). Death, catastrophe, trauma, sacrifice? there is more than enough in this history to rivet attention and sustain reflection on the use and abuse of animals as a proving ground for human violence. Today, as a result of my own encounter with the field of animal studies, the problem of violence seems to me to be paradoxically simpler and more utterly mind-boggling than it has ever been. It is not mind-boggling in the sense of being entirely inexplicable. In his response to Derrida's essay "The Animal That Therefore I am (More to Follow)," Wood outlines an explanation of human violence toward both human and nonhuman others and its function in the life of the being we call</page><page sequence="4">408 jac "human." He begins with the connection between language and vio lence?-language, that tool, that medium through which we humans have claimed our difference from and superiority to nonhuman animals. Wood points out that "the use of the word 'animal' or 'the animal' to refer to any and all living creatures is a conceptual violence that expeditiously legiti mates our actual violence" ("Thinking" 133). In two different essays, Wood takes Derrida to task for his use of the words "animal or "the animal"?"as if this were not already a form of deadening shorthand" ("Comment" 29). Wood explains: Categories are gross ways in which we (humans) carve up the world. Violence arises at two levels. First, these categorial distinctions (man/animal, man/woman) are affirmations of the very kinds of distinctions that would block the extension of consideration (for example, from man to animal). For it is no accident that these categorial distinctions are actually wielded by only one of each pair. . . . Second, these categories can be deployed nominally and descriptively so that such violence can be applied to this or that specific animal. "Animal," in other words, is one of the ways we say "Other." ("Thinking" 133; emphasis added) Humans, then, are the kind of creatures who habitually wield conceptual categories as if they were descriptions of reality when in fact they are deeply interested interpretations of reality. Humans are the kind of creatures who use those conceptual categories to exclude others (human and nonhuman others) from moral consideration and to justify actual violence against those we consign to the category "animal." Humans, in short, are the creatures who historically have wielded conceptual catego ries to deny the "unsubstitutable singularity" and irreplaceability of individual living beings, both human and nonhuman. We claim the "life of the mind" as the crowning achievement of evolution, yet ours is the kind of mind that urgently performs its tricks to dazzle the only beings we deem worthy of dazzling: ourselves.3 "Animal," clearly, is not just one conceptual category among others; it is the foundation, if not the origin, of all practices of othering?of claiming and justifying, first, human exceptionalism and, then, of claiming the superiority of particular groups who are seen as belonging legitimately in the category "human." As Wood puts it, "The other animal is the Other par</page><page sequence="5">Lynn Worsham 409 excellence, the being who or which exceeds my concepts, my grasp, etc." ("Comment" 32). Cary Wolfe puts the matter somewhat more pointedly: "Violence against human others (and particularly racially marked others) has often operated by means of a double movement that animalizes them for the purposes of domination, oppression, or even genocide?a maneu ver that is effective because we take for granted the prior assumption that violence againstthe animal is ethically permissible" (567; emphasis added; see also Spiegel and Roberts). True though it may be, Wolfe's observation, with its focus on "racially marked others" as the exemplary case, also obscures the more enduring history in which the category of gender has been used across racial and ethnic lines to animalize, dominate, and oppress women and girls. But why? Why do we humans use the category "animal" in this way and those beings we assign to this category? In his study of the history of slavery in the Americas, Inhuman Bondage, David Brion Davis argues that historically the human freedom to animalize human others and thereby "degrade, dishonor, enslave, and even kill and eat" them has the social and symbolic purpose of creating solidarity and a sense of superiority within a human tribe or group (28-29). Wood says something similar in the context of our treatment of animals: "The way we treat animals is deeply caught up with the ongoing need for symbolic reaffirmation of our own humanity" ("Thinking" 133). In the way we treat nonhuman animals and human others, we symbolically create and recreate the meaning of "human being" as our separation from and transcendence of animal life. Wood himself says what amounts to the same thing when he states that the way we treat nonhuman animals is a "ritual reenactment of a problematic internal relation to our own6 animality"' (132). Perhaps the phrase, "a problematic internal relation to our own animality," offers some insight into what accounts for the deeply contradictory ways in which we live with, think with, and use nonhuman animals?for example, as beloved companions and family members who are given names and sometimes birthday celebrations, funerals, and even trust funds, on the one hand, and on the other, as mere source material for food, clothing, and knowledge (see Fudge). What is it about our animality that is so problematic as to inspire or necessitate the violent reaffirmation of our humanity? Let me just suggest</page><page sequence="6">410 jac one direction for thought. In Hiding from Humanity, Martha Nussbaum writes, "What we are anxious about is a type of vulnerability that we share with other animals, the propensity to decay and to become waste products ourselves" (92). In "The Difficulty of Reality," Cora Diamond makes a similar observation and goes a bit further: The awareness we each have of being a living body, being "alive to the world," carries with it exposure to the bodily sense of vulnerability to death, sheer animal vulnerability, the vulnerability we share with them. This vulnerability is capable of panicking us. To be able to acknowledge it at all, let alone as shared, is wounding; but acknowledging it as shared with other animals, in the presence of what we do to them, is capable not only of panicking one but also of isolating one_(74) In "Thinking with Cats," Wood glosses Derrida's comments on human vulnerability and finitude: "Man is distinctive in knowing he is naked, needing to be clothed, supplemented with technics (like fire, and, we might add, writing and even philosophy [and, more recently, like digital technol ogy and new media]), aware of his lack" (139). Naked and therefore vulnerable, seeking to overcome our own naked vulnerability through tools and technologies, humiliated (indeed, mortified) by the awareness of our animal vulnerability and mortality, wounded, panicked, and isolated by this difficult knowledge, we engage in both symbolic and material practices that are essentially violent in a vain and futile attemptto deny vulnerability and reassert our distinctiveness, our separateness from and superiority to animal life.4 Central to Diamond's discussion of vulnerability is a focus on the experience of what she calls "a difficulty of reality." To experience a difficulty of reality is to experience something I cannot conceptualize, an experience that is resistant to my thinking it, one that is astonishing in its incomprehensibility, or one that is "painful in its inexplicability" (45-46). In Diamond's words, "The difficulty lies in the apparent resistance by reality to one's ordinary mode of life, including one's ordinary modes of thinking" (58). An encounter with a difficulty of reality marks the limit of our concepts, renders them inadequate in the face of reality, renders us vulnerable to their inadequacy, renders us vulnerable to something we</page><page sequence="7">Lynn Worsham cannot get our minds around. As suggested above, an experience of a difficulty of reality may be wounding, panicking, and isolating. What's more, the exposure to a difficulty of reality "shoulders us from a familiar sense of moral life, from a sense of being able to take in and think a moral world" (64). Diamond points out that these sorts of experiences can be highly individual. In other words, what I take to be resistant to my thinking it?what may be astonishing or painful to me in its inexplicability (violence toward others, for example)?may not present the same difficulty to others, may even be seen by others as "unsurprising" (62). In her exploration of the experience of a difficulty of reality, Diamond employs a number of examples, among them J.M. Coetzee's novella, The Lives of Animals. She includes as part of her example the essays that are also in the volume, essays written by a diverse group of scholars. The Lives of Animals is Coetzee's Tanner Lectures presented in 1997-98 at Princeton University. His lectures take the form of a story that is principally comprised of two lectures given by his main character, Elizabeth Costello, an elderly Australian novelist who has travelled to the United States on the invitation of a Midwestern university. This mirroring at the level of structure?two lectures that take the form of a story, a story that is comprised almost entirely of two lectures with a minimal narrative frame?is itself an important theme of the novella. In her remarkable essay, "The Difficulty of Reality," Diamond presents two different ways of reading the volume. She reads Coetzee's novella as "presenting a kind of woundedness or hauntedness." For her, it is "centrally concerned with the presenting of a wounded woman" (47). The commentators, Diamond points out, view the novella quite differently: as Coetzee's "device" for presenting "a position on the issue how we should treat animals" (49). For Diamond, Elizabeth Costello is "haunted by the horror of what we do to animals. We see her as wounded by this knowledge, this horror, and by the knowledge of how unhaunted others are" (46). Diamond continues: "What wounds this woman, what haunts her mind... is what we do to animals. This, in all its horror, is there, in our world. How is it possible to live in the face of it? And in the face of the fact that, for nearly everyone, it is as nothing, as the mere accepted background of life?" (47). In Diamond's reading, Costello encounters a difficulty of reality in the way we treat animals and also in</page><page sequence="8">412 jac the callous indifference that most people exhibit over our treatment of them. Diamond observes that woundedness?the wounded life of the animal at the center of the narrative, Elizabeth Costello?is not seen or appreciated by the commentators who view the central character as Coetzee's mouthpiece for putting forward abstract ethical ideas for debate. For them, her suffering is "as nothing, as the mere accepted background" of the life of the minds that are only interested in the argument that Costello (Coetzee) gives, or fails to give, in support of the ethical position she (he) is seen to be taking. Diamond writes, "For none of the commentators does the title of the story have any particular significance in relation to the wounded animal that the story has as its central character. For none of the commentators does the title of the story have any significance in how we might understand the story in relation to our own lives, the lives of the animals we are" (49). For none of the commentators does the central character of the story provide a mirror onto what they (we) share with every living being, human and nonhuman. In the context of these two readings, Diamond introduces the concept of deflection, which she draws from the work of Stanley Cavell. Deflec tion, Diamond proposes, is a conceptual strategy for dealing with a difficulty of reality. It occurs "when we are moved from the appreciation, or attempt at appreciation, of a difficulty of reality to a philosophical or moral problem apparently in the vicinity" (57). In other words, deflection converts a difficulty of reality into an intellectual difficulty and treats it as such through abstraction?that is, through the distancing practices of conceptual categorization, representation, analysis, and argumentation. The commentators whose essays are included in The Lives of Animals engage in deflection when they do not see Elizabeth Costello's woundedness?do not even see her at all?or the significance of her woundedness. Through deflection, they distance themselves from her woundedness, from any possibility of identification withher vulnerability, from any possibility of bridging the distance between self and other. They treat the novella as Coetzee's rather too obvious and (in their view) clumsy device for positing a philosophical position on animal rights. One commen tator?notably, the animal rights philosopher Peter Singer?suggests that Coetzee frames his lectures as fiction in order to maintain a safe distance</page><page sequence="9">Lynn Worsham from the position he is seen to be taking so as to avoid having to take responsibility for it. Singer, and to various degrees all the commentators, convert the difficult reality of Elizabeth Costello's woundedness, which they do not see as such, into an intellectual difficulty regarding the rights of animals. Implied in Diamond's reading, but in no way made explicit, is the insight that the commentators take Coetzee to be engaging in the distancing act of deflection and that his posture precisely mirrors their own. Deflection, Diamond suggests, represents the "capacity to miss the suffering of others"?for example, Costello's woundedness, our own woundedness?and "the possibility of our own suffering being unknown and uncared about" (68). The "categorial distinctions" mentioned earlier that we take to be nominal and descriptive?such as "man" or "the animal"?are products of and part of the operation of deflection, in that such distinctions move us from attention to the unsubstitutable singularity of the individual living being before us to the category that that being is taken to represent. There is sacrifice happening in this move and the logic of substitution. In her reading of the novella, Diamond thematizes something else the commentators miss: Costello's reluctance to engage in academic debate with various members of her audience who are keen to press her to defend the position she is seen to be taking with regard to animals and animal rights. Diamond explains Costello's reluctance in this way: "Our reliance on argumentation is a way we make unavailable to ourselves our own sense of what it is to be a living animal_To think of Coetzee's lectures as contributing to the 'debate' on how to treat animals is to fail to see how 'debate' as we understand it may have built into it a distancing of ourselves from our sense of our own bodily life and our capacity to respond to and to imagine the bodily life of others" (53). Argumentation and deflection take us out of our vulnerable and mortal animal bodies; they are practices that move attention away from exposure to the difficult reality of bodily life and death. Whereas the exposure to a difficulty of reality exceeds our conceptual repertoire and is experienced and known only in the body as a form of embodied knowledge, argumentation and deflection move attention to a kind of thinking done with concepts and categories and positions taken and defended?that is, to a kind of thinking identified as abstract and exclusively human. Our habitual recourse to argumentation</page><page sequence="10">jac and deflection in response to exposure to a difficulty of reality serves effectively as an assertion of the superior value of the life of the (human) mind and a kind of knowledge that is abstract. If, as Costello says, "there is no limit to the extent to which we can think ourselves into the being of another. There are no bounds to the sympathetic imagination," Diamond would offer that deflection and argumentation are the limits imposed by a certain kind of thinking on our capacity to imagine and respond to the lives of others, including the suffering of both human and nonhuman animals (Coetzee 35). Rhetoric understood as the theory and practice of persuasion, of effective argumentation, is the art of deflection par excellence. At this point, I want to link the notion of deflection to what Robert Lifton calls "false witness." I want to suggest the ways in which deflection and false witness are similar in an effort to bring into sharper focus the logic of sacrifice that is at work in both. "False witness," as Lifton explains it, refers to both a subject position one takes up (one becomes a "false witness") and an action one engages in (one engages in "false witnessing") as a way of dealing with an experience that is traumatizing. An event is traumatizing, as both Judith Herman and Lifton point out, by virtue of its perceived power to threaten real or symbolic annihilation. Clearly, a traumatizing event is also an experience of a difficulty of reality. A traumatic experience is one that exceeds the mind's ability to grasp it, to take it in and assimilate itto existing frameworks of meaning and value?specifically, an overwhelming con frontation with the fact that I am about to die and that I am utterly helpless to prevent or avoid it.5 Shattered by this kind of traumatic encounter with one' s own potential death, an individual may react to the death encounter by violently striking out at others and thereby engage in violent actions that make one a false witness. False witness is a defense mechanism, a form of "acting out" in response to a traumatic event that displaces death anxiety onto others. False witness, Lifton observes, is central to most victimization: Groups victimize others, they create what I now call "designated victims," the Jews in Europe, the Blacks in this country. They are people off whom we live not only economically, as is often the case, but psychologically. That is, we reassert our own vitality and</page><page sequence="11">Lynn Worsham symbolic immortality by denying them their right to life and by identifying them with the death taint, by designating them as victims. So we live off them. That's what false witness is. It's deriving one' s solution to one' s death anxiety from extreme trauma ... by exploiting a group of people and rendering them victims, designated victims for that psychological work. (Caruth 139) What Lifton describes here is a nonconscious, psychosocial process of scapegoating in which we transfer or displace or deflect onto a victim or victim-group our own death anxiety, a victim whose injury or death (real or psychological) becomes the substitute for our own vulnerability to death.6 In false witness, we deny the unsubstitutable singularity of the bodily life before us and make the bodily, psychological, or symbolic death of that victim a symbol of our power, superiority, and transcendence of the constraints of mortal existence.7 The reassertion of vitality and symbolic immortality in the face of the threat of death is simultaneously a denial of vulnerability and potential death. And this denial of death is itself numb ing?that is, psychic numbing further traumatizes the individual who engages in the denial of death through false witness. False witness is "false" in the sense of being a self-deceptive practice in relation to our own vulnerability and mortality; it is a deflection from an awareness of that difficulty of reality. It is a form of witnessing in the sense that victimizing others as a response to overwhelming trauma becomes a way of making known, or indirectly testifying, that a prior traumatic encounter with death has occurred. Having survived a traumatizing event, one has a need to bear witness and take on what Lifton calls "the survivor mission"; instead, the individual blocks out the death encounter by scapegoating others. Lifton calls false witness "a perverse quest for meaning": "What is perverse is that one must impose death on others in order to reassert one's own life as an individual and a group.... So my view is that you cannot kill large numbers of people except with a claim to virtue, so that killing on a large scale is always an attempt at affirming the life power of one' s own group" (140). In a similar vein, Girard suggests that there is always an element of delusion in scapegoating: we do not consciously know that the claim to virtue is a rationalization and that we are engaging in the kind of deflection enacted in scapegoating or false witness.</page><page sequence="12">416 jac The concept of false witness suggests that some (perhaps all) forms of violence cannot be readily traced to an innately murderous disposition (the legacy of the alleged "killer-ape" within; see Cartmill 1-14). The concept of false witness suggests that an alternative view is available to us: at least some forms of violence arise from a prior experience that is traumatizing, an experience that is overwhelming in its power to expose vulnerability and helplessness. Especially heinous acts of violence may require a long history of experiences of trauma to form the context for and solicitation of violent actions that are perversely meant to shore up potency and self-respect. In his extensive research on extremely violent, sadistic murderers, forensic psychiatrist James Gilligan finds a common experi ence among them that, in his view, provoked their violent acts: a history of experiences of crushing shame and humiliation that can only be described as profoundly traumatizing. "Soul-murder" is the term Gilligan uses to describe what these violent criminals underwent before turning to homi cide. While Gilligan's research is focused on individual criminals with a view toward articulating a theory of violence as a public health issue, his insights can be extended, for example, to understanding what many regard as the criminal history of colonialism?aided and abetted by the intersect ing forces of racism, sexism, class (or caste) privilege, heterosexism, and often theism?and their traumatizing effects on colonized subjects and cultures, perhaps explaining why these cultures, once colonialism nomi nally ends, are too often highly unstable and prone to violence of various kinds.8 What needs to be emphasized at this point in this discussion is that the situations that elicit the kind of response that might be described as false witness are not always extreme events. An example of the everyday violence of false witness that is especially relevant to animal studies: in the U.S., and increasingly in developing countries, ordinary life has been founded on, as Elizabeth Costello puts it, "an enterprise of degradation, cruelty, and killing which rivals anything that the Third Reich was capable of, indeed dwarfs it, in that ours is an enterprise without end, self regenerating, bringing rabbits, rats, poultry, livestock ceaselessly into the world for the purpose of killing them" (21). The living beings we call animals are humanity's designated victims who are brought into being to be abused and slaughtered in the interest of what we see as our superior</page><page sequence="13">Lynn Worsham 417 well-being. We live off of animals in every sense available. They are, as Costello observes, our slaves (59). Derrida makes a similar observation, arguing that for the last two centuries "we who call ourselves men or humans, we who recognize ourselves in that name, have been involved in an unprecedented transformation" in the "traditional forms of treatment of the animal" (392-94). He is referring, of course, to the same enterprise Costello points to: the industrialization of farming and meat production, animal experimentation including genetic experimentation and transfor mation, artificial insemination of animals on a massive scale, the interna tional smuggling of wild animals, and so on. To this list we might add sport hunting and fishing, the keeping of exotic "pets," and the use of animals as entertainment in film and television, zoos, wildlife theme parks, circuses, fighting contests, and sexual gratification (for example, "crush" films). Derrida offers this searing appraisal of the situation: ... no one can deny this event any more, no one can deny the unprecedented proportions of this subjection of the animal. Such a subjection... can be called violence in the most morally neutral sense of the term_Neither can one seriously deny the disavowal that this involves. No one can deny seriously, or for very long, that men do all they can in order to dissimulate this cruelty or to hide it from themselves, in order to organize on a global scale the forgetting or misunderstanding of this violence that some would compare to the worst cases of genocide. ... (394) Both Coetzee's and Derrida's use of the analogy between genocide and animal abuse and killing has been viewed as controversial (and offensive) to some who see it as a category mistake.9 For obvious reasons, I will forgo entering the debate about the factual claim of similarity or the ethical implications of this analogy. Instead, I simply want to suggest that the analogy might be usefully understood as a figure of thought that attempts to bring a difficulty of reality into focus and to convey the pain and anguish that that difficulty causes to some of us. The problem is this: how to convey the experience of a difficulty of reality, an experience that is highly individual, one that too few people experience and appreciate as such. One strategy might be to compare that difficult reality to another difficult reality (genocide, the Holocaust) that more people appreciate as mind-boggling, as beyond the limit of ethical acceptability?that is, as an atrocity. Perhaps</page><page sequence="14">418 jac the analogy is meant to make its appeal, not to reason, but to emotion and to an ethical sensibility. Perhaps the analogy offers a way of moving us into the vicinity of a difficulty of reality, a way of bridging the distance that deflection creates through its recourse to concepts and categories. If so, then the controversy over this analogy?whether it is factually accurate or ethically appropriate?may be another instance of deflection. The violent subjection of nonhuman animals has certainly become "as nothing, as the mere accepted background of life." We do not even see that their violent subj ection serves our vain attempt to deny our own vulnerabil ity and mortality, our vain attempt to claim symbolic immortality and transcendence from animal vulnerability and animal life. Wood makes an important point in his formulation of the following rhetorical question: "Might not the legitimacy of meat-eating rest, albeit precariously, not on our clear superiority to 'the animal,' but on our need to demonstrate this over and over again?" ("Thinking" 138; emphasis added).10 Meat-eating and the whole "enterprise of degradation, cruelty, and killing" of animals, on this view, has become in the last two centuries an everyday instance of false witness and a deflection from appreciating the difficult reality of our shared vulnerability with nonhuman animals. Thus far, I have been tracking a line of thinking that makes plausible my deeply felt sense that the human-animal relation, however it has varied over time and whatever forms it has taken, is also a fundamentally traumatized relation, a relation deeply wounded by the history of the animal we are, and especially so in the last two centuries. It is traumatized by the history of our problematic internal relation to our own animality. It is as if we humans cannot accept our own failed transcendence. Yet, the human-animal relation is also traumatized by the so-called animal side of the relation. For all of our prehistory and early history, the animal-hominid relation was one of predator to prey. Evidence suggests that our transition from prey to predator was only completed some 25,000 years ago, and the victory was decisively ours only since the invention of the gun. The greatest challenge, then, for the earliest hominids and early humans was to avoid, through skill or luck, becoming dinner for large and practiced predators. This primordial experience of predation is, in Barbara Ehrenreich's view, the ur-trauma in our evolutionary history: the terror of being caught unaware and suddenly felled; of being hunted, stalked, and</page><page sequence="15">Lynn Worsham 419 chased; the terror and humiliation of being captured and quickly killed or ripped apart while still alive?that is, the humiliation of being taken to be mere meat to feed another animal whose struggle for survival was precisely mirrored in our ancestors' struggle for survival.11 This experi ence of being prey, this embodied experience of trauma, was surely hard wired into our ancestors' brains and represents an evolutionary legacy to which we have no direct access. Today, it is only in nightmares, myths, fairytales, literature (including children's literature), and popular culture that we meet the predator beast?and in the mirror. In Ehrenreich's view, this original trauma of predation and the long and arduous transformation from prey to predator is restaged again and again in the collective trauma of war, which makes immediate and vividly felt the anxiety of vulnerability and the elation of potency through defensive solidarity that, she argues, "evolved in combat with a deadly, nonhuman 'other'" (96). Apart from any "reasons" given for going to war, war serves as an affective psychosocial drama that restages primordial emotions, and it has the function of producing the social solidarity?what Arjun Appadurai calls "full attachment"?that configures an "enemy" against which one human group identifies itself and moves in solidarity against another group.12 As Appadurai argues, "Full attachment, rather than coming from an authentic prior sense of shared community (whether based on language, history, soil or some other primordium), might actually be produced by various forms of violence . . ." ("Grounds" 132). Our longstanding undeclared war on animals, especially as it has taken shape in the last two centuries, arguably serves the same function as forms of interhuman violence, including war.13 Through various forms of violence against animals, we have created social solidarity and claimed for human beings what Appadurai, in a different context, calls "predatory identi ties"?that is, "large-scale group identities that seem to require ... the restriction, degradation or outright elimination of other identities"?in the case at hand, nonhuman animals (133). Furthermore, the original trauma of being prey rather than predator, and the long struggle to reverse this relation, is, in my view, the prehistory to which our penchant for violence can be traced (if only speculatively and suggestively). This original trauma may also be the evolutionary origin of our traumatized relation to our own animality, to vulnerability and mortality, and thus our deeply invested</page><page sequence="16">420 jac cultural practice of false witness, of seeking transcendence through animalizing and sacrificing those living beings we designate "Other." It is as if we cannot tolerate awareness of the difficult reality of our own failed transcendence and seek revenge on those beings we call "animal" for having the arrogance to remind us of this failure. Several things want to be said at this point in my effort to track a line of thinking that leads to an appreciation of the woundedness of the human nonhuman animal relation, to an appreciation of the prehistory and history of trauma that we share with other animals. First, the quest for meaning in life (at least for human animals) must occur, as Lifton notes, in the context of an awareness and appreciation of the difficult reality of our vulnerability and eventual death.14 "Full life power, or genuine life power," he observes, "depends upon some degree of confrontation with the idea of death, some degree of death being part of one's life, and artists have always known this" (Caruth 141). This awareness of finitude is difficult to maintain because, as Diamond observes, it wounds and panicks and isolates us. Yet, the way forward, beyond anthropocentrism and human ism to posthumanism, consists in our collective efforts to appreciate this difficulty of reality, to keep in focus this history of shared woundedness and finitude.15 Second, the history and prehistory of traumatic exposure is insufficiently thematized in much of the research and scholarship in the field of animal studies. When Jeremy Bentham changed the question from "Can animals reason?" and "Can they talk?" to "Can they suffer?" he placed on the horizon of the human conversation about animal life an awareness of the trauma that nonhuman animals suffer, though until very recently it has not been discussed specifically as "trauma."16 Third, the interdisciplinary research and scholarship on human trauma is now beginning to be employed in understanding the traumatic effects on nonhuman animals of our violent subjection of them. A recent New York Times Magazine article on post-traumatic stress disorder among elephant populations brought this news to the attention of the general public (Siebert; see also Bradshaw). Of particular relevance to this discussion are the documented instances in which elephants in the wild have not only attacked and killed humans but also raped and killed rhinoceroses. Researchers argue that elephants are suffering a kind of social trauma as a result of decades of poaching, culling, and habitat loss that have disrupted</page><page sequence="17">Lynn Worsham 421 the network of familial and social relations that historically have provided stability to elephant culture (Siebert 44; see also Gowdy). Finally, there is too little recognition of the fact that our human ways of being offer indirect testimony to the legacy of the trauma of predation. The "fight or flight" response is an obvious example of this legacy, which means it should be reinterpreted as a residual form of hyperarousal, one of the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (see Herman 35 36). Citing recent neurobiological research, Ehrenreich suggests that "the pathologies of paranoia?for example, chronic anxiety and the fear of abandonment?may all have evolutionary roots in the perpetual vigilance of potential prey" (56; see also 54). And she points to the psychiatric evidence that "panic disorders, phobias, and chronic anxiety all represent evolutionary adaptations to a dangerous environment, replete with preda tors and nonliving things such as lightning and heights" (90). Along these same lines, we might usefully redescribe false witness and scapegoating as forms of traumatic displacement and deflection as a form of traumatic dissociation, as an out-of-body experience of thought occasioned by exposure to a difficulty of reality?perhaps originally, the trauma of predation, which is perhaps indirectly restaged in any death encounter, whether real or symbolic. As Derrida remarks, "the animal looks at us, and we are naked before it. Thinking perhaps begins there" (397). On this view, deflection and the "deadening shorthand" of conceptual categories are forms of dissociated thinking that produce abstract knowledge, but abstract knowledge takes us out of the body, deflects awareness away from bodily vulnerability and death, and thereby sacrifices bodies, includ ing embodied knowledge, for the symbolic immortality offered in the life of the mind.17 The "war on pity" that, according to Derrida, has been waged against animals for the last two hundred years surely has had its casualties. The violation of animal life, he suggests, also violates the "sentiment of compassion"?that is, it damages, diminishes, and perhaps, in some individuals and groups, destroys the human capacity for empathy and sympathetic imagination (397). Indifference to the suffering of others (both human and nonhuman), then, is not in any simple sense mere "hard heartedness" or a lack of pity and compassion. It is certainly that, but indifference might also be more complexly understood as an effect of traumatic exposure. Accordingly, indifference might be redescribed as a</page><page sequence="18">422 jac form of what Herman calls "constriction" and what Lifton calls "psychic numbing"?or a profound narrowing and numbing of consciousness and perception to the point that one simply does not see the difficulty of the reality of suffering, does not see one's connection to that suffering, just as the commentators in The Lives of Animals do not see Costello's woundedness and therefore do not feel any connection to it (Herman 42 50; Lifton 500-10). To be sure, the suffering of others, especially nonhuman others, is "as nothing, as the mere accepted background of life." The denial, disavowal, and dissimulation to which Derrida refers in his indictment of our violent subjection of animals can only be achieved and maintained at a high cost to us?in particular, a diminution in, even the loss of, what Lifton calls "full life power" and what Coetzee (through Costello) calls "fullness of being." Perhaps human subjectivity, and our deep investment in a sense of individual autonomy, are an effect of traumatic repression?specifically, the repression of our dependency on and vulner ability to others.18 Millennia of employing deflection as a way of avoiding awareness of the difficulties of reality to which our ancestors were undoubtedly exposed (especially the trauma of predation) might be sufficient to evolve human subjectivity as a residue and effect of trauma. If acknowledging our shared vulnerability with animals is, as Diamond observes, wounding and isolating, perhaps overtime isolation was symboli cally refigured (and masked) as autonomy, exceptionalism, and superiority (see Herman 121). Our enduring need to demonstrate our superiority to and transcendence of animal life?our need to deny human vulnerability and mortality?leads to something that looks much like repetition compul sion, which is one of the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder: we compulsively repeat an act (deflection, false witness) in a futile effort to achieve a different outcome. In this light, anthropocentrism and humanism appear to be instances of collective reaction-formation that have served rather successfully to deflect awareness from the truth of vulnerability and fmitude. In short, I am proposing here that many of our human ways of being bear the traces of what Herman calls "complex post-traumatic stress disorder," which is a spectrum of conditions, rather than a single disorder, arising from prolonged, repeated trauma (see 119-22).19 In complex PTSD, post-traumatic symptoms become "enduring characteristics of the</page><page sequence="19">Lynn Worsham 423 victim's personality" (49). Surely the long prehistory and history of the trauma of predation left its imprint on our ancestors. I am proposing, then, the possibility that much of what we mean by "human being" or "human nature" might be understood as post-traumatic symptoms that have endured for thousands of generations, symptoms that are the legacy of our traumatic encounter with nonhuman animals. To be sure, first-world human animals?the ones who seem narcis sistically to expect everyone else to follow our lead?exist today, for the most part, in a profound state of disconnection from bodies, lives, and the earth. Disconnection, alienation, and isolation from the community of the living are the fateful consequences of traumatic exposure (see Herman 51-73). This insight, I think, motivates David Wood's suggestion that we need a "moral evolution beyond a species tribalism," one that proceeds from a recognition that "dependency?and inter-dependency?is the name of the game" ("Thinking" 143).20 In response to the undeclared war on animals, Wood calls for "a war on6 deception,' on' self-deception,' and, yes, on the ignorance that knows many things but does not connect them" (141). He calls for "a war on the culpable blindness that hides from us the sites at which compassion is pathologically suppressed" and "a war on the environmental destruction that is multiplying the occasions calling for such pity as we may still possess" (144). In 2010, the massive oil "spill" in the Gulf of Mexico, larger and more destructive than anything we humans have seen, is a deep-sounding bell tolling for each and every one of us.21 If war has the social function of restaging primordial emotions and creating solidarity?this time between and among human and nonhuman animals?then a war on deception and self-deception, on disconnection and isolation, is long overdue. What will be sacrificed are not bodies and lives but our use of concepts and categories and practices that historically have been employed in driving each one of us apart from others, making impossible a community of the living. What will be lost in this war is the logic of sacrifice itself, of false witness and scapegoating, which, as Girard argues about scapegoating in its most brutal form, is the logic of the mob (85). This war will be comprised of sundry efforts to thematize what Girard calls the "scapegoat mechanism"?in other words, efforts that make explicit scapegoating and false witness for what they are?which actually weakens the operation of these mechanisms, for they must remain</page><page sequence="20">424 jac nonconscious in order to function (115). Yet, war is not the metaphor I would choose to characterize the action that is today urgent and neces sary. My preference would be something closer to the healing arts, those arts that develop our capacity for sympathetic imagination and empathy for others, those arts that also have the potential to create and foster solidarity among the living.22 This is the context in which we offer the essays and reviews in this issue of JAC, each of which offers in its own way, and always imperfectly, an intervention in the hubris of anthropocentrism. Certainly, each piece, my own included, engages in the kind of intellectual argumentation that Diamond describes as deflection. In this respect, these essays and reviews, like all the research and scholarship in the field of animal studies and beyond, may be said to appeal to the life of the mind, to the kind of mind we think of ourselves as possessing. The lure of this reading may be irresistible, as irresistable as any rabbit hole is for those in flight. Yet, the pieces collected here also place before us, dare us not to turn away from, the difficulty of the reality of other, singular, and irreplaceable ways of being and knowing that beckon us to follow. Idaho State University Pocatello, Idaho Notes 1. Wolfe makes a potentially decisive intervention in the field of animal studies with his observation that animal studies has two possible routes of development: it may engage in a humanist practice, in which case it will remain stubbornly anthropocentric, or it may engage in a posthumanist practice and seek to overcome the tradition of anthropocentrism and humanism. He writes, "Just because a historian or literary critic devotes attention to the topic or theme of nonhuman animals doesn't mean that a familiar form of humanism isn't being maintained through internal disciplinary practices that rely on a specific schema of the knowing subject and of the kind of knowledge he or she can have" (572). He argues that if "the animal" is "taken seriously," "not just as another topic or object of study among many," then animal studies would pose a fundamental challenge to "the disciplinarity of the humanities and cultural studies," "would not so much extend or refine a certain mode of cultural studies as bring it to an end" (568).</page><page sequence="21">Lynn Worsham 425 2. In this context, it is important to note that at the same that we see unprecedented forms and frequencies of interhuman violence and violence against animals we also see the development of a multitude of industries associated with pet-keeping?not only a vast array of pet products and services as well as books and films about pets but also the professionalization of the industry of veterinary medicine. The development of these industries go hand in-hand with the intensification of the sentimentalization of pet-keeping. As Fudge points out, "A pet is a pet first, an animal second" (32). (On the topic of pet-keeping, see also Garber; Grier; Shell; Tuan.) These developments?violence (against humans and against animals), on the one hand, and on the other, the sentimentalization of pet-keeping?are not unrelated. The idea that a pet is a pet first and an animal second is a deflection (in the sense discussed in this essay) of the reality of its animality, its otherness, whichmakes the use, abuse, and killing of animals that are not pets permissible and acceptable and largely invisible?in other words, the idea that a pet is a pet first and an animal second makes possible the differential treatment of animals, some of whom are pets and some of whom are not. We sit at the dinner table and enjoy a steak while Kitty is curled up at our feet; we make no connection between our use of one animal and our different use of the other. We deflect attention from the sacrifice of the "other" animals? factory-farmed animals and animals used in scientific research, for example? through an often intensely sentimentalized attachment to our pets. See Fudge for more on our contradictory life with animals. 3. An extensive literature is available on the existence of "animal minds"? that is, on animal cognition, emotion, and moral sensibility. See, for example, Griffin and Bekoff. 4. Nussbaum, Diamond, Derrida, and Wood are among many scholars who have recently developed a focus on vulnerability. See also, for example, Butler and Cavarero. For a classic study of the denial of death in human history, see Becker. 5. Traumatic experience also rewires the autonomic nervous system and thus creates longterm physiological changes in the individual, such as a heightened startle response or a tendency to the kind of explosive anger that might lead to false witness. Trauma produces memories that are not stored in the same way as ordinary memories, which are narrativized and are easily retrievable under normal circumstances. Traumatic memories, Herman explains, lack context and a place in a coherent narrative. They are encoded in the body through vivid sensations and images and are typically elicited involuntarily in nightmares and in flashbacks (Herman 38). 6. Girard insists that scapegoating is and must be "nonconscious," a state that he differentiates from the Freudian notion of the "unconscious." In describ ing false witness as a process of scapegoating, I do not intend to conflate Lifton's notion of false witness with Girard's notion of psychosocial scapegoating. Lifton's notion of false witness operates within a discourse on human trauma;</page><page sequence="22">426 jac Girard's notion of psychosocial scapegoating operates within a broad theory of religious ritual and myth. In the context of scapegoating and the logic of sacrifice, we should also remember Burke's formulation of "the sacrificial principle of victimage," which he traces to language and its resources of substitution and to the fact that "man is a symbol-using, symbol-misusing animal" (see "Definition"; Permanence). 7. Slavery is an exemplary case of the kind of victimization that Lifton describes as false witness. In his highly influential comparative study of slavery, Patterson defines slavery as "the permanent, violent domination of natally alienated and generally dishonored persons," and he develops a view of slavery as "social death" (13). He also describes slavery as a form of "human parasitism" and details the many ways the slaveholder lives off of those he enslaves?not only physically and economically but also psychologically and symbolically. 8. See, for example, Kincaid's A Small Place, an essay that delivers a scorching indictment of the history of colonialism in the Caribbean (in particular, Antigua, her home island) and its enduring legacy of traumatic effects, especially crime, corruption, abuse, and tourism as a form of secondary colonialism. 9. Coetzee and Derrida are not the only writers who make the comparison between the massive abuse and killing of animals and the Holocaust (see, for example, Patterson's Eternal Treblinka\ Buettner). While the analogy may be controversial or even offensive to some, it is, as Wolfe points out, erroneous and misleading, "since ten billion land animals are killed each year in the United States alone for food, the vast majority of them?about eighty percent?under the deplorable conditions of factory farming" (567). 10. Wood's point about meat-eating as a form of what I would call repetition compulsion occurs in the context of a discussion of the symbolic role of animals in human life and history. His point is not about the role of meat-eating in evolution?that is, whether it contributed to the possibility of the emergence of a larger brain in humans, a topic of considerable controversy among scientists. It is perhaps worth noting in this context that the earliest direct ancestors of modern humans, the australopithecines (who lived 4.2 to 1 million years ago), were not hunters but were specialized vegetarians. Similarly, Homo habilis (emergence around 2.5 million years ago) also were not hunters, but had a diet consisting of vegetable material and leftover meat scavenged from dead animal carcasses abandoned by large predators. It is likely, in other words, that meat made up only a tiny part of the diet of Homo habilis. Neanderthals hunted and scavenged on dead carcasses. By 500,000 years ago, early humans were hunting animals for meat (see Mithen 119-20). I present this information to make the point that, contrary to popular opinion in the West, humans are not carnivores by nature. Our earliest ancestors were vegetarians; and for most of our prehistory and history, we have been omnivores, with meat occupying a relatively small part of our diet. This</page><page sequence="23">Lynn Worsham 427 continues to be true in traditional and non-western cultures; developing coun tries are shifting to a meat-based western diet and are experiencing an increase in health issues related to meat-eating and a diet high in animal protein and animal fat. 11. The neurobiological memory of this original trauma of predation may well be the source, as Steeves suggests, of our fear of being eaten and, in many cultures, the prohibition on cannibalism ("They Say" 168; see also Ehrenreich 77 96). 12. See Appadurai, Fear, "Full Attachment," and "Grounds" for more on the concept of full attachment, which is a term he coins to account for the affective side of social solidarity and which often is, in his view, inadequately understood through concepts of "loyalty" or "patriotism." With the concept of full attach ment, he attempts to account for "an order of attachment" or "a surplus of attachment" to others in one's group, nation, or territory that allows them "to kill and die in its name" ("Full" 445; "Grounds" 130). 13. As a longterm vegetarian and, more recently, a vegan, I have been puzzled by the often strongly negative reactions to these dietary practices, reactions that, at times, have seemed wildly out of proportion and deeply personal. In light of my encounter with animal studies, especially Adams' discussion of the sexual politics of meat, I now see that these dietary practices are more than a "lifestyle choice"; they also represent a radical repudiation of the social solidarity created by patriarchy, misogyny, and speciesism. A vegan commits the ultimate betrayal: a repudiation of the compact between patriarchy and speciesism. Perhaps a pre conscious awareness of this difficulty of reality explains why some individuals are so threatened by these dietary practices. 14. Contrary to the view that animals have no awareness or appreciation of death, ethologists and other observers of animal behavior have documented that a number of nonhuman animals also demonstrate an awareness of vulnerability and death, to the point of burying or attempting to bury their dead. Pliny the Elder's "Combats of Elephants" offers a graphic description of elephants' awareness of their own vulnerability and potential death and their capacity to appeal to human empathy. See also Bradshaw; Bekoff; and Gowdy. 15. As Wolfe observes, "animal studies intersects with the larger problematic of posthumanism, not in the sense of some fantasy of transcending human embodiment... but rather in the sense of returning us precisely to the thickness and finitude of human embodiment and to human evolution as itself a specific form of animality..." (571-72). His words are an important context for understanding my focus in this article on embodiment (as a sign of vulnerability and finitude), violence, trauma, and human evolution. 16. In the context of the recent turn to trauma studies to understand animal suffering, it might be useful to note that the term "post-traumatic stress disorder" was coined and the diagnosis formally recognized in 1980, which opened the way</page><page sequence="24">428 jac for the contemporary study of human trauma (see Herman). Our understanding of traumatic experience has been developed in part through the interdisciplinary field of trauma studies, which began to consolidate itself as a field in the 1990s with the study of Holocaust survivors. In my view, it is unsurprising that this extensive body of interdisciplinary knowledge is only beginning to be employed in an understanding of animals and the nature of their suffering. While some may object that the extension of this knowledge of human trauma to create an understanding of animal suffering is but another instance of anthropomorphism, I would propose that anthropomorphism in this instance is defensible, for it increases the likelihood that this understanding will lead to greater justice for nonhuman animals. See Diamond, "Eating Meat"; Oerlemans; and Daston and Mitman for very different arguments in defense of anthropomorphism. 17. In "Losing Your Concepts," which was published before "The Difficulty of Reality," Diamond employs the phrase "that great arena of dissociated thought" to describe the debate on animal rights (276). She does not link what she means by "dissociated thought" to the experience of trauma, nor does she discuss deflection as dissociated thought in the later essay. Nonetheless, the phrase, "dissociated thought," led me to think of deflection as a style of thinking that bears the legacy of traumatic exposure in dissociating the mind from the body and thereby sacrificing the body (and its vulnerability and mortality) for an investment in the symbolic immortality offered in the life of the mind. 18. In "Comment" Wood suggests that Derrida writes "as though he is on the brink" of developing a "historico-psycho-anthropology" that "would reveal human subjectivity as something like surplus repression..." (33). Inasmuch as repression results from trauma (in Freudian theory, childhood trauma), I am indebted to Wood for the insight that human subjectivity might be an effect of a history of traumatic experience. 19. In the controversy over what made us "human," scientists have focused on language, reason, tool-making and tool-use, hunting, meat-eating, and cook ing, among other developments, in their effort to identify the decisive factor in human evolution. I suggest we consider the role played by the trauma of predation in the evolution of modern humans, especially traumatic emotions such as terror, shame, and rage. Burke depicts what I think is a likely scenario for what may play a role in human evolution in his comment on the "Eternal Enigma" of existence and nothingness, which, he says, are "equally unthinkable." Burke writes, "And in this staggering disproportion between man and no-man, there is no place for purely human boasts of grandeur, or for forgetting that men build their cultures by huddling together, nervously loquacious, at the edge of an abyss" (Perma nencelll). Kristeva makes a similar observation in the context ofthe role of fear, death anxiety, and language in the formation of human subjectivity. She writes, "when death brushes us by, depriving us of the assurance... of being ourselves, that is, untouchable, unchangeable, immortal,..." we turn to "metaphorizing to</page><page sequence="25">Lynn Worsham 429 keep from being frightened to death" (38). In these passages, both Burke and Kristeva point to an awareness of vulnerability and a corresponding fear and anxiety about vulnerability that move us into language as a defense mechanism against these overwhelming emotions. 20. In the context of the call for a recognition of dependency and interdepen dency as the name of the game, I want to acknowledge the students in my senior seminar, "Beyond Speciesism: The Human-Animal Encounter," spring 2010. A successful course always depends on students willing to make the journey. All the students in this course were especially good-humored in working through some difficult theoretical readings that posed a serious challenge to the dominant way of life in Idaho, which largely revolves around sport hunting, fishing, and meat-eating. I especially want to recognize and thank Sarah Rick, Samantha Hunn, Emma Hysell, and Joseph Liljenquist for their smart questions and keen insights into our exploration of the human-nonhuman animal relation. They made the journey worth the cost of questioning some of our most cherished conceptual habits. 21. A "spill" is easily and quickly cleaned up, and recovery from a spill is also easy and relatively effortless. As in "spilled milk," a spill has no serious or lasting consequences. Not so with the BP oil disaster. In addition, when we are admonished "not to cry over spilled milk," we are admonished not to cry over things we cannot change. In the context of the BP disaster, the use of the term, "spill," especially in the initial weeks after the disaster, represents a deflection of the difficulty of the reality of this disaster and its horrific consequences for habitats and their inhabitants. This word-choice also lends a kind of inevitability to this disaster and perhaps others in the future, since our remorse cannot change the outcome. The phrase, "deep-sounding bell," is a recurring motif in Roy's novel, The God of Small Things, which presents a powerful critique of Western colonialism and neocolonialism, a critique that in part arises from an equally powerful environmental ethic. In her novel, the phrase alludes to the well-known poem by John Donne and perhaps also to Ernest Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls, which focuses on the Spanish Civil War and the threat of fascism. Donne's poem, and Roy's repeated allusion to it, memorialize our interconnectedness and interdependency and therefore our responsibility to one another, to all life, including the earth. 22. Postcolonial, African American, and women's literature have been especially useful in my own experience and, I believe, in my students' experience in developing sympathetic imagination and empathy for others, including non human animals. Certainly, the field of animal studies?especially if it develops, as Wolfe recommends, as a posthumanist discipline?has the power to develop empathy for others, all others. In this regard, it is important to note that scientists have discovered the neurobiological basis for empathy in mirror neurons found in the prefrontal cortex of the human brain. These neurons were originally</page><page sequence="26">430 jac discovered in the laboratory in macaque monkeys (see, for example, Rizzolatti and Sinigaglia; Iacoboni). Mirror neurons have also been found in other species of animals and are thought to be the neurobiological basis for empathy in some nonhuman animal species (see Bekoff). The task now is to assume our specifically human obligation to develop and extend empathy and social justice to all. Works Cited Adams, Carol J.
