<plain_text><page sequence="1">A BRONZE HEAD OF THE LATE IRON AGE FROM THE LEVANT Prudence Ο. Harper The Metropolitan Museum of Art The small bronze head which is the subject of this note dedicated with respect and affection to Ruth and David Amiran entered the collection of The Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1889 as a gift of Mrs. Lucy W. Drexel (Ills. 1-3).1 Acquired by her husband, Joseph W. Drexel, a Trustee and Patron of the museum, the piece was part of a gift includ ing a variety of objects: ancient musical instru ments, coins, Arabic carved wood, engraved gems, books and manuscripts and Egyptian antiquities.2 The works in the last category lacked, for the most part, any precise information concerning original source or provenance. Initially, the bronze head, described only as "a man of Semitic type", entered the collection of the Department of Egyptian Art. There it stayed until 1955 when it was transferred without comment to the newly-established Depart ment of Ancient Near Eastern Art. Since 1955 the bronze sculpture has remained largely unnoticed, a source of puzzlement and an object for which no close parallels, in form or style, seemed to exist. Recently, the reexamination of this miniature bronze sculpture and the publication of a find made in 1982 at Umm Udheinah in Jordan have pro vided new information suggesting a date and prob able provenance for this finely-worked object. The dimensions of the bronze head are small: 4.4 cm high and 3.9 cm at the widest point between the tip of the nose and the greatest extension of the hair mass. Viewed from the front, the face is some what triangular in form, tapering from the forehead and high cheekbones to the chin. Small ears project on either side of the face; the eyes are wide ovals slightly protruding from the face; the lips of the small narrow mouth are full and the chin rather pronounced. The most noticeable feature in profile is the large aquiline nose. On the crown of the head wavy strands of hair radiate out from a central cylinder formed by a double ring. Trimmed short at the top of the neck, the hair is further articulated by small curls which are barely visible on the curved underside of the mass. Across the forehead is a plain band in relief, probably also a part of the hair arrangement, although the surface is not artic ulated. 111. 1. Bronze head.

Profile of the bronze head in the Metropolitan Museum 111. 3. Bronze head in the Metropolitan Museum viewed from above The head is a thin hollow casting. At present, a modern core of sulphur-rich material fills the inte rior, an addition inserted to hold a brass pin mount in place in the neck.3 The earliest museum photo graphs show the head mounted in this fashion and thoroughly cleaned, stripped of all corrosion. At the tear ducts there are two small holes on either side of the bridge of the nose, faults, perhaps, in the original casting. Otherwise the condition of the piece is good. In determining the date of the bronze head the most significant feature is the distinctive arrange ment of the hair. This short, trimmed style in which a pattern of small curls appears at the end of wavy strands is comparable to the hair style depicted on many Achaemenid monuments. It is a style that was widespread from the 6th to the 4th or 3rd century BCE in Iran and beyond the borders of that country, in Mesopotamia, the Levant and Egypt. The precise form of the hair mass on the bronze head is more mannered and angular than on most Achaemenid Persian works of art, but a provincial Achaemenid object recently found in Jordan at Umm Udheinah provides a close parallel for the head in the museunTs collection (Ills. 4-5).4 In a tomb excavated in 1982 at this site, which is west of Amman, a group of objects dated between the 8th and 5th century BCE was found. One of the most interesting of the finds was a bronze incense burner supported by a female figure whose hair is arranged in 'Persian' style. Wavy strands of hair radiate from a circular ring holding the stem of the incense container. On the underside of the hair mass, curls are represented within a grid pattern. Above the forehead of the figure found at Umm Udheinah an undefined band, probably of hair, rises toward the crown of the head. The physical appearance of the female head found at Umm Udheinah differs in some respects from the bronze head in the Metropolitan Mu seum. The face of the female censer support tapers toward the chin but is generally broader and more rounded in form than the head in the museum's collection, and the pronounced nose of the bronze figure found in Jordan is less subtly formed and aquiline in profile. The eyes are simply-defined, flat ovals, lacking the subtle modelling apparent on the head in the Metropolitan Museum. These distinc tions between the two objects suggest that they come from different workshops, but there can be little doubt that Achaemenid Persian forms and models lie beneath both works of art.</page><page sequence="3">A BRONZE HEAD OF THE LATE IRON AGE FROM THE LEVANT 37* 111. 4.

Detail of the bronze censer support figure found at Umm Udheinah. Photo from La voie royale, 9000 ans d'art au royaume de Jordanie (n. 4) The figure supporting the Umm Udheinah cen ser is unquestionably a female and it is probable, although not certain, that the beardless head in the Metropolitan Museum is also intended to be a representation of a woman rather than a man.5 Although the Persian hair arrangement that served as the prototype for the two bronze sculpures is best known in Achaemenid art from the stone and terracotta reliefs of bearded males from Persepolis and Susa, three sculptures of beardless heads in the round, having the hair arranged on the head in the same fashion, have recently been identified as fe r*</page><page sequence="4">38* PRUDENCE O. HARPER males. One of the heads from Susa, may be pre Achaemenid in date;6 the two other heads are from Persepolis and Masjid-i Solaiman and are works of the Achaemenid and post-Achaemenid periods.7 More certainly female is a full-length figure carved in relief on a Tura limestone plaque in the Brook lyn Museum.8 The coiffure depicted on the relief, which was made in Egypt, is a variation of the same Achaemenid mode. The double ring support at the top of the mu seum's bronze head is related to the function of the piece and sets the sculpture apart from the category of standard votive figurines. The ring may have held a rod supporting a censer of the same type as the Umm Udheinah bronze or some other ceremo nial object. Before the discovery of the bronze censer in Jordan, Roger Moorey postulated a simi lar function, as censer or vessel supports, for a group of caryatid stands dating from the early 7th century BCE.9 No information has been published concerning the methods used for the manufacture of these stands or for the Umm Udheinah bronze, so it is difficult to assess the significance of the fact that the head in the Metropolitan Museum is hoi low cast. This technical detail may argue in favor of some other use for the object, perhaps as a figural vessel or container rather than a support.10 How ever, the position of the human head on figural vessels is invariably in line with the axis of the body, while on the Metropolitan MuseunTs piece, the attenuated neck projects at an oblique angle if the head (incorrectly mounted at present) is rotated clockwise so that the rim of the double ring element is parallel with the ground line. This angle would have made the insertion of an applicator through the head and neck into the body awkward and difficult. At present, therefore, it seems most likely that the head in the museum's collection is a sup porting element rather than part of a figural con tainer.11 Typical of certain human representations in the art of the ancient Near East and Egypt are two other features of the miniature bronze head, the long, slender neck and the aquiline nose. Sketches of heads drawn onto a fragmentary steatite con tainer, probably of the first millennium BCE, from Tell Tayanat, a site on the plain of Antioch (111. 6),12 have similarly extended necks and prominent 111. 6. Fragment of a steatite vessel reused by a draughts man for sketches, Tell Tayanat, Turkey; Oriental Institute Museum, University of Chicago, Acces sion No. A27814 noses, and the same features appear on the images of tributary figures on the base of the sculpture of Darius found at Susa.13 The heads of the kneeling males carved in sunken relief on this sculpture illustrate the position in which the head in the museum's collection should probably be viewed, turned so that the attenuated neck is not vertical but projects at an angle. The objects cited above in comparison to the bronze head in the museum's collection come from western Asia, notably the Levant and from Egypt. In balance, the evidence points to the ethnically varied and artistically rich environment of the Syro-Palestinian world as the most probable place of manufacture. There are no really close parallels for the piece among artifacts preserved from the Late Period in Egypt.14 The date at which the minia ture sculpture was made must be late in the Iron Age, but whether the head belongs to the Achae menid or post-Achaemenid period is difficult to establish in the absence of firmly dated works that are directly comparable. Although small in scale,</page><page sequence="5">A BRONZE HEAD OF THE LATE IRON AGE FROM THE LEVANT 39* the head is important as it belongs to a relatively small corpus of fine and skillfully made works of art that illustrate the presence of Achaemenid Persian influence in the eastern Mediterranean world. NOTES 1 Acc. No. 89.2.618; Gift of Mrs. Lucy W. Drexel. Elemen tal analysis on the corroded surface of the metal by energy dispersive spectrometry was done at the Metropolitan Mu seum by Mark Wypyski and Robert Koestler: Copper - 87.69b; Tin - 1.89b; Lead - 10.59b. The head came to the museum mounted on a brass pin held within the head by some material rich in sulphur. This mount holds the head in an incorrect position as stated in the text of this article. Almost certainly the upper rim of the double ring support should be horizontal and parallel to the ground line. The neck then slants at an oblique angle. 1 W.E.
