<plain_text><page sequence="1">Evolution, 60(10), 2006, pp. 2182-2183 ANNOUNCEMENTS THE SOCIETY FOR THE STUDY OF EVOLUTION BLACKWELL TO PUBLISH EVOLUTION I am pleased to announce that the Society for the Study of Evolution has entered into an agreement with Blackwell Pub- lishing to publish Evolution for the next five years. In addition to being financially advantageous to the Society, this new part- nership will allow significant enhancements to the journal that will benefit members, authors, and readers. The journal is being completely redesigned both inside and out, a new manuscript tracking system is being implemented for the review process, and a new website is being developed to facilitate discussion of and education in evolutionary topics. More information on these changes will follow in future issues. Significant changes that authors should be aware of now, however, include the following: Cover illustrations.--Each issue will feature a full-color pho- tograph/illustration related to one of the articles in that issue. Authors are encouraged to submit artwork for consideration. Preference will be given to visually striking and appealing art, which may include photographs, computer-generated graphics, and digital reproductions of paintings and illustrations. Cover artwork may be abstract or realistic. Color graphs and figures.-To encourage the full use of color in the journal, color graphics within articles will be published in the online version of the journal free of charge to the author. In addition, the Editors will grant a partial or full waiver of color charges in the print version for at least four articles in every issue. Instructions for color graphics will be posted on the journal website. Online accepted and online early.-The author's final version of an accepted manuscript will be posted online, in manuscript form, soon after acceptance. In addition, manuscripts with full HTML markup, including links to references and supplemental online material, will be posted on the journal's OnlineEarly site before final publication. LaTeX.-Beginning January 1, 2007, manuscripts, including the final version, may be submitted in LaTeX. Posting of reprints on author websites.-The Society's agree- ment with Blackwell Publishing prohibits authors from posting reprints on an author's website for one year. However, authors will be provided a link to their article on the journal website that they may post and that anyone may utilize. Authors will also be provided a PDF offprint of their articles. We hope that authors will find these changes beneficial. Mark D.

NESCENT CALLS FOR PROPOSALS The National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent) is now accepting proposals for postdoctoral fellows, sabbatical scholars, working groups, and catalysis groups. The deadline for proposals is December 1, 2006. For more information, please go the following website at http://www.nescent.org/ proposals/.</page><page sequence="3">Evolution, 60(10), 2006, p. 2184 INSTRUCTIONS TO AUTHORS The journal Evolution publishes articles in all areas of evolutionary biology. We welcome manuscripts presenting significant and original results that extend our understanding of evolutionary phenomena and processes. Papers follow several formats: Regular papers report either important additions to evolutionary theory or methodology, or careful empirical studies that bear on significant questions in evolutionary biology. They should include an abstract that summarizes the results and their implications. Demonstrating a well-established phenomenon in another taxon or context may fall short of being acceptable. Similarly, papers that simply apply existing models are less likely to be accepted than those that materially extend our understanding or provide practical applications. Perspectives express new points of view or set out speculations based on a scholarly review of recently published works. They must go beyond the works being reviewed and include discussions of new directions, new syntheses, and/or resolutions to old questions. Perspectives will normally be solicited, but authors may submit proposals to the Editor. Reviews are papers that survey recent developments or major advances in an emerging discipline within evolutionary biology. They must be of interest to a broad audience and should highlight future directions in the field. Brief Communications are short papers reporting new data or ideas. They should be 15 or fewer typed pages (including literature cited) and include up to two figures and two tables. They should include abstracts no longer than five percent of the paper's length. Comments are short papers referring to papers recently published in Evolution that contain new analyses, corrections, criticisms, or alternative interpretations of the data in these papers. They should start with a summary sentence or two and strive to be concise. Book Reviews evaluate recently published books or monographs and set the reviewed work in the context of the field. Book Reviews are normally solicited, but aspiring reviewers may propose writing a review to the Book Review Editor. Manuscript preparation.-Manuscripts must be in English. Manuscripts follow The Chicago Manual of Style, The CBE Manual for Authors, Editors, and Publishers, and the style and format of recent articles published in Evolution. The names of journals in the Literature Cited section must be abbreviated according to BIOSIS. Do not hyphenate words at the right margin or justify the right margin. Footnotes to text should be avoided; they can usually be included in the text (parenthetically if necessary). All tables (including appendices) must be double spaced. Do not separate tables from their footnotes. Mathematical expressions must be clearly typed; leave two blank lines before and after each equation. Illustrations, when published, will be reduced to a maximum of 88 mm (single column) or 180 mm in width and 230 mm in length; calculate line thickness and symbol sizes accordingly. Figure legends must be double spaced. Submission instructions.--Manuscripts should be submitted via the following web site: http://evolution.allentrack.net. Before submitting, gather the following information: contact information for all authors, including first names, middle names/initials, last names, addresses, work telephone numbers, and e-mail addresses; title; running title; abstract; key words; and manuscript files in Word?, WordPerfect?, Text, or RTF format. Detailed submission instructions are on the web site. If you have questions regarding your submission, contact the Editorial Office. If electronic/web submission is impractical or impossible, authors must submit the cover letter, manuscript, figures, and tables as both files (on PC diskette or CD) and as paper copies to: Evolution Editorial Office, School of Life Sciences, Box 874501, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287-4501, USA (E-mail: evolution@asu.edu; fax: 480-965-8353). The editorial office will upload the disk onto the online system. After a paper has been reviewed by the Associate Editor and outside reviewers, the Editor will decide whether to accept or reject the paper. Acceptance is based on the quality of the work and writing and significance of the article to our understanding of evolution. Each paper must stand on its own merits and make a substantial contribution to the field. Authors of accepted papers will be asked to send both a hard copy, including tables and camera-ready figures, and an electronic version of the accepted manuscript to the Editorial Office. Long appendices or supplementary data will be archived online, unless it is critical that the data appear with the printed article. The URL for accessing this supplementary data will be added by the publisher. This material should be included in a separate section. If references are cited in the online material, please prepare a separate bibliography for the supplemental material. At the top of the online material, please include the manuscript title and authors' names. References in the text to the online material should state parenthetically: "See Appendix/Supplementary Material available online." Underlying research data is expected to be made available to the scientific community. Any impediments to data sharing should be brought to the attention of the editors at the time of submission. Data storage.-We require authors to submit DNA sequence data to GenBank and phylogenetic data to TreeBase. Statement on authorship.-Authorship of a paper carries with it responsibility as well as credit. All those whose names appear as authors should have played a significant role in designing or carrying out the research, writing the manuscript, or providing extensive guidance to the execution of the project. They should be able to present and defend the work in a public forum. Honorary authorship is to be avoided. All authors must be in agreement on both the submission and full content of any article carrying their names. Any violation of these conditions represents academic misconduct and will be dealt with accordingly. Page and other charges.-Authors are billed $55.00 per printed page. Each member of the Society for the Study of Evolution is entitled to publish up to 12 pages per year free of page charges. Authors with research grants are expected to pay page charges. Page charges are mandatory for papers over 12 printed pages in length. In addition, authors will be billed mandatory charges of $3.15 per change for excessive changes (more than 10) on proofs. Proofs must be corrected and returned to the Editorial Office within 48 hours of receipt via express courier service. Late proofs may cause a paper to be delayed to a subsequent issue. Reprints are ordered from the printer on forms provided with proofs. 2184</page><page sequence="4">PHILOSOPHERS ? HOW MORALITY EVOLVED FRANS DE WAAL Primates and Philosophers How Morality Evolved FRANS DE WAAL Edited by Stephen Macedo k Josiah Ober "It's the animal in us," we often hear when we've been bad. But why not when we're good? Primates and Philosophers tackles this question by exploring the biological foundations of one of humanity's most valued traits: morality. In this provocative book, primatologist Frans de Waal argues that science has exacerbated our reciprocal habits of blaming nature when we act badly and labeling the good things we do as "humane." Science insists that we are moral by choice, not by nature. Citing remarkable evidence based on Why we are moral by nature his extensive research of primate behavior, de Waal explains how we evolved from a long line of animals that care for the weak and build cooperation with reciprocal transactions. The author demonstrates a strong continuity between human and animal behavior. In the process, he also probes issues such as anthropomorphism and human responsibilities toward animals. "Frans de Waal is the perfect guide to the emerging data on moral-like behavior in animals. Strengthened by deep sensitivity to the complexity of social relations and by a strong defense of anthropomorphism, this book shows how evolutionary biology can contribute to moral philosophy not merely through general principles, but by specific phylogenetic comparisons. It is a major advance in the socialization of ethology." -Richard Wrangham, coauthor of Demonic Males: Apes and the Origins of Human Violence University Center for Human Values: Stephen J. Macedo, series editor Cloth $22.95 0-691-12447-7 The Altruism Equation Seven Scientists Search for the Origins of Goodness LEE ALAN DUGATKIN In a world supposedly governed by ruthless survival of the fittest, why do we see acts of goodness in both animals and humans? This problem plagued Charles Darwin in the 1850os as he developed his theory of evolution through natural selection. Indeed, Darwin worried that the goodness he The untold story of a controversial theory observed in nature could be the Achilles heel of his theory. Ever since then, scientists and other thinkers have engaged in a fierce debate about the origins of goodness that has dragged politics, philosophy, and reli- gion into what remains a major question for evolutionary biology. The Altruism Equation traces the history of this debate from Darwin to the present through an extraordinary cast of characters. For the first time, Lee Alan Dugatkin brings to life the people, the issues, and the passions that have surrounded the altruism debate. Readers will be swept along by this fast-paced tale of history, biography, and scientific discovery. "This wonderfully written book tells the history of a conceptual revolution in evolutionary biology that fundamentally changed the way scientists think about behavior. Although I do have a slightly different perspective here and there, I enthusiastically recommend this book to everyone who wants to understand the evolutionary roots of altruism and family. This fascinating book is a page-turner for scientists and lay persons alike."-Bert H6lldobler, author (with Edward O. Wilson) of the Pulitzer Prize-winning The Ants Cloth $24.95 0-691-12590-2 LEE ALAN DUGATKIN The Altruism Equation Seven Scientists Search for the Origins of Goodness I</page><page sequence="5">UNITEDSTATES Statement of Ownership, Management, and Circulation POSTAL SERVICEr (Required by 39 USC 3685) 1.Publication Title 2.
