<plain_text><page sequence="1">BATTLE AXE OR CULT AXE?* by MARIJA GIMBUTAS, PH.D. Peabody Museum, Harvard University 73 The term 'battle axe' is applied in archxological literature to the neolithic axe with a drooping blade (fig. i). Since the appearance of these axes coincides with the cultural change, which is assumed to have been caused by the migrations of peoples, they have been inter- preted as the weapons of a warlike people, or of the 'Indo- Europeans.' Because of the frequent finds of 'battle axes' in male interments, the terminal neolithic cultures of northern and eastern Europe have been designated 'Battle-axe cul- tures'; the same term is used by the majority of European archceologists in many languages. Were the neolithic axes, and the axes of later prehistoric periods as well, weapons or rather tools and religious sym- bols? Are we right in using the term 'battle axe' for the Late Neolithic axes, distinguishing them from the other axes of the preceding and succeeding periods? Distribution of Neolithic Polygonal Axes and Axes with Drooping Blade Symmetrical, polygonal, plain or decorated axes are fre- quent in the Early and Middle Neolithic in the First Northern culture, in the Vucedal, Mondsee and Altheim cultures in central Europe, in the Glina culture of Tran- sylvania and the Rinaldone of central Italy. Such an axe is also found portrayed by Danubian farmers on late spiral- meander pottery sherds. The double-edged axes on the late spiral-meander pottery in Bohemia were doubtless imita- tions of iEgean metal axes of ?2,800-+2,400 B.C. (Neustupny, IPEK, 1936-193 7, pp. I6-3 1). In the neolithic and later Mediterranean world the double axe was one of the most frequent religious symbols, where it was based on the stone pillar or bull's head, decorating the palace, or depicted on tombstones and pottery.

During the Late Neolithic they spread over the whole of eastern and northern Europe. Both shapes of axe are extraordinarily frequent among the archaeological remains of central and northern Europe. Central Russian Balanovo culture, were of miniature size (fig. 2). Axes decorated with symbols appear in central and north Europe in the Middle and Late Neolithic (First Northern, Globular Amphorae, Salzmiinde, East Baltic-Central Russian culture) (figs. 3, 4). In the Bronze Age metal axes Most probably the polygonal or double-edged axes came gradually to northem Europe through the medium of the first agriculturalists, the Danubians, in the Early Neolithic. The axes with drooping blade came to eastem and northem Europe from the south-east in the Late Neolithic. The distinctive shape of these axes seems to be confined to the particular time and cradle of their dispersion. But there is no evidence that the polygonal stone axes, preceding in northem Europe the axes with drooping blade, played a different part in daily use and in religion. The stone axes seem to have had the same significance as the flint axes. Both the flint and the stone axes were dis- covered in hoards, in bogs and in graves as the equipment of male interments. They have frequently been found in particular positions, for instance, standing with the edge upwards or surrounded with stones (cf. Schwantes, I939, pp. 27If). In eastem central Europe the Globular Am- phore people of the Middle Neolithic equipped their male dead with axes of banded flint and with double-edged stone axes or miniature amber axelets. Evidence for the Significance of the Axes in Religion The axe is a tool of particular importance throughout prehistoric and historic times. From the neolithic period on- wards axes are distinctive for their perfection of form and rather frequent ornamentation which is not found on other tools of daily use. A certain number of axes-both double- edged ones and those with drooping blade-were made in amber, clay or precious stone such as nephrite and jadeite. Certainily these could not have been used as tools or weapons. Both the amber axelets, of the type from the Baltic area belonging to the Globular Amphorae and Late Passage Grave cultures, and the axes made in clay, from the were especially richly decorated with circles, wheels, suns, spirals, snakes, and heads or figures of elks, bulls, horses or water birds (cf the central and north European Middle and Late Bronze Age axes, called by German archaologists Prunkdxte). Miniature and decorated axes in silver, bronze, iron and precious stone were distributed over a wide area of Europe; they are seen in the Late Bronze Age and Iron Age of the Caucasus, and in the Villanovan and Hallstatt cul- tures in southern and central Europe; they occur also in the Roman period and in the Celtic, Germanic, Slavic, Baltic and Finno-Ugrian lands of the later Iron Age phase, where they are continuous throughout the historic times attested by written records. The rock engravings characteristic ofthe Pontic and ofthe Scandinavian Bronze .Age are of great importance for an understanding of the part which the prehistoric axe played in religion. In them axes have been depicted as held by male figures with upraised arms, usually ithyphallic, some- times with a he-goat's or bull's head, or depicted separately with helves (fig. 5) (cf. the studies by Almgren, I934, 1939; Adama van Scheltema, I936; Schwantes, 1939). The axes were engraved in a similar fashion on neolithic graves, on :. : . .... . . ....... .. . _ 'i - ::.: . . . .. ........:. *.. ........ . -. . .. ... . : : :: : . .: .. (a) (b) (c) FIG. I.

With the help of historical data as well as the customs and art of present-day peasants, we may gain a more exact in- sight into the meaning of the axe used as a symbol on pre- historic monuments. The axe is laid under the bed of the woman in labour, on the threshold of a door over which the newly wed couple fields, blade side up, or was thrown toward the sky, to pro- tect the crops from hail. And in ancient Greece, according to Pallatius (I, 35, I), axes stained with blood were held in upraised hands. Even in the nineteenth century Lithuanian peasants equipped their dead with an axe for the purpose of protection against evil powers, and the axe was generally believed to be one of the best weapons for defence against devils. Hundreds of examples in folk beliefs demonstrate the important role of the axe in the religious creeds of the peasants. The gable of the farmer's house was sometimes ornamented in northern Europe (in the Baltic area, espe- cially in Lithuania) with two wooden axes. Two axes asso- ciated with a wheel have been used as decorative motifs in old churches up to the present day (e.g. to my knowledge in the church of Amelungsborn near Bremen, Germany). The axe in religion is attributed to the male deity of the sky: the Baltic Perkunas, Slavic Perun, Finnish Pirgele, Germanic Thor, Roman Jupiter Dolichenus, Hittite Teshub, etc., who holds the power of procreation, stimu- lating human, animal and natural life, and having the pro- tective power against all evil.' The anthropomorphic figure of the sky god usually holds an axe or a bolt of lightning in the hand. When the thunder is heard, the Lithuanian farmer says: 'Perkiinas, the sky god, is coming. Wheels are striking fire.' He comes in a two-wheeled chariot, drawn by a he-goat, holding an axe in his upraised hand. We meet with a very similar conception of the sky god in the ancient Near East, in the Mediterranean area and among the European peoples of the historic era. The Syrian-Anatolian sky-god statuettes of bronze from the period between the middle of the second millennium B.C. and c. 700 B.C. were exported to northern Europe. This is shown by a statuette found in Lithuania (Sernai, Klaipeda district, near the Baltic Sea coast). has to step, and on the stable threshold which the cows have to cross, as protection against their failing to calve or to give milk. When a storm comes, the farmers of northern Europe drive the axe into the door post of the house and leave it there till the storm is over (this practice is attested in Ger- manic, Baltic and Slavic folklore). According to Bohemian records of the sixteenth century, the axe was set up in the The axe depicted alone visibly expresses the forceful and vital energy of the sky deity. Among other symbols of the geometric 'circle' family, such as the wheel, the concentric circle, the sun, the moon, etc., the axe, like the male animals, reptiles and water birds, the bull, the he-goat, the ram, the horse, the snake, the toad, the swan, and the horns, most evidently symbolizes the transmission of the '4 (a) (b) FIG. 3.

There is an inner connexion between the figures of male animals, water birds, reptiles and the axe; this connexion is attested by repeated depic- tions in peasant art of the same symbolic figures in the same places throughout prehistoric and historic times. The axe, while it was not the only life-stimulating symbol, was one of the most frequently used; it was depicted on rocks and tombstones, and was made variously of horn, stone, copper, bronze, iron and wood. The symbolic tokens of the Neolithic and later periods continuously through historic times, supplemented by authoritative sources of folk customs and folklore, make it clear that in the primitive peasant religion man constantly fought for life, which was threatened by destructive forces: death, disease, winter, sterility or childlessness, the failure of regularity in nature, the evil eye, parasites. If the year was plentiful and the crops abundant, if the youths married sooner and if no one died by unnatural death, then the farmer was happy. Wellbeing requires effort and the primi- tive farmer sought for it in his religion of existence. We may presume that the symbols incised on prehistoric pottery and other objects, the neolithic 'battle axes' and the well shaped axes, chronologically earlier and later, of stone, bronze, iron, silver, amber, clay or precious stone, all served the wellbeing of the farmer. Conclusion There is no evidence that our neolithic ancestors were constantly battling with axes. There is no trace of an axe as weapon in historic sources, in folk customs, in art or in folk- lore. The cultural change in the terminal Neolithic was caused not by the nomadic warriors carrying 'battle axes,' but by the impact of several groups of agriculturalists and cattle-raisers seeking new lands. This change was also syn- chronous with the opening of transcontinental trade in Europe in the period +I800-I700 B.C., caused by very mobile western Bell Beaker Folk and the South-Eastern Catacomb Grave People who traded in metal, amber, glass and other materials travelling across Middle Europe. Itinerant traders of south-eastern origin, trained in Cau- casian metallurgy, distributed bronze axes in the area north of the Black Sea, which evidently were imitated in stone by local cultures. The stone axe with a perforation and with a more or less drooping blade gradually superseded the double-edged axes and simple trapezoid flint axes. The name 'battle axe,' as it is used in the literature, does not characterize the function of the Late Neolithic axe. 'Cult axe' would be a more defensible name. Only in the sense of 'religious battle,' of the struggle for existence, could these cult axes be regarded as battle axes. The primi- tive tiller of the soil was deeply religious, and his religious expression ruled his life to such a degree that almost all forms of art were subordinated to it. In the life of a primi- tive farmer the axe is a tool, not a weapon. In prehistoric times it was likewise a tool, so far as we can judge from the working traces. But being a tool, it played a special part in religion. The term 'battle-axe cultures' is not a precise one. It may remain, as a matter of convenience, but its meaning must be revised. Note I Africanists will think also of Shango, the Yoruba god of thunder and procreation, whose symbol is the double axe and whose cult has been connected by Frobenius and others with the ancient Mediterranean cultures.-ED.</page></plain_text>
