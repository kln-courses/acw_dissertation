National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Museum purchase through the American Art Forum and gift of an anonymous donor I think of Wayne Thiebaud (b. 1920) as a classicist. Since the onset of his mature style in the early 1960s, he has been a renowned still-life artist, working squarely within the Western tradition of such canonical masters as Jean-Baptiste Simeon Chardin. If it weren't for his penchant for depicting cakes, candied apples, lipsticks, bubblegum ma- chines, and other subjects often associated with pop art, one would be hard-pressed to think of him as anything other than a classicist. In addition to still life, Thiebaud has painted diligently in at least two other traditional genres. Working directly from posed models in the mid-1960s, he realized an interest in portraiture, and in the late 1970s he started to focus on dramatic, formalized views of San Francisco and its hilly environs. The late California art critic Thomas Albright wrote that Thiebaud is "basically a humble practitioner working in painting's three traditional categories: still life, portraiture, and landscape." This is an admirably succinct description of an artist who, more recently, was labeled "unclassifiable" in the New Yorker. Albright's description seems uncannily poi- gnant when we consider that Jackpot Machine, an early Thiebaud newly acquired by the National Museum of American Art, embraces characteristics of all three of these tradi- tional categories (fig. 1).1 Jackpot Machine has all the trappings of the most effective Thiebaud still lifes-lush, outrageously sensuous, brushed-on oil pigment that is unmistakably the artist's own; profoundly sensitive rendering of light and color-rich shadows; and a feeling of intimacy. Though relatively large for a Thiebaud, it is nonetheless precious. Like any outstanding example of the artist's work from the early 1960s, Jackpot Machine looks best from a nose-distance away. It implores scrutiny of its strangely delectable surface. While its subject is ripe for interpretation, it is the object, the painting itself, that first commands my attention. As with most of the artist's still lifes, Jackpot Machine is fundamentally a formal exercise painted from memory. It is about the imagined behavior of light on and around an object's surface and how scale, in relation to context, can affect meaning. Thiebaud's still lifes are vitalized not so much by the "look" of the thing they depict, but by a thoroughly pondered awareness of the subject's quality as an object. Consider, for instance, Three Sandwiches, also in the collection of the NMAA (fig. 2). Three Sandwiches is not based on an acute study of sandwich meat and white bread, nor is it about eliciting hunger pangs. There is nothing tasty about hardened, even fossilized, 78 Summer 1996</page><page sequence="2">I 4' K</page><page sequence="3">sandwich bread, or meat that would have disintegrated long ago were it not for the forward-thinking chemicals that preserve it. Disengaged from the likely context of, say, a table or vending machine, the sandwiches find themselves in a barren, forgotten land- scape. A horizon line accentuates the steep rise of their elemental, pyramidlike forms. These magnificent midday snacks, waxing prosaic against a cool earth and endless sky, possess a lingering sensibility. They are not yesterday's lunch-on-the-run, but monuments to some future civilization's ancestral leftovers-the quick-grab meal that became, by This one-armed bandit wields a certain pathos. It is the only default, the sole surviving artifact of a Thiebaud still life I know that couldpossibly bite back. culture that could not spare the time. The perfectly wrapped sandwiches appeal to us not as food but, like the painting itself, as rarefied objects. Jackpot Machine also operates on a grand scale. Just as the three wedgelike objects pierce the horizon in Three Sandwiches, so too does the slot machine overwhelm its intensely foreshortened landscape. Rather than pyramidal, its ascending form, marked by increasingly smaller stages and a truncated top, evokes a ziggurat, crowned with a gleam- ing shrine to coin money. Painted in the brazenly patriotic colors of red, white, and blue, replete with stars, this temple is American rather than Mesopotamian, a monument to our nationalized mythical potential for economic transcendence. Thiebaud's technique is very much about paint. It has always depended on overtly expressive, painterly, and traditional means. This is another reason why Three Sandwiches fails to make me hungry: it is virtually impossible to see through its heavily impastoed application of paint or to bypass it for some unmediated appreciation of what the paint depicts. I know this is contrary to the way Thiebaud is usually understood. In general, the artist paints his various still-life subjects in the same signature style, but he is best remem- bered for his pictures of cakes and pies. In these particular works his sumptuous surface happens to evoke the texture and flavor of what it represents-the creamy quality of actual cake frosting, cream filling, pie topping, fruit preserves, or what have you. The artist calls this effect "object transference" to denote the symbiotic relationship between paint and what the paint depicts.2 Jackpot Machine, like Thiebaud's other less-luscious still lifes of pinball and bubblegum machines, is not susceptible to object transference. The hard, reflective surface of the depicted metal shell competes with the viscous pigment. Here paint and subject matter undermine each other's claim to illusion. The paint is not metallike, and the slot machine is more fleshy than machinelike. That Jackpot Machine was painted in the same buttery way as a strawberry shortcake elicits questions, not the quick and seemingly satisfactory responses his paintings of desserts conjure, such as, "This looks just like a cake!" The painting's fleshy surface endows the already humanlike slot machine with a strangely compelling visage. In a recent interview the artist stated that jackpot machines "represent an odd extension of the human configuration in that they have arms . .. and sort of eyes." He cultivated this anthropomorphized impression when he lived near Lake Tahoe. Thiebaud spent time in the casinos there, and slot machines were a favorite topic for sketching. The artist painted Jackpot Machine from memory sometime after the sketches.3 It depicts not only the perceived contours of the subject, but also the proclivities of the mind's eye of the one who depicted it. This still life, unmistakably redolent of human figuration, verges on portraiture. 80 Summer 1996</page><page sequence="4">2 Wayne Thiebaud, Three Sand- wiches, 1961. Oil on canvas, 30.8 x 40.9 cm (12 8s x 16 8s in.). National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Gift of the Woodward Foundation Contributing to the image's anthropomorphic qualities are its raised arm, the two gray fields marking ersatz eyes on either side of the central window, and a coin receptacle that's an orifice with a voice all its own. However, it is more than a collection of humanlike parts and a deadpan circuit-board psyche. The machine's bold and extremely confronta- tional design, nearly filling the picture frame, lends the image a menacing demeanor. This one-armed bandit wields a certain pathos. It is the only Thiebaud still life I know that could possibly bite back. The central window provides a view to the humanoid mind of the machine. Displayed there is a showcase of stopped wheels. The wheels sport pictures that barely resemble what they are meant to portray. Are those lemons, plums, cherries, and oranges? If we were to encounter them elsewhere, outside the meaningful context of the jackpot machine, would we recognize this mismatched combination as a gambler's losing effort? Were it isolated and displayed on a street sign, the lemon couldn't direct anyone to a fruit stand. The single bell at top center is the only distinctly legible symbol, adding a patriotic ring to the grid's cacophony of color and shape. This random mix of mostly nonsensical designs is 81 American Art</page><page sequence="5">exclamatory, perhaps even violent, in nature. The slot machine, with its gaping maw and arm raised in anger, rants and raves. How sweetly malevolent! This scrumptious thing-I'm referring to the luscious picture, with its cloying surface-describes a glorified toy with the character of a twelve-star U.S. general. Unlike the cakes and pies or even the pinball and gumball machines, Jackpot Machine seems alive with a palpably frightening internal dissonance. Because of the machine's bad attitude, I feel I can know it. Despite the attitude, I want to. It's not cold and impersonal, but fleshy and feisty. There is a different kind of object transference at play here than what operates in the pictures of cakes and pies. I don't desire what the picture represents any more than I crave Thiebaud's inedible sandwiches. Nonetheless, the picture, with its sensual Thiebaud facture, begs to be touched. After all, it is nearly a to-scale image of a dream machine, one that faces us head-on and invites the arm-yank response we automatically associate with it. The painting and my experience of it represent a perpetual state of deferred pleasure. One pulls the arm of a slot machine and pulls it again until it delivers something desir- able. Thiebaud's machine, however, does not dispense rewards. It is giftless, if not down- right nasty. Its main promises for pleasure are tactile and, for those of us seduced by its savory surface, perhaps even oral, the thrills inherent in the layer of skinlike paint that encases it. Nonetheless, I am willing to bet that the oil-based pigment does not feel or taste as good as it looks. The whole situation makes me sorely conscious of the so-called human predicament and my own frustrating partnership of desire and gratification. To this end, the luscious technique and the alluring subject work in concert. Thiebaud is a master artist, and Jackpot Machine a masterpiece because it is literally in control, deft in its ability to tantalize.
