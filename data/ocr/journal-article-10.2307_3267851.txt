<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews 153 It was read in reference to the generation of the flood and the generation of Sodom: "Consider the perversions (LIW) of generation and generation:' Also his choice of vocabulary sometimes misses the mark. He translates VVWD by "permeate" (p. 304); "Pore over" is better able to tell us that just as rain drops "pore over" grass so one should pore over the words of Torah. The final problem concerns the notes. Important signposts have been omitted. For example, based on scriptural words (Deut 24:1) the School of Hillel understood that either adultery or any marital difficulty on the part of a wife served as grounds for divorce (p. 263). Hammer neglects to inform us that the commentators to the Talmud and the Codes explain "3"1 nI1 was taken as " 1~n 3111. One is reminded of the Palestinian Targumim which took 1:71D nDLnn (Exod 19:6) as 1031~ M tl . Hammer does not do justice to his assertion that he has noted "especially instances where Professor Finkelstein emended the text on a basis other than the manuscript readings:' I do not recall such notes and checked Piska 335 (p. 344) where there is significant reconstruction and emendation. It is not noted. Although he provides a key to the abbreviations of manuscripts, he ignores them. I found few real references to them. They were mainly to the Oxford manuscript (coded by B, the same letter used for Babylonian Talmud). N. 9 to Piska 319 tells us that he reads t11ln. He translates this as "vulnerable":' Both Friedman and Finkelstein dismiss the prooftexted point as a gloss from the commentary of Zera Abraham (not by A. Lichtenstein as given by Finkelstein, and copied by me elsewhere, but by A. Lichtstein). The proper transla- tion of "1l'n is "permitted food" and both scholars find the interpretation of the nations consuming Israel to be too forced. N. 10 to Piska 54 again mentions the Oxford MS but I fail to see the occasion for the note as his translation follows Finkelstein. Much of the problem could have been alleviated had Hammer consulted extensive philological literature, including lexica, that deal with the vocabular of these midrashim, and had he looked at the recent German translation (1983). The author has not provided us with a brilliant edition or even with some original findings in his Introduction. The editor seems to have been asleep at the wheel. One expects more from Yale Judaica Press. Given all its problems, we wonder if there is a good use for this work. Scholars will not be able to use it uncritically, nor will students of Midrash. However, those who wish to know something about Sipre's attitudes towards a number of subjects (listed in the Index) will find it useful. There are a goodly number of accurately translated passages that warrant the purchase of the book. Yet, the frequency of gross errors precludes its serious use by the readers of this journal. There can be no doubt that this first translation of Sipre Deuteronomy into English will not be the last. The importance of this Midrash is such that it cannot be ignored by scholars in fields which are increasingly using translations of Midrash. H. W. Basser Queen's University, Kingston, Canada, K7L 3N6 The Name of God and the Angel of the Lord: Samaritan and Jewish Concepts of Inter- mediation and the Origin of Gnosticism, by Jarl E. Fossum. WUNT 36. Tiibingen: Mohr-Siebeck, 1985. Pp. xiii + 378 DM 128. Few innovations in the history of religions are more remarkable and more elusive of satisfactory explanation than the emergence in late antiquity of the anti-cosmic</page><page sequence="2">154 Journal of Biblical Literature symbol of the gnostic demiurge, that unflattering parody of the Jewish God which Hans Jonas labeled the most glaring evidence of gnosticism's "metaphysical antisemi- tism." Fossum sets out to demonstrate what Jonas denied: that Judaism itself produced this parody. The initial premise of the book is that the greatest obstacle to the theory of the Jewish origins of Gnosticism at large has been to explain how Judaism could have produced the idea of the gnostic demiurge in particular. Fossum's fundamental argument in this abridgement of his 1982 Utrecht disser- tation under Gilles Quispel is essentially a restatement of the latter's thesis that the more radically dualistic version of the gnostic demiurge is a later development, and that the first gnostic versions of the demiurge idea involved a mere "dualism of subordination" (p. 281): a "vicegerent" principal Angel of God who carried the Divine Name and the demiurgic authority and powers inherent therein. Quispel, drawing on work by H. Wolfson, argued that the gnostic demiurge derives from teachings of the Magharians, a supposedly second Temple Jewish sect. Karaite sources of the 10th century first mention the Magharians, referring to them as an extinct sect, and alleging that this sect, motivated by a concern to protect God from the anthropomor- phisms, had credited a vicegerent Angel of the Lord with the creation of the world and had also found this Angel, rather than God, in other anthropomorphisms in Scripture. Fossum agrees that such Jewish circles, with such motivations, are the place to look for the matrix of gnosticism. But the Magharians constitute a narrow evidential base, with only late attestation, and in this book Fossum has attempted to widen the base by adducing evidence from "other Jewish texts which propound the same doctrine," by which he means texts belonging to "the Samaritan branch of Judaism" (p. 19). Non-Samaritan Jewish texts have produced examples where the Angel of the Lord has the Divine Name but is not a demiurge, or examples where the Divine Name is said to be the instrument of creation, but is not an angel or personal being. Fossum's approach is to take aim on the Samaritan material, on the grounds that only here are both the demiurgic and the personalized-angelic features of the Divine Name found combined (p. 24). Fossum's richly documented study is not without some measure of success in achieving its "main objective.., .to demonstrate that the concept of the demiurge derives from Judiasm" (p. 4). He has correctly stressed the well-known, but not always appreciated, fact that not all gnostic sources are equally negative in their protrayal of the demiurge, or in their attitude toward Judaism or Jewish tradition. The evidence collected adds confirmation, if such was needed, to the wisdom of rejecting any notion of "Gnosticism as a phenomenon which was born [full-grown] like Athena"' (pp. 23-24). Fossum rightly underscores the important role that exegetical concerns-viz., anti-anthropomorphism - may have played in the emergence of gnostic demiurgic myths. And that such concerns arose first in Jewish circles is fully plausible. Generally, he wants to argue that in the origin of the gnostic demiurge, mythos preceded logos, yet Fossum does evidently see a crucial role played by philosophy, specifically Platonism: The first Gnostics were not philosophers, though they were interested in theodicy. The Platonic demiurge was "an important model,' but the first Gnostics "had a model of their own in the figure of the Angel of the Lord" (pp. 9-10). However, Platonism is credited with contributing at least the motive for this removal of God from responsibility for the creation of the world (pp. 18-19; cf. 332-36).</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 155 But Fossum's specific reconstruction of developments is vulverable to criticism on several counts: (1) Granting for the moment his arrangement of various gnostic texts according to level of negativity in the portrayal of the demiurge (e.g., pp. 218-20, from least to most negative: Justin the Gnostic- Satornil - Ophites -Hypostasis of the Archons and On the Origin of the World -Apocryphon ofJohn), it is never made clear why we should accept this incremental ascent as the historical order of development; order- ing the historical relation among such sources differently (and why not?) raises questions about Fossum's simple, one-way model of development. (2) As might be expected, the Simonian tradition plays a central role in Fossum's reconstruction. But his treatment of Simon and Simonianism is shot through with a host of questionable assumptions and hypotheses. A few examples: Fossum can only draw his conclusion about Simon Magus's similarity to the Magharians (p. 214) by relying heavily upon the Pseudo-Clementines as his source for reconstructing Simonian teaching, though the reliability of the Pseudo-Clementines as a source for Simonianism is a notoriously open question. Simon's "Dosithean provenance,"' so important to Fossum's reconstruction (pp. 74, 237), is in fact open to serious doubt. Building on what was already only a hunch by S. J. Isser (Isser called it a "guess") that the staff of Dositheus mentioned in the Pseudo-Clementines was supposed to be Moses' staff, Fossum conjectures that the fact that later Jewish and Samaritan tradi- tions speak of the Name of God inscribed on Moses' staff allows us to read the Name of God back into the significance of the staff in the Clementine legend (118). Or, if the Name of God be seen in the Ego eimi assertions of the false prophets in Mark 13:6, "we would be justified in including Simon Magus among" the false prophets: we are assured that "the author of Mark would have perfect opportunity to have knowledge of the Samaritan heresiarch" (p. 128). And so on. (3) Fossum finds vestiges of a Samaritan/Jewish Angel of the Lord both in certain "positive" revelatory figures in gnostic texts (Jesus in the Gospel of Truth, Melchizedek, Simon, etc.) as well as in "negative" entities- the demiurgic angel(s). Within one gnostic text, On the Origin of the World, Fossum tries to link three significantly different figures: the "Light-Adam" (p. 280), Sabaoth (p. 304) and Ialdabaoth (p. 313), to supposed features of the Angel of the Lord model. There is reason to be skeptical about a methodology which traces quite diverse elements in gnostic sources back to a single hypothetical antecedent, reconstructed from Samaritan and Jewish sources, most of which are in any case much later than the gnostic texts themselves. It is more likely that such parallels result from a more complex pattern of relationships between gnostic and Jewish sources. For example, the visionary ascents from the Enochic literature may well be part of the background for similar revelatory ascents in gnostic texts, but, as Fossum himself admits, Enoch is never described as a demiurge. On the other hand, as G. Stroumsa has shown, we may look to traditions in Enoch literature about the rebellious Watchers (part of the Enoch tradition which does not seem to interest Fossum) to find some of the roots of gnostic demiurgical motifs. (4) Fossum has spun out a veritable cat's cradle of "connections" among various traditions and strands of tradition that are often widely separated chronologically. (Those squeamish about "parallelomania" should be forewarned.) Our confidence in the relevance of many of these parallels is not enhanced by the author's frequent</page><page sequence="4">156 Journal of Biblical Literature readiness to help them along by paleontological reconstruction: For instance, even though "magical texts calling Adam by the Name of God do not expressly state that he received this Name upon exaltation," we are assured that "this is to be assumed,' and that this inference is confirmed by the fact that, while in 1 Enoch Enoch also is not said to have received the name of God when having been installed in heaven as the Son of Man, yet such a notion does appear in (the much later) 3 Enoch (p. 297). (5) Lastly, it is not clear just how much Fossum's reconstruction finally explains. We have always known that Jewish writers (e.g., Philo) interposed "benign" inter- mediary figures that protected the transcendence of God. The additional evidence for such viceroy figures still does not answer the crucial question of why Jews would ever have begun to see such a figure as evil. In one place, Fossum begins to argue that it was Jewish apocalypticism, with its notion of fallen angels in an originally good cosmos, which bred gnostic dualism (pp. 74-75). Then later on he comments that the history of Platonism reveals that "a degradation of the demiurge could develop as the result of a negative world view" (p. 336), although this leaves unanswered the question of why the negative world view. And in his last paragraph, he suggests that "the development of radical dualism and the anti-Jewish sentiment apparently must be accounted for by certain social dynamics,' i.e., the social conflict with opponents of gnostic movements (p. 338), but Fossum sees such issues as falling beyond the objectives of his study. Yet surely assertions that the emergence of the evil gnostic demiurge was an incremental process must ultimately turn on a careful analysis of precisely such social dynamics. Michael A. Williams University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 The Economic and Social Origins of Gnosticism, by Henry A. Green. SBLDS 77. Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1985. Pp. xv + 304. $26.95/17.95 ($17.95/12.00 for members). This work, which contains the last five chapters of Green's 1982 St. Andrew's Ph.D. dissertation supervised by R. McL. Wilson, is intended as a response to the call for a sociological analysis of gnosticism. The two central theses of the work are: (1) that the ideology of individualism embodied in gnosticism was structurally related to the trans- formation of the Ptolemaic practice of state ownership of the means of production to the Roman mode of private ownership; and (2) that certain marginal Jews in Egypt, namely those seeking upward mobility through Hellenistic acculturation and embrac- ing the new Roman spirit of privatization, but whose aims were nevertheless thwarted by a rising tide of anti-Semitism, acted as catalysts in the sectarian development of Judaism, and hence played a pivotal role in the emergence of gnosticism. Combining a sociology of knowledge and a sociology of religion, Green follows Weber's historical sociology of socio-cultural processes, but from a rather more Marxist materialist than idealist perspective. Chap. 2 describes the means of Ptolemaic production under both the Greeks and the Romans and the attendant shift from state to private ownership of property, from state monopolization of the means of production and distribution to a mixture of private initiative and state monopoliza- tion, and from central state management of economic life and revenue collection to a relatively more decentralized policy of private accountability and the imposition of taxes paid in money. It was this move towards privatization under Augustus that fostered a new kind of individual initiative and responsibility.</page></plain_text>
