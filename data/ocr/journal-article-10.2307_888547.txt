In this section too, the exhibition lived up to its promise - sometimes in a paradoxical fash- ion: certain supposed 'models' turn out not to be such, and bring out instead Chardin's profound originality; others show quite clearly the sources to which he referred, in technique as well as subject. The same goes for his 'influence', which is evident, but almost completely formal in character. Chardin, though imitated, remained inim- itable.

Florence Cecco Bravo While meticulous, traditional, sober Carlo Dolci may exemplify the Florentine Seicento, Cecco Bravo is one of its most singular artists. His paintings, with their deep, at times passionate expression, force- ful Sgures and impetuous definition with a loaded brush, represent almost a painterly inversion of the Florentine tradition of rigorous disegno (see Figs.73 and 74). Artisti- cally and historically, he is an enigmatic personality. Welcome, then, was the exhihi- tion Cecco Bravo pittore senza regola, Firenze 1601 - Innsbrack 1661, the latest in what is now a tradition of small, well-conceived, focused shows at the Casa Buonarroti, Florence (closed 30th September). It was inaugurated with allusions to the humanity, sexuality, and humour of his art and also with a sense of belated recognition. Fame indeed seems to have cheated Francesco Montelatici. His biography is inexplicably absent from Filippo Baldinucci's J%otizie de' professora del disegno and, as far as contemporary printed sources are concerned, he was for centuries known mainly from short, perceptive descriptions in Giovanni Cinelli's 1677 guide to Florence and from Pellegrino Orlandi's brief, much-repeated life of 1704. Important primary sources - Baldinucci's notes, 61nelll's and F.M.N. Gabburri's biographies - long remained unpublished.l During the early years of the rediscovery of the baroque) Cecco Bravo was not included in the important exhibitions of 1915 and 1922 in Florence, although many of his paintings travelled under others' names (a version of Fig.7 1 was attributed to Strozzi; Fig.74 was given to Ficherelli; and Fig.73 to Mazzoni, Liss, or even Fabritius). His fortuna critica rose with studies in the early l 960s by Gerhard Ewald (in this Magazine, 1960 and 1962) and Anna Rosa Masetti (1961, 1962)) and his rediscovery played a role in the reappraisal of the Flor- entine Baroque during that decade.2 In the pioneering exhibition of 1969, Howard Hibbard contrasted the 'murky sexuality' of Cecco Bravo, Furini and Pignoni, a prin- cipal tendency, with Dolci's religiosity,3 and in the comprehensive II Seicento forentino (1986), Anna Barsanti squarely placed Cecco Bravo in the mainstream; she has recently noted that late twentieth-century 72.

This first monographic exhibition - initi- ated by Pina Ragionieri and Giovanni Agosti - showed thirty-two paintings (twelve from public and twenty from private collections) and twenty-six drawings, and its catalogue presents a synthesis of recent publications, along with new attributions and new archival research.4 In the intro- duction, Luigi Baldacci evokes the artist as '7bittore senza regola', close to Giovanni da San Giovanni and Furini yet independent, resolving inspiration from classicism and . . . . . . . . mantera Wlt z a sty lStlC 1dentlty t lat 1S at once spirited, elegant and unique in its pictorial dissolution of form. Barsanti contributes a historical essay tracing Montelatici's career and patronage in later Medici Florence, which is supported by a complete appen- dix of new and published documents. She addresses questions about his quarrelsome personality (one explanation for his nick- name), the early decline of his promising career as a decorator in fresco (for the Pitti Palace and the Casa Buonarroti, as well as for churches), the paucity of religious works and suspicions of heresy, the late production of mainly easel pictures) and the problems posed by the scanty documentation for the extant paintings as well as by the numerous recorded but lost works (such as the 180 paintings listed in the 1660 inventory of his studio). Roberto Contini, in his essay and catalogue entries on the drawings (mainly lent from the Uffizi), surveys the artist as one of the most singular draughtsmen of the school, tracing the sources for his style and the meanings of works such as the mysterious 'sogni' (his drawings of dreams).

Thus, one of their achieve- ments is the defining of Cecco's artistic development from Bilivertian solidity in the 1620s (Fig.72), to a spirited manner rival- ling those of Giovanni da San Giovanni and Furini in the 1 630s and 40s (Figs. 7 1 and 75), and then to an expressive language in the 1 650s of painterly figures suffiused with an almost obliterating sfumato which suggest the influence of the late Titian via a pro- posed but undocumented Venetian sojourn (Fig.73 and 74). This overall assessment and the discussion of individual works are cer- tain to inspire debate among specialists. blueish, detailed Flemish manner of Canta- gallina7 Parigi and Allori. The artist's sense of decorum challenges our understanding of certain representations such as the ambigu- ous allegories (nos.15-17, 19, 27-28)&gt; the intention of the St Michael and angels (no.4) which seems to lack a central motif, the Roman Ghari (no. 14) wherein Cimon is uncharacteristically youthful, and the Christ with angels (Fig.74), understood as both a Gethserna7ze and a contemplative seene. Could the so-called Apollo and DapAne (Fig. 73), in which the identification seems to be contradicted by the Cupid at top left aiming his arrow, be an Abduction of Pers- ephone in which Pluto is conceived as being both brutish and youthful? If overlooked by fame, Cecco Bravo has now found rehabilitation in this exhibition, with its catalogue replete with information: one eagerly awaits future studies on him by these authors.

In addition to Pontormo, Furini, Bernini and late Titian, one suspects from works such as the St Clare (no.13) that Rubens was also a formative influence. Cecco Bravo reveals a quirky humour in details such as the six-finger passage in the early Madonna (Fig.72), the precariously placed knife and editorialising dogs in the Esau and j}cob (Fig.7 1), and the anthropomorphic frogs in the Lstona (no.9). He re-uses figures and compositions (the yudith, nos.8, 20; the Boy drinking, nos.17, 19) and returns, when appropriate, to earlier modes (the Madonna and saints, no.26, of 1655 recalling Del Sarto). His lyrical treatment of landscape, with its warm colourism and stippled brushwork (see Fig.75), seems to be a response to the 75. Landscape with ruins, by Cecco Bravo, 1630s. Panel, 27.3 by 52.2 cm.
