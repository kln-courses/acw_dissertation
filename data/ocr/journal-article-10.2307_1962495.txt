<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE RETURN TO THE STATE GABRIEL A. ALMOND Stanford University 7i'hree important questions are raised by the "return to the state" movement of recent years. First, are the pluralist, structural functionalist, and Marxist literatures of political science societally reductionist, as this movement contends? Second, does the neostatist paradigm remedy these defects and provide a superior analytical model? Third, regardless of the substantive merits of these arguments, are there heuristic benefits flowing from this critique of the literature? Examination of the evidence leads to a rejection of the first two criticisms. The answer to the third question is more complex. There is merit to the argument that administrative and institutional history has been neglected in the political science of the last decades. This is hardly a "paradigmatic shift"; and it has been purchased at the exorbitant price of encouraging a generation of graduate students to reject their professional history and to engage in vague conceptualization. Ar guments for a return to the concept of the state have been made intermittently ever since Frederick Watkins (1968) prematurely solemnized its burial 20 years ago. The writers who have advocated a return to the state have had different goals and agendas. In the cases of Nettl (1968), Stepan (1978), and Nordlinger (1981) the argument seems to be one of emphasis. The campaign carried on under the aus- pices of the Committee on States and Social Structures of the Social Science Research Council to "bring the state back in" speaks of "paradigmatic shifts" (Evans, Rueschemeyer, and Skocpol 1985). The "pluralist-functionalist" and Marxist paradigms, which are described as the waning paradigms of contemporary political science, are said to be societally reductionist, according no autonomy to state structures and politics and hence fundamentally lacking in explanatory power. The statist paradigm remedies this defect and will replace these earlier approaches. I respond to three questions raised by this polemic. First, are the pluralist, struc- tural functional, Marxist, and other lit- eratures of political science societally reductionist? Second, does the "statist paradigm" remedy these defects? Third, regardless of the substantive merits of these arguments, are there heuristic bene- fits flowing from this critique of the literature? Arguments for a Return to the State I propose to review these criticisms, and make a search of the literature to determine the extent to which this view of "mainstream" political science is sustained by evidence. I cover ground similar to that covered by G. David Garson (1974) in an article published more than 10 years ago and in a subsequent book (1978). He provided a review of the history of inter- est group theory using as his data base all of the articles and reviews which had ap- AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW VOL. 82 NO. 3 SEPTEMBER 1988</page><page sequence="2">American Political Science Review Vol. 82 peared in this Review since it began pub- lishing in 1906. He also included some 20 frequently cited books dealing with group theory. His principal conclusion was that political science "grows" largely reactive- ly, in response to outside stimuli: "the rise of economic groups, the tides of progres- sivism and disillusion, the birth and ex- citement of modem psychology," and the like (p. 1519), rather than through the self-conscious testing of analytical models. Using group theory as exemplifying this disciplinary propensity, he pointed to the early polemic between the "classic" sover- eignty and "classic" pluralist theorists. The classic theory of sovereignty over- stated its case, although if one looks care- fully at this nineteenth-century literature one will find careful qualifiers of the plenary power of the state. The assertion of the absolute authority of the state ran into the anomalies of the empirical and normative limits on state authority-both the conservative ones of religion and property and the liberal ones of the rights of association, assembly, petition, and the like. Classic pluralism similarly over- stated its case, rejecting the very notion of state sovereignty, and characterizing the state as one association among many. By denying any sovereignty whatever to the state, Laski (1917) and the other early pluralists deprived themselves of an agen- cy capable of remedying injustice and providing basic security. Garson points out that the history of political science would have been quite different if these alternatives had been formulated as ana- lytical models, as ideal types, rather than assuming that they modeled reality or that reality ought to be made to conform to them. The contemporary statists in their posing of the pluralist and statist alternatives make a similar mistake. In a more recent article Andrew McFar- land (1987) reviews the history of interest group theory in the period since World War II. Prior to the mid-1960s, he points out, "the work of Dahl, Truman, Lind- blom, and others provided a coherent and convincing theory of power in America. Dahl's polyarchy and the implicit 'eco- nomic theory of democracy' provided a theory of elections. Truman's description of American institutions and politics as a' complex texture of decentralized bargain- ing among a myriad of interest groups was readily assimilated into Dahl's plural- ist discussion of power. Lindblom's theory of incremental decision making showed why policies emerging from de- centralized bargaining within a polyarchy might be both more effective and repre- sentative than policies emerging from cen- tral government direction" (p. 129). The disillusionment and demoralization in U.S. politics in the 1960s and 1970s shook the credibility of this model; and in its place a "plural-elitist" model, devel- oped in the work of Lowi (1969) and others, came to be an influential view in the discipline. In this model special inter- ests captured particular areas of public policy, forming "iron triangles" or "sub- governments," not subject to popular control. This pluralist revisionism of the 1970s and 1980s reacted only to the inter- est group theory of the 1950s and 1960s, and as I shall suggest it failed to register the fact that its pessimism was similar to the pluralist pessimism of the 1930s, which was based on a many-times repli- cated appreciation of the fact that the power of business interests was substan- tially more equal than other interests. A third model associated with the work of James Q. Wilson (1980), McFarland calls the "triadic model." In this model the policy process is viewed as specialized by issue areas. Normally interest groups mobilizing to lobby the government in a particular direction are opposed by coun- tervailing groups, and "state agencies are normally assumed to have a significant degree of autonomy . . . as well as a capacity to give some coherence and con- tinuity to the system" (p. 141). The triad 854</page><page sequence="3">Return to the State consists of the two interest group camps and an autonomous set of state agencies, varying across issue areas. The important point made by Garson and McFarland from the perspective of the present statism-pluralism polemic is that with the exception of the classic pluralism interlude of the turn-of-the- century period and a few formulations in the 1950s and 1960s (Latham 1952; Golembiewski 1960), the various versions of interest group theory have operated with some measure and form of govern- mental autonomy. The intellectual history that I shall review is readily accessible. In an article, "The State," published in the original Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences, the political theorist, George Sabine com- plained a bit about the concept. "The word commonly denotes no class of objects that can be identified exactly, and for the same reason it signifies no list of attributes which bears the sanction of common usage. The word must be de- fined more or less arbitrarily to meet the exigencies of the system of jurisprudence or political philosophy in which it occurs" (1934, 328). Thirty-four years later in the successor compendium of social science knowledge, The International Encyclo- pedia of the Social Sciences, Frederick Watkins observed that the complexity of the interaction of government and people is such that "political scientists prefer to use other terms in describing the phenom- ena that once was subsumed under the concept 'state"' (1968, 156). Watkins acknowledges that the con- cepts of the state and sovereignty made sense in the century-and-a-half between the Treaty of Westphalia and the French Revolution, during the Age of Absolut- ism, when Louis XIV could say "I'Etat c'est Moi," and Frederick II could speak of himself as "der erste Diener des Staates." Democratization led to a devaluation of the normative concept of the state. In a democratic society it is hard to distinguish the state from the citizens in whose name its authority is being exercised: "Sover- eignty thus conceived is little more than a bloodless legal fiction. Attention shifts from the state to the government, which though it makes no claim to sovereignty, does all the actual ruling" (p. 153). If there is any point in the use of the concept, according to Watkins, it is in the Weberian sense "that the distinctive fea- ture of the state, as compared with other associations, is its attempt to monopolize coercive power within its own territory. ... From the standpoint of a purely de- scriptive political science it is sufficient, therefore, to define the state in terms of the limit, and to study the conditions that accompany the greater or lesser degrees of monopoly that have been achieved in par- ticular times and places. The difficulty is that it places excessive emphasis on the coercive aspects of political life" (pp. 153-54). As the state concept fell into disuse in mainstream political science it was re- placed by such terms as government, and later by political system. The tendency to abandon the state concept and replace it by other concepts was attributable to the enormous political mobilization that took place in the Western world in the nine- teenth and twentieth centuries and the proliferation of new political institutions -political parties, pressure groups, the mass media, and the like-that accom- panied it. The concept of the political sys- tem included the phenomena of the state -the legally empowered and legitimately coercive institutions-but it also included these new extralegal and paralegal institu- tions of political parties, interest groups, media of communication, as well as social institutions such as family, school, church, and the like, insofar as they affected political processes. Political sys- tem theory and structural-functionalism were not reductionist of the state and gov- ernmental institutions. They grew out of a realism that recognized the processual 855</page><page sequence="4">American Political Science Review Vol. 82 character of politics, and examined insti- tutions-legal, paralegal, and informal- in terms of what they actually did. Struc- tural-functionalism was just that; and sys- tem theory was a formal acknowledge- ment that the political process was a set of interdependent subprocesses. For the Marxists and neo-Marxists, however, the state continued to be a cen- tral concept, the instrumentality through which the capitalist class dominated the social order. For the Marxists the assimi- lation of the state into the political system and its disaggregation into a host of inter- acting phenomena in mainstream political science represented a fudging of the real- ity of class struggle. As I shall suggest, for the Marxist intellectual tradition the rela- tion of the state to class struggle continues to the present day to be a central polemical issue. And Skocpol's notion of the autonomy of the state has to be seen in the context of that Marxist, neo-Marxist, and post-Marxist polemic. The first major assault on this abandon- ment of the state concept in mainstream political science was that of J. P. Nettl, whose article, "The State As a Conceptual Variable" (1968) appeared in the same year as the publication of Watkins's ency- clopedia article. Nettl explained the neglect of the concept of the state in Britain and the United States, and particu- larly in the United States, by the fact that the phenomena of "stateness" are weak in those countries. But the general point made by Nettl regarding the differing salience of the state in the United States and in continental Europe has been appre- ciated at least since Tocqueville and has been part of the conventional wisdom of comparative government and politics. Though he advocates a return to the state concept, he does not effectively deal with Sabine's and Watkins's uneasiness about the ambiguity of the term. He offers a definition of the state with four components. First, "it is a collectivity that summates a set of functions and structures in order to generalize their applicability" (1968, 562). It is not clear which structures and which functions Nettl includes in this collectivity, although he refers to bureaucracies, par- liaments, and even political parties. Second, the state is a unit in international relations; all independent nations, whether having strong or weak states, have this unified international aspect. Third, the state is autonomous; it is a dis- tinct sector of society. And fourth, the state is a sociocultural phenomena, by which Nettl means that the individual members of the state have a generalized cognition and perception of it. "Stateness," according to Nettl, is a quantitative variable, and the strength and weakness of the state in individual societies can be compared through func- tional analysis. Nettl includes among these functions, that of central admin- istration, which varies in strength and scope across countries. Thus Anglo- American central administration is weaker than the continental European pattern. Law enforcement patterns differ in strong and weak states; thus in Britain and the United States law and law en- forcement have more autonomy than is the case in continental Europe. The legal professions are more clearly independent of government. He also suggests the hypothesis that the strength and the weakness of central administration are related to the strength and weakness of party systems. Nettl's contribution is an argument to go beyond the mainstream Anglo-Ameri- can view of the state as the "general area of central government in contradistinc- tion to society" (p. 591) and to examine the proposition that "more or less state- ness is a useful variable for comparing western societies, and that the absence or presence of a well-developed concept of state relates to and identifies important empirical differences in these societies" (p. 592). 856</page><page sequence="5">Return to the State When all is said and done, Nettl has dis- aggregated the state into a variety of com- ponents, which he treats as quantifiable and measurable variables. The all-impor- tant question for his thesis, how the state concept relates, aggregates, summates, integrates-and so on-such phenomena as bureaucracies, courts, armies, parlia- ments, parties, interest groups, media of communication, and public opinion is not answered by Nettl. What political phe- nomena does it include? What does it exclude? How should one weight these components? Like Sabine and Watkins, Nettl is telling us that to measure stateness it is necessary to operationalize and dis- aggregate the concept. What the state is depends on which operational measures one decides to use. Nettl's argument that nations vary in their degree of stateness, by which he means the scope and extent of governmental power and authority, was similar to the arguments then being made by political scientists using other terms such as public policy, governmen- tal output, and governmental perform- ance. Lowi's threefold classification of policy areas-regulative, distributive, and redistributive-had already been on the table for four years at the time of Nettl's writing and was soon to be used by the former in cross-national comparison. The comparative historical, and econo- metric public policy movements were get- ting under way in the middle and late 1960s; and they would successfully bring to earth those cross-national contrasts that Nettl was emphasizing in his notion of "stateness." Another predecessor claimed by the contemporary statist movement is Alfred Stepan whose State and Society: Peru in Comparative Perspective appeared in 1978. Stepan is also critical of the "reduc- tionism" of the liberal pluralist and classic Marxist approaches to the state and poli- tics. But he does not go quite as far as the more recent statists. While his area specialty is Latin America, his reduction- ist critique is addressed to comparative politics generally. The particular point he makes with respect to Latin American studies is that there is an alternative body of theory-the organic-statist-corporatist theoretical tradition-that is more appro- priate for the analysis of Latin American and Ibero-European politics, since this theoretical tradition developed in re- sponse to the institutional traditions and characteristics of these areas. He describes the liberal-pluralist approach to the state as integrally individualist and as fully committed to the doctrine that there can be no "general good" other than that which flows from the pursuit of the inter- ests of individuals: "A methodological and normative assumption among both political and economic thinkers in the lib- eral pluralist tradition is that it is un- desirable to use the concept of the general good" (p. 7). Stepan also argues that liberal-pluralism treats the state as a dependent variable, that such theories tend systematically to draw attention away from viewing the state as an auton- omous agency. This distortion of liberal pluralism in Stepan's work is shared with the contemporary statist movement, and I will return to this question of the place of the general welfare, the state, and the government in pluralist theory and re- search. It should, however, be pointed out that Stepan's book reflects a more substantial search of the literature than the later work in the new statist tradition. It is not clear where to locate Eric Nord- linger in this polemic (1981). He stops short of unfurling a new paradigmatic banner (1987). He is empirical and "posi- tivist" to the core. In asserting the auton- omy of the state he by no means excludes the power of societal factors. Rather he attributes a societal reductionism to his mainstream colleagues and represents his own work as an important effort to carve out a place for the initiative of govern- mental officials in the making of public policy. If one corrects for his misreading 857</page><page sequence="6">American Political Science Review Vol. 82 of the pluralist tradition, there is no change of paradigm here but rather a research program of considerable promise intended to distinguish among polities according to the degree to which state (governmental) personnel take the initia- tive in the making of public policy and the factors and conditions that explain these differences in degree. I do not believe that a research program of this kind would strike the typical political science prac- titioner as a revolutionary departure from mainstream research designs, which, as I shall show, typically accord quite sub- stantial policy initiative and autonomy to political executives, high-level bureau- crats, legislative committees and leaders, and the like. Nordlinger avoids vague and amor- phous formulations. Unlike the statists he offers a definition of the state in opera- tional terms: "The definition of the state must refer to individuals rather than to some other kinds of phenomena, such as 'institutional arrangements' or the legal normative order. Since we are primarily concerned with the making of public policy, a conception of the state that does not have individuals at its core could lead directly into the anthropomorphic and reification fallacies.... Only individuals have preferences and engage in actions that make for their realization. And only by making individuals central to the defi- nition can Hegelian implications (substan- tive and metaphysical) be avoided when referring to the state's preferences" (1981, 9). Nordlinger has three other components of a definition of the state. The state should be defined to include not only the government and the bureaucratic agencies that derive their authority from it, "it should include all public officials-elec- tive and appointive-at high and low levels-who are involved in the making of public policy" (1981, 10). It should avoid all characterizations that may vary from case to case, such as legitimacy and sover- eignty. Finally, a definition should seek neutrality; it should avoid attributing specific functions and purposes to all states, such as the preservation of stability or the reproduction of capitalism. With this carefully empirical set of defining characteristics, Nordlinger at- tacks what he alleges to be the "near unanimity . . . of all variants of liberal and Marxist writing on democratic poli- tics" on the question of the dominance of societal constraints on the making of pub- lic policy. He refutes these imputed theo- retical positions by asserting that there are three levels of state autonomy in policy- making and then illustrates them through an analysis of the secondary literature. The lowest level of state autonomy (type 3) refers to situations in which state and society preferences do not diverge and the state acts on its own preferences; that is to say, the particular policy adopted is the one preferred by state officials even though it does not encounter opposition from society. The second level of auton- omy is one in which society's preferences differ from the state's preferences, but state officials persuade society to adopt state preferences. The third and highest level (type 1) is represented in situations in which the preferences of state and soci- ety diverge; but the state nevertheless enacts a policy consistent with its prefer- ences. This extreme case, crucial to the support of Nordlinger's theory of state autonomy, is illustrated by analysis of the various ways in which the state can play on social divisions and employ the for- midable powers of government. In a later paper (1987) Nordlinger offers a fourfold classification of state-society relations in terms of high and low state autonomy and societal support that has interesting re- search possibilities. Though Nordlinger fails to-and indeed cannot-document his characterization of liberal scholarship as societally reductionist, there is no doubt that he has made an important con- tribution to empirical theory. His analysis 858</page><page sequence="7">Return to the State is rigorous and heuristic, full of interest- ing research leads. Pluralism As Theory and in Empirical Research The view associated with the Commit- tee on States and Social Structures of the Social Science Research Council (SSRC) is a more integral critique of the so-called waning orthodoxies or paradigms of con- temporary political science. These ortho- doxies are "pluralism-structural function- alism" and Marxism. They are said to treat the state as a dependent variable; its actions are explained by the interplay of interest groups or of social classes. Thus Theda Skocpol, in her introduction to the first book published under the auspices of this committee, states that the previously dominant pluralist-functionalist ap- proaches viewed government "primarily as an arena within which economic inter- est groups or normative social movements contended or allied with one another to shape the making of public policy deci- sions. Those decisions were understood to be allocations of benefits among demand- ing groups. Research centered on the soci- etal "inputs" to government and on the distributive effects of governmental out- puts. Government itself was not taken very seriously as an independent actor, and in comparative research variations in governmental organization were deemed less significant than the general functions shared by the political systems of all societies" (Evans, Rueschemeyer, and Skocpol 1985, 4; cf. Skocpol 1982). This attribution of society-centeredness to the earlier literature is repeated at other points in this first book of the SSRC Com- mittee (Evans, Rueschemeyer, and Skoc- pol 1985, chaps. 4, 10). Stephen Krasner, another committee member, comments along these same lines in a review article: "Pure interest group versions of pluralism virtually ignore public actors and institu- tions. The government is seen as a cash register that totals up and then averages the preferences and political power of societal actors. Government may thus be seen as an arena within which societal actors struggle to insure the success of their own particular preferences. The major function of public officials is to make sure that the game is played fairly. If public institutions are viewed as figura- tive cash registers or as literal referees, there is no room for anything that could be designated as a state as actor with autonomous preferences capable of manipulating and even restructuring its own society" (1984, 226). According to Krasner, where pluralists do recognize the initiating role of political leaders, they reduce state institutions to "individuals acting in roles" not restrained by institu- tional "imperatives and restraints." This is a more complex version of the reduction- ist argument; for Krasner it is an indi- vidualist as well as a societal reduc- tionism. In making the case for this reductionist treatment of the state and government in pluralism and structural functionalism neither Skocpol nor Krasner provides us with a literature search commensurate with the scope and variety of the political science literature about which they are generalizing. They seem to claim that the literature of political science may be sub- sumed under these two categories of pluralism-structural functionalism and Marxism. Would they include the sub- stantial literature on Communist coun- tries? Surely this literature, even that part of it that experimented with pluralist models, took governmental actors seri- ously, and dealt with the coercive, extrac- tive, and regulative powers of govern- ment in addition to the allocative. Would an examination of the comparative gov- ernment and politics literature and the country studies of Britain, France, Ger- many, Italy, and so on, with their empha- sis on the power of political executives 859</page><page sequence="8">American Political Science Review Vol. 82 and bureaucracies, sustain Skocpol's com- plaint regarding the neglect of state agen- cies in mainstream political science? In U.S. studies how would they deal with the substantial literature on the presidency, the Congress, and the courts? How would they dispose of the flurry of publications on military regimes in third-world coun- tries that appeared in the 1960s and 1970s? If we look at the larger specifically pluralist literature, can we sustain this statist critique? Suppose we examine the ideas of the original statists in order to put both pluralism and statism into historical perspective. And then let us look at the empirical research done by the pluralists. Does it indeed conform to the society- centered reductionist pattern presented by Skocpol, Krasner, and their collabora- tors? Does it conform to the on-the-whole similar portraits presented by Nettl, Stepan, and Nordlinger? It is sobering that although their central theme is the affirmation of statism as an alternative to pluralism, neither Skocpol nor Krasner nor the other antipluralists cited here seem to have looked into the original confrontation of statism and pluralism at the end of the nineteenth cen- tury and in the early decades of the twen- tieth. And although their argument for a return to the state rests on the claim that the pluralist empirical literature reduced the state and government to an arena and treated the government as a dependent variable (to the extent that it treated it at all) they simply fail to cite or to discuss the very substantial pluralist "interest group" literature of the last three quarters of a century. It would not have taken a major search to raise serious questions about the valid- ity of these statist characterizations. There are excellent reviews of the early statist and pluralist literature in the two encyclopedias of the social sciences-arti- cles on the state by George Sabine (1934) and Frederick Watkins (1968) and articles on pluralism by Francis Coker (1934) and Henry Kariel (1968), all political theorists of repute. Sabine traces the emergence of the state concept from Machiavelli's il stato in The Prince and the first adoption of the term secretary of state for minister- ial offices in the reign of Elizabeth. Its usage spread with the rise and diffusion of absolutism. And the notion of sovereign- ty developed along with it. The emer- gence of the state in the course of the six- teenth to nineteenth centuries was associ- ated with expansion, aggression, and war making. As a process, the western Euro- pean state arose out of a logic of aggres- sion or defense against aggression. It was a consequence of the growth of armies and the recruitment and training of civil bureaucracies concerned with the extrac- tion of resources, the procurement of sup- plies, and the regulation of behavior-all primarily in relation to this military- defense-expansion set of goals. The poten- tial progressiveness of the state resulted from this concentration of power and its separation from the person of the ruler or rulers. As compared with the complicated dynastic, sacred, and secular particular- isms that preceded it, it had the potential- ity for providing greater personal secur- ity, a larger internal market, and perhaps improved systems of law and justice. The notion of state sovereignty sur- vived the crises of the democratic revolu- tions. What happened was that the "peo- ple" became sovereign or "parliament" became sovereign. But the state was con- ceived as unitary, as above society, and as legitimately penetrative of the entire terri- tory and population under its jurisdiction. It was this conception of the central- ized, superimposed absolute state, em- bodied in the sovereign and the agencies of the "crown," that was the target of the pluralists of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Opposition to this all-powerful notion of state sovereignty came both from the Right and the Left. From the conservative side J. Neville 860</page><page sequence="9">Return to the State Figgis (1914) affirmed the autonomous rights of churches and neighborhood communities. From the Center and the Left Ernest Barker (1930), A. D. Lindsay (1929), and Harold Laski (1919) affirmed the autonomy of economic and profes- sional groups and trade unions. The English theorists drew on German and French authorities-Otto Gierke (1900), Emile Durkheim (1950), and Leon Duguit (1919)-for authority for their anti- monism. What is crucial for the argument of the contemporary statists is Francis Coker's (1934) unequivocal statement that Neither the pluralists nor their theoretical fore- runners, however, really make the groups in- dependent of the state. Gierke maintained that the state is sovereign-supreme in legal and moral right-where general interests require the exertion of organized social power for their maintenance. Paul Boncour regarded the state as the sole organ of national solidarity, with a duty to prevent any group from acting oppressively toward the public, other groups or its own mem- bers. Durkheim ascribed to the state the function of defining general policies, leaving to the several associations only the task of diversifying, under state supervision, the application of the policies according to the special requirements of the several associations. Figgis described the state as the communitas communitatem and assigned to it distinctive tasks and a superior authority as the chief agency of social adjustment and coordina- tion. . . Barker warns against carrying the recent pluralist trends too far; the state as the most embracing scheme of social life must be allowed to adjust the relations of associations to one another and to their members in order to preserve the equality of associations, and protect the individual from the possible tyranny of his own group. (p. 172) Laski-the most extreme of the anti- monists-goes far towards recommending a powerful state that would own monopo- listic industries; regulate the rest of the economy; set basic standards for hours, wages, and working conditions; and fix prices for necessities. Coker concludes, It appears then that when the pluralists set forth their abstract theory they deny the sovereign power of the state or else characterize the power of something which is properly only ultimate and reserved; but when they devise the specific insti- tutional arrangements to carry out their theory they assign to the state numerous tasks, in laying down general policies and seeing that they are observed, which obviously require, not an ulti- mate and reserved, but a very direct and con- stantly exercised power. ... They would retain the state but deprive it of sovereignty. It appears, however, that they accomplish this compromise only in words. They allow the state to secure its funds through compulsory taxation, retain the whole traditional system of a compulsory allegi- ance applied to all members of the community and assign to this comprehensive and coercive association extensive duties in directing the eco- nomic and social life of the community. (1934, 173) In the International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences (1968) Henry Kariel gives a version of pluralist theory somewhat more supportive of the reductionist gov- ernment-as-arena model. But here he is referring to the earlier formulations of the theorists of pluralism. He reports that by the 1930s "it appeared necessary to some of the pluralists to reintroduce what they had previously banished; a unified pur- pose above and beyond the will of a plur- ality of groups. . They had rejected such ideas as common good, community interests, and general will. Yet they found it scarcely possible to conceive of the political process without the purposeful, helpful hand of the state, especially as domestic group competition, and foreign threats endangered the viability of a plur- alistic political order. Thus both Laski and Cole were finally driven to recognize needs more fundamental than a vibrant group life. They were to argue for both leadership to give expression to these needs and a state equipped to satisfy them" (p. 507). Kariel insists, however, that a latent integral pluralism persists in some unspecified part of mainstream political science. The pluralist writings that are viewed as coming closest to the portraits pre- sented by the statists are those of Arthur Bentley (1908, 1967), David Truman (1951), and Earl Latham (1952). Bentley's Process of Government received almost 861</page><page sequence="10">American Political Science Review Vol. 82 no attention for the several decades be- tween its publication in 1908 and the appearance of Truman's book in 1951. In his introduction to the 1967 edition of Bentley's book, Peter Odegard remarks on the fact that Bentley provides little em- pirical data on interest group activity, despite the fact that pressure groups and the lobby were high salience issues at the turn of the century. His book was essen- tially theoretical; it came close to present- ing a formal model, an analytic reduction of institutions to observable behavior with interest groups the all-powerful ex- planatory variable. Peter Odegard argues that had the book been more balanced as between modeling and empirical data and had the model been presented as a model rather than as an abstraction of reality, Bentley might not have been so long neglected by scholars. Thus the large U.S. pressure group literature that appeared in the 1920s to 1940s was not influenced by his work; and the pressure group litera- ture of the 1950s and 1960s sometimes cited Bentley, but it did not adopt his group reductionist and behaviorist model. The empirical pressure group research of the first decades of the twentieth century originated in the muckraking tradition of the turn-of-the-century period. David Truman, the leading group theo- rist of recent political science, utilized Bentley as an analytical model but devoted almost half of his trail-breaking book to the interactions of interest groups and governmental processes. Though governmental institutions are treated from a group perspective, there is clear recognition of their autonomous decision- making capacity. Thus in his chapter on the executive he points out that The importance of the executive branch, how- ever, does not derive simply from its size or from the variety of its activities. It is of far greater sig- nificance that the operation of these activities necessitates choices among alternate lines of action, the exercise of discretion.... Both the newer and the expanded older functions of gov- ernment create the necessity for a large measure of administrative discretion, and the tendency is toward the widening of such powers rather than toward their restriction.... The obligation to remain minimally accessible to all legitimate interests in the society can supply him with a measure of independence and a persuasive power that effectively supplements his formal authority. .. . Access to the governor or president is not sought by interest groups simply out of habit; the means of leadership in the hands of these officials are not negligible. The president's roles as chief executive, chief legislator, chief of state, and commander of the armed forces are real, not nominal. (1951, 396, 427). It is not possible save through distortion to describe these several chapters depict- ing the interaction of groups and govern- ment, as simply reflecting the arena or the cash register model. Executives, congress- men, and judges have both authority and discretion. In his article, "Political Group Analy- sis" in the International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences (1968), Truman refers to this "referee" model of governmental processes as an oversimplification leading "to the error of treating a limiting case as if it were the norm. This obvious error occurs with great frequency in the litera- ture, despite the fact that even our rough knowledge of the distribution of cases of the relation between interest group and government demonstrates that this over- simplification fails to square with the evi- dence concerning a vast range of in- stances" (pp. 243-44). Earl Latham (1952) does present an in- tegral group theory of U.S. government. He does this by characterizing govern- mental institutions as groups themselves; and argues the case for a group politics equilibrium model of the policy-making process. But he runs into problems with governmental agencies as groups. He finds that there is a unilateral, asym- metrical quality about government as groups. The policeman can stop traffic; drivers cannot stop the policeman. He gropes in an effort to accommodate the peculiar properties of officials. He rejects Krasner's metaphor of the pluralist state 862</page><page sequence="11">Return to the State as a cash register more than 30 years before Krasner uses it: "In these adjust- ments of group interest, the legislature does not play the part of inert cash register, ringing up the additions and withdrawals of strength; it is not a mind- less balance pointing to and marking the weight and distribution of power among the contending groups" (p. 391). Thus both houses of Congress are groups with senses of identity and with their own interests. Executives, legislators, and judges are "officials"; if they are members of groups, their groups are not of the same order as nonofficial groups. He writes, "The groups so privileged collec- tively make up the instrumentalities of the state, and such groups are distinguished from others only in their possession of the characteristics of officiality" (p. 389). The reductionist model, while applica- ble to the work of Bentley and Latham, can only with difficulty be applied to that of Truman. And it completely fails to cap- ture the empirical interest group research of the 1920s to 1960s, the very literature described as society-centered by the neo- statists. In demonstrating that this litera- ture operated with a very lively sense of the autonomy and discretion of govern- ment, both empirically and normatively, I shall cite a selection of Americanists-in particular Pendleton Herring; Elmer Schattschneider, V. 0. Key, Jr.; Robert Dahl; and Bauer, Pool, and Dexter-and Harry Eckstein, Henry Ehrmann, and Joseph La Palombara among the Euro- peanists. On the question of societal reductionism more broadly in the political science literature of the 1960s and 1970s, I shall review briefly some of the U.S. and comparative government text literature of this period. One of the most influential political sci- ence studies of the 1930s was Pendleton Herring's Public Administration and the Public Interest (1936). His principal ques- tion was how administrative organization in a democracy could resist the onslaught of particularistic groups and its own con- servative propensities and contribute to the general welfare. In the light of the con- flicts of the New Deal period he points out that the democratic state must somehow deal with the conflict between capital and labor. "It cannot afford to await the sur- vival of the fittest. The exigencies of the age demand positive state activity in order that democracy itself may continue" (p. 379). He continues, "Unless we are to rest resigned with this situation upon the supposition that this is the inherent nature of the democratic state, there is need for promoting a purpose of the state over and above the purposes of the medley of inter- ests that compose it" (p. 380). On the autonomy of the state and the need for increasing this autonomy Her- ring writes, "The need of attempting to formulate an official program in the pub- lic interest by a responsible administrative agency arises from the experienced strength of minority groups in pressing their case by propaganda and organized agitation. . . . The offering of positive proposals by a responsible administration is then the first goal to seek.... The in- creased power of the president means, of course, an increase in the importance of the bureaucracy. . . . If the existence of the democratic regime rests upon the assumption that the state exists not for the welfare of any one class but for the benefit of the people as a whole, this great and growing bureaucracy must be guarded from domination by economic groups or social classes" (pp. 383-84). This whole concluding chapter of Pendleton Herring's work of the mid-1930s might well serve as a bible for the contemporary state auton- omy movement, even to the point of the use of the same vocabulary. Elmer Schattschneider, a leading authority on U.S. politics and pressure groups of the 1930s and 1940s, describes the U.S. presidency as the principal rally- ing point for the great public interest of the nation, the point at which the issues of 863</page><page sequence="12">American Political Science Review Vol. 82 public policy are discovered and exploited (1942). V. Q. Key, Jr.-the leading U.S. theo- rist of parties, elections, public opinion, and pressure groups-whose views are crucial for the statist critique of pluralism, has a long concluding chapter, "Pressure Groups and the General Welfare" in his text on political parties, first published in 1948 and appearing until well into the 1960s. He argues that public officials and political leaders "can frequently obtain acceptance of a policy more nearly reflect- ing the general interest by going over the heads of pressure group leaders to work- ers, businessmen, to farmers who have ordinarily a greater sense of community responsibility than do their hired men in the offices of pressure societies" (1952, 174). To illustrate the capacity of govern- ment to resist special interests, Key cites major statutes regulating the interests of powerful groups in the 1930s-among them the Public Utility Holding Company Act, and the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act-where powerful organized interests were present and actively lobbying against the legislation and where there were no organized groups representing the ordinary citizens whose interests were protected by these acts. These last two examples would come close to represent- ing Nordlinger's type 1 cases of state autonomy. The two classic political process studies of the 1960s-Dahl's Who Governs? (1961) and the Bauer, Pool, and Dexter American Business and Public Policy (1963)-both reported results reflecting the autonomy of governmental officials and governmental agencies. In their con- clusions on the relative importance of "societal" and governmental agencies in the enactment of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1954-55, Bauer, Pool, and Dexter point out that "a Republican administration"-normally most suscepti- ble to the pressure of business interests for protection from foreign competition- "... felt free to adopt as the most cher- ished item of its legislative program a Roosevelt measure which transferred tariff making from the legislative to the executive branch" (1963, 466), where, it should be pointed out, tariff making would be less exposed to group pressures. Indeed, their study of business interests and tariff policy in the post-World War II period records the attenuation of "socie- tal" influences and the attainment of "state autonomy" with respect to this field of foreign economic policy. Dahl's study of redevelopment policy-making in New Haven in the 1960s has the well-deserved reputation of having moved the study of policy-making forward by demonstrating the strong relationship between political structure and process and the substance of public policy. Rather than being societally reductionist, Dahl's study was directed against the community power model of C. Wright Mills, Floyd Hunter, and others, which was reductionist, attributing gen- eralized and dominant political influence to the upper business and professional interests. Dahl demonstrated that New Haven had a number of different policy processes that were triggered by different kinds of issues. In the case of redevelop- ment in New Haven, he shows that Mayor Lee initiated this policy long before there was any interest group or popular movement favoring urban re- newal. Krasner (1984) acknowledges that this was the case, but insists that Dahl has reduced "state institutions" to "in- dividuals and roles," failing to take into account the constraints of institutions. I will deal with this version of the reduc- tionist thesis in the context of how statists define state autonomy. In an authoritative work on govern- mental regulation in the United States, James Q. Wilson (1980) writes in his introduction, "Today the federal govern- ment is active with respect to virtually the full range of human affairs, much of its power is exercised, and many of its pur- 864</page><page sequence="13">Return to the State poses are defined, by a large bureaucratic apparatus" (p. vii). In his concluding dis- cussion of the origins of regulation he shows how neither a societal nor a statal "paradigm" would capture reality: "The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) was cre- ated to help business, but the Occupa- tional Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) was formed over the objections of business. The laws administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were enacted over the opposition of those segments of the economy to be regulated. * . .The Shipping Act that was to be administered by what later became known as the Federal Maritime Commis- sion (FMC) was passed over the opposi- tion of the shipowners whom it was to regulate, but with the support of shippers it was supposed to help. Though the Sher- man Antitrust Act did not have to over- come well-organized business opposition, neither was the chief impetus for its pas- sage the demand of business" (p. 364). During the 1920s and 1930s, at a time when U.S. pressure group studies were already thriving, European scholars viewed pressure groups in reductionist and normative terms. The political scien- tists of the Left tended to reduce pressure groups to class phenomena. Conservative European political scientists viewed pres- sure groups as political pathologies. Only the state and the bureaucracy had legiti- mate power and were capable of acting in the general interest. After World War II a number of empir- ical studies of interest groups in Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and other coun- tries began to appear. For the purposes of our argument here it may be sufficient to review three exemplars of this literature: Harry Eckstein's study of the British Medical Association (1960), Henry Ehr- mann's study of organized business in France (1957), and Joseph La Palombara's (1964) study of Italian interest groups. In the introduction to his study of the British Medical Association Eckstein points out, Pressure is concentrated upon the executive in Britain, first because of the logic of cabinet gov- ernment in a political system having two highly disciplined parties; such a system precludes any consistently successful exertion of influence through members of Parliament, or, less obvi- ously perhaps, through the political parties. Secondly, pressure is focussed on the executive because the broad scope and technical character of contemporary social and economic policies has led to a considerable shift of functions to the bureaucracy.... "The predominance of skeletal legislation is not due solely to circumstance (e.g. technical legislation) but also reflects the power of the executive which likes to have a relatively free hand." (1960, 18, 20) He points out that pressure groups are anxious not to get on the wrong side of the government because of the crucial powers that they enjoy over their affairs. Commenting on Bentley's one-sided inter- pretation of group influence, Eckstein observes, "The state in Britain today dis- poses directly of 40 percent of the national income, and that fact speaks for itself. We may regard political systems as amalgams of potential and actual pressure groups, groups which from a political standpoint are merely 'categoric' groups, and groups which have actually been drawn into politics, chiefly through the impact of public policies, either policies actually adopted or policies which are threatened. In short, we can usefully stand Bentley on his head to supplement Bentley right side up; if interaction among politically active groups produces policy, policy in turn creates politically active groups" (p. 27). According to Eckstein the influence and effectiveness of pressure groups is sub- stantially dependent on governmental policy and organization. His approach is neither societally reductionist nor statist reductionist. Like almost all of his plural- ist colleagues he sees the policy process as a set of interactions between state and society. Ehrmann's (1957) study of business groups in France emphasizes the tradition 865</page><page sequence="14">American Political Science Review Vol. 82 of central administrative power. He notes the importance of the nationalized indus- tries under the Fourth Republic, the con- trol of money and credit, exports, and convertability, governmental price fixing, and the like. He describes the transforma- tions of the Fifth Republic as shifting power from the parties and parliament to the executive and bureaucracy. In lan- guage that would gratify the most "stat- ist" of the neostatists Ehrmann catalogs the major triumphs of President de Gaulle in battles with organized interests: In regard to major decisions, e.g. the Algerian or the European policies, the liquidation of the African Community, or the preparations for an atomic striking force, the interested lobbies (some of them solidly organized and amply financed) were generally ignored by the Elysee and had difficulties in obtaining a hearing in the offices of the Prime Minister.... In two of his most resounding conflicts with the National Assembly the President of the Republic wanted it to be known that he denied to the deputies the exercise of rights granted to them by the wording of the constitution because parliament was in fact obeying the injunction of the agricultural lobby. Such affirmations of the regime's funda- mental hostility towards intermediaries standing between 'le pouvoir' and 'le peuple' were de- signed to dramatize its intentionally authori- tarian style. (1963, 278) To similar effect La Palombara (1964) in his study of Italian interest groups has a whole chapter dealing with the factors that enable the Italian bureaucracy to resist the pressure of interest groups. Among these factors is the culture of the bureaucracy, the sense that the official has of the general or the public interest as he encounters the overtures, blandish- ments, and threats of pressure organiza- tions: "The typical bureaucrat recognizes that he is involved in a highly politicized process and that the concept of public interest is one of the few meaningful weapons he can utilize in order to assert a bureaucratic decision that is not tied to narrow, particularistic interest group con- siderations" (p. 384). The socialization of the bureaucrat in the administrative organization also contributes to the capacity to resist the pressure of special interests. La Palombara concludes from his interviews of Italian officials that "when bureaucrats in large number define their role as requiring the objective appli- cation of the law, they generally do so with pride and with a sense of having to protect the bureaucracy-and therefore the nation-against the irrational and particularistic forces at large in the coun- try" (p. 388). The literature that we have reviewed on pluralist theory, group theory, and the activities of interest groups in the United States and Europe gives the statist polemic the best chance of being sustained. It is after all this literature that has been argu- ing the case for the influence of "societal" organizations in the making of public policy. Though this literature does by and large stress the importance of interest and pressure groups in policy-making, it clear- ly does not support the reductionist thesis. Autonomous government agencies are present and important throughout this literature. The pluralist "paradigm" is not the one-sided one of Skocpol, Krasner, and others but rather a two-directional one with the state influencing the society, as well as the society influencing the state. If the statist polemicists cannot be sus- tained with respect to that literature most likely to support their thesis, how does it fare with respect to the more general political science literature of the pluralist era, for example in the U.S. and compara- tive government text books of the 1950s and 1960s1 A few examples may make the point. The two leading U.S. textbooks of the 1940s to 1960s, written by William Anderson and the perennial (Frederick) Ogg and (P. Orman) Ray, give great stress to the powers of the U.S. presi- dency. Anderson speaks of the U.S. exec- utive as "the government in a very real sense." He has "the power to formulate programs of action" (Anderson and Weid- ner 1953, 578). Ogg and Ray speak of the 866</page><page sequence="15">Return to the State U.S. president as "the most powerful elected executive in the world. He is at once the chief formulator of public policy as embodied in legislation, leader of a major political party boasting thousands of functionaries and millions of adher- ents, chief architect of U.S. foreign policy, . . . director of one of the most gigantic administrative machines ever created, . . . commander in chief of more than two mil- lion men in uniform," and so on (1959, 258). Austin Ranney in a text of the 1960s describes the president as making a great deal of law: "He is generally regarded as our 'chief legislator,' . . . mainly because he has taken over most of the initiative in the nation's statute-making process" (1966, 442). In the 1963 edition of another leading text on U.S. government, Burns and Peltason's Government by the Peo- ple, the authors also speak of the presi- dent as the chief legislator (pp. 424-25). Indeed, without exception, the texts of the pluralist era in U.S. political science refer to the president as the chief legislator and policymaker of the nation. The texts in comparative government during these decades gave similar stress to the importance of the political executive. Carter and Herz (1972) speak of the polit- ical executive in democracies as laying down "the essential lines of policy in every field of domestic and foreign af- fairs; he must coordinate the innumerable agencies of what, in most modern coun- tries, has become the biggest business establishment"-"the executive branch of government.... he must deal with a vast variety of interest groups and be able to resist their often powerful pressures" (p. 152). And in the Samuel Beer and Adam Ulam text edition of 1964, the chapter on Britain describes the British Cabinet as the very center of power and the higher civil service as the initiator and drafter of almost all legislation (p. 103). The conventional wisdom of the polit- ical science literature of this period em- phasized the importance not only of the political executive but of the bureaucracy. Thus Robert Putnam exclaimed, "Public bureaucracies, staffed largely by perma- nent civil servants, are responsible for the vast majority of policy initiatives taken by governments. Discretion not merely for deciding individual cases, but for crafting the content of most legislation has passed from the legislature to the executive. Bureaucrats, monopolizing as they do much of the available information of shortcomings of existing policies, as well as much of technical expertise neces- sary to design practical alternatives, have gained a predominant influence over the evolution of the agenda for decisions" (1973, 17). It might be expected that the political sociologists would be more likely to mani- fest the society-centeredness that the stat- ists have attributed to the pluralists and the structural functionalists. Since soci- ologists specialize in social structure and processes, it might be expected that they would incline toward explaining the state and politics in terms of society. In a series of papers on the scope and content of political sociology going back to the 1950s, S. M. Lipset and William Schneider trace the history of this debate from the state-centeredness of the Hegel- ians to the society-centeredness of Proud- hon and Marx. In Max Weber and the later political sociologists the causal arrows go both ways, and both concepts -state and society-are disaggregated into their component parts. Lipset and Schneider argue, "Political sociology can be defined as the study of the interrela- tionship between society and polity, be- tween social structures and political insti- tutions. It is important to note that this definition does not assign causal priority to society over polity; political sociology is not solely the study of the social factors that condition the political order. Indeed political institutions are themselves social structures, and hence are often the in- 867</page><page sequence="16">American Political Science Review Vol. 82 dependent (that is) causal factors that affect nonpolitical social structure" (1973, 400-401). A Note on Marxism and Structural Functionalism The evidence on the pluralist literature, both theoretical and empirical, clearly cannot support the neostatist critique of society-centeredness. But the neostatists also included structural functionalism and Marxism in their polemic against society- centeredness. With respect to Marxism, they are without question correct. Skoc-' pol argues that "at the theoretical level, virtually all neo-Marxist writers on the state have retained deeply imbedded society-centered assumptions, not allow- ing themselves to doubt that, at base, states are inherently shaped by classes or class struggles and function to preserve and expand modes of production" (Evans, Rueschemeyer, and Skocpol 1985, 5). Martin Carnoy's review (1984) of neo- Marxist theories of the state-from Gramsci to Althusser to Poulantzas and Offe-by and large supports Skocpol's (1982) summary. Indeed, David Easton (1981) character- izes the entire "return-to-the-state" move- ment as arising out of a contemporary revival of Marxism. He speaks of three Marxist "comings." The first coming oc- curred at the time of the origins of the Marxist movement, which touched the United States only superficially in the 1880s and 1890s. The second coming oc- curred in the great depression of the 1930s. This impingement affected U.S. academic life and political science more deeply. The whole, now older, generation of political science was affected by this second wave and by the disillusionments of the late 1930s and 1940s. The third coming of Marxism had taken the form of this neostatist movement-more complex than the first two visitations, but present- ing some of the same difficulties. The polemic against structural func- tionalism is the least-developed theme in the neostatist movement. It is said to be societally reductionist, but no attention is given to the "structural" part of structural functionalism, which after all deals with state agencies and institutions. "Function- alism" developed out of the realist recog- nition that legal or customary norms defining the powers of the various institu- tions usually failed to capture their per- formance. Often they were quite mislead- ing. Hence the properties of institutions were not taken as normatively given but as something to be researched empirically. And particularly if one wanted to com- pare political systems across cultures, one had to examine functions as well as nor- mative and legal structures. Structural functionalism is as old in some ways as political science itself. Separation of powers-a structural-functional theory has been a central theme of political theory at least since Montesquieu. Neostatist Definitions of the State I promised to analyze the statist move- ment on three levels of validity and util- ity. The first of these was the strong statist position that pluralism-structural func- tionalism and Marxism were societally reductionist, that they did not attribute autonomy to the state, and hence were in- adequate approaches to political explana- tion. Our analysis of the evidence sug- gests that this characterization of plural- ism both in theory and in empirical research is incorrect. Overwhelmingly, the pluralist literature has been shown to be one in which governmental autonomy is recognized; in which the explanatory logic goes in both directions, from society to the state and from the state to the soci- ety. Neostatism seems to be a polemic internal to Marxism, since this intellectual movement has in the past decades oper- 868</page><page sequence="17">Return to the State ated from a social class reductionist set of assumptions. If the critique by the neostatists of the mainstream literature of political science has not been supported by evidence, it may still be that the statist approach is significantly superior to pluralism-struc- tural functionalism as an approach to explanation, that it specifies the elements and variables of analysis better, that its causal logic is more powerful, and the like. The writers in this genre may have been careless and mistaken in their search of the literature, but their approach to research design may be superior. The shift from institutionalism to real- ism in the political science of the late nine- teenth and early twentieth centuries was enormously productive. It gave birth to the work of Vilfredo Pareto, Max Weber, Emile Durkheim, Woodrow Wilson, James Bryce, Moissaye Ostrogorski, Roberto Michels, Graham Wallas, George Catlin, Charles Merriam, Harold Lass- well, and Harold Gosnell, among others; to the large empirical literature on polit- ical parties and pressure groups; and to realistic studies of governmental institu- tions and processes. This movement of "realism" assumed that by "unpacking" and disaggregating general and diffuse concepts it was possible to reach a firmer grasp of the reality scholars were seeking to understand, interpret, and explain. We understand liberty, justice, equality, obli- gation better by spelling out their varieties and their component parts. Similarly, as a part of this movement of realism, legal- institutional concepts such as the state were disaggregated. One spoke of govern- ment or of the political system and its various legal-institutional components- executives, bureaucracies, legislatures, and courts-and of agencies and institu- tions of a paralegal and nonlegal sort such as political parties, interest groups, media of communication, and the like. The neostatist movement wants to re- verse this trend and return to large and relatively loosely defined concepts such as the state and society. They write about "strong and weak states" and "strong and weak societies," but it is not clear what they mean by strength and weakness. So many dimensions are con- flated here that they cannot expect this approach to research to be taken serious- ly. Indeed, it is an irony of the statist movement that this central concept either is not clearly specified or, when it is speci- fied, is very like the definitions of gov- ernment, political system, and other terms denoting the totality of political phenomena employed in the mainstream literature. Theda Skocpol approximates a defini- tion of the state in her earlier work on revolutions, where she sets aside the neo- Marxist efforts of Miliband, Poulantzas, Anderson, Therborn, and Offe because they fall short of acknowledging the pos- sibility of state autonomy. She writes, We can make sense of social revolutionary trans- formations only if we take the state seriously as a macro-structure. The state properly conceived is no mere arena in which socio-economic struggles are fought out. It is rather a set of administrative, policing, and military organizations headed, and more or less coordinated by, an executive author- ity. Any state first and fundamentally extracts resources from society and deploys these re- sources to create and support coercive and administrative organizations. Of course, these basic state organizations are built up and must operate within the context of class-divided socio- economic relations as well as within the context of national and international dynamics. More- over, coercive and administrative organizations are only parts of overall political systems. These systems also may contain institutions through which social interests are represented in state policy-making as well as institutions through which nonstate actors are mobilized to partici- pate in policy implementation. Nevertheless, the administrative and coercive organizations are the basis of state power as such." (1979, 29) Skocpol is struggling here to free herself from the class determinism of Marxism. She even adopts the system metaphor to accommodate important aspects of poli- tics not easily reducible to coercive and 869</page><page sequence="18">American Political Science Review Vol. 82 administrative organizations. But in her later work she comes back to a concept the limits and content of which are un- specified. Thus in her more recent for- mulation (Evans, Rueschemeyer, and Skocpol 1985) she skirts the question of defining the state. What she does after cri- tiquing the Marxist and pluralist-struc- tural functionalist approaches to the state, is to cite favorably more "state-centered" types of research, such as the work of Nettl, Stepan, and others. For more remote ancestors of the statist approach she cites Max Weber and Otto Hintze. Because her approach is through illustra- tion rather than specification, it is difficult to distinguish the extent to which and the ways in which her state-centered ap- proach would differ from the treatment of the state and government in the work of Herring, V. 0. Key, Eckstein, Ehrmann, the text writers in U.S. and comparative government. It is also impossible to deter- mine how it differs from the treatment in structural functionalism of executives, bureaucracies, courts, legislatures, par- ties, pressure groups; or how it compares with the enormous literature of the 1960s and 1970s that could not properly be sub- sumed under either of these approaches. In a later chapter in the SSRC volume (Evans, Rueschemeyer, and Skocpol 1985), in collaboration with Margaret Weir, Skocpol presents a number of dia- grams of the policy process. She rejects two that begin the policy process with "socially rooted demands" or "authorita- tive intellectual developments" in favor of the third one that presents the starting point of policy explanation as "state struc- tures and policy legacies," and in which the activities of politicians, and officials, and demands of social groups are treated as intervening variables. She is clearly insisting here on a "state-centered" ex- planation of the policy process. I suggest that the important contrast here is be- tween the state-society interaction model of mainstream political science and this state-centered one. In chapter 2 of this volume Dietrich Rueschemeyer and Peter Evans adopt the Weberian definition of the state as the agency that seeks and maintains a monop- oly of legitimate violence in a given terri- tory. This is not substantially different from mainstream efforts to define govern- ment and the political system (e.g., Almond and Coleman 1960, 6, 7). And if one reads the fine print in the statist litera- ture it is clear that their definitions are quite similar to mainstream definitions. Leaving aside the neo-Marxist vocabu- lary, the conclusions of Rueschemeyer and Evans as to the complexity and diver- sity of state phenomena comparatively considered are really quite eclectic and mainstream: "We recognize that across a range of historical circumstances-in ways that vary substantially-the state tends to be an expression of pacts of dom- ination, to act coherently as a corporate unit, to become an arena of social con- flict, and to present itself as the guardian of universal interests" (Evans, Ruesche- meyer, and Skocpol 1985, 48). Stephen Skowronek's Building a New American State (1984), often represented as the exemplar of the new statist para- digm, does not offer a definition of the state. The narrative of this important con- tribution to U.S. administrative and polit- ical history, is carried not by the "state" but by the "government," the "admin- istration," or the "bureaucracy" or by particular agencies of government like Congress, courts, and political parties. Stephen Krasner goes a great deal fur- ther in specifying the essence of the statist approach. He attributes five characteris- tics to the recent statist literature "that distinguish it from orientations associated with the behavioral revolution" (1984, 224). Echoing a criticism of Theda Skoc- pol, Krasner states that the statist ap- proach views politics more in terms of rule and control than of allocation. Kras- ner does not seem to be aware here of the political science literature on regulatory policy and agencies, on the emphasis in 870</page><page sequence="19">Return to the State the structural-functional literature on extractive and regulative, as well as the distributive, aspects of politics. The early and influential theoretical work of Lowi (1964) whose threefold classification of types of public policy-the regulative, distributive, and redistributive-has had such great influence in empirical political science research, is also unmentioned by Krasner. A second characteristic of the literature is the argument that the state is an actor in its own right. "It cannot be understood as a reflection of societal characteristics or preferences" (p. 225). Here Krasner is sim- ply repeating the myth of the societal reductionism of pluralism. Krasner's third point is that statist studies place more emphasis on institu- tional constraints on individual behavior. Statists, according to Krasner, accord only a very small scope of discretion and initiative at the individual level: "Actors in the political system, whether individu- als or groups, are bound within these structures, which limit, even determine, their conceptions of their own interest and their political resources" (p. 225). On this point Krasner is probably correct. Most mainstream political scientists would draw back from a thoroughgoing deter- minist position. Krasner's fourth contrast has to do with viewing political phenomena in a longi- tudinal and historical perspective. He makes much of the tree model of his- torical choice points, the argument that a particular choice tends to preclude other options. This decision tree model is, of course, a contribution from behavioral social science. The importance of the longitudinal, historical dimension has long been recognized by behavioral polit- ical science, in public opinion and election studies, in the political psychobiograph- ical literature, and in structural-functional analysis. More recently, behaviorist stu- dents of the Congress such as Polsby (1968), Lawrence Dodd (1986a, 1986b), and Cooper and Brady (1981) have ex- ploited the possibilities of the historical approach. Krasner's fifth and final point is that behavioral political science tends to view political phenomena in equilibrium, proc- ess, and compatibility terms and fails to appreciate the importance of conflict and stress. This is difficult to square with the history of pluralism. Pluralism as a nor- mative theory was born out of the strug- gle of economic, religious, and ethnic groups against the overpowering sover- eign state, as well as the effort to conquer the state in order to use its coercive powers to benefit the interests of exploited groups and classes. The pressure group struggle described by Herring, Odegard, Schattschneider, Key and others, hardly took the form of a smoothly purring machine. Political culture research, con- sociational theory, corporatist theory, and development and modernization theory all treat conflict as central themes. Thus with the exception of determinism in the structural sense, Krasner has listed a set of properties that do not demarcate statist studies from the main body of political science literature. Some Concluding Reflections Thus on two of the three grounds named, the statist movement is in error. Its attribution of societal reductionism to the pluralist-structural functionalist ap- proaches is not supported by the prepon- derance of evidence. Its assertion that a statist approach is both different from prevailing views in mainstream political science research and is a distinctly im- proved approach to political explanation also fails to convince. Either it is diffuse or allusive in its formulation of what statism is or its definitions are indistinguishable from "behavioral" or structural-func- tional definitions of things political. More telling, perhaps, is the fact that in pressing their critique of older political science 871</page><page sequence="20">American Political Science Review Vol. 82 approaches to political explanation, the statists have fallen into the trap of neglect- ing nonstatal variables, such as political parties, interest groups, the media of com- munication, and the like. From this point of view it is a distinctly inferior model of political explanation to the models they criticize. If statism fails in its polemic against pluralist reductionism and if its positive formulations do not convince, there still is a third ground on which to give it positive marks-the "heuristic" ground. It is sure- ly the case in the history of scholarship that "stirring things up," even in the absence of substantive merit in a particu- lar intellectual initiative, often proves to have been useful in the net and balance. Scholarly disciplines have a way of set- tling into ruts, becoming repetitive and endlessly replicatory or concerned with trifling modification and emendation of argument. A scholarly tantrum may have the effect of stirring the senses and alert- ing the mind to new possibilities. Aside from generally capturing atten- tion and provoking semantic adaptations on the part of many scholars, it may be argued that statism has drawn attention to institutional and particularly admin- istrative history as a focus for political sci- ence research. This is all to the good. But if this, indeed, is the positive achievement of this intellectual episode, then one has to question why the literature of institu- tional and administrative history was not searched. Why are there no references to the four volumes of L. D. White's admin- istrative history of the United States: The Federalists (1956), The Jeffersonians (1951), The Jacksonians (1954), The Republican Era, 1868-1901 (1958)? Why no reference to White's Trends in Public Administration (1933)? More recently, why no reference to La Palombara's Bureaucracy and Political Development (1963), Ezra Suleiman's Elites in French Society (1978), John Armstrong's Euro- pean Administrative Elite (1973), or Robert Putnam's Comparative Study of Political Elites (1976)? If there is something basically at fault with this literature-and I am sure that the statists, coming from their primarily neo-Marxist and international relationist backgrounds have something novel to contribute to the tradition of institutional history-it is still a fundamental rule of scholarship that one searches the litera- ture before venturing to improve on it. Nevertheless, on this quite limited ground it may be argued that the statist move- ment has performed a constructive role. But at what exorbitant and unnecessary costly A generation of young scholars has been encouraged to reject much of its scholarly ancestry with little more than a paradigmatic farewell. And they have been urged to adopt ambiguous phraseol- ogy in the place of a hard-won tradition of operational rigor. References Almond, Gabriel A., and James S. Coleman. 1960.
