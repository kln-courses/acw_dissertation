<plain_text><page sequence="1">Paul D. Tate Comparative Hermeneutics: Heidegger, the Pre-Socratics, and the .Rgveda The Rgveda is a three-thousand-year-old collection of ecstatic poetry, the oldest document of Indian literature. The collection is composed of a core of related creation stories, presented in various renditions, and a generous pulp of inspired hymns of praise to the divine agencies of creation. The creation stories are remarkable. In addition to the usual cast of divine characters, whose meanings remain obscure, there appear in them certain agencies that we would consider abstract or conceptual. In this respect, the creation stories of the Rgveda are reminiscent of pre-Socratic cosmology. In fact, there are striking parallels between the two. Both reflect, as I will explain later, a subtle and sophisticated insight into the role of language and truth in creation. I have pursued the parallels between Vedic and pre-Socratic cosmology not merely out of the innocent joy of tracing a coincidence in thinking. I find in Vedic poetry an opportunity to put Heidegger's hermeneutical method to the test. For me it was Heidegger who, by his constant appeal to the forgotten significance of pre-Socratic fragments, first unlocked the door to their thoughts, and I suspect that his method can be similarly used to rediscover what is forgotten in Vedic thought. In any case, the very effort to do so will clarify the strengths and weaknesses of the method. Moreover, the .Rgveda provides an opportunity to test one of Heidegger's most controversial historical claims- namely, the claim that thinking began the way it did in Greece because thinking must begin in such a way.' If Heidegger's claim is true, we would expect to find parallels between Vedic and pre-Socratic thinking. The difference between Heidegger's hermeneutical method and the traditional method of interpretation hinges on a difference between what is being asked of a given passage or word. Traditional interpreters ask what a word means; Heidegger asks how a word means. The latter question cannot be answered in terms of the former. For, it cannot be answered in terms of the kinds of things the first question asks about, namely, "meanings," "concepts," "ideas," "objects," and so on-entities of the sort Heidegger calles "quiddities." The hermeneutical question, rather, asks for an illumination of the context that gives rise to the particular usage or meaning of the word, the perspective that makes the usage possible. Context is not a concept or a specific meaning; it is not a quiddity. It is presupposed by a specific meaning. It is evoked in each usage of a word as the ground of the specific meaning of the usage, as that by virtue of which the usage makes sense. It therefore cannot be pinned down by definition or translation of the given usage. For any word used as equivalent to a word evoking a certain context will evoke that context in the same way, will presuppose it as the context that gives rise to the equivalence. The word "context," though suggestive because of the curious ontological status of the "ground" that it names, is not by itself wholly adequate to indicate Paul D.

But hermeneutics aims at the broader context that all usages of a given word have in common, the entire range of associations called to mind by every usage, the region (to use Heidegger's terminology) in which the word works. When Heidegger interprets a word literally-that is, with a graphic metaphor-what he wants to do for his readers is to make more visible the range of associations attached to the word. Etymologies are particularly useful to this effect, since they provide paradigms or simple models with which can be associated the widest range of usage. In this respect Heidegger's hermeneutical efforts are like standard linguistic projects to determine the basic meaning (Grundbedeutung) of a word. A basic meaning is for linguists a theoretical entity of sorts. It is not a usage that may be employed or not employed. It is determined by surveying the various usages of a word to discover what they have in common. A basic meaning cannot be determined by the exegesis of a particular passage, however central or crucial. Nor can it be deduced from its various usages. It must be seen or intuited in them. But the method of its unveiling is not, therefore, arbitrary or subjective. It is no more and no less subjective than the method of Kant's Transcendental Analytic; for, a basic meaning must be understood as the "condition for the possibility" of the various meanings (usages, references) of a word. Heidegger's method is similarly transcendental. The perspectives or contexts that his inter- pretations attempt to make manifest are equivalent to basic meanings. Thus Heidegger can say that his interpretation of a pre-Socratic fragment "never rests exclusively or even primarily on philosophical exegesis."2 The uncovering of basic meanings of words is only one stage in the herme- neutical enterprise. The final goal is the understanding, not just of words, but of a train of thinking. This goal is reached by searching out the broader context that ties together the basic meanings of the words expressing the train of thinking, the context that allows the words to be experienced as related. Every train of thinking, Heidegger believes, revolves around certain key words, the basic meanings of which, taken together, make up an arena within which a philosophical issue can come to be formulated the way it is. Understanding a thinker is understanding this arena-understanding the condition for the possibility of the raising of the given issue, whatever the outcome of the issue might be. It might be called the "basic thought" of a way of thinking. It is basic in the same way that a basic meaning is basic: it is not a particular thought but a range of possible thoughts reflected in a particular thought and required as a condition or ground of that thought. A basic thought in this sense is not the exclusive possession of an individual thinker. It develops historically, like the basic meaning of a word. Thus Hei- degger can say that when he interprets a past thinker, he is repeating the basic thought of that thinker, even if he strays from the "usage" of the basic thought</page><page sequence="3">49 given by the thinker under consideration. Heidegger's interpretations are intended to be renditions of the basic thoughts embodied in a thinker's writing- renditions that, because they are fresher determinations of the possibilities of the basic thoughts, are more illuminative of them. An analogy might make matters clearer. Consider what occurs in the repe- tition of a folk story. A folk story, like a basic thought, is always mediated by a particular personality, a particular manner of expression. But the basic point of the story must be repeated in each rendition or else we will not say that the story has been told. The "point" that is repeated is the perspective that makes the various episodes in the story fit together and be experienced as a story. The point itself, moreover, cannot be explicitly defined or spelled out. The number of episodes needed to convey the story as story will vary from audience to audience, speaker to speaker, depending on the ability of those involved to "get the point." Certain key episodes, of course, will appear to be more essential, more germane to the point of the story. But all episodes will convey the point and be presupposed by it. Similarly, a series of particular thoughts will presuppose a point, a basic thought. Unless particular thoughts are seen as "episodes" of a more fundamental point, we would not say that they are understood. The key episodes in the story of pre-Socratic thought are 16gos, aletheia, and physis. The task of hermeneutics is to render the plot that these words narrate, to express anew the point of view that ties them together. The task is begun by uncovering the basic meanings of the words themselves. Logos is most often translated "Word." Hermeneutics, though, cannot be satisfied with mere translation, however accurate. Hermeneutics must seek out a suggestive metaphor, a signpost to the larger territory where the word roams. Logos must be understood in terms of legein, its verbal root, whose basic meaning Heidegger determines (presumably from examination of nu- merous passages in the available literature) to be "gather" or "collect." Logos is a nomen actionis of this verb: it is both the process and the result of gathering. But it never simply means gathering, in a purely abstract or Platonic sense. Every occurrence of the word indicates a particular sort of gathering-a gathering of grain, perhaps, or a gathering of animals. Heidegger chooses the word "gathering" not to name an abstraction, but to express the "possi- bilities" of the word 16gos. A particular usage is a determination of one of these possibilities, although a usage at the same time embodies the whole range of possibilities as its condition and ground, whether or not manifest. Exegesis and translation are the process of narrowing down a word's possi- bilities to one, on the basis of the position of that word in a given passage. Exegesis is not possible without a prior accounting of a word's basic meaning. When Heraclitus says, "Listen not to me but to the l6gos," he has determined by his usage a kind of gathering that takes place in the arena of speaking and hearing. But we are not, therefore, necessarily to translate the word as</page><page sequence="4">50 Tate "gathering." Rather, we are to understand or interpret the word by associating it with the gathering of entities in a general sense. And we should choose as our translation a word that suggests gathering. I would translate the usage as "context," understanding context as a collection or gathering of entities reflected in each act of meaning. (Heidegger, therefore, finds Heraclitus to be enunciating the hermeneutical principle that led him to his interpretation of Heraclitus in the first place.) The second key word in the story of pre-Socratic thought, aletheia, is com- monly translated "truth." The word "truth," though, has become heavily clothed with a modern theory that we cannot presume to be pre-Socratic. The meaning of the modern notion of truth, the metaphor by which we normally understand it, is "correspondence"-correspondence of word and object, statement and fact. There is, however, no evidence to suggest that the pre- Socratics understood truth in terms of correspondence. The etymological or "literal" meaning of the aletheia suggests a metaphor quite different from correspondence. Aletheia, if Heidegger is right, is a com- pound of the privative prefix a- and the verbal root lath, "to escape notice, to be concealed,"3 and means "uncoveredness" or "unhiddenness." The un- uncoveredness meant is the uncoveredness of logos. Aletheia, is the uncovering of context. That is, truth is the disclosure of the area of concern by virtue of which we perceive the things we do and say the things we say. Seen in this light, aletheia is presupposed by truth understood as correspondence. For something to correspond, it must first be manifest; and for a thing to be manifest, a context of concern must first show itself. The showing-itself of context is what Heidegger takes to be the basic meaning of aletheia (and the "forgotten" meaning of our own word truth). That the Greeks were concerned with the "showing-itself" of context indi- cates that they were concerned with the "how" or with the happening of meaning. This is also to say that they were concerned with the happening of being. For, the context that makes possible speaking and hearing is the same context that makes possible the perception of beings, the context that gives beings their specific "nonlinguistic" meanings and thus their characteristic physical appearances. The words that name the context of meaning are thus closely tied to words that name the "context of being." All such words indicate the happening of the context; they are process words. The Greek word for the happening of the context of being is physis. Like logos and aletheia, physis is both a process and a result. Physis, according to Heidegger, means: self-blossoming emergence (e.g., the blossoming of a rose), opening up, un- folding, that which manifests itself in such unfolding and perseveres and endures in it; in short, the realm of things that emerge and linger on. According to the dictionaryphyein means to grow or make to grow. But what does growing mean? Does it imply only to increase quantitatively, to become more and larger?4</page><page sequence="5">51 In this passage Heidegger invokes several different metaphors with which to render the basic meaning of physis. He is not translating the word but is calling our attention to the "story" of the emergence of being. Concern with the emergence of meaning and being is common to all philo- sophical wonder about the meaning of life. Philosophy begins with such wonder. And this is precisely why philosophy begins in Greece with cosmology. The cosmologies of the early Greeks reflected a concern with the aition of the cosmos. Aition meant that which is responsible for something, and cosmos was originally a political term meaning "social system" or "world" in Hei- degger's sense-the larger context of life, the arena in which life has meaning. That Empedocles should find love to be an aition of his cosmos, or Anaxagoras, mind, strikes us as strange only if we are influenced by the traditional inter- pretation of aition as material cause and cosmos as the physical totality of beings. The pre-Socratics were not proto-scientists trying to discover the material or the efficient cause of the universe. They were concerned with how it happened that the world, the context of life, originated. They were concerned with the origin, in the sense of physis and in the sense of aition, of meaning. Heidegger takes it too much for granted, however, that this thoughtful concern with the question of the aition of meaning and being dawned first among the pre-Socratics. He was influenced perhaps by the tradition of inter- pretation he was so exercised to expose, a tradition that similarly located the first genuine "thinking" in the West in the fragments of the pre-Socratics. But if basic meanings and basic thoughts can only be expressed and not spelled out in definitions and if they are expressed most readily through original, poetic usages of words, then there would be no reason to suppose that concern with them is absent from the so-called mythological cosmologies that precede the cosmologies of the pre-Socratics. That Heidegger does not investigate Homer is understandable: Homer's narratives are not cosmologies in the requisite sense. But why the earlier religious cosmologies should be excluded from investigation, Heidegger does not say. Pre-Socratic cosmologies are clearly developed from these earlier cosmologies, which they resemble struc- turally. The divine agencies in these earlier cosmologies have simply been replaced by the more "conceptual" agencies of Love, Hate, Nous, the Unlimited, and so on.5 There is of course a dearth of information about these earlier cosmologies. We have Hesiod's recapitulations of these cosmologies, but we do not have the actual expressions of the poets who formulated them. Mircea Eliade writes: "Not a single Greek myth has come down to us in its cult context. We know the myths as literary and artistic 'documents,' not as the sources, or expressions, of a religious experience bound up with a rite. The whole living and popular side of Greek religion escapes us, precisely because it was not systematically expressed in writing."6 If we do not have the words themselves, we cannot discern their basic meanings; and if we do not have basic meanings, we cannot discern the basic thought, the context that gives shape to particular concerns.</page><page sequence="6">52 Tate If we turn to the Indian tradition, however, we can read the actual words in which "pre-philosophical" cosmology was narrated. And we can determine the basic meanings of many of these words, for there is a wealth of written material through which to trace their "regions." In the Indian tradition, moreover, we can better see the relationship between mythology and phi- losophy. The gradual eclipse of mythological cosmology by philosophical thinking is well documented in the Brahmanas and Upanisads. The extension of Heidegger's hermeneutical method beyond the boundaries of his own culture will give us some perspective on the conclusions that Hei- degger draws from his investigations. If it could be shown, for example, that the Vedic poets were afflicted with the same thoughtful concern about the origin of meaning and being that Heidegger finds documented in the fragments of the pre-Socratics, then his claim that such thinking began in the West with the pre-Socratics will become questionable. For, it would be comparable to the claim that such thinking began in India with the Upanisads, later works less suffused with mythical narrative, are usually taken to represent the beginning of philosophical thinking in India. But Heidegger's claim that thinking not only does, but must, begin with such concerns, would thereby to a certain degree be vindicated. Prima facie, there is some evidence to support a "Heideggerean" inter- pretation of Vedic cosmologies. In the central creation myth of the Rgveda, Indra, often called Brahmanaspati or Brhaspatti, "Lord of Poetic Formulation," frees the riches of the earth from concealment by uttering certain true brahmani, or poetic formulations. We need stretch our imaginations only a little to see this emergence of beings from concealment as physis and brahman and 16gos, and find here what Heidegger calls the original unity of physis and 16gos. Indeed, the metaphors found in the various renditions of the myth are often suggestive of such an interpretation. Following is one of many similar ren- ditions. (Translations of all Vedic passages are my own.) Like water-swimming birds cry out as they guard (their young), like the noises of a cloud, like the exited waves breaking forth from the mountains, so did the songs sound out to Brhaspati. The friend of the Angirases approached and united (them) with the kine, as fate unites the bridegroom (with his wife), as an ally among the people unites husband and wife. Make our horses strong in battle, Brhaspati. Having overcome (the enemy), Brhaspati cast the kine out of the mountains like barley from sacks, the desirable kine of good color and faultless form, the vigorous ones, which are worthy of true nobles and their guests. Sprinkling the womb of truth with sweetness, like lightning throwing down from the sky a fiery meteor, Brhaspati forced the kine from the rock, and cleft apart the skin of the earth as with a stream of water. With light has he driven the darkness from the atmosphere, as the wind (blows) the lily from the water. Brihaspati, having laid hold of the kine (of Vala), drove them forth from the mountain, like the wind (drives) a cloud. When Brhaspati had cleft apart the hiding place of the scornful Vala with fire-hot lightning, he took (them) out, as the tongue (removes food) stuck in the teeth. He made the treasure of kine manifest.</page><page sequence="7">53 Brihaspati conceived that secret name of those lowing (kine) in that place. He himself drove forth the kine of the mountain, like the young of a bird that has split the egg. He espied the rock-imprisoned sweetness as if it were a fish dallying in shallow water. Having broken (the rock) open with a roaring cry, Brhaspati brought forth (the sweetness) as (a craftsman brings forth) a bowl from timber. He found the dawn, and the light, and fire. With lightning he dispersed the darkness. Like marrow from a limb Brhaspati took out (the kine) from Vala, in whose very body they were. As trees (mourn for) leaves stolen by the frost, so Vala mourned for the kine (taken) by Brhaspati. He did a deed unequalled, never again (to be done), so long as the sun and the moon ascend in turn. The Fathers have adorned the heaven with stars, like a dark steed with pearls. They placed darkness in the night, light in the day. Brhaspati cleft the rock and found the kine. This homage have we paid to the one like the clouds, who thunders out in many (voices). May he, Brhaspati, bestow power on us, along with cattle, horses, heroes, and men. (10.68) In this poem the "lightning," the "roaring cry," with which Brhaspati uncovers the "kine" is understood to be brahman, poetic formulation. The kine may be taken to symbolize the riches of the earth. Vala, the demonic enemy of Brhaspati, is literally "cave," or "concealment." Brhaspati's utterance brings forth the riches of the earth from concealment in the way a craftsman brings forth a bowl from timber. It could be argued easily that this poem is an account of the lighting up that results from the creative word, or even more fundamentally, an account of how language makes possible the appearance of entities as they are. Brahman here is called a "secret name," we might suppose, because the agency that creates is not a particular word that we, too, could utter if we knew it, but the fundamental meaning of the utterance, the context that is the condition for its possibility. Of course, a "one-sided and Heideggerean" exegesis such as this cannot by itself be convincing. Philosophical exegesis is an unreliable tool; it produces as many interpretations as there are interpreters. To discover the content of such passages, the basic thought, the horizon within which such poems can come alive, we must be thoroughly familiar with the basic meanings of key words. And these basic meanings-the broadest regions in which the key words can have sense-can only be determined by careful study of the myriad passages in which the words occur. The most careful and searching account available of the basic meaning of the key word brahman is that given by the German linguist Paul Thieme. Thieme determines the basic meaning of brahman to be "formation."7 That is to say, the word "formation" names the fundamental metaphor, the region of associations, which gets concretized or specified by each individual usage. Thieme finds that the basic meaning, "formation," is most frequently specified in the usage he translates "poetic formulation." He finds a secondary usage in which the formation meant is formation of an embryo, though, in each of the passages he cites, the usage is ambiguous. It may mean in these passages</page><page sequence="8">54 Tate either WahrheitsJormulierung-the formation of words into truth-or the formation of an embryo. For example: When the father mounted his daughter, he spilled semen on the earth in copu- lation. Being of good concern, the gods caused to be born (from it) the brahman and fashioned the Lord of the Home, the protector of commandments. (10.61.7) Commenting on this passage, Thieme says, "Gewiss, 'die Gestaltung' (brahman) kann meinen die erste Wahrheitsformulierung, aus der dann die Welt entsteht, aber es kann auch sein die Gestaltung des ersten Embryo. Das ware eben der vastospati (Lord of the Home). Der Ausdruck ist freilich dunkel." 8 These metaphorical or doppelsinnige usages of the word brahman are possible, Thieme maintains, because there is an obvious, though nowhere explicit, analogy throughout the Rgveda: just as the seed grows in the womb until it is born, so the power of a poet incubates in his mind until it receives expression. Thieme points out that brahman is said to come forth (pra brdhmaitu sddanad rtdsya, 7.36.1) and to grow (brdhma ... vardhaya, 1.10.4). It is also said that a way out for brahman must be found (brdhmane vinda gatum, 7.13.3) or else created (brdhmane gdtuzm eraya, 10.122.2). What these passages confirm, however, is not so much that there exists an implied or metaphorical sense of brahman in which it means formation of an embryo, but that the formation meant by brahman is formation in the sense of being born, of coming forth into the world. That is, these passages establish that the basic meaning of brahman, the fundamental metaphor embodied in the word, must be understood as emergence-emergence into form, emergence into being. It is perhaps not clear whether in its primary usage as poetic formu- lation, brahman means the emergence into form of words (sounds) or the emer- gence into form of meaning. That its original usage by Brhaspati is held to be "secret" is evidence that it is understood to mean emergence into form of meaning, of fundamental meaning, of context, of that which can be expressed but not explicitly or materially grasped. If so, we could see why brahman would be understood as the aition of the being of things. In any case, the determination alone of the basic meaning of brahman without supplementary philosophical exegesis is enough to show in a general way that the creation myth of the Rgveda embodies in its basic thought an association of the coming into being of words and meaning with the coming into being of things, an association that is comparable to the association in pre-Socratic thought of dlgos and phjsis. Indeed, the word brahman by itself expresses much of what is expressed by phjsis. Phjsis, we have seen, is the emergence of the context of meaning. It names the happening that is the ground or the condition for the possibility of the meaning of things and words. This happening, more- over, remains as ground. It is not merely an event, but the "power that emerges and the enduring realm under its sway."9 It is the power of generation, the power of establishing, which endures in its results. Brahman, too, by virtue of</page><page sequence="9">55 its being a nomen actionis, represents at once the process and the result of emergence. That is, the "power" of brahman, like the "power" of physis, lives in the result-the poetic formulation, the words and meanings-as well as in the process-the coming into form of words and thoughts. Brahman not only grows, but causes to grow (indram virdhdd brdhma, 6.38.4). Brahman not only is born (brdmajanayanta, 10.65.11), but also causes to be born (brihmaprajavat, 6.16.36). If we could keep clearly in mind the fundamental metaphor of emergence embodied in the word brahman, we might translate its central usage as "mean- ing." Our English word "meaning" is similarly a nomen actionis: it means both the process of making manifest and the resultant "power" that enables us to use words to make something manifest. Such a translation would make intel- ligible the Vedic notion that "as far as brahman reaches, so reaches speech" (10.114.8). And this notion, in turn, would make intelligible the apotheosis of speech in the Rgveda, expressed so beautifully in the following hymn. Speech (vac) here is a goddess, who narrates: Like water-swimming birds cry out as they guard (their young), like the noises of a cloud, (1) like the exited waves breaking forth from the mountains, so did the songs sound out to Brhaspati. The friend of the Angirases approached and united (them) with the kine, as fate unites the (2) brideroom (with his wife), as an ally among the people unites husband and wife. Make our horses strong in battle, Brhaspati. I travel with the Rudras and the Vasus, I with the Adityas, and with the All-gods as well. I (3) support both Mitra and Varuna, Indra and Agni, both ASvifis. I support the fertile Soma, I Tvastr, and Pusan and Bhaga as well. I bestow wealth upon the (4) sacrificer attentive with oblations, the one who presses (soma). I am the queen, the gatherer of treasures, the perceptive, the first of those who merit worship. (5) The gods have distributed me in many places, having many stations and assuming many forms. Through me he who discerns, who breathes, who bears what is spoken, attains dominance. (6) Without understanding, they depend upon me. Listen, well-known one. I say to you that which is to be believed. I myself, verily, speak that which is enjoyed by gods and men. Him whom I love I make (7) mighty. (I make him) a Brahman, a priest, a sage. I span the bow for Rudra, so that his arrow will kill the enemy of poetic formulation. I cause (8) strife among the people. I enter heaven and earth. At the summit of the earth I brought forth the father. My origin is in the waters, in the ocean. (9) From there I extend over all worlds. I touch even yonder heaven with my height. I blow forth like the wind. I hold fast all worlds. Wider than the heaven and wider than this (10) earth have I become in greatness. (10.125) Speech is clearly appreciated in this hymn as that which makes possible the manifestation (existence) of things. The metaphors are, moreover, much like those Heidegger invokes to explain the pre-Socratics: Speech "gathers" the treasures of the earth, "brings forth" the father of the universe, and "holds together" all existence. These parallels with Heidegger's thought and with his interpretations of the</page><page sequence="10">56 Tate pre-Socratics, however persuasive they might be made by further elaboration, are not in themselves enough to establish that the basic thought of Vedic poets was identical to the basic thought of the pre-Socratics (as Heidegger conceives it). For, just as an account ofphysis and l6gos, if Heidegger is right, is incomplete without an account of aletheia (truth), an account of Vedic cosmology is incomplete without an account of rta, which is often taken to be the central concept of Vedic religion and which I believe is closely analogous to aletheia. The customary translation of the word rtd is cosmic order, though glossaries generally supply a long list of meanings-divine law, rule, sacred custom, faith, the real world, truth, and more. Heinrich Liiders, in a careful study, establishes that rtd in its oldest attestations in the Rgveda is always a substantive and is always associated with the spoken word or with thought. It appears often as virtually interchangeable with brahman. The intimate connection between brahman and rtc can be determined from the properties they have in common. Both brahman and rta are found in compounds with vrdh, "grow." Rtavrdh is an epithet of the gods meaning "growing through truth." Liiders believes that vrdh in this compound must be understood in a figurative sense meaning "elevate" (erbauen, erheben). But the growth of the gods that brahman and rti bring about cannot, I submit, be dissociated from the "literal" meaning of the word-growth as emergence, as quantitative increase. A related epithet of the gods is rtajata, "born from truth." Liiders finds here a personification, but a personification with a specific content: "Uner dem Bilde der Kindschaft fiihrt die vedische Sprache den Gott auf den Begriff zuriick, den sie als den Grundzug seines Wesens bezeichnen will." 16 Liiders thus believes that rtajita can be taken merely as a variant of rtavan, "possessing truth, equipped with truth." Yet, though he says that rtdjata means "ganz von rtd, von Wahrheit durchdrungen," he translates it "aus dem rtd geboren."10 What I am getting at is that we lose something of Vedic thought if we think of the expressions rtdvrdh and rtadjita as "merely" figurative. A figure of speech is (to borrow from the account of meaning so far developed) a usage of a word that is no less a specification of its basic meaning than a more familiar usage. Every usage of a word may vary only within those horizons that are laid out by its "literal" or-what is the same thing-its "basic" meaning. The most literal or basic meaning of a word is a paradigm to which figurative usages conform. We have seen, for example, that Heidegger believes the basic meaning of legein to be "gather," and he says that this meaning is always present in the senses of its various inflections and of its cognates. And I have said that brahman does not mean "formulation" in just any sense, but is always indicative of the paradigm of birth, of coming into being. Similarly, I believe, the occurrence of the expressions rtavrdh and rtdjata, together with the occasional interchange- ability of rtd and brahman, suggests that rtd is to be understood "literally" as giving birth and causing to grow-that is, as bringing into being.</page><page sequence="11">57 What rtd brings into being are the devds, "gods." The word devd is most likely connected with the noun div, "heaven, day." Since the heavens are the source of light, and since day is light itself, we might understand devds as "luminaries." Moreover, the spheres in which the devds move are called devalokd. Lokd is connected with the root lok, "look, see," which in turn is connected with the root ruc, "shine." This network of meanings indicates that the experience of devds was fundamentally the experience of illumination. Rtd was conceived as an agency of illumination. Again, it would be a mistake to take the literal or fundamental meaning of devd as merely figurative and to ignore it in our interpretations of passages about the gods. It is too readily assumed that anthropology alone can give us the meaning of the gods. To be sure, we know that in Vedic society, as in all polytheistic societies, the activity of a god is almost always "pictured as bound to special phenomena and therefore confined to a relatively narrow sphere." 1 According to F. M. Cornford, the gods developed out of totems. Totems are things whose existence and behavior in some way matters to society. A great majority of them are connected with one of our most fundamental interests- food: they are either eatable species, or phenomena (such as wind, rain, sun) on which the food supply depends, or tools used in procuring food.12 We know, too, that the earliest gods "simply consisted of their function; that was all there was of them. Beyond that they had no personality." 13 In the Rgveda such things as clarified butter, the ploughshare, the furrow, and the arrow are taken as devas. The centrally important fire god of the Rgveda is simply agni, the common word for fire. Agni does not become completely personified, and the "anthropomorphism of his physical presence is only rudimentary." 14 But to assume that reverence for such things is a kind of primitive animism, and not to ask how or why such things become illuminative, is to ignore the basic thought of the poetry and miss the content of the thinking. To utter a familiar word as the name of a devd is to utter the word in a very special way, in a way that illuminates. What can a familiar word illuminate? Its own meaning, its cultural content-the sphere of human activity readily associated with it. To name a god must be to draw attention to this sphere, to illuminate it, to make the listener thematically aware of it. To name fire, for example, as a devd, is to evoke the context of activity gathered around fire, the context reflected in cooking, eating, sacrificing, warming oneself, and so on. It is to bring the common meaning of these activities explicitly to mind (and thereby, I believe, to provide the speaker or listener with the experience of cultural cohesion). The name of a god, then, functions very much like what I have called the "name" of a basic meaning: it illuminates or discloses- without "defining"-a horizon of meaning. It should not be thought that the illumination of meaning reflected in the naming of the devds was conceived only as the result of the working of truth. Illumination is associated with that working itself. For, rtd is sometimes</page><page sequence="12">58 Tate replaced by jyotis, "light," as the weapon with which Brhaspdti wrests the "cows" from concealment. Jyotis is used in the Rgveda to mean "inner light." It belongs "in the heart" together with sight and knowledge (6.9.5); it is "in the mouth" (10.67. 10) and is a property of speech (3.10.5). If illumination is both the cause of experience-as jyotis, the light of the creative word-and the essence of experience-as devds the illumination reflected in a sense-making context-then the basic thought expressed here is a transcendental one. That is, the illumination of truth must function for Vedic poets as the "condition for the possibility of experience," as condition that is at the same time ground and structure, cause and essence, of experience. Indeed, light makes the perfect metaphor for a transcendental concept: it is both process and result, agent and state. It will be objected certainly that such tendentious metaphysical language cannot possibly represent the content of these "primitive" mythical narratives. Surely, one wants to say, the Vedic poetic could not have thought that. But hermeneutics does not pretend to recreate assertions or echo concrete concerns. It attempts to understand the basic thought, the conceptual perspective, that gives shape to concrete concerns, even where it remains inexplicit. And concep- tual perspectives are no less embodied in mythical narrative than in philosoph- ical assertion. These narratives could not take the form that they do unless truth were conceived fundamentally as a ground, an aition, a lighting up of context that makes possible speaking and being. If truth were not understood fundamentally as illumination in this sense, it could not be thought-however fancifully or however philosophically-that truth is the essence of creative speech, that truth is inner light, that truth wrests beings from concealment, or that truth supports the being of the universe. Given this fundamental understanding of rta as truth, we can recapitulate the "story" of Vedic thinking. Uninterpreted, the story is this: brahman, because it is rtd, destroys vald. The point of the story is this: the horizon of meaning (the "secret" hidden in words), because it becomes uncovered or illuminated, allows the appearance of entities (destroys the concealment of entities). The story is indentical to the story of pre-Socratic cosmology: logos, as aletheia, gives physis. That is, the context of meaning, showing itself, makes possible the emergence of entities. Both stories reflect an acute sensitivity to language, a special ability to listen through words to the process of meaning that is their foundation. They reflect a sensitivity that is hard to grasp because it has been eclipsed in our own era by a "scientific" approach to language. The story I have sketched of Vedic thinking is, to be sure, a skeletal one. More episodes may need to be considered, more evidence introduced. I hope only to have indicated here the direction that a Heideggerean inquiry of the Rgveda should take. In any case, efforts such as these are demanded by Heideg- ger's hermeneutical program. For Heidegger says that for our own tradition to preserve the power of its beginnings, that is, to remember its beginnings, it</page><page sequence="13">59 must not remain in its Western isolation, but must open itself to "other great beginnings." 15 Indeed, such an opening is necessary if we are to confirm that Heidegger is telling us, as he believes, not merely how Western man has thought, but how man thinks.
