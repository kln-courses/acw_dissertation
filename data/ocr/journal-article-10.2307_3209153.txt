These are difficult questions to which there is no simple answer. It has not been easy to evaluate the relation of the literature of Israel to its environment owing to the fact that the civilization of the Phcenicians, or Canaanites as they called themselves, has been so little known. Excavations in the area of Tyre and Sidon, the center of Phoenician civilization, have been few; and until a few years ago it was believed that the literature of Canaan had been irretrievably lost. To be sure,many parallels between bibli- cal writing and that of the Mesopotamian and Egyptian spheres have been pointed out, but these areas are, after all, considerably more distant from Palestine. So long as little was known of the inner life of Canaan, where the Hebrews settled and developed their political and religious life, it was impossible to make more than limited progress toward the understanding of their distinctive contribution to the world. Today, we-are in a position to progress far beyond the studies of the last generation, because the fog in this area is beginning to lift. The exca- vations in Palestine and in northern Syria, important suburbs of Phoenicia proper, have been contributing, little by little, a store of information. The greatest single discovery has been that of a portion of the long lost reli- gious literature of the Canaanites-the Ras Shamra tablets, which were described by Professor J. Phillip Hyatt in Vol. II, No. 1, of this journal. Convenient and more detailed summaries of the contents of these tablets are now available in W. F. Albright, Archaeology aind The Religion of Israel (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press, 1942), Chapter III, and in C. H. Gordon, The Living Past (New York, The John Day Co., 1941), Chapter VII. Various articles have been and are being written about the connections between the Old Testament and this literature. What can we now say albout our problem ? WHAT CIVILIZATION OWES THE CANAANITES At the outset we should pause to get our bearings, and recall the ex- ceedingly important role which the Canaanites have played in the history of civilization, quite apart from their influence on Israel. Just as the roots of our Western culture lie in the civilization of the Greeks and the Romans, so the roots of the Graeco-Roman culture lay in the Orient, the mediating influence having been the Canaanites (or Phcenicians-after 1200 B.C. the two are synonymous). It is from these remarkable people that the Greeks borrowed the alphabet and passed it on to us, and today nearly all literate people on the globe, with the exception of the Chinese and Japa- nese, use some modified form of the Phoenician alphabet. Innumerable 1.

During the third and second millennia B. C. the Canaanites were in control of practically the whole of Syria and Palestine. Their commercial Fig. 2. Impression from a cylinder seal found at Ur. On the right is Ea, god of wisdom and water, sitting in his chamber in the midst of the "deep" or primeval ocean. In front of him is the sun-god, with sunshine streaming from both shoulders, ascending a mountain to the gate of heaven. Just to the left of him, according to Professor Henri Frankfort's interpreta- tion, is another scene in which he is represented as standing, brandishing his saw, in the midst of the dragon of chaos, Tiamat, whom he has slain in the creation of the world. For the Canaanite version of creation, see Fig. 10. (Courtesy of C. Leonard Woolley, The Royal Cemetery at Ur.) and artistic enterprises were many, one of the chief of which was the manufacture of purple dye. This we know, not only from ancient texts, but also from the names of the country. It has recently been shown that the Greek name "Phoenicia" must refer to the purple industry, and "Canaan", the name by which the inhabitants designated their own land, probably refers to the same thing. The color was derived from the shell- fish or mollusc, Purpura, native to the eastern Mediterranean coast. Tyrian purple through many subsequent ages was the most celebrated of all colors for dyeing. Since it was very expensive, only the wealthy could purchase it, and robes in this color became a mark of high rank, whence the phrase "born to the purple." By the eleventh century B. C., however, a great disaster had over- taken the Canaanite peoples. Isrelites had deprived them of the most of Palestine; Aramean invaders had taken most of eastern Syria; and the Sea Peoples (among them the Philistines) had swept over the Mediter- ranean area like a flood, devastating the Canaanite coastline of Syria and Palestine. In the centuries which followed, having lost nine-tenths of the territory previously occupied, the Phoenicians turned most of their atten- tion seaward and became the greatest sea-trading people of history, found- ing commercial colonies on the shores and islands of the Mediterranean as far as Spain. A vivid description of this activity, the best one we have from antiquity, is to be found in Ezekiel 27, wherein the extensive trade, not only by sea but also by land, is described. Herodotus, the Greek his-</page><page sequence="4">4 THE BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST (Vol. VI, torian of the fifth century B. C., even informs us that a Plicenician fleet had circumnavigated Africa. He says further: "On their return they (the sailors) declared-I for my part do not believe them, but perhaps others may-that in sailing round Libya they had the sun upon their right hand" (Bk. IV. 42). This interesting item, inserted in spite of the author's skepticism, is, of course, just what would happen if one sailed north on the western side of Africa (instead of the hypothetical east-west, parallel to the Mediterreanean, of which Herodotus was apparently thinking, according to the geographical conceptions of his time), and is important witness to the authenticity of the tradition, though we have no other means of testing its validity. ISRAEL'S DEBT TO CANAAN It was inevitable that such an energetic people should have left its mark upon Israel. The Hebrews entered Canaan as a semi-nomadic peo- ple and settled down to a new type of life; and it was the Canaanites who taught them how to d(1 it. Basically, they were heirs of the Canaanite ma- terial culture, continuing to borrow from it throughout the period of the Old Testament. This can be illustrated in numerous ways, but the most striking was in the time of Solomon, when the services of trained Ca- naanites were secured to carry out his numerous architectural activities (see, for example, the article on Sololnon's Temple in Vol. IV., No. 2). Probably more important for civilization was the influence of Canaan upon Isral's literature. From the Canaanites the Israelites learned how to write, and indeed borrowed from them the very alphabet with which the literature is written. Almost one half of the Old Testament is written in poetry, some of it in particular forms that are now known to have been bor- rowed from the Canaanites. For example, a typical device of Hebrew poetry is parallelism, whereby the two halves of a line stand parallel to one another. Thus, "The voice of the Lord is powerful; the voice of the Lord is full of majesty; The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars; yea, the Lord breaketh the cedars of Lebanon" (Psa. 29:4-5). This device was undoubltedly learned from the Canaanites, and is a major reason for the majesty and rhythmic cadence of much Israelite poetry. The Canaanites are now known to have been famous musicians in their time, and Israel undoubtedly borrowed the instruments and learned the art of playing them from Canaan (see Vol. IV, No. 3). In matters of religion the situation is no less striking. The Israelite views of the world order, the sky, the earth, and the underworld were those of Canaan, and for that matter of the Semitic world in general. Burial customs and the view of the after-life were largely the same. So also was the belief, common throughout the Near East, that the proper way to worship was first of all to sacrifice an animal and bring to the sanctuary gifts from the first fruits of the field, the flock, and the herd. Many of the rules by which sacrifice must be made were common proper-</page><page sequence="5">1943, 1) THE BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST 5 ty, and it is now evident that much of the elaborate sacrificial ritual found in the book of Leviticus was borrowed from Canaan. Canaanite influence on Psalms and Proverbs, and allusions to Canaanite mythology in the later prophets and in the book of Job are becoming increasingly clear, and in the years to come we can expect an increasing number of books and articles on these matters. Fig. 3. The Egyptian goddess Sekhmet of the city of Memphis, a fierce goddess of war who was represented as a woman with the head of a lionness. Many other Egyptian deities were thought to manifest themselves as animals: the ibis was a moon-god; the goddess of love and joy sometimes a cow; the serpent a protective goddess; etc. This bronze statuette is dated between about 665 and 525 B. C. (Courtesy of the Oriental Institute.) Even a casual reading of the Old Testament will indicate also that while the enlightened religious leadership of Israel might believe one way, the mass of the people were more tolerant of the ways of the world, adopt- ing many of the practices of their neighbors, until large numbers of them, especially in the early days of the nation, were undoubtedly polytheists, or verging thereon. During the time of Jezebel (9th century) in the Nor- thern Kingdom the state of affairs was so bad that there were to be found only seven thousand who had not bowed the knee to Baal nor kissed him (I Kings 19:18). The day was saved only by the prophetic revolution in- augurated by Elijah and Elisha. In the days of the United Monarchy we hear of kings Saul and David naming their children such names as "Ishbaal", meaning "man of Baal", and "Beeliada", meaning "Baal knows", or "May Baal Know". One of David's warriors even had the name "Bealiah", meaning "Jehovah (Yah-</page><page sequence="6">6 THE BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST (Vol. vl, weh) is Baal". Now it is improbable that Saul and David worshipped the Canaanite god, Baal, but such evidence shows that they were not at all ad- verse to applying the name "baal" to the God of Isral. After the prophetic revolution we do not hear so much of this, and Hosea exclaims: "And it shall be in that day, saith the Lord, that you (Isrel) shall call me 'My'Ish' (husband), and you shall no longer call me 'My Baal'. And I shall take away the Baal names from her (Israel's) mouth and they shall no longer be remembered in (Israel's) name" (Hos. 2:16-17). So great was the borrowing of Israel from Canaan that it has been a common view among Biblical students that before the prophetic reac- tionary movement got under way Israel's religion, like her material cul- ture, was so similar to that of Canaan as to make it virtually impossible to distinguish the two in most vital matters. According to this view it was the prophets, especially those of the eighth century (Amos, Hosea, Isaiah, and Micah), who reacting against this welding of Israel with Canaan, brought to Israel her distinctive religious contribution. This theory is un- doubtedly correct in large measure as regards the state of affairs among the masses of the people. Is it true, however, as regards the religious lead- ers? In the light of all that we know today about Canaanite religion and literature, what must we conclude when we read those portions of the Old Testament which nearly all scholars agree must date between 1100 and 800 B.C. ?2 The answer is clear:' namely, even when we have noted all the si-milarities, the borrowing, and the syncretism, the differeinces between the literature of Israel and that of Canaan are far more renmarkable and signi- fican.t than the affinities! We shall now attempt to examine some of these differences, and in so doing we ought to discover some portion of Israel's great contribution to history. I. OFFICIAL RELIGION OF EARLY ISRAEL NOT POLYTHEISTIC The Canaanites were polytheists, believing in numerous gods. Primi- tive man, conscious of so many forces in this world which he could not control, sought desparately to find an explanation for them in order that he might find some means of alleviating the insecurity of his own position. Naturally he came to the conclusion that nature was alive, full of power, and not to be tampered with. Gradually he identified the various elements of mystery. To him they were persons, and he gave them names. The sun, moon, planets, and stars were personified and named. There were thought to be gods who controlled or were the source of rain, thunder, lightning, vegetation, death, illness, wisdom, life and health, destiny or fate, love and fertility, the arts and inventions, etc. The first remarkable fact about early Israelite religion to be mention- ed, therefore, is that there was no personification of the various elements 2. The following are the most important literary productions from this period on which the conclusions in this paper are largely based: The Song of Deborah in Judg. 5 (about 1100 B.C.); The Blessing of Jacob in Gen. 49 (11th or 10th century); The Blessing of Moses in Deut. 33 (about 900 in the reign of Jeroboam I, or perhaps in the early 8th century in the reign of Jeroboam II); The Balaam Poems in Num. 23-24 (between the 12th and early 8th centuries); the remarkable eye-witness account of David's reign, The Court History of David, in II Sam. 1-20 (about 960-950 B.C.); and the composite literature in that stratum of the of historical books known as The J. Document (final edition in the 10th-9th centuries, most scholars giving the figure about 850 B. C., though miuch of the material is, of course, older).</page><page sequence="7">1943, 1) THE BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST 7 of the universe. All things were believed to have been created by Jehovah (or Yahweh, as the name was probably pronounced). There were no spe- cial gods of rain, vegetation, death, disease, invention, or fertility. All these were merely part of Yahweh's beneficent ordering and ruling of the world. To be sure Yahweh was often conceived as the leader of his peo- ple in war, a God of War, who brought triumph to his people over their enemies (Deut. 33:27ff., for example). He was also particularly associat- ed with Mt. Sinai, so that he has been called a mountain God. He certainly Fig. 4. While most of the gods of Mesopotamia are pictured with human form, there are others which are not. This sealing from Tell Asmar shows the snake-god (whose worship was common throughout the ancient Near East) as a hybrid being with a snake's body and a human torso. (Courtesy of the Oriental Institute.) controlled the weather and the seasons (e.g., Judges 5:4). He is the God who controls fertility in people, animals, and plants, so that he might be called a God of fertility (e.g., Gen. 16:2, 49:25, Deut. 33:13 ff.). Yet this sort of specialization which is so common in polytheistic religion is quite foreign to the Old Testament. Yahweh, and he alone, is the creator and controller of all things in the world, and no one aspect of nature can be singled out as more characteristic of him than any other. Even the conception of Satan as the source of evil does not appear in clear form until the close of the period covered by the Old Testament. In early Israel so great was the theologians' concern for Yahweh as the only source of all things, that evil was occasionally ascribed to him as well as good (I Sam. 16:14, II Sam. 17:14. Compare also II Sam. 24:1 with I Chron. 21:1, where the Chronicler has inserted Satan for Yahweh). II. NO MYTHOLOGY ABOUT GOD IN THE OLD TESTAMENT One of the most interesting facts about polytheism is the peculiar nature of most of its religious literature. The subject matter of this liter- ature is largely concerned with the gods and goddesses and their loves and wars, though an occasional human or semi-human hero is introduced. The elaborate stories apparently had as their primary object the explanation of how the world came to be and how it functions. In Canaan one of the primary questions was about the climatic cycle. Why is it that the rain and vegetation cease during the summer months? Why does the rain begin again at the end of October? Why does the whole countryside spring forth</page><page sequence="8">8 THE BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST (Vol. VI, in verdure in the spring? Canaanite religion gave the answer in a myth- ological story. In the spring the God of Weather and Vegetation (Baal) was killed in a great battle with the forces of Death. This is the reason why the rain ceases to fall and the vegetation ceases to grow. In the fall the rains return because Baal is brought back again to life. In the spring the country is covered with green because of the marriage of Baal with the Goddess of Fertility. In the Old Testament this type of polytheistic mythology is not to be found. There are hints occasionally which may be taken to mean that some people believed in a conflict between Yahweh and the Dragon of chaos in the creation of the world. Yet such a belief was not shared by the the religious leaders who obviously felt it to be a heresy and unworthy of God as he had revealed himself to them, and it was wholly omitted in the early chapters of Genesis. In Gen. 6:1-4 we have the story about the "divine beings" (so the expression "sons of God" should be translated) visiting the daughters of men and producing the "mighty men . . . of old, the men of renown." This would certainly appear to be an old bit of mythology, and perhaps borrow- ed from Canaan. But this story is not about Yahweh himself, but about some of the subsidiary beings. It is thus on the same level as that of Luci- fer as a fallen angel in later Jewish religion. The activity of the God of Israel, thlien, was inot to be seen ii anl ab- stract, unreal mythology, but rather as the direct cause of events in naturc and in history. To Israel history was the scene both of God's blessing and of his judgment. He was to be known, not through artificial and unreal stories, but in the actual events of life. For this reason Israelite religious leaders told and retold the stories of their people's past with much care. What greater lessons for the present and the future are to be found, than those to be seen in the Divine activity of the past? Thus in the Hebrew nation history became sacred and important, and was viewed as the scene of moral judgment in almost complete contrast to the preoccupation of the surrounding peoples with polytheistic mythology. This point of view is the basis of the Judeo-Christian interpretation of history today, and is one of the great contributions of Israel to civilization. III. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ANTHROPOMORPHISM In the early strata of Old Testament narrative, especially, God is described in very human terms. He walks, talks, makes things, is pleased, gets angry, repents. He is believed to have a body with face, back, arms hands, and feet. In other words, God is thought of as a great Man, the greatest and finest Man who could be conceived. Now it has been customary to explain this as a fairly low conception of God from which Israel gradually emerged. While it is true that later lit- erature is not so outspokenly anthropomorphic, we should attempt to do justice to the importance of the early conception. Ancient polytheists in and around Israel did not conceive of their gods as abstract principles. They were beings with definite form. But apparently people had not yet</page><page sequence="9">1943, 1) THE BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST 9 made up their minds about the primacy of man among the created beings. There was no clear or fixed conception of what deity was like. Gods were pictured as human beings, animals, birds, snakes, or hybrid forms made up of almost any combination of elements. There was thus little stability in the conceptions of the nature of the gods, primarily because there was no unified view regarding the relative importance of the various levels of created beings. Perhaps, after all, the bull or the serpent were more impor- tant in the sight of the gods than were men. Fig. 5. Two cherubim guarding the tree of life, a common motif in Canaanite art. They were hybrid beings apparently considered to be in the service of the gods. While Israelites believed in their existence, they occupy no prominent place in the conception of God and of his gov- ernment of the world. In the Old Testament, however, there is no doubt about the matter. Man and God have a fundamental similarity, both physical and mental, which exists between God and no other of his creatures. Man is the high- est and greatest created being, and more nearly like God than anything in the animal world. Accordingly, there is a special relationship existing between God and man, a relationship which can exist between God and no other creature, because of the very nature of God's creative acts. The old uncertainty in the polytheistic world is cleared away, therefore, with one stroke, and the subsequent development of the Jewish-Christian religion made possible. It should also be pointed out that the God of early Israel, as an ideal- ized Man, was no abstract idea which cannot be made concrete and real. He was a God who was living, active, powerful. This so-called "anthro- pomorphism" of conception was indeed a primary source for the dynamic, virile, and ethical character of Israelite religion, and it may be argued that such a view is actually more valid than some modern definitions of God as the principle of integration or concretion, or the sum of human ideals, or the vital energy regulating and ordering matter. From the Israelite point of view such conceptions run into the same danger as does polythe- ism: that of abstracting certain forces of nature and making them into in- dependent Gods.</page><page sequence="10">10 THE BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST IV. THE GOD OF ISRAEL STOOD ALONE A most remarkable fact about the early Isrelite conception of God is that he was believed to stand alone, with no other being on or near his level. His power was to be seen even in Egypt, where it was recognized by Israel as superior to that of the gods in whom the Egyptians believed. He had no wife or family. In fact, biblical Hebrew possesses no word for Fig. 6. A representation of the Canaanite mother or fertility-goddess. This type of plaque is rarely found after the 12th-11th centuries. (From Grant, Beth-shemesh, p. 35.) "goddess". Enlightened religious circles, at least, apparently did not believe in the female aspect as necessary to explain the working of the world, though to be sure many tolerant Isrelites compromised their heritage in worshipping the gods and goddesses of Canaan. (We must be careful to distinguish, however, between the beliefs of the religious leaders and those of the unenlightened masses.) The leaders did believe that there were a number of divine beings associated with God in his rule of the world. Thus we hear of "angels" -(literally "messengers") of God who come to earth (Gen. 16:7, 18:2, 19:1). Joab and Meribaal (Mephibo- sheth) honor David by comparing him to an "angel of God" (II Sam. 14:17, 19:27). Such "angels" were probably thought to be members of a general "host of heaven" (I Kings 22:19) with whom God took counsel (cf. Job 1:6. Gen. 3:22 and 11:7 may possibly be interpreted in this light). The reference in Genesis 6 to the "sons of God" or "divine beings" who came to earth has already been mentioned. At least as early as the ninth century such beings were probably classed with the "angels". All were subject to Yahweh's control and owed their existence to him. Thus in the period of early Israel under consideration we have a belief in a (Continued on Page 13)</page><page sequence="11">1943, 1) THE BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST 13 supreme deity surrounded by a group of subsidiary beings. In later times Christians, Jews, Mohammedans, and even the philosopher Plato likewise believed in a heavenly court of angels or divine beings, presided over by a supreme deity. Today there is a debate among scholars as to how we should label the religion of early Israel. W. F. Albright in Front the Old Stone Age to Christianity (The Johns Hopkins Press, 1940) maintains that it is mono- theism, and that even Moses was a monotheist: "If . . . the term 'mono- Fig. 7. A pillar figurine depicting the Canaanite mother or fertility-goddess. This type of figure is so common is Israelite Palestine that we must assume that the average Israelite home had one or more of them. It is thus good evidence of the paganism among the common people. (From Grant, Ain Shems, Pt. 111, pl. 23.) theist' means one who teaches the existence of only one God, the creator of everything, the source of justice, who is equally powerful in Egypt, in the desert, and in Palestine, who has no sexuality and no mythology, who is human in form but cannot be seen by human eye and cannot be repre- sented in any form--then the founder of Yahwism was certainly a mono- theist" (p. 207). Other scholars, however, do not accept this view and believe that the terms "henotheism" or "monolatry" are more adequate designations of the real character of the religion. Henotheism is defined by Webster as "the belief in one god, not to the exclusion of belief in other gods"; and monolatry is "the worship of one god, although more than one may be recognized as existing". A solution of the problem acceptable to all is difficult. Early Chris- tianity, Judaism, Mohammedanism, and Platonism are usually given as classic examples of monotheism; and if so, we cannot deny the term to early Israel solely on the ground of a belief in angels or subsidiary beings</page><page sequence="12">14 THE BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST (Vol. VI, under God's control. The problem really revolves around the answer to this question: did the leading religious thinkers of early Isrel believe that the gods of the people about them really existed, andl were comparable in power to the God of Israel? The first commandment has been translat- ed: "Thou shalt have no other gods 1before me" (Exod. 20:3). This cer- tainly sounds as though there was a belief in other gods, since the com- mandment merely says that they shall not be put before Yahweh. The Hebrew is to be translated literally, however, as follows: "There shall not be to you other gods uponi (or over) iniy face." Since there is no agree- ment on just what that last expression means2a, it is better to turn to other passages, the meaning of which is quite clear. There are several verses which have the same essential meaning as Exod. 15:11 (though the date of this particular passage is considered to be later than the period under discussion here): "Who is like unto thee among the gods, O Yahweh!" The sentiment here is that among all the gods of the world none can be compared to the God of Israel; and the phraseology is almost identical with that used by good polythe- ists to honor their deities. A seal found at Hamath in Syria bears an in- scription in which are the words:"Who can rival thee, O Lady of E-anna!" The Babylonian god Marduk has this said about him: "Lord, thou art ex- alted; who can rival thee ? Marduk, among the gods as many as are called by name, thou art exalted !"3 Similar passages in the Old Testament, thereforc, if examined outside their total context, could easily be taken as evidence of polytheism as well as of henotheism. The question is: how did orthodox Isralites interpret the meaning of such expressions? Are they really evidence of henotheism in early Israel or are they accommodations to the customs and phraseology of the time? There can be no doubt that good Jews from the fifth century B.C. read this verse and others like it monotheistically, and "the gods" mentioned had no more real existence to them than do the gods of Burma to us. The monotheistic Chronicler puts these words in the mouth of Solomon: "for great is our God above all gods" (II Chron. 2:5). A recent commentator has been able to find very few definitely monotheistic Psalms, and yet all scholars are agreed that most of the composers of the Psalms and the worshippers who used them in the Second Temple were certainly mono- theistic. When did this type of wording lose its implied belief in other 2a. Professor Albriaht informs me that he now believes that this commandment must be trans- lated with the Greek and Aramaic and finds support in the sacrificial tariff from Marseilles where the preposition in question occurs with the meaning "in addition to, besides". Thus he believes that the commandment means: Thou shalt have no other gods in addition to or besides me. Professor Burrows writes: "Whatever the exact shade of meaning, the implica- tion is certainly not 'ahead of me' but something like 'in my presence.' What is pro- hibited is that Israel should have no other gods than Yahweh. Whether or not such gods really exist, Israel must not worship them." Professor Meek has written: "in most occur- rences the particular meaning of the phrase intended is indicated with more or less certainty by the context, but in the case of the First Commandment the context is altogether too slight to indicate explicitly what meaning was intended" (Journal of Biblical Literature, 1942, p. 25). 3.

Was it in the sixth century, the eighth, the ninth, the tenth, or in the time of Moses? This question is not easily answered, and there is little room for dog- mnatism. The attempt to impose clear-cut distinctions upon Isrel is a very difficult thing to do. The period of early Isrwel is a transitional one, when the battle between monotheism and polytheism was in full sway, and when among groups of people there were certain to be all shades of opinion, from outright polytheism among the masses to the loftier conceptions of the leaders. Modern distinctions of analytical logic were entirely foreign to Isrwel, and it is always difficult to impose such distinctions on people Fig. 8.

This type of figurine, while common in Canaanite cities, is not found in Israelite towns. (From B.A. Vol. II. 1.) who have no idea of, formal logic. To this writer the following seems to be a fair summary of the present state of our knowledge: Whether between the thirteenth and ninth centuries there were a few men in Israel who actually believed that no other gods existed but Yahweh, is something we do not surely know. It is certain, however, that there were those who held that Israel must not worship anyone or anything but Yah- weh and him alone, and that this God of Israel was all-powerful on earth, even in Egypt with all its might, splenzdor, and great gods of hoary anti- quity. It is also certain, from what has been said already and from what is to follow, that the nature of Israel's religion as we know it from the lit- erature written between the eleventh and eighth centuries was remarkable and different, a radical mutation among the religions of the earth. These are the important points to be kept in mind as the discussion of the exact, descriptive, anthropological term which is to be applied to the religion con- tinues.</page><page sequence="14">16 THE BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST (Vol. VI, V. THE PROHIBITION AGAINST IMAGES A fifth remarkable fact about early Israelite religion is the command- ment: "Thou shalt make thee no molten gods" (Exod. 34:17; cf.20:4).The plethora of idols among Israel's neighbors is eloquent testimony to the dis- tinctiveness of this prohibition. It is interesting to note that archaeology offers support for the anti- quity of this commandment in Israel. No where can we place our hands on a figure of Yahweh among the excavated ruins in Palestine. Of course, one would immediately ask: how do we know what god a small male idol represents? But the interesting fact is that Canaanite cities possess a large series of copper and bronze figurines of gods, most of which are identified with Baal (Figs. 8 - 9). Yet when we turn to Israelite towns, the series gives out. Israelites were certainly familiar with them as we know from the denunciations (cf. Hal). 2:19, Isa. 40:19, Jer 10:14). Yet in the city of Megiddo, for example, a tremendous amount of debris was moved from the first five town levels (all probably Israelite), and not a single example of a male figurine of this sort has been found. As far as the writer has been able to learn front the published reports, the same is true in other Israelite towns. At the same time, however, large numbers of figurines representing the Canaanite mother-goddess or fertility-goddess are found in every excavation into Israelite houses, indicating that among the common people almost every home must have had one or more of them (Figs. 6 - 7). They are indisputable evidence of the widespread syncretism, verging on polytheism, among the masses. It is most surprising that we do not find an occasional male image among such unenlightened and tolerant circles, and very likely examples will some day turn up. The fact remains, how- ever, that most of the people of Israel apparently thought that Yahweh was simply not honored in that way. A few superstitions might be bor- rowed from Canaan, but this was not one of them. The antiquity of the second commandment thus receives support, and by implication also the first crmnandment; and these two prohibitions are certainly among the distinguishing features of early Israelite religious belief, lifting it high above the practice of surrounding people. V. THE UNION OF RELIGION AND MORALITY In a typical polytheistic setting religion and morality rarely go to- gether, a fact scarcely surprising when we recall that the deities are per- sonifications of natural forces and phenomena. The lives of the gods ap- pear to have no standard of morality whatever governing their actions. In fact, they are on an ethical level below that of the average of society as a whole, if we may judge frolm the ancient codes of law. In Israel, how- ever, the opposite was true. To be religious there meant that one must also be moral, for God was a righteous God who demanded of men obedi- ence to his laws. Of course, the exact content and interpretation of the laws varies with the century and point of view, but the basic moral re- quirement remained. And as early as the tenth century, we find that this</page><page sequence="15">1943, 1) THE BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST 17 moral requirement was high, even if we judge only from Nathan's para- ble, upholding the rights of the poor man against the selfishness of the rich, and from David's consciousness of sin in the Bathsheba incident (II Sam. 12). The worship of Yahweh required the best of man, and this is surely a most distinctive element in the early religion of Israel. In this connection it may be pointed out that there has been a great deal of interesting and important study on early Israelite law. The laws of the Babylonian king, Hammurabi, dealing exclusively with social legisla- tion, contain many parallels to the same type of legislation found in Exo- dus 21 - 23. Since the discovery of that code, some of the Hit- tite and Assyrian laws have been found. The biblical laws, however, Fig. 9. A bronze figurine, covered with old leaf, found in a Canaanite temple at Megiddo. Idols such as this and Fig. 8 were the "graven and molton images of the Old Testament. (Courtesy of the Oriental Institute. are now seen to be closest to those of Hammurabi, yet the resemblances are not sufficiently detailed to signify direct dependence of the one upon the other. Many of these laws were apparently the common property of the Babylonian and Canaanite worlds, and thence they came to Israel. Recently, Albrecht Alt, a German scholar, has pointed out that in general there are two types of law among the oldest formulations in the Old Testament. He calls them the casuistic and apodictic types. The cas- uistic laws always begin with "if" (or "provided that"), are in the third person, and have to do with purely secular matters. Thus Exod. 22.1: "If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it, he shall restore five oxen for an ox and four sheep for' a sheep." Such law, like English Common Law, is the product of numerous decisions of judges and only gradually came into being as the need arose. In formulation and in gener- al subject matter it is exactly like the laws of the Hammurabi, Hittite,</page><page sequence="16">18 THE BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST (Vol. VI, and Assyrian codes, and there can be little doubt that it was borrowed by Israel and selectively modified for her own needs. On the other hand, there is another type of law in apodictic or com- mand style. Its characteristic formulations are short, semi-poetic, and easily remembered, usually in the second rather than in the third person, and always have to do with religious matters or else presuppose a reli- gious background. The commandment style, "Thou shalt not do so-and- so", is the clearest illustration of the type. Other examples can be seen in Lev. 18:7 ff. and Deut. 27:15 ff. Laws of this style do not have the same subject matter as do those of the "if" or casuistic style. Religion, custom, and law are here mixed and undifferentiated. For this style there is no close Near Eastern parallel. It appears to be characteristically Israel- ite-another feature distinguishing early Israel from her neighbors.4. VII. ISRAEL A COVENANTED GROUP One of the fundamental conceptions of Israelite theology was that of the covenant, a conception originating as the legal basis of society and used to describe the special relationship believed to exist between Yahweh and his people. Israel even in the early period of her national life was apparent- ly keenly conscious of having been chosen by Yahweh and in turn of having chosen him of her own free will. In patriarchal and nomadic soci- ety covenants or agreements between men and groups were the legal ar- rangements which made peaceful community relations possible. In such agreements the deities of the respective groups were made parties to the covenant and would see to it that it was kept (cf. the Mizpah Benedic- tion, Gen. 31:49). The deity, therefore, made the covenant absolutely bind- ing, and religion was the very basis of the stability of a society which had no strong central government. In the period of the Wandering, Conquest, and Settlement that which held the various groups together was a religious bond or covenant made directly between God and the people (cf. Exod. 24, Deut. 33: 8 ff., Josh. 24). This conception formed the basis of the whole Israelite conception of society. It is a convenanted society, and for it there is no direct Near East- ern parallel. The Old Testament conception of righteousness and justice is to be explained in this background. Righteousness was no abstract principle, but primarily the maintenance of the covenant, while sin was transgression, a breach of the covenanted obligations. God was the ground and source of righteousness, and violating his law meant the breaking up of the covenant community, though the positive, personal and intimate quality involved in the relationship created the possibility of reconstruct- ing the broken bond. VIII. THE RULER-SERVANT MOTIF IN EARLY ISRAELITE RELIGION In the New Testament the relationship between God and man is conceived as one between a benevolent father and his children. As the 4. Alt, Die Urspruenge des israelitischen Rechts (1934). Once the two types of formulation were present in Israel, they were naturally mixed: for example, Exod. 21:2, where the sec- ond person of the apodictic style is introduced into a typical casuistic law which originally was probably in the third person.</page><page sequence="17">1943, 1) THE BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST 19 father loves his children, so the children should love their father. In the Old Testament, however, this father-son picture is significantly rare, though it was increasingly used after the seventh century (cf. Mal. 1:6, Deut. 32:6, etc.). The terminology of the official religion of early Israel is primarily centered around the conception of God as "lord", "sovereign", or "ruler" (and therefore also as judge, lawgiver, warrior, and saviour), and of man as the "servant" or subject of the ruler. Thus "to be religious" is expressed by the word "to serve" or by the word "to hearken, to be obedient". The Ruler gives to his servants his law, statutes, and com- mands by means of his messengers, and it is the duty of the servants to pay heed, to be obedient, else they are sinners (that is, "disobedient" or "rebellious"). To be sure, Hosea introduces a new motif, the husband- wife relationship, wherein Israel is said to be an adulterous wife to Yah- weh; yet this terminology is comparatively rare in a scene otherwise dom- inated by the Ruler-servant picture. Fig. 10. An impression of a cylinder seal found at Tell Asmar in Mesopotamia. Two deities are represented as destroying a seven-headed serpent-dragon. Four of the heads are subdued, while three are still fighting. This scene probably represents the version of the creation which became popular in Canaan, wherein Leviathan, the seven-headed monster of chaos, was slain at the beginning of the world's history. The typical Mesopotamian version of creation may be represented in Fig. 2. (Courtesy of the Criental Institute..) The question is: why was the father-son terminology so rare? VWe know that it was known and largely used by the Canaanites, just as was the ruler-servant motif. It seems apparent that leading religious minds at least as early as the 10th-9th centuries in Israel were reacting against some- thing in Canaanite religion which they did not think was worthy of their conception of God. This was apparently the physical connotations of fatherhood and the tendency to think of man as in some more or less lit- eral sense the "son" of some deity. Jeremiah seems to have reference to such a Canaanite belief when he refers to idolators who say "to the tree my father art thou, and to the stone thou hast borne me !" (2:27). Further elaboration of this point is impossible here,5 but it is highly probable that it is another significant difference between early Israel and Canaan. 5. The subject is elaborated in the writer's article, "The Terminology of Old Testament Religion and its Significance," Journal of Near Eastern Studies, Vol. I, No. 4 (Oct. 1942), pp. 404 ff.</page><page sequence="18">20 THE BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST IX. EARLY ISRAELITE TRADITIONS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD It has long been known that the official Israelite view of world origins as seen in the early chapters of Genesis is more closely allied with Babylonian sources than with those of any other people. It is also gener- ally believed that other elements, such as the Nimrod account, the Flood, and the Tower of Babel, point to further Babylonian influences. As Pro- fessor Bright pointed out in the last number of this journal, there are remarkably close parallels between the biblical account of the Flood and a similar tradition in ancient Babylonia, but none at all exist between it and the literature of other countries of the Near East. Now it is a legitimate question to ask how it happened that a coun- try remote from Israel should have had the most influence upon her ideas of origins? The explanation once popular was that these ideas were me- diated to Isrel by her Canaanite neighbors. Yet this theory is scarcely valid today in view of the fact that Canaanite mythology has been discov- ered in large part and that no resemblances have been found to the ac- counts in question. Some scholars have tried to explain the problem by as- suming that the borrowing on the part of Israel was late: that is, eighth century or after, when the Assyrian armies were in control of the Near East. Yet this theory is so full of difficulties that the majority of scholars have not accepted it, favoring a much earlier date. Today the only other possible solution is to assume that much of the material in the stories of Creation, Paradise, the antediluvian patriarchs, the Flood, and the Tower of Babel, could only have reached Palestine with fhe Patriarchs during the period between 2000 and 1500 B.C. Other wise, how can we explain its presence in Israel in the ninth century to the exclusion of the Canaanite mythology, especially the story of creation through the slaughter of the seven-headed serpent-dragon Leviathan? To be sure, there are sufficient hints from various sources to indicate that a popular story about Yahweh's killing of Leviathan was current among many people in Israel, but it was considered heretical by the religious leaders. Here the listing of differences must conclude, though there are still other things to which one could point. We have seen that though the manner of Canaan did exert great influence upon Israel, yet there was among the Hebrews in the tenth-ninth centuries, before the period of the classical prophets, a distinct cultural and religious pattern which was new, different, and dynamic. It was so strong and resistant that altered living conditions, and changes in political and social structure in Canaan, failed to compromise it seriously, though it was in constant danger of such compro- mise. Israel, while living with her neighbors, borrowed widely, and yet transformed all that was borrowed while it was being absorbed, combining it into a new and richer synthesis. The ability to see this clearly and to describe it in detail we owe to the vast accumulation of archaeological dis- coveries and to the patient labors of many scholars. SALE: Vols.
