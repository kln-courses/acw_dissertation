<plain_text><page sequence="1">Pavel Filonov: His Painting and His Theory By JOHN E. BOWLT Intuition as the highest form of consciousness and as the way to tran- substantiate impressions of inner life into outer forms-that is the main- part of Filonov's doctrine. Arapoval The substantial heritage of paintings, drawings, and theoretical essays left by Pavel Nikolaevich Filonov (1883-1941) is known only to a handful of collectors and scholars. Yet as an artist, thinker, and teacher, Filonov rightfully deserves a foremost position in the history of twentieth-century Russian and West European art. General ignor- ance or rejection of his work can be explained by a variety of reasons: his paintings and drawings, now mostly in the State Russian Museum, Leningrad, remain relatively inaccessible, scarcely represented in Western public and private collections; little material has been pub- lished on him; and his general position vis-a-vis the Soviet Establish- ment is, to say the least, one of uncertainty.2 To scholars interested in modern Russian art, such circumstances are common and do much to explain the general unfamiliarity with such great figures as Kliun, Matiushin, and Rozanova. But in the case of Filonov, there is one other distinctive, perhaps even principal, reason why his works are so little known or so little appreciated-and that is because they are extraordinarily ugly. Filonov's work does not have the basic harmony of colors found in Kandinsky or Malevich; it does not contain that joie de vivre and 1 Iu.

Filonov's work is as unaesthetic as a piece of stone, a tree, a human head. Quite unlike a Larionov rayonist piece, a Kandinsky improvisation, or a Malevich suprematist painting, it is essentially figurative, although rarely comprehensible. Filonov emphasized the "fallacy in any argument [which could sup- port] the existence or possibility of existence of so-called 'pure art' devoid of content, of 'art for art's sake' or of 'art as an end in itself'."3 While Filonov never regarded himself as a realist in the nineteenth- century or Soviet sense-defining Soviet realists as pictorial valiut- chiki (currency speculators)4-art for him most certainly had a higher, extrinsic mission. He considered his own artistic system, his so-called "universal flowering"2 or "analytical art," to be the "ultimate stage of socialism and the emancipation of the individual . . ,"5 an attitude which reminds us both of Malevich's suprematism in its later devel- opment and of an essential aspiration of the surrealists. Yet in spite of this utilitarian purpose and his frequent use of the word intellekt in his explanations of analytical art, Filonov's painting relied on a highly subjective world view-above all, on the application of intuition, the basic element of a concept which Filonov termed "organic aesthetics." Filonov's reliance on intuition connects him, of course, with many Russian artists of the modernist era who saw that faculty as the key to the discovery of authentic perception, of that "secret rhythm . . behind the outer covering of every object."6 In the case of Guro, Kul'bin, Larionov, Malevich, Matiushin, and Rozanova, in fact, the intuitive urge was the path to reality (realrnost'), a postulate which at once betrayed their debt to symbolist philosophy and anticipated, again, the surrealist credo. It is not-the task of this essay to examine the various comprehensions of intuition among the members of the Russian avant-garde. Filonov's concept is loose and ill-defined; he, in fact, seems to equate true intellect with intuition and not with an 3 P.

It would be tempting to assume that Fil- onov had read Bergson, that he knew symbolist and theosophist theory, but we have no documentary evidence to support such an assumption. Like Malevich and Tatlin, Filonov was not well read and had received no higher education other than art courses. The critic Punin was well aware of this when he criticized such "indubit- able inventors" as Filonov, Malevich, Matiushin, and Tatlin for their low cultural level, implying that true creativity was more than in- genuity.7 To compare a Filonov painting to a natural phenomenon is not to denigrate its "artistic" quality. On the contrary, Filonov, in his at- tempt to recapture a pristine state of mind, strove to create the work of art as if it were a living thing. For Filonov, the canvas was a piece of fertile earth to be sown with a multitude of seeds from the artist's spirit: the artist was responsible for every atom of the pictorial sur- face, no space was to be left uninhabited, any complexity of form and color stemming from his intuition could be incorporated into the picture. As a result, the tentacular lines, exotic color combinations and lush facture of Filonov's paintings (especially of the later period when the analytical theory was fully developed) are reminiscent of some fantastic artistic Matto Grosso. The subjects of Filonov's- pic- tures often relate to a rural, zoological or primitive environment and present a cohesive, organic hierarchy of man, beast, and plant. Of course, this restoration of a natural order and the constant interfusion of living forms had precedent in the history of modem painting: Henri Rousseau (le Douannier) in France and the neo-primitivists in Russia (the Burliuks, Goncharova, Larionov, Shevchenko) had sought a more natural, more organic conception of reality by applying meth- ods unadulterated by academic conventions. On this level, there are pronounced affinities between, say, Larionov and Filonov: both transfer a monoplanar arrangement of forms from primitive, infantile, and oriental art forms to their professional painting, thereby return- ing the picture to its legitimate two-dimensional quality. Both ap- proach what the German expressionists called so conveniently ein Nahbild, a composition wherein the action is brought up to the sur- 7 Dairy of N.

At the same time, however, there exists a wide gap between Filonov and his neo-primitivist colleagues: a visual density, an exacting concentration on every part of the picture, an apparent disorder.of forms, and a process of visual complexity rather than of simplification distinguish Filonov immediately from. Larionov or Rousseau and bring him closer to Beckmann, Kirchner, or Meidner. The reason for the curious and extreme accumulation of forms in Filonov's paintings may be found in his own theoretical construction of reality: "'Realism" is a scholastic abstraction of only two of the object's predi- cates: form and color.... [My principle] activates all the predicates of the object and of its orbit: its own reality, its own pulsation and that of its orbit, its biodynamics, intellect, emanations, interfusions, geneses, processes in color and form-in short, life as a whole. My principle pre- supposes the orbit not as mere space but as a biodynamic entity.... in which the reality of the object and its orbit is eternally forming and transforming its coloristic and formal content and its processes (this is absolute analytical vision).8 In other words, the artist is to depict the whole complex of properties identifiable with any organic thing, knowing that the chemical and biological processes occurring therein influenced its development in time as well as space. This very original conception of the artist's task allowed Filonov to suspend conventional sequences of time and meaning: unlike a realist work, the visual sequence across the surface of the canvas (a narrative sequence and, therefore, a temporal one) turns into a "non-sequence" in a Filonov analytical painting, i.e., into a constant interfusion of past, present, and future. This destruction of the single temporal progression and, consequently, of the semantic axis brings to mind surrealism, although Filonov's work could not be accommodated adequately by that term: his paintings do contain an inner coherence, even though their subjects may contain elaborations on many levels. Examples of this fragmented unity are the pictures based on formulae such as Formula of the Cosmos (1918-19), Form- 8p.

In all these paintings, Filonov started with a basic, mundane concept, normally at the center of the composition, and then proceeded to break it up and confuse it with those processes and reverberations which his intuition evoked. How did Filonov acquire his idea of the multi-predicative picture? Filonov began work on his theory in 1913-14 and reached his defin- itive conclusions by the mid-1920s, although his teaching work in his Collective of Masters of Analytical Art (1925-33) prompted him to rethink certain of his tenets. He drew on various stimuli, not least Iul'bin's own organic approach to art,9 and although it reminds us at times of the theory of simultanism10 and of non-Euclidian geom- etry, Filonov's conception of reality owed a great deal to the Old Masters, particularly to Hieronymus Bosch and Pieter Breughel the Elder. It is important to note that as far as we know Filonov never visited the Netherlands or Madrid (the main depositories of Bosch) and could only have seen isolated originals during his brief visit to Italy and France in 1913; however, Filonov's maturation as an artist coincided with the universal reappraisal of Bosch and Breughel after centuries of neglect, and he would have been acquainted with the several relevant articles and reproductions which appeared in Russia at that time.1 Our argument is lent support by the fact that Filonov makes explicit reference to Bosch in his manuscripts. First and foremost, it was the cultivation of line as a sensitory force (basic to Filonov's work) which attracted him to Bosch and Breughel, although other elements-fantasy and allegory, preoccupation with eschatological symbols, a common sense of imminent, universal trans- formation-also occasioned his interest. If we compare an early Filonov such as The Hero and His Fate (1909-10, RM*) or Heads 9 Some idea of Kul'bin's "organic" approach to art can be gained from two of his articles: "Svobodnoe iskusstvo, kak osnova zhizni," in N. Kul'bin et al., Studija Impres- sionistov (St. Petersburg, 1910), pp. 3-14; and "Kubizm," Strelets, 1915, no. 1, pp. 197-216. 10 Of particular interest here are Iakulov's ideas of luminosity-ideas which, he claimed, Delaunay borrowed from him, incorporating them into his own theory. See S. Aladzhalov, Georgii Iakulov (Erevan, 1971), p. 37 ff. 11 See, for example, A. Trubnikov's essay "Demonizm leronimusa Boskha," Apollon, 1911, no. 3, pp. 7-16. * RM = State Russian Museum, Leningrad; TG= State Tret'iakov Gallery, Moscow.</page><page sequence="6">Pavel Filonov: His Painting and His Theory 287 (1910, RM) (fig. 4) with one of Bosch's last works, Christ Bearing the Cross (ca. 1514, Musee des Beaux-Arts, Ghent), resemblances are striking: both painters fill the primary plane of the canvas to the maximum, both concentrate on frontal and lateral views of faces, using them, as it were, to create a kaleidoscope of moods and emo- tions, both practically ignore background or secondary action. Of course, Filonov offers no parallel to the remarkably subtle diagonal structure of Bosch, preferring a much more straightforward visual arrangement, although this initial simplicity of design was rapidly replaced by a terrifying complexity. This becomes apparent, for ex- ample, if we compare a Bosch such as The Garden of Earthly Delights (ca. 1510, Prado, Madrid) with Filonov's Entry Into the Flowering of the World (1919-20, TG). However fertile the imagination of Bosch, there is no doubt that the society in which he lived, nurtured on an intricate symbology of deviltries, alchemy, folklore, and astrology, would have understood very well the metaphors of Bosch's painting and would have followed immediately its figural progression. Filonov, however, drew on a very private and eccentric conglomeration of images; not only is there no formal structure in the Filonov, but there is also no ostensible semantic pattern. The painting is like a gigantic acrostic whose ganglia have disguised its organic core. The proximity of Filonov to Bosch suggests a much broader area of needed research, i.e., the extent to which classical Flemish and German masters influenced modern Russian art, especially St. Peters- burg artists. We hear much of the influence of Chardin and Fra- gonard on the World of Art, of the Nabis on the Blue Rose, of Gauguin and Matisse on Goncharova and Larionov, but the import of artistic ideas from Teutonic Europe of the Middle Ages and the early Refor- mnation to twentieth-century Russian art offers an unexplored but promising topic of investigation. We have only to recall masterpieces of Altdorfer, Cranach, Diirer, Gerung, and Grilnewald, some of which were well represented in St. Petersburg public and private collections, and to compare them to the work of certain St. Peters- burg artists-Filonov, Boris Grigor'ev, Masiutin-to discover a com- mon, distinctive orientation towards the expressive characteristics of line rather than mass, towards grotesquerie and an acute apprehen- sion of the darker forces of the macrocosm. It is relevant to note that the German expressionists-Beckmann, Kirchner, Meidner-also</page><page sequence="7">288 The Russian Review looked back to Altdorfer, Cranach, and GrUnewald as well as to Bosch and Breughel, of course, as their spiritual forebears. This com- mon source of inspiration and the formal similarities between, say, Filonov and Meidner allow us to explore the possibility of delineat- ing, in retrospect, the formation and development of a Russian or Russo-Baltic expressionist school, at the head of which would stand Filonov. Of course, Filonov's work cannot be fully accommodated by the term expressionist, whatever the similarities with the European movement. Filonov defies any categorical definition by virtue of his very inconsistencies and changing attitudes to art. This is manifest, for example, in his early and later treatments of line. In a picture such as Peasant Family (1910, RM) one sees the presence of a Jugendstil treatment of line, a particular emphasis on the curve as an expressive element-which one finds in the work of many St. Petersburg artists of the 1900s. This was something which Filonov would have absorbed through his acquaintance with World of Art paintings and drawings and through his attendance at the St. Petersburg Academy and the studio of Dmitriev-Kavkazsky where the standards of draftsmanship were of the highest. In his early works, therefore, very much in the Art Nouveau tradition, Filonov used line as a connective or rhythmic device, often imbuing it with a peculiar, vegetative quality. This is evident, for example, in the very disturbing drawing of two boys (1909-10, RM) (fig. 5) in which the lines of their bodies and gar- ments appear to have absorbed the chemical forces of their environ- ment, now broken and decayed. In the later Filonov, as in Heads (1924, RM) (fig. 6), line becomes less luxuriant, tending to favor a discordant, fragmentary role in place of the earlier, "melodic" one. The second vital element in Filonov's work is his transference of certain stylistic principles from pre-Christian and early Christian Slavic and Scandinavian artifacts to his basic conceptions of perspec- tive, anatomy, and composition. Filonov was profoundly interested in the stone and wooden effigies surviving from the ancient cultures of Siberia, south Russia, and Finland, and their sterness of feature, massiveness of limb, and roundness of shape inspired the lapidary, ponderous quality of many of his figures. Filonov's deliberate, infan- tile distortion of perspective and anatomical proportion, and his mag- nification of objects are methods which remind us of the parallel neo-</page><page sequence="8">Pavel Filonov: His Painting and His Theory 289 primitivist works of Goncharova, Larionov and Shevchenko and, on a different level, of Khlebnikov's primitivist poems in which he introduces "wrong" words, archaisms, and unexpected metric shifts. As in Khlebnikov's "Stone Age" poems such as I i E, nature and prim- itive life assume a decisive role in Filonov's paintings, particularly in those before 1917, although, unlike Khlebnikov's Panslavist aspir- ations, Filonov's interest in pagan Slavic culture was devoid of any nationalist chauvinism. For Filonov primitivism provided a means to pure visual perception and did not, and was not meant to, evoke nationalism. In simplistic terms, it was the form, not the content, of ancient Slavic civilization which attracted Filonov. This is evident, for example, in the two versions of The Feast of the Kings (1912 and 1913, RM), whose menacing, funereal subject causes the spectator to flee from that remote and somber world rather than seek entry. As Khlebnikov wrote: The artist had painted a feast of corpses, a feast of vengeance. Im- posing and majestic, the dead men were eating vegetables, illuminated in a frenzy of grief as if by moonlight.'2 The earlier, water-color version of The Feast (fig. 7) is an im- portant transitional work. On the one hand, it still owes a great deal to the Flemish and Germanic propensity for line, evident in the execution of the hands, and, on the other, it relies on the primitive methods of falling perspective, iconic rendition of the folds of the clothes and of the stances of at least two figures (reminiscent of Saint Nicholas), and on the traditional Scandinavian designs of the vessels and the furniture. Furthermore, the picture already seems to carry elements of "universal flowering" both in the very fullness of the composition and in the presence of the fish and flowers growing, as it were, out of the floor. In this context, one might point to Vrubel' as a possible precursor of Filonov's organic aesthetics. Vrubel's paint- ing, Bogatyr (1898, RM), for example, has these same elements of primeval vigor, massiveness and weight which we identify with the Filonov; moreover, the knight and his horse take up practically the entire surface and, like Filonov's Two Boys, seem to grow out of their surroundings. Filonov's Feast, like Vrubel's Bogatyr. could serve as 12 V. Khlebnikov, "Ka," Moskovskie Mastera, 1916, no. 1, p. 55.</page><page sequence="9">290 The Russian Review illustration to the old byliny, and it was logical that Filonov, influ- enced by both Russian and Finnish epic poetry, should have written his own poema, i.e., Propoved' o prorosli mirovoi (Song of universal flowering). Published in 1915 by Matiushin and illustrated by the artist (fig. 8), this epic chant was actually written in dramatic form and, like so many of Filonov's paintings, was ultimately incompre- hensible. Although the presence of a fair maiden, a hero, warriors, and hunters gave some idea of the general subject, the narrative progression was impeded by the liberal use of neologisms and zaum' and by the rejection of any punctuation. The result is similar to that of the paintings: here and there we detect familiar forms and images, but the chaos between them frustrates our efforts to connect them and we are left to pursue some kind of childhood, hallucinatory jour- ney through a nightmare forest of symbols which never quite cor- respond to our familiar levels of reality. This brings us to the third specific feature of Filonov's work-his conception of "universal flowering," i.e., the depiction of a subject in all its organic ramifications. Whereas Gleizes and Metzinger spoke of the work of art as something "independent . . . whole .., an organ- ism,"13 Filonov viewed it as an organism, but one dependent on a universe of matter and interacting with it at all times. It is this idea of the Weltlandschaft, the "transformation of matter into energy, the pulsation and bio-dynamics of color, form and the painting [itself],"'4 which distinguishes Filonov from artists such as Campendonk, Chag- all, and Marc, who are concerned only with isolated manifestations of botanical and zoological growth and not with the constant inter- change and interrelationship of biological processes. One of the more frequent subjects which Filonov used as a point of departure for analysis was the human head. It assumed central importance after his primitivist phase, even though it often carried primitive charac- teristics which invite comparison with African and Polynesian idols and masks and with Picasso's work of 1907-8. What exactly stim- ulated Filonov's use of the head as an artistic subject is not clear, although there can be no doubt that pre-Christian anthropomorphic statues and petrographs, early church frescoes such as those which 13 A.

The head also had symbolic significance for Filonov as the analytical and intuitional center of the universe and often appeared to be superimposed on a chaos of organic forms or to be emerging from out of them. Some- times, however, the head is almost lost in an inferno of forms and colors, as in The Head and the Thumb (1925-26, RM) where, in a very Tchelitchew-like manner, we see into its cerebral chemistry and into those bio-dynamic processes which link it with external matter. Occasionally, especially ca. 1930, Filonov intensified this develop- ment and completely submerged the head, or whatever subject, in a multitude of fantastic images. Filonov continued to produce analyt- ical paintings until his death, and even though he did make a certain compromise with the times, depicting socialist themes such as Kolkhoznik (1931, RM) (fig. 11), he was never at one with Soviet cultural policy and did not exhibit between 1934 and shortly before his death.-6 One of Filonov's most remarkable qualities was his devotion to teaching, a result of which was his elaborate pedagogical scheme for what he hoped would be a University of the Arts in Leningrad. The history of the formation and development of Filonov's school or Col- lective of Masters of Analytical Art provides the subject for a separate paper, but we may mention that many famous literati and artists- Kharms, Kibrik, Poret, Zabolotsky-studied under him at one time or another. Undoubtedly, the school's most permanent achievement was the 1933 Academy edition of the Finnish Kalevala, illustrated by some of its foremost members (fig. 12). Although he did not con- tribute directly to the edition, Filonov acted as the group's supervisor and corrector, drawing on his knowledge of other illustrations to 15 The original, sixteenth-century frescoes were overpainted in 1882. Nevertheless, Filonov would have seen photographs of them. For illustrations and details, see I. Grabar', Istorija russkogo iskusstva, 6 vols. (Moscow, 1910-14), 6: 187-96. 16 According to A. Galushkina et al., eds., Vystavki Sovetskogo izobrazitel'nogo iskusstva 2 (1967) and 3 (1973), Filonov did not contribute to any official exhibitions between July 1934 and March-April 1941 (he died on December 3, 1941) when he took part in the Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture of the Leningrad City Committee of Artists. A former pupil of his, Iuliia Arapova, in a letter to the author, August 19, 1973, maintains that Filonov did, in fact, have a one-man show in 1935 or 1936, also in Leningrad, but this has not been documented.</page><page sequence="23">292 The Russian Review Scandinavian epics by artists such as Gallen-Kallela and Josephson. Perhaps one of the most successful illustrations to the Kalevala was of the meeting between Wainamoinen and Youkahainen in the Third Rune. Executed by Tsibasov, with some assistance from Filonov, this evocative drawing transmits a "kind of human intelligence in the horses' faces, full of suffering. Not only are Youkahainen and Wain- amoinen arguing in the drawing, but the horses and nature herself are, too."'7 It was in this animation of nature or, rather, in this inter- fusion of man and the primal forces of nature that Filonov's pupils carried on the master's work. The importance of Filonov in the history of modem Russian art is unquestionable-not only because he depicted such perverse and haunting visions but also because he existed quite outside that fetish of non-representationalism with which Russian modernism has been identified so closely and so misleadingly. Like Kandinsky, Malevich, and even Larionov, Filonov regarded art as a communication of ex- perience or, rather, as a medium with which to express totally and exclusively the subjective aesthetic. Just as the surrealists hoped that the liberation of the dream element would unite mankind, so Filonov was profoundly convinced that his "&lt;analytical intuition"18 would hasten the process of social rebirth. It was a supreme irony, therefore, that his society could "in no way acknowledge [him] as the bearer of the proletarian world view"'9 and that, ultimately, he could be de- clared officially insane. At such moments of anguish, how often must Filonov have repeated the words of Aleksandr Blok: "Art is a mon- strous and brilliant hell."20 17 V.
