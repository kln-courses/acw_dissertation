<plain_text><page sequence="1">Palaephatus - Pragmatic Mythographer GEORGE F. OSMUN THERE SEEMS TO BE a tendency preva- lent at the present time to "de- bunk" our national myths and leg- ends. Newspapers and history books delight in pointing out that George Washington never cut down the cherry tree (and hence was capable of pre- varication) and that Davy Crockett's family life was less than exemplary. This way of thinking was not alien to the ancient Greeks, who not only sought to rationalize their myths and legends, but also to offer a pragmatic solution for their origin. One of the less well- known of these pragmatic mytho- graphers was Palaephatus.1 Although Palaephatus is mentioned by at least ten ancient writers, we have very little reliable information about his life. He probably lived during the fourth century and wrote about 320 B.C. or slightly later. He wrote a work en- titled Peri Apiston, On Things Incred- ible, in five books. What has come down to us is but a corrupted abridgment of the first part of the larger work. This is obvious from many considera- tions: first, because Suidas speaks of it as consisting of five books; secondly, because many ancient writers refer to Palaephatus for statements that are not found in the treatise now extant; 2 and thirdly, because the MSS. exhibit it in various forms. It contains a proemium and 52 fables with an explanation of them. Numbers 46-52 are Byzantine additions which are contained in only one group of MSS. and do not belong thematically with the preceding. The book was rarely mentioned by pagan writers, but al- ways with approval and interest (Ver- gil, Ciris 88 speaks of docta Palaepha- tia testatur voce papyrus).3 It appealed particularly to Christian writers who believed that the so-called natural ex- planations could root out pagan super- stitions. Its simple, easy style and amusing, instructive contents made it a popular reading-book in teaching the elements of the Greek language even up into the 19th century, especially in Germany and in England. Although as a writer Palaephatus is of secondary rank, he is interesting as being one of the few extant representa- tives of a particular approach to myth- ology. The treatment of this science in ancient times passed through various phases. Mythology was at first treated incidentally as being a branch of gen- ealogy, history or philosophy. The first mythological authors known to us are Xenophanes (6th century B.C.), a phi- losopher who attacked polytheism and anthropomorphism, and a Milesian, Hecataeus, who wrote toward the end of the sixth century four books of Genealogies. Theagenes of Rhegium (fl. 525 B.c.) was an allegorist who attempted to show by an examination of their names that the gods were per- sonifications of moral qualities or nat- ural elements. Also writing during the sixth century were Acousilaus, Phere- cydes and Hellanicus, all of whom were interested in myth primarily in its re- lation to the traditions of families and of cities. The second phase comprises those writers who treated mythology as a science per se. This involved an anal- ysis of the myths according to either a rationalistic or a pragmatic stand- point. Although it is difficult to trace its development, rationalism may be said to have begun with the poets who changed or altered the myths for lit- erary purposes. It was continued by the poetic philosophers, such as Ste- sichorus and Xenophanes and by the historians toward the end of the sixth century B.C. These early writers soon adopted the viewpoint that a myth does Presented at the CAMWS meeting in Lexington, 1956. 131</page><page sequence="2">132 GEORGE F. OSMUN not mean what it appears to mean. This led naturally to two interpreta- tions: the pragmatic and the allegor- ical. The latter may be subdivided further into the physical in which the gods were equated with natural elements (as in Theagenes and Metro- dorus) and the moral in which the gods were equated with moral qualities (as in Protagoras, Prodicus of Ceos, and Socrates). The allegorical method was confined, for the most part, to the phi- losophers, especially to the Stoics and to the Cynics. The pragmatic method grew out of the half-historical ap- proach as found in Herodotus and Herodorus,4 although it later gained favor with the Peripatetics. It would be most harmonious with their view that speculation must be based on ex- perience of reality and systematic research. 5 The most famous name among the pragmatic writers is that of Euhemerus who advanced the theory that the gods of mythology had their origin in kings or heroes deified by those whom they had ruled over or benefited. To this school belong Palaephatus and Hera- clitus, the latter of whom is credited with being the author of both a Peri Apiston and AllIgoriai HomCrikai. The anonymous Excerpta Vaticana belong to this genre.6 The Hellenistic Age ushered in a third treatment which had as its object not the interpretation or integration of the myths, but simply the compiling of them. Here we find handbooks on myths of various types of which Era- tosthenes' Catasterismi, giving the leg- ends of the different constellations, and Parthenius' Peri Erotik6n Pathemdton, a collection of erotic myths prepared for the use of the elegiac poet Cor- nelius Gallus, are representative. The magnum opus of this type is, of course, the BibliothekC or Library of Apollo- dorus. Other writers of these mytho- logical reference books whose works have been spared the obliteration if not the ravages of time are Conon (c. 40 B.C.) and Antoninus Liberalis (perhaps 2nd century A.D.). The Romans con- tinued the Greek passion for collecting, the most well-stocked storehouses being those of Hyginus and of Ovid. It is obviously impossible here to trace the attitude toward myth further than this. The Renaissance with its boundless enthusiasm and amazing flexibility found it perfectly possible to combine all of the treatments of the ancients and to interpret a fable literal- ly, morally, and allegorically. Mytho- logical handbooks multiplied, many of them, like Cartari's Images of the Gods, intended for the use of art- ists and sculptors. Most of them are a curious blend of Greek, Oriental, and Hebraic symbolism. The modern scholar has added the philological, an- thropological, and psychological inter- pretations and the soi-disant "scien- tific." The latter method is best illus- trated by Robert Graves in his Penguin edition of The Greek Myths where he writes: "The historical and anthropo- logical approach is the only reasonable one." Thus, we have come full circle and are back with our pragmatist Palaephatus. Perhaps the latter's explanations are somewhat more fanciful than are Graves', but the aim is similar-to re- duce the myth to its naked essence, to explain its origin, and to free the world forever from chimeras. This is a noble enterprise and it is gratifying to see modern scholars emulating their Alexandrian prototypes, but in all fair- ness it must be noted that the myths in all their beauty and mystery are still omnipresent whereas the works of Palaephatus are all but unknown. It is difficult to speak about Palae- phatus' style, since what we now pos- sess is probably an epitome of the original. In its use as a schoolbook up until the Byzantine Age the work must have undergone manifold changes. The safest method will be merely to com- ment on what we have. The 45 chapters of the preserved book reveal very little</page><page sequence="3">PALAE PHATUS 133 about the person of the author. The language is "Everyday Greek" which gives no clue to the time or school connection of the writer. In his preface Palaephatus, if it is indeed he speaking, says: "And in my travels through many countries I in- quired of old men what they had heard about each of these stories and I write here what I learned from them. And I personally visited as many countries as I could, and I have written these things down not as they were told to me, but as I myself have learned by travel and research." The purpose of the work is stated as follows: "But as for me, I think that everything which has been narrated happened. For if they were merely names, no story would have come into being about them. But first the deed occurred and then the story about it." Again I cannot resist quoting from Robert Graves (Introduction, p. 20): "Yet myths, though difficult to reconcile with chronology, are always practical: they insist on some point of tradition, however distorted the mean- ing may have become in the telling." In this prologue Palaephatus also states his principle: "For as many sights and forms as are said to have existed, which do not exist now, so many did not exist then. For if anything once existed at another time, it exists now also and will exist again." The myths analysed are all known from other sources and seldom (cf. 13) does one encounter an uncommon ver- sion. Variants are sometimes noted, but no authorities or sources are ever cited. They are short and concise. The longest contains about 500 words, the shortest 35. The average myth runs to about 16 lines or slightly over 100 words. They may have been grouped originally according to subject matter. If so, the order has been confused by the epitomist.7 The myth is presented in a few sentences without literary em- bellishment of any kind. Then comes the refutation which is frequently thrice as long as the statement of the myth. The style is repetitious to the point of monotony, although there is some at- tempt at variety. Palaephatus' pragmatic explanations of the myths may be divided somewhat arbitrarily into four categories: the log- ical explanation (8 cases), the onomas- tic (15), the etymological (4), and the metaphorical (18). Some of them, such as that of Phorcy's daughters, may contain elements of several types. The logical explanation is based pri- marily on the application of common sense to explain stories which have been exaggerated through misunder- standing or errores credulitatis. For in- stance, the Amazons were really bar- barian men, but they wore long chitons reaching to the feet like the Thracians, drew back their hair with snoods and were smooth-shaven, hence they were called "women" by their enemies. The logical explanation is frequently used to account for the metamorphoses of men and women into animals. While hunting, Atalanta and Melanion entered a cave for reasons similar to those of Dido and Aeneas. The cave was the den of a lion and lioness which were routed by the human voices. When Me- lanion's attendants saw the beasts emerge, they concluded (probably from a safe distance) that the couple had been metamorphosed. Why the story persisted after the human lovers turned up, Palaephatus fails to explain. Her- aclitus solves this problem by definitely stating that the lovers were eaten by the beasts. The story of Callisto is so short that it may be quoted entire. The story about Callisto is that while hunting she became a bear. But I say that she went into a certain thicket where there happened to be a bear which caught and ate her up. Her fellow huntsmen, see- ing her go in and not come out again, said that the girl had become a bear. This explanation calls to mind the rhyme, Algy saw a bear. The bear was bulgy; The bulge was Algy. The story of Glaucus is similar, but</page><page sequence="4">134 GEORGE F. OSMUN somewhat more credible. Glaucus was a fisherman who excelled all other men in swimming. One day he was swim- ming in the harbor and swam to a cer- tain spot beyond the sight of the peo- ple and disappeared. When he returned several days later, the villagers asked, "Where were you so many days?" and he jokingly replied, "In the sea." His fame was increased by another seem- ingly fabulous exploit. He secretly shut up fish in a reservoir and, when a storm arose which prevented the other fishermen from making a catch, he ask- ed the citizens whether they wished him to catch some fish for them. When he had caught what they wanted, the cit- izens were so filled with wonder and admiration that they henceforth called him "son of the sea." But one day while swimming he met a sea beast and lost his life and, when he did not return from the sea, the legend grew that he was living there. The last logical refutation to be men- tioned is that of Medea because it il- lustrates how cursory and superficial is Palaephatus' treatment of the myths. Medea's magical power of re- juvenating men is explained by the fact that she dyed their hair and gave them steam baths. Pelias, a feeble, old man, died of the treatment. Note that Palae- phatus carefully ignores those aspects of the myth which do not fit his ex- planation and that he passes over the many other incredible aspects of the Medea legend in silence. Under the term onomastic or appel- lative are grouped those myths which are explained by means of a name. This philological weapon is very handy for ridding the world of monsters. Scylla is merely the name of a pirate ship which Odysseus escaped by means of tribute and a favorable wind. Europa was abducted by a man named "Bull." (A dry humor is not lacking in Palae- phatus. About Europa he remarks: "But I do not think either a bull or a horse could swim so far nor a girl ride a wild bull. And if Zeus wanted Eu- ropa to come to Crete, he would have found a more pleasant means of trans- portation.") The same solution applies to the story of Pasipha6. Bellerophon's Pegasus was a swift trireme and the Chimera was a mountain whose two approaches were guarded by a lion and by a serpent respectively. Bellerophon burned out the mountain and killed the beasts. Alopex was a "Fox" only inso- far as his nature exhibited the sly cunning of this creature. Ceto was a "Sea-monster" only in the sense that Blackbeard and Jean Lafitte were. The Hydra was not a serpent with fifty heads, but the name of a town. Heracles was sent by king Eurystheus to cap- ture the town which was guarded by a tower whereon stood fifty archers. Whenever one was struck and fell, two rose up in his place. Heracles finally set fire to the tower and pillaged the town despite the efforts of Carcinus ("Crab"), a huge, warlike man who had come to Lernus' relief. Examples could be multiplied-dragons are really villains named Draco, three-headed freaks such as Geryon or Cerberus are inhabitants of a city named Trikarenia and the literal-minded, upon hearing the name, supposed that they were thus endowed. Aeolus was merely an astronomer. 8 Although the foregoing examples are really etymological in nature, this category has been reserved for those myths in which the philological ex- planation is basic to the lusis. The best example is that of the Centaurs. When Ixion was king of Thessaly the country was plagued by herds of wild cattle. Some young archers from a village called Nephele trained horses (which had previously been used only for draw- ing wagons) and riding on their backs went out and destroyed the bulls with javelins. From this event arose the tale that Ixion was the father by Nephele (Cloud) of a race of beings called Kentauroi (Bullstickers) who were a mixture of man and horse. Another example of this type is the</page><page sequence="5">PALAEPHATUS 135 story about the Sphinx. She was not a monster, but an Amazon (Palaephatus forgets that elsewhere he makes the Amazons men), the wife of Cadmus. After Cadmus killed Draco ("Drag- on"), he took Draco's sister Harmonia as his wife. Moved by jealousy Sphinx persuaded many of the citizens to join her in a revolt against Cadmus. Taking Cadmus' money and swift-footed hunt- ing dog, she hurried to a nearby moun- tain and from there declared war upon Cadmus. Also, she laid an ambush in which she seized many of Cadmus' men. Now the Thebans call an ambush a "riddle" (ainigma), so they used to say: "The savage Sphinx is destroying us, sitting on the mountain and hiding herself in a riddle. No one is able to discover the riddle and it is impossible to fight openly. For they don't run but they fly, both woman and dog." Oedipus, who was an experienced sol- dier and had a fast horse, found the riddle (i.e., the ambush) and killed Sphinx. A similar explanation is given to account for the story of the wooden horse. The "hollow" refers not to the wooden horse, but to a ravine near the city where the Greeks hid until they could enter by the breach in the walls. The apples of the Hesperides were really sheep due to a confusion about the Greek words m0lon. Heracles stole them after killing the shepherd Draco ("Dragon"). They were "golden" be- cause their wool was valuable. Hence the myth. The metaphorical refutation is per- haps the most obvious and, possibly for that reason, is most popular with Palaephatus. The story of Actaeon being eaten by his dogs is typical. This myth is the literal interpretation of the idea that Actaeon spent all his money on hunting dogs and thus was meta- phorically "eaten up" by the expense of his hounds. The same explanation holds true for Phineus. The Harpies who snatched away his food were his extravagant, wasteful daughters who reduced him to penury. Diomedes' and Glaucus' horses were man-eaters in the same sense. Niobe was not turned to stone, but her statue was set up on her children's tomb. Passersby used to say: "Stone Niobe is standing on the tomb. We saw her." So even now we often say: "I sat down near the bronze Heracles" or near "marble Hermes." Heracles was not a slave to Omphale in the literal sense; he was her slave "in love." Io did not become a cow; she "ran like a cow stung by a gadfly." Lynceus could not see beneath the earth; he was the first miner and his "eyes" were lamps. Zethus and Amphion built the walls of Thebes with a lyre. But the stones did not leap into place animistically; they were put there by men who agreed to labor on the wall for the pleasure of hearing these skilled musicians. Similarly, the trees did not follow Orpheus in dendrological procession. He was a cithara player who was hired to lead the Bacchants down from the hills. They followed him bearing in their hands their ivy-twined thyrsi and wands, so that they had the appearance of a wondrous forest ("Fear not, till Birnam wood, Do come to Dunsinane"). A few of Palaephatus' fables in their entirety will present an idea of his style or, rather, of its almost complete ab- sence. I have consciously striven in my translation to reproduce the simple, la- conic manner of the original Greek. Pandora The story that they moulded earth to give form to Pandora and to others seems to me to be insufferable. Pandora was a woman, the richest in Greece, and when she went out in public she arrayed herself splendidly and smeared herself with a lot of earth. For she first invented the fashion of smearing her skin with a lot of earth (as even now many women do, but no one is mentioned by name because the majority do it). The fact was thus. The story altered it to the impossible. If Pandora was the prototype of Eliz- abeth Arden, Daedalus was an innova- tor in the field of art.</page><page sequence="6">136 GEORGE F. OSMUN Daedalus 9 It is said about Daedalus that he set up statues of himself which walked. I per- sonally think this is impossible for a statue to walk of its own accord. The truth is this. The makers of statues and images used to fashion the hands and feet side by side as though growing together. But Daedalus first made the one foot stepping forward. For this reason men used to say, "Daedalus made this statue walk, not stand," just as even now we say "fighting men have been drawn" and we speak of "running horses" and a "tempest-tost ship," so they said he made "walking statues." The Horn of Amalthea They say that Heracles carried about every- where a horn called the horn of Amalthea from which poured forth for him whatever he desired. The truth is this. While Heracles was traveling abroad through Boeotia with his brother's son Iolaus, he lodged in Thes- piae at a certain inn where the hostess happened to be a young and very beautiful woman named Amalthea. Heracles was pleased with her and prolonged his stay. Iolaus was impatient and contrived to steal Amalthea's profits stored in a horn, from which he bought whatever he wished for himself and for Heracles. Therefore, their fellow travelers said, "Heracles has Amal- thea's horn from which he gets whatever he wishes." From this, then, the myth was exaggerated and writers who write about Heracles speak of "Amalthea's horn." Does the pragmatic method have any real value and is Palaephatus an author of such worthlessness as to justify the neglect into which his book has fallen? His a priori assumption that things which do not exist have never existed is obviously unsound and the theory that historical fact is the foundation of every fiction is nonsense. As H. J. Rose has pointed out,10 the pragmatic method appeals to a type of mind which is utterly incapable of realizing how simple people think. A woman cannot be turned into a stone or a tree, therefore stories of this sort must be the result of misunderstanding or trickery. Thus, pragmatism is valuable only insofar as legendary details are often added to historical fact. Yet, Blumenthal is somewhat too severe in his judgment that Palaepha- tus' little book because of its unspeak- ably flat rationalism is meaningful to- day only as an example of a scarcely comprehensible phase of ancient thought. The proof that this literal, pseudo-scientific type of thought ex- isted among the ancients is not with- out interest in itself. It found adher- ents and it is almost unnecessary to note that the Palaephatean method is the basis of much modern biblical ex- egesis.11 Secondly, although he applies his method too naively and exclusively, the basic procedure is not without value and has a specious attractive- ness. As Grote remarks (History of Greece, vol. 1, pp. 252 ff.): He neither credulously believes the current narratives nor does he summarily dismiss them. ... His aim is rather to show that the extra-analogical features of the stories are to be ascribed to the poets, to rumor or to misunderstanding. Accordingly, he has taken great pains to separate the true from the false. He handles the myths con- sistently and by his conjectures we get out of the impossible and arrive at matter intrinsically plausible, if uncerti- fled. Lastly, although it is perhaps im- possible for us to pass on the question, it is not beyond the realm of pos- sibility that Palaephatus was the orig- inator of the pragmatic method. We are not certain when Euhemerus' Hier&amp; Anagraph6i was published. If we accept the date 280 B.c. for the ap- pearance of this work, it is quite pos- sible that Palaephatus was the in- novator. It is just as possible that he was but one of many voices now lost in the rationalizing current of the period. Even if he is to be dated chronologically after Euhemerus, his method is basically different from that of the former. Euhemerus is concerned with the gods; there is no evidence that Palaephatus ever mentions them. It is true that scattered traces of a pragmatic approach to myth may be found in authors antedating Palaepha- tus. Although the 35 extant fragments</page><page sequence="7">137 of Hecataeus seem to be merely geo- graphical, numbers 26 and 27 embody a rationalistic explanation. Herodotus 1. 122, 2. 55-57 and 3. 18 are pragmatic in tone.12 Examples from other writers could easily be adduced. But Palaephatus is the first writer, so far as we now know, to apply the prag- matic method to a detailed study of mythology and to compile a handbook of the results. That he was imitated by later writers is probable from the works of Heraclitus who is usually dated in the first century A.D. (if, in- deed, the fragments of the Codex Vati- canus 350 are to be assigned to him) and from the Excerpta Vaticana. In the present age when pragmatism in various fields has gained such wide acceptance, Palaephatus deserves re- newed reading and careful evaluation both for his virtues and his limitations. University of Texas NOTES 1 The editions of Palaephatus I have used are Pataephati Peri Apiston, ed. Nicolaus Festa (Mythographi Graeci, vol. 3, part 2 [Leipzig, 1902]) and Palaephati Incredibilia, ed. M. Paulus Pater (Hungary, 1686). For discussions cf. Fridericus Wipprecht, Quaestiones Palaephateae, Diss. Heidelberg (Bonn, 1892) and Johannes Schrader, Palaephatea (Berlin, 1894). F. Wipprecht, Zur Entwicklung der Rationalistischen Mythendeutung bei den Griechen, Progym. Donaueschingen (Tubingen, 1902) presents an excellent study of the development of the pragmatic treatment of mythology. A summary appears in F. Susemihl, Geschichte der Griechischen Litteratur in der Alexandrinerzeit, vol. 2 (Leipzig, 1892) pp. 54-57. 2 They are collected and analysed by Wipprecht, Q. P., pp. 13 ff. 3 This citation is questionable, however. It first appears in the Aldine edition of 1517. Many edi- tors print Palaepaphiae . . . Pachynus. 4 Fr. 18 of Herodorus explains that Apollo and Poseidon did not build the walls of Troy, but that Laomedon built them with money taken from the treasuries of the temples of these gods. Wipprecht calls attention to the interesting fact that this same explanation in Eustathius (in Od. 1, p. 1382, 47 ff.) is ascribed to Palaephatus and is found related in almost the same words in Excerpta Vaticana 4 (Festa, p. 89). 5 Schrader points out that Palaephatus' in- terest in natural history, inventions, and ancient customs was also shared by the Peripatetics. 6 The 39 brief fables attributed to Heraclitus and the 23 anonymous Excerpta Vaticana are in- cluded in Festa's edition of Palaephatus. This slim volume comprises all that remains of the pragmatic mythographers. 7 Schrader, pp. 15-17 endeavors to reconstruct the original order. 8 Cf. Eur. Helen 489 ff. where Menelaus suggests that there may be a man named Zeus living in Egypt. 9 Cf. Plato, Euth. 11 C. 1o H. J. Rose, A Handbook of Greek Mythology (New York, 1928) p. 4. 11 For an example of a contemporary applica- tion of the Palaephatean method, cf. L. G. Pocock's explanation of Scylla in The Landfalls of Odysseus (Christchurch, 1955) p. 12. 12 Wipprecht, E. R. M., pp. 20-38 argues that Hecataeus, like Pherecydes and Acousilaus, uses the historical method rather than the pragmatic, and that Herodotus so divorces the stories from the miraculous that they can no longer be classi- fied as myths. Herodotus has almost discarded the Volksglaube and accepted the Euhemeristic concept of the heroes as mortals.</page></plain_text>
