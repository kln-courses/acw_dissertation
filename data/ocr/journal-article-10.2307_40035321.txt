<plain_text><page sequence="1">GENDER IN MIDDLE RANGE SOCIETIES: A CASE STUDY IN CASAS GRANDES ICONOGRAPHY Christine S. VanPool and Todd L. VanPool Gender analyses have provided useful insights into the social organization of the people anthropologists study. Here we demonstrate how Casas Grandes gender roles influenced other aspects ofCasas Grandes worldview and social life. Medio period (A.D. 1200-1450) iconography depicts differences between males and females. Gender roles were not only defined by their proximity to males and females but to birds and serpents. Furthermore, Casas Grandes cosmology was based on gender complementarity that combined the productive, reproductive, and ritual activities of men and women within a sin- gle system. The development of social differentiation was tied to this system, indicating that gender complementarity and the accumulation of productive and ritual power into a limited group of women and men may have been an important fac- tor in the development of social hierarchies in many Middle Range societies. Durante elperiodo Medio (1200-1450 D.C.), la iconografia de la cultura Casas Grandes incluyo una distincion entre lo mas- culino y lafemenina. Los papeles sexuales fueron definidos no solamente con imdgenes de hombres y mujeres sino tambien con imdgenes de pdjaros y serpientes. Las imdgenes indican una cosmologia que incluyo papeles complementarios para los sexos. La produccion, la reproduccion, y las actividades rituales de ambos sexos se combinaron en una sola sistema intelec- tual. Ambos sexos participaron en los rituales, los hombres sirviendo como shamanes y las mujeres vigildndoles. years ago Margaret Conkey and Janet Spector (1984) challenged archaeologists to explicitly include studies of gender in their efforts to understand the past. Even then, Con- key and Spector (1984:24-27) argued that gender studies should entail more than merely determin- ing the activities performed by members of each sex. A gendered prehistory should also include determinations of how gender roles and the asso- ciated ideology structured other aspects of social life and ritual (Brumfiel 1996:143; Conkey and Gero 1991; Crown 2000). Since their seminal arti- cle, gender has become a significant research domain and has provided invaluable insights into the structure of many cultures. Recent work in the North American Southwest illustrates the important insight into social organi- zation, ideology, and ritual activities that gender research can produce (papers in Crown 2000; Crown and Fish 1996; Crown and Wills 1995; Hays-Gilpin and Hill 1999; Mills 1995; Mobley- Tanaka 1997; Munson 2000; Rautman 1997). Miss- ing from Southwestern studies, however, is a detailed consideration of gender in the Casas Grandes region of northern Chihuahua, southern New Mexico, and southeastern Arizona, an area that arguably reached the greatest level of political complexity and social differentiation in the pre- historic Southwest (Di Peso et al. 1974; Harmon 2005; VanPool and Leonard 2002; Whalen and Minnis 2003:314). Yet an examination of gender in the region will provide insight into the forma- tion of social differentiation and the role that gen- der plays in organizing Middle Range societies. In this paper, which is a companion piece with VanPool (2003a), we argue that Medio period (A.D. 1 200-1450) Chihuahuan polychrome human effigy vessels reflect gender distinctions in the Casas Grandes region. We identify differences in posture, body decoration, and associated iconography between men and women, and tie these differences to the larger social structure. We conclude that Casas Grandes gender relations were based on gen- der complementarity, with males and females hav- Christine S. VanPool and Todd L.

This pattern is similar to that noted for Mesoamerican societies and some Puebloan groups in the Southwest, but is different from the model of dual gender hierarchies commonly applied to prehistoric Southwestern groups (see Crown and Fish 1996). This finding suggests that gender distinctions, while important, were sec- ondary to class distinctions and other social factors in the Casas Grandes region. Sex, Gender, and the Construction of Social Life Gender is one of the primary principles in the devel- opment of personal identity and is also a major structuring principle in social life (Brumfiel 1996:143; Conkey and Gero 1991; Costin 1996:112). All primates socially differentiate between males and females. In humans, this social differentiation results in gender differences between men and women. People generally asso- ciate their biological sex with the corresponding gender category of their culture. However, many groups have third and even fourth gender categories in addition to "men" and "women" (Roscoe 1991, 1998). Scholars distinguish between biological sex and gender: sex is a biological fact that is defined by one's genes and is reflected by one's genitalia and secondary sexual characteristics, whereas gen- der is a cultural construct generally but not exclu- sively correlated with biological differences. Gender can be arbitrary and does not always cor- respond perfectly with one's sex (Crown 2000: 14; Errington 1990; Smith 1992). In fact, third and forth gender categories often reflect individuals whose gender and sex do not correspond as is typ- ical for most people within a culture, or hermaph- rodites and other intersexed individuals who are sexually ambiguous (Dreger 2000). We conse- quently use the terms "sex" when discussing bio- logical females and males, and "gender" when discussing women and men as cultural construc- tions. Gender constructs dictate physical appearance (e.g., hair style, clothes, and adornments), the activ- ities in which one can participate (e.g., grinding corn or smoking), modes of interactions (e.g., the people with which one can interact and the struc- ture of the interaction), and reactions to the social world (e.g., crying or violence) (Costin 1996: 1 12). Gender is consequently an easily recognized attribute of an individual's social identity and is sig- naled by one's physical stance, speech, dress, jew- elry, symbols, and the activities that one performs (Errington 1990; Lorber 1994; Munson 2000: 128). Because they are so pervasive within a society and are reflected in many aspects of a person's behav- ior, archaeologists can often gain considerable insight into gender constructions. Gender constructs are often fluid and change with age, however. A young child may be "gen- derless" and may not need to conform to the appro- priate manners in dress or activities applicable to older children and adults for example (Crown 2000a: 14-16). Likewise, a middle-aged or post- menopausal woman may be free to engage in activ- ities typically conducted by males, such as curing (Crown 2000a: 16-17). The flexibility of gender roles is also indicated by atypical genders such as a third or fourth gen- ders. Throughout North America many groups had a "culturally appropriate" third gender for non- masculine males, i.e., for males who were not "men," and a fourth gender for nonfeminine females, i.e., for females who were not "women" (Lang 1998; Roscoe 1991, 1998). These third and fourth gender roles do not necessarily reflect homo- sexuality and are more than simply constructs for cross-dressing males and females. Rather, these genders represent categories of social interaction that are distinct from the categories of men and women (Hill 1998: 101). Often these additional gen- ders emphasize both the masculine and feminine, thereby creating a "mixed" or "compromised" gen- der. For example, Kolhaman, a Zuni katchina, has both male and female hair styles with one half of the hair pulled up and the other half let down (Roscoe 1991: Figure 26). Archaeologists should therefore treat gender as a fluid social construct, instead of as an absolute dichotomy based on bio- logical sex (Meskell 1996). Gender Construction in the American Southwest As previously mentioned, gender research in the U.S. Southwest has provided important insights. Most research indicate "that there were gross sim- ilarities in the sexual division of labor. . . . More-</page><page sequence="3">VanPool and VanPool] GENDER IN MIDDLE RANGE SOCIETIES 55 over, the patterns seen in the Southwest roughly match patterns found worldwide and cross cultur- ally" (Crown 2000a:28). Men hunted with bows and arrows, conducted warfare, and participated in various rituals. Women gathered wild plants, processed and prepared food, took care of children, and engaged in some rituals (Crown 2000a: 28, 2000b; Crown and Fish 1996; Crown and Wills 1995; Fish 2000; Hays-Gilpin and Hill 1999; Mills 1995; Mobley-Tanaka 1997; Munson 2000; Raut- man 1997; Shaffer et al. 1997; Shaffer et al. 1999; Spielmann 2000; Szuter 2000). However, women also did some hunting, farming, and carrying of bur- dens (Crown 2000a:31; Munson 2000; Shaffer et al. 1999; Szuter 2000). Based on gender symbolism and other evidence, two basic models for gender power, prestige, and ritual have been used to characterize gender rela- tions in the Southwest. The most common model, gender parallel hierarchy, stipulates that dual hier- archies reflected by gender division of labor, grave goods, and food developed as men and women increasingly conducted different activities often in different spaces (Crown 2000a; Crown and Fish 1996; Mitchell 1991, 1994; Neitzel 2000; Spiel- mann 2000; Whittlesey 1984:283). For example, Crown and Fish (1996) argue that women in the Hohokam region prepared and served food, whereas men participated in specialized rituals. This differentiation resulted in the development of different status hierarchies for each gender that were based on differing criteria. Ritual distinctions between men and women further helped encour- age this differentiation. Crown (2000a: 36-37) agues that this model is in accord with what is known ethnographically for Southwestern soci- eties. The second model, gender complementarity, has received less attention from researchers in both the U.S. Southwest and Mesoamerica (Joyce 1996:180). This model stipulates that men and women have comparable social power and prestige, and that they conduct interdependent productive and ritual activities (Hays-Gilpin 2000:92; Joyce 1996:180; Schlegel 1977:260). For many groups, including the Hopi, the Tewa at San Juan Pueblo, Andean groups, and the Tzotzil Maya, the cosmos could not exist in harmony if both men and women did not work together to complete all aspects of life including ceremonies and daily chores (Devereax 1987; Harris 1978; Jacob 1995; Joyce 1996:180-182; Loftin 1991; Schlegel 1977; Wood 1977). For example among the Hopi people, women's role in grinding and producing "the sacred cornmeal" - the symbol of natural and spiritual life - is crucial in all ceremonies as well as life in general (Schlegel 1977:260). Both men and women give cornmeal as prayers (Loftin 1991), and women's ceremonies are considered to be sibling ceremonies to the men's ceremonies that are nec- essary for the proper maintenance of the world. Thus, instead of having separate hierarchical struc- tures, men and women participated in the same hierarchical system, albeit in different roles. Joyce (1996:180) argues that gender comple- mentarity was important in wider Native American beliefs. Likewise, Hays-Gilpin (2000:93) contends that "gender complementarity has great time depth in the Pueblo and Mimbres areas." While one can never absolutely confirm or refute a model, we argue that Medio period Casas Grandes imagery indicates that gender complementarity models bet- ter approximate the Casas Grandes social system than dual hierarchy models, as may also be true for many groups throughout the Americas including the people in the Anasazi and Mimbres regions (Hays-Gilpin 2000). The Casas Grandes Region The Medio period (A.D. 1200-1450) Casas Grandes archaeological culture encompassed northern Mexico, southeastern Arizona, southern New Mexico, and westernmost Texas (Figure 1; LeBlanc 1986:116-118; Ravesloot 1988; Schaaf- sma and Riley 1999:5-8). Outlines of the region's prehistory have been presented elsewhere (Phillips 1989; Whalen and Minnis 2001), but to briefly summarize, it is characterized by the formation of large communities such as Paquime (formerly called Casas Grandes). Paquime was both the largest Casas Grandes site, measuring 1 km in diameter, and the site with the most apparent ritual architecture, which included two large I-shaped ball courts, a T-shaped ball court, numerous plat- form mounds, and a wide range of ritual rooms with ritual artifacts (Brown 1998; Di Peso 1974; Fish and Fish 1999:40; Lekson 1999:15; Narez 1991; Phillips 1989:382; Walker 2002; Wilcox 1995; Whalen and Minnis 2003). Paquime was the</page><page sequence="4">56 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 71 , No. 1 , 2006 Figure 1. Map of the Casas Grandes Region. "heart" of the Casas Grandes culture (Phillips 1989:383) and was a "Ceremonial City" (Lekson 1999:15; see also Braniff 1999; Schaafsma 2000; Walker 2002). Fish and Fish (1999:40) have pro- posed that Paquime may have been the "destina- tion of regional pilgrimages, serving to ideologically reinforce and unite outlying popula- tions" (Schaafsma 2000). The significant invest- ment of labor in the construction of monumental architecture that includes 18 platform mounds and specially shaped rooms indicates a community- wide emphasis on ritual activity (Fish and Fish 1999; Lekson 1999; Schaafsma 2000). Imagery often reflects aspects of a group's beliefs. Although prehistoric imagery sometimes presents an idealized notion of the world (Hays- Gilpin 2000:91), several studies of Casas Grandes vessels indicate that they provide realistic repre- sentations of humans and animals and reflect sig- nificant symbolism, themes, and ritual activities (Braniff 1999; Narez 1991:20; Sprehn 2001; Van- Pool 2001 , 2003b; VanPool and VanPool 2002). As a result, social norms related to gender are likely to be reflected by the effigies and painted humans. Gender Construction on Casas Grandes Polychromes The naturalistic paradigm (Thompson 1999:39-54) provides a useful starting place to begin the inter- pretive analysis of Casas Grandes human effigies. This approach is appropriate because the effigy vessels appear to accurately depict human form and behavior, the latter including smoking pipes and nursing infants. For example, at least 22 effi- gies show males smoking cylinder pipes that are morphologically similar to stone pipes found at Paquime (VanPool 2003a). The similarity between the depicted and actual pipes indicates that actual behavior is represented in the pottery with a sig- nificant degree of accuracy. The variation in facial decoration, activities, dress, and general body mor- phology/position likewise indicates that the effigies represent separate individuals, and probably real</page><page sequence="5">VanPool and VanPool] GENDER IN MIDDLE RANGE SOCIETIES 57 Figure 2.

An obvious distinction in human effigies is male and female forms. Sex is indicated by the presence of primary and secondary sexual characteristics such as penises, vulvas, and breasts. These attrib- utes are often enlarged or otherwise accentuated so as to remove any ambiguity about the individual's sex (Figures 2 and 3). We have examined only fully Figure 3.

( 1 974) and Narez ( 1 99 1 ; Tables 2 and 3). Both female and male effigies have a great deal of variation in facial markings and body decora- tions, which frequently crosscut sex. For example, leggings with squiggly lines and cheeks decorated with step designs are found on both the sexes. How- ever, there are marked differences between males and females in their postures, body sizes, and body decorations (Sprehn 2001; VanPool and VanPool</page><page sequence="8">60 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 71 , No. 1 , 2006 Table 4.

These associations strongly correlate with biological sex, indicating that they reflect gender differences. These differ- ences are summarized in Table 4 and will be fur- ther discussed below. These in turn will allow insight into the organization of gender relations in the Casas Grandes region. Differences in Posture As noted by Woosley (200 1 : 1 74), perhaps the most striking difference between males and females is their posture. Males have one or both legs drawn to their bodies, whereas females' legs are extended. Not all effigies are complete (in some cases the legs are missing, making body posture impossible to determine), but in our sample, 49 of 50 male fig- ures have one or both of their legs flexed to their chest, or are sitting with both of their legs flexed beneath them (Figure 2; the remaining male has one leg extended and bent in front of him2). In contrast, 34 of the 40 females' legs are extended in front of their bodies (Figure 3). Two female effigies are lying on their sides, a variant called the "reclining female" (Di Peso 1977) that has not been reported for male effigies. Only one of the female effigies has her legs pulled to her chest in the same posi- tion as most of the males. (The leg positions of the remaining three female effigies could not be deter- mined.) A Chi-square analysis of the frequencies demonstrates the difference in posture by sex is nonrandom (Table 5). The resulting Chi-square value is 76.1, which exceeds the critical value of 6.0 for two degrees of freedom and an alpha level of .05. Analysis of the Chi-square adjusted residu- als (Table 5) demonstrates that there are more males with one or both of their legs drawn to their body and more females with their legs extended than would be expected by chance alone.3 These differ- ences indicate that the Medio period artisans con- sciously depicted the males and females in very different body positions; women sat with their legs extended and males sat with their legs flexed to the body. Given the strong uniformity in position, this may have mirrored the actual seating patterns of Casas Grandes men and women (see Errington 1990, Lorber 1994 for gender reflected through physical stance).4 Differences in Symbols Body decorations of male and female effigy ves- Table 5.

Human effigies are commonly depicted with a vari- ety of facial decorations including step, arrow, and line motifs on the cheek, ticking and triangles on the chin, eye decorations that resemble the frames of glasses, ticking on the ear, and "weeping eyes" that consist of a scroll extending down from the cor- ner of the eye onto the cheek. Females and males are both depicted with facial decorations, but there are differences in the frequencies of those decora- tions (Table 6). In particular, females are more often depicted with steps and arrows on their checks and chin ticking than males (Sprehn 2001). In contrast, males are more frequently decorated with "eye glasses" and triangles on their chins than females. To determine if there are additional differences in facial decorations associated with males and females in our sample, a Fisher's Exact Probabil- ity was calculated.5 The resulting Fisher's exact probability is .002, which is smaller than the alpha level of .05. We therefore conclude the differences between the facial decoration of the males and females are statistically significant. An Analysis of Adjusted Residuals of a Chi- square Test of the same data (Table 8) indicates that females are likely to have cheek steps and cheek lines, whereas males are more likely to have chin triangles and eyeglass- like designs. The bodies of male and female effigies are also decorated with different symbols. The pound sign is common on males (see VanPool 2003 a: Color Plate 1), but rare on females. In our sample, 10 males and only one female are decorated with the pound sign. A similar but distinct design (Figure 4), which Ken Kokrda (personal communication 2001) calls the modified pound sign, is common on females, but not on males; eight of the females and none of the males have this design. A Fisher's Exact Probability test was used to determine if differences in the frequency of the designs are statistically significant. The resulting probability is .0002, which is smaller than the alpha of .05. We therefore conclude that the association of the modified pound sign with females and the pound sign with males is statistically significant. Males and females are also associated with icons (naturalistic depictions) and motifs (abstract or geo- metric depictions) of various animals including horned serpents (Figure 2), a macaw design we've dubbed the "Double-Headed Macaw Diamond" motif (DD) (Figure 5), and an indeterminate bird (Figure 3). Two males and five females are associ- ated with the indeterminate bird, two females and no males are associated with the DD motif, and 1 1 males and only five females are associated with horned serpent icons and motifs. Both Munson (2000:139-140) and Thompson (1999:134-136) illustrate that macaws are associated with females in Mimbres iconography, a pattern that intuitively seems to hold with Casas Grandes iconography. In contrast, horned serpent iconography seems to be more common on males.</page><page sequence="10">62 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 71 , No. 1 , 2006 Table 8.

Females and males, however, also have pro- found similarities in their body decorations. Both males and females are depicted with diamonds with ticking, and running bands with circles with a cen- tral dot. These running bands of circles take the form of sashes and leggings that are found on the effigies' legs and arms (Figure 3; Table 7). Differences in Activities Males and females are depicted engaging in dif- ferent activities (Table 9). These differences are often related to their sex. For example, an effigy portrays a female perhaps giving birth and Figure 6 depicts a female nursing an infant. In contrast, three males in our sample are depicted holding their penises or masturbating (Figure 7). However, many of the differences are not clearly related to the phys- iology of the sexes. Five females are depicted hold- ing bowls (e.g., Figure 8), and 22 of the males are depicted smoking (e.g., Figures 2 and 7). On two pots, masturbating males are also smoking (e.g., Figure 7). In our sample, females are not illustrated smoking and males are not represented holding bowls. Because these activities are commonly depicted but do not crosscut the sexes, they likely reflect differences in male and female behaviors and roles. Differences in Proportions One final difference is the physical proportions of male and female effigy pots. Intuitively, female fig- ures tend to be more rotund, with flaring hips and stomach and narrower shoulders, giving them a somewhat pear-shaped appearance compared to male effigies, which tend to be more straight-bodied (e.g., compare Figures 3, 5, and 6 with Figures 2 and 7). This trend seems to hold across our sample and may indicate that the Medio period artisans Figure 6. Female effigy jar nursing. Courtesy of Arizona State Museum (Catalogue No. GP 3742).

Photograph by Art MacWilliams. consciously sought to depict males and females with different body proportions (see also Woosley 2001:174). Some of the bellies of female effigies also protrude, possibly reflecting pregnancy (Woosley 2001:174). To statistically evaluate the possibility that males and females are systematically depicted differently, we compared the effigies' breadth at the shoulders with the breadth at the hips by creating a ratio between the maximum distance across the shoul- ders and the across the hips (Figure 9). A ratio of 1 represents a straight-bodied effigy whose shoul- ders and hips are the same size. A ratio greater than 1 represents a "broad-shouldered" individual. A ratio less than 1 represents an individual with big hips. Because of the vagaries of the design of indi- vidual effigies and the use of published images, which were taken at various angles, it was impos- sible to obtain measurements for all of the effigies. Whenever possible, we recorded the measurements across the front of the effigy and the profile of the effigy. We were able to record the shoulder-to-hip ratio of 21 males and 19 females from the front per- spective and the profile ratios of 17 males and 17 females (Table 10). Although both front and side ratios were taken for two effigies of females and three effigies of males, our images of the remain- ing effigies allowed the measurement from only one of the perspectives. As a result, the samples from each perspective are largely independent, and there- fore represent two different samples of effigies that can be used to evaluate the hypothesis concerning the proportions of males and females. Summary statistics of the ratios are presented in Table 10. The average ratio of female effigies measured from the front and the profile are roughly identical (.82 and .76 respectively). Likewise, the average ratio of male effigies measured from the front and the profile are similar (.92 and .97 respec- tively). As is evident from the average ratios, how- ever, female effigies tend to have larger hips than their male counterparts. Still, the maximum and minimum ratios illustrate that there is considerable variation within the distributions. To evaluate whether the differences between the average ratios of males and females are statistically significant, we performed two t-Tests, one to compare the aver- age ratios from the front view and the other to com- pare the average ratios from the side view (i.e., the profile). The result of the t-Test for the frontal views is 3.973, which exceed the critical value of 2.024 for 38 degrees of freedom (alpha = .05).

The results of both t-Tests therefore exceed the critical values; we conclude that the hips and bellies of the female effigies protrude more than their male coun- terparts do. This difference certainly reflects a design choice on the part of the Medio period pot- ters. A Summary of Gender Differences Reflected in Casas Grandes Effigies Differences in body positions, body proportions, activities, and facial decorations between males and females indicate that gender does map onto the sexes and that these differences were used to define the genders. The "masculine gender" is defined as males sitting with their legs flexed to their bodies, decorated with pound signs and horned serpent imagery, smoking, holding their penis, and, to a lesser degree, decorated with eyeglass-like designs and triangles on their chins. The "feminine gender" is defined as females with larger midsections sit- ting with their legs extended, decorated with mod- ified pound signs and bird imagery, holding children and pots, and occasionally nursing. Females are also more likely to be decorated with steps, arrows, and lines on their cheeks than males. Third and fourth genders may also be reflected in the effigies. As previously discussed, Roscoe (1998) reports that third and fourth genders often incorporate mixtures of traits. A "nonmasculine" male gender is perhaps represented by a male effigy</page><page sequence="14">66 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 71 , No. 1 , 2006 vessel (Narez 1991:214) that has one leg extend, which is atypical for men. (Unfortunately the other leg is broken at the body, preventing us from deter- mining whether this male had the typical female posture.) Although the leg is away from the body, it is somewhat bent, not completely straight as is characteristic of females. The atypical male is also pear shaped, which is indicative of females. A "non-feminine female gender" may also be represented by two female effigies. The first is a female who has three pound signs on her lower stomach above the vulva (ASM CG/3442-26). Except for this individual, pound signs are limited to males, who typically have them on their legs and stomachs. Perhaps this structural difference with the use of a male symbol represented another gen- der. The proximity of the pound signs to the effigy's vulva is also consistent with the possibility that the pound signs are associated with an unborn child that the female carries. (Of all of the female effigy ves- sels, this vessel is the most suggestive of a pregnant female, with a pronounced stomach, a very enlarged vulva, and accentuated buttocks.) Another female effigy vessel (MAI 4/7234) has the posture typical of males, with its legs drawn to its chest. Other than its posture, it has the traits associated with women including DD macaw designs. This vessel could reflect the combination of gender specific traits and the presence of an additional gender. Themes that crosscut gender categories can also be identified from this analysis. Both males and females are depicted with step motifs, arrows, and parallel lines on their cheeks, and ticking on their chins and ears. Both sexes have similar body sym- bols that consist of isolated diamonds with ticking (which may be symbols for textiles) and running bands with circles with a central dot (sashes and leggings) (see Figure 10). Based on the fact that this particular running band is frequently used as decorations on serpent bodies (VanPool 2003 a), we suspect that these sashes and legging are sym- bols for serpents that humans wear, i.e., sashes and leggings made of snakeskin. It is unclear what these symbols may represent, although they may be class, clan, or sodality markers. Other Human Icons Some of the gender markers identified on the effigy vessels are also evident oh other human figures. Occasionally human figures are found either Figure 10. Male effigy with a running banding of circles. Courtesy of the El Paso Centennial Museum, University of Texas, El Paso (Catalogue No. A 36.2.23). painted on a jar (n = 14) or more rarely are appliqued on a vessel (n = 3). Painted humans usu- ally occur in pairs, one on each side of a vessel. Only seven vessels in our sample of over 2,000 non- effigy pots have human icons. None of the painted figures are depicted with primary or secondary sex- ual characteristics, although a vessel at Centennial Museum has an appliqued female and male on opposite sides of the vessel. Both are standing upright (Figure 11). Painted human figures are often depicted with horned serpent and macaw headdresses, kilts, small circles with dots, diamonds with ticking, or pound signs (Figure 12). As was previously discussed, male effigies are associated with pound signs and females are associated with modified pound signs. Most of the painted individuals are associated with the pound sign, indicating that they are associated with male imagery and therefore are most likely males. To confirm this association, a Chi-square analysis was conducted (Table 11). The resulting Chi-square value is 82.9, which exceeds the criti- cal value of 6.0 for 2 degrees of freedom (alpha = .05). The null hypothesis is rejected and an exam- ination of the adjusted residuals confirms that males are more likely associated with pound signs and females with modified pound signs (as was estab- lished previously). However, the painted individu- als are even more likely to be associated with pound signs than male effigies. At least two possibilities can explain this asso- ciation. The first is that pound signs are male gen- der markers that are unnecessary when male genitalia is depicted, but are used in images such</page><page sequence="15">VanPool and VanPool] GENDER IN MIDDLE RANGE SOCIETIES 67 Figure 11. Appliqued human figures on vessel. Courtesy of El Paso Centennial Museum, University of Texas, El Paso (Catalogue No A 36.1.130). as the painted individuals that lack genitalia to remove ambiguity about the individual's sex. This is consistent with the use of symbols, clothing, and posture rather than genitalia to denote gen- der elsewhere in the Southwest (Crown 2000a:40). A second possibility that we argue is more likely is that the pound signs are associated with a spe- cific subset of males. If so, these males are dispro- portionately represented as painted individuals. Figure 12. Human figure with pound signs and horned/plumed serpent headdress. Courtesy of El Paso Centennial Museum, University of Texas, El Paso (Catalogue No. A 36.85.18). Christine VanPool (2002, 2003a) has previously argued that this subset of males (especially the male smoker effigies) is also frequently signified by tri- angles painted on their chins and depicted partici- pating in shamanic ritual. If so, then the individuals painted on vessels are likely shamans as well (see also VanPool 2003a). The strength of the association between smoker effigies, the pound sign, and chin triangles is demonstrated by their co-occurrence. Six smokers (27 percent of the 22 smoker effigies) have chin tri- angles; five of the six (83 percent) also have pound signs. In contrast, none of the women have chin tri- angles and only three of the nonsmoking male effi- gies ( 1 1 percent of the 2 8 nonsmoker male effigies) have chin triangles. Two of these nonsmoker male effigies also have pound signs, further demon- strating the association between chin triangles and the pound sign, and possibly suggesting that these individuals represent shamans. Only one male who is not smoking and/or does not have a chin trian- gle has pound signs. Table 11.

Shaman in flight with a tutelary bird. Drawn from Di Peso (1974:534, Figure 302-2). Interpretation Casas Grandes effigies and painted pots reflect sex specific body proportions, posture, symbolism, and activities (summarized in Table 4), demonstrating that gender construction was primarily mapped onto biological differences between males and females. In a few cases there were mixed traits sug- gesting that there may have been additional gen- ders. Casas Grandes artisans depicted a wide range of behaviors and beliefs from rules about social behavior (sitting positions) to ritual activities (smoking) and the supernatural (horned/plumed serpents). The images reflect idealized representa- tions of how men and women should behave, the activities in which they participated, and their role within the cosmological system. VanPool (2002, 2003a) argues that smokers and painted individuals decorated with the pound sign are shamans smoking hallucinogenic substances including tobacco (Figure 2), participating in phys- ically punishing activities such as dancing (Figure 12), and perhaps fasting and self-mutilation to induce trance. Once in trance, the shamans meta- physically transformed into spirit beings, who trav- eled to the spirit world (Figure 13), and interacted with cosmological entities (Figure 14) to gain infor- mation and self-empowerment, to intercede on another person's behalf, or to help ensure the avail- ability of resources such as water. The males then returned to the physical world, again becoming physical beings as they emerged from their trance. This journey, which is illustrated in Figure 5 from VanPool (2003a:706), reflects the classic shamanic journey, a robust cross-cultural pattern observed by ethnologists worldwide among simple and middle- range societies (e.g., Dobkin de Rios 1976; Eliade 1964; Lewis-Williams and Dowson 1988; Myer- hoff 1976:102-103; Narby and Huxley 2001; Sharon 1993:166; VanPool 2003a; Whitley 1994, 2000; Wilbert 1987). The fact that all of the smok- ers without exception are males indicates that the shamans undertaking the journey are primarily male. However, the one female effigy vessel with pound signs may indicate that an occasional woman was a shaman too or perhaps a shaman's helper. Also of significance is the prominent role that the indeterminate bird and the Double-Headed Macaw Diamond play in the shamanic journey. These images, which are statistically associated with females, are illustrated as integrated compo- nents of the shamanic transformation; the indeter- minate bird is depicted on the leg of the transformed shaman as he travels to the spirit world (Figure 1 3), and as one of the three cosmologically significant entities with which the transformed shaman inter- acts (Figure 14). The association of the bird with the transformed shaman suggests that the bird is a significant con- tributor to this journey. Ethnologists have noted that liminal states during which an individual undergoes a transition from one socially defined state to another (e.g., girl to woman, life to death) are frequently viewed as dangerous times that require extensive ritual to help the individual's transformation be safely completed (e.g., puberty rites, mortuary rites; Turner 1969). The shamanic transformation from physical to spirit being is often viewed as a particularly dangerous transformation, because it involves the shaman's spirit leaving his body and traveling elsewhere (Myerhoff 1976; Sharon 1993; Whitley 2000; Wilbert 1987). This transformation is made even more dangerous because of the physical stress placed on the shaman as a result of extended fasting, drug use, and self- mutilation that frequently accompany the initiation of the trance. Additional rituals are therefore frequently used in many societies after the shaman has entered the trance to protect both his spirit and body (Myerhoff 1976; Sharon 1993; Turner 1969; Wilbert 1987). These rituals often involve the use of "tutelary ani-</page><page sequence="17">VanPool and VanPool] GENDER IN MIDDLE RANGE SOCIETIES 69 Figure 14. Casas Grandes supernatural realm. Drawn from photograph courtesy of Justin Kerr, No. K1548. mals," that is, spirit animals that are sent along with the shaman to help guide him to and from the spirit world safely (Myerhoff 1976; Sharon 1993; Turner 1969; Wilbert 1987). These rituals also frequently involve individuals, sometimes the shaman's wife or sister (e.g., Thevet 2001 [1557]), conducting rit- uals and caring for his body, which is often rigid and lacking a detectable pulse when tobacco is used (Wilbert 1987:157-158). We argue that the Casas Grandes effigies reflect such a pattern of female tutelage. To wit, the pres- ence of the indeterminate bird during the shamanic journey suggests it is a tutelary animal that helps the shaman navigate between the spirit and physi- cal worlds (VanPool 2003a:706). The fact that this bird is associated with females suggests that females hold a special place in watching over the shaman's spirit, and very likely his physical body, during his journey. This transformation would have been likely dangerous for the female helpers too, and they would have engaged in rituals associated with their male counterparts, especially given that their roles as guardians were central to the suc- cessful completion of the shamanic journey. Thus, the prominent role of the bird likely represents the participation of females as guardians and caregivers in the shamanic ritual. The association of horned serpents with males and Double-Headed Macaw Diamonds with females also suggests that the cosmological view of the world is based on a combined gendered per- spective. The figures are associated with different genders, but are both represented as cosmologi- cally significant entities with which the male shamans interact in the cosmological realm (Fig- ure 14). Furthermore, the transformed shaman has both male and female traits. He has the pound sign that is found on males but he also has a macaw head (a female trait). Joyce (1996:183) discussed the "two-spirit phe- nomenon" in which a single individual takes both male and female gender traits as a common part of symbolism associated with gender complementar- ity throughout North America. This interpretation is particularly appropriate for Casas Grandes sym- bolism, which is based on the merging of dualities such as birds and snakes, red and black, and, most likely, life and death (VanPool and VanPool 2002). For example, the very union of bird traits and ser- pent traits into the single creature of the plumed/horned serpent illustrates that birds and serpents are not necessarily in opposition but rather are joined in the primordial state, making a com- plete creature that balances aspects of the sky and the underworld (see VanPool 2003b).6 Females and males are likewise reflections of different aspects of a unified cosmological structure based on a bal- ance between the feminine and the masculine. The transformed shaman illustrates such a "two-spirit" individual, who is both male and female. The association of females with the DD motif and males with horned serpents on effigy vessels suggest that in the mundane world women and men are part of the broader cosmological realm, just like birds and snakes reflect aspects of horned/plumed serpents. This suggests that Casas Grandes society was based on gender comple- mentarity, which has been reported in the Ameri- can Southwest and Mesoamerica (Hays-Gilpin 2000; Joyce 1996). Such a system is most common when both women and men are engaged in high- prestige activities and craft production (Joyce 1996:187). The differential activities that are por- trayed on Casas Grandes effigies can provide infor- mation about how the genders worked together to fulfill different needs of society. Men smoked and took part in dangerous yet socially significant rit- uals. Women participated in rituals and likely took</page><page sequence="18">70 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 71 , No. 1 , 2006 care of male shamans during their trances. Women raised children and perhaps macaws, which were important in rituals and for ritual paraphernalia (Di Peso 1974; VanPool 2001). They also were por- trayed holding bowls, indicating that they may have been responsible for serving food, perhaps during feasts and/or ceremonies. Joyce (1996:185-186) describes the ritual cargo system of the contem- porary Maya, in which married men and their wives perform gender specific ritual duties for the com- munity, including women preparing and serving communal meals. A similar system of married women preparing and serving communal meals has been observed at Hopi (Schlegel 1977). Per- haps a similar system was used in the Casas Grandes region. Additionally, women were likely responsible for grinding maize on the large trough metates found throughout the Casas Grandes region (VanPool and Leonard 2002). Ideologically, gender complementarity is further supported by the mortuary practices at Paquime. Di Peso et al. (1974:8:359-364), Rakita (2001), Ravesloot (1988), and VanPool and Ogle-Leonard (2000) have demonstrated using grave goods, body position, and orientation that status and prestige crosscuts the sexes at Paquime. In fact, the grave goods did not reflect a sexual division of labor or systematic differences in gender-based status (Di Peso et al. 1974:8:364; Rakita 2001; VanPool and Ogle-Leonard 2000). Instead, mortuary practices appear to emphasize individual differences in pres- tige and perhaps class distinctions (Di Peso et al. 1974; Rakita 2001; Ravesloot 1988). Joyce (1996:188-190) notes that most Mesoamerican gender imagery de-emphasizes bio- logical sex in favor of nonreproductive gender markers. Similar patterns have been noted in the American Southwest (Crown 2000a:37, 40). Sur- prisingly, however, Casas Grandes imagery includes exaggerated and unambiguous depictions of primary and secondary characteristics along with different body proportions and activities preformed by males and female. Women are depicted with flar- ing hips, enlarged vulvas, and breasts, as well as giving birth. Males are depicted with penises that are sometimes disproportionately large, and are sometimes masturbating. The emphasis of females' large primary and sec- ondary sexual characteristics, pregnancy, birth, and nursing in Casas Grandes imagery suggests that fecundity may have been as important as shaman- ism. Possibly much of Casas Grandes ritual cycle had to do with birth, life and death, which is a com- mon theme among Puebloan groups (Kenagy 1986; Parsons 1996[1939]; Stevenson 1985[1904];Titiev 1992). However, most Southwestern human fig- urines including those of women do not emphasize primary sexual traits and reproduction (Hays- Gilpin 2000: 1 1 1-1 17), making the Casas Grandes effigies unique in the region. The structure of the Casas Grandes imagery thus suggests that gender symbolism sought to empha- size female productive and possibly reproductive power (e.g., raising macaws, serving with bowls, nursing), while at the same time emphasizing male ritual and the two-spirit phenomenon. This con- trasts sharply with Mesoamerican gender imagery such as that found among the Maya, which sought to de-emphasize female reproductive power but emphasized ritual and productive activities so as to tie women to subordinate roles within an overar- ching class structure (Joyce 1996:188-190). Paquime, the central ceremonial city of the Casas Grandes region, "has been widely recognized as one of the largest and most complex communities north of Mesoamerica" (Whalen and Minnis 2003:315). The emphasis of gender complemen- tarity in human figures and painted images indicates that gender was a fundamental aspect of the social organization and that emerging social differentia- tion was tied to the activities of both men and women, providing the opportunity for social pres- tige within the same framework. However, at the ideological level men and women become one- and-the-same with the shaman possessing both traits in the spiritual realm. Conclusions As Crown (2000a:33) observes, understanding how prehistoric gender is constructed in relation to worldview and ritual knowledge is difficult. We have examined Casas Grandes iconography, espe- cially human effigy vessels and painting of humans and anthropomorphic figures, to begin to under- stand how people of the Casas Grandes region defined and integrated gender roles, ideology, and ritual knowledge in their daily practice. The inter- relatedness of Casas Grandes cosmology makes it difficult to separate gender from other aspects of</page><page sequence="19">VanPool and VanPool] GENDER IN MIDDLE RANGE SOCIETIES 71 symbolism and social organization. Casas Grandes gender constructs are partly defined by their prox- imity not only to men and women, but to birds and serpents as well. Men and women had different roles, but they participated together in the same rit- ual structure, during which men conducted shamanic activity, which included smoking, danc- ing, and hallucinating, and women likely served as physical and spiritual helpers during the shaman's transformation and flight. Because of the general association between women and birds, women may have raised macaws and thereby supplied the feath- ers that were important during these rituals for para- phernalia such as the headdresses. They may have also served food during these rituals as illustrated by women holding bowls. In the mundane world and daily practice, men and women probably sat in very different stances. Women sat with their legs out and men sat with their legs pulled to their body. Biological differences were emphasized in Casas Grandes art. Women had flaring hips and bellies that were frequently reminiscent of pregnancy, and were shown breast- feeding and perhaps giving birth. Men were shown holding their penises and with straight bodies. Gender theorists have argued for over a decade that a gendered past is not only about determining what activities in which males and females partic- ipated but also about determining how gender struc- tured other aspects of social life (Brumfiel 1996; Conkey and Gero 1991; Costin 1996; Hill 1998:118-121). We argue that in Casas Grandes culture gender was based on complementarity that combined the productive and reproductive activi- ties of men and women within a single hierarchi- cal system. Within this system, the activities of women and men were both valued, and social dif- ferentiation was based more on individual status and class membership than sex and gender. The portrayal of the shaman as a two- spirit indi- vidual possessing both male and female traits fur- ther demonstrates the complementary nature of women and men within the Casas Grandes system; they were viewed as parts of a unified whole through duality. Although gender was a funda- mental organizing principle of the Casas Grandes region, emerging social differentiation was based on production and reproduction, which in turn likely corresponded with groups (classes) of asso- ciated men and women. In fact, the complemen- tary nature of gender likely made it possible for emerging elites to take advantage of the ritual and productive roles of both women and men to solid- ify their social position and to associate esoteric knowledge including ritual knowledge and power with a limited number of people, i.e., an elite class (see VanPool and VanPool 2003: 104-1 13 for a dis- cussion of the process of social stratification in the Casas Grandes region). Without the combined effort of both men and women, the social differ- entiation present at Paquime may have been impos- sible. This in turn suggests that gender complementarity may be an important factor con- tributing to the formation of social differentiation in many Middle Range societies. Acknowledgments.

However, Casas Grandes polychromes included human effigy jars that are globular jars painted with geometrical designs that have a human head molded on top of the jars. Because the bodies are globular jars with geometric designs, there is no unambiguous means of assigning sex and these vessels were not used in this study. 2. This male effigy vessel also was pear shaped, which is more typical of female Casas Grandes effigy vessels. 3. The mechanics of calculating adjusted residuals of chi- square analyses are presented by Everitt (1992:46-48). To summarize briefly, the standard residual is calculated for each cell of the matrix used in the chi-square test as e^in^-E^I^ where nt. is the observed value of the cell and E.. is the expected value of the cell. This value has been proven to be overly conservative, and must be transformed in an adjusted residual as follows: d^etj/jKl-ni/NXl-nj/N)] where etj is the standard residual, n~ is the row total and n. is the column total associated with the cell, and N is the grand total of the matrix. This value can then be compared to the critical values of the normal distribution for a two-tailed test of the desired alpha level, in this case 1.96 and -1.96 for an</page><page sequence="23">VanPool and VanPool] GENDER IN MIDDLE RANGE SOCIETIES 75 alpha of .05. 4. Regge Wiseman (2004, personal communication) tells us that Florence Hawley Ellis, during her Southwestern eth- nology courses at the University of New Mexico, reported that culturally defined rules required Puebloan women to adopted similar stances for modesty's sake. We have been unable to find written documentation to this effect, but the differences in posture may reflect pan-Southwestern gender constructs. 5. The Fisher's exact probability test is commonly used when analyzing 2x2 matrixes, so much so that it is frequently discussed only in that context (e.g., Bernard 1994: 442^43; Drennan 1996:197-198; Thomas 1986:298). However, the statistic can be generalized to infinitely large matrixes, including the 2x10 matrix in Table 5 (Everitt 1992:39). The complexity of the calculations increases greatly when larger tables are considered though. The association between the Fisher's exact probability test and 2x2 matrixes is a result of this increased complexity, in that the computational difficulty quickly exceeded the ability of people to calculate the statis- tic by hand. With the development of computers and statisti- cal software such as SAS, these limitations are no longer present (Everitt 1992:39^0). 6. Hays-Gilpin (2000:115) has reported a similar finding among Pueblo people, for whom the natural world is not par- titioned in binary oppositions. She too observes that the plumed/horned serpent has multiple characteristics. "The horned or feathered water serpent is both masculine and fem- inine and belongs to both the sky and the underworld beneath the waters" (Hays-Gilpin 2000:115), and "the notion of gen- der complementarity is both strong and flexible" (Hays- Gilpin 2000:115).
