(Allard Pierson Stichting, Uni- versiteit van Amsterdam, Archaeologisch-histo- rische Bijdragen, vol. 9) Pp. xii + 222, figs. 26. N. V. Noord-Hollandsche Uitgevers Mij, Amster- dam 1942. The Classical Greek stele has become so familiar to us that many an archaeologist is inclined to regard its shape, form, and function as something normal and self-evident. Van Hall's study of the questions connected with the origin and the reli- gious meaning of the Greek stelai is well calculated to jolt us out of any unthinking acquiescence. She begins with a critical survey of previous in- terpretations of the Greek grave stelai, a survey which amply demonstrates the difficulty of the prob- lem. The Greek grave stele has been interpreted as a marker to locate the tomb (Wiesner), as a re- ligious sign (L. Curtius), as the seat of the soul-bird (Weicker, Dragendorff), as a memorial (Collignon), as the pillar-dwelling of the ghost of the dead (A. Evans), as a symbol of resurrection (B. Kristensen), as the tree of life (J. Six), as the boundary-stone between life and death (Ch. Picard), as a weight intended to prevent the dead from returning, and as a refuge of the dead entrusted to Hermes (Rain- gaard). Other scholars have sought to combine sev- eral explanations; thus Moebius (RE, s.v. Stele) suggests that the stele was at first intended to pro- tect the living against the return of the dead; subsequently it became the seat of the soul-bird; later still, it was regarded as an honorific memorial; and finally, it assumed the function of a commem- orative portrait. Van Hall criticizes all these opinions with con- siderable vigor. Her incisive application of logic helps to clarify the issues, but one wonders whether in matters concerning death and afterlife there may not be less consistency in human emotions than logic would lead us to expect. What exactly do we in the twentieth century believe about the fate of the dead? And is not an ambivalence of feeling characteristic of many religions in their attitude toward the dead? Safety measures are not incon- sistent with love, nor is a certain feeling of awe and caution inconsistent with otherwise respectful and friendly behavior towards the dead. The author's ultimate aim is the elucidation of the origins of the Greek stele. Following the sound method of proceeding from the better known to the less well-known material, she discusses the Greek funerary monuments of the fifth and the fourth century B.C. before she attempts to interpret the stelai of earlier ages. She points out that Classical stelai with one figure indubitably represent the dead and are so described in poems and inscriptions. The interpretation of funerary reliefs which show two or more figures presents greater difficulties. In some cases, according to the accompanying inscrip- tions, all the persons represented are dead, but in others surviving members of the family seem to be represented together with the dead. In others yet most or all persons shown must have been alive when the monument was made. Throughout this discussion van Hall makes good observations. She notes, for instance, that in epitaphs as well as in sculptured monuments the emphasis is laid on gen- eral qualities rather than on individual traits - beauty, justice, virtue in the inscriptions; a beauti- ful woman, a dignified man, a valiant horseman in the reliefs. She pertinently reminds us that emphasis on typical elements is not confined to Greek art; conformity to a preconceived type can be found in the "aristocratic" portraits of England in the eight- eenth century and even in the "posed" family groups immortalized by Victorian photographers. She also offers some suggestive observations on the possible social and religious connotations of mirrors and ornaments seen in the portraits of the dead women on the Greek grave stelai. Van Hall apparently believes that the influence of hero-cults is at least partly responsible for the ideal- ized representation of the dead; resemblance to the</page><page sequence="2">1953] BOOK REVIEWS 231 actual man is not proper, if the dead is conceived of as a demi-god. One of the most difficult questions concerns the nature of the situations represented on the Greek grave stelai. The author denies Riezler's suggestion that all stelai represent scenes of daily life, although some may, and Furtwlingler's theory that they represent the dead in the underworld. She seems to assume a complex, composite meaning. Collignon's description of a family scene is quoted with approval: "La schne est conque comme une reunion de famille. N~anmoins l'idee de la mort est partout presente . .. c'est la mort elle-meme qui renouera les liens un instant brises .. .," and the author considers it equally possible that what S. Reinach calls "nullit6 de lieu," a refusal to describe the location as real or otherworldly, was character- istic of the Greek attitude. Elsewhere she suggests that the meaning may vary; conversations may por- tray typical family groups but may also depict a meeting with the ghost of the dead at the tomb, such as can be seen on the funerary lekythoi. She compares in literature the apparition of Sthenelos as described by Apollonios Rhodios. At any rate, the world of the dead and the world of the living are not poles apart. "The Greeks understood better than we the art of seeing the unseen and the super- natural in visible, daily life." She might have quoted here Beazley's fine analysis of the white lekythoi (Attic White Lekythoi 9 f.): "In many pic- tures two elements, a scene from life, and the tomb are simply juxtaposed. . . . Everyone understands nowadays that unity of time and space is not essen- tial in a picture. It is often sufficient description to say that the man now dead is shown in the company of those who loved him once and remember him now." For the grave stelai, the most recent study elaborates the theme of "unity in ambiguity" along the line envisaged by van Hall. In a series of thoughtful essays, K. Friis Johansen, The Attic Grave Reliefs (1951), suggests that the dead are depicted as still living yet at the same time as really dead; he, too, feels that hero-like dignity was still thought to be a portion of the dead and that this sentiment is conveyed by subtle details in the reliefs. Most significant for the "popular" and possibly con- ventional (as against the intellectualized) attitude of the late Classical age toward death is Johansen's observation that the handshake represents a kind of treaty, an assertion of the continued bond of family relationship which death cannot break. The heroes of the Persian Wars and the Athenian warriors cele- brated by Perikles found immortality in the eternal fame of their achievements for the entire commu- nity of the city state. The grave reliefs of the late fifth and the fourth centuries reflect a withdrawal into the private sphere of the family. It is the human relations within the inner family circle, the ties between parents and children, brothers and sisters which are seen as perennially valid. There are over- tones of heroization, but it is a heroization of love and affection, a belief that while the individual members of the family may pass from one plane of existence to another, those who have lived to- gether in this life, will live on together. Van Hall then surveys the different types of grave monuments current in the archaic period. Her ac- count of Attic funerary monuments of the sixth century may be considerably amplified with material from Richter's excellent study, Archaic Attic Grave- stones (1944), from G. Karo's An Attic Cemetery (1943), and from Johansen's chapter devoted to archaic grave reliefs of all Greece. She has collected some material on the funerary use of the kouroi and the korai; she discusses the loutrophoroi and lekythoi placed on the tombs and suggests that the concept of the bride of Hades may have had some influence, at least in the case of young women. It may not be amiss to recall that cult-images and votive statues seem to have preceded sepulchral statues and reliefs. The rise of anthropomorphic representations of "real" life-size over the graves appears to this reviewer to reflect a change of ideas about the dead. There is a considerable difference between a stone pillar, even if it is believed to be a "second body" of the dead or a seat of the soul, and statues such as the kouros in the Metropolitan Museum and the Dipylon kouros in which the man is fashioned in the likeness of a god. Homer's heroes were "god-like" in life but not in their monuments after death. The funerary statue and the funerary relief afforded a new kind of immortality, one in which the fame and "god-likeness" of the dead could be preserved in concrete and identifiable form. This fundamental change, which occurred in the seventh century, receives but little attention from van Hall, who centers her inquiry upon the possible aniconic forerunners of the Greek stele and upon the sig- nificance of the terms "herm" and "colossus." In the archaeological part of this inquiry the au- thor lists the simple slabs of the eighth and seventh century (Athens, Amorgos, Eretria, Thera, cf. Rich- ter, Gravestones, 7 f.) as well as the stelai from Neandria with rudimentary arms. She compares these with the stones which were seen by Pausanias on tombs of legendary heroes (Phokos, Tydeus, Neoptolemos). Homer, too, knows of stelai placed on mounds in honor of the dead. Since some scholars have suggested that cremation (H. L. Lori- mer, Homer and the Monuments [1950] 103 ff., G. E. Mylonas, AJA 52 [1948] 79 f.) and burial mounds</page><page sequence="3">232 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AJA 57 may have been borrowed by the Greeks from the Anatolians, it is of some interest that stelai, too, appear in Homeric passages which refer to non- Greek tombs: the prospective burial of Sarpedon in Lycia and the tomb of Ilos (Iliad 16.457 and 11.371). Recent excavations at Gordion have brought to light curious anthropomorphic stones from Phrygian mound burials (R. S. Young, Philadelphia Museum Bull. 16 [May 1950] 17, pl. 8,2); it remains to be seen whether they were serving the same functions as the Homeric stelai. Plain stelai have also been found over some of the cremation burials at Hama in Syria which present curious parallels to Homeric burial rites and belong to the "Homeric" age (ca. 1250-720 B.c., cf. P. J. Riis Hama 11.3 [1948] 28, 43, fig. 18). Van Hall maintains that the early Greek stelai like the Mycenaean ones functioned as substitutes, which provided a kind of second body for the sur- viving spirits (psyche, eidolon). To prove this con- tention she introduces the two "menhirs" found by Persson in the Chamber Tomb No. 2 at Dendra (Royal Tombs of Dendra [1931] 73 ff., 108 ff. My- lonas, loc. cit., 75 f., for the special nature of the ritual) and interpreted by him as the substitute bodies of two princes who died abroad; two statues found in a tomb at Thera; and a stone found in a cenotaph in the Kerameikos. According to her, these stones are similar to the eidola used in the burial rites for Spartan kings who died abroad (Herodotus 6.58). Actually, the most that these cases prove is that in some exceptional instances stones might have served as substitutes for the dead who could not be buried properly; a very different thing from a general belief in the need of the dead for substitute bodies of stone. To bolster her theory of a primitive Greek belief in substitute bodies, van Hall seeks to show that the pre-Greek word kolossos had the meaning of "up- right," "living" stone; in this she follows the in- genious essay on pre-Greek and Greek words for "statue" by E. Benveniste, RevPhil 6 (1932) 118 ff. She then repeats Benveniste's survey of ancient ref- erences to kolossoi: the enigmatic "well-shaped colossi" of Aeschylus, Agamemnon 408 and the laws of Thera and Cyrene in which kolossoi are puppets used as substitutes for somebody absent or unknown. But even if we grant that kolossos was an inherited pre-Greek term for a substitute puppet or "double"; even if we admit the Hesychian gloss alybantes: kolossoi, nekroi as proof that kolossoi could sub- stitute for dead people; we still lack any cogent proof that kolossos ever had the meaning of stele or "grave stone." Van Hall's third argument is drawn from a most controversial source - the Greek herm. She argues that in Cicero's sentence about the prohibition of sumptuous tombs in Athens (De Legg. 2.26.34) the word hermae covers all sculptured representations of the dead (cf. Richter, Gravestones 9, n. 23). She suggests that "hermes" originally meant "dead man" and not a god. The stone-heap herm was originally the second body intended as receptacle for the soul. Later "the dead" was raised to the stature of "The Dead One," or the God of the Dead. The use of herms along the roads was a secondary development, which originated in the ancient practice of placing tombs along the roads. Eventually, the stone pillars of the dead became phallic herms. Since she accepts the statement of Herodotus (2.51) that the Athenians had taken over such herms from the Pelasgians, the entire process must presumably be envisaged as having taken place in Prehistoric times. By the time of Hipparchus, herms were firmly associated with the cult of Hermes in the countryside; he merely gave official status to the existing rural cult. As far as Hermes is concerned, it is very doubtful that this interpretation does justice to a very complex figure. It will be sufficient to refer to H. J. Rose, Ancient Greek Religion (1946) 62; J. Chittenden AJA 52 (1948) 24 ff. and Rhys Carpenter AJA 54 (1950) 177 ff. Methodically, van Hall's procedure recalls the beautiful simplicity with which Herbert Spencer explained the origin of idolatry: "A rudely carved or modeled image of a man placed on his grave gave origin to sculptured representation of a god enclosed in his temple." Yet it is not likely that this "euhe- meristic" reconstruction holds for Greece in general and for Hermes in particular. The author seems to assume that the cult of the dead is a general human trait and that ancestor worship develops in all cultures along similar lines; otherwise her elaborate comparisons with Indonesia and China would be quite beside the point. Actually, considerable un- certainty prevails concerning the extent of the cult of the dead in Prehistoric Greece (G. E. Mylonas, Studies D. M. Robinson [1951] 64 ff.); and no ethno- graphic parallels can counterbalance specific state- ments by Greek writers about the meaning of the Greek stelai. In Homer, honor to the dead is the prime mean- ing of the stelai; the stone is intended to show to men of later days that the mound is not an acci- dental heap of earth but the burial of a hero (cf. A. D. Nock, JBL 60 [1941] 95). In the inscriptions, the early sculptured stelai are called semata, "signs," or mnemata, "memorials"; not "herms," or "eidola," or "kolossoi." As far as safe evidence carries, the stelai were used to indicate the place of the tomb and to preserve the memory of the dead. For the</page><page sequence="4">1953] BOOK REVIEWS 233 Bronze Age of Greece, we have only archaeological evidence. If the Prehistoric Greeks believed in stones or stelai as substitute bodies, we should expect to find stones or stelai corresponding in number to the number of burials in each tomb. This does not seem to be the case (cf. G. E. Mylonas AJA 52 [1948] 71 f.); it is not even certain that there was always a stone marker for each tomb. The Shaft Graves of Mycenae were Royal burials and hence special cases. We cannot be sure about the meaning of the plain stelai and those with geometric decoration; but those with figurative reliefs represent the dead at war or hunting (or chariot racing, according to Mylonas AJA 55 [1951] 134 ff.). They commemorate the deeds of the dead and cannot be thought of as "second bodies." If there was any intention to create a physical abode for the surviving soul, the masks of gold which perpetuated the individual faces would be more probable repositories. The weakness of van Hall's book lies in her attempt to find a unilateral explanation for a vari- ety of heterogeneous phenomena; its strength lies in the comprehensive learning and in the searching investigation of such special problems as those of cenotaphs and substitutes. In any case, a book like this has a moral for field archaeologists: never over- look a stone, be it ever so humble--it may turn out to be a grave stele! GEORGE M. A.
