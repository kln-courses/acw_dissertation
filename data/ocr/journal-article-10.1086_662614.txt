        <p>Recent research has demonstrated automatic behavioral priming effects in the domain of
            brands. Building on prior research in social psychology that has shown that people
            sometimes take on the behaviors they associate with other individuals or social groups
            (e.g., Bargh, Chen, and Burrows 1996),
            Fitzsimons, Chartrand, and Fitzsimons (2008)
            found that brand exposure may elicit automatic behavioral effects consistent with the
            brand image. For example, participants exposed to the Apple brand behaved more
            creatively and those exposed to the Disney brand responded more honestly, compared to
            controls. These findings of “social” influence for nonhuman stimuli stand in
            contrast to prior work that failed to find some basic social perception effects for
            brands (Lingle, Alton, and Medin 1984) and with
            research arguing that brands elicit weaker effects than people and occupy roles of much
            less importance than those occupied by humans (Sujan and Bettman 1989).</p>
        <p>An explanation for this difference in findings might be that the iconic brands studied by
            Fitzsimons et al. (2008) were perceived much
            like people. That is, respondents may have anthropomorphized those brands, resulting in
            the effects of these brands spilling into the social world. This explanation accords
            with Lingle et al. (1984), who suggested that
            brands that are not naturally anthropomorphized are those for which social effects may
            be less likely to occur. We examine this possibility in the present research by
            considering differences in people’s behavior when primed with brands that have
            been anthropomorphized compared to those represented only as objects.</p>
        <p>One key contribution of this research, therefore, is to test the premise that automatic
            behavioral priming effects as noted in prior research depend on the extent to which the
            primed category or object is anthropomorphized. By anthropomorphizing brands, consumers
            open the door to “quasi social influences” in which brands elicit effects
            previously seen for responses to people. That is, these automatic effects of brand
            exposure documented in the literature would suggest not that social effects extend to
            inanimate objects and brands but rather that inanimate objects and brands may sometimes
            extend into the social realm.</p>
        <p>A second contribution of this research is to propose the process by which automatic
            behavior results from anthropomorphized brand primes. Following Fitzsimons et al. (2008), we, too, suggest that automatic behavior in
            response to brand exposure follows a motivational process. Fitzsimons et al. (2008) argued that consumers are motivated by their
            desire to achieve the key personality or trait dimension associated with the brand. For
            example, most consumers would like to be creative and honest, and hence when primed with
            a brand that stands for either of these traits, such as Apple or Disney, they behave in
            a manner consistent with that trait. Our theorizing of the motivational process is
            somewhat broader than, although compatible with, the one proposed by Fitzsimons et al.
                (2008). We suggest that the automatic
            behavior that people display subsequent to being primed with a brand is motivated by a
            desire to achieve an effective interaction with the anthropomorphized brand rather than
            just by a desire to take on an admirable characteristic associated with it.</p>
        <p>As a foundation for our framework, we rely on the work by Cesario, Plaks, and Higgins
                (2006), who have demonstrated that priming a
            social group triggers goals corresponding to people’s desire for a successful
            social interaction (see also Cesario et al. 2010). People’s behavior is dependent on the extent to which that behavior
            enables them to achieve these interaction goals. Those goals may be positive, such as
            getting along well with the other person, or negative, such as getting away from the
            person as soon as possible. These researchers thus showed that priming a stereotyped
            group such as the “elderly” led to participants walking more slowly if the
            participants liked members of the category and hence wanted to get along with them
            (Bargh et al. 1996). However, participants who
            disliked the primed category of the “elderly” walked faster, since an
            effective way to interact with such a disliked category would be to get away from
            someone in that category.</p>
        <p>Building on this research, we predict that a brand prime will lead to assimilation or
            contrast from the behavior implied by the brand image depending on consumers’
            beliefs about how best to achieve their social interaction goals. In order to test this
            prediction, we adopted two potential moderators of the brand prime effect: liking for
            the brand and the type of relationship with or role ascribed to the brand. Our
            expectation is that the effect of liking will reverse depending on the perceived role,
            specifically, whether the brand is seen as partnering the consumer or serving her.
            Brands take on a partnering role if they are seen as coproducers of the benefit, working
            together with the consumer to meet the need. On the other hand, brands take on a servant
            role if they are seen as taking care of the need on behalf of the consumer—much
            like the consumer contracting out the task to the brand.</p>
        <p>In the case of anthropomorphized brands that are seen as partners, liking the brand would
            suggest assimilating the behavior associated with the brand image because shared action
            is the best way to interact with the coproducer. Taking on the behaviors of a partner
            brand that is liked signals “let’s team up.” By contrast, an effective
            way to behave around a brand that presents itself as a partner but which is disliked is
            to act unlike the brand because acting in contrast to the brand’s image undermines
            working together, which would dissuade this disliked brand from sticking around. In
            short, we expect an assimilation effect for anthropomorphized brands that are seen in a
            partner role if they are liked and a contrast effect if they are disliked.</p>
        <p>However, for anthropomorphized brands that are seen as taking on a servant role, we
            expect an opposite effect. In this case, taking on the behavior of the servant signals
            “I don’t need you, so go away,” whereas doing the opposite of the
            servant’s association signals “I need your help, so please come
            closer.” Thus, for anthropomorphized brands seen as servants, liking the brand
            would suggest that the servant be invited to do its job, leading to a behavior that is
            contrastive to the brand’s image. In contrast, an effective way to behave with an
            anthropomorphized servant brand that is disliked is to obviate the need to have the
            brand around, thereby assimilating to the behavior suggested by the brand’s image.
            Hence, we predict assimilation for servant brands that are disliked and contrast for
            servant brands that are liked. Note that a neutral action, neither assimilation nor
            contrast, would not undermine the social interaction with a liked servant brand because,
            by not taking on the same activities, at least the person would be staying out of the
            servant’s way. However, we predict a true contrast effect because it provides a
            strong signal to draw in the liked, humanized brand. Given the premise that these
            effects depend on whether or not consumers anthropomorphize the brand, which triggers
            goals for successful social interaction, we do not expect any moderation by role or
            liking for nonanthropomorphized brands.</p>
        <p>In the following sections, we elaborate the conceptual framework introduced above, first
            by addressing the concept of anthropomorphism in marketing and then by discussing
            automatic behavioral priming effects for anthropomorphized brands. We then test our
            proposed framework in three studies.</p>
        <sec id="sc1">
            <title>Anthropomorphism</title>
            <p>Anthropomorphism is the attribution of uniquely human characteristics and features to
                nonhuman creatures and beings, natural and supernatural phenomena, material states
                or objects, and even abstract concepts (Epley, Waytz, and Cacioppo 2007). Anthropomorphism occurs frequently in
                marketing, sometimes because marketers suggest humanizing the brand or product and
                sometimes because consumers readily see the human in the nonhuman. For example,
                products have often been given humanlike characteristics to make them more
                distinctive and memorable (e.g., the hourglass form of the Coke bottle), to assign
                specific qualities that exemplify what they stand for (e.g., the shape of the front
                grille of the Thunderbird to give it a tough look), and to make them more endearing
                and likeable (e.g., ads for analog clocks and wristwatches commonly show 10:10 time
                to make them look like a smiling face). Products are sometimes even perceived to
                have a soul (Gilmore 1919) or a genetic code
                (McGill 1998) much like humans do.</p>
            <p>Similarly, brands are known to have distinctive humanlike personality traits (Aaker
                    1997). Consumers also form relationships
                with brands (Fournier 1998) and develop
                distinct communities around them (Muniz and O’Guinn 2001). Even though researchers generally focus on particular
                humanlike characteristics such as personality or relationships when examining
                brands, these effects presumably emanate out of the more generalized act of
                anthropomorphizing the brand. In fact, brand managers often encourage this
                phenomenon of anthropomorphizing by creating brand characters, mascots, and
                spokespeople such as the Pillsbury Doughboy, the Green Giant, Tony the Tiger, or the
                more contemporary Geico Gecko. Brands are given faces and names, and they are
                endowed with human emotions. Brand names are sometimes chosen to conjure up imagery
                of real people (e.g., Mr. Kleen or Mrs. Fields), and brand communication often
                involves using first-person language as if the brand were talking directly to the
                consumers as people do.</p>
            <p>Given the pervasive use of anthropomorphism by marketers, it is quite surprising that
                academic research in the area has been extremely limited (for exceptions, see
                Aggarwal and McGill 2007; Chandler and
                Schwarz 2010; Kim and McGill 2011). Although researchers have looked at
                related issues, such as brand personality (Aaker 1997), consumer-brand relationships (Aggarwal 2004; Fournier 1998),
                brand imagery (Batra and Homer 2004), brand
                identity (Schmitt, Simonson, and Marcus 1995), and brand communities (Muniz and O’Guinn 2001), there has been very limited research directly examining
                the effects of bringing the brand to life. In this article, we attempt to fill this
                gap in part by exploring how priming an anthropomorphized brand, in contrast to an
                objectified brand, might affect people’s everyday behavior beyond the context
                of immediate brand consumption. In our studies, we employ a direct instruction to
                imagine the brand coming to life as a person and to imagine its personality,
                physical appearance, opinions, occupation, approach, and so forth. This instruction
                was intended to suggest a wholly formed person, thereby triggering goals for a
                social interaction, even if no such interaction was actually forthcoming. We then
                examine participants’ actions in subsequent unrelated tasks.</p>

            <title>Automatic Behavioral Priming</title>
            <p>Prior research has shown that activation of a social category may produce behavior
                that is consistent with the stereotype of the primed category. For example, Bargh et
                al. (1996) first observed that priming the
                construct of the “elderly’” led participants to walk more slowly,
                an effect that appears to occur automatically, outside conscious awareness. This
                general effect of assimilation of behavior in keeping with the primed concept or
                category has been replicated in a variety of different contexts: priming
                “professors” increased performance on a general knowledge task, whereas
                priming “hooligans” reduced performance on the same task (Dijksterhuis
                and van Knippenberg 1998); priming the
                “elderly” reduced performance on a memory task (Dijksterhuis et al.
                    2000), and priming
                “politician” increased the length of one’s essays, suggesting
                greater long-windedness (Dijksterhuis and van Knippenberg 2000).</p>
            <p>Various cognitive and motivational explanations have been posited for this effect
                (Bargh et al. 1996, 2001; Cesario et al. 2006; Chartrand and Bargh 1996;
                Dijksterhuis and Bargh 2001; Kay and Ross
                    2003; Smeesters et al. 2003; Wheeler and Petty 2001). The predominant cognitive account suggests that priming
                influences behavior through a direct perception-behavior link, which works according
                to the principles of spreading activation (Dijksterhuis and Bargh 2001). The salience of a particular construct
                activates the corresponding internal representation of the construct. The activation
                of the construct also activates all the related features, including behavioral
                tendencies associated with it. And once the behavioral representation is activated,
                it becomes more likely to be acted upon than if it were not activated. The
                activation of a particular construct thus leads to a greater likelihood of
                nonconscious behavior associated with that construct.</p>
            <sec id="sc2.1">
                <title>Priming Effects Are Not Always Assimilative</title>
                <p>More recent work suggests, however, that the behavior subsequent to the priming
                    of a social category might be motivational. Thus, Cesario et al. (2006) suggest that people’s behavior
                    is often driven by a desire to interact effectively. Hence, when a particular
                    social category is made salient (e.g., elderly), people’s motivational
                    system begins to prepare for an interaction with a member of the primed
                    category. As such, the subsequent behavioral response is a function of the
                    characteristics of the primed category (e.g., walks slowly) as well as of
                    one’s affective evaluation of the target (e.g., Do I like this person?).
                    This goal-based automatic behavioral response thus raises the possibility of
                    contrast effects in response to the priming of a concept. For example, as noted
                    in the introduction, Cesario et al. (2006) showed that people who have a positive attitude toward the
                    elderly walk slowly once primed with the “elderly” construct since
                    that is presumably the most effective way of interacting with them. However,
                    those who have a negative attitude toward the elderly walk faster rather than
                    slower after being primed with this category because this behavior would
                    facilitate getting away from the disliked group. Thus, it is not just the
                    association of a trait (walking slowly) with a category (elderly) that
                    determines what the behavioral response would be but also the individual’s
                    attitude toward the category (like or dislike) and what is seen as the most
                    effective way to interact with a member of this primed category. This research
                    also suggests that the mere priming of the category is sufficient to bring the
                    social goals to mind; anticipation of an actual, upcoming interaction with a
                    member of that category is not necessary and the behavior may be observed in
                    subsequent unrelated tasks.</p>
                <p>Cesario et al. (2006) also stress that
                    the pattern of assimilation or contrast is not as simple as “if like,
                    assimilate and if dislike, contrast.” Instead, assimilative or contrastive
                    behavior is determined by which route best achieves the desired social goal, an
                    idea we exploit in our use of the partner and servant roles. People who dislike
                    a social group may show behavioral assimilation if doing so facilitates the
                    social goal of pushing this group away or expressing disdain. For example,
                    Cesario et al. (2006) demonstrated that
                    people who dislike the social group African American may adopt the trait of
                    being aggressive or hostile, which is part of the stereotype of this social
                    group, because acting in this manner best achieves social goals of keeping
                    members of this disliked group at a distance.</p>
                <p>Other work has also highlighted assimilative and contrastive automatic behavior
                    in response to a prime. For example, Wheeler and Berger (2007) note that differential behavioral effects can result
                    from differences in the associations about the primed concept. For example,
                    these authors show that men look at shopping as purpose-driven, whereas women
                    look at it as possibility-driven, and in subsequent tasks the two behave
                    accordingly. Mandel and Johnson (2002),
                    studying expertise and search, highlight the underlying processes, such as the
                    type of search (external vs. internal), that result in differences in the type
                    of behavior in response to a prime. Laran, Janiszewski, and Cunha (2008) note the influence of the context of
                    goal pursuit, finding assimilation to a primed goal when the behavioral context
                    is common but contrast when the context is uncommon. Laran, Dalton, and Andrade
                        (2011) recently reported
                    assimilation effects of a brand prime but contrast effects of a slogan, tracing
                    the effects to nonconscious efforts to correct for persuasive influence of
                    slogans but not brand primes.</p>
                <p>Of particular relevance to the present investigation is recent research by
                    Smeesters et al. (2009), which examined
                    participants’ decisions in a mixed-motive game following a conceptual
                    prime. These authors categorized people according to their social value
                    orientation and found that priming a morality concept led to more cooperative
                    behavior among participants whose goals were to maximize joint outcomes, an
                    assimilation effect. However, the same prime led to competitive behavior among
                    participants whose goals were to maximize their own outcomes, a contrast from
                    the prime. Ironically, when primed with morality, those who were motivated to
                    get ahead expected their partners to be more cooperative and hence ripe for
                    exploitation through competitive actions. These findings demonstrate that the
                    effect of a prime depends on participants’ goals for a successful
                    interaction. Whereas Smeesters et al. (2009) relied on social value orientation to manipulate goals, we
                    examine goals implied by different brand roles.</p>

                <title>Brand Roles: Partner versus Servant</title>
                <p>An emerging stream of work stresses the importance of understanding the
                    relationship between consumers and brands, not just the static image of the
                    brand in isolation. The main thesis of this stream of work is that consumers may
                    sometimes think of brands as relational partners, much like their social
                    interpersonal counterparts. For example, consumers may assign very specific
                    roles to brands, conceiving of them as committed partners, marriages of
                    convenience, or even enslavements, among many others (Fournier 1998). Aggarwal (2004) suggests that consumers use norms of interpersonal
                    relationships to guide their behavior when interacting with brands that they
                    have an exchange relationship with, much like a business partner, or a communal
                    relationship with, much like a friend. We suggest that the type of role that
                    consumers assign to a particular brand would, in fact, influence their motivated
                    preparation to interact with an anthropomorphized version of that brand and the
                    consequent behavior in response to the brand prime.</p>
                <p>In our studies, we focus on two specific roles that may be assigned to brands:
                    the role of a partner (or the coproducer of the benefit) and the role of a
                    servant (or the outsourced provider of the benefit). We chose to focus on this
                    distinction because it affords a strong test of our theory based on motivated
                    preparation to interact. These roles suggest distinctive behaviors to achieve a
                    successful social interaction, and, critically, we expect the effect of liking
                    to reverse across roles.</p>
                <p>Recent work by Bolton et al. (2008) on the
                    differences in effectiveness in the marketing of drugs versus nutritional
                    supplements provided a very useful support for the type of moderator that we
                    were seeking. Bolton et al. (2008) found
                    that drugs are perceived as providing cures for the ailment and hence reduce the
                    patient’s motivation to adopt any other health-inducing behaviors in
                    conjunction with the consumption of drugs. In contrast, nutritional supplements
                    are seen as just that—supplements—and hence do not reduce the
                    motivation of the patient to also adopt other positive health-inducing
                    behaviors. What these authors have shown, therefore, is that the role assigned
                    to the health intervention object is crucial in determining the patient’s
                    behavioral response. Interpreting these results for our purposes, we saw
                    supplements as occupying a partnering role, leading to assimilative behavior,
                    but drugs as occupying a servant role, leading to contrastive behavior.</p>
                <p>Following this reasoning, we adopted a partner-servant distinction to reveal
                    assimilative or contrastive effects of a brand prime. Hence, it is important to
                    underscore the rationale for studying the role variable. Although the
                    distinction between the partner and the servant roles is interesting in itself,
                    and something that may be investigated in future research, our main goal is to
                    use these two brand roles to test the theory of how brand anthropomorphism
                    influences automatic behavior in response to brand primes, in particular,
                    through motivated preparation to interact. Adopting a partner versus a servant
                    role distinction helps us propose and test our specific and opposing predictions
                    because these roles suggest different ways to achieve a successful interaction.
                    By no means do we wish to suggest that these two roles are the only, or even the
                    predominant, roles assigned to brands. It is also beyond the scope of this
                    article to examine the antecedent factors or processes that give rise to these
                    role perceptions in an ongoing consumer-brand interaction. Consequently, in this
                    article, we merely use these two brand roles—partner versus
                    servant—to test our hypothesis that the desire for a successful
                    interaction with the anthropomorphized brand is the primary driver of
                    assimilative or contrastive consumer behavior in response to a brand prime.
                    Having said this, it is interesting to note that instances of marketers
                    promoting their brands in a partner or a servant role are relatively common; for
                    example, Allianz, one of the world’s leading financial organizations has
                    the core value of being a “trusted partner” to its customers, while
                    the Scrubbing Bubbles brand from S. C. Johnson and Co. is positioned as a
                    servant for its customers, as is clear from its advertising tagline “We
                    work hard so you don’t have to.”</p>
                <p>We should also note that, within our studies, the brand serves as a mere prime
                    and does not directly figure in the context in which we later examine
                    participants’ behavior. An anthropomorphized brand leads to a goal of
                    having a successful social interaction. However, we are not assuming that the
                    brand be purchased, consumed, or used. That is, once the brand has been brought
                    to life in the consumer’s mind, the goal is about the social interaction
                    implied by the brand and not the commercial interaction in terms of purchase or
                    consumption. Of course, the marketplace positioning of the brand will surely
                    determine what is perceived as a successful social interaction. For example,
                    imagine that the Kellogg’s brand, which is positioned around health
                    benefits, is brought to life as an uber-fit health fanatic inclined to burning
                    calories at any given opportunity and, further, that this brand is seen as a
                    partner to the consumer. In this case, if one likes the brand, one may be more
                    likely to behave in a manner that is consistent with being active and healthy.
                    On the other hand, if Kellogg’s is brought to life as a partner brand but
                    it is also disliked, then when primed with this brand, one may opt to act like a
                    couch potato just to put off such a brand-person. That is, you might believe in
                    the goal of fitness, but you may also dislike Kellogg’s. Hence, when
                    primed with the humanized version of Kellogg’s, you may be willing to lose
                    on the fitness goal just to get the disliked brand-person away from you.
                    Similarly, imagine that Volvo, the car brand that is positioned on safety, is
                    brought to life as a servant intent on taking care of its employer/master. In
                    this case, if one likes the brand, one may be more likely to take risks and
                    behave rashly as a way to invite in the brand, even if it means deviating
                    (temporarily) from the goal of safety. On the other hand, when Volvo the servant
                    brand is brought to life, and one dislikes it, one may be more likely to signal
                    to the servant brand that it is not needed and thus to behave in a
                    brand-consistent manner of caution and reserve.</p>
                <p>In sum, therefore, the one paramount goal that is triggered by anthropomorphizing
                    the brand is to have a successful social interaction with the humanized entity,
                    not necessarily the attainment of the consumption benefit implied by the brand
                    as a commercial entity. This is in keeping with findings from prior research
                    examining the effects of goal primes that notes that “the goal priming
                    context need not be associated with the goal pursuit context … the goal
                    prime exerts an influence because it activates information that is applicable in
                    a common behavioral context, even though the goal priming context is unrelated
                    to the behavioral context” (Laran et al. 2008, 655). Thus, we propose that the brand prime will suggest,
                    based on brand liking and brand role, a specific behavioral action for a
                    successful social interaction with the anthropomorphized brand, which will be
                    observed in subsequent contexts unrelated to brand consumption. Hence, we may
                    prime Volvo, which triggers behaviors related to acting prudently or recklessly
                    depending on liking and perceived brand role, and we observe these behaviors in
                    a subsequent gambling task.</p>

                <title>Pilot Studies</title>
                <p>To get some empirical validation for this intuition on the assimilative and
                    contrastive behavioral response to the partner versus servant roles being
                    moderated by liking, we conducted a set of pilot studies. The first pilot study
                    was conducted among 155 undergraduate students at the University of Toronto to
                    examine if, in fact, there are certain interpersonal interactions that are more
                    likely to be seen as a partner relationship and some other more likely to be
                    seen as a servant relationship. Results show that people such as a doctor, a
                    nutritionist, a tennis coach, a professor, a priest, a lawyer, a tutor, a
                    real-estate agent, a personal trainer, an interior designer, a physiotherapist,
                    a music teacher, and an income-tax consultant are all seen more as partners (all
                        <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). In contrast, people such as a taxi driver, a
                    mechanic, a dog walker, a janitor, a babysitter, an airline hostess, a
                    hairstylist, a sales rep, and an electrician are all seen more as servants (all
                        <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). While some of the occupations are naturally
                    associated with a partner role and others with a servant role, we were
                    interested in examining the extent to which manipulating the same occupation
                    into partner versus servant roles would lead to different expectations about how
                    people are likely to behave. Consequently, we conducted a separate pilot study
                    to examine the extent to which people will assimilate or contrast their behavior
                    in their interaction with a partner or a servant depending upon whether they
                    like or dislike this person.</p>
                <p>We showed a group of 86 undergraduate students a brief scenario describing four
                    different people (a tennis coach, a tutor, a proofreader, and a party planner),
                    all presenting themselves in a servant role. Further, the participants were told
                    that they either liked this person a lot or disliked this person. Finally, they
                    were asked to state, on a 9-point scale, the extent to which they were likely to
                    present themselves as someone who has similar characteristics as the person in
                    the servant role (e.g., fast reader, creative party planner). Combined results
                    for these four scenarios showed that those who liked the servants were less
                    likely to assimilate with the servant’s characteristics than those who
                    disliked the servants (<italic>M</italic>

                    was conducted in which the person was described as a partner (a tennis buddy, a
                    group project member helping you study, a cowriter who also proofreads for you,
                    and a co–office bearer on a student society jointly organizing a party),
                    in which a group of 84 participants were told that they either liked the person
                    concerned or disliked the person. As before, they were asked to state, on a
                    9-point scale, the extent to which they were likely to present themselves as
                    having similar characteristics as the person described in the partner role
                    (e.g., serious and careful, interested in cross-cultural issues). Combined
                    results for the four scenarios show that those who liked the partners were more
                    likely to assimilate with the partner’s characteristics than those who
                    disliked the partners (<italic>M</italic>

                    a strong initial validation to our thesis that people will assimilate behaviors
                    in line with those of their liked partners but contrast away from those of their
                    liked servants.</p>

                <title>Hypotheses</title>
                <p>To summarize, when anthropomorphized, a partner brand that a consumer likes will
                    encourage the consumer to assimilate the behavior suggested by the brand in a
                    subsequent unrelated context since working collaboratively is the most effective
                    way to interact with a liked partner; similarly, a partner brand that a consumer
                    dislikes will encourage a contrastive behavior from the consumer in the
                    subsequent unrelated context since that is the most effective way to persuade a
                    disliked partner to go away. The brand’s role of a servant rather than
                    partner suggests the opposite effects. A servant brand that a consumer likes
                    will encourage a contrastive behavior in a subsequent unrelated context since
                    the most effective way to draw the humanized brand closer is to allow the
                    servant brand to do its job. Finally, a servant brand that one dislikes will
                    suggest behaving in an assimilative manner since the most effective way to make
                    the brand go away is to preclude the need for the brand to be around.</p>
                <p>These assertions are consistent with, and can also account for, the findings of
                    Fitzsimons et al. (2008). Both Apple and
                    Disney are ready candidates for anthropomorphizing by consumers, and, in fact,
                    Apple has been anthropomorphized in a long-running advertising campaign (i.e.,
                    I’m a Mac), while the Disney brand derives from a real person as well as
                    many lovable characters, such as Mickey Mouse, associated with the brand.
                    Further, admired brands like Apple and Disney are more likely to be seen in a
                    partnership rather than a servant role, as well as more likely to be liked
                    rather than disliked, resulting in the assimilative effect reported by
                    Fitzsimons et al. (2008).</p>
                <p>The prediction for nonanthropomorphized brands is less clear. On the one hand, we
                    might expect no effect of brand priming given prior research that has failed to
                    show social effects for things (e.g., Lingle et al. 1984). In this case, we would not expect an effect for
                    liking since there is no fundamental effect of brand priming to moderate.
                    Alternatively, if the brand image is extremely well developed, a cognitive
                    account based on the perception-behavior link may apply (Bargh et al. 1996). That is, cognitive representation of
                    the brand image may spread to the representation of the behavior associated with
                    the image increasing the likelihood of consumers producing that behavior.
                    However, for nonanthropomorphized brands, we still do not expect moderation of
                    the effect depending on liking because the spreading activation process is not
                    dependent on attitude or goals with respect to the brand. Finally, we do not
                    expect any effect of brand role since the proposed differences due to partner or
                    servant roles for anthropomorphized brands are due to the brand being perceived
                    like a human. For brands that are seen as objects or things, we do not expect
                    brand role to act as a moderating variable. Thus, our first hypothesis, which
                    applies to brands that are seen as being in partnership with the consumer,
                    identifies a two-way interaction of anthropomorphism and liking as
                                follows:<statement>
                  <label>
                     <bold>H1:</bold>: </label>
                  <p>For partner
                            brands that are liked, consumers are more likely to assimilate their
                            behavior to the brand image when primed with an anthropomorphized brand
                            compared to a nonanthropomorphized brand; for partner brands that are
                            disliked, consumers are more likely to contrast their behavior from the
                            brand image when primed with an anthropomorphized brand compared to a
                            nonanthropomorphized brand.</p>
               </statement>
            </p>
                <p>Our second hypothesis, for a brand perceived as a servant to the consumer, makes
                    the opposite predictions: <statement>
                  <label>
                     <bold>H2:</bold>: </label>
                  <p>For
                            servant brands that are disliked, consumers are more likely to
                            assimilate their behavior to the brand image when primed with an
                            anthropomorphized brand compared to a nonanthropomorphized brand; for
                            servant brands that are liked, consumers are more likely to contrast
                            their behavior from the brand image when primed with an
                            anthropomorphized brand compared to a nonanthropomorphized
                        brand.</p>
               </statement>
            </p>
                <p>In what follows, we report three studies examining these hypotheses. The first
                    two studies use people’s naturally occurring sense of the role assigned to
                    actual brands, and we assess the role associated with the specific chosen brands
                    using pretests. Study 1 tests hypothesis 1 by examining the effects of brands
                    seen in a partner role, while study 2 tests hypothesis 2 by examining the
                    effects of brands seen in a servant role. In both studies, the key comparison is
                    between consumers’ behavior when primed with a brand that is
                    anthropomorphized versus primed with a brand that is seen as an object. Support
                    for our hypotheses would be revealed in an interaction between conception of the
                    brand (anthropomorphized or not) and liking, with moderation by liking observed
                    only when the brand is seen as human. Finally, study 3 goes beyond measuring the
                    brand’s naturally perceived role, as was done in studies 1 and 2, by
                    contextually manipulating the partner and servant roles within a single brand
                    context. This study thus helps us get further support for the proposed theory by
                    making direct comparisons between partner and servant roles within the same
                    study.</p>

            <title>Study 1: Healthy and Unhealthy Partner Brands</title>
            <p>Our first study examines two partner brands, Krispy Kreme and Kellogg’s, chosen
                because the key associations with them were the opposite of one another.
                Assimilation to the Krispy Kreme prime would mean acting unhealthily, while
                assimilation to the Kellogg’s prime would mean acting healthily. Hence, we
                could use the same dependent variable (a measure of healthfulness or unhealthy
                indulgence) with the two brands standing as conceptual replicates but with results
                expected to reverse across the two brands.</p>
            <p>The selection of these brands and those for study 2, which focused on servant brands,
                was based on the results of a pretest conducted among a group of 104 undergraduate
                students at the University of Toronto. Participants in this pretest were shown one
                of two sets of 50 brand names each, such that half the participants saw one set of
                50 brand names, and the other half saw a different set of 50 brand names.
                Participants were asked to indicate the first two words/associations that came to
                mind as they read each of the 50 brands. Across the 52 participants, a total of 104
                associations for each of the brand names were generated. We restricted selection of
                brands for our studies to those with a single dominant association; over 50% to one
                association and no other association (other than product category or price mentions)
                greater than 10%.</p>
            <p>We also conducted pretests with separate groups of participants from the same
                university to assess the extent to which the two brands were seen in a partnership
                role (like a partner, works with the consumer, coproduces) and a servant role (like
                a servant, an assistant, like an outsource), using 1–7 scales. Pair-wise
                comparisons showed that participants were more likely to see these brands as
                partners versus servants (for Krispy Kreme: 4.35 vs. 3.94; <italic>t</italic>(1, 40)
                = 3,13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; for Kellogg’s: 4.87 vs. 4.22;

                <title>Design, Stimuli, and Procedure</title>
                <p>Seventy-three students from the University of Toronto who participated for course
                    credit answered questions about Krispy Kreme (study 1A) and 70 students answered
                    questions about Kellogg’s (study 1B). Participants in these studies were
                    told that they would be responding to a variety of short studies being conducted
                    by different researchers and, indeed, the materials presented participants
                    related to several unrelated experiments. Both studies 1A and 1B used a
                    two-factor design with brand conception (anthropomorphism, object) being
                    manipulated and likeability being measured as the between-participants
                    factors.</p>
                <p>For the first of the studies related to the present research, participants were
                    told that the researcher was interested in finding out how people think about
                    different brands and products. In the anthropomorphism condition, participants
                    were encouraged to imagine that the brand had come to life as a person and to
                    think of the sort of person the brand would be in terms of its personality,
                    physical appearance, opinions, approach, profession, conversational style, and
                    so forth. In the object condition, the participants were instructed to describe
                    the brand in as much detail as possible and were encouraged to think of all the
                    features, benefits, characteristics, and different aspects of the brand they may
                    have heard about. The participants had up to two pages of space to write their
                    open-ended responses. To ensure that this manipulation did not lead to any
                    differences in engagement with the task or degree of elaboration, a comparison
                    of the word count across the two conditions showed no differences either for
                    Krispy Kreme (<italic>M</italic>

                    1, <italic>p</italic> = NS).</p>
                <p>Next, the participants were asked to respond to a short scenario purportedly
                    designed by another researcher to study decision-making skills of university
                    students when facing everyday issues. The scenario asked them to imagine that
                    “you are going for a class and that there is a bit of a lineup for the
                    elevator. It has been a long day and you are feeling somewhat tired. The stairs
                    to the third floor were close at hand.” They were asked to respond on a
                    7-point scale on their likelihood of waiting for the elevator (1) or taking the
                    stairs (7). This question was the dependent variable for our main study. It was
                    hypothesized that, in keeping with hypothesis 1, participants who
                    anthropomorphized the Krispy Kreme brand would behave in an assimilative manner
                    and show a lower likelihood to take the stairs (less healthy behavior) if they
                    liked the brand and behave in a contrastive manner by showing a greater
                    likelihood to take the stairs (healthy behavior) if they disliked the brand. In
                    the same way, participants who anthropomorphized the Kellogg’s brand would
                    behave in an assimilative manner by displaying a greater likelihood to take the
                    stairs if they liked the brand (more healthy behavior) but behaving in a
                    contrastive manner by displaying a lower likelihood to take the stairs (less
                    healthy behavior) if they disliked the brand. Thus, while the participants
                    exposed to the Krispy Kreme and Kellogg’s brands are predicted to behave
                    in completely opposite ways because the two brands are on the opposing ends of
                    the healthy-trait spectrum, these expected results would in fact provide
                    conceptual replication of the effect.</p>
                <p>Following this question, the participants were asked to think back to Krispy
                    Kreme (or Kellogg’s) and to rate their liking for the brand. Three
                    questions (like the brand, admire, fit in your life) were combined into a single
                    “liking” measure (α<sub>Krispy Kreme</sub> = .82;
                        α<sub>Kellogg’s</sub> = .72). Next, a number of other unrelated
                    studies were administered, after which a few demographic measures were taken.
                    Finally, the participants were debriefed and thanked for their
                    participation.</p>

                <title>Results</title>
                <p>Data were analyzed separately for the two brands and will be reported as such as
                    studies 1A and 1B. Since our measure of liking was taken subsequent to the brand
                    conception manipulation, it was important to assess if there were any
                    significant differences in brand liking due to brand conception. An ANOVA
                    conducted across the brand conception conditions with brand liking as the
                    dependent variable showed that brand liking was no different across the
                    anthropomorphism and object condition for Krispy Kreme

                    <p>To test hypothesis 1, a regression analysis was first run with a dummy
                        variable for brand conception (anthropomorphism = 1, object = 0), the
                        continuous brand liking measure, and the interaction of the two as the three
                        independent variables. The likelihood to take the stairs was included in the
                        regression as the dependent variable. Results show that there was a
                        significant effect of brand conception (β = .61, <italic>t</italic>(1,
                        69) = 2.12, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and a nonsignificant effect of

                        interaction, further analysis was conducted at one and a half standard
                        deviations above and below the mean of liking, as suggested by prior
                        research (Aiken and West 1991;
                        Fitzsimons 2008). Results show that
                        at higher levels of liking (1.5 SD above the mean) participants in the
                        anthropomorphism condition were less likely to take the stairs than those in

                        of 87 participants were administered the dependent variable as a control.
                        This set of participants, which was drawn from the same participant pool as
                        those in our main study and recruited in the same fashion, was just shown

                        or anthropomorphism manipulation. Regression analyses were conducted
                        comparing the anthropomorphism and control conditions. Results show that
                        there was a significant interaction effect of brand conception and liking
                        (β = −.59, <italic>t</italic>(1, 120) = −2.28,

                        at one and a half standard deviations above and below the mean of liking.
                        Results show that at higher levels of liking (1.5 SD above the mean), the
                        difference between the anthropomorphism and control conditions is marginally
                        significant (<italic>M</italic>

                        (1.5 SD below the mean), the difference between the anthropomorphism and

                    <p>Finally, a comparison of the object and control conditions was conducted to
                        examine the extent to which seeing the brand as an object resulted in
                        significant differences in the participants’ likelihood to assimilate
                        or contrast with the default level of associated brand trait. A regression
                        analysis showed that there was no significant interaction effect of brand
                        conception and liking (β = .13, <italic>t</italic>(1, 119) = .58,
                            <italic>p</italic> &gt; .50) nor any significant main effects of either
                        brand conception (β = −.06, <italic>t</italic>(1, 119) = 58,
                            <italic>p</italic> &gt; .50) or of liking (β = .02,
                        <italic>t</italic>(1, 119) = .21, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .80).</p>
                    <p>This last set of results, which reveals that the object and control
                        conditions do not differ significantly, provides a way for us to simplify
                        the presentation of results going forward. The results of the comparison for
                        the object and control conditions for all subsequent studies also showed no
                        significant differences across the two groups. As a consequence, we are able
                        to use the object condition as a control condition to indicate assimilation
                        or contrast of the brand association, holding constant possible differences
                        in default tendencies for the target behavior depending on brand liking. For
                        reasons of brevity, therefore, for all subsequent studies, we will report
                        detailed results for the comparison between the anthropomorphism and object
                        conditions and only report abbreviated results for the other comparisons
                        (i.e., between anthropomorphism and control conditions and between object
                        and control conditions).</p>

                        and a nonsignificant effect of liking (β = −.23,
                            <italic>t</italic>(1, 64) = −1.13, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .20). More
                        importantly, there was a significant interaction of brand conception and
                        liking (β = 1.59, <italic>t</italic>(1, 64) = 2.21, <italic>p</italic>
                        &lt; .05). Further analysis was conducted at one and a half standard
                        deviations above and below the mean of liking. Results show that at higher
                        levels of liking (1.5 SD above the mean), consistent with assimilation,
                        participants were more likely to take the stairs in the anthropomorphism
                        than in the object condition, although this effect was only marginally

                        was a significant interaction effect of brand conception and liking (β

                        and the control groups showed that there were no significant main effects of
                        liking (β = −.09, <italic>t</italic>(1, 206) = −1.18,

                <title>Discussion</title>
                <p>Results of studies 1A and 1B support hypothesis 1. When the two partner brands
                    were anthropomorphized, liking moderated the effect of the brand prime. Behavior
                    of the participants assimilated to the brand prime when they liked the brand but
                    contrasted from it when they disliked the brand. In these studies, we used two
                    different brands with opposing trait associations, a pattern that allows us to
                    rule out generic effects for being asked to anthropomorphize the brand on
                    tendency to behave in a healthy or energetic way. In particular, assimilation
                    for an anthropomorphized Kellogg’s in the liking condition was reflected
                    by greater inclination to take the stairs but assimilation for an
                    anthropomorphized Krispy Kreme in the liking condition was reflected in greater
                    tendency to wait for the elevator. As expected, our results also find that
                    participants who do not anthropomorphize the brand, but instead think of it as
                    an object, do not show any effect of liking or disliking for the brand in their
                    subsequent behavior. For both Krispy Kreme and Kellogg’s brands, there is
                    no significant difference in the behavior of participants in the object
                    condition compared to those in the control condition.</p>
                <p>One key premise of the Cesario et al. (2006) framework is that the behavioral responses are determined by
                    what is deemed to be the most effective way to interact with a member of the
                    primed category. In study 1, the two brands—Krispy Kreme and
                    Kellogg’s—were selected such that they were both perceived as
                    partners to the consumer, and we observed an assimilative behavior from
                    consumers when primed with a brand they anthropomorphized and liked. As noted in
                    hypothesis 2, we expect the opposite effect of the anthropomorphized brand prime
                    if the brand is seen as a servant, specifically, contrasting the association
                    when the brand is liked and assimilating it when the brand is disliked.</p>

            <title>Study 2: Safe and Knowledgeable Servant Brands</title>
            <p>We again used two brands to test our predictions, drawn from our pretest of trait
                associations described above. Study 2A focused on the Discovery Channel, which is
                associated with knowledge and study 2B focused on Volvo, which is associated with
                safety. Although these two brands have distinct traits associated with them, and
                consequently do not span the opposite ends of one particular trait as was the case
                in study 1, the advantage of having two brands from very different categories
                (entertainment, automobiles) and with very different associated traits (knowledge,
                safety) is that they would provide a useful replication of the predicted effect in
                vastly different contexts and using different dependent variables.</p>
            <p>Our intuition was that these brands would be perceived as servants instead of
                partners. Volvo keeps the customer safe regardless of the customer’s actions.
                The Discovery Channel is a source of knowledge, providing this helpful service to
                its viewers “like Merlin serving King Arthur,” in the words of one
                student to whom we described this work. These intuitions were confirmed in a
                pretest, like one described for study 1, assessing the extent to which the two
                brands were seen in a servant role (like a servant, works for the consumer, work
                delegated) and a partner role (like a partner, colleague, friend), using 1–7
                scales. Pair-wise comparisons showed that participants’ mean ratings were
                higher for the brand in a servant role than in a partner role for Discovery Channel
                (5.47 vs. 4.82; <italic>t</italic>(1, 44) = 3.59, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and
                for Volvo (4.88 vs. 4.48; <italic>t</italic>(1, 46) = 2.26, <italic>p</italic> &lt;
                .05).</p>

                <title>Design, Stimuli, and Procedure</title>
                <p>One hundred and sixty-four students from the same university as study 1
                    participated in study 2A, involving the Discovery Channel, and 188 students
                    participated in study 2B, involving Volvo. Both studies used brand conception
                    (anthropomorphism, object) and likeability as the two between-participant
                    factors, of which brand conception was manipulated and likeability was measured,
                    as in study 1. As before, to ensure that the anthropomorphism manipulation did
                    not lead to any differences in elaboration, a comparison of the word count
                    across the two conditions showed no differences either for Discovery Channel

                <p>Next, the participants responded to the main dependent variable, which was
                    presented as an unrelated study being run by a different researcher, and, as
                    noted above, these measures differed for the two brands. As a measure of
                    assimilation or contrast with the association to knowledge, participants who
                    were exposed to the Discovery brand name gave their responses to 15 questions
                    selected from a set of sample SAT (Reasoning Test, formerly called the
                    Standardized Admission Test) questions testing mathematical and verbal
                    abilities. As a measure of assimilation or contrast to safety, participants who
                    were exposed to the Volvo brand were presented with a gambling scenario that
                    gave them a one in 1,000 chance to win $2,000, and they were asked to indicate
                    if they would choose the gamble or the sure amount—with a total of 17
                    levels of sure amounts sequentially increasing from $1.00 to $160.00. The level
                    first marked by the participants as the sure amount at which they would switch
                    from the gamble was deemed as their certainty equivalence for the gamble, and it
                    was the dependent variable for study 2B.</p>
                <p>Following this task, the participants were asked to think back to Discovery
                    Channel (or Volvo) and to respond to the same set of three questions about their
                    liking for the brand (like the brand, admire, fit in your life) as asked in
                    study 1, along with two additional questions (embarrassing to be seen with
                    [reversed], avoid being with [reversed]), all of which were combined into a
                    single “liking” measure (α<sub>Discovery</sub> = .83 and
                        α<sub>Volvo</sub> = 0.82). Participants then responded to several
                    unrelated studies, provided demographic information, and were thanked and
                    debriefed.</p>

                <p>As before, to assess if there were any significant differences in brand liking
                    due to brand conception, an ANOVA was conducted across the brand conception
                    conditions with brand liking as the dependent variable. Results showed that
                    brand liking was no different across the anthropomorphism and object condition

                    conception on liking for Volvo was rather unexpected, the results are not
                    necessarily problematic for our proposed theory since this effect seems to be an
                    anomaly. In particular, as we will observe later in study 3, there was no effect
                    of brand conception on brand liking for the Volvo brand.</p>

                    <p>In this study, lower certainty equivalence corresponds to assimilation to the

                <title>Discussion</title>
                <p>The results of studies 2A and 2B show that for servant brands such as Discovery
                    Channel and Volvo anthropomorphism leads to greater assimilation if participants
                    dislike the brand than if they like it. This is an interesting, predicted
                    reversal of the effect observed in study 1 in keeping with the different
                    perceived role of the brands in study 2. By assimilating their behavior to the
                    brand’s image, consumers obviate any need for the servant brand to take
                    care of the task on their behalf—an effective social ploy to get rid of a
                    disliked brand-person. With no clear purpose, the disliked, anthropomorphized
                    brand would presumably slink off. However, when the servant is liked, consumers
                    contrast the behavior associated with the brand, signaling a strong need on that
                    dimension, which should serve as an effective ploy to draw in the humanized
                    entity. The effect is much the same as the clichéd ploy of
                    “snaring” a love interest by feigning ignorance on a particular
                    strength of the desired person.</p>
                <p>This reversal of the effect of liking within the anthropomorphism condition
                    across the partner and servant role—assimilation for liked partners but
                    contrast for liked servants—is not only consistent with our account based
                    on motivated preparation to interact but also serves to rule out alternative
                    explanations based on differences in processing for the anthropomorphism and
                    object conditions. That is, looking at either study 1 or 2 in isolation, the
                    divergence in effects between the anthropomorphism and object conditions might
                    be attributed to greater elaboration, vividness, or other processing differences
                    produced by the anthropomorphism instructions. According to such accounts, the
                    anthropomorphism instructions simply lead to some sort of greater engagement
                    with the task, which allows liking to produce an effect, compared to the bland
                    object condition. However, these accounts fail to predict the reversal of the
                    effect for liking, considering just the anthropomorphism condition, for partner
                    brands in study 1 compared to servant brands in study 2. In particular, we know
                    of no account other than the one we propose that would predict a reversal of the
                    effect of liking depending on brand role.</p>
                <p>This argument, however, requires us to look across studies and across brands. We
                    therefore thought it important to directly examine the moderating effect of role
                    and likeability in a study within the context of one brand. Consequently, study
                    3 was designed to directly examine the extent to which the effects will be
                    replicated for the same brand that is manipulated to be seen as a servant and a
                    partner. Thus, under the guise of a pretest of an advertising slogan for Volvo,
                    study 3 manipulates the brand’s role of being a partner or a servant to
                    the consumer by exposing the consumers to one of two alternative slogans:
                    “Volvo. Works with You” or “Volvo. Works for You.” It is
                    expected that when consumers are told the brand works with you, they would see
                    it as a partner, leading to assimilation of the brand association when they like
                    it. By contrast, we expected that when consumers are told the brand works for
                    you, they would think of it as a servant, and so be more likely to assimilate
                    the association if they dislike the brand.</p>

                <p>One hundred and ninety-four students from the same university as in studies 1 and
                    2 participated in this study and were provided the same general instructions.
                    The study was a three-factor design, with brand conception (anthropomorphism,
                    object), brand role (partner, servant), and likeability as the
                    between-participants factors, of which brand conception and role were
                    manipulated factors and likeability was a measured variable. Participants first
                    encountered the anthropomorphism manipulation. As in the prior two studies,
                    analysis of the number of words written revealed no difference in elaboration
                    across the anthropomorphism and object conditions
                        (<italic>M</italic>

                    1.79, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .10).</p>
                <p>Next, participants were exposed to the manipulation of brand role under the
                    pretext of a pretest being done for a new advertising tagline for Volvo. In the
                    “partner” condition, the tagline was: “Volvo. Works with You.
                    Helping You Take Care of What’s Important,” while in the
                    “servant” condition, the tagline was: “‘Volvo. Works for
                    You. Taking Care of What’s Important to You.” Participants then
                    responded to a set of 10 items assessing their comprehension and evaluation of
                    the slogan (which were all unrelated to the primary hypotheses of interest).</p>
                <p>Subsequent to these questions, the participants responded to the certainty
                    equivalence question like that used in study 2B, which served as the main
                    dependent variable. Again, higher certainty equivalence was indicative of
                    greater risk taking, and so higher scores would reflect contrast from the brand
                    association with safety. Finally, participants responded to the same set of five
                    questions assessing their likeability (α = .83) for the Volvo brand as
                    used in study 2B (like, admire, fit in, embarrassing to be seen with [reversed],
                    avoid being with [reversed]). As before, an analysis revealed that perceptions
                    of brand liking did not differ across either the two brand conception conditions

                    showed that the interaction effect of brand conception and liking is significant
                    when the brand was seen as a partner (β = −.78, <italic>t</italic>(1,

                    if they dislike the brand. By contrast, those who anthropomorphize Volvo as a

                    displaying greater risk taking if they like the brand relative to if they

                <p>As before, a separate control group was run with a different but comparable set
                    of 171 undergraduate students. Since the brand role manipulation was not
                    administered on this control group, separate analyses were conducted for the two
                    brand role conditions. For the brand as partner, regression revealed a
                    marginally significant interaction of brand conception and likeability (β =
                    .41, <italic>t</italic>(1, 211) = 1.72, <italic>p</italic> = .087), with
                    participants who liked Volvo being marginally more likely to show a lower
                    certainty equivalence compared to the control, with those who disliked Volvo
                    being no different across the anthropomorphism or control conditions. For the
                    brand presented as servant, regression showed a significant interaction effect
                    of brand conception and liking (β = −.56, <italic>t</italic>(1, 209)
                    = −2.08, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), with participants who liked the
                    brand seeking a significantly greater certainty equivalent amount in the
                    anthropomorphism compared to the control condition but being no different across
                    the two conditions if they disliked the brand. Finally, as expected, analysis of
                    the object and control conditions shows no significant effects

                <title>Theoretical Implications of This Research</title>
                <p>Results of our third study, like those of studies 1 and 2, provide evidence
                    consistent with our theorizing that automatic behavior in response to a brand
                    prime depends on whether or not it is anthropomorphized. For brands that are
                    anthropomorphized, the priming effects follow the pattern suggested by a
                    motivated preparation to interact, as detailed by Cesario et al. (2006). Our participants adopted the
                    behavior best suited to an effective interaction, assimilating the behavior to
                    the image of a partner brand that is liked, thereby signaling a willingness to
                    team up; and contrasting a partner brand they disliked, signaling a wish that
                    the brand should go away. When the brand was perceived as a servant, the pattern
                    reversed. Participants contrasted the association of a liked servant, which
                    signaled a strong need for the anthropomorphized brand and so a desire to draw
                    the brand-person closer, whereas they assimilated the association of a disliked
                    servant, thereby signaling to the brand-person “back off, you are not
                    needed here.” We observed no effect of prime when the brand was not
                    anthropomorphized.</p>
                <p>Our findings not only support our theorizing but also rule out possible
                    alternative explanations based on processing differences between the
                    anthropomorphism and object conditions. For example, one could argue that the
                    anthropomorphism instructions increased the degree of elaboration or involvement
                    in the task, thereby fostering an effect for liking that was lacking in the
                    object conditions. Our measure of elaboration, number of words written about the
                    brand in each condition, is not consistent with these accounts. More
                    importantly, an explanation based on processing differences caused by the
                    anthropomorphism instructions cannot explain the reversal of the effect of
                    liking across brand role within the anthropomorphism conditions observed across
                    studies 1 and 2 and in study 3.</p>
                <p>One might also argue that the anthropomorphism instructions led to a more vivid
                    representation of the brand in the minds of participants. This account is more
                    challenging to dismiss outright because vividness, at least in one sense, and
                    anthropomorphism are conceptually linked. The word “vivid” is
                    derived from a Latin root “vividus” meaning alive and lively and,
                    indeed, one definition of vivid is “full of life; lively; animated”
                        (<italic>Random House Dictionary of the English Language</italic>). In this
                    sense, our anthropomorphism instructions also call for a more vivid
                    representation. However, vivid may also be taken to mean “strikingly
                    bright or intense, as color, light, etc.,” which is not strictly aligned
                    with bringing the brand to life. In addition, research on vividness in consumer
                    behavior has largely followed the characterization provided by Nisbett and Ross
                        (1980, 45): “Information may
                    be described as vivid, that is likely to attract and hold our attention and to
                    excite the imagination to the extent that is (<italic>a</italic>) emotionally
                    interesting, (<italic>b</italic>) concrete and imagery provoking, and
                        (<italic>c</italic>) proximate in a sensory, temporal, and spatial
                    way” (e.g., Keller and Block 1997;
                    Kisielius and Sternthal 1986; McGill and
                    Anand 1989), a very broad definition
                    that may be tied to affect, imagery, elaboration, even construal level, along
                    with anthropomorphism.</p>
                <p>An examination of the descriptions our participants provided for the brands also
                    reveals the challenge in distinguishing the sense of vividness as being alive
                    from other senses of the construct. For example, “[the brand] would walk
                    like a geek” suggests animation as well as concrete, imagery-provoking
                    terms. For this reason, we cannot fully rule out vividness, broadly defined, as
                    an explanation for our findings, which would therefore be recast as “vivid
                    representations of a liked partner brand lead to assimilation whereas vivid
                    representations of liked servant brands lead to contrast.” However, we
                    believe the perception of the brand as coming alive as a person has the most
                    conceptual support. As we argued, seeing the brand as a person triggers a
                    motivated preparation to interact and the different motivations for a successful
                    interaction with a partner and a servant produces the reversal of effects across
                    roles. By contrast, we know of no conceptual support for the reversal of effects
                    for partner and servant brands depending on vividness in any other sense of the
                    construct.</p>
                <p>We also considered the possibility that our liking variable, because it was
                    measured, led to selection effects with participants who liked the brand being
                    more likely to produce the behavior regardless of the prime. This explanation
                    also cannot account for the reversal of the liking effect in the partner and
                    servant conditions in study 3, which focused on one brand. To further assess
                    this alternative explanation, we also ran a control condition for each study
                    consisting of participants who responded to the main dependent
                    variable—for example, indicating whether they would take the stairs or
                    not, stating their certainty equivalence for a gamble, and responding to SAT
                    questions—and who also indicated how much they liked the target brand. In
                    all cases, the pattern of results in the control condition did not differ
                    significantly from that of the object condition. We accordingly relied on the
                    object condition as a control for the effect of liking. Specifically, we
                    compared the responses when people greatly liked the brand (1.5 SD above the
                    mean of liking) in the anthropomorphism and object conditions and when they
                    greatly disliked the brand (1.5 SD below the mean of liking). This comparison
                    produced 12 “contrast” tests, six involving partner brands
                    (Kellogg’s, Krispy Kreme, and Volvo<sub>study3/partner/manipulated</sub>)
                    and six involving servant brands (Discovery Channel,
                        Volvo<sub>study2/measured</sub>, and
                        Volvo<sub>study3/servant/manipulated</sub>), 11 of which were significant or
                    marginally so, while the remaining test was in the predicted direction.</p>
                <p>As noted in the introduction, the purpose of the role variable in our studies was
                    to test our theory regarding the mechanism producing brand priming effects. In
                    particular, we expected the effect of liking to reverse for anthropomorphized
                    brands for partner and servant brands because the best way to interact with such
                    brands differed. We should note that support for the effect of this variable was
                    provided by just four brands, two of which pretests indicated were perceived as
                    partners (Kellogg’s and Krispy Kreme) and two of which were perceived as
                    servants (Volvo and Discovery Channel). We were also able to manipulate the
                    perception of one of these brands, Volvo, as a partner or a servant through an
                    advertising tag line. Hence, while the pattern of results in our studies is
                    consistent with our theorizing, we acknowledge that the evidence regarding the
                    effect of this variable is fairly limited. This acknowledgement is important
                    because the conception of brands as partners and servants is interesting in its
                    own right and might, in time, provide a useful contribution to the brand
                    relationship literature, going far beyond our theoretical account. However, much
                    future work is needed to validate the relevance and operation of this
                    distinction. To the extent that this distinction appears valid, future studies
                    might find it informative to examine if there is a particular pattern in what
                    types or categories of brands are deemed to be partners and what types or
                    categories are seen more like servants, or whether it all depends on the
                    marketers’ positioning efforts with respect to the specific brand.</p>
                <p>We had been uncertain about the possible effects in the object condition, but our
                    findings are quite consistent across the studies. We saw no moderation by liking
                    or role. Neither did we observe a main effect of brand prime compared to
                    controls. Hence, we did not find evidence in favor of the perception-behavior
                    link as suggested by Bargh et al. (1996)
                    for any of the brands. Of course, this null effect does not rule out possible
                    priming effect for objectified brands. Because the focus of our investigation
                    was on understanding behavioral differences when the brand is anthropomorphized,
                    we did not pursue possible moderators within the object condition. However,
                    given the interesting findings from recent research suggesting different effects
                    of brands on consumers’ self perception depending on their prior beliefs
                    about personality (Park and Roedder John 2010), there is opportunity for future researchers to explore
                    potential moderators of the behavioral effects of brand priming when the brand
                    is perceived as an object.</p>
                <p>As they presently stand, however, our findings already provide some insights for
                    marketing managers. First, our data suggest that not all brands are
                    automatically anthropomorphized. Second, brands may have a stronger effect on
                    consumer behavior when they are anthropomorphized, and these effects may follow
                    a complex pattern. Finally, the specific relationships that consumers develop
                    with a brand uniquely influence the subsequent behavioral effects. Specifically,
                    whether or not the consumer assimilates or contrasts the behavior associated
                    with the brand image may depend on liking, brand role, and, possibly any other
                    factor that would influence a perceived successful social interaction. For
                    managers, merely anthropomorphizing the brand may not necessarily produce the
                    kind of behavioral effects they expect if the precise role that consumers assign
                    to this humanized brand is not fully understood.</p>

                <title>Relationship to Prior Research and Possible Future Investigations</title>
                <p>Our research is based on prior findings reported by Cesario et al. (2006) that demonstrate the role of
                    motivation to interact effectively as the underlying process that determines
                    people’s subsequent behavioral response. As noted in the introduction,
                    research by Fitzsimons et al. (2008)
                    also highlights the importance of goals in a brand context. However, the
                    motivational process proposed by these researchers is somewhat different. The
                    model proposed by Fitzsimons et al. (2008) is based on the consumers’ goal to take on desired
                    characteristics, such as creativity or honesty, which are strongly associated
                    with the brand. However, Cesario et al. (2006) suggest that priming effects are driven not by the desire to
                    possess given characteristics but instead by the desire to achieve successful
                    social interactions. These two lines of research may be aligned by noting that
                    the most effective way to interact with an admired brand possessing a desired
                    image may be to assimilate one’s behavior to that image.</p>
                <p>Our research shows that anthropomorphized brands may influence consumer behavior
                    outside the brand context, affecting decisions about fitness, risk taking, and
                    performance on an examination. These are striking effects, and they warrant
                    further study. For example, how long do these effects last? How soon after being
                    exposed to the brand does the behavior have to be enacted for consumers to
                    exhibit this effect? Are these effects stronger for consumers who see themselves
                    as loyal consumers compared to those who are not, or those who identify with the
                    brand versus those who do not? Russell Belk (1988) helped the field to understand how consumers extend themselves
                    through their possessions. Providing answers to these and related question may
                    reveal the reverse, how possessions are extended through consumers.</p>
