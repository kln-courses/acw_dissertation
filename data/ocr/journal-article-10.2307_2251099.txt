<plain_text><page sequence="1">VI.ACRITICAL NOTICES God and Nature. By G. F. STOUT. Cambridge University Press, 1952. Pp. liv + 339. 35s. THIS book is prefaced by a memoir of Stout by Professor J. A. Passmore. It gives an effective summary of Stout's development and of his main philosophical views and it completes the previously published memoirs by Broad and Mace with an attractive portrayal of him in his last five years, spent in Australia. The Bibliography annexed to the Memoir is a reminder of the energy which enabled Stout to produce this impressive series of books and papers, along- side his teaching and the exacting task of editing MIND for thirty years (1891-1920). Stout's previous book Mind and Matter (1931) was described as 'the first of two volumes based on the Gifford Lectures of 1919 and *1921 '. The present work is the second, but it is not in any ordin- ary sense Vol. II. It includes the whole of the two Gifford courses with the exception of the four lectures on Materialism with which Mind and Matter has dealt more adequately. It therefore overlaps the other parts of Mind and Matter; and it requires only the addi- tion of the refutation of Materialism from the earlier work to make it a complete piece of argument covering Stout's whole epistemo- logical theory. It has been edited with due care and attention by the author's son, Professor A. K. Stout, from a full manuscript to which the author could never be persuaded to return. Other Gif- ford lecturers have been known to find it difficult to fulfil the -requirement that their lectures should be published. But a thirty year interval must constitute a record. Besides overlapping Mind and Matter the present volume includes versions of all Stout's philosophical (as distinct from his psycho- logical) views. Most of these are already known to philosophers from the papers printed in Studies in Philosophy and Psychology (1930). What is found in God and Nature and nowhere else in Stout's work is a group of arguments lending support to the two 'basic presuppositions of the religious consciousness', that 'the universe is a unity in such a sense that we are justified in attempt- ing to determine its nature as a whole, and in taking up a certain emotional and practical attitude towards it as a whole' and that ' mind is not merely something transient and incidental, but is primary and ultimate in the constitution of the universe' (p. 22). I shall call these arguments Stout's 'theistic arguments'. And, since his other views are already well-known, I shall emphasize and treat more fully these theistic arguments. But it is impossible to isolate them from their setting, and indeed all of them grow out from theories of Stout's, which his readers have met before, and 523</page><page sequence="2">524 CRITICAL NOTICES: which will therefore require brief mention at each point. Studies in Philosophy and Psychology and Mind and Matter were both given full and critical reviews by Professor Broad -in MIND (April 1931 and July 1932); and Stout's views on perception, universals, probability, and truth have been discussed by other writers; I shall accordingly restrict my comments to the theistic arguments and to any other topics which, so, far as I know,'first appear hiere or have not been elsewhere discussed by other writers. I shall enclose my comments in square brackets so that 'they need not interrupt the continuity of Stout's own argument. The first book defines the relation of philosophy to religion and -defends metaphysics against agnosticism. Philosophy must accord the claims -of religious experience a critical attention. It can show that they are not necessarily invalid, and it may.find a- guments which tend to support them. Neither Spencerian nor scholastic agnosticism is a reasonable alternative. Spencer held that we can know that the universe exists but nothing about it; but if we have grounds for asserting its existence we have grounds (the same grounds) for inferring its.nature. The scholastic'view that we can know God only as we are related to him, and -not as he is nor as he is related to us, is rejected because 'we cannot know how B -is related to A without pro tanto knowing how A is related to B'. [This seems doubtful. It is true in such cases as ' B is north of A' or ' B is greater than A ' but if B loves A nothing follows about how A is related to B.]-- Book II defends the unity of the universe against pluralism such as Russell's (in Problems of Philosophy). Stout also rejects the absolutism of Hegel which overstates the logical intelligibility of the universe in claiming that the truth about the whole is deducible from the nature of a single part, and of Bradley and Bosanquet who reduce the world as we know it in space and time to unreality. From this criticism, Stout's first theistic argument emerges. The series of temporal events is infinite. Stout accepts Russell's as- surance that there is nothing self-contradictory about infinite collections, but he argues that no infinite series can be self-complete and self-contained. 'Change and succession therefore presuppose an Eternal Being without which they are incapable of existing' (p. 51). [There is nothing further in the text or in Mind and Matter to explain or defend this sudden bold inference. It is made par- ticularly difficult by Stout's insistence implied here and fully stated later (Chapter XIV) that the world of change and succession is real and not appearance; and that the Eternal Mind is distinct from it. How something essentially incomplete can retain 'its reality as part of the whole universe, and how the postulation of another reality of a completely different type will serve to complete it-these questions remain to puzzle the reader. If we move in this direction at all and demand self-completeness for reality, it would-seem more plausible to end with a yiew such as that of</page><page sequence="3">J. D. MABBOTT: God and Nature 525 Bradley or McTaggart that. time and change are unreal. There is the further assumption, also -undefended, that the self-complete being so postulated to remedy the incompleteness of the world of change is a Mind. But is there anything essentially self-complete about a mind ? The minds we know most about (our own) are essentially incomplete too. And is the Eternal Mind self-complete and self-contained without the world of change or only taken along with it? The rejection of, temporal creation, which immediately follows (p. 51)-though in a passage marked by Stout as in need of rewriting-makes these problems even more intractable.] Book II continues (Chapter IV) with a criticism of Russell's pluralism which Stout regards as based wholly on his distinction between knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description. To know about x we must have prior knowledge of x. - Description involves relations and universals. Acquaintance is with particulars. It is inexpressible and neither true nor false. These particulars, thus directly known, free from all relations, constitute Russell's pluralistic universe. Stout attacks this epistemology effectively (and of course Russell himself later modified it). There is no reason to suppose that the x we know by acquaintance is self- complete, for this presupposes without justification that we know its whole nature by acquaintance. From the fact that a relation is not part of a thing we cannot conclude that this thing could exist not so related. (Relation to the inside of something is not part of the surface, but the surface could not exist without the inside.) Knowledge by acquaintance, as Russell defines it, cannot be know- ledge at all; for there can be no knowledge where nothing is known about the object and where there is no truth. Stout's own view about acquaintance (or direct awareness) is -that it differs from indirect awareness not in the nature of what is known but in the kind of evidence we have. The same fact (e.g. that.:Jones has toothache) can be known directly by Jones and indirectly by some- one else or by Jones himself at another time. Stout thinks that the same dangerous distinction between knowing x and knowing about x led Loeke to his puzzles about substance. The only solu- tion for the difficulties both of Locke and of Russell is to maintain that all knowledge of x is knowledge about x; and consequently that ' x itself' is simply the group of its intrinsic characteristics united in a special form of unity. Biut this meons all its charac- teristics. The problem then arises how we can claim to have direct awareness of x when we certainly do not know directly all the characteristics of x. It was Russell's awareness of this problem which drove him to his views that the particulars we know by acquaintance are self-complete and are fully known by acquain- tance. Such knowledge, he,14eld, cannot include any knowledge of relations between characteristics which are immediately experienced and those that are not. Stout maintains on the contrary-and he rightly says this is a vital principle in all his arguments-that we</page><page sequence="4">526 CRITICAL NOTICES: can know a whole without knowing all its parts severally, that what we know directly is known in that very experience to be partial and incomplete, that in knowing some characteristics of x directly we know something about x as a whole, and that in know- ing x as a whole we know something about the wider whole to which x belongs. In memory, for example, we have an immediate experience which points beyond itself to the past. The past is"not immediately known, nor is it inferred. (This crucial point recurs and is more fully illustrated later, as I note below.) Book II closes (Chapter V) with an account of universals and particulars and of- possibility and necessity, subjects on which Stout's views are already known to philosophers from Papers XIII, XV, XVI and XVII in Studies in Philosophy and Psychology. Embedded in this chapter, however, is a section (pp. 81-82) which is'vital to his theistic conclusions. It repeats and takes further the argument of Paper VII in Studies. Each sensum is known as essentially incomplete and as continued beyond itself into a whole which transcends and includes it. 'This whole is apprehended as one and the same for all data'. Stout's theory of perception had included all along the view that a physical object is known in and through the sensing of a single sensum. But here it is asserted that a sensum points beyond itself not only to a phvsical object but beyond that to a single whole which is the same for all sensa. [Again there is no explanation or defence of this vital step. But presumably the suppressed argument is that the physical object to which the incomplete sensum points is in its turn incomplete and points beyond itself to a wider world of space, time, and causality; and-nothing short of the whole spatio-temporal order can remedy this incompleteness; and then the spatio-temporal world is itself incomplete and requires (see the first theistic argument above) the postulation of an Eternal Mind.] Stout considers the alternative view of Russell and others that sensa are directly known; but that physical objects (whether taken as entities of a different type from sensa or as groups of actual and possible sensa) are inductively inferred and therefore are matters of belief, not knowledge. He rejects this on the basis of general considerations about possibility. The Inductive Principle cannot carry the weight it must in any theory such as Russell's. Possi- bility and probability must rest on knowledge of necessary con- nexion. In the particular case in point, unless we know that the sensum refers to some physical object to whose nature the charac- teristics of the sensum give some clue, we cannot have probable belief that the object is a horse or a chair. [These general con- siderations are dogmatically stated and not clearly worked out, but they are already familiar from Studies (Paper XIV) and from Mind and Matter (pp. 117-120) so I shall not discuss them here.] Book II deals with ' Matter and our Knowledge of it ' and largely oVerlaps Mind and Matter and Stout's other works on perception.</page><page sequence="5">J. D. MABBOTT: God and Nature 527 All theories which reduce the physical world to families of actual and possible sensa fail because reference to a physical object is needed to determine the set of possibilities and to give grounds for asserting them. What makes a family of sensa a family is relation to one physical object, and reference to the physical world is re- quired to determine what sensa are possible. To reduce a chair to sensa some of which are possible-e.g. the sensum I should have if I were in the next room-presupposes a physical order, e.g. my body and the next room and the chair in it. Measurement and causal laws alike require that a physical object should have one single shape and size and position. [Some of these arguments anticipate interestingly, in their own way, certain recent criticisms of phenomenalism.] Stout holds that in sensation the physical object is known through the incompleteness of the sensum; and he goes on to claim that this knowledge of the physical object is not merely knowledge that it exists but extends to some -of its charac- teristics. The physical object is known as ' akin in nature to the sensum' and as 'conditioning the occurrence of the sensum in the mode in which it occurs' (p. 145)-that is, as causally active. Stout finds parallels for such knowledge through incompleteness of an immediate datum in other fields. Universals (- classes, on Stout's view) are neither immediately known nor inferred. They are known as supplementing the incompleteness of the particulars with which alone we are directly acquainted. A directly presented image points beyond itself to the previous impression of which it is a copy and which supplements its incompleteness. [This seems doubtful. It would be a more plausible line to say that when I imagine myself in a particular situation, I have an image but the image is recognizably incomplete and points beyond itself to the whole situation which I imagine through it.] In memory what is remembered is past and must be known through the incompleteness of some mode of present immediate experience. In time awareness generally, the present alone is immediately given, but is known to be incomplete as having emerged from the past and as merging into the future. Thus, all through, ' given or inferred ' are not exhaus- tive alternatives; 'known through the incompleteness of the given' is the third alternative on which, in all these examples and particu- larly in the vital case of knowledge of physical objects, Stout relies. Chapter VIII on 'External and Internal Perception' is one of the most interesting-in the book. Stout gives a careful account of Introspection, Organic Sensation, Motor Sensation, and Perception. Internal perception is of two kinds; in motor sensation the order and occurrence of the sensations is within our own control (e.g. in willed muscular movement). In organic sensation (e.g. tickles, aches, itches) the occurrence- and order is beyond our control. In both these cases it does not make sense to distinguish between the presented order and the order of physical occurrence. But in perception the order and occurrence of sensa is partly subject to ou?</page><page sequence="6">528 CRITICAL NOTICES: will and partly not and this makes it possible to distinguish between presented order and real order of the events in question, and thus to build up our. knowledge of the physical world. It is through the achievements and, failures of efforts against resistance that we become aware of a world external to our bodies (and the distinction between subjective and objective succession is only a special Case of this). [But are these sharp distinctions tenable ? In the case of a nervous tic,. do I not have motor sensations wholly beyond my control ? When I try not to sneeze, I have an experience, some- times suecessful, sometimes not, of effort against resistance. But sneezing is an example of organic (and motor ?) sensation and not a clue to an object external to my body. Nevertheless it seems to me that Stout is clearly right in the main here and that our know- ledge: of the external world is built up in the way he suggests.] Stout argues that all external perception is accompanied by organic sensation. We are constantly aware of our sense-organs while using them to apprehend external objects. This is obvious in the case of touch, but Stout has considerable difficulty in justi- fying it over sight. How do-, we apprehend the eye in seeing ? [There is a mistake or misprint on p. 150: 'We apprehend the eye as something we see in distinction from the thing seen' ; this should read '. . . as something with which we see ', as is made clear in the preceding sentence on p. 150 and again on p. 159.] How then are we ' perpetually aware of our sense-organ 'in sight ? Stout gives two answers, both of them very difficult to accept. We are aware of different parts of the eye as each seeing a different part.of the visual field. We are aware of the centre as seeing more clearly, of the marginal parts as seeing more indistinctly. [But surely this is inference from the characteristics of the things seen ahd not direct organic sensation.] The second answer is this. Sensa occupy places in the visual field (which Stout calls 'the local sign continuum of sight '). This visual field remains constant how- ever much the; sensa vary; it is 'a fixed system of distinguishable places which can be occupied by different sensa '. [This is reminis- cent of Kant's view that we directly apprehend empty space, and seems as difficult to accept or to understand.] It was asserted above that any sensation' group whose order is invariable and independent of our will is anb organic sensation group. Hence, since the order of 'places' in the local sign continuum is invariable it is inferred that it is apprehended by organic sensation yielding knowledge of the body of the percipient. Since the continuum is visual the part of the body so apprehended must be the seeing eye. Chapters IX aund X go on to give a careful analysis of the process by which we determine the nature of the physical world, by dis- tinguishing empirically and experimentally conditions due to sense- organ, medium, and object. The principle of causality is pre- supposed throughout these empirical processes and is itself a primary datlum. [Con;ipare. Whitehead's similar view on this point.].</page><page sequence="7">J. D. MABBOTT: God and Nature 529 Our primitive and basic awareness of our sensum includes know- ledge that is caused by a physical object akin to it in nature: but this does not determine in detail the characteristics of this object. This is done by induction with one single exception. In the case of physical effects due to conscious effort we are aware of a con- nexion between the effort and the effect. This is not a necessary connexion between the two in isolation. We are aware that the effort can be a factor in the total cause of the effect and will be so if certain other factors are present. Our other source of determina- tion of the detailed nature of a physical object is measurement, and in the last resort measurement by superposition, of which Stout gives a complicated and ingenious analysis. He accepts the reality of secondary qualities and he holds that the real colours are those seen by a normal eye in ordinary daylight and not those seen in twilight or by the colour-blind. ['Normal' is a difficult word here especially if, as seems likely, it means only 'average'. Anyone who wishes to hold that some seen colours are real and others not would be better advised to hold that the real colour is that to which approximation is made by the eye or the light or the instrument which discriminates most consistently between the greatest variety of shades. This is in fact the principle Stout himself implicitly adopts when he admits that colours seen through a microscope are real though not revealed to 'normal eyes in ordinary daylight'. It is the principle implied in tests for colour-blindness, but it leads to the admission that artists and dress designers may meet such tests better than ordinary men with ' normal ' eyes. And ' ordinary daylight ' would cover anything from Mentone to Manchester. Any artist will tell us how rare a 'good light' is and his principle for deciding which light is good is again the principle of maximum differentiation stated above.] Chapter XI returns to the nature of sensa. Sensa are continuous with and akin to physical objects and are therefore material not mental in character. They are parts of matter but not parts of physical objects; they are the parts of matter directly presented to mind. Book IV on 'The Universal Correlation of Mind and Matter' uses the conclusions established in Book III to reach general meta- physical results. Stout holds, in agreement with Berkeley and against Alexander and an early view of Moore, that no sensum could exist unperceived. For some sensa (organic) cannot exist unperceived and no line can easily be drawn between them and the others, especially if we accept Ward's view that all sensa arise from differentiation of a relatively homogeneous presentation- continuum. All sensa then are mind-dependent. But sensa are parts of matter, so matter is mind-dependent also. (This con- clusion is fortified by the argument of Mind and Matter that mind cannot be matter-dependent but can be derived only from mind.) But does matter depend on mind or on minds? Do finite minds 34</page><page sequence="8">530 CRITICAL NOTICES: arise from other finite minds (which would involve a monadistic metaphysic), or from mental existence below the level of finite minds (a mind-stuff metaphysic), or from universal mind? Monad- ism is inadequate because of its denial of relations (and anyhow it requires a Universal Mind for its pre-established harmony). Mind-stuff theories appeal to scientists because of their atomistic analogies, but no intelligible thepry of combination or intera"ction bf such mental atoms can account for the unity of a personality. There remains the hypothesis of a Universal Mind-and this is Stout's second theistic argument. [It is not clear whether the argu- ment is that sensa depend on finite minds and finite minds on Universal Mind, or that sensa themselves, or Matter, depend on Universal Mind. If the former is intended this section adds no theistic force to the argument of Mind and Matter. But if, as seems more likely, the latter is the meaning, there are serious difficulties. All the positive evidence for mind-dependence of sensa is for dependence on finite minds. Is the suggestion that those features of sensa not dependent on finite minds depend on Universal Mind (Berkeley's view) or that the parts of matter other than sensa depend on Universal Mind also ? There is no argument for either conclusion, and at least the first involves attributing sensa- tion to God (as Stout admits on p. 241) and further difficulties in reconciling the continuity Stout defends between sensum, matter, and physical object with any distinction between dependence on finite and dependence on infinite Mind.] Chapter XIV analyses the conception of a universal mind and shows it to be compatible with the reality of finite minds (against Bradley's arguments). Chapter XV discusses the correlation of the mind-matter and mind-body problems and concludes that the mind-matter problem is basic. The mind-body problem so far as it concerns epistemology is the problem of the relation of sensa to brain-states. But we have seen that sensa are parts of matter so this is a problem within the material world. The facts of reproduction, retentiveness and as- sociation require the continuance of sensa or of their conditions in the world of matter including perhaps (though not necessarily) in that part of matter we know as the brain. But material con- ditions alone will not account for these facts, for they involve cognitive, conative and affective- dispositions. Here we require mind as well as matter to provide the continuity involved, and the mind required must be the universal mind. This is Stout's third theistic argument. Psycho-physical dispositions as continuing ele- ments in our mental lives are inexplicable without reference to a single universal mind. [Again there seems to be a gap in the argument. Why should niot the continuity be given by finite minds ? And it is difficult to understand how a universal mind which is eternal can explain dispositions which, while enduring, are not eternal but have a beginning and an end. Nevertheless,</page><page sequence="9">J. D. MABBOTT: God and Nature 531 against purely materialistic or brain-trace theories the argument has force, and the alternative theory (of finite minds) usually involves the notion of the unconscious which has difficulties of its own.] This ends the argument for the existence of a universal mind based on our knowledge of matter. Book V deals with our knowledge of mind. Our own minds are kn.own to us neither directly nor by inference but (as before, the third alternative) in knowing subjective states as essentially in- complete; 'pleasure and desire reveal themselves as phases in the life-history of a subject'. [This section is tantalizingly brief and sketchy, especially from Stout.] How do we know about other minds ? Not by inference from bodily behaviour: this would mean that we know our own minds directly but other minds only through resemblances between our bodies and theirs. In fact, however, 'there is a primary demand for psychical existence beyond the individual self '. That this psychical existence takes the form, in certain cases, of finite minds like our own is indeed an inference based on bodily behaviour and on responsiveness to practical action. But this tentative inference works from and within a more basic certainty that there is mind beyond our own in the world. [Here is another example of a type of argument frequently found in Stout. It is perhaps to be traced to Kant whose influence on Stout is noticeable throughout. Hume had distinguished two questions: (a) Why do we say every event has a cause ?-the general principle, (b) Why do we say this event has this par- ticular cause ?-the particular causal law-e.g. that microbes cause disease. Hume ' found it convenient to sink ' question (a) in question (b)-where it remained sunk without trace-and answered question (b) by the theory of induction. He thought that ' perhaps the same answer will serve for both questions '. Kant accepts Hiume's answer to question (b) but does not think it will serve for question (a). 'Special laws . . . cannot in their specific character be derived from the categories though they are one and all subject to them. To obtain any knowledge of these special laws we must resort to experience, but it is the a priori laws alone which can instruct us in regard to experience in general and as to what it is that can be known as an object of experience' (Critique of Pure Reason, Ed. II, p. 165; Kemp Smith's translation p. 173). So with causality, Stout maintains that we are directly aware of a single sense datum as having been caused by something continuous with and akin to it; within this basic and certain knowledge we proceed to infer, fallibly and inductively, that the cause is a horse or a chair.] In support of this vital step in his argument Stout urges the following point,: (a) if I were primarily aware only of my own mind I could never think of other minds as even possible nor of my own mind as mine (' only my own' implies the possibility of others) (b) primitive animism certainly does not rest its belief in other</page><page sequence="10">532 CRITICAL NOTICES: minds on analogy with human bodies or on responsiveness of a type similar to our own actions. So such inference cannot be basic to our awareness of other minds; [this is a strong and interesting point]; (c) even now we treat things as active individuals; the concept of force, never observable in nature and useless to science, is ineradicable from our ordinary thought; (d) in aesthetic ex.peri- ence we find mind attributed to nature and not merely as a play of the imagination or by the pathetic fallacy; at its most sublime, e.g. in Wordsworth, this aesthetic experience of a mind behind things borders on religion; (e) religion in its turn claims to carry convic- tion of a mind behind all phenomena. If it is objected that God can be explained as an anthropomorphism [or as a father-substitute -though Stout does not add this] the answer is that anthropomor- phism explains only the crudities; the errors, the superstitions, and the heresies in religion, The most devefoped religions are freest from it [and from father-substitute elements also]. These points taken together may be held to constitute Stout's fourth theistic argument-that in our awareiiess of the external world' we are aware of a mind other than our own and mind not exhausted by those finite minds for which at any given time we happen to have empirical evidence. Stout finds a ftfth theistic argument in a restated' form of the argument from design. This section (like the corresponding section in Mind and Matter) is the least convincing in the book. Nature is said to reveal a teleological order as well as a'causal order. [But Stout completely fails to give any clear meaning to ' teleological '. "Co.mplexity', a system ', and ' perfection ' are all terms 'used to explain it. 'Perfection' is obviously a question-begging term, and * 'system' seems to mean no more than complexity. 'Adaptation to a purpose' is certainly not meant, as is shown by the example of the structure of chemical molecules. The carbon compounds in particular show teleological order in a very high degree. Then having used 'teleological' in this very Pickwickian sense, he seems to take' advantage of its ordinary sense to imply a design and a designer, as for example when he argues that ' existing teleological arrangements presuppose prior teleological arrangements adapted to account for them '. ' Adapted ' and ' to account for ' seem to slip in design, unless he is prepared to rewrite the sentence to read 'the causal conditions of a complex whole must be at least as complex as the whole to which 'they give rise', which is a doubtful proposition in itself and is in any case in no sense a rehabilitation of the argument from design.] At the end of this section, however, a new and more plausible argument-the sixth theistic argument S emerges, though it rests at a crucial point on one of the most de- batable conclusions of Mind and Matter.' The argument is this: (a) Particular teleological systems (such as watches) which are pro- ducts of human will indicate a prior teleolQgical system (of thoughts and desires) in the mind of the maker. (b) But individual minds</page><page sequence="11">J. D. MABBOTT: God and Nature 533 are not isolated teleological systems. Life is a complex transaction between individual and environment; the mind of the watchmaker is only one set of conditions among others of almost equal com- plexity wbich are required for the production of a watch. So the total set of conditions must be grasped as a whole if we are to understand the making of a watch. Now this whole teleological system created by the interlocking of individual minds with en- vironment can be explained in two ways. Either the system as a whole is evidence of the presence of universal mind, or the system as a whole "is material and some of these material conditions give rise here and there' to the sub-systems we call finite minds. But the second solution, epiphenomenalism (or 'materialism' in Stout's usage), has, been refuted in Mind and Matter. So only the first remains; and in support. of this it may be pointed out that tele- ology belongs essentially to mind as such-a mind-which was not a teleological system would not be a mind. But matter may or may not be teleologically organized. The last sections of the book (Chapters XVII to XXI) argue that the unity of the mind implies the unity of the universe. This is argued first (Chapter XVII) in connexion with cognition. The unity of the mind in knowing presupposes the systematic unity of the universe known. This Kantian argument is combined (not without difficulty) with the non-Kantian view that the knowing mind does not determine the structure of what is known. The argument is that ignorance is always partial. What we do not know we always to some extent do know as connected with what we 4now already. If there were two experiences between which there could be no knowable relation this would be equivalent to saying the two experiences must belong to different minds. For experiences to be related, their objects must be related too. If I were aware of two universes between which there were no intel- ligible relations, I should not be a single cognitive self. And indeed it is just so far as, in extreme cases, some people approaoh this condition that we have to speak of schizophrenia or dissociated personality. Thus, for me to have achieved a (relatively) unified cognitive self I must know a (partially) unified universe. And so far as my ignorance itself is, as it must be, the partial awareness of other conditions intelligibly linked with what I know already, I have (potentially) a fully unified cognitive mind, but this potentiality presupposes a fully unified universe. [The argument hereabouts seems to turn a great deal on the word ' know ' and the chapter ends with a section (pp. 272-280) on this subject. 'Knowing-' is neither an act nor a state of mind nor a relation between a mind and its objects. But I have fouind it quite impossible to discover Stout's positive view of what knowing is.] Knowing and being then 'are essentially and inseparably united aspects of the whole universe. [Stout is here, I think, converting the proposition, which he has so far proved, that the unity of the mind implies the unity of the</page><page sequence="12">534 CRITICAL NOTICES: universe, and suggesting that the unity of the universe implies a' single universal mind. But this conversion is undefended.] It follows that there must always have been knowing minds or mind. 'Minds' are ruled out by the anti-monadistic arguments of the earlier chapters: and how could finite minds know the given as incomplete and as ultimately implying the whole of nature unless they had tieir source in infinite mind. Here is the seventh theistic argument. [It is an idealist argument familiar in Green and Bosanquet and I shall not comment on it further.] Finally we have the eighth theistic argument, said by Stout (p. 288) to be so important that all the rest of the book is but preparatory to it. This is the argument from the unity of interest found in the practical and moral life to the unity of the universe. (Chapters XIX and XXI-Chapter XX is a digression on dissociations.) Unity of interest is low in animals and children whose desires operate successively and independently of each other. It is higher in lives such as those of Scrooge or Macbeth which are unified in the service of some particular and limited purpose-wealth or t'mbition. But, as they did both in Scrooge and in Macbeth, the suppressed desires keep revolting against such monomaniac control. Only on the highest levels of morality (in Wordsworth's 'happy warrior') or religion (in the lives of the saints) do we find real unity of interest, that unity of which happiness and peace of mind are the sure symptoms. There is no final satisfaction in any finite good. If we aim to satisfy individual desires as they come, failure is cer- tain; we all know 'the vanity of human wishes'. If 'good' meant simply what is desired, as Hobbes held, this pessimism would be the last word. Stout invokes the parallel of truth. If truth was merely what happened to be believed, there would be countless truths contradicting each other. But truth is objective. So too with good. Good is what ought to be desired and this is inde- pendent of actual desire. Value belongs to the constitution of the universe. We can thus justifiably argue that an ideally unified self is possible only in relation to an ideally unified objective good. For human beings the goal is unattainable; and so, in another sense, failure is certain. (A man who is proud of his human success reveals the limitations of his aim and the shallowness of his mind.) But it is a failure which is aware of its direction and which does not tarnish the achievement in that direction which it accompanies. And the men who are most acutely aware of it are also, by their very humility, witnesses to the reality of their ideals, and them- selves vividly aware of the universe as a moral universe. [This culminating argument is very briefly and not always clearly stated. Nevertheless there seems to be considerable force in its main con- tention. At the heights of "Moral experience men do seem to have been vividly aware of being at home in the universe. If the uni- verse were really materialistic should we not, as clear-sighted realists, eat drink and be merry ? If it is pluralistic, should we not</page><page sequence="13">M.

Life should be like reality, just one damn thing after another. Unless the universe is a moral univ"erse, we must admit that the higher the moral life ascends the greater the illusions it involves; and we shall find it hard to explain how any being whiZch, like all beings, is merely finite could ever have such illusions at all.] [It is of course difficult to review, such a book as this at a time when the general atmosphere of phllosophy has become so rarefied that no metaphysical argument can survive in it; and the whole work will make littVe appeal to those who know a priori that this sort of thing just cannot be done. But even they, if they will avert their eyes from words such as 'God', 'nature', 'whole', and 'universe', will find here incidental discussions well worth careful consideration. I refer particularly to the sections on ex- ternal and internal perception (Chapter VIII), on measurement (Chapter X), on brain and mind (Chapter XV), and on conflict and dissociation (Chapter XX). I have' treated the argument, as it was meant by its author to be treated, as a metaphysical alternative to other metaphysics. In this capacity, as against materialism, monadism and mind-stuff theories, it seems to me to make a strong case. As for its own special contribution, the impression it leaves in the end is that all the eight theistic arguments, despite gaps and obscurities in some of them, deserve careful scrutiny and that the fourth and the eighth particularly do go some way to support the claims of religious experience. The effect of selecting the theistic arguments for emphasis and discussion in this review has inevitably been to focus attention on the most difficult and debatable sections of the work; anid this has suggested a degree of doubt and disagreement which is out of proportion to the truth. It may well be that the present fashion in philosophy is only one of those recurrent anti-metaphysical phases of which the history of philosophy is full. In that case God and Nature should share in any revival of interest in ultimate questions.] J. D. MABBOTT. Oxford University</page></plain_text>
