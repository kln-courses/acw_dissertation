These three books demonstrate a renewal of interest in the art and architecture of Latin America last seen on this scale perhaps thirty years ago. Until now Leopoldo Castedo's brief, accessible A History of Latin American Art and Architecture, first published in 1969, was almost the only general survey of the field. It is of course far more difficult to write a short, accurate survey than a close-focus specialist study, but had the demand been there it would surely have been replaced before now. Castedo's book is still a valuable basic reference work and an authorial tour de force, but has long been out of print, and John F. Scott's Latin American Art: Ancient to Modern helps to fill the gap. In some ways it complements rather than supersedes Castedo. Scott covers the art and architecture of the whole region from earliest times to the present day but the balance is very different. Whereas Castedo divides the material into three roughly equal</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 2 13 sections - pre-columbian, colonial and modern - four out of Scott's six chapters are devoted to the art and architecture produced during the 20 millennia or so before the arrival of the Europeans, during which the region was anything but Latin. This makes the book's title - Latin American Art - even more problematic than it is with Castedo, and given that the subtitle 'Ancient to Modern' does not appear on the book's spine, it will be all too easy for someone in search of a useful introduction to pre-columbian material to look elsewhere. This is a pity, because this is the book's real strength. Scott's approach is essentially chronological and the geographical range is very wide. This makes for a much more stimulating book than would be the case if it were a merely a summary of the achievements of the high cultures of Mesoamerica and the Andes. It is useful to be reminded, for example, that the earliest known pottery comes not from these later centres of high culture but from the Caribbean coast of Colombia and dates from over 3000 BC. The second chapter, 'First High Cultures', includes Olmec and Chavin as would be expected, but also acknowledges the Olmec-related developments in Guatemala and Costa Rica. Scott's introduction makes it clear that he does not want to suggest that all these cultures were interrelated (although his method encourages a more open- minded attitude towards long-distance trade than many specialists care to foster) but, rather that in indicating parallels between the various cultures, he wants to suggest that in similar circumstances humans tend to arrive independently at similar solutions. This is admirably demonstrated in this compressed, well- illustrated format, where, turning the pages, it is hard not to be struck by the general parallels between, say, the staff god of the Raimondi Stela from Chavin, Peru, and the Alligator God of Panama: each represents an anthropomorphic being in full-frontal pose with a staff in each hand, clawed feet, reptilian belt and exaggerated teeth. The latter is another example of Scott's efforts to include material beyond the more obvious and canonical. In the colonial and post- Independence chapters he extends this to encompass examples often excluded from the general category 'Latin America', such as the magnificent eighteenth- century fagade of the church of San Jose and San Miguel de Aguayo in San Antonio, Texas, for example, and the murals in Port-au-Prince of the 1940s by the Haitian artist Wilson Bigaud. Many of the illustrations are Scott's own photographs, giving the book a particular freshness and authenticity. Of course it is limited. The last chapter, 'Art after Independence' feels particularly skimpy given the enormous production (what about the extra- ordinarily innovative Kineticism of Venezuela or Neo-Concretism of Brazil?), but this is a worthy successor to Castedo and for those who get beyond the limitations of the title it will be at least as useful as an introduction and for general reference. It is clearly written, tightly structured, generously illustrated and has a good bibliography which, like the text, includes some out-of-the-way items as well as standard studies. Latin American Architecture: Six Voices edited by Malcolm Quantrill is a different approach to the problem of how to tell a big story in a single volume. In this case the big story is that of the architecture of Latin America from - roughly - the collapse in confidence in high modernism (in other words from about 1960 or post-Brasflia) to the present. It uses the case-study format: six architects from six different countries are chosen to represent, or 'speak for' the architecture of the region. For each example we have a selection of projects,</page><page sequence="3">214 Reviews illustrated and briefly described, and an interpretative essay by a critic of the architect's own country. A lively, polemical introduction by the late Marina Waisman (to whom the book is dedicated) addresses some of the key issues. She identifies elements of shared history and culture, especially language, which from the time of the conquest have shaped Latin America and given it continues to face. She succinctly outlines the way in which, from Independence in the early nineteenth century until perhaps the 196os, architectural taste in Latin American has alternated between European and nationally-inspired models, and identifies some of the most successful projects as those that manage to reconcile the two. She has refreshingly little time for the self-satisfied negativity of post-modern theory: while acknowledging the limitations of the universalism of modernity Waisman argues that at least the model served to inspire practice. She warns against the post-modern tendency to criticise without offering solutions, especially in Latin America where new housing and other basic facilities are still so urgently needed. Her conclusions are generally positive and encouraging. She sees an interesting diversity of approach, and an increase in confidence among a number of architects in Latin America, in contrast to what she calls the 'desolate picture of international architecture' (p. 19). The six architects have presumably been chosen to illustrate this. One could of course quibble about the selection. Clorindo Testa (Argentina), Christian de Groote (Chile), Rogelio Salmona (Colombia), Ricardo Legorreta (Mexico) and Eladio Deste (Uruguay) are certainly eminent representatives of their respective countries. To my mind there are perhaps more interesting Venezuelan architects that Jestis Tenreiro-Degwitz but at least he has the advantage of not being based in Caracas and so we are given a rare glimpse of what is going on outside the capital. The most glaring omission is that of Brazil, something acknowledged by Frampton in his curiously ambivalent preface. Brazil was at the forefront of modern architecture in Latin America from the 930os to the 196os and although Brasflia has repeatedly been identified (in my view unfairly) as epitomising its failures, this was not the end of the story. And if Brazilian architectural confidence wavered during the sixties and seventies it is now very much restored and it seems perverse to leave it out of a book that aims to introduce the region's overlooked achievements to the rest of the world. What about, as Frampton suggests, Mendes da Rocha, or Severiano Porto as mentioned by Waisman? Or Lina Bo Bardi? After all, there are so few successful women architects in this very male profession. In the preface Frampton identifies two lines of interrelated development among those chosen - the 'sensuous minimalist aesthetic' of Barragain on the one hand (Legorreta and De Groote) and the 'tectonic wing of the modern tradition' on the other (Testa, Dieste, Salmona and Tenreiro-Degwitz). The common ground between them, however, is considerable. All avoid the variations on the glass tower typical of international high- and post-modernity. One of the continuing strengths of Latin American architecture is, ironically, the relative economic dependency of the region: labour is cheap, high-tech materials are expensive. Shuttered concrete rather than Miesian steel and glass has been the building material of choice, and since the 193os has been used for its aesthetic as well as practical qualities: the impress of the wooden planking points up the irony of modern buildings constructed using traditional techniques that involve considerable manual skill, and, of course, the rough texture looks good in strong</page><page sequence="4">Reviews 215 sunlight. Testa used it to good effect for many of the internal surfaces of his wonderful Bank of London and South America building in Buenos Aires of 1959-1966; De Groote has used it in elite private houses. In both cases one could say that is makes a nice contrast with the suave appearance of the inhabitants. Another anti-modern tendency is the use of brick. Modernist architectural theory (Le Corbusier, the Bauhaus) favoured modern industrially-produced materials over traditional but in Latin America many architects (all six represented in this volume but especially Dieste and Salmona) have made imaginative use of brick and tile, often for very large-scale projects. Other features commonly associated with Latin American design - sun-screens, tropical gardens, water, intermediate spaces between interior and exterior, references to colonial or pre-Columbian architecture, the use of colour - are all represented by one or other of these six architects. But if this book were a building, I am afraid one would have to say that it has been very badly constructed. It has evidently been assembled over a period of at least fifteen years, and has involved almost as many editors and authors, but no single guiding architect. The essays are uneven in approach and in the case of Mariano Arana's essay on Dieste the translation is awkward to the point of unintelligibility. Inevitably, perhaps, given that these are all pretty much grand old men of twentieth-century Latin American architecture, the essays do not sustain the critical distance of Waisman's introduction, nor, on the whole, do they succeed in placing their subjects within her broader framework. In some cases there are a few footnotes but no general suggestions for further reading, even though there is good literature available on most of these architects, including some important and easily accessible studies in English (John Mutlow on Legorreta, for example). Unfortunately, the poor quality black and white photographs make the buildings look dreary; in fact the images are not so much black and white as grey, and in some cases even out of focus. Many of these projects, even, in some cases I think, these same photographs, have been much better reproduced elsewhere. So, regretfully, I think that this book will not persuade those who know nothing of modern architecture in Latin America to look further. If the term 'Latin American' is problematic as a descriptor for the content of Scott's book, and the problem of 'Latin American' architectural identity is the focus of Quantrill's collection, behind both lies the notion of some sort of unity of culture within a defined geographical area. Laurence A. Herzog's From Aztec to High Tech: Architecture and Landscape across the Mexico-United States Border illustrates the challenge globalisation offers to our academic attempts to generalise and categorise something like culture. Herzog's focus is, in effect, the cultural borderland of the geographical borderland between Latin America and the USA, a region where Hispanics, Chicanos, Latinos, Californios and Anglos, as well as Mexicans, Americans and Mexican Americans live in sometimes uneasy juxtaposition. (It would be interesting to know something about the history and local perception of these terms, and the power relations they reflect. I doubt if the many US residents of Mexico refer to themselves as American Mexicans, for example.) In many ways the states in this region (California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas to the north, Baja California, Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Le6n and Tamaulipas to the south) have more in common with each other than they do with the rest or their respective countries, and indeed the Economist</page><page sequence="5">z16 Reviews recently suggested it now makes some sense to think of it as a separate country. Economically they are deeply interdependent, particularly through the maquila- doras, the twin-plant system of manufacture, whereby parts for an industrial commodity are made in the USA, transported to Mexico to be assembled using cheap Mexican labour, and then back into the USA for distribution. The region as a whole is experiencing enormous growth in population and GDP, and so in urban expansion. Herzog, a professor of city planning, is interested in the developing border culture, the ways in which the different urban traditions of Latin and Anglo America are evolving and interacting. The issues of national identity and regional modernism addressed in Quantrill's Latin American Architecture are here reviewed in the Mexican context, but Herzog's focus is on the broader urban sphere rather than on individual buildings. He observed that whereas north of the border the eclecticism of post- modernism has been embraced as a design philosophy, in Mexico 'memory is taken seriously' and that far from discarding history and meaning, recent Mexican architecture has been 'a kind of thoughtful search for a way to resolve the age-old dialectic of past and future (p. 39). Herzog's study is in some ways a dialogue between the authenticity (real or apparent) of the Mexican urban landscape and the inauthenticity of developments north of the border. Conquering peoples have traditionally tried to impose their mark on the landscape by rejecting local architectural styles in favour of their own. The conquering Spaniards did it in the Americas in the sixteenth century. After Mexico lost its northern territories to the USA in the I840s the conquering Anglos did the same in what became known as the American Southwest. Herzog traces how the incomers rejected the Mexican house type - solid, enclosed adobe structures - in favour of the East Coast pattern of wooden houses, outward- looking and with big windows. He notes how inappropriate this was for the climate, and how the wealthy inhabitants of cities like Phoenix had to move their beds out into the backyard during the summer heat. In their heated search for an identity more appropriate to their new home, the immigrants to California then began to create a mythical version of the Spanish past. This began in the I89os as the California Mission Revival - whitewashed 'adobe look' walls and lots of arcades - which was replaced, after 1915, with the Spanish Colonial Revival, a more baroque version in many ways more Andalusian than colonial, with ornate portals and Moorish details. Neither had anything to do with real history. On the other hand, while the US borders indulged in the luxury of creating identities for themselves based on a version of what they perceived as the region's hispanic heritage, their much poorer Mexican neighbours recognised the benefits of marketing a fake version of Mexico for the wealthy visitors from across the border. Interwoven with ideas of authenticity along the border is that of the different approaches to public space. Herzog is surely right in arguing that US culture has more or less abandoned the public spaces - the streets and squares - of their cities: only in the enclosed security of the shopping mall or Disneyland's Main Street USA are people happy to stroll and mingle. In Latin America the street and the square have retained their importance as places where people meet, where events are celebrated or protests mounted. Herzog surveys the history of the architectural relations between north and south and finds evidence of the decline in importance of public space in the south and a tendency to reclaim it in the</page><page sequence="6">Reviews 217 north, at least in districts with hispanic populations. One particular project that Herzog refers to on several occasions typifies the complexities of the field. In San Diego local Chicano residents reclaimed an area beneath the freeway to create a public space and named it Chicano Park. They commissioned Mexican-born, San Diego-resident architect Alfredo Larin to design a kiosk and the result is a brightly-painted neo-Aztec structure that seems to proclaim its authentic inauthenticity. In Tijuana across the border the neo-Aztec style is chosen to attract the tourists, to designate its Mexicanness in a deliberately inauthentic way; in San Diego in Chicano Park, the intended audience and the cultural implications are almost inverted. There is perhaps a slightly rosy tint to the Latin part of the equation. As well as the sociability implied in the use of public space Herzog evidently enjoys the inventiveness of the hispanic migrants on both sides of the border in creating homes, barrios, colonias, out of nothing; he enjoys the street vendors, the tendency to domesticate and personalise the urban environment with exuberant signs, murals and graffiti. One photo caption (fig 6.5) states simply that 'One of the striking qualities of Mexican border townscapes is the people'. I lost count of the number of times places south of the border were referred to as 'dusty', a usefully flexible word suggesting both the climate and the relative poverty, but also, more attractively, a sense of history: things get dusty when they have been forgotten, unused or unexplored for long periods of time. The book ends with a series of statements by architects living and working on both sides of the border. It is noteworthy that those living in the Land of the Free envy Mexico's lack of urban planning regulations. As Rob Quigley, a San Diego architect put it, 'We just seem to thrive on restrictions. In Tijuana, with a lot less rules, there is a more coherent result. You get a vibrancy, a spontaneity.' But Herzog demonstrates that the Mexican contribution to the urban landscapes on both sides of the border is very significant. As with Quantrill's Latin American Architecture, better-quality photographs would have strengthened the argument as well as making for a much more attractive book, but From Aztec to High Tech is full of interest and ideas.
