<plain_text><page sequence="1">Istoricheskaia Poet?ka (A Historical Poetics) Chapter 1, Section 8 Aleksandr Nikolaevich Veselovskii1 Epos and lyric presented us with the consequences of the dissolution of the ancient ritual chorus. Drama, in its first artistic manifestations, preserved all of ritual chorus' syncretism, ele ments of action, archaic form of narration, and dialogue, but in forms cemented by cult, the mythic content of which unified a mass of animistic and demonistic notions that had become widespread. Cult tradition helped to stabilize choral tradition and required regular performers, 21s not all were privileged to know myths in their diversity. The rites of this caste, maintained as an inheritance by its elders, informed the conduct of a group of professionals, priests of a cult. They knew the prayers and the hymns. They narrated the myth or acted it out. The masks which had been used in imitative activities now served a new purpose: they appeared on the personages of religious legends, gods and heroes, in a succession of recitatives, dialogues, and choral refrains. This is how, at a theoretical level, one can conceive of the develop ment of drama. It will be born as art as it emerges from its origins in cult. Its artistry originates in the humanized and human content of myth, in those aspects of myth which engender spiritual interests, present ques tions of the moral order, inner struggles, fate, and responsibility. Greek drama is of this sort. The dramatic action which originated in the ritual chorus has a different form: it is restricted to a mythological or epic theme laid out in dialogue with the accompaniment of a chorus and dance (India), or it presents, in close proximity to ritual, a number of everyday scenes which are poorly connected or unconnected by a central thread. The Atellan play and the mime of southern Italy are of this sort. Through all of its developmental stages we will encounter traces of the old choral structure, sometimes all the more clearly where we expect them least and in the most convoluted form where, it would seem, proximity to the ritual precursor should guarantee their remain ing intact. Interference from extraneous legends sometimes obfuscates the true course of evolution, but one can cast light upon it at many points. I will at least indicate differences in the social position of actors. New Literary History, 2001, 32: 409-428</page><page sequence="2">410 NEW LITERARY HISTORY I will begin with the Siberian Bear Drama. It is closest of all to the beginning of this evolution, still vacillating between ritual and cult. Festivals in honor of the bear are widespread amongst non-Russians of western and eastern Siberia, among the Giliaks, the Ainov, and others. They are connected with the respect, widespread among them, for the bear as a being endowed with godlike strength and wisdom, the son of heaven or the supreme creator (the Ostiaks, the Voguls). They are also connected with an ancient and at one time widespread pre-Hellenic cult, which held sway in the practice of the Attic Brauroneia, as well as in the remnants of European beliefs and superstitions, old and new, which formerly provoked the denunciations of the church. In the case of our non-Russian peoples, elements which in Europe were preserved as fragmented experiences and which entered in an episodic way into the makeup of Greek anthropomorphic myths, coalesced into an indepen dent cycle of beliefs and rituals at various levels: from the festival of the hunt, with its game of imitation, to the activities of a cult with a divine bear-hero at its center. [...] [Cult drama was born] in the ritual chorus aimed at influencing the success of the hunt. At its base lay the same sort of mimic activity that can be found in the Buffalo Dance of North American Indians, which was meant to attract buffaloes to the plains they had abandoned. I will also mention the Australian representations of a raid upon the herd, the hunt, the skinning of the carcass, and so on. One of the scenes of the Bear Drama presents us with analogous content. It is still easy to discern the ancient dramatic elements of the ritual under the layers that accumulated later. The chorus, with a soloist at its head, sang of the bear and of his life in the forest and in heaven, and so forth. As it sang, it imitated in dance the movements of his body. Other related motifs were added to these aspects of the songs, and the range of the mimic activity broadened. Both old and new provided the content for individual scenes put on by special performers, actors. They were not professionals and nothing, it seems, would indicate their particular connection with the cult. Between certain scenes they would dance themselves, which, perhaps, implies a relationship with the dancing chorus from which the theatrical portion of the ritual had also been born. They were in constant contact with the audience, which would get involved in their activities. Yet at the same time they represented something special. They adopted new names for the duration of the dances and they were seen not as simple men but as men capable of representing another being, and perhaps a truer one?of appearing in another countenance as a god or demon. This mimic activity was aimed at enlisting the participation of supernatural forces in human affairs and one can suppose that in the</page><page sequence="3">FROM A HISTORICAL POETICS 411 early stage of cult drama the differentiation between imitation and the object of imitation was lost, so that drama became a kind of personified incantation, as I indicated earlier when speaking about the origins of religious drama among uncivilized peoples. Hence the use of masks. They could serve the goals of imitation, then of cult, differentiating familiar faces from the general crowd. If some assert that the masks of the Bear Drama were intended to hide the faces of the participants from the bear, who was intolerant of impudence, then this surely represents a later, etiological, explanation. The identification of the participant with the mask may also account for the freedom of speech that was irrevoca bly granted to the actors and then preserved by them through inheritance. We encounter this element in the origins of Greek drama in cult and in the south Indian agrarian ritual in honor of the local goddess of the countryside. This ritual consists of animal sacrifice, including the sacrifice of a holy bull. Although members of the Brahmin caste take part, the ritual is directed by natives of non-Aryan descent, Pariahs, and other castes held in contempt by the Brahmins. Among these are dancers of the Pariah caste, As?di or D?sasi, who serve in the temple of the goddess, including the musician Raniga, who plays the role of the buffoon. On the last day of the festival, a ceremonial procession walks over the communal fields bearing a representation of the goddess and the bull's head, and unruly behavior replaces the preceding solemnity. Raniga reprimands the goddess and the authorities, the elder of the village and every passerby [...]; the Pariahs and As?di [sic] fall upon the most respected local inhabitants [...], the dancers jump up on their shoulders, the shepherds beat on their drums. All of this leads to a catharsis of the unruly and contradictory feelings that have been aroused by the ceremonial ritual. They rose in connection with the cult, infected the audience, and assumed a different traditional flavoring in Eleusis. During the celebra tion of the Mysteries, when the procession which preceded the celebra tion crossed over the bridge on the Kefiss, caustic remarks and gibes showered down upon the participants. The phallaphoroi of the Dionysiac festival were the bearers of pointless jokes but also of satire, not members of the cult but of the watching crowd; after them came freedom of the word?material for the birth of Greek comedy. Studying the dramatic elements of the native rites of contemporary India would most likely shed light on the origins of Indian drama and its relations to cult and, likewise, on the development of the epos; both one and the other involve a good number of theoretical issues. Here, the point of departure was the poetry of the choral ceremony with its mimic dance, song-tale, and dialogue. "The dance is pleasing to the gods, its endless free movements seem to recreate universal harmony; and Uma,</page><page sequence="4">412 NEW LITERARY HISTORY an omnipotent ruler, dances in endless concord within it" (from Malavika and Agnimitra)} Siva is a dancer, this is his characteristic, and moreover he is a patron of actors. The Sanskrit name for drama? n?tya?indicates this syncretism. L?sya = dance embraces the concept of song and recitative. All three choral elements come together on the grounds of cult: certain hymns of the Rigueda are constructed in the amoebaean style, with the alternation of choruses and singers, the number of singers not exceeding three. In one hymn Indra converses with the Maruts and in the end a singer, a composer of song, intrudes. Such hymns stood outside the normal practice of cult. They were performed as a certain category of dialogue, of legendary tales. Oldenburg hypothesizes that at the basis of such hymns lay tales with this sort of content, which had never been given well-defined poetic form and which had been forgot ten, so that only the dialogues of the leading characters, of gods and holy men, had been preserved, reworked by a later performer. This indication that hymns of this type stood outside of cult attests, perhaps, to their more ancient origins. I have in mind one of the stages of the isolation of epic song from the alternation of singers in the ritual chorus; one would replace the other in dialogical development of some traditional theme, not going into details, not striving to unearth the root of a legend intelligible to all from the suggestive innuendos of the lyric-epic song. We now know that the epos of India was performed through exactly this process of alternation. Corresponding dialogical hymns of the Rigueda would serve to confirm the early intrusion of epic-dramatic narration into cult before cult practices had taken shape. From the point of view of isolating dramatic form, the title of epic or martial singer, one who narrated through dialogue, naturally carried over into the meaning of a player, actor. Certain genres of Indian drama, such as the vy?goga, are nothing other than legends, the beginning of a military story broken into scenes. One of the basic modes of speech employed in drama of the classic period, maghadi, has its origins, perhaps, in the m?gadhas, the ancient epic singers who were renowned throughout India. One type of Indian drama, as we may call it, as it took shape before the era of Kalidasa, consists, in essence, in the reworking of epic subject matter with an admixture of lyric elements, musical accompaniment, and imitative dancing. If this did not lead to a dramatic reworking of situations and characters, then this reflects the essence of the Indian worldview, which did not recognize psychological struggle but only the strength of a predestination that carried a man toward one or another fate, depending upon the services he had rendered or his transgres sions. Here we see a divergence in the development of Indian and Greek</page><page sequence="5">FROM A HISTORICAL POETICS 413 drama?although that isn't even the point: we are at the starting point of the evolution of forms and our concern is with the relationship of drama to cult, in which we discerned one of the preconditions of drama's artistic development. There is no obvious progression leading from the dialogical hymns of the Rigueda to the appearance of drama. The intermediate links are lost in local dialects, which have left their traces in the arts of the classical era and in the ornamented dialectic speech which is obligatory for actors playing lowly roles. [...] U] Nataka is a typical form of Indian artistic drama, a set of practices and a poetics worked out to the finest details. It imposed rules upon forms of native choral activity which we may justly regard as a preclassical regional development, drawing upon parallel choral activities familiar to us as a phenomenon among uncultured peoples. I will note, in passing, the role of the conductor, who, having uttered a prayer, appears in the prologue and in the main portion of the drama which he directs, leading out onto the stage one or another personage, explaining and fortelling the course of events to the audience. We have seen such directors in native mime performances and in the beginnings of theater; they descend from the ancient choral coryphaeus. The prayer, the benediction at the beginning of the play, links such drama to the sphere of cult. In Bengal, a chorus sings this prayer. It is followed by another, directed at the deity whom they are celebrating, with allusions to the appropriate season. Perhaps this is an archaic reference to the ancient custom of situating the action in relation to the calendar. A range of other religious formulas are invoked as well, for example, in the way that actors make themselves up. Drama entered the temple and was played out there in front of a statue of the divinity. A question spurred by the issue of the social position of those who performed it is whether in so doing it was born in the sphere of cult practice or simply adjoined it from its basis in choral activity. The close connection of Greek drama with the cult that had given rise to it continued right into the era of its flowering: drama was the form in which the people rendered homage to a deity. The sacred character of the activity was reflected in the status of actors as well. Their profession was not despised. They were treated with respect and not infrequently employed as ambassadors, and so on. It was different in India and China. Chinese actors would represent episodes from the life of Buddha before the temples, but their profession was despised. In India, their caste was one of the lowest; the Brahmins would not associate with them and could not accept their hospitality, even in case of dire need. They</page><page sequence="6">414 NEW LITERARY HISTORY had a reputation for gluttony and their wives as loose women who could be bought and sold by men. It was permissible to beat them, and they could not serve as witnesses in courts of law. At the same time, they had to be educated in a certain way and to know the literary language. Some even carried on friendships with poets and were accepted at court. If one takes into account the respect that was accorded to epic singers, the Bkharati, in India, the position of actors can be explained in historical terms. They did not arise from the class of professionals who would recount martial exploits but from the sphere of choral practices, as actors who would be summoned to take part in religious festivities. Such an explanation seems credible within the framework of the hypothesis of the dialectic native origins of Indian drama; when the Brahmins were present at the festivals of rural deities, at which Pariahs served, elements of native rites came under the protection of the religious establishment at the same time that the yoke of caste continued to burden their practitioners. This very issue of the social position of actors compels us now to turn to the beginnings of Roman drama, the flowering of which took place under the influence and in the footsteps of Greek drama. I have in mind those native beginnings which became entangled in external influences, whether real or legendary. Analogous phenomena in the history of drama as a whole will permit us to make some sense of this motley confusion. We have some knowledge about Roman religious activities involving drama, the holiday of Lupercalia, agrarian festivities, mimic representa tions, the blessing of the fields (ambarvalia), and so on. There were also choral activities with music, improvised songs, tales, and dancing with out an elaborated structure. The ancient satyr play {satura) shares the mood of the literary category of satire, which developed from it, just as the Greek elegy emerged from ritual lamentation. Between the satura and the Greco-Italian o?xvpoi there is neither an etymological nor a genetic link; one can consider only the possibility of later influence. We have posited all along that from choral activity arose songs of an amoebaean character, with satiric content, which long ago became a part of the grape gathering festival. It is said that songs like this, fescennine verses, were imported from the Etruscan city [Fescenina]. I am inclined to interpret this as meaning that they were able to become a coherent and popular genre and as such to exert an influence on forms which had already developed naturally as part of native choral poetry. Amoebaean poetics gave rise to dramatic effect and to types that were shown participating in everyday scenes. We're speaking here about the process of absorbing and making one's own another, more devel oped, tradition. In southern Italy, Greek and Osean choral activity gave</page><page sequence="7">FROM A HISTORICAL POETICS 415 rise to theatrical interludes with comic masks?the Atellan plays and mimes-?the traditions of which were carried far and wide by individual practitioners, the hilar?doi and mimodoi whom we have already encoun tered in tracing the roots of dramatic development. The Atellan and mime performances were carried over to Rome. The ceremonial origins of the first are clear: they were adapted to their new circumstances and spurred imitation, and as early as the Augustinian era they were being performed in the Osean language during cult festivities. With this material in hand we can turn to the testimony of Livy, who himself was drawing upon an ancient source about the beginnings of the Roman ludi scenici. They had a religious basis. We are told that, when a plague began in 364 B.C., priests, ludiones, were summoned from Etruria in order to placate the wrathful gods. They danced silently to the sounds of the flute, with graceful movements but without mimicry that would have expressed the content of the dance. This novelty proved popular: Roman youths began to imitate the new form of dance, adapting to it the principles of native amoebaean songs, interjecting poems in the style of fescennine verse, accompanying them with appropriate movements of the body. But the native players {vernaculis artificibus?they were called histrionics from the Etruscan word ister = ludius [player, actor] ) didn't stop at this. The random improvisation of fescennine verse was supplanted by the singing of a text suited to a background of flute music, and the movements of the dance-satire were subordinated to a fixed melody [...]. This is a page from the history of choral activity with which we are familiar: first, dancing of a ceremonial character with mimic actions, without words; then, the appearance of the text during the improvisation of fescennine verses; later, the singling out of the song-narrative, standardization of movement, and choral mimicry. Judg ing by the evidence provided by Livy, there was no storyline involved in all of this which would have tied together song and action into one coherent whole. Several stories and situations could be involved. We already know that representations of a number of everyday scenes emerged within the framework of dancing. The later connection of saturae with the Atellan plays can serve as indirect evidence that Atellan elements had existed within the satura. Livy breaks off his history of the satura at this point in order to turn to Livius Andronicus of Tarentum, who was the first representative of the Greek dramatic and theatrical tradition on Roman soil. It is said that he was the first to go against the tradition of disconnectedness which had characterized the saturae and to create a unified plot [...], which he sang alone, illustrating it also with gestures. It has been reported that when as a consequence he lost his voice he entrusted the singing to a boy, retaining the mimic role for himself. This may be only anecdotal</page><page sequence="8">416 NEW LITERARY HISTORY speculation; in the history of choral poetry we see solo singers who used gestures to illustrate the content of their songs, as well as the demarca tion of singing or music from mimicry. Andronicus could have carried over the tradition of the Greco-Italian hilar?dos. This found acceptance, according to Livy. Singers began providing accompaniment for the miming histrionics, who adopted strictly dialogical roles. This division of canticum [singing] and diverbia [speaking] was preserved in the makeup of Roman comedy. The innovations of Livius Andronicus turned out to be too serious, the historian continues, returning to the later history of the satura. They left no room for laughter and jollity, so Roman youths once again turned to the tradition of the fescennine verses and, having presented the histrionics with a new type of drama, continued as before to carry on their singing in the form of amusing improvisations [...] which adjoined the Atellans and were used as end pieces to bring things to a close? comic pieces which followed the serious dramas, as satiric drama had crowned the Greek trilogies. I alluded earlier to this connection with the Atellan plays, which elucidates the ancient composition and native theatrical elements of the saturae. The following can also serve as confirmation of these views. Drama was given to the histrionics. It was a new arrival?something foreign?and those who performed it, who were paid for their art, were without rights, infames [...]. The Atellan plays, on the other hand, were performed only by fully entitled Roman youths who enjoyed all the civil rights of members of the three Roman tribes and who had not forfeited the right to serve in the military. The Roman histrionics' lack of rights can be explained through analogy with the case of India. Unlike their Greek brethren, they had not passed through the sanctifying stage of cult practices. The particular social position of those who performed the Atellan plays (and the saturae) implies a forgotten tradition, the choral activity engaged in by members of a family and a people, a social group. In the Siberian bear festivities the actors performed of their own free will. The native beginnings of Roman drama, shorn of certain legends, thus becomes a part of the general picture of the evolution of drama. The Greek influence prevented it from maturing independently. We will take up the interrupted thread of our discussion on Greek soil. Here, the first steps are the clearest. Of course, we don't know how choral activity was conducted during this era of religious consciousness. We can resurrect it only through traces and hints, and by analogy with the zoomorphic character of the Siberian Bear Drama. When the Greek worldview came to encompass human-like gods, who resembled people though they were not always humane, and created tales about them that</page><page sequence="9">FROM A HISTORICAL POETICS 417 developed in pace with the civilization's social and ethical conscious ness, the content of cult drama, centered on myths (whether specific or general) that characterized the activities and essence of this or that deity, changed as well. Earlier we spoke about mimic dances with content of this sort; they were now joined by ceremonial activities of a cult nature. In Crete they depicted the birth of Zeus. On Samos, Knossos, Crete, and in Athens, they performed the marriage of Hera and Zeus. [...] In Tanagra, during the festival of Hermes, a boy who carried a lamb alongside the city walls portrayed the God himself. [...] In Delphi, on the first day of festivities, a young man dressed in a shimmering tunic as Apollo and playing on the cithara would sing of his victory over the Python, and this was represented with as much realism as possible. The next day the Dionysian myth about the revival of Semele was the subject of a mimic dance. On the next there was another dance, linked to the previous one by its content: the suicide of {Kharily}.3 The subjects of these performances proliferated because of the contiguity of these cults and the legends associated with them: Apollo and Dionysus in Delphi, Dionysus and Demeter in Eleusis. In this last case, the inner resemblance of the religious representations reinforced this phenomenon. Both involved an agricultural, calendar-based myth in the style of those that we examined in connection with the myth of Adonis. The fruitful power of nature dies down during the winter, only to be renewed again in the new life of spring; Dionysus suffers and dies in order to be reborn. Pluto deceives Kora-Persephone as she gathers flowers. The mournful Demeter searches for her daughter, who will again return to the earth in the spring. During the Greater Eleusinian Mysteries in Boedromion (September and October), the scenes of deception, searching, and return were performed collectively. We have little information about the Lesser Mysteries which took place during the Anthesteria in February and March, but obviously the npoxocpicrripia [preliminary festivities of thanksgiving] in the cult were an expression of gratitude for the return of Kora-Persephone from the kingdom of the dead. The shades of the dead returned to this world with her, tempo rarily reborn to put fear into the living. During festivities of this type, in which notions of life and death alternated with each other in various ways, periods of lamenting naturally shared ground with covert symbols of creative power and sexual enjoyment. This mutual influence of the Dionysian and the Eleusinian cults and activities is understandable. Dionysus-Bacchus played a role alongside Demeter and Persephone. They even made him into the son of Demeter. During the Mysteries, they represented his birth, collectively depicting the departure after the newborn, as in Delphi the hyades rocked the cradle of the baby Dionysus at the same time as the priests</page><page sequence="10">418 NEW LITERARY HISTORY brought sacrifices to his tomb. Life gave rise to death, which arose from life and returned to it. On the last night of the Greater Mysteries, amidst reverential silence, the Hierophant [the high priest] would exhibit to his mystae [the initiates, participants] a cut-off ear of corn. This symbol ized the central idea of the agricultural myth, inevitably carried over into the phenomena of social and personal life, where that same alteration of rise and fall, of equally undeserved suffering and celebration, could not assuage feelings about the harshness of the natural process, but rather raised pressing questions about the significance of mankind, about predestination and personal responsibility, and about the possibility of reconciling such contradictions and creating an equilibrium in one's consciousness, in life beyond the grave. The esoteric secrets of Eleusis, accessible only to initiates, attempted to provide an answer to these questions, symbolically elucidating the ideas of good and evil, guilt and retribution. Neophytes entered a region of darkness and quiet, dis turbed at times by frightening sounds or the sight of the hellish monsters and sufferings awaiting sinners. Then the darkness would be filled with bright sunlight and the initiates would bow their heads to the shining faces of the gods. The esoteric teachings of the Mysteries led to generalizing the contents of myth. The ideas of Providence and duty, of fate and responsibility, transformed its content and subjects, and a drama of spiritual conflicts was discovered in it. All of our intentions, decisions, and passions are inspired by the gods, according to such legendary belief. It was Apollo who directed the hand of Orestes against his mother. The erinyes pursue the matricide, who must suffer. Phaedra falls in love with her stepson, incited by Aphrodite, who has chosen her as a weapon of revenge against Hippolytus, and we sympathize with Phaedra. Kinship, which calls for kindred responsibility and for vengeance for wrongs inflicted through the generations, has been transformed into the idea of kindred guilt to be atoned for by subsequent generations. This fate hanging over the heads of the innocent, though, is presented to us through the conflict of predestination and free will, ancestral and personal morality. This tragic sensibility is reflected clearly in the representations of Oedipus, Antigone, Prometheus, and Orestes. The idea of kindred responsibility is then transferred into the national political arena, so that the fate of the Persians in the drama of Aeschylus is decided by their fatal lack of culture. If the development of the artistic drama of Attica adjoined cult and the native ritualistic activities associated with Dionysus, then it is perhaps worthwhile to recall that the legends about him, with their sharply defined motifs of suffering and rejoicing, with their "play of the creation and disruption of the individual's world" (Nietzsche), provided a range</page><page sequence="11">FROM A HISTORICAL POETICS 419 of subjects which were appropriate for drama and which lent themselves to psychological generalization. Dionysus was the God of the creative force of nature, messenger of fruitfulness, giver of the vine. Each day the holy vine on one of the summits of Kithaeron would bring forth a ripe fruit. Hence the epithets of the God: Sevopivq?, GtaipvXivq? [wooden, of the grape-vine], and others. One of his symbols was the phallus. The goat and the bull were dedicated to him. He himself turned into a goat in order to escape the persecution of Hera. They called him ?pi&lt;pio? [goatish]. The goatish faces of the satyrs, obviously, arose during the time when people honored him through mime, adopting his countenance. The way in which primitive peoples disguised themselves as animals in their games sheds light on this forgotten period of Dionysian drama, as well as the influence of ceremonial rituals on myth. The disguised satyrs featured in the myth as the servants, the retinue, of Dionysus, while the maenads and hyades may have originally indicated women who raucously, madly, served in the festivities. But his favorite representation and symbol was the bull. Hence the nicknames ?ovyevr\c, ?orjXarqc [fathered by a bull, driver of bulls]. In Argos they would summon him with a prayer: "Come, Dionysus, with the charites. Enter the temple with your bull's foot, glorious bull!" He sometimes adopts the bull's countenance in order to frighten, they depict him as a bull, and small horns remain one of his attributes in later anthropomorphic representations. A bull was the usual sacrifice to him, one of the prizes to the winner at the Dionysian poetic competitions. But the God of productivity and the force of life is persecuted and perishes. Liknites drives away those who feed him, and he flings himself into the ocean, to Thebes, or seeks safe haven among the Muses. Perseus kills him and throws him into the sea, or the Titans tear him apart when, after many transformations, he has taken on the semblance of a bull. This last well-known myth clearly derives from ceremonial rite. Accord ing to the testimony of Euripides, part of the Dionysian ceremony involved the custom of tearing bulls and calves into pieces and devour ing them alive. On Crete they tore apart a bull in memory of the god's similar fate. A Tenedosian custom adds new features in the evolution of this religious worldview. They would look after a pregnant cow, tending her as they would a woman who was to give birth. Her calf would be clothed in a buskin and sacrificed?an indication that the sacrifice of a beast was to replace that of a human (which was practiced in Chios and Orchomenos). The following fact is also interesting: they would drive the man who had killed the calf to the edge of the sea, pelting him with stones along the way. When the mimic ceremony transmuted into a ceremony of cult, of religion, the deity immanent in the imitative action</page><page sequence="12">420 NEW LITERARY HISTORY stood out more clearly as its object. The sacrifice was unavoidable, but those who perpetrated it were persecuted. This is true of the southern Indian agrarian festival from which an episode was taken earlier. One of the participants, bearing the name of the God whom he served, {Potrai}, would hypnotize a calf, making several passes over him with his hands, after which the calf would stand motionless. Then others would bind his hands behind his back and everyone would dance over him, letting out loud screams. He would succumb to the general frenzy and fall upon the hypnotized calf, biting into its throat with his teeth and tearing it apart. He would be served a dish of the sacrificial meat, in which he would immerse his face. The meat and remnants of the calf would be left by the altar, while his hands would be freed and he would run away. Before such mystic-cult activity came to involve a sacrifice presented to the divinity, the identity of both former and latter were expressed in other forms. A zoomorphic god would be sacrificed so that practitioners could commune with his life force, with his blood. The tales about the maenads, who would tear apart beasts and men in a divine frenzy, are intelligible in this light. When the grape and wine, which had not yet, it is conjectured, played a role in the ancient Dionysian cult, entered its symbolic purview, wine may have taken the place of blood. This is the gift of Dionysus to men. During the springtime Dionysian festivities, there would be funeral feasts for the dead. Participants may have believed that the dead were returning to life, associating wine with blood. The original ideas about the erinyes, souls thirsting for human blood, may have been similar. In a legend of the Middle Ages, wine is the blood of Bacchus, the grape saint, tortured on the grindstone. Dionysus, for now, is in the kingdom of Hades with the maenads, but he will return from that world and be reborn. In Argos they summon him, the bull's kin, from the waters of Lerna with the sounds of horns. When the Titans tore him apart and ate him, Zeus was able to swallow his heart, which he gave to Semele. From this heart, Dionysus-Zagreus will be reborn. The little one is nurtured and with his return to the earth nature revives miraculously. The valleys flow with milk and honey, honey oozes from the thyrsi of the maenads, springs of water and wine open in the earth from their blows. The maenads come back to life. Everyone communes with Dionysus, he is everywhere, metamorphizing into the likeness of a lion, a bull, a panther, and so forth?symbols of his ubiquity in nature. He rules without restriction. No one thinks to escape his inspiration, this mysterious force that gives self-awareness to life and brings joyous enthusiasm which spurs a frenzy that the generous god sanctifies. This is the first meaning of catharsis. But he also visits it upon those who would oppose his power. The sensation of springtime is irresistible. In Euripides, Pentheus speaks about the unruliness of the</page><page sequence="13">FROM A HISTORICAL POETICS 421 maenads, just as the critics of the Middle Ages spoke of the extremities of the May revelries. This, perhaps, was the physical and psychological mood that corresponded to these festivals of the calendar year; trans planted onto historic soil, they became a part of the myths about the god who sentenced his persecutors to such mania. Such are the legends about Dionysus as they accrued on the basis of more ancient agrarian cults and in proximity with the cult of Eleusis. These are myths about a god who is reborn and dies each year, giving rise to calendar festivals at the appropriate times, festivals which lend insight into each other. Accommodating Dionysus to the cult of wine and wine-growing changed only the timing of the calendar of his rebirth and death. It is of no consequence whether the ancient days of Dionysus (December and January) and those of Lenaeus (which followed in January and February) corresponded to the gathering of the grapes, which wouldn't accord with the season, or to a celebration of the young wine. The mimic activity of the ceremony generalized from the symbolic essence of the god and could do so retrospectively as, in the opposite sense, our Christmas-time processions with a plow mimic the agrarian activities of spring. During the winter festivities Dionysus is represented at the height of his life-giving powers; he is full of inexhaustible force, which pours forth all around him. The wine emerges from the groaning grindstones, bringing joy and happiness to people. Yet new sufferings and death are kept in mind as well, for the usual cycle will occur. The expectation of this tragic time is linked with the moment of celebration. This dual mood is reflected in the character of the festivities. We can identify two groups among the participants: the practitioners of the ceremonial activities around which the cult centered and the public, a crowd of enthusiastic worshippers. The former carry on the ancient mimic activities. They are the satyrs, disguised in imitation of the god when he still appeared in the likeness of a beast. The chorus dances and sings a dithyramb with the costumed satyrs. It is an ancient native song in honor of Dionysus, the passion and pathos of which leads first to feverish gaity among the unbridled dancers, then to representations of sorrow and death. As the chorus circles around the altar, the choregos tells of the trials and sufferings of Dionysus, of others who lived in his age, and of mythological heroes whose stories are linked with his own (for example Adrastus). The subject matter of future tragedies originated in this way. The choregos began to represent the god or a hero, or at least answered him, singing along, establishing a dialogue. One can imagine an interchange between two choruses as part of the ceremony, apparently an innovation of {Lazos}. The role of the enthusiasts who were not practitioners of the cult was</page><page sequence="14">422 NEW LITERARY HISTORY different. They joined wholeheartedly in the moments of unbridled gaiety, rather than the more somber aspects of the festival. For them, Dionysus was the god of life and health. Sitting in the carriages which the peasants used to carry the wine, they cast down jokes and witticisms upon the onlookers during the processions of both Lenaeus and the Anthesteria. We already know of parallels to this free participation of the crowd in cult drama. Take for example the K?fio? [cornus]. This was an inebriated crowd which loudly accompanied the procession of the phallus with appropriate songs, r? (paXXiic?, detaining passersby along the road, stopping sometimes in order to put on some sort of improvised comic scene. The actors are the phallaphoroi of Dionysus. The Thebans call them ???Xovxa? (enthusiasts) [...]. The element of costume, inherited from the ceremonial imitation of the countenance of the god, actually developed and deepened under these circumstances. Participants would rub their faces with the dregs of the wine. They dyed themselves with white, black, and red. They wore costumes. They fashioned themselves beards from leaves. They wore masks of wood and bark, the faces of beasts. These were traces of the mimic activity which lived on among uncultured peoples. The Attic Anthesteria, which was celebrated in the spring (February and March) over the course of three days, adjoined the winter Dionysian cycle. One may infer its "rural" content. The god of wine and merriment celebrates for now, but soon he will die. The grain, John Barleycorn, must go into the ground. Dionysus must descend to the underworld. Hence, the new alternation of wedding images with the rites of funeral feasts. Kegs of old wine would be opened (hence the name of the first day of the Anthesteria: Tliodiyia). The hosts would sacrifice to Dionysus. They and their domestic retainers would take part in libations, which on the following day would assume the character of contests, the winners of which were awarded prizes. This served, as it were, as an introduction to the following holiday, X?eg. Dionysus again returns to life. The day before they have carried his statue from the temple of Lenaeus to the Kerameikos, and now they return with it in a triumphant procession, the participants of which are disguised in masks as horae, nymphs, bacchante. Joyous screams and satiric comments can be heard from the carriages which accompany the procession. In the temple, Dionysus is betrothed to the wife of the second archon. She has administered an oath to fourteen women, who have sworn that they are virgins and that they will serve the god as their forefathers did. These are the brides of Dionysus. But then the arrivals from that other world appear, the keres, and people are afraid of them. They wander amongst the people, who strive to keep them away with the plant polygonum aviculare or by smearing their doors with tar, during the course of juiapai i)/i?pai (the unclean days). We may</page><page sequence="15">FROM A HISTORICAL POETICS 423 recall an analogous feature of the Eleusinian mysteries. Libations of wine were poured out to the spirits and to Dionysus, trapped beneath the ground. The custom of chasing one drink with another has its origin here. In the evening, participants in the funeral feast carried their cups, entwined in twigs, to the temple of Lenaeus. There they entrusted the twigs to the priest and poured out the wine which remained in their cups in honor of Dionysus. The last day of the holiday, Xvrpoi Tlavcmp\iia, during which they ate a dish of boiled grains, was wholly devoted to funeral feasts dedicated to the deceased, culminating in their banishment. "Be off, Iwres, an end to the Anthesteria," they cry after them. "There's no room for them among the living." In the same way, seeing offspring, we drive off the mermaids. There were also poetic competitions during the holiday of Chytroi? the Xvrpivoi ay ve??the contents of which we do not know. Although there were many dramatic elements in the practices of Chytroi, general consensus is that the birth of drama relates not to them but to the practices of the ancient festivals of Dionysus and Lenaeus. The festivals of Dionysus in the cities (March and April) molded the inheritance of cult and ceremony into more artistic form. Again, I will focus upon one difference which, it seems to me, is crucial for analyzing the history of drama. According to Aristotle, tragedy arose from the dithyramb, from the ?no r v ??apxovr v tov ?iOvpap?ov. This was the chorus, or choruses, which circled around the sacrificial altar of Dionysus, singing the song of the cult, elucidating the circumstances and identities of the participants in the tragedy. The section in the orchestra where the choruses completed their evolution continued to be called dv^i?X?], the altar. The "satyr" drama* which followed the tragedy, coming after the trilogy, retained the name and the masks of the cult performers of the ancient dithyramb. The joyous and the serious were divided between it and the tragedy. The amoebaean principal of alternating choruses expressed itself also in the two halves of the chorus and in the custom of the agon, a competition of tragedies or trilogies. The issue of the artistic metamorphosis of the composition of the chorus is more important. We know that the main role in the perform ance of the dithyramb was played by the choregos. He initiated it and introduced new content into it. The actor Thespis originally played this role. They say that Thespis invented npoX?yov Kai pr\aw [the prologue and speech]. The prologue is meant, obviously, for a single actor. This can be confirmed by analogous facts from the overall history of the development of choral activities and begs a question: is it true that the prologue of a Greek tragedy was first voiced by the entire chorus and not by a single actor, as in Agamemnon, Choephoroi, and in Eumenides? With</page><page sequence="16">424 NEW LITERARY HISTORY the isolation of the choregos, the text of his speech, as well, must have abandoned the caprices of improvisation in favor of stable forms. The introduction of a clearly defined plot is attributed to Livius Andronicus. Apparently, the [speech] of Thespis has the same significance. The three masks, in which the actor appears successively, represent both a legacy of the old mimetic ceremonies and also a transitional step toward the two actors of Aeschylus (in Agamemnon, Choephoroi, and Eumenides, we already have three actors), and toward the three performers of Sophocles. Notwithstanding this, even in the era of cult activity one can imagine not just one, but several, authoritative roles in the person of the precentor and his assistants, and of two choruses in the case of the choragi. The dithyrambic chorus took up the song of the choregos, established a dialogue, and elaborated upon the plot. The choregos answered. The actor in tragedy was VKOKpirric, "the answering one." The introductory scene of Prometheus Bound develops through the alternation of actor and chorus; the scenic structure of the tragedy is based upon the dialogues of chorus and actors between themselves. Yet the chorus of the dithyramb was limited to the refrain, from which the lyric roles of the tragic chorus emerged. Its ar?aifia [stasima] must have been born from the inter changes of two choruses in song. The strophes and antistrophes which followed one another often took one another up, not only through the parallelism of content and ideas, as in Sophocles, but also through the repetition of the words and images of the original rhyme (anastrophe), as in Aeschylus. [...] ("Xerxes has gone?alas! / Xerxes has perished? alas! / Xerxes plans have gone awry. / They have taken the boats away? alas! / The boats have perished?alas! / The boats, with crushing blows.") We see exactly [such couplets] in the old French epos, emerging from the interchange and development of other singers' words as a [refrain] in the parados of Agamemnon in three strophes ("Flow on, oh mournful tune, but victory will go to the good!"). This was a legacy, perhaps, of the forms of the ancient dithyrambic refrain. The role of the chorus in tragedy gradually decreased as the scenic action on the stage became predominant, eventually diverging so widely from its ancient meaning in the dithyramb that it had to be explained anew. Horace's "Epistle to the Pisons" still cleaves to some ancient source when he demands that the chorus take part in the action. For Aristotle, the actors represent the heroes, while the chorus represents the people, those who observe. A. V. Shlegel calls it "the ideal observer," while others have considered it to be the representative of social conscience, voicing a moral evaluation of persons embedded in events (the outcome of which it foresees), generalizing about the contradictory nature of fate and free will in order to explain and reconcile them. For</page><page sequence="17">FROM A HISTORICAL POETICS 425 Nietzsche, the chorus is a symbol of the entire mass of people who are roused by Dionysus. This is how the conception of an actual Dionysian catharsis drew inspiration. The chorus of the dithyramb was idealized and its ceremo nial masks were allocated specific roles in the masks of artistic tragedy. The very same process took place in the area of its subject matter, which even within the borders of the dithyramb expanded beyond the bound aries of Dionysian myth. This corresponded to a new set of conceptions, also idealized. I will turn to one example. During the festival of X?eg [Choes], there were libations to the deceased, who would reveal them selves: among them were the "birth mothers" who governed the fate of their kin and those who visited it upon them and cruelly punished those who broke ancestral rules: the keres and erinyes. A common libation was drunk in honor of man, but in such way that each drank separately, after which everyone carried his goblet to the temple of Dionysus. This was done, apparently, in memory of Orestes, who had been isolated from his fellow men because of his act of matricide, banned from the temples until the god would forgive him and cleanse him of his involuntary sin. It was involuntary because Apollo had forced him to lay hands upon his mother, the murderess of his father. But the mother's kin, the manes and erinyes, avenged her, fighting for her sacred rights. This myth expressed underlying cultural relationships in which the ancient matriarchy struggled against the patriarchy, which was establishing a new order. The role of this myth and of the Dionysian cult can be explained through the connection of Dionysus with the chthonic myth. It served as one subject of the dithyramb and in Aeschylus it manifests itself in the brilliance of the tragic catharsis. Artistic drama took form as it preserved, and at the same time refashioned, both its own cult forms and the subject matter of myth. The reworking of the epic legacy and the growth of the personal artistic lyric could not avoid being reflected in it, but this form of drama was not a new organism, not a mechanical fusion of epic and lyric elements, but the evolutionary product of an ancient syncretic structure, solidified by cult and successively incorporating the results of social and poetic evolution. Its freedom in treating religious legend and its capaciousness were conditions of its artistic flowering. These were absent as the liturgical drama of the Middle Ages evolved into mystery plays, for in that case the religious inheritance was considered inviolable. Drama separated itself from church ritual and moved out into the square without gaining the same relationship that tragedy had to the dithyramb of the ancient Dionysian festivals. Comedy's fate was different, because its source was different. It</page><page sequence="18">426 NEW LITERARY HISTORY emerged, according to Aristotle, from the phallic songs which were part of the rural Dionysian festivals, ?no x v ??apxovzcov ra ?aXXiKa [from the precentors of the phallic songs]. If one understands the ??apxc?v [the leading into song] in the sense in which we speak about the "lead in" to the dithyramb, then one can suppose that the embryo of comedy is to be found in the comic scenes of the comus. There, a figure in disguise would amuse by mimicking his neighbor, representing types? for example a loquacious old man driving his grumbling home with blows of a stick (Aristophanes, Clouds?parabasis), a drunkard, and so on, thereby evoking the laughter and merry interference of onlookers. In such scenes, which inevitably adopted an amoebaean character, there was essentially nothing religious, Dionysian, aside from gaiety. No altar, no cult activity, no traditional satyrs, none of the content of myth. They were able to come into being and did so outside the Dionysian sphere as well, as in the south Italian mimes and Atellans with their literary and native inheritance. Comedy emerges from the imitative ritual chorus, independent of cult forms. It has its own situations and real types, not the demarcated subjects of myth, with its idealized images. These situations and types will then be unified by a theme (drawn from life, from humorous tales, from the realm of fantasy) with choruses in beast masks, with types marked by caricature, importunately frank. In this, they echo the phallic songs heard from the carriages of the Dionysian festivals, with their equally unabashed satire of personalities and the social order. The comedy of Aristophanes, in essence, is a comedy of types, caricature, and satire. Tragedy lent it its own artistically developed forms, without having mastered comedy's formal incoherence. There were also lyric songs, which were capriciously thrown into the mix, as well as the enigmatic parabasis, with the amoebaean strophes and the narration of the choregos, which interrupted the action and did not share an organic connection with it. And let us not forget the agon of Greek comedy?competition similar to that of Xoyo? SiKaio? Kai aSixo? [Truth and Falsehood] (Aristophanes), and so forth?the legacy of the amoebaean scenes of the comus. In the "new" comedy, these rough spots were smoothed out. It abandoned coarse caricature for the depiction of social mores, reflecting in this respect the late evolution of tragedy, when heroic types gave way in Euripides to the norms of simple humanity and its psychology. The idealization of man began at the altar and was perfected in the spheres of heroism raised above reality. This was the origin of the types who would then be measured against life and used in the evaluation of real-life relationships and phenomena. In this sense, one can say that the forms of tragedy that emerged from cult</page><page sequence="19">FROM A HISTORICAL POETICS 427 raised comedy from the level of everyday caricature into a realm of general artistic statement. I will try to indicate several conclusions. At the beginning we see rhythmic and musical syncretism, with the gradual development of a verbal component, text, and the psychological and rhythmic foundations of a stylistics. Choral activity is associated with ceremonial ritual. Songs of a lyric-epic character appear as the first real development out of this connection of choir and ritual. They evolve in the hands of professional singers, within the familiar conditions of princely, martial life, into epic songs; these form cycles, are rehearsed, and sometimes attain true epic form. At the same time, the poetry of the choral ritual continues to exist, either assuming or eschewing stable features of cult. The lyric elements of choral and lyric-epic song are initially restricted to groups of short representational formulae, and they are sung both separately and together, satisfying the most basic requirements of emotionality. In cases in which these elements begin to serve to express more complicated and individual feelings, one can posit an underlying cultural-social differentiation, more limited in scope but more intensive in terms of content, than that which inspired the epic's self-isolation. The artistic lyric came later. At this point in the evolutionary process, previous stages are still present: ceremonial and cult choral practice, epic poetry and epos, and cult drama. The organic demarcation of artistic drama from cult drama demanded, apparently, conditions which occurred only at one time in Greece, which does not allow one to conclude that this stage of evolution was necessarily inevitable. All of this took place with an admixture of outside influences and interference as innovation unintentionally occurred within old forms. Imitations appeared as well, and examples of the artistic epos, the lyric, and drama appeared in each separate sphere, as happened in Greece and Rome. Their forms became prescriptive, the poetics of Aristotle and Horace declared them to be classical, and we lived for a long time on this wealth, comparing everything to Homer, Virgil, Pindar, Seneca, and the Greek tragedians. Poetic discoveries which Aristotle had not fore seen fit poorly into his framework. Shakespeare and the Romantics made a large breach. The Romantics and the school of the Brothers Grimm opened a realm, previously untouched, of national song and saga and Karrer, Wakkernagel, and others flung wide open the doors of the old baronial retreat, where new guests had felt unwelcome. Then the ethnographers and folklorists appeared. Materials for comparative liter ary study have expanded so much that new types of knowledge are</page><page sequence="20">428 NEW LITERARY HISTORY required, a poetics of the future. This poetics will not undertake to restrict our tastes narrowly, but will leave our old gods on Olympus, having reconciled Corneille and Shakespeare in a broad historical synthesis. It will teach us that there is something of a natural order, worked out by a social and psychological process, in the forms of poetry we have inherited, that the poetry of language cannot be defined by an abstract understanding of beauty, and that it is eternally recreated in a recurrent combination of these forms with the natural evolution of social ideals; that we all participate in this process, and that among us there are men who are capable of capturing these stages in forms which we call poetic. We call these men poets. Translated by Ian M. Helfant Colgate University TRANSLATOR'S NOTES 1 Translated from A. N. Veselovskii, Istoricheskaia Poetika, ed. L. A.
