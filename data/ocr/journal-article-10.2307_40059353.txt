<plain_text><page sequence="1">MR. BLACKMUR'S LOWELL: HOW DOES MORALITY GET INTO LITERATURE? Sue Mitchell Crowley When the late Robert Lowell published his Notebook, 1967-68, he included a poem called "Playing Ball with the Critic (for Richard Blackmur)" which clearly demonstrates how deeply, even twenty-five years after the fact, Lowell felt Blackmur's negative review of his first volume of poems, Land of Unlikeness . The young boys, he writes, learn early on to smile and kick the ball to the policeman so he may smile and kick it back: "where else can we learn to duck and block the kick?" (55). Lowell's metaphor displays his sense of his relation to the nor- mative eminence of R. P. Blackmur. Lowell in his poem quotes Black- mur's castigating remarks in the 1945 review, "Notes on Seven Poets" {Language 361-63): "Is it a form of a force, or a sentiment of a form? His logic lacerates his vision, vision turns his logic to zealotry," or "In his first, best, book, no poem offers a logical evaluation." And Lowell concludes, "still it's a privilege to earn the bullring." For a number of years Blackmur was considered by many to be the greatest living American critic, and Lowell the greatest living American poet. Lowell's own sense of this state of things must have been particularly painful since Blackmur was not only a long-time friend (even a house guest at Damariscotta) but a member of the New Critical school of poet-critics who were, in a sense, Lowell's fathers.1 If Blackmur's initial assessment hurt him, one must hope that he did not discover the critic's final (1961) judgment, well hidden in a R&amp;L 19.3 (Autumn 1987) 27</page><page sequence="2">28 Religion &amp; Literature reference volume, Religion in American Life. After having striven to follow Blackmur's first advice to unify sentiment and form, Lowell would have discovered Blackmur's judgment that his sensibility was "drenching" his conceits and standing as a "road barrier" within his verse ("Reli- gious Poetry" 280). Blackmur once more admitted Lowell to the bull- ring, this time as the representative religious poet of his generation, but only to gore him again. However, though Blackmur failed in his duty to Lowell, he has bequeathed to us a body of literary theory and a language to do the poet justice. Of all the many forms of criticism available today, that of Blackmur is - in the breadth of its demand that we relate the work to the man and the culture from which it pro- ceeds, and that we discover the way in which the larger reality informs a work of art - most eminently suited to the study of Robert Lowell. And though Lowell suffered from the barbs of that particular matador, he has left us in his finest work a poetry worthy of the criticism of R. P. Blackmur. It may seem a pretentious, even contrary, enterprise to read Lowell now according to Blackmur in a way Blackmur never did, but that is the purpose of this essay. Particularly in this era when so much Lowell criticism seems almost to derive from the Ian Hamilton biography, Blackmur's understanding of behavior and its role in literature may offer a critical mode that is at once more broadly tolerant of the poet in the act of making poetry and more respectful of the poem as a discrete entity. In such a reading I hope to achieve several ends: first, to show that, while Blackmur was quite correct in his first assessment of Land of Unlikeness , these earliest, unsuccessful religious poems already con- tained a passion that would one day discover its true form and become the authentic voice of Robert Lowell, a moral voice which Blackmur all but ignored; second, to offer a new reading of Lowell's often misread "Beyond the Alps" as a poem in which form and thought are unified, a poem at once public and deeply personal, and above all moral in just that sense in which Blackmur uses the term; and finally, to see the poem as pivotal in Lowell's career, encompassing both religion and morality as they relate to each other; to see it not only as one of his greatest poems, but as a suitable touchstone for evaluating Lowell's work, as he did, as one poem.2 Like Whitman and Eliot before him, he saw his work as the poem that was his life. And his moral vision, while it often failed in his personal life, is a driving force in his poetry. Blackmur's first review finds the formal elements of the verse separable from its meaning: "It is as if [Lowell] demanded to know (to judge, to master) both the substance apart from the form with which</page><page sequence="3">SUE MITCHELL CROWLEY 29 he handles it, and the form apart from the substance handled in order to set them fighting" {Language 362). Blackmur attributes this flaw to the fact that "Lowell is distraught about his religion; he does not seem to have decided whether his Roman Catholic belief is the form of a force or the sentiment of a form." As a result, he believes that "in deal- ing with men [Lowell's] faith compels him to be fractiously vindictive," at the same time that his experience of humanity compels him to be "nearly blasphemous" in dealing with his faith. Blackmur contrasts Lowell's failure with the achievement of Dante, who loved both men and his world, and so wrote in "loving meters." In Lowell's poems, on the other hand, he finds "not a loving meter in the book," not a ten- sion of elements, but what he calls "a gritting." Blackmur does not con- demn Lowell's rage at the fallen world but rather his failure "to find in verse a tension of necessity" which has "the quality of conflict accepted, not hated." Blackmur holds that "to put a thing, or a quality, or an intimation, in verse" is the same as for the man who is not a poet to hold "a thing in mind." Mind and verse are the mediums of response to the real world. But in the "land of unlikeness," Saint Bernard says, "when the soul has lost its likeness to God, it is no longer like itself" (quoted on the title page oi Land of Unlikeness). Blackmur suggests that the dichotomy of self and world implicit in Lowell's title is actual in Lowell himself. He can express only the violence of his problem, and so "logic lacerates the vision and vision turns logic to zealotry" (Language 363). The single poem Blackmur chooses to cite, describing it as the "best managed," is "The Drunken Fisherman," which echoes the religious themes of T. S. Eliot in its wasteland and fisher-king imagery. Though Blackmur never tells us why it is the best managed, and it is certainly as fraught with "gritting" as the other pieces, one may suspect it is be- cause of that imagery. Lowell reprinted the poem in his 1977 Selected Poems - perhaps because it merited Blackmur's even grudging approval. Many of the poems in Land of Unlikeness and Lord Weary's Castle seem to be highly imitative of Eliot. Lowell's use of Saint Stephen, proto- martyr, as the kingfisher in "Colloquy in Black Rock" {Poems 1938-49 15) is but one example. In a 1967 letter Lowell, remembering his previous avowal that Eliot couldn't be imitated, writes to the contrary: "I read Lord Weary and found it studded with Eliot. He meant much to me personally . . . more than any of the poets" (Cooper 42). Lowell, however unconsciously, invited comparison with Eliot in his earliest volumes. Though Blackmur never says so, it is possible that Lowell suffers from first to last in the critic's mind because he is not T. S. Eliot.</page><page sequence="4">30 Religion &amp; Literature However justified Blackmur's criticism is in relation to Land of Unlikeness , it misses the point in assessing Lowell's subsequent work. And if Black- mur does silently demand that Lowell measure up as Eliot's heir, this fact points to a continuing flaw in Blackmur's criticism. He decries a number of writers for not being Dante or Shakespeare or Dostoevsky. Not only Blackmur but Lowell himself gives evidence of having com- pared his work to Eliot's. Where Lowell fails in his first poems, as Blackmur so rightly senses, is on the score on which he praises Eliot. In 1961, he explains to Frederick Seidel: "I feel Eliot's real all through the Quartets. He can be very intelligent or very simple there, and he's there. ..." {Prose 265). Lowell had discovered himself as poet in the high church world of Eliot and Allen Tate. Lowell recalls that in the year of his conversion, 1940, he was "more interested in being a Cath- olic than in being a writer." He continues, however: "I won't say the Catholicism gave me subject matter, but it gave me some kind of form, and I could begin a poem and build it to a climax" (258). But Lowell remembers also that in Lord Wearys Castle, for which he won the 1947 Pulitzer prize, he collected only a third of these earlier poems from Land of Unlikeness, the ones he saw as more concrete, as having less symbolic imagery. As if he had taken Blackmur's advice to heart, Lowell recalls, "There seemed to be too much twisting and disgust in the first book." After pondering whether these poems are religious or whether they merely employ religious imagery, he concludes, "I haven't really any idea" (250). One can, then, measure Lowell by Blackmur's standards more pre- cisely if one considers the critic's 1935 essay on the relationship of re- ligion and literature, "T. S. Eliot: From 'Ash Wednesday' to Murder in the CathedraT {Language 163-91). Blackmur is interested in the operative advantage an objective religion grants to poetry. But he states flatly that poetry is not religion and that poetry alone can never satisfy the aspirations of religion. He sees the Church as crucial, however, in Eliot's poetry, as a force "guiding the apprehensions and feeling of the real world. The facts of religion enlighten the facts of the actual, from which they are believed to spring" (167). He is concerned not with devotional verse, but with that poetry which is "penetrated and animated and its significance determined by Christian feeling and especially by the Chris- tian distinction of Good and Evil" (168). The technical devices employed by the poetic imagination bring Christian belief to actuality. The mere presence of Christianity does not make a poem good; the poetry itself must be good (175). And religion is only one of the particles in that larger suffusing element which Blackmur calls "personality" (176). It</page><page sequence="5">SUE MITCHELL CROWLEY 31 is Eliot's great gift that his convictions confirm a form for the feeling of his faith. Like Shakespeare, he is himself the unity of his work, and "Christianity is the emphatic form his sensibility fills" (180). Eliot's images seize enough of the "life lived, the death seen, to give the emo- tion of the actuality of the rest." Blackmur senses that Lowell's real per- sonality, on the other hand, is not informing his verse. Or perhaps the failure Blackmur describes is the mark of a poet not yet mature, a poet without enough of the life lived and the death seen. Unlike Eliot, Lowell is as yet unable to "redeem the time." One may contend, however, that this unity of personality and historical-mythical structure does find its true poetic form in Lowell's finest work: first, perhaps, in "The Quaker Graveyard in Nantucket," and ultimately in the major poems of Life Studies and For the Union Dead. As we will see, Lowell's own theoretical conception of poetry is almost identical with Blackmur's, and Lowell's greatest works embody this theory. Thus it is difficult to account for Blackmur's attitude toward the poet in "Religious Poetry in The United States." One wonders if perhaps Blackmur in 1961 , within four years of his own death, simply failed to read some of these major Lowell poems.3 Blackmur's essay is a very exciting overview of religious poetry in America from Anne Bradstreet to the present. He appropriately selects Lowell as a represen- tative of what he sees as the major strain in that tradition, the poets who, like Jacob, wrestle with God and "with the self, with the con- science, and above all in our latter day with our behavior" (280). But when summing up Lowell as one who "wrestles - or behavior wrestles - against the conscience of faith as revealed to him at the moment," Blackmur's assessment errs in finding no integrity, no authenticity in such a struggle. He seems to be locked in his original opinion of Lowell's first volume. And if it were not enough to be compared to Dante and Eliot, Lowell is here made parallel with Edward Taylor, and of course again fails to measure up. In Taylor's verse the concrete is the mean- ing of the sensibility; in Lowell's, sensibility "drenches" the conceits and becomes the meaning itself. And so Blackmur, using Reinhold Niebuhr's phrase, dismisses Lowell as a "post-Christian Christian": One can imagine Lowell repeating the remark in Gide: God woos us by His calamities, and that is how He shows His love for us; but we cannot imagine Lowell repeating what Taylor heard as "Christ's Reply" to "The Souls Groan to Christ for Succor," for it would have done this latter-day or post-Christian Christian no good. For Blackmur, Lowell - like Lepke - has lost his connections; and the absolute religious difference makes an absolute poetic difference.</page><page sequence="6">32 Religion &amp; Literature However, the mode for discovering the real unity of Lowell's work may lie within the very terms of these and other Blackmur essays. In- herent in this criticism are the methods to praise Lowell as well as bury him. We may evaluate Lowell's poetry according to Blackmur's con- ception of the way religion inheres in a work of art. Further, and, perhaps even more importantly, we must consider Lowell by asking Blackmur's own question in "Between the Numen and the Moha": "How does morality get into a poem?" {Lion 289-309). The critic offers two answers. He describes the "reason" that is the poem as the condition lying between the spirit that inspires us, the Numen, and the horror that results from the ignorance of man, the Moha (the Sanskrit word for cow). Here the Christian distinction between good and evil, as it is implied in the subject matter, plays a crucial part in creating a moral tension "in verse." An earlier essay, "The Shorter Poems of Thomas Hardy," offers a far more complex, as well as more characteristically Blackmurian answer, one that is concerned with the very nature of the poetic process, and one that addresses the issues Blackmur raised concerning Lowell. True morality inheres in that invoked rhythm which is not mere meter, but which may be felt "beating mutually in thought and feeling and syllable, of the whole poem" {Language 78). This rhythm, this passion, is the great enacting agent of literature: it turns the per- sonal and the private into an impersonal and universal statement. It is felt when the subject matter is informed by a sensibility which has discerned an appropriate language. In Lowell's early poems the Bernardian sense of "unlikeness" fails to find an appropriate form, a meter to evoke the passion of his sense of incommensurability, and results rather in what Blackmur terms "grit- ting," an inability to love his world as Dante did. At what point, then, in his career does Lowell achieve a unity of his religious-moral sense with an appropriate rhythm? Before addressing "Beyond the Alps" it would be well to consider one poem from Land of Unlikeness and one from Lord Weary s Castle, not only because all three poems share the same religious imagery and moral concerns, but because taken together they show both continuity and development in Lowell's poetic power. His first book is a collection of religious poems about war. Richard Fein explains that in those poems war becomes "the immoral equivalent of religion, a weird mirror image of Christianity, yet in its very perversion of Christian experience the war affirms the significance of the energies disciplined and expressed in Christianity" (820). This repeated theme Blackmur would term Lowell's "formula" {Language 63). Openly imitative of the paradoxical</page><page sequence="7">SUE MITCHELL CROWLEY 33 conceits of the Metaphysicals, the poems substitute a formula for a form, "a genuine habit of seeing," which would allow the emotion to emerge naturally from the poem and crown its meaning. Formula stops short of form; obsession stops short of emotion. "On the Eve of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, 1942" is typical of the poems of Land of Unlikeness. Even one stanza manifests Blackmur's "gritting." Mother of God, whose burly love Turns swords to plowshares, come, improve On the big wars And make this holiday with Mars Your Feast Day, while Bellona's bluff Courage or call it what you please Plays blindman's buff Through virtue's knees.4 Blackmur discovers in Lowell's work the same kind of disjunction he did in the bulk of Hardy's: the latter, he says, assaults "his material with an emotion, preferably violent, and an idea, preferably distraught, in either hand" {Language 62). The result in both cases is forced rhyme, wrenchings of sense and meter. There is strain rather than strength, tension that stops short of the release of emotion. Lowell's passion is real. His poem, a prayer to the Virgin Mary, indicts war as a recrucifixion of Christ in mankind, what Fein calls "a ghastly human eucharist" (821). Classical and contemporary figures merge as symbolic and the Virgin Mary is placed over against Bellona and Eisenhower as "belle," or "Celestial hoyden" who must be pursued by the soldiers and discovered as Mother, giver of the Christ-bread. The Immaculate Conception of the Virgin is the victory over the Satan of war, but still "man eats the Dead / from pole to pole." The poem is characteristic of Lowell's early work in that it embodies religious imagery and moral statement in ironic juxtaposition. It does not so much celebrate faith as it rejects a fallen world. And any sense of prayer that would arise from a true religious tension or ambiguity is lost in the obvious and awkward language and meter. Between the writing of this Marian poem and its publication in the 1944 collection, Lowell - who had tried to enlist at the beginning of the war - was indicted and served six months in a federal prison for failure to obey the Selective Service Act. (In his defense he cited the bombing of European civil- ians.5) No one would doubt the sincerity of Lowell's pacifism in his life or his early work; but the tone of "On the Eve . . ." remains vin- dictive and fails of the universality Blackmur believes derives from anonymity {Expense 55-56).</page><page sequence="8">34 Religion &amp; Literature "The Quaker Graveyard in Nantucket," which is generally regarded as the finest poem of Lord Wearys Castle, overcomes the previous prob- lems and results in just such a universality. The occasion of the poem, the drowning of his cousin, is clearly personal for Lowell. Blackmur cites approvingly Hardy's "Last Words to a Dumb Friend" as "one of those deeply honest, creative visions of man in relation to death which summoned the full imagination in Hardy as nothing else could" {Language 77). One wonders why Blackmur fails to recognize the grandeur of "Quaker Graveyard," which mourns all untimely death and particularly the dead of World War II, and which in its "loving meters" has the sign of Blackmur's "objectivity achieved," "the applica- tion to the idea of as much life as can be brought to bear" {Expense 65) and powerful enough to render reality actual. The Quaker sailors, the lost crew of Ahab's Pequod, Jonah and Jonas Messias, the Christ in whose side (as in "On the Eve . . .") the steel of war may be hidden and perhaps redeemed, merge to provide a series of objective cor- relatives. The paradox lies here, not in metaphysical conceits, but in the dual vision inherent in the poem: on the one hand, God gave man dominion over the earth and the sea, and on the other, not only do men condemn one another to death, but that very death is part of God's plan, and the sea, whose cadences we hear in the poem, is the death- bringer. In the haunting final line, "The Lord survives the rainbow of his will" {Selected Poems 10), the promise to Noah is achieved in a history as diverse in its horror and its glory as the prism of a rainbow. The tension of such a paradox is not resolved, but in its universality the reader participates in the release of emotion. This voice of Robert Lowell can only be called deeply contemplative. Such a paradoxical promise is necessarily that of an inscrutable God. The ultimate "reality," Blackmur's Numen, is inscrutable for Lowell and would remain so throughout the rest of his life. God's inscrutability is first actualized in this wartime poem. In "Quaker Graveyard" the tension of necessity is acknowledged, if not accepted, in ironic antith- eses: the sea which symbolizes the world is at once man's province and the source of his mortality, and both are aspects of the rainbow-will of God. The very Catholic stanza which Lowell inserts into the Puri- tan context of the poem points in that direction. In describing the old English shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham, Lowell seems to reject the anthropomorphic conception of heaven and offer instead an image of the Virgin ultimately understanding what God understands, what lies beyond her own human story, beyond human intelligibility: the absolute paradox of good and evil:</page><page sequence="9">SUE MITCHELL CROWLEY 35 This face, for centuries a memory, Non est species, neque decor Expressionless, expresses God: it goes Past castled Sion. She knows what God knows, Not Calvary's Cross nor crib at Bethlehem Now, and the world shall come to Walsinffham. (10) This passage may well be the closest Lowell ever came to the mystical vision of Eliot in the Quartets. Nevertheless, "Quaker Graveyard" does not depict a religious be- lief like Eliot's, but Lowell's own. In his 1943 review of Eliot, Lowell writes, "form is nothing but unity and integration," a definition iden- tical to Blackmur's. The unity of "Quaker Graveyard" arises out of Lowell's very elegiac sense of the impossibility of Eliot's religious vi- sion for himself. Lowell believes that "union with God is somewhere in sight in all poetry." But if he can assess the Four Quartets as a "quasi- autobiographical testimony of the experience of union with God, or rather its imperfect approximation in this life" in which "artistic craft is analogous to contemplative discipline," and "aesthetic experience to ecstasy," he was never, so far as we can tell, to achieve this for himself. Eliot moved from the "lost connections" of "Prufrock" and "The Waste Land" to escape to "the moment taken out of time," in what Lowell calls "the most powerful religious poem of the twentieth century, and certainly the most remarkable and ambitious expression of Catholic mysticism in English" {Prose 45-47). Lowell's poetry demonstrates an opposite movement, from the overtly religious to a later style in which religious imagery is almost nonexistent. If Eliot could transcend history and the self, Lowell would make his greatest poetry by universalizing the confessional self and the self in history. It is possible that from the first Lowell's experience of God was always in a sense more Calvinist than Catholic. A strong sense of predestination runs through the Lowell corpus, often in the guise of classical fate. He had difficulty seeing modern man, and most of all himself, as chosen. His later religious vision - and I believe one may call it that - will not be one of union with God but rather of the absence of God in the actions of men. And this direction was already implicit in the early war poems. In the end - insofar as the poems betray the man - the absence of God in man's history creates the deus absconditus for Lowell himself. So insofar as Lowell's verse is born out of the behavior of human beings the question is a moraZ-religious one. We must then ask Black- mur's question: "How do morals get into literature?" or how does be- havior get into a poem and what does it do when it gets there? I would</page><page sequence="10">36 Religion &amp; Literature like to match Blackmur's answer with Lowell's "Beyond the Alps," writ- ten at the peak of the poet's career.6 This poem is crucial because critics usually cite it in radically oversimplified treatments of Lowell's rejec- tion of Catholicism. But "Beyond the Alps" in fact involves a complex set of moral values that explain Lowell's position. The poem is pivotal in Lowell's craft as well as in his life. While the sonnet sequence of "Beyond the Alps" is highly formalized, Lowell is now a poet accomplished enough to free the formula to become true form; and while the voice is authentically autobiographical - he is there, as Eliot is in the Quartets - it transcends personality, to attain the anonymity that marks the universal. This poetic greatness, which found an earlier conception in "Quaker Graveyard," is now embodied in Lowell's "confessional" mode. The personally revelatory poems of Life Studies and For the Union Dead are also often public poems sound- ing the theme of protest that will characterize his later work. In the 1961 essay Blackmur characterized Lowell as one of those Jacob figures who wrestle with God, the conscience and our behavior: "Skunk Hour" is surely a wrestling with all three. But our immediate concern here is Lowell's sense of that sort of behavior which can only be called public morality, and which, in turn, results in private deci- sion. His abiding pacifism - he was later to march against the Viet Nam War and refuse an invitation to the White House during the Johnson administration - and his outrage at man's tyranny to man ac- count for the deeply anti-institutional "Beyond the Alps." Blackmur's conception of morality in literature may stand as a sort of thesis for the poem: In literature morals are compelled to respond to the turbulence of actual life. Indeed in that response is the source of social structures and of morals them- selves; for that response is the rational insistence of the individual on his right to survive no matter what obstacles. Literature is our account of such survivals and failures to survive. Literature is our theoretic struggle with behavior; but we feed on what we fight and move in the form of our struggle. For behavior gets into literature as the outward and sensible form of our momentum, the forces which carry us on, some our own and some alien to us: some breathing of our dearest selves, some the air that suffocates us. Behavior, in literature, criticizes and undermines both our aspirations and our institutional or dogmatic reality. . . . Our behavior has always known how to estimate . . . that the evil in our lives comes from our institutions, so soon as they harden. {Lion 305) In his multi-leveled treatment of history, Lowell achieves what Blackmur refers to in his essay on James's later novels when he depicts the novelist as seizing concretely the moral terms of "the permanent struggle between the human condition and human aspirations" (Lion</page><page sequence="11">SUE MITCHELL CROWLEY 37 274). Lowell creates an order, a very high order indeed, out of the chaos of history. Each smallest image and largest allusion in "Beyond the Alps" contributes to a unified whole, one past event referring to another and that to still another and that to the present, so that one may read Lowell's poem organically as Blackmur reads the Quartets, as an example of the way behavior gives the pressure toward Incarna- tion {Language 192). Language, the working of words among themselves, produces "builded" rather than ready-made emotion, an emotion that will in the end crown the poem. The title "Beyond the Alps" is the clue to the poem's theme of the hardening of institutions. "Ultramontanism" was the term used by the French, in the controversy over papal infallibility, to describe Rome's strict adherence to that doctrine. Beyond the mountains lies the seat of empire, Church or state, and Lowell reinforces this idea with his epigraph from Napoleon. The structure or story of the poem is Lowell's pullman journey over the Alps from Rome to Paris. But it is, in fact, a spiritual journey. During his Kenyon College years, Lowell had turned from the Puritanism of his famous New England family to Catholicism. Here he introduces in his title, albeit subtly, his motivation for leav- ing the institutional Church of Rome. Later he proclaims the actual occasion for the poem, "When the Vatican made Mary's Assumption dogma," in the second stanza. The emphasis is on "Vatican" and "dogma" as if something negative had been done to the idea itself. The opposition of the "Assumption" to "dogma" introduces Lowell's major metaphor. He juxtaposes images of rising with those of declining and falling: the very movement of the train over the mountains. His theme is the decline of Rome, politi- cally and spiritually, as an allegory for later history and the lost possi- bility of spiritual heights: Reading how even the Swiss had thrown the sponge in once again, and Everest was still unsealed, I watched our Paris pullman lunge, mooning across the fallow Alpine snow- ed bella Roma\ I saw our stewards go forward on tiptoe banging on their gongs. Man changed to landscape. Much against my will, I left the City of God where it belongs. There the skirt-mad Mussolini unfurled the eagle of Caesar. He was one of us only, pure prose. I envy the conspicuous waste of our grandparents on their grand tours - long-haired Victorian sages accepted the universe, while breezing on their trust funds through the world.</page><page sequence="12">38 Religion &amp; Literature In a tone almost conversational, the poet describes reading a news- paper account of the Swiss climbers on Everest who have once more "thrown in the sponge." As the train crosses the "fallow" Alpine snow by moonlight, the dining car stewards enter a landscape of memory and become Caesar's legions marching into battle sounding their gongs. Then come the often-quoted lines: "Much against my will, / I left the City of God where it belongs." Lowell seems to be saying not that Rome is the City of God, but at once regretfully and ironically that it is not, as he had hoped, the earthly form of Augustine's supernatural city. In giving his reason for leaving the Church he is imbedding it in the histories of ancient and modern dictators. "There the skirt-mad Musso- lini unfurled / the eagle of Caesar." "Skirt-mad" may apply to Musso- lini's mistress with whom he was hanged or to his active distaste for the clerical cassocks of Rome. He was "pure prose," not a god, one of us after all in death. The reference to the Victorian sages who ac- cepted the universe seems at first extraneous. It may, however, refer to Newman, or simply to the Victorian ease in spiritual "trust funds," an ease Lowell seems never to have enjoyed, least of all now in his rejection of the Church's authority. The second sonnet creates the scene in San Pietro for the definition of the dogma. Others present on that day confirm what Lowell must have felt. A million people crowded Rome for what was essentially a public relations event: When the Vatican made Mary's Assumption dogma, the crowds at San Pietro screamed Papal The Holy Father dropped his shaving glass, and listened. His electric razor purred, his pet canary chirped on his right hand. The lights of science couldn't hold a candle to Mary risen, gorgeous as a jungle bird! But who believed this? Who could understand? Pilgrims still kissed Saint Peter's brazen sandal. The Duce's lynched, bare, booted skull still spoke. God herded his people to the coup de grace- the costumed Switzers sloped their pikes to push. Oh Pius, through the monstrous human crush . . . Lowell notes ironically that the crowd "screamed Papal" for the celebra- tion of the ultimate Mother. The Pope inside the Vatican is radically diminished as he "drops his shaving glass" and listens. The wonders of modern science are sharply reduced by the intentional triteness of Lowell's phrasing as he distorts the image of the votive light: "The lights of science couldn't hold a candle. ..." Lowell is preparing us for the</page><page sequence="13">SUE MITCHELL CROWLEY 39 poem's "rising" and those lines which invite the greatest disparity of criticism.7 For Lowell the Virgin is still "belle" and Mother, but here she is light against the darkness of institutionalized dogma, and as jungle bird, unlike the captive canary, she is natural, free, almost paganized. The Life Studies version had two additional modifiers: Mary risen at one miraculous stroke, angel-winged, gorgeous as a jungle bird! Lowell has deleted these phrases in the interest of better poetry, but their presence in the earlier version argues for a definitively positive reading of the role of Mary in "Beyond the Alps."8 The Assumption of the Virgin is the one rising in the poem that is still possible, that stands over against the fall of man. The concept of the Virgin seems to have captured Lowell's imagination in a way that makes faith in the doctrine as dogma beside the point. Her light is warm in contrast to the upcoming snowy heights of Minerva, goddess of both war and reason, "the mis-carriage of the brain." Mary embodies "the mo- ment taken out of time" for Lowell. She is the objective correlative for the Numen, the aspirations of the human spirit that would transcend history. "But who believed this? Who could understand?" Is this the voice of Pius XII or of the poet? It is clearly Lowell's own question': he or- dinarily surrounds the spoken words of the figures in his poems with quotation marks. All the world may come to Walsingham, but the real meaning of the Assumption escapes the crowd who merely kiss Saint Peter's brazen sandal. The same crowd followed the Duce, both "psy- chopath and soldier" like so many Emperors before him. Mussolini drained Caesar's Palatine marshes for his people, and was lynched by them, and that "bare, booted skull," like the other images in Lowell's Italian history, still speaks to the present. As in "On the Eve ..." and "Quaker Graveyard," World War II and the Virgin operate as dialec- tical antitheses. The second sonnet ends with a still more terrifying image. The Swiss who failed, not only on the heights of Everest, but (as many think) to oppose the Nazis, now become the Swiss Guard herding the crowd in St. Peter's square. Lowell is evoking the human "crush," the Jews, the people of God, herded to the coup de grace of the camps. The words, "Oh Pius," take on a terrible irony as Lowell condemns the impiousness of the Pontiff- and by implication all men of religion - who failed to intervene in the fate of the Jews. The conversational tone of the man on the train has now become apocalyptic. And the question of the</page><page sequence="14">40 Religion &amp; Literature rainbow- will of an inscrutable God who allows such acts hangs inevitably and unavoidably in the air. "Beyond the Alps," then, embodies both Blackmur's Numen and his Moha. The numen or numinosus is that power within us, greater than and other than ourselves, that moves us, sometimes carrying us away, in the end moving us forward unless we drop out, always overwhelming us. So far as it may be felt in literature it resembles the force of the sublime described by Longinus - the blow that transports us. It is a force sometimes cultivated as magic, as supersti- tion, as mystery: it is related to the rhythm which gives meaning to action. Religion has always cultivated this force with the piety of excruciated sense, and religion has always taken it as the spring of the absolute, or rational action, action - not the action but its spring, as the Incarnation or Crucifixion. Thus the Numen enters, though it is not itself, behavior. It is the reality that presses into behavior but never reaches whole incarnation there. For unfortunately, when the Numen gets into behavior it gets transformed ... or degraded, into that privation of humanity for which the best name I know is Moha: the uncontrollable behavior which tends to absorb and defile both the chill and the fire of spirit. (Lion 293) Blackmur goes on to explain that Moha is the term for "the contemp- tuous stupidity of man confronted with choice or purpose." He learned the word from a physicist at Los Alamos, and concludes that "the atomic bomb was a labor of the Moha" Over against bestial human institutions which kill the spirit, Black- mur places a conception of reason, one which allows for the miracle of the poem: Reason's requirements are never met. But it is this beautiful reason which stands between the Numen and the Moha - either as art or as the reflective faculty - acknowledging, ministering to, and representing both, in the names of memory and hope. Reason is in this sense the whole mind, the residual form of all we have been, and the conceiving matrix of all we may become. Reason is a ser- vant, the housekeeper who keeps things going by criticism, by philosophy, by art. (294) Reason is embodied in moral philosophy. Literature is still another in- carnation of our experience of life. Art, like philosophy, is a new form of order for the conflict of the Numen and the Moha. A subject matter which involves murder and lust, as "Beyond the Alps" does, may well be a plea for a new order of things which may be impossible but is certainly vital. This conception of the poem as true reason that is both morality and art may help us understand why Lowell reinserted the third stanza in the version of "Beyond the Alps" collected in For the Union Dead. The</page><page sequence="15">SUE MITCHELL CROWLEY 41 sonnet sequence was a vehicle fully formed for the addition of a stanza which indicts by implication those who stand by as a nation's writers are persecuted for their politics: I thought of Ovid. For in Caesar's eyes that tomcat had the Number of the Beast, and now where Turkey faces the red east, and the twice-stormed Crimean spit, he cries: "Rome asked for poets. At her beck and call, came Lucan, Tacitus and Juvenal, the black republicans who tore the tits and bowels of the Mother Wolf to bits - Then psychopath and soldier waved the rod of empire over Caesar's salvaged bog . . . Imperial Tiber, Oh my yellow dog, black earth by the black Roman sea, I lie with the boy-crazy daughter of the God, il Duce Augusto. I shall never die." Ovid, called the greatest poet of his day, was exiled to the Black Sea by Augustus for reasons still debated by historians. The ostensible reason was the immorality of his Ars Amatoria, but a more likely one was Ovid's involvement in dynastic matters. Now Ovid lies buried by the Black Sea, as does Julia, "the boy-crazy daughter of the God," Augustus, ex- iled for her many affairs. From the grave Ovid cries down through the centuries to warn another nation of the fate of poets persecuted by their governments. He says, "Rome asked for poets" but received instead the republican moralists - Lucan, Tacitus and Juvenal. Lowell's italicizing of black republicans cannot be explained from classical history, nor has his punctuation been satisfactorily accounted for by critics of the poem. The Latin word atrox, derived from ater, "black," carries the connotations of fierce, wild, horrible. The reader might only wonder if perhaps Lowell had in mind the twentieth-century Republicans of the McCarthy hearings who, in their persecution of artists, tore the "tits and bowels" of a mother country to bits.9 When art and morality conflict, reason, in Blackmur's sense of the word, is lost; the Moha reigns. It was Ovid who called Augustus immortal in his Metamorphoses, but down to the last Duce the Roman dictators have remained mortal, so the final line of the stanza must then refer to the statement of Horace, Ovid's friend, that it is poetry, longer lasting than bronze, that will live "forever." The poem itself, the embodiment of reason, the order- ing of behavior, is the ultimate rising which survives its own historical moment. What Blackmur says about James, concerning the form in which</page><page sequence="16">42 Religion &amp; Literature the conditions of life are apprehended, applies as well to Lowell: "The strongest shape and the sharpest motion - the deepest heaving qualm" the artist is able "to create out of that havoc is the shaping in heaving motion of a conscience out of consciousness" {Lion 279). It is this con- science, this passion discovering its true rhythm, which is the authen- tic voice of Robert Lowell. He concludes: Our mountain-climbing train had come to earth. Tired of the querulous hush-hush of the wheels, the blear-eyed ego kicking in my berth lay still, and saw Apollo plant his heels on terra firma through the morning's thigh - each backward wasted Alp, a Parthenon, fire-branded socket of the cyclops' eye . . . There are no tickets to that altitude, once held by Hellas when the Goddess stood, prince, pope, philosopher and golden bough, pure mind and murder at the scything prow - Minerva the mis-carriage of the brain . . . Now Paris, our black classic, breaking up like killer kings on an Etruscan cup. There is pathos here, in the sense that the seeming Numen, those im- possible white altitudes for which there are no longer tickets, really represents pure mind or reason at one with violence. And the black republicans, the black earth by the black sea, "the black classic" of history, which is breaking up as he enters the black city of Paris - all these aspects of the Moha are "like killer kings on an Etruscan cup." They do not allow for mystery or miracle. Only Mary is from first to last numinous in Lowell's verse. One may wonder, then, if it was not Lowell's sense of the history of man, modern Calvinists and Catholics as well as ancient Romans, that caused his "loss of faith." For Lowell makes history an allegory on itself. The analogies in "Beyond the Alps," like those in the Quartets, by enlightening each other, enlighten themselves (Language 216). But Lowell's analogies between the different figures in history, operating by association, are undeclared and ungoverned. They always require the reader to complete their parallels; they represent more than they state. In "A Burden for Critics" Blackmur defines the way in which a current culture and a tradition inform a work of art: The arts cannot help reacting directly and conventionally to what is actual in their own time; nor can the arts help, whether consciously or not, working into their masterpieces what has survived of the full tradition - however they may contort or corrupt it. They deal with life or experience itself, both what is new</page><page sequence="17">SUE MITCHELL CROWLEY 43 and what is accumulated, inherited, still living. They cannot come de novo. They cannot help, therefore, creating at a disinterested level, despite them- selves. That is why they constitute a resource of what is not new - the greater part of ourselves - and a means of focusing what is new, all that necessarily aggravates us and tears at our nerve ends in our friction with it. (Lion 205) Blackmur then ought to have understood Lowell's method of reorder- ing that which "tears at our nerve ends" in the present by juxtaposing it with the past. Lowell seems to have been destined to confront endlessly the human behavior of the three decades in which he wrote. In "Beyond the Alps" it is the "blear-eyed sleepless ego," the morally watchful true self of Lowell, who ponders all night long the lost heights of mankind. He was to continue to be a voice for his time, a fact perhaps best memorial- ized by the poems and the supplemental calendar of the marches, riots and assassinations of 1968 that he appends to his Notebook. It is far more difficult to assess what became of the overtly religious impulse of Robert Lowell. In many ways the displacement of orthodoxy by protest was characteristic of the intellectuals of the fifties and six- ties. And yet there seems to be more to it than that for Lowell. A sense of his own lost heights never disappears entirely from the later volumes. In "Home" (1976) Lowell gives what seems a footnote to his earlier Marian poems, as well as to his marriages: The Queen of Heaven, I miss her we were divorced. She never doubted the divided, stricken soul could call her Maria, and rob the devil with a word. (Day 115) In "Domesday Book" he writes elegiacally that "the reign of the king- fisher was short" {Day 56). He seems to identify with his classical hero Propertius whom he sees most like "a fallen Christian" {Prose 254). In considering his own "Skunk Hour" he writes that it is both "puritan and agnostic" {Prose 226). He seems to use "agnostic" in Aldous Hux- ley's sense of the word, for one who believes in "an unknown and un- knowable God" {OED I, 86). Lowell explains that in the poem he is asking the reader to remember St. John of the Cross's dark night of the soul. But his night is not "gracious"; it is rather an "existential night" {Prose 226). Blackmur, writing on modern poets, says that the dark night never ends "since it was a darkness we ourselves made" ("Religious Poetry" 285). Perhaps Lowell would agree. In "No Messiah," again paralleling his marital divorce and his divorce from the Church, he writes:</page><page sequence="18">44 Religion &amp; Literature Sometime I must try to write the truth, but almost everything has fallen awry lost in passage when we said goodbye in Rome. Even the license of my mind rebels, and can find no lodging for my two lives. Some things like death are never meant to have an outcome. I come like someone naked in my raincoat, But only a girl is naked in a raincoat. Planesick on New York food, I feel the old subway reverberate through our apartment floor, I stop in our Christmas-papered bedroom, hearing my A/0/0, the non-Messianic man - drop, drop in silence, then a louder drop echoed elsewhere by a louder drop. (Selected Poems 246) Certainly Robert Lowell made very clear his separation from orthodox religion; yet he was buried in 1977 from the Episcopal Church at his own request.10 Who is to say what was between Robert Lowell and that inscrutable God of his? Perhaps he discovered, as certain theolo- gians have, that we know God best in His absence. What is clear to us is that despite the many deeply hurtful acts of his manic-depressive phases, we may still witness the deeply serious moral commitment of the poet in this "land of unlikeness." If Blackmur faulted his early verse, he should have recognized how completely the "Christian distinction of Good and Evil" permeates Lowell's poetry from beginning to end. Though in his last volumes Lowell's poetic powers are noticeably declining, often to the merely confessional, he does seem more at home in the world. Perhaps with the help of lithium he could now relate more easily to the people and places of his time, his current history. The great poems of the middle phase - Life Studies and For the Union Dead- remain, however, the climax of his career. He placed "The Dolphin" at the end of his 1977 collection, as a kind of apologia on the relationship of his life to his craft. So much statement it is hardly poem, it ends: I have sat and listened to too many words of the collaborating muse and plotted perhaps too freely with my life, not avoiding injury to others, not avoiding injury to myself- to ask compassion . . . this book, half fiction, an eelnet made by man for the eel fighting - my eyes have seen what my hand did. (Selected Poems 246) If Lowell here seems to accept things as they are, he is still a victim of his own Calvinist guilt, and eternally Blackmur's peregrine, an</page><page sequence="19">SUE MITCHELL CROWLEY 45 "alien, a wanderer."11 What he explained to Seidel in 1961 remains true: My last poems don't use religious imagery, they don't use symbolism. In many ways they seem to me more religious than the early ones. . . . I'm sure the sym- bols and the Catholic framework didn't make the poems religious experiences. Yet I don't feel my experience changed very much . . . the same sort of strug- gle, light and darkness, the flux of experience. The morality seems much the same. But the symbolism is gone. You couldn't possibly say what creed I believed in. I've wondered myself often. Yet what made the earlier poems valuable seems to be some recording of experience, and that seems to be what makes the later ones. (Prose 250) The darkness was great for Lowell: Blackmur does not seem to have recognized that. Perhaps because Lowell's reason was so fragile, he struggled, Jacob-like, harder for the reason that is the poem. Perhaps, failing Eliot's vision of faith, he embodied Eliot's sense of man, so often quoted by Blackmur: "Human kind cannot bear very much reality." The University of Missouri- Columbia NOTES 1. The relationship of Lowell to R. P. Blackmur is documented in a number of sources. Lowell, in his interview with Frederick Seidel in 1961, recalls: "When I was twenty and learning to write, Allen Tate, Eliot, Blackmur, and Winters, and all those people were very much news. You waited for their essays, and when a good critical essay came out it had the excitement of a new imaginative work" {Prose 237). In re- sponse to a question from Ian Hamilton about the role of Blackmur in his life, Lowell had this to say in 1971: I knew him quite well but only painfully and later. He was more of New England than anyone, and had a genius. In his prose, every sentence struggles to be poetry, form ringing on rock. He was a good poet, weird, tortured, derivative, original - and more a poet in his criticism. A side of him wanted to write novels, because he remembered everything and felt things most critics can't - people. He was more industrious than other critics with style, wrote heavily and yet with a grace; had anarchy and discipline - perhaps he overcherished both . . . the type of the sincere. {Prose 278) Blackmur's review of Land oj Unlikeness appeared first in the Kenyon Review 7 (1945) 339-52 as "Notes on Eleven Poets." Hamilton notes that "(Ransom later wrote to Lowell to apologize for Blackmur's 'patronizing and superior remarks.') Unlike any of the other reviewers, Blackmur meets the book's essential character head on, and his stric- tures may well have been the ones that Lowell brooded on most fruitfully" (99). Hamilton describes the effects of the deaths, all in the same year, of Eliot, Frost, Roethke and Blackmur on the younger poet. Of the last he writes:</page><page sequence="20">46 Religion &amp; Literature In the hospital at Hartford in February 1965 Lowell learned of the death of the critic R. P. Blackmur. Lowell had not been an intimate of Blackmur's, although they had over the years visited each other's country homes in Maine, and Lowell had always been grateful for the acute review Blackmur had writ- ten of Land of Unlikeness . He was, in Lowell's view, "an awesome critic" [R. L. to Elizabeth Hardwick, February 5, 1965] and also "a good poet, weird, tor- tured, derivative, original - and more a poet in his criticism" [R. L., interview, Review, no. 26 (Summer 1971)]. The news of his death, though, was for Lowell not just a personal blow; it was yet another sign of the unsteadiness of his whole world of literary friends and mentors. Blackmur had died at sixty-one, but Lowell said, "he always seemed to me like a young man, just a little my senior" [R. L. to Elizabeth Hardwick, February 5, 1965]. (334) An account of the intricate relationships of the poets of Lowell's generation and their mentor, Blackmur, may be found in the memoir of Eileen Simpson (formerly Mrs. John Berry man), Poets in their Youth. 2. Lowell believes "Eliot has done what he said Shakespeare had done: all his poems are one poem, a form of continuity that has grown and snowballed with him." Lowell continually revised and collected and re-collected his poems, and in the "Note" in Selected Poems he speaks of the volumes as his verse autobiography (vii). 3. Blackmur cites "To Delmore Schwartz," " 'To Speak of Woe That Is in Mar- riage,' " and "Memories of West Street and Lepke." 4. Land of Unlikeness is unpaginated. 5. Lowell describes his experience in jail during World War II in "Memories of West Street and Lepke": I was a fire-breathing Catholic CO. and made my manic statement, telling off the state and president, and then sat waiting sentence in the bull pen beside a Negro boy with curlicues of marijuana in his hair. See Collected Prose ■, 367-371 for his letters of protest against these wars to Presidents Roosevelt and Johnson. 6. In the Noonday paperback edition (1964), "Beyond the Alps" appears as the opening poem of Life Studies with three stanzas and the closing couplet (3-4). In For the Union Dead in the same volume, Lowell has chosen to collect it with four stanzas and the couplet (55-57). In Selected Poems "Alps" once again has three stanzas and the couplet. The four-stanza version is the basis of my study. 7 . For complimentary and contrary readings of "Beyond the Alps" see the work of these critics: Vereen M. Bell, Glauco Cambon, Patrick Cosgrave, Irvin Ehren- preis, Jerome Mazzaro, Burton Raffel, Mark Rudman, Hugh B. Staples and Stephen Yenser. 8. Lowell's first poem, in prep school, was on the Virgin Mary. See also his treat- ment of the Virgin Mary in "A Prayer for my Grandfather to Our Lady" {Land) and "For George Santayana" {Life). 9. Lowell dedicated "Brunetto Latini" {Near the Ocean 109-1 16) to Lillian Hellman who, like Dashiell Hammett, with whom she spent much of her life, was called before the McCarthy committee. In Lowell's translation, as in Canto XV of the Inferno, Latini warns Dante of his future political exile.</page><page sequence="21">SUE MITCHELL CROWLEY 47 10. New York Times, September 9, 1977. See Hamilton's biography (473-74) for an account of Lowell's death, burial and memorial service. 1 1 . Blackmur is employing Eliot's Augustinian image from the Quartets to describe Eliot himself. He is at pains to define "peregrine": In the Republic and the Empire, Peregrini were, in Rome, citizens of any state other than Rome, with an implied membership in a definite community. So says the Oxford Classical Dictionary. The Shorter Oxford Dictionary says of "Peregrine": one from foreign parts, an alien, a wanderer; and goes on to say that in astrology (that ironic refuge of Eliot as of Donne and of Dante) a peregrine is a planet situated in a part of the zodiac where it has none of its essential dignity. In Italian the meanings are similar, and the notion of pilgrim is a late develop- ment.- Have we not an expatriate looking for a patria - an American turned Anglican - a perpetual peregrine at Rome? . . . I do not think this is too much to pack into a word, but it is no wonder that it should take the attribute unap- peasable, for it is the demands of the peregrine, whether outsider or pilgrim, that cannot be met. I will add that the peregrine is also a hawk or falcon found the world over but never at home: always a migrant but everywhere met; and, wherever found, courageous and swift. {Language 219-20) WORKS CITED Blackmur, R.
