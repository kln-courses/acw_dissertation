<plain_text><page sequence="1">LETTERS To the Editor: Richard A. Moore's article, "Academic Dessin Theory after the Reorganization of 1863" (JSAH, October 1977), and other con- tributions to current discussions of values in architectural education prompt an old gradu- ate of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris to offer three comments: I. THEORY. Richard Moore's extensive re- search of documents relating to instruction in the visual arts in France elaborates a the- ory of composition-dessin is the word- based on classical models which generally re- sulted in symmetrical arrangements. Certain types of problems, particularly those spon- sored by the Academy, were clearly influ- enced thereby. Typical were the plans chosen to illustrate the article (although the classi- cal analytiques were freely composed). But as students at the Ecole we were rarely preoccu- pied with background writings or theory. We concentrated on practical problems as- signed for our competitive exercises and de- veloped forms expressive of our concepts, symmetrical or unsymmetrical as require- ments dictated. We never heard of a dessin theory as a principle of composition. During four years at the Ecole, the word dessin with that meaning was never spoken. Dessin to us meant simple drawing, not design. 2. HISTORY. Richard Chafee's essay, "The Teaching of Architecture at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts," is an important contribution to the comprehensive volume on Beaux-Arts architecture published by the Museum of Modern Art in New York in I977. Avoiding discussion of theory Chafee outlines the his- tory of instruction in architecture, first by the Academy, then by the Ecole, and finally by the successor Units which replaced the school in 1968. He reviews changes in au- thority, development of the Ecole, and suc- cessive stages in scope and emphasis of the curriculum. Engaging glimpses of the lives and thoughts of students and mentors re- flect the character of the Ecole in the years of its greatest effectiveness and dominant influ- ence on the architecture of the time. 3. METHOD. For a more complete under- standing of the educational process within zz8 the Ecole, theory and history must be supple- mented by analysis of methods of work which preoccupied the students. Donald A. Fletcher, disciplined in the school, diplome in 1927, has provided a clue. His Introduc- tion to Architectural Design analyzes factors in design by means of a series of elementary exercises involving basic principles, suggests ways of organizing ideas selectively, and out- lines a method of work. He concludes with numerous helpful hints and stimulating ob- servations on related problems.

MOORE, F.A.I.A. New York City To the Editor: I am pleased that the photographs in my recent book excite the study and speculation of the reviewer, but in the interest of accuracy I would like to register disagreement with some of those speculations (Slobodan Curcic, review of The Byzantine Churches of Istan- bul. A Photographic Survey, JSAH, Decem- ber 1977). Hag. Andreas en teKrisei. In the absence of excavations it is premature to assume that the exterior "preserves nothing of its original character." In spite of Turkish alterations the great square base of the cupola and the east barrel vault are certainly original, and the roof levels of the surrounding aisles and nartheces cannot have been much altered. Aykapi Church. The "cloissone" masonry technique in this little ruin uses only occa- sional vertical bricks between the blocks of stone in a pattern very similar to that of the faSade of the Gil Camii (photograph 13-7), or that of the substructures, as reported by H. Schafer (cited in the text and bibliog- raphy). Beyazit Churches. The differences be- tween the present plan and earlier published plans of this excavation are due to my use here of E. Mamboury's survey of the site, a better source which had not been available to me previously. This source is acknowledged in the Introduction, xviii, n. 5. Christos tes Choras. I see no evidence that a bell tower stood at the northwest corner. The now vanished ruins at this point, which appear in Paspates' lithograph (photograph 8-z) were the remains of an inclined Turkish buttress, according to D. Pulgher's drawings (Les Anciennes Eglises Byzantines de Con- stantinople, Vienna, 1878, pls. xvI, xvII and xxvIII). The north faqade with its decorated spandrels appears in photograph 8-5. Hag. loannes Prodromos en to Hebdomo. Although the Hebdomon is outside the walls I don't believe it is "arbitrary" to include it with the city, even though the rest of Thrace is not included. We make a similar distinc- tion when we include St. Peter's or St. Paul's in discussions of Rome while excluding Tivo- li. The suburban Hebdomon played an im- portant role in the life and ceremonial of court and city. (Cf. T. Mathews, "Architec- ture et liturgie dans les premieres eglises palatiales de Constantinople," Revue de I'Art, xxiv, I974, 22-29.) Hag. loannes Prodromos en to Troullo. Arcosolia were a popular Byzantine burial form in all periods and cannot serve to date this puzzling church. They were used for im- perial burials at the Pantokrator in middle Byzantine times (photograph io-5o), and in hypogea in early Byzantine times (cf. N. Firatli, "Notes sur quelques hypogees pal- eochretiens de Constantinople," Romische Quartalschrift-Suppl., xxx, I966, 138, fig. 9). Manastir Mescidi. The small windows in the upper part of the side walls of this church are at a level below the vaults of the porches that flanked the church. The vaults sprang from the string course. Windows at this level say nothing about the shape of the super- structure (cf. A. Pasadaios as cited in the bibliography). THOMAS F. MATHEWS New York University</page><page sequence="2">229 To the Editor: I concur fully with Professor Mathews's insistence on accuracy, and consequently offer the following clarifications: i. There is no question that arcosolia were common in Early Christian and Early Byzan- tine times. One cannot insist, however, that this was true for the Middle Byzantine peri- od. The securely documented examples are few. In the case of the Pantokrator Monas- tery, mentioned by Professor Mathews (pho- tograph Io-50), we are hardly confronted with an "arcosolium" in the conventional sense because of its unusually attenuated pro- portions. Another arcosolium at the Panto- krator complex (in the narthex of the north church; cf. photographs Io-I, 10-32, and plan on p. 74) not mentioned by Professor Mathews, is clearly a later insertion. In any case, the fact remains that arcosolia did be- come popular again during the Palaeologan era. z. Regarding the hypothetical reconstruc- tion of the Manastir Mescidi, Professor Mathews insists with Pasadaios that the lat- eral "porches" were originally vaulted. Al- though this is a theoretical possibility, I see no evidence for it in the published photo- graphs. If such vaults did exist originally, is one to assume that all of the walls above the preserved string course were neatly rebuilt obliterating all physical remains of vault springers ? Furthermore, I do not understand the meaning of the assertion that "windows at this level say nothing about the super- structure." If we are to assume that these windows are original, they have a great deal to say about the presumed vaulting over the lateral "porches". Professor Mathews is correct in objecting to my suggestion that a belltower may have stood at the northwest corner of the Chora. This is my mistake. I intended to object to the lack of photographs of the southwest corner of the Chora complex, where the bell- tower is believed to have stood. SLOBODAN CURCIC University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign To the Editor: Although I am grateful for Professor Sarah Bradford Landau's essentially complimen- tary review of my short-title chronological list included in the most recent reprint of Henry Russell Hitchcock's American Archi- tectural Books..., she expresses puzzlement by notations "mysteriously" occurring in it to holdings in the Yale University Library (JSAH, March I978). Others may be simi- larly puzzled as to why only Yale is men- tioned, whereas Professor Hitchcock lists holdings at a number of depositories. And why a slight extension of his list for this one institution ? By way of explanation: Through an unin- tended and unfortunate oversight, the pub- lisher reproduced an old list directed to stu- dents for a class taught many years ago at Yale. This republication occurred without my permission or knowledge until I received a copy of the completed book. Although I am delighted that my chronology is honored by appearing where it can at last be of greatest use, prior consultation with me would have eliminated the mysterious notations. By now, of course, Yale will have substantially in- creased its holdings well beyond a count made two decades ago. WILLIAM H. JORDY Brown University To the Editor: I would like to reply to the review of my book, Pythagorean Palaces: Magic and Ar- chitecture in the Italian Renaissance (JSAH, May 1978). I will begin by describing what the book attempts to do rather than by re- butting Onians point for point, since the problem is not that I have tolerated incon- sistencies and misinterpreted texts, as he maintains, but that he misstates the purpose of the book and the nature of its subject. He assumes that I am attempting to explain a corpus of buildings by showing that these buildings resulted from the application of a particular architectural theory. Having made this assumption Onians is disappointed to find that I did not discuss many specific buildings, and that the theory fitted the few I did discuss imperfectly. That is he, like others who have reviewed the book, assumes that the validity of an architectural theory de- pends on its being proven to have been prac- ticed. This is to put my claims for Pythagorean- ism wrong way round. Pythagoreanism, the most important number doctrine of the Re- naissance, was less a theory than an attitude and a way of looking at and meditating about such things as architecture. Thus when I said that Italian Renaissance domestic architec- ture was largely ruled by Pythagorean princi- ples, I meant by "domestic architecture" the whole concept, allegorical, metaphorical, and metonymic, of the palace in Renaissance number theory. When I pointed to practical instances, to certain actual buildings, de- signs, or descriptions by Francesco di Giorgio and others that seemed to respond to the principles of Pythagoreanism, however par- tially, I noted these cases. But the real point is that, given the Pythagorean principle that Number and geometrical form were neces- sarily perfect and that matter was necessarily imperfect, such partial correspondences are all that are possible. Matter, certainly when it takes the form of buildings and even when it takes the form of drawings, is inimical to Number and hence to form as understood by the Pythagoreans. This is reflected again and again in the literature I cite. In short, the atti- tude I am talking about is a direct reversal of the one espoused by architectural historians nowadays. For the Pythagorean of the Re- naissance the theory is the main thing. It must be truly and fully set forth. The theory is the roast; the buildings are the parsley. Look at Alberti, Barbaro, Scamozzi even: what proportion of their texts is theoretical and what practical ? Even Serlio's treatise, in the standard edition, has five books pri- marily devoted to theory as opposed to two devoted to practical designs. The "real" buildings in the Pythagorean (and Neoplatonic) world I investigated, therefore, rise in the mind, not on the street. They may be suggested by actual buildings, as happened with Ficino. But the educated observer, in his thoughts, quickly moves from imperfect reality with its exceptions, com- promises, and mistakes, to speculate and muse on how it all should have been and of how it is in the unseen world of mental buildings. These ideas as I show are traceable in Al- berti; they dominate in Filarete and Colonna. They are elaborated by Francesco di Giorgio and further elaborated by the i6th-century Vitruvius scholiasts. When will we be able to see this historical balance between theory and practice reflected in our studies of Re- naissance architecture? But even with built buildings the literature of Pythagoreanism has something to teach us. An example is a passage from Ficino's Theologia Platonica (Book XII, Chapter 5; Opera, p. 275) not commented upon in my book: But surely it is to be asked why, if two windows be located, not one above the other but one next to the other, it offends us if one of them is larger and the other smaller, when they could be equal. If however one is above the other the inequality does not offend us even if one is half as big as the other. And why don't we much care how big the larger or the smaller is if there are two? But if three, sense itself seems to want either that they be equal or that between the largest and the smallest the middle one be such that it exceeds the smaller by as much as it is exceeded by the larger. Assuming that Ficino is speaking of window heights, he wants either uniformity, or else an arithmetical series, to govern in the verti- cal bays:</page><page sequence="3">z30 6 6 e - [~] equality arithmetical L or -- ratio - aliquot 6 6 / ratio 6 1l And he wants uniformity to govern in hori- zontal stories: This: [] [: Not this: [ Ficino adds that the arrangement ich pleases us most causes us to demand of it a higher sort of inner relationship-e.g., the mathematical ratio. He says that harmony or fitness (convenientia) "itself seeks equality and unity, either in the similarity of equal parts or in the gradation of unequal ones." In other words the arithmetical ratio in the window sizes provides a similarity or equality among the three windows because each shift in size is the same quantity. This holds for a three-story facade but not for a two-story one, since three is the minimum number of entities in such a ratio. He adds: "this true equality, similarity, and unity is apprehended not by the senses but by mental calculation" (mente intellecta). One does not simply see, but must measure and count. The horizontal rows of windows are similar; the vertical rows, if the facade is three stories high, are equal in that they vary equally; and since that equality is a constant, in this they have unity: they can be reduced to one. It is a truly Pytha- gorean conception. At this point I ask a question. Architec- tural historians, following Wittkower, have spent much time trying to discern mathe- matical series in room volumes and the like. Have they ever looked at facades in the way outlined above? When will distribution, hierarchy, dimension, and reduction become as important as proportion hunting in our interpretation of architecture ? These are the questions my book raises, and to which re- viewers should address themselves. All this passes Onians by. But if he is unin- structed as to the nature of Pythagoreanism he is doubly so as to its extent. Where the concepts just mentioned were commonplaces in Renaissance literature, and where tesserae (geometrical formations of dots), number- forms, and anthropomorphic dimensioning were equally well known, Onians claims that "almost the only Pythagorean element in any architectural text referred to" by me is Vitruvius's account of cubicae rationes. One hardly knows where to begin refuting this statement. It ignores, for one thing, the whole man-in-square-and-circle discussion in Vi- truvius III.i that is of the very essence of Pythagoreanism. This discussion becomes in turn a major theme in Vitruvius's immense Renaissance afterlife. One can go further: the differences between the temples Vitruvius knew and those demanded by his formulas are traceable to his desire to reduce them to a Pythagorean system. That the formulas lack, because of their wider central axis, "the abso- lute regularity necessary to Pythagorean- ism," as Onians says, is doubly false: i) they do not lack absolute regularity since a marked axis does not deprive a figure of that quality; z) absolute regularity (and here of course Onians means uniformity) is in any case not necessary to Pythagoreanism. There is no law against subgroups of tesserae. I re- spectfully suggest that if Onians were ac- quainted either with the classic literature of the subject, or with the modern writings of Heninger, Michel, Hopper, and others, he would have omitted almost all of what he says in his review (including the supposed contradictions and inconsistencies that he attributes to me but which, when they ac- tually exist, are to be found in the authors I cite). It would have become clear to him that there is no more need to prove the existence of Pythagoreanism in Renaissance architec- tural thought than to prove the positivism of Sigfried Giedion or the Christianity of St. Paul. Onians bases all this on my supposed in- ability to interpret texts. He tells his read- ers that I "manhandle," "creatively para- phrase," and "inflate" these texts; that (in a Ficinian flight of his own) "ideas are made to copulate with ideas until yet another pseudo- Pythagorean monster is born." However de- spite these incessant thunderings, Onians condescends to quote only one instance of such a misinterpretation. He chooses badly. He objects to my interpretation of the pas- sage (1.1.3) where Vitruvius talks about quod significat and quod significatur in architec- ture. In interpreting this passage Onians agrees with me; but he does not know he agrees with me because he does not under- stand what happens when quod significat is called a "signifier" and quod significatur a "signified." In modem usage this means that the process of signification is reciprocal. What is the signified, as opposed to what is the signifier, depends on whether you are building a temple or looking at one. If you are building a temple the formula signifies. The building is signified by the formula. If you are looking at the temple, the temple signifies and the formula is signified. In other words, it is the difference between saying, "Look at that Doric hexastyle temple" and saying "I am going to build a Doric hexa- style temple." Again, though I use the terms signified and signifier in the post-Saussurean sense, their particular application here is idiomatically Pythagorean. The onlooker reverses, by his scrutiny in accordance with number princi- ples, the process that the builder went through in designing the temple. As Ficino would say, the temple's equality, similarity, and unity cannot simply be seen but must be calculated first by the builder and then by the observer who comes along later and judges his work.
