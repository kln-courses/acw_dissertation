<plain_text><page sequence="1">XI*-INANIMATE AGENCY' by David Hirschmann We often speak of objects causing or making things happen. A ball may be said to have broken a window, a bird makes a nest, the sun causes the crops to ripen. Do such statements involve a notion of causality which is different from and not reducible to the notion of causality as a relation between events? Where the objects said to be causes are inanimate, the most common answer is "No". To many it seems so obvious that no argument is required. Thus Davidson writes, "We do indeed allow that inanimate objects cause or bring about various things .... However, this is ... only the ellipsis of event-causality"..2 Davidson does not say what he takes an inanimate object to be. Probably he intends his remark to apply only to non- living things. But the terms, "animate" and "inanimate" may also be used to distinguish between things which have a soul and things which do not. Taking the distinction this way, animals as well as stones are inanimate, if all the changes of an animal, like those of the stone, can be explained without reference to its soul. Now if to explain something without reference to a soul is to explain something without reference to any mental phenomena, then animals are inanimate only if their states and behaviour can be explained without claiming that they have mental characteristics as well as physical ones. But we need not assume this much in order to consider animals as inanimate objects (in the sense that they have no soul). D. G. Brown has argued,3 I believe correctly, that persons as agents have a point of view which is irreducibly different from the spectator's point of view; that, among other things, the question, "What shall I do ?" differs in an important respect from the question, "What shall he do?". Inanimate agents, in the sense of non-living ones, do not have a point *Meeting of the Aristotelian Society at 5/7 Tavistock Place, London, W.C.I, on Monday, 20th March 1972, at 7.30 p.m. I am grateful to Prof. Peter Alexander for his criticisms of an earlier version of this paper. 2 Donald Davidson, "Agency" in Agent, Action and Reason ed. by R.

It is not unreasonable (though maybe incorrect) to assume that animals do not have a point of view different from the spectator's, that the question "What shall I do?" does not arise and that any statement about an animal deliberating can be replaced by some purely causal statements. Now Brown expressly leaves animals and artefacts out of his account of agency. He warns that "our conception of ani- mals (and also artefacts) undergoes simultaneous temptations to anthropomorphism and to mechanism".4 I here succumb to the temptation to mechanism in order to show that the actions of non-human agents all have basically the same structure. I shall say that an object is an agent when it is said to cause something, or make it happen, or produce an effect, or act upon some thing. In this paper I shall argue that the relation of the notion of non-human agency to event-causality is much more complicated than the ellipsis view suggests. My aim is to develop an account of non-human agency which, while taking note of these complications, does not require us to abandon the claim that in some way statements about non- human objects causing things to happen imply statements about a causal relation between events. But what I shall offer will be an explanation of what is meant by non-human agency as opposed to a reduction or analysis. I should add that I am not concerned with whether "one thing makes another happen" is epistemologically prior to "one event causes another" though my thesis is that, in some sense, event- causality is logically prior to agency-causality with respect to non-human objects. Further what I have to say only has bearing on questions about human agency and action in so far as it has bearing on a general theory of action and agency. My terminology may be explained by example. A window pane suddenly breaks and a large hailstone appears on the floor. If the answer to the question "What broke the window?" is "the hailstone" then the hailstone is the agent which produced the effect of the window pane's breaking and the agent's action was the breaking of the window pane. I call a statement that the hailstone broke the window pane an agency-statement and a statement that the moving of the hailstone caused the 4ibid. p. io6.</page><page sequence="3">INANIMATE AGENCY 197 breaking of the window pane, a causal statement. I assume throughout this paper that we have a satisfactory account of "ca causes b", where a and b are events and I make no distinc- tion between events and states as causes. i. Conditions for an adequate explanation of agency There are many conditions that must be fulfilled for an account of agency to be considered adequate. I shall concen- trate on three which are relevant to my purposes. (a) We sometimes assert agency-statements when we have no idea as to what events caused the effect the agent is said to produce. Thus we may assert that some conjuror, excellent at his art, made a rabbit disappear although we do not know what events caused the disappearance, nor hold any particular beliefs about them. Similarly, upon seeing a horse running away from a stable and the stable door swinging on its hinges, we may believe that the horse broke the door. We can produce justifications for believing both agency-statements. An ade- quate explanation of agency must show the source of the justification. (b) We sometimes assert that something was the agent of an effect when the event causing the effect can be identified without reference to the agent. And sometimes something is said to be the agent of an effect when the event f, identified by reference to the agent, does not cause the effect but it causes another event g which does cause the effect. Thus we say that the gas boiler closed itself down when the event which caused the stopping of the gas flow was the closing of a valve. And we say that the cat opened the door when the cause of the door's opening was the release of a spring which was caused by some movement of the cat. An adequate explanation must accom- modate these cases. (c) As a matter of fact, we do distinguish, in unphilosophical moments at least, between things that a non-human object makes happen and changes that it undergoes. Thus if a non- human object makes something else change, this is a different kind of "doing" from it itself merely changing. But we also say that some movements of such objects are not mere movements. And we signal this by certain kinds of description. Thus, if a dog's paw rises, say in response to a command, we say that</page><page sequence="4">I98 DAVID HIRSCHMANN the dog raised its paw. But if it is pulled up by a piece of string, we say only that the dog's paw rose. And we can find the same distinction made in the case of non-living objects. So any adequate explanation of agency must either explain this distinction or justify its obliteration. 2. The ellipsis thesis The import of the ellipsis thesis is that agency-statements can be reduced to causal statements. An agency statement is said to mean the same as some causal statement because of some necessary truth. In order to allow that a person can intelligibly assert or believe that the horse kicked down the door when nobody saw it do it, the ellipsis thesis must be formulated with an existential event statement in it and not a description. I shall use "A made e happen" as one general form of an agency statement, where A is an object and e is an event. By "A changed" I mean that some event of A's changing occurred. (This is to be understood to cover continued states as causes). Then we may formulate the ellipsis thesis as (N) If A is a non-human object, then necessarily, the proposition that A made e happen is true if and only if the compound proposition that there is an event f, which is some change of A, and f caused e is true. Now is (N) true? That is, is it necessarily true that an agency-proposition implies a causal proposition and that a causal-proposition implies an agency-proposition? The remain- der of my paper will have a bearing on these questions, but in this section I shall confine myself to some remarks on the source of the necessity of the mutual implication. It must be remembered that I am concerned only with non- human agents and so if it is a fact that human agents can pro- duce effects without changes in them being causes of these effects, this is not relevant to (N). Whenever a non-human object is said to produce an effect or make something happen, then it makes sense to ask how it produces the effect or by what means. There are two reasons which may be given to support this. First we can always expand the statement that A produced the effect e into the</page><page sequence="5">INANIMATE AGENCY 199 statement that A produced the effect e by doing something (by some means). And although the inital expansion may state that the means was some other effect produced by A, we can always continue the expansion until we arrive at a statement of some change of A's state where no reference is made to an object other than A. But I have already argued that given any agency statement, we may not be able to state what I here call the means. So why do we believe that the expansion is always possible? A partial answer can be given by exhibiting the closely entwined uses of "agent", "produce", "effect", "cause" and "event" in relation to non-human objects, but the substantial answer is found elsewhere. Brown has argued convincingly that agency-statements have an explanatory force, indicated by the fact that inanimate agents are called causes and that they are said to produce effects or make things happen. The point of picking out some object as the agent of an effect is to indicate that the object was responsible for the effect. In other words, the explanation of the occurrence of the effect is to be found if the agent is examined. But we countenance only causal explanations of effects produced by non-human agents. This is exemplified by our bafflement if someone insists that the sun ripens the crops but no changes occur in the sun which cause the ripen- ing. But we cannot say that his assertion is self-contradictory, for he may have in mind some other mode of explanation unknown to us, though we can say that his assertions are unintelligible to us. That the only explanation of how an agent produces its effects is causal is not a necessary truth, except by convention. It is best considered as the statement of a prin- ciple which governs our understanding of inanimate (or soulless) objects in an inanimate (or soulless) world. Considered this way we can see why not only do agency-statements imply causal ones, but in what sense the implication may be said to be necessary. And further we can see why part of what we mean by an agency-statement is some causal statement. Exposure to enough people who entertain other explanations of inanimate agency might lead us to correct this last. The ground for our belief in the ellipsis thesis is a belief about the nature of the inanimate world. It is this belief which enables us to treat non-human living</page><page sequence="6">200 DAVID HIRSCHMANN agents, as they are objects within the physical world, on a par with inanimate agents. Brown argues5 that for all agents that act upon objects, the question, "How?" is appropriate, and inanimate objects can only perform actions in so far as they act upon other inanimate objects. However, since I shall argue that inanimate objects, as well as animals, can act in other ways, I have not restricted the argument to one thing acting upon another. I will have to show that the question, "How did it do it ?" is appropriate in these other cases of non- human action. Now the manner in which agency-statements have explana- tory power is captured in part by the ellipsis thesis; something A is the agent of some effect only if that effect is caused by an event which can be described as a movement or change of A, and if an effect is caused by an event which can be described as a movement or change of A, then A is the agent of that effect. But these conditions alone do not ensure the explanatory power of the ascription of agency. For it may be that the event f which causes the effect can be described as a change or move- ment of A, but the explanation of that effect refers to the eventf but describes it without reference to A. In some cases where this happens, we then deny that A was the agent. In others we still say that A was the agent. As stated, the ellipsis thesis fails to maintain these differences. I shall reject it not only as a sufficient condition for A's being an agent but also as a necessary condition. 3. The identification of the agent The examples mentioned in my condition (b) for an ade- quate account of inanimate agency are directly related to the problem raised in the previous paragraph. If events are particu- lars then they can be described in more than one way. The events we are interested in are causes of effects and can be described as some movement or other change of an object (physical entity or stuff). The description will also refer to that which moves or changes. How do we justify identifying A as the agent if A is not referred to in the description of the cause event? In general, how do we identify the agent? 6 ibid. pp. 34-35.</page><page sequence="7">INANIMATE AGENCY 20I There are some cases which are straightforward and are covered by the ellipsis thesis. The ball is said to break the window because the cause of the window being broken is the event described by the statement that the ball moved into contact with the window with a certain volocity. There are alternative descriptions of this event, but, at least at an every- day level of analysis, the descriptions will be of a movement, however characterised, of the ball. Hence, as the ellipsis thesis requires, the ball is the agent. (I assume throughout this paper that we have an account of "f is the cause of e".) Another case demonstrates difficulties which can arise even with the foregoing. The car knocked down the dog. Here we attribute the effect of the dog's being knocked down to the car and not the bumper, although the cause-event may be described by "the bumper while travelling at speed s came into contact with the dog". As long as the bumper is attached to the car, we say that the car is the agent. To such a facetious example, it is tempting to reply, "Of course, the bumper is not the agent, it's merely a part of the car". However, this will not pass as it stands, for we say that the fan and not the car cools the engine even though the fan is part of the car. Nevertheless the spirit of the answer is correct. It introduces us to one idea that I think is central to an account of non-human agency, if not agency in general. There are many cases, as I have said, where agency is attributed to a non- human object but the cause-event can be identified without reference to this object. Typical among such cases are the actions of animals. We say that the dog bit the man although the event that caused the man's being bitten can be identified without reference to the dog, laborious though that would be. And although, of course, we would not pick out the dog as agent if the jaws were not attached to it, the notion of physical connexion is too vague to account for all cases. I think that the essential notion involved at least in every- day contexts, is that of a whole and this is closely related to the kinds of empirical concepts we employ in judgments about what we perceive. These again are reflected in the kinds of explana- tion we think appropriate for certain events. Thus we say that the ball broke the window because the explanation we offer of why the cause-event occurred is in terms, in part, of the</page><page sequence="8">202 DAVID HIRSCHMANN ball. For example, John threw it (the ball). We say that the car, and not the bumper, knocked down the dog because an explanation of why the bumper hit the dog (moved into contact with it) is in terms of what caused the car to move. Again, the dog, and not the jaws, bit the man because an explanation why the jaws moved in a certain way is, for example, that the man annoyed the dog. And these are the explanations we accept of why the agent changed to produce the effect. That those objects we pick out as agent depend upon the explanation we offer of the causes of their effects means that what we pick out is relative to certain beliefs and interests. For there is usually more than one acceptable explanation and which one is accepted will depend upon why we are inter- ested in some situation, the level of analysis appropriate to that interest, and what explanation we believe is true. 4. The accordion effect I turn now to the other kind of case I mentioned in relation to my condition (b). We are familiar with the fact that descrip- tions of human actions can be expanded or contracted. Thus we say either that John pulled the trigger of the gun with the result that Smith was shot or that John shot Smith by pulling the trigger of the gun. Feinberg calls this, aptly, "the accordion effect'.6 I shall argue that it applies to inanimate action descriptions as well. Davidson expressly denies this.7 He holds that the accordion effect is a mark of human agency, for it only applies when the agent is a person. It does not apply in non-human cases where the notion of agency is eliminable. In support of the claim that the effect is a mark of agency, he contrasts two examples. IfJohn swung the bat which hit the ball which broke a window, then John broke the window. But neither the bat nor its movement broke the window, though the movement of the bat caused the breakage. Whatever the reason why the bat is not said to be the agent, there are many examples where the accordion effect applies unproblematically to non-human objects. If the rat pulled the string which released a catch which released a spring which 6Joel Feinberg, "Action and Responsibility" in Philosophy in America ed. by Max Black, London: Allen and Unwin I965. 7 "Agency" pp. 17-I8.</page><page sequence="9">INANIMATE AGENCY 203 opened a door, then the rat opened the door. On the other hand, there are cases where the effect does not appear to apply. If billiard ball A hit ball B which hit ball C which broke a glass, then did A break the glass? I think that the only reason for denying this is that we usually intend by "the ball broke the glass" that the ball did it by making contact with the glass. But since we say that a vibrating body, some distance from it, can break a glass, we should hesitate before asserting that "the ball broke the glass" means, in part, that the ball made contact with the glass. What we can say is that it means at least that the ball produced the breaking of the glass by some means, which is true in this case. The fact that it sounds odd to our ears is explained when we realise that we rarely, if ever, wish to assert that the ball was the agent of this effect. And this is because our interest in the situation centres upon what caused A to move with the consequence that the glass broke, rather than what caused B to move with the same consequence. Billiard balls do not move of their own accord and so in such causal situations as the one above, we pick out as agent that which "initiates the causal process". The agent in such situations is often a human being, but it need not be so. The engine, and not a carriage in between, is said to make the last carriage of a train move, by turning its wheels, because an engine is the kind of thing which can move of its own accord, or generate its own movement. I shall return to this notion later. So my thesis is that the accordion effect does apply in cases of inanimate as well as animal agency. If A's changing causes e which causes f which causes g, then A produces g or makes g happen. (Of course, the role that the change of A plays in the cause of g may become less and less central as time proceeds, but the restrictions on the application of the accordion effect to take into account this point require a general discussion of the transitivity of the causal relation between events.) The application of the accordion effect will lead to more than one thing being the agent of some effect. If A's changing causes B to change and B's changing causes C to change, then A makes B change and makes C change, and B also makes C change. But the means by which A makes C change are clearly different from the means by which B makes C change. Any</page><page sequence="10">204 DAVID HIRSCHMANN sense of paradox remaining may be dispelled by comparing this with a similar feature of responsibility. The zoo director is responsible for the keeper's being responsible for the monkey's condition. The director is also responsible for the monkey's condition. But the ways in which, and reasons for which they are responsible are different. My reasons for rejecting the ellipsis thesis may now be summarised. They are that something may be an agent of an effect although the event that caused the effect is not described by reference to it, but a part of it, and also upon the fact that what we select as agent depends not only upon our belief that it is involved in the explanation of how the effect was produced, but also upon what we believe is the appropriate kind of explanation of the occurrence of the cause event, even if unknown at the time. We do not need to have an explicit explanation of why this event occurred, but only a belief that an explanation can be given in terms of the agent. Similarly, we do not need an explicit explanation of how some change of the agent, or part of it, produced the effect, but only a belief that some change causally produced it. These reasons are still very vague, but in the following sec- tions I shall try to make them less so. However, even as they stand, they cast doubt upon the ellipsis thesis as a statement of meaning. "A made e happen" does not mean the same as "there is an event, f, which is a changing of A and f caused e and there is believed to be an explanation of why f occurred in terms of A", for what is essential is that whoever states that A made e happen should believe that there is an explanation of whyf occurred which he would accept, for this is part of what we shall understand by his stating this. 5. Parts and Wholes The account I have given so far of certain cases where we attribute an effect to a non-human object relies heavily on the notion of one thing being a part of another. I now want to develop an account of the part-whole relation which not only covers the cases I have mentioned but also shows in what way the explanation of, or explanatory belief about, the cause of the effect to be attributed to an agent can determine which object we select as agent.</page><page sequence="11">INANIMATE AGENCY 205 If we consider a description of the events in a causal chain which resulted in an effect, then sometimes the object to which we attribute the effect does not appear in any description of the events which caused the effect. That is, no event in the chain is described by a statement that A changed. The crane lifted the load, but the events which successively caused this effect are described by the statement that the winch-engine's turning caused the cable's being wound up which caused the load to rise. The crane is left out of the account. Now my point is that however much we increase the detail and accuracy of the event description there will be no event described as a change of the crane, but only a change of something which may be said to belong to the crane. As we shall see the sense of "belong" here is not simple ownership. However, if we decrease the detail and accuracy of the description, then in the event- description the sentence, "the crane changed" may be used. But I shall argue that where an expression of this form occurs in a description of an event-causal process, it means either that some part of the crane changed or the crane, as a single object, moved. The argument is unavoidably circuitous. We can say both that the winch's turning caused the crane to lift the load and also that the winch's turning caused the cable to lift the load. But whereas this latter effect may be restated as "the cable's winding in on the winch caused the load to rise", "the crane lifted the load" cannot be restated as "the crane's change caused the load to rise". For the crane did not move. It remained firmly fixed on the ground, and any angular movement was not the cause of the load's rising but was a further effect of whatever caused the load to rise. The change which caused this effect is described naturally as a change in rather than a change of the crane. But this un- certain grammatical point serves only as a guide to the reason why we attribute the effect of the load's rising to the crane. An initial explanation of this attribution is that the engine, winch and cable are parts of the crane, one part's changing has an effect on the others, and one of those parts changing causes the load to rise. This is borne out if we consider occa- sions when we do not attribute an effect to the crane although one part's changing causes an effect. If a strut breaks off the crane and breaks a box, we do not say that the crane broke the</page><page sequence="12">206 DAVID HIRSCHMANN box. Here the strut's breaking off causes effects in other parts of the crane, but these effects are not even part of the cause of the box breaking. The strut is however part of the crane. So when do we say that something attached to the crane is not a part of it? A flag attached to the cable is attached to the crane but it is not part of it. At an every-day level of analysis, or at the level used by civil engineers, whatever the flag's changes are, they cause no changes in the parts of the crane. If the flag drops off the cable because of a frayed string, then the effects of this event of the flag's dropping are not attributed to the crane or any part of it. These points suggest the following necessary conditions for an object to be a whole, in the sense that I have been using the notion. 0 is a whole where pi ... p,, are its parts, only if (i) it is an object which can be individuated in the sense that it is an instance of a kind k of object different from other kinds and it can be distinguished from other instances of the same kind; (ii) pi, . .. p.P are objects which can be individuated in the same sense; (iii) 0 changes if and only if a change of p, causes a change of pj; (iv) If a certain number of the objects pi ... , pn, less than n are missing, then 0 ceases to be an instance of the kind, K. These conditions may not be sufficient for an object's being a whole, but if they are necessary, then we can learn some- thing from them about the part-whole relationship (or that relationship involved in the cases of agency discussed in this paper. There are other uses of the part-whole distinction.) It is important to notice that something is judged to be a whole relative to some "level of analysis". For example, condition (ii) can be satisfied if we use an engineering manual to describe the parts of a car, but cannot be satisfied if we attempt to describe its parts at a molecular level. And at one level, p may be a part and at another a whole. Thus the causal explanation we offer of the cause of the effect can show what objects we take as wholes or parts. Condition (iv) of course is rarely if ever satisfiable explicitly, but I think we can say that</page><page sequence="13">INANIMATE AGENCY 207 anyone who believes that 0 is a whole ought to believe that it ceases to be a whole if some number of its parts are removed. Further, we sometimes may say that 0 is an object which is a whole, although we cannot specify what the parts are. We may claim that although some parts are themselves wholes, there are objects which are parts of wholes, but are themselves simple (have no parts). Fortunately, this need not concern us here. For our purposes a relative distinction be- tween simples, parts and wholes is sufficient. And the distinc- tion is not only relative to the ways that we classify objects. It is also relative to the explanations we offer of the changes of those objects. A ball may be considered to be a whole in some contexts, but where we explain the movement of a ball in terms of Newtonian mechanics, taking the ball to be an object with a mass and velocity, then the ball is taken to be a simple and not a whole. Similarly, when we explain the movement of a car by saying that an object hit it, thus imparting a force which resulted in the car's moving, we treat the car as a simple object. But if we explain the movement by saying that some- thing made the wheels turn, with the result that the car moved, we treat the car as a whole. I now suggest (AN) that a necessary condition for a whole 0 being the agent of an effect e, where pi and pj are among its parts, is that e is caused by a change of p; and this change of pi is caused by a change of pi. Where a change in pj causes e but is itself caused by a change in something not part of 0 then 0 is not the agent of the effect. This captures what we mean by saying that 0 is not involved in the cause of e. How- ever, this is not a sufficient condition for 0 to be an agent. If a bolt in a crane shears and this causes a strut to fall resulting in a broken crate of oranges, we do not say that the crane broke the crate. If we then add a further necessary condition to the effect that the change in pi causes a change in all the other parts of 0, this is possibly too strong and the two conditions taken jointly are still insufficient. If a dog's tail wags causing a cup to break, the dog is the agent of the effect even though whatever caused the tail to wag left its nose unaffected. And we may say that the shearing of a bolt in a crane causes effects in all the other parts of the crane. I do not know how to formu- late a necessary and sufficient condition for a whole to be an</page><page sequence="14">208 DAVID HIRSCHMANN agent of an effect. There is too much variation between cases and contexts, some of which may be accounted for later. But I believe that (AN) is a necessary condition. One feature of changes in wholes that should be noted here is that where 0 is said to change because pi causes pj, the statement that 0 changed does not entail simply that an event occurred. It entails that two events occurred and one was the cause of the other. Further the statement that the crane lifted the weight entails at least five statements; (i) the weight was lifted, (ii) a part pi changed, (iii) a part pj changed, (iv) the change of pi caused the change of pj; and (v) the change of pj caused the lifting of the weight. We cannot therefore say that the crane was the agent because it changed and this change produced the effect, for there is no single event corresponding to a change of the crane among the truth conditions for the agency statement. Put another way, there is no change of the crane over and above the change of its parts. However, there are some cases where we wish to say an object changes although it is a whole. The whole crane may move. But we can only say that this movement of the crane causes some effect, different from the effect of a change in some of its parts, if we attempt to treat the crane as a simple and as a whole at one and the same time. To fail to notice this leads to difficulties and paradox. To show this I shall return to the dog which was knocked down by the car. As in the case of the crane, we can give two different accounts of the events which caused the dog to fall over. We can say that the wheels turned thus causing the car to move into contact with the dog which resulted in the dog's falling over. Or we can say that the wheels' turning caused the bumper's moving into contact with the dog and this caused the dog's falling over. Now there appears to be no problem about saying that the wheels' turning caused the car's moving and also caused the bumper's moving. Further, these are different events, as the movements are noticeably different. But a problem arises if we say that both of these events have the same effect, for then</page><page sequence="15">INANIMATE AGENCY 209 what is the relation between them? Two events may both cause the same effect in the sense that they are both jointly sufficient for the effect, but each alone is not. But here the car's moving into contact with the dog and the bumper's moving into contact with the dog are events each said to be sufficient for the effect. One solution is to admit that in this case the effect was overdetermined. But this is not a rare case. It is typical of any case where we say that a whole moved and the movement caused some effect. And if Nature is grossly overdetermined we may doubt the usefulness of the concept of event-causality. Another move is to say that although there are two events here, they are related as part to whole. I suspect that there are sufficient problems about the identi- fication of events (which I have glossed over in this paper) without trying to impose a part-whole distinction on them. A third way out is to cease to speak of events as particulars. If we consider just the relations between propositions, taken normally to be about events, then perhaps we can exhibit the entailment between the proposition that the car hit the dog and the proposition that the bumper moved into contact with the dog, given that the bumper is attached to the car. But this would then raise problems about explanation. I shall suggest a fourth solution to this problem. It is not the only one and doubtless has its own difficulties. If the car is treated as a simple then it can be said that the car's moving into contact with the dog caused the dog to fall over. But when the car is treated as a whole, any effect of its movement is an effect of the movement of at least one part of it. So in this case we can say that the event which caused the dog to fall down is the event of the car's moving into contact with the dog and it is also the event of the bumper's moving into contact with the dog. The event of the car's moving is not the same as the event of the bumper's moving, but this does not conflict with the identity claim. For every claim that the event of the car's moving has an effect, where the movement of the car is different from the movement of any of its parts, is only literally correct if the car is considered as a simple object. When the car is said to be caused to move by the wheels turning it is clear that the car is being considered as a whole. Any effect is properly attributable to the car only if some part of</page><page sequence="16">210 DAVID HIRSCHMANN the car causes that effect and the change in the part is caused by a change in another part. We can now see why the two accounts of the events leading up to the falling down of the dog are apparently incompatible. In the first account, it is said that the wheels' turning caused the car to move into contact with the dog which caused the dog to fall over. When it is said that the car moved into contact with the dog, the car is taken to be a simple, thus something which can literally change and whose changes can have effects. In the second version of the event sequence, the event which caused the dog to fall is described as a change of part of the car. But it is the same event as described in the first version. Where the car is taken to be a whole, the statement that the car moved entails that, for some pi and pj (i) pi changed, (ii) pj changed, (iii) the change of pi caused the change of pj, (iv) any effect attributed to the car is an effect of some change in pj. Thus any statement that a whole moved entails, as in the case of the crane, that a causal relation held between two events describable as changes of two parts of the whole. 6. Kinds of action Now this account of the whole-part relationship suggests a way of showing the difference between the statement that the dog raised its paw and the statement that the dog's paw rose while not denying that the first statement entails some causal statement. The dog's raising its paw can be treated in the same manner as the crane's lifting its arm, since we can say that the dog is a whole. Related to the statement that the crane lifted its arm is a statement about a series of events, each a change of some part of the crane, and causally related so that the penultimate event caused the arm to go up. Apart from the fact that the final effect is a change in a part of itself and not a change in some- thing else, these statements of events fulfil the necessary condition for an effect being attributed to the crane. Now since we often have occasion to describe what an inanimate object</page><page sequence="17">INANIMATE AGENCY 2 I which is a whole does in cases like this, and since there appear to be no reasons for distinguishing these attributions from those discussed already, it is proper to describe what the crane does as an action. But it does not act upon something else. It acts upon itself. It is preferable to say this rather than the crane simply acts or executes a movement, because it stresses the dependency of this type of action on the more fundamental one of one thing acting upon another. It is important to notice that an agent cannot act upon itself unless the effect which is attributed to it is caused by a change of at least one part of the agent and this cause is again caused by at least one other part's changing. We may also say that an agent moves itself only if this movement is caused by the movement of at least one part and the part or parts which move are caused to move by a change in at least one other part. These necessary conditions for a thing to act upon itself and for a thing to move itself, weak though they are, are still sufficient to show that the truth conditions for "the dog raised its paw" and "the dog moved from the door by walking" are very different from the truth conditions of "the dog's paw rose" and "the dog was moved by the scruff of its neck from the door". Now only a little reflection will show that these conditions are not sufficient for the two kinds of action I have characterised. Thus if a dog is lifted bodily from the door by someone, then we would not want to say that it moved itself. Yet if the neces- sary condition for something to move itself is also sufficient, this is what it does. For when the dog moves, the parts (ana- tomically described) act and react upon one another. Where- ever one lifts a dog one part will move before another and cause (or be part of the cause) of another part's moving. If these causal reactions did not occur, the dog would slide between one's arms like jelly. This suggests a further necessary condition for an object to move itself. If we consider the dog as a simple object, then the cause of its movement is attributed to the lifting of one's arms. But in those cases where we do want to say that some object moved itself, we find that when the object is considered as a simple there is no action of any other object (or event not involving the object) which can be described as the cause of the movement. Thus a necessary</page><page sequence="18">212 DAVID HIRSCHANN condition for an object to move itself is that it is not the case that the object, considered as a simple, is caused to move by some other object. However, my purpose in this paper is to defend the thesis that agency statements imply causal statements (for non- human actions). But the model of animal action, which I have based upon the part-whole distinction, is only acceptable if it captures all the clear cases of animal action and rejects all clear cases of sheer change. To see if this is possible one must investigate at least the structure of actions described in terms of their goals, for example searchings and huntings. There is one feature of the model which is worth noting in this context. The model allows us to limit our attention to those actions which are performed by the agent by moving itself or acting on itself. Thus, by virtue of the accordion effect, instead of saying that an agent produced an effect on something else by acting upon itself, we can say that the agent acted upon itself with the result that the effect occurred. And equally, when an agent acts upon itself, we may redescribe the effect produced in terms of its cause. If the statement that a duck is searching for its young can be shown to be a redescription of an agent acting upon itself or moving itself in terms of the causes of this action, then one will have moved further towards the assimilation of animal agency to inanimate (non-living) agency. Moreover, this model enables one to see the basic relationship between a behavioural and a physiological explana- tion of some animal behaviour. Roughly, the former will state what caused the animal to produce some effect (perform an action) whereas the latter will explain how it produced it. My last point has some bearing on a general theory of action. It is often said that an action is a species of event. But if we consider the sentence form "A produced e", then what we call the action may be either the effect produced (some state of affairs) or the producing of the effect. I believe that we may be misled into thinking that the action is an event because we fail to notice that the statement of the action in terms of the effect is always in terms of the production of that effect. Thus the action is the breaking of the glass and not the glass's being broken. The same is true in the case of bodily movements where we say that the action is the raising of the arm and not</page><page sequence="19">INANIMATE AGENCY 213 the arm's rising or being raised. The account that I have given of non-human action has this consequence. Although an event occurs when the agent acts, the action is not that event. The event, as effect, is attributed to the agent if certain causal conditions are fulfilled. Because the event is caused in a certain way the agent is said to produce the effect and its action is the producing or causing of this effect. Even if some effects are attributed to humans for very different reasons, I believe that the analysis of human action will be misguided if such actions are treated simply as events.</page></plain_text>
