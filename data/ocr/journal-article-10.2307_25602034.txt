<plain_text><page sequence="1">BENJAMIN KIM Generating a National Sublime: Wordsworth's The River Duddon and The Guide to the Lakes GENERALLY CONSIDERED, 1820 IS WELL PAST THE ZENITH OF WORDS worth's power as a poet. Both The River Duddon and The Guide to the Lakes, appearing together in 1820, are usually read in comparison with, and in terms of, work written very close to the century mark, as narratives of self and as celebrations of Wordsworth's blessed region. In Wordsworth's Po etry, Geoffrey Hartman writes that "the distance between 'After-thought' [the closing poem in The River Duddon] and 'Tintern Abbey' is not great."1 For Hartman, "After-thought" displays that old apocalyptic fire which is generally quenched in the late work by a conventional religion that serves to quiet the process of self-questioning. Hartman is generous toward "After-thought," but the poem's worth is nevertheless defined by a "dis tance" to work two-decades old, effectively portraying much of the inter vening time as a period of stagnation. James K. Chandler makes a similar appraisal when he opines that the ideas of "After-thought" are "essentially unchanged from those expressed in the lines added to The Ruined Cottage between January and March of 1798. "2 Chandler's interest lies in Words worth's "apostasy"; once the conversion has been made, Nature is Burkean, "wisdom without reflection."3 Although the central concerns of both critics' work are different, Chandler's "reflection" is something very close to Hartman's, tied to the rupture of boundaries, not the guarding of them.

Daniel Robinson has re cently summarized critical views of The River Duddon: "... critics still dis miss the sequence as a conventionally didactic loco-descriptive poem of Wordsworth's later years."4 There is something about Wordsworth's conservatism that invites one to take it on its own terms, as non-evolving and defensive. In September 1819, the month following Peterloo, Wordsworth chose to write a senti mental poem noteworthy only for its deliberate exclusion of recent events: "Yet will I temperately rejoice; / Wide is the range, and free the choice / Of undiscordant themes."5 The late poetry is conventional in that it ideal izes the past and argues against social change, and it is didactic in its moral izing tone. But Wordsworth's choice to stress continuity and harmony does not necessarily mean that the late work is unthinking, or that it is a watered-down repetition of earlier poetry. The effort to present an ideal ized Britain without discord is a reaction that Wordsworth developed in response to domestic and international conflict, and this surface harmony is, I will argue, ideologically and philosophically complex. Contrary to their critical reception, The River Duddon and The Guide to the Lakes are not simply celebrations of the local. As expressions of nationalism, their burden is to encompass the national through the local, and they achieve this aim through an aesthetic that is highly theoretical. The River Duddon and The Guide have roots in times of Wordsworth's most sustained political activity, the Peninsular War and the Westmorland election of 1818, documented by three key prose works: Regarding the Con vention of Cintra (1809),6 and the Two Addresses to the Freeholders of Westmorland (1818). The Guide to the Lakes started from Wordsworth's in troduction to Wilkinson's Select Views in Cumberland, Westmorland, and Lancashire (1810), but Theresa Kelley argues that Wordsworth began plan ning a guide to the Lake District much earlier, in 1806.7 As for the Duddon sonnets, nineteen were written in 1818, the year of the Westmorland elec tion. Two sonnets were recycled from an even earlier time and rewritten, 4.

The grouping of The River Duddon and The Guide was more than arbitrary, de spite their myriad origins. Mary Wordsworth, in a letter to Sara Hutchin son, wrote that the Duddon sonnets "all together compose one poem,"8 and the fly title of the 1820 volume states that the Guide was republished because of "a consciousness of its having been written in the same spirit which dictated several of the poems, and from a belief that it will tend ma terially to illustrate them."9 Wordsworth put more effort into Cintra than into any other prose work. Stephen Gill proposes that Wordsworth's anxiety in composition was due to the fact that the tract demanded a level of political thinking to which Wordsworth was unaccustomed.10 I propose instead that Cintra signaled a reawakening of political interest and a reorientation of position. Chandler, Heather Glen, David Simpson,11 and a number of "new historicist" critics have characterized the work at the start of the nineteenth century as in tensely lyrical and withdrawn from the political realm. Certainly, Lyrical Ballads of 1798, read through the 1794 letters to William Mathews, stands as a critique of governmental policy through its description of domestic rupture (fallen houses, dissolved families, degraded flocks). In responding to an external threat, Cintra reflects a different attitude towards state integrity and expresses a faith in existing relations that are described in Burkean terms, despite the fact that the domestic affections remain central. At the same time that Wordsworth was forming a new political orienta tion, he was developing an aesthetics of the sublime. W.J. B. Owen argues that a recognizable vocabulary of the sublime enters Wordsworth's dis course in 1790, but finds most of the definitive examples in the different versions of the Guide and its related manuscripts.12 Owen and Smyser date the most pertinent manuscript, "The Sublime and the Beautiful," between 1811 and the end of 1812 (2: 128), while Theresa Kelley argues that the manuscript is a collection of ideas formed much earlier, and traces Words 8.

If a negotiated range is accepted, Wordsworth's theorizing of the sublime is roughly concomitant to the for mation of political ideas in reaction to the Peninsular War. Kelley calls "The Sublime and the Beautiful" the only "philosophical account of the mind's aesthetics Wordsworth attempted" (23). Owen believes that the manuscript was abandoned because Wordsworth lost his taste for systematic definition in favor of the descriptive mode of Select Views and The Guide to the Lakes. I will argue that a theory of the sublime, far from being aban doned, became central to Wordsworth's thinking, but was dissociated from a universal reason and instead tied to a national sensibility. Of particular importance is the formulation found in "The Sublime and the Beautiful": "... the body of this [sublime] sensation would be found to resolve itself into three component parts: a sense of individual form or forms; a sense of duration; and a sense of power (2: 351). Concerning the Convention of Cintra Cintra is an immense accomplishment not for its style nor for its contribu tion to political thought, but for its aesthetic unity: comprehensive in scope, it carries Wordsworth's earlier local concerns into the world of for eign affairs with a remarkable consistency. Because the tract comments negatively on the British government's policies during the American War and during the early days of the French Revolution, Stephen Gill describes the work as "a Tract for the Times with a distinctly radical orientation" (277). Gordon Kent Thomas, the author of the only full-length study of Cintra, approaches the text as "unquestionably a strong statement of demo cratic faith."13 Most, however, have approached Cintra as a conservative work, an ex ample of Wordsworth's "apostasy" (Thomas 151?55). This judgment is due to the work's strong echoes of Burke's counterrevolutionary writings, fleshed-out not only by critics who regard Cintra as conservative, but by the tract's staunchest defenders, such as Thomas. Burke's influence on the tract is undeniable; but does this then automatically make the tract a con servative one? Thomas believes that Cintra has been received as conserva tive because of the tract's robust nationalism, and argues that critics have mistakenly projected the modern, negative connotations of nationalism on to a past when none existed. Nationalism and the belief in the universal right to national self-determination are, of course, at odds, and the distinc tion is perhaps a great deal clearer to the modern reader. As Thomas notes, most of the opposition to the Convention used the latter as a rallying cry. 13- Gordon Kent Thomas, Wordsworth's Dirge and Promise: Napoleon, Wellington, and the Convention of Cintra (Lincoln: U of Nebraska P, 1971) 164.</page><page sequence="5">WORDSWORTH'S RIVER DUDDON &amp; GUIDE TO LAKES 53 But the widespread opposition to the Convention perhaps suggests that the former was at work as well: here, a chance to deal the competition a major blow was missed. Wordsworth passionately believed in Spanish independ ence, but this by no means exhausts the debate about his motivations. Felicia Hemans, who believed in an Englishness beyond British borders, found her poetic voice during the Peninsular War, and was able to say, with rather too much ease, "Be free, gallant Spaniards, or Die!"14 Wordsworth's tract shares in the strategic identification between per sonal and national independence. The latter is presented as the expression of the former, but national independence, as a political goal, takes prece dence. The tie between the two exists in the "affections": "... the man, who in his age feels no regret for the ruined honour of other Nations, must be poor in sympathy for the honour of his own Country; and that, if he be wanting here towards that which circumstances the whole, he neither has?nor can have?a social regard for the lesser communities which Country includes." Where there is no love for national independence," writes Wordsworth, "a people are not a society, but a herd" (i: 327). No tice that what should be described as the lack of individual independence, a herd mentality, is tied to national independence. Indeed, when Words worth turns from national distinctions to class distinctions, he conflates the two independences, and the reader isn't sure to which he is referring. The laboring man "leans less upon others than any man in the community" (1: 326), and the "Peasant, and he who lives by the fair reward of manual la bour, has ordinarily a larger sense of proportion of his gratifications de pendent upon these thoughts?than, for the most part, men in other classes have"; the "poorest Peasant, in an unsubdued land, feels this pride" (1: 328). Just what exactly are these "thoughts," this "pride"? Because Words worth adds the modifier, "in an unsubdued land," these feelings are clearly meant to relate to the national affections as well as to the affections of the domestic circle. Wordsworth makes the connection even more directly in asserting that the "whole courage of his Country is in [the peasant's] breast" (1: 328). Alone, the existence of the core principles "freedom" and "independ ence" does not make the tract liberal because Cintra valorizes the "com mon passions" instead of individual political rights. "Liberty" only extends to the individual through national liberty and national self-determination because Cintra lacks the necessary bit of abstraction: when Wordsworth discusses "the People," he is talking about the British People, or the Span 14- Felicia Browne (Hemans), "The Call of Liberty," in The Domestic Affections, and Other Poems (London, 1812) 143.

Nations have a character bound to past traditions, and a brotherhood of nations arises from the love of national in dependence, not from the recognition of any particular political system. The transition between individual rights and national rights is just too easy: "I apply these rules, taken from the intercourse between individuals, to the conduct of the large bodies of men, or of nations towards each other, be cause these are nothing but aggregates of individuals" (i: 267). No general will here. Although Wordsworth exhorts the leaders to "speak boldly to the People: and let the People write and speak boldly" (1: 332), the lower classes are clearly not involved in this dialogue: "In the conduct of this ar gument I am not speaking to the humbler ranks of society: it is unnecessary: they trust in nature, and are safe" (1: 328). In downplaying Burke's influ ence on Cintra, Richard Gravil writes: "To Burke, universal benevolence was a fatal abstraction; to Hazlitt, nationhood was. Wordsworth, as he does with all antinomies, comes to refuse the choice."15 On the contrary, the choice is made: Cintra stresses the importance of personal liberty, but whenever the two come into conflict, Wordsworth chooses national liberty.16 If one were to look at Cintra in isolation and only with regard to the sit uation in Spain and Portugal, the rigidity of the hierarchy between the two "independences" appears to be a concession to the political task at hand, to the lack of developed internal relations: Wordsworth perhaps had to lean on the idea of national independence because of his distrust in the Span ish, whom he tended to conflate with the Portuguese.17 But where does Wordsworth display the "democratic faith" that Thomas finds? When Wordsworth demonstrates "Those Principles, By Which Alone the Independ 15- Richard Gravil, Wordsworth's Bardic Vocation, 1787-1842 (New York: Palgrave, 2003) 234. 16. Wordsworth writes, "It is a common saying among those who profess to be lovers of civil liberty, and give themselves some credit for understanding it,?that, if a Nation be not free, it is mere dust in the balance whether the slavery be bred at home, or comes from abroad; be of their own suffering, or a stranger's imposing. They see little of the under ground part of the tree of liberty, and know less of the nature of man, who can think thus" (1: 322). ". . . it is some consolation to those who look back upon the history of the world to know?that, even without civil liberty, society may possess?diffused through its inner re cesses in the mind of its humblest members?something of dignified enjoyment. But, with out national independence, this is impossible. The difference, between inbred oppression and that which is from without, is essential. . . " (1: 326). 17. In an unpublished poem, "Pelayo," dated by De Selincourt between 1808 and 1810, Wordsworth writes: "Not uninvited this malignity! / Full long relinquishing a precious dower / By Gothic virtue won, secured by an oath / Of King and people pledged in mutual troth, / The Spaniard hath approached on servile knee / The native Ruler all too willingly" (54-59).</page><page sequence="7">WORDSWORTH'S RIVER DUDDON &amp; GUIDE TO LAKES 55 ence and Freedom can be Preserved or Recovered," he turns to Britain, and gives Britain's class relations the patina of an ideal situation, part of which is the condition that the peasants' affections, held up as societal glue, are a "social inheritance" beyond political discussion. Cintra's conservative core is reinforced by Wordsworth's actions and writings in response to an event a decade later, the 1818 Westmorland elec tion.18 The Two Addresses to the Freeholders of Westmorland19 is remarkably similar to Cintra, and erects the same ideal network of affections. If Cintra, a tract on international relations, tends to focus too much on idealizing the domestic circle, the Two Addresses, concerned with a local election, devotes a surprising amount of space to the nation and its place in the world. Al though the political situation had changed a great deal between 1808 and 1818, the justifications remained the same. In 1818, Wordsworth justified his support for the Lowther interest by appealing to a fear of Jacobinism. No critic would describe the Two Addresses as a democratic statement. In his decision to support the Lowthers, Wordsworth worked to keep politi cal power in the hands of a single family, and worked to withhold political representation from his neighbors. The Two Addresses, like Cintra, valorizes the lower classes even while arguing for a limitation of their rights. Words worth expresses support for the suspension of habeas corpus and argues for the domination of the entire political process by the aristocracy because his belief in the character of nations as bound by tradition also extends to the classes. For the lower classes, Wordsworth argues that insularity with regard to the political process is a sign of great strength. This suture just happens to correspond to another, earlier belief, that an independent rural life within a closed economy is a superior moral existence, creating the illusion of a continuity. Mary Moorman, Wordsworth's most sympathetic biogra 18. In 1818, Henry Brougham, a Whig, ran for one of the parliamentary seats of West morland. One seat was held by Lord Lowther and the other by Colonel H. C. Lowther. Brougham's argument for unseating one of them was that it "was not in the best interests of the people for the Lowthers' political power in the region to be absolute. The writing of The Two Addresses to the Freeholders of Westmorland gained Wordsworth much favor from the Lowthers, and he was made Justice of the Peace in 1819. In many ways, Wordsworth's ac tions were a repetition of his father's efforts on behalf of the Lowthers in the election of 1768, which Kenneth Johnston describes as "a Pyrrhic victory that made the names of Low ther and Wordsworth hated for years to come."

Moorman traces the conservative turn (which doesn't, in Moorman's view, reach back to Cintra, even though the arguments of the three documents are nearly identical) to the desire to prevent social change and preserve the Lake District.20 But if we examine Wordsworth's political positions around the time of the Two Addresses, positions that were first fully articulated in Cintra, what emerges isn't local or idiosyncratic at all. What emerges is the rather conventional marriage between an aggressive policy abroad and a conservative, restrictive policy at home, nationalism marshaled for the sup posed preservation of individual freedom, individual freedom sacrificed for national security. On March 24, 1818, William sent Lord Lonsdale an ac count that Dorothy had written about Brougham's arrival in Kendal the day before. The ideological underpinning of what counted as local is clear. Dorothy describes Brougham: "I assure you he has nothing of a West moreland Countenance. I could have fancied him one of the French Dem agogues of the Tribunal of Terror at certain times, when he gathered a par ticular fierceness into his face. He is very like a Frenchman."21 The fear of Jacobinism is expressed again and again in William's letters to Lord Lonsdale regarding the election. Those who resist the political power of the "great Landholders," Wordsworth argues, are unable to "point out any arrangement by which Jacobinism can be frustrated, except by the ex istence of Large Estates continued from generation to generation in partic ular families, with parliamentary power in proportion" (21 Jan 1818: LW 413). "Proportion" is used here in the same way that Burke employs the term in his Reflections, tied to property and traditional rights. These, not in dividuals, are weighed in balance. In Cintra, this (conservative) societal bal ance is expressed as a sublime one. James Chandler singles out the follow ing passage as taken "wholesale" from Burke: The outermost and all-embracing circle of benevolence has inward concentric circles which, like those of the spider's web, are bound to gether by links, and rest upon each other; making one frame, and ca pable of one tremor; circles narrower and narrower, closer and closer, as they lie more to the centre of self from which they proceeded, and which sustains the whole.

Theresa Kelley, in Wordsworth's Revisionary Aesthetics, argues that an important aspect of Wordsworthian aesthetics is the opposition of the sublime and the beautiful: "As a quasi Burkean aesthetic of social norms and hierarchies, the Wordsworthian beautiful opposes the willful self-aggrandizement of the revolutionary or Satanic sublime, advocating instead com municability and a sense of known limits in art as well as society" (3). I propose that what Kelley reads as the beautiful is in fact the sublime. Following Kelley, I find "The Sublime and the Beautiful" to be an indispensable document in a discussion of Wordsworthian aesthetics, but I have resisted making the "beautiful" the central category as Kelley does, because of what the "The Sublime and the Beautiful" excludes. When Kant speaks of the beautiful in The Critique of Judgment, it is clear that he is talking about art and the human figure. This is so because they are less tied to a clear utilitarian purpose, the consideration of which tends to mislead. Burke's "beautiful" is less clearly defined, but the beautiful applies to objects that can be viewed in their entirety: smallness, fineness, and above all a pleasing line, are qualities</page><page sequence="10">58 BENJAMIN KIM power, the passage displays a dynamic that is traditionally sublime, but the passage is uniquely Wordsworthian in its level of anthropomorphism. Wordsworth is ostensibly speaking about faculties, but the language he uses invokes the discussion just prior, about the relations between classes. The higher feelings "condescend" and "adapt" to lower faculties described as "inmates," "companions," and "substitutes." The Burkean definition of national happiness as "the conspicuous crown" and "the ornament" links it to the upper classes. In Kant's Third Critique, the accord or discord between the faculties could be described as an intersubjective drama masquerading as an intrasubjective drama, but the level of anthropomorphism and the level of analogy here would be unthinkable in the Kantian system. The description of the "precipice" on which Napoleon stands as "hid eous" is striking in that no recoil to a higher faculty is allowed. If the sub lime is universal insofar as reactions to sensory experience are universal, Wordsworth limits this universality by creating a sublime with national limitations. Wordsworth exhorts the leaders to trust the Spanish people be cause "Manufactures and Commerce have there in far less degree than else where . . . destroyed their imaginations." Madrid is not Paris, so Spain's leaders have "nothing to dread from Jacobinism" (i: 332). The sentiment about the corrupting influence of cities is at the heart of Wordsworth's conservative nationalism. A healthy government is not defined as that which gives voice to the People, but as that which reflects a certain kind of ideal existence: rural, independent, traditional, and tied as much to place as to the nature of humankind. The pride and independent spirit of the Brit ish and the Spanish are distinguished from the "enfeebled" bodies and "inflamed passions" of the French. This chain of causalities, put forward as a prescription for the health of the individual and the body politic, gives of the beautiful. The absence of pronouncements on art in "The Sublime and the Beautiful" is striking, given Wordsworth's interest in the painterly tradition. The manuscript ends with, "As I have explained at large what I mean by the word sublimity, I might with propriety here proceed to treat of beauty, &amp; explain in what manner I conceive the mind to be affected when it has a sense of the beautiful" (2: 360). Why does this statement come after Words worth has described scene after scene as "beautiful"? It is my contention that Wordsworth intended to define the beautiful in line with a more traditional understanding, with an eye on pictorial representation or art generally. Wordsworth continues: I cannot pass from the sub lime without guarding the ingenuous reader against those caprices of vanity &amp; presumption derived from false teachers in the philosophy of the fine arts &amp; of taste, which Painters, connesieurs [sic], &amp; amateurs are perpetually interposing between the light of nature &amp; their own minds" (2: 360). Kelley ties "beauty" to "repose," but does "repose" leave the authority of the sublime if the sublime is the narrative describing the movement from awe and terror to repose? Wordsworth never isolates "repose" from its causal narrative, and his description does not leave the vocabulary of the sublime: "this sense of repose is the result of reason &amp; the moral law" (2: 355).</page><page sequence="11">WORDSWORTH'S RIVER DUDDON &amp; GUIDE TO LAKES 59 nationalism a leg-up on universal benevolence and justice, and describes the political orientation that Wordsworth would hold for most of his life: a conservatism that wished to conserve both a way of life and the center of political power. In Select Views (1810), Wordsworth traces a route along the Valley of Grisdale to Grasmere and describes some notable inhabitants: "I know not any where a more sublime combination of mountain forms . . . and as we climb almost immediately under the projecting masses of Helvellyn, the mind is overcome with a sensation, which in some would amount to per sonal fear, and cannot be but awful even to those who are most familiar with the images of duration, and power, and other kindred influences, by which mountainous countries controul or exalt the imaginations of men. It is not uninteresting to know, that in the last house but one of this Valley, separated, as it might seem, from all the ambition and troubles of this world, from its wars and commotions, was born the youth, who, in Spain, took prisoner of the Colonel of the Imperial Guard of Buonaparte" (2: 283). The national implications of the sublime in this passage are conveyed through context: the "youth," raised in the bosom of the mountains, was able to carry his freedom to foreign lands and defeat tyranny. In other pas sages, loco-description and national awareness converge without accident. The following passage, written for Select Views, was given the subheading "General Picture of Society" in the 1820 Guide: . . . venerable was the transition, when a curious traveller, descending from the heart of the mountains, had come to some ancient manorial residence in the more open parts of the Vales, which, through the rights attached to its proprietor, connected the almost visionary mountain republic he had been contemplating with the substantial frame of society as existing in the laws and constitution of a mighty empire. (2: 207) Somewhat detached from local description, this passage seems more at home in the 1820 version of the Guide than in Select Views, which tends to ward an often mundane description of suggested pathways. Nevertheless, there is a consistency between what passes as objective description and in terpretation, and the convergence between the two occurs in aesthetic judgment. Wordsworth describes the best way to approach lakes: As to the order in which objects are best seen?a lake being composed of water flowing from higher grounds, and expanding itself till its re ceptacle is filled to the brim,?it follows, that it will appear to most advantage when approached from its outlet ... for by way of this ap</page><page sequence="12">60 BENJAMIN KIM proach, the traveler faces the grander features of the scene, and is gen erally conducted into its most sublime recesses. (2: 229?30) Based on the surrounding discussion, the sublimity arises not only from the "grander features of the scene," but by the movement of water itself. This is clear from the attached note.23 The definition of sublimity here is philo sophical. The scene is one more example of a feature isolated many times throughout the Guide: water flowing into a larger receptacle. Abstracted, this sublimity also applies to the description of the traveler descending from the mountains into the manorial residences and thereby gaining an insight into the "substantial frame of society." In both passages, a descent is simul taneously an expansion (of understanding) and a contraction (into a re newed sense of place and self). The Wordsworthian sublime after 1808 leans on a putatively universal process to access national insight, which speaks volumes about how the Wordsworthian self is constituted in the later work. Perhaps the most extended example of the convergence of loco-description, national identity, and the sublime is The River Duddon, which also rehearses the "venerable" transition from the mountains, the seat of spiritual power, to the seat of political power. The River Duddon Although popular in Wordsworth's lifetime, The River Duddon has been neglected by modern readers. Only "After-thought" is regularly antholo gized; the other thirty-two sonnets have generated a surprisingly small amount of commentary. Undoubtedly part of the problem is the dominat ing image, that of the river. The stream, the river, and the rill have the abil ity to mirror human actions, but they also serve, rather mechanically, as connectors. On this last function, The River Duddon leans quite heavily. Despite the fact that the sequence is inaugurated by an identification be tween the river and the poet, the twists and turns of subject matter seem to lack a governing consciousness, and the sonnets seem to have only a vague thematic connection. Critics who have attempted to give an account of the middle sonnets have tended to follow the sequence as one would a river, with no explanation as to why the narrative stream moves here to this topic, and there to that topic. In Wordsworth and the Sonnet, Lee Johnson devotes most of the chapter on The River Duddon to "After-thought," and justifies this focus by pointing to the lack of connection between "After thought" and the rest of the sequence. Johnson claims that the "scenes of 23. "The only instances to which the foregoing observations do not apply, are Derwent water and Lowes-water. . . . Yet as far as respects the formation of such receptacles, the gen eral observation holds good: neither Derwent nor Lowes-water derive any supplies from the streams of those mountains that dignify the landscape towards the outlets" (2: 230).</page><page sequence="13">WORDSWORTH'S RIVER DUDDON &amp; GUIDE TO LAKES 61 sentimental and local historical interest [found in the middle sonnets] . . . merely provide a passive, though sometimes distracting, background,"24 and that "After-thought" proceeds "as if the preceding thirty-three sonnets were a house of cards to be brushed away" (125). Johnson is not claiming that the middle sonnets are without merit, but rather that "the themes of ["After-thought"] are not sufficiently developed" (133). To come to grips with why the middle sonnets have generated so little commentary, it is helpful to isolate the qualities of Wordsworth's poems to which readers generally respond. Johnson provides one when he claims that the "taste" for Wordsworth has been guided by a "preference for irony and conflict in unusual situations and states of mind" (120). Certainly, this desire finds more fulfillment at the end of the sequence than in the middle of it. The sonnets that were intended to be read as public statements, such as those collected in Poems Dedicated to National Independence and Liberty, have also received a fair amount of attention. The River Duddon stands uneasily be tween these two strains: as much as it is acknowledged that The River Duddon touches on historical themes, the sequence lacks immediacy be cause of the constant references to "immortality." And although the se quence is a narration of the Duddon poet's consciousness and the con sciousness ascribed to the river itself, the "irony and conflict" that usually find a home in such narrations do not come to fruition until the end. A look at the textual history of sonnet xxvi ("Return Content") reveals that the lack of "irony and conflict" was a conscious choice. A version of the poem was written as early as 1804, and was addressed to the Derwent, not the Duddon: Dear native Brook your ways I have pursu'd . . . Nor have I been your follower in vain, For not to speak of life and its first joys, Bound to your going by a tender chain Of flowers and delicate dreams that entertain Loose minds when men are growing out of Boys My manly heart has owed to your rough noise Triumph and thoughts no bondage can restrain. (note to sonnet xxvi, 3: 523) The "bondage" felt by the speaker is clearly tied to the process of boys turning into men. The defiant Derwent allows the speaker to compensate for this Fall by evoking early memories. This is a typical concern for the 24. Lee M. Johnson, Wordsworth and the Sonnet (Copenhagen: Rosenkilde and Bagger, 1973) 122.</page><page sequence="14">62 BENJAMIN KIM 1804 Wordsworth. Four years later, Wordsworth recycled the final line for a poem entitled, "Composed While the Author Was Engaged in Writing a Tract Occasioned by the Convention of Cintra," which found its way into the second set of Poems Dedicated to National Independence and Liberty (1815): Not 'mid the World's vain objects that enslave The free-born Soul?that World whose vaunted skill In selfish interest perverts the will Whose factions lead astray the wise and the brave? Not there, but in dark wood and rocky cave, And hollow vale which foaming torrents fill With omnipresent murmur as they rave Down their steep beds, that never shall be still: Here mighty Nature! in this school sublime I weigh the hopes and fears of suffering Spain; For her consult the auguries of time, And through the human heart explore my way; And look and listen?gathering, whence I may, Triumph, and thoughts no bondage can restrain. (1-14; my emphasis) This begins to approach the language of the later Duddon sonnets. "Bond age" has come to mean something different from 1804: it is clearly tied to the bondage of "suffering Spain" and the possible future bondage of Brit ain. The poem is unreadable without the occasion announced by its title. Water imagery is used defiantly in echoing both the assertion of national and personal independence, but despite the differences, the poem employs the familiar contrast between individual organic strength and the corrup tion of the "vain" world, a dynamic that was erased when the poem was again reworked as Duddon sonnet xxvi: return, Content! for fondly I pursued, Even when a child, the Streams?unheard, unseen; Through tangled woods, impending rocks between; Or, free as air, with flying inquest viewed The sullen reservoirs whence their bold brood? Pure as the morning, fretful, boisterous, keen, Green as the salt-sea billows, white and green? Poured down the hills, a choral multitude!

(1-14) When compared to the 1804 poem and the poem on the Convention of Cintra, sonnet xxvi, despite a more interesting rhythm, appears tepid. Son net xxvi narrates the speaker's return from the outlying areas of the Duddon to its banks, which in turn invokes a larger return to the Duddon of the speaker's youth. The narration of a "return" to one's native haunts is a drama that Wordsworth stages repeatedly, but what this particular poem lacks, in comparison to "Tintern Abbey" or The Prelude, is conflict. This "return" brings contentment. The change between the 1804 and 1820 ver sions is significant because the change dispenses with the conflict between youth and age: the Duddon "shieldfs]" the speaker not only from the vain world, but also from childhood "mischief." The use of "maturer" instead of "manly" to signify age emphasizes continuity between the stages of life. Florence Marsh notes the ubiquity of the river as symbol in Words worth's oeuvre: "It is a constant image, dominating The Prelude, sounding more faintly in The Excursion, focal in The River Duddon, providing a frame of reference for the Ecclesiastical Sonnets. "25 Marsh's study is comprehensive with regard to poetical works, but she does not deal with water imagery in the prose works. If the uses of the river as metaphor in Wordsworth's po etry are compared to examples from his prose, one finds the poetical exam ples to be less far-ranging, rather benign, and tied to the process of self reflection. This first example from Cintra prefigures the end of The River Duddon and is comparable to the examples gleaned from Wordsworth's poetry: ?so the domestic loves and sanctities which are in their nature less li able to be stained,?so these, whenever they have flowed with a pure and placid stream, do instantly, under the same influence, put forth their strength as a flood; and, without being sullied or polluted, pur sue?exultingly and with song?a course which leads the contempla tive reason to the ocean of eternal love. (1: 295) Befitting its context, this "placid" stream of "love" comes to take on a dif ferent character. Wordsworth writes, "A military spirit should be there [in Spain], and a military action, not confined like an ordinary river in one channel, but spreading like the Nile over the face of the land. . . . And, for 2$.

(150).27 If one approaches the water imagery in The River Duddon without refer ence to the prose works, the reflections appear flat because they are used to stress continuity instead of discontinuity and alienation. The poem "To the Rev. Dr. Wordsworth," addressed to Christopher Wordsworth, was cate gorized as a miscellaneous poem in 1820 and moved to the beginning of the Duddon sequence in subsequent editions to serve as an introduction. William exhorts Christopher to think of his native land even "while the imperial City's din / Beats frequent on your satiate ear" (73-74). Yet, the doubling of William from an earlier time only goes so far, because the dele terious effects of the city are not stressed. Instead, William " revere[s] the choice" that took Christopher from his "native hills" (20) because the choice benefits the nation. Christopher, bringing homespun values to his position of influence, functions as a link between the "proud margin of the Thames" and the Duddon. William exclaims: "Hail, ancient manners! Sure defence, / Where they survive, of wholesome laws" (55?56). Composed during Christmas tide, "To the Rev. Dr. Wordsworth" adds a Christian counterpoint to the pagan scenes found in the middle of the sequence. The articulation of Britain as a Christian nation (developed in the 1822 Ecclesias 26. The use of flowing water in Cintra extends to more than just a source of imagery. Wordsworth uses flowing water to govern his own rhetoric: "In following the stream of these thoughts, I have not wandered from my course" (i: 292). 27. The paper that published the first of the Two Addresses, The Westmorland Advertiser and Kendal Chronicle, ultimately, for various reasons, came to support Brougham. The House of Lowther put its resources behind a new paper, The Westmorland Gazette and Kendal Advertiser. De Quincey was later hired as its second editor. A comment on the competing paper by the editor of The Kendal Chronicle satirizes The Two Addresses: This organ of political intelligence will without doubt prove very fruitful in maxims similar to the doctrines which were lately offered to the public by a gentleman, who derides the poverty of humble Westmorland; who considers the little old body to be very silly, and thinks her affairs, like those of any other idiot, are best in the hands of a respectable guardian, who knows the heights and levels of streams of venality which flow from the puddle of corruption, and felt the force of them too, if we are not mis taken, (qtd. in Wells 1082)</page><page sequence="17">WORDSWORTH'S RIVER DUDDON &amp; GUIDE TO LAKES 65 tical Sonnets) depends not only on Christopher, but on the Rev. Robert Walker, a Lake District clergyman who lived as the lower classes lived, and became the subject of local legend. Walker's biography is given in the notes to The River Duddon. Christopher and Walker are both held up as defenders of the same establishment, and together, they create a balance be tween the high and the low servants of the church, meant to mirror a bal ance between segments of the larger society, between the rich and the poor. The investment in continuity and the softened stance on the "Impe rial city" are meant to define Britain as a nation. The River Duddon defines the nation on a conceptual level as well, and the puzzling sonnet, "Ameri can Tradition" makes more sense when seen through this goal. Britain's mistake, according to Wordsworth, was in its insensibility to the dictates of national sovereignty. Wordsworth feels sympathy for America not because of its status as a former colony, but because of its dependence on its own "native" tradition, bound to place. The speaker claims that America's "ru ins" (unlike the Druidic structures of Britain) have living interpreters in the Indians. Another flight of fancy at the end of the Duddon sequence, from the mouth of the Duddon to the Thames, echoes the path of Christopher Wordsworth, and also serves to link the heart of Britain (the Lake District) to the seat of power. Simply tracing the Duddon's peaceful journey to the Irish Sea would not have sufficed to define Britain as a commercial and military power. Here is Duddon sonnet xxxn in its entirety: Not hurled precipitous from steep to steep; Lingering no more 'mid flower-enamelled lands And blooming thickets; nor by rocky bands Held; but in radiant progress toward the Deep Where mightiest rivers into powerless sleep Sink, and forget their nature?now expands Majestic Duddon, over smooth flat sands Gliding in silence with unfettered sweep! Beneath an ampler sky a region wide Is opened round him:?hamlets, towers, and towns, In stately mien to sovereign Thames allied Spreading his bosom under Kentish downs, With commerce freighted, or triumphant war. (I-I3) One of the best works on this poem is still Paul de Man's pre deconstructive effort, "Time and History in Wordsworth." De Man high lights the conflicting aims established by the opening of the sequence. The first sonnet creates an identification between the poet, his verse, and the river: "Better to breathe at large on this clear height / Than toil in needless</page><page sequence="18">66 BENJAMIN KIM sleep from dream to dream: / Pure flow the verse, pure, vigorous, free, and bright, / For Duddon, long-lived Duddon, is my theme!" (11-14). The identification gives the river a consciousness, begins the theme of wak ing/sleeping, and promises an end that is both a fulfillment and a loss of in dividuality and consciousness: the "progress" is "toward the Deep / Where mightiest rivers into powerless sleep / Sink, and forget their nature." De Man points to the "now" as an effort to linger in the moment of fulfillment and to shut out the inevitable loss of consciousness, and defines the last three lines, with their images of "human historical enterprises," as a mo mentary stop of bad faith en route to the real insight, "the assertion of his torical achievement," history being defined as "the retrospective recording of man's failure to overcome the power of time. "28 The downplaying of these images was not without precedent. In a note to the sonnet, De Selincourt writes, "It is interesting to note that originally the octave of xxxii and the sestet of xxxm formed one sonnet, the comparison to the Thames, with its far-fetched allusion to "triumphant war" and "cannon" being a not entirely appropriate afterthought" (3: 524). De Selincourt pos tulates the change as an effort to shield the all-important end of the se quence from the images of war and commerce. But in light of Words worth's thinking around the time, could we really deem the allusion inappropriate? It is my contention that the "human historical enterprises," commerce and war, are precisely what Wordsworth wants to include. Because Words worth chose to move from the Duddon to the Thames at this critical junc ture, one cannot brush aside the fact that the rivers are "allied," and read the beginning of the next sonnet, "But here [at the Duddon] no cannon thunders to the gale" (1), as a simple assertion of difference.29 Indeed, doesn't "To the Rev. Dr. Wordsworth" indicate that Wordsworth is stress ing a link between the two rivers? 28. Paul de Man, "Time and History in Wordsworth," Romanticism and Contemporary Crit icism: The Gauss Seminar and Other Papers, ed. Kevin Newmark (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1993) 9i 29. This reading has proved to be the rule. Melinda Pondor writes, "Comparing the Duddon's 'stately mien' to 'sovereign Thames,' the poet evokes the Thames portrayed by Pope in 'Windsor Forest.' Unlike Pope's martial setting, however, Wordsworth's Duddon is lowly and peaceful" ("Echoing Poetry with History: Wordsworth's Duddon Sonnets and Their Notes," Genre 21 [1988]: 169-70). Daniel Robinson tersely explains the complex situ ation: "As [Charlotte] Smith frequently does, Wordsworth compares his native river to the mighty Thames; but he notes their shared mortality in losing their selves in the ocean. He re marks, furthermore, that the Duddon is unencumbered by commerce or war in its progress" (461). Lee Johnson's explanation is even more terse: "In sonnet xxxin, the modest ships on the Duddon are contrasted with the 'cannon' and 'haughty pendants' carried on the Thames" (171).</page><page sequence="19">WORDSWORTH'S RIVER DUDDON &amp; GUIDE TO LAKES 67 The neglect of worldly implications furthers another misreading of the sonnet sequence, that the movement of the end is toward transcendence. Geoffrey Hartman reads "After-thought" as a deferral to the eternal power of nature: "nature outlives man and will continue to inspire him" (336). John Wyatt writes that the "sonnet 'Conclusion' transcends earthly associa tions. . . . The real Duddon may be 'allied to sovereign Thames, but it leads to a vaster mingling beyond space and time?with Eternity."30 Melinda Pondor labels the compensation as the imagination, and argues that what makes "man" immortal is "his imagination and creative faculties as well as his religious faith" (172). The agreement about the transcendent qualities of the final sonnets has led, however, to a point of disagreement about where the climax of the se quence occurs. Pondor follows Hartman in her focus on "After-thought," while Wyatt disagrees, and argues that "the final note of the sonnet se quence is to be found, not in "After-thought," but in Sonnets xxn and xxxm" (42). Daniel Robinson writes that "the immortal poet may follow the stream into death," but then adds a lengthy explanation that hardly re lieves the confusion or explains the paradox: "Suggesting that the poet's ambition transcends the failings of the mortal wanderer, Wordsworth sets up the brilliant correction of the sonnet he would later call "After thought," which follows "Conclusion" and ends the series. The mortal wanderer cannot follow the river into the sea and must turn to retrace the journey to its start. In so doing, Wordsworth sees the river still extends from its source?it is immortal" (461). Robinson's "immortal poet" dies, and the "mortal wanderer" seems to have the power of survival; after all, if the sequence culminates in the Duddon flowing into the sea, then "After thought" is a voice from the grave. Why is the ending so difficult to read? The answer lies in Wordsworth's choice to allude to the Thames at such a pivotal moment. The narrative of consciousness has become adulterated with the dictates of defining a na tional consciousness; while the former demands an "end," the latter de mands to stay in the world. Indeed, a much neater ending was sacrificed for the inclusion of the image of commerce and war.31 If one chooses to ignore 30.

Here is a reconstruction of Sonnet xxxn before the change: Not hurled precipitous from steep to steep; Lingering no more 'mid flower-enamelled lands And blooming thickets; nor by rocky bands Held; but in radiant progress toward the Deep Where mightiest rivers into powerless sleep Sink, and forget their nature?now expands</page><page sequence="20">68 BENJAMIN KIM these images, then "After-thought" becomes a mere repetition of the reli gious sentiments found in "Conclusion" (hence the confusion about where the exact "end" lies). But a careful consideration of the language used in "After-thought" reveals that there is an intended articulation between the poem and a worldly compensation. Here is the final sonnet, "After thought," in full: / thought of Thee, my partner and my guide, As being past away.? Vain sympathies! For backward, Duddon! as I cast my eyes, I see what was, what is, and will abide; Still glides the Stream, and shall for ever glide; The Form remains, the Function never dies; While we, the brave, the mighty, and the wise, We Men, who in our morn of youth defied The elements, must vanish;?be it so! Enough, if something from our hands have power To live, and act, and serve the future hour; And if, as toward the silent tomb we go, Through love, through hope, and faith's transcendent dower, We feel that we are greater than we know. (1-14) Lee Johnson calls this poem "as sophisticated a sonnet as Wordsworth ever wrote" (125), and reads the investment in "something from our hands" as expressive of Wordsworth's hope "that his own poems would endure" (127). That the material implication of "something" is tied to poetry or in scription is a reading that is generally accepted.32 But the poem is directed at the larger community of "the brave, the mighty, and the wise," not at the smaller community of poets. The phrase, "the brave, the mighty, and the wise," comes from Moschus' "Lament for Bion," a work that Words worth translated in his youth.33 Variants of the line are used repeatedly in Majestic Duddon, over smooth flat sands Gliding in silence with unfettered sweep! And may thy Poet, cloud-born Stream! be free? The sweets of earth contentedly resigned, And each tumultuous working left behind At seemly distance?to advance like Thee; Prepared, in peace of heart, in calm of mind And soul, to mingle with Eternity! 32.

And the 1806 poem, "Composed While the Author Was Engaged in Writing a Tract Occasioned by the Convention of Cintra," contains the lines, "The free-born Soul?that World whose vaunted skill / In selfish interest perverts the will / Whose factions lead astray the wise and the brave." The structure of loss and compensation is familiar, but what is offered here marks an important departure from earlier work. The compensation offered by "After-thought" has been read as material (poetry) and spiritual (knowledge of immortality). But if one extends the narrative beyond "Af ter-thought, " the ignored images of commerce and war appear significant, because they follow immediately after the description of the "Deep" as the place "Where mightiest rivers into powerless sleep / Sink" (my emphasis). The next instance of the word "power" comes in "After-thought": "Enough, if something from our hands have power / To live, and act, and serve the future hour." The compensation is institutional, and "After-thought" is not a repudiation of material compensation, as de Man believed, but is instead an affirmation of "human historical enterprises." It is interesting to note that in "Time and History in Wordsworth," de Man acknowledges his debt to Geoffrey Hartman by praising Wordsworth's Poetry as marking a positive turning-point in criticism: "The Arnoldian tra dition of reading Wordsworth as a moralist has, for quite a while now, been superseded by a concern for the implicit poetics that are present in his writing and that have to be understood prior to the interpretation of a moral statement that seems conventional" (75). W.J. B. Owen34 And James K. Chandler have documented the central role of "power" in Words worth's poetry. Chandler has cited Arnold's interpretation of Wordsworth as highlighting the conservative elements of Wordsworthian ideology. Al though The River Duddon is outside of Wordsworth's "major period," which is the focus of Chandler's Wordsworth's Second Nature, Arnold's read ing applies. In his introduction to Wordsworth, Arnold writes, "... to say that the English poets are remarkable for dealing with it [life], is only an other way of saying what is true, that in poetry the English genius has espe cially shown its power. Wordsworth deals with it, and his greatness lies in 34- Although Owen ties Wordsworth's use of "power" to its traditional role in the sub lime, he recognizes that Wordsworth greatly expands or diffuses its role. When Wordsworth enters London in The Prelude, he is "gripped by the power of the place: the place itself, its long history (the concept of duration is relevant); its size, its political power, its moral power (for good or evil), its cultural power ..." (W. J. B. Owen, Wordsworth as Critic [Toronto: U of Toronto P, 1969] 214).</page><page sequence="22">70 BENJAMIN KIM dealing with it powerfully. . . . He is one of the chief glories of English po etry, and by nothing is England so glorious as by her poetry" (47-5 5).35 Wordsworth is exhorted for providing a moral philosophy that is humble and virtuous, dealing largely with self-governance. Arnold presents Words worth as a balm for the age because of his intense concern for the individ ual, but the acknowledgment of this concern is used to move to a larger statement about the nation. Indeed, within a short space, Arnold moves from one to the other through the theme of "power." The end of The River Duddon shows that power has an additional inflection not addressed by Owen or Chandler: State power. The end of the sequence reads as a scene of sublime instruction as defined in "The Sublime and the Beautiful," with its three component parts, individuality, duration, and power. It would be a mistake to limit these parts to categories of perception because Wordsworth admits no such boundaries. The slippage between the outside and the inside is latent in the sublime tradition; for example, Wordsworth uses the phrase, "individual form or forms" as a reference to objects, but the object in this case, the river, is like the Kantian mountain in that as it presents itself to the viewer, its magnitude prevents complete delimitation.36 That is, the status of the sublime mountain or river as an object is uncertain, and this uncertainty is reflected in the individual perceiver, whose own individuality is threat ened, caught between "resistance" and "participation" in a greater power. A unique quality of the sublime scene presented at the end of the Duddon sequence, however, is the overt mirroring of consciousness between viewer and river: nature is troped in human terms. In the Kantian sublime, once the conditions are met for a sublime process, the narrative turns in ward. For Wordsworth, there is no such division: when one watches the individual river flowing into the sea, one is already watching the internal drama. Wordsworth's sublime is thus not only dependent on a relatively restricted set of conditions, but on an ideological or poetic pre-condition ing. According to "The Sublime and the Beautiful," sublimity is not a quality of objects alone, as it "cannot be received from an object however eminently qualified to impart them, without a prepatory [sic] intercourse with that object or with others of the same kind" (2: 359). This qualifica tion perhaps explains why the exact moment of death, or the moment of the inward turn, is so difficult to discern in the closing three sonnets and why subjectivities proliferate at the end; Wordsworth's sublime, unlike 35- Matthew Arnold, Preface to The Poems of Wordsworth in The Complete Prose Works of Matthew Arnold, ed. R. H. Super, n vols. (Ann Arbor: U of Michigan P, 1973) 9: 1960-77. 36. Here is Wordsworth's version: "... if they [mountains] be looked at from a point which has brought us so near but that the whole of it is visible, we shall be impressed with a sensation of sublimity" (2: 351).</page><page sequence="23">WORDSWORTH'S RIVER DUDDON &amp; GUIDE TO LAKES 71 many others, can stand a permanent state of viewing because it is not de pendent on leaving the outside world behind. The Guide to the Lakes The sublime scene of The River Duddon has a counterpart in The Guide to the Lakes. Wordsworth argues for the superiority of England's smaller lakes over the larger "American and Asiatic lakes." The smaller size of England's lakes is preferable because the viewer is almost able to see the entire lake, with the water flowing out of the frame. This is another version of the sub lime conditions outlined in "The Sublime and the Beautiful" and demon strated by the scene at the mouth of the Thames. By following the move ment of the water into a larger body with a movement of the mind, one inaugurates the chain of deferral that is at the heart of finding one's place in the world and in the nation. It must be noted that on a surface level, the framed view could be described as picturesque. The flow of water in par ticular accords with the kind of flow demonstrated by the scene of Lower Rydal Falls that Alan Liu, in Wordsworth: The Sense of History, analyzes as the prototypically picturesque scene.37 But despite the picturesque orienta tion of The Guide on the level of taste, the main philosophical structures governing The Guide are still those of the sublime because the aesthetic su periority of the English lake is presented as a moral superiority. The water flows out of the frame, suggesting a larger body of water, a greater power. Those who prefer larger lakes, Wordsworth suggests, have been "seduced" into mistaking "grandeur, as connected with magnitude." With the larger "American and Asiatic lakes," the viewer has "the blankness of a sea prospect without the grandeur and the accompanying sense of power" (2: 180). By dissociating power from magnitude and tying it to grandeur, Wordsworth defines "power" not as a natural force, but as something that must be interpreted, embodied. Power is felt by analogically dramatizing the individual's relation to a larger body by "resistance" and "participa tion. " The slippage that occurs with "individuality" and "power" occurs with "duration" as well. About the sublime object, Wordsworth writes: "... the only way such an object can affect us, contemplated under the notion of duration, is when the faint sense which we have of its individuality is lost in the general sense of duration belonging to the Earth itself. Prominent indi vidual form must, therefore, be conjoined with duration, in order that Ob jects of this kind may impress a sense of sublimity" (2: 351). Like Uvedale Price, Wordsworth believed that natural scenes were enhanced by struc tures built by the lower classes. The lesson that Wordsworth draws from 37- Alan Liu, Wordsworth: The Sense of History (Stanford: Stanford UP, 1989) 81.</page><page sequence="24">72 BENJAMIN KIM the appreciation of such structures deals with duration. Decaying structures that blend with the landscape are not rude, but follow the "principles of the most thoughtful architecture." Even as the age of the structure signals duration, the age of the house is nothing compared to the rocks on which it sits, and it is precisely the reminder of this truth that makes decrepit buildings so morally instructive. Questions regarding one's own place in time, one's own duration, are answered by a deferral to a larger, more en during process. "Duration" is related to the history of the nation and the continuation of patriarchy: As these houses have been, from father to son, inhabited by persons engaged in the same occupations, yet necessarily with changes to their circumstances, they have received without incongruity additions and accommodations adapted to the needs of each successive occupant, who, for the most part proprietor, was at liberty to follow his own fancy; so that these humble dwellings remind the contemplative spec tator of a production of nature, and may (using a strong expression) rather to be said to have grown than to have been erected;?to have risen, by an instinct of their own, out of native rock?so little is there in them of formality, such is their wildness and beauty. (2: 105) This interpretation extends to manor houses as well. Old houses enhance the landscape, while the white houses of the nouveau riche are abomina tions. Even more interesting with regard to the upper classes is this descrip tion found in the Two Addresses; the houses of the small proprietors, which look as if they had grown from rock, find their counterparts in the large es tates, since the large landed families serve as the "sedentary" bedrock of the Constitution: As far as it concerns the general well-being of the Kingdom, it would be very easy to show, that if the democratic activities of the great Towns and of the manufacturing Districts, were not counteracted by the sedentary power of large estates, continued from generation to generation in particular families, it would be scarcely possible that the Laws and Constitution of the Country could sustain the shocks which they would be subject to. (2: 160) Wordsworth comes close to describing scenes on the basis of formal ar rangement alone in the third section, entitled, "Changes, and Rules of Taste for Preventing their Bad Effects," but his justification for choosing a certain "taste" is profoundly based on an idea of living correctly within so ciety. The main objects of Wordsworth's scorn are those estate owners who feel the need to stand out from their surroundings. According to</page><page sequence="25">WORDSWORTH'S RIVER DUDDON &amp; GUIDE TO LAKES 73 Wordsworth, there is no greater insult to the surrounding landscape than a white house: All gross transgressions of this kind originate, doubtless, in a feeling natural and honourable to the human mind, viz, the pleasure which it receives from distinct ideas, and from the perception of order, regular ity, and contrivance. Now, unpractised minds receive these impres sions only from objects that are divided from each other by strong lines of demarcation; hence the delight with which such minds are smitten by formality and harsh contrast. But I would beg of those ea ger to create the means of such gratification, first carefully to study what already exists; and they will find, in country so lavishly gifted by nature, an abundant variety of forms marked out with a precision that will satisfy their desires. Moreover, a new habit of pleasure will be formed opposite to this, arising out of the perception of the fine gra dations by which in nature one thing passes away into another, and the boundaries that constitute individuality disappear in one instance only to be revived elsewhere under a more alluring form." (2: 210) If the picturesque is "the beautiful" applied to the landscape, then this dis cussion seems to move within this category. But the diction is misleading. Wordsworth speaks here of "individuality," proper to a discussion of what is putatively "the beautiful." But "individuality" functions to personify ob jects in the landscape, as evidenced by the relationship between proper buildings and proper trees, the very next topic. New and lavish buildings that call attention to themselves are reflective of an egotism, the vain and futile desire to dominate the landscape. Only older, decrepit buildings have the sufficient gravity to form a main component of the landscape. Words worth then moves to a discussion about planting, and he considers the "large tracts of larch-plantations" a scandal. He contrasts the process of larch planting with the operations of nature: trees "perish, or produce, ac cording as the soil and situation upon which they fall are suited to them . . . and the tree grows, sometimes single, taking its own shape without con straint, but for the most part compelled to conform itself to some law im posed upon by its neighbors" (2: 220). Wordsworth rarely abandons the analogy between human society and natural processes. Even in the section of the Guide where one would expect to find "the beautiful," Wordsworth justifies his most important pronouncements by appealing to an ideal soci ety. Irregularity, valued by many picturesque theorists for its own sake, is connected by Wordsworth to "the liberty that encourages, and the law that limits," a sublime description, to be sure. For Kant, the law of liberty, found in Reason, serves to theorize society</page><page sequence="26">74 BENJAMIN KIM as an ideal, as the link between individual universalism and human free dom. But for Wordsworth, law and liberty are found externally, as a kind of "training": left to themselves without the "law imposed upon by its neighbors," trees cannot contribute to an aesthetically pleasing landscape. As for trees, so for water: "Still water under the influence of no current" reflects the "clouds, the light, and all the imagery of the sky and the sur rounding hills" (2: 179). This mode of reflection is supplemented by an other kind of reflection independent of sensory perception. The descrip tion of the relationship between waters, like the one between trees, is borrowed from human society. Solitary pools, like persons, are lonely: "A not unpleasing sadness is induced by this perplexity [of a disconnected pool], and these images of decay; while the prospect of a body of pure wa ter unattended with groves and other cheerful rural images by which fresh water is usually accompanied, and unable to give furtherance to the meager vegetation around it?excites some repulsive power strongly put forth, and thus deepens the melancholy natural to such scenes" (2: 187). For Words worth, statements that seem to be about subjective operations always re main ambiguous in their application, and the "component parts," of the sublime exist fully-formed, prior to any "sensation." The formulation found in "The Sublime and the Beautiful" (individuality, duration, power) can thus be read as: a formal description of a picturesque landscape; a gen eral theory of the dynamic between an individual and society; a general theory about the ideal relations between classes; a general theory about the dynamics of groups within the state. Both The River Duddon and The Guide to the Lakes were formed by the conservative awakening in response to the Peninsular War. I have argued that, with the exception of an ever-increasing religiosity, Wordsworth's political ideas remained consistent through the next decade, and the 1820 volume reflects this consistency. Wordsworth's justifications for his political activity during 1808 and 1818 rested on the same idealized view of the na tion. One can only guess to what extent Wordsworth believed that the cry in 1818 for political representation was the beginning of a "Jacobinism" that would lead to chaos. The sentiment is repeated often enough in the letters to Lord Lonsdale preceding the parliamentary election. According to Wallace Douglas, Wordsworth and Southey bought freehold land and dis tributed it amongst acquaintances (449). For both, the laws and the Consti tution of Britain weren't contained in process, but in recognizable (aristo cratic) faces of power. Even the idea that the great landed families deserved their power because of ancient claims turns out to demand qualifications: the House of Lowther had long roots in the area, but its status as the main power in the region was established in the election of 1768, which started a</page><page sequence="27">WORDSWORTH'S RIVER DUDDON &amp; GUIDE TO LAKES 75 string of political victories achieved through bribery and strong-arming. Wordsworth's conservatism ran deeper than a mere impulse for the status quo. His subversion of the existing process indicated no desire to limit aris tocratic privilege. An honest view of Wordsworth's politics, however, should not preclude critical appreciation. When placed against Words worth's conservative vision, works such as The River Duddon and The Guide to the Lakes not only take on a new relevance, but a consistency pre viously denied.
