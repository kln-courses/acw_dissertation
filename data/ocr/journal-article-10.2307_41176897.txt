<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Necessity of Faith Joseph Sittler tried my best so to read the printed subject that was sent to me, "The Necessity of Faith," to make it read, "The Necessity for Faith." If it could have been made to read that way I would have been offered an homilectical opportunity to which I would have risen like a Minnesota pickerel ! But no matter how hard I looked at it, there is was - "The Necessity of Faith," and I felt it there- fore rather obligatory that I do what I was asked to do and talk on the subject as stated. And the harder I looked at it the more I saw that a first task must be to an- alyze the proposition. Such an analysis ought to provide the occasion to make certain other propositions with which I am certain, following the luncheon today with my colleagues, we will have a happy time. The second introductory statement I must make is that I think it is sporting that a man should announce his assumptions - concede that he does not carry within himself the entire corpus of the Christian tradition and admit that within this mighty home he lives within a particular house. And, therefore, I have assumed as follows : These are called "Christian Conversations," and I am not talking about religion or of religiousness in general, or about faith in general; I want to talk about faith as it is understood within the Christian tradition. Second, I stand within the Reformed tradition, and within that Reformed tradition, a Lutheran. I have announced this not because I am either boasting or ashamed of it, but because it es- tablishes the clear position from which I speak. I It is necessary to analyze the topic that has been chosen so as to define what is the purpose of this hour. These afternoons are supposed to be in the nature of conversations. The sine qua non of a useful and fructifying conversation is that all parties to it have a consensus about primary terms. The three terms that are used in this phrase are all capable of various interpretations, and if we place these alternatives clearly before us and then state in precisely what sense each one is understood in the paper that opens the discussion there will follow, we hope, not perhaps agreement, but useful because clarifying conversation. Therefore, I begin with certain observations about the word, faith, in order to excise the particularity of Christian faith and define what it means as over and against other legitimate but not at this moment proper uses of the word in the context of this conversation. By the word, faith, we commonly mean religious faith ; and by religious faith in general we usually mean an acknowledgment of and some Dr. Joseph Sittler is well known as a college and university Chapel preacher. He is Professor of Systematic Theology at the Chicago Lutheran Theological Seminary in Maywood, Illinois. Educated at Wittenberg College, Hamma Divinity School, Oberlin, and the University of Heidelberg, Dr. Sittler is author of The Doctrine of the Word, and a member of the American section of Faith and Order. The paper presented here was given at the beginning of a series of "Christian Conversations" which took place at Hamline University, St. Paul, Minnesota, during 1954-55. [198]</page><page sequence="2">The Necessity of Faith degree of effective relationship to a super-individual reality. If one sustains within his life this relationship, then he believes himself to maintain a relationship of faith. That to which one is so related need not be a holy someone or a holy purpose. This thing to which one relates himself in faith may be but an aspect of individual or community consciousness, for instance, sensitivity, or sympathy, or any constant which he believes good and which he finds pervasive in the history of human be- havior, like openness to a community. What one calls faith in a general religious sense may be but confidence in the sheer value of human aspiration - aspiration toward moral achievement which is beyond any which at the moment has been arrived at. If some of you have been reading the series of syndicated articles, "This I Believe", you will have observed that the words faith and belief are so widely used that one gets the impression that if this tent of the word faith covers all the various things in which people say they believe, then obviously the word faith has lost all precision. That may even be called faith in God which by analysis turns out to have a non-Christian content. God, that is, may be a name given to what Santayana call- ed "animal faith" - a vital consciousness of a continuity and a dependability which is based upon no other ground than the observations of the regularities and creat- ivities of all-sustaining nature. What Santayana calls "animal faith", and for the object of which he sometimes uses the word "God", may be completely devoid of everything that the Christian tradition has meant by faith. Or there is another option : one uses the term "philosophical faith." This is commonly used to indicate that service to the religious impulse which is done by certain philosophical surmises. That is, when a theologian or a person with a reli- gious bent uses the term, "philosophical faith", they indicate that aspect of the phi- losophical enterprise which seems to second the motion of the religious impulse or to give some support to religious surmises. This philosophical faith is generally of an idealistic kind. If, for instance, one is persuaded that idealism gives a satisfying explanation of the nature of things so that goodness, and beauty, and truth, etc., are realities in which men to a greater or lesser degree participate, this assumption may do service for what in another person may only be adequately supplied by a thorough-going religious faith. It may fill the space created by man's desire for ade- quate and coherent world-order. II Now the second word in the title. I wish to point out several ways in which the word, necessity, can be used. It is my conviction, as I hope to elaborate in a moment, that the term cannot be used at all about faith ! Therefore, we have got to make clear, by saying what are the ways in which the word can properly be used, the assertion that in this context it ought not be used at all. Necessity is a term in logic, first of all. When so used, it indicates that an established proposition must, of logical necessity, be followed by another proposition and that the validity of the second is bestowed by the unassailable soundness of the first. Second, the word, [199]</page><page sequence="3">The Christian Scholar necessity, may be used in moral analysis. For instance, when Shakespeare says (and he put this significantly upon the lips of one of the fattest balloons that he ever created), "To thine own self be true, and it must follow as the night the day, thou canst not be false to any man :" - that is a highly dubious proposition on the em- pirical face of it. But it is within a context in which the word, necessity, has received a popular and accepted meaning. When used in this context the word means to in- dicate that there are certain values, regularities, sequences, in the mortal moral order. And confidence in this regularity and dependability can be the object of faith, as- sumed to be derived of necessity from the structure and operation of moral forces. ". . . it must follow as the night the day, thou canst not be false to any man." That is the legitimate and proper use of the word, necessity; but such a use is illegitimate when used about Christian faith. There is a third use of the word that I want to deal with here in order that we may recognize its illegitimate character in this company, and eliminate it. The word faith is sometimes simply a powerful way to give expression to a need. Such is simply a tactical use of the word. That is, faith can be used tactically in order to give a powerful expression to a sense of need so that others will be called to support a certain situation or to advance toward a certain goal. Let me illustrate. We ought to attend to this use of the word in this sense very closely, because it is presently being used in that way by devotees of various idolatries which run all the way from patriotism to forms of material production and distribution. Persons use the word as a powerful term to win converts. An analysis, for instance, of what underlies the point of view of the journal, Christian Economics, which calls for the necessity of faith, reveals that the real God is a form of organization of so- ciety, - and what they want faith for is to support that organization. Religious faith which identifies the historical purposes of God and this form of organization is de- clared necessary. It is not a logical necessity ; it is obviously not a moral necessity. For other forms are thinkable and have actually existed. But the use of the term in this instance is a tactical device. None of these uses of the word, faith, is precise and none of these elaborations of necessity is true to the meaning of the term. For the following reasons : Faith, as I have spoken of it, is but a term loosely used to indicate an activity or a con- fidence or a relationship, which ought more accurately to be described in other ways. What is indicated by the term as we have now used it is rather (a) an assumption of a value priority, (b) a judgment as to the regularity of an aspect of actuality which gives us confidence towards the future, or (c) a calculated confidence which plays the same role in practical life as a Dun and Bradstreet rating plays in mer- chandising life. For instance, I heard a Senator (il do believe it was a Senator from Minnesota!) not so long ago, talking about religious faith. As an analogy for faith^ he talked about the world of credit. He was appealing, in a lay sermon, for faith in God. Credit is faith! The whole business world understands it, and all use it in the merchandising field. We all operate with faith! [200]</page><page sequence="4">The Necessity of Faith Now this in an extremely perilous kind of talk. The extension of credit is a calculated risk. It ought not to be called an act of faith. The stores know jolly well which people pay their bills ! A certain company from which I bought something not long ago said that I could charge up to $100 worth, but not $200; they know me better than I know myself ! This extension of observed regularities of behavior into prognostications about the future is a calculated risk and it ought not to be called faith. The same understanding of the word necessity shows that the term is not intelligible if used as a modifier of faith. Even the misuse of the term faith, as we have considered such misuse, ought not to be connected with the proper use of the word, necessity. And a properly concise use of the term, as I hope to show in a moment, would require a term not only of a different, but a completely opposite, order. Ill The constructive part of my task I hope to accomplish by an elaboration of four propositions. First: The affirmations of faith are faith's affirmations about God. They are, therefore, radically different from all rational metaphysics and can- not be derived from or immediately connected with metaphysical propositions. Now all I am saying is that affirmations of faith are affirmations of faith ! This sounds tautological and, hence, unnecessary ! But the history of Christian and other areas in Western thought reveal that again and again this has been ignored. What this pro- position seeks to insure is that we keep a clear and clean distinction between the affirmations of metaphysics, which have a legitimacy and a methodology of their own, and the affirmations of faith. Since Christian faith is faith in God who has revealed Himself in Christ, faith has something very definite to say about God. This definiteness, however, and its content, have their foundation in God's disclosure of Himself and nowhere else. They do not rest upon rational demonstration or theo- retical or logical argumentation. I am not saying that these affirmations when known and certainly held do not have an influence upon and profound intellectual connec- tions with all areas of inquiry. But they are not conclusions drawn from what can be demonstrated about the world or history or humanity. Faith does not become cer- tain upon the basis of logical proof. From the point of view of man's activity, faith has the character of decision. Its quality is that of audacity or daring. This must be said as over and against rationalism, particularly the rationalism of the last phase of the Enlightenment which is still so powerfully at work among us. The affirmations of faith were simply identified with rational metaphysics. At the same time both theologians and metaphysicians spoke of pure articles and mixed articles. And among these mixed articles of theology (that is, articles that were mixed in that they were derived partly from reason and partly from revelation) were the propositions about God. Thus, metaphysics found a place in the very center of the conception of faith. The result was that faith was confused with supposed the- oretical knowledge and the nature of the Christian conception of God was ser- [201]</page><page sequence="5">The Christian Scholar iously obscured. It is the purpose of theology, as I understand it, to understand faith in its particularity ; not to prove or establish it, but to understand its nature and claim. Hence, theology contributes both to the categories of philosophical and theological thought when it acknowledges the different character of the affirmations of faith and the affirmations of metaphysics. The second: The affirmations of faith are, without exception, of a symbolic character. Since God is the whole content of Christian faith, and since the expres- sions which must be used in faith's affirmations about God belong to this world, the affirmations necessarily are of a figurative and symbolic character. God is to faith the Eternal who cannot be contained in the limits of time and space. But, our categories do belong within the limits of time and space and they are intelligible only when the limits are recognized and observed. If theology pretends to speak of God in conclusive terms that pretension is a sure sign that the interpretation of faith has become metaphysical and that the God of faith has been changed into an object among other objects. All the words used by faith to designate the being and attributes of God are taken from personal life : love, wrath, the Father. These are all human figures of speech and faith is fully conscious of their symbolic character. They are not, therefore, dispensible terms; on the contrary they convey the very richest treasures. This situation presents a two-fold temptation. On the one hand, theology may become independent of all figures and seek to make its exposition of the content of faith completely free of all anthropomorphic character. This peril appears in scho- lastic theology and won there a tremendous, although a dubious, and brief victory. It appears, also, in all efforts to elaborate idealistic philosophy so as to make it adequate for theology. The other peril is that theology itself tends to regard sym- bolic expressions as adequate definitions. An illustration will clarify what is meant by this assertion. Biblical theology must come to terms with a phrase which no amount of criticism of biblical literature can get rid of, "the wrath of God", an obviously anthropomorphic term. What this term points to, intends, and reminds us of is often rejected because of its figurative and symbolic character. But when this happens something central to the concept of the holiness of God is completely ignor- ed or evaded. Theology must avoid both temptations : the temptation to subsume its particular kind of speech under general metaphysical categories, and hence destroy their particularity, and, on the other side, the temptation to regard its figurative and symbolic ways of expression as definitions which are identical with and at every point logically adequate to their object. The third affirmation is as follows: The affirmations of faith are statements about God's revelation or self-disclosure ; they do not pretend to speak from within God. God is to faith, to use the language of older theology, at one and the same time Deus Revelatus (the God who has disclosed Himself, but who is in Himself not identical with or exhausted in that revelation) and Deus Absconditus (God in [202]</page><page sequence="6">The Necessity of Faith the paradoxical form of his revelation, as He is in Himself and not in man's know- ledge). God, as He is in Himself, lies beyond any refinement of epistemological methodology or any other approach. But the Deus Revelatus is the God who has disclosed His nature and meaning and will. And this is the God with whom theology has to do. The problem is to ask what this means for the affirmations of faith. It is obvious that the idea of the hidden God limits the scope and the ambitions of the affirmations of faith. Faith does not know or see all, nor does it look at the whole of things with the eyes of God, and it makes nó such pretension. Faith understands, but it understands in part. It sees, but it, too, sees through the darkened glass. Faith does not have a ready answer to all the problem?, of the human spirit or to all the issues that arise in human existence. The revelation of God means a reve- lation of God's character in terms of His will and disposition toward us. And faith does declare a knowledge of that and provides a sure foundation for life. But this does not mean that all obscurity that surrounds and pervades human existence is by such a relationship obliterated. It does not claim that all these obscurities whether known in solitude or in community are evaporated by virtue of the gift of faith. The idea of the Deus Absconditus, of the hidden God, simply means for faith that limits must not be transgressed, that God, as He is in Himself, is no pos- sible inquiry even for Christian theology. The term, "the mystery of God", is the New Testament way of putting the matter. That the ultimate victory should be given in an overcome man ; that love-dying should be love-victorious, that a death should become the door to life - all of this is the heart of the mystery of God. But, the word mystery as I am using it here must be disengaged from that popular use whereby we talk about a mystery story. A mystery story is a story the mystery of which is evaporated when we find out who-dunnit. The mystery is no longer a mystery when you get to the last page. It is a mystery which is done away with in the disclosure of that which seemed mysterious because we didn't know the facts. Now, when religious speech uses the term mystery it does not use it to mean that which revelation evaporates or eliminates, but rather it is a pointing to, and an acknowledgment of its inability to master, that which evades all cognitive efforts. A true mystery remains a mystery even in its disclosure. Its salvatory gift can never be transformed into explicatory propositions. For instance when one says that God is love, this affirmation of faith comprehends in the sense that it grasps what is offered and lives by it. But this faith understands and comprehends in a way that also acknowledges that this love "passeth knowledge" and "passeth under- standing." I comprehend and understand this love when I accept it and live by it ; but I do not comprehend it in the sense that I ever understand this kind of love ! - which loves the unlovable, the rebellious, and that which scorns it. I have no empiri- cal material on which to say I can understand how God loves the sinner. In that sense the mystery remains a mystery. But the fact of the mystery of God's love becomes an "open mystery" when I accept the fact of it and live by it. [203]</page><page sequence="7">The Christian Scholar In the bibical terminology, the miracle (which we usually understand as cons- tituting a nature-problem, a wonder, an inexplicable phenomenon) is not pre- sented to us for that kind of judgment at all. The biblical speech announces mira- cles as signs advertising the mystery of God. In recent studies, a graduate student at my school undertook to examine the context of all the miracles that are declared to have been done by Christ in order to see if, in the New Testament documents, there is a vocabulary of response, a particular terminology which indicates how the men of Jesus' time and place were effected by the miraculous happening. This study found out that the word Ekstasis is almost a technical term in the New Testament for the kind of response which is evoked by the mystery of God. Miracle and ecs- tacy belong together. That is to say, the revelation of the mystery of God is creative, of a kind of response, which is proper to itself. The content of the mystery and the content of the response are absolute categories whose integrity belongs to the salva- tion-drama of the Bible. They are not capable, without distortion and reduction, of being subsumed under non-biblical categories. Now the fourth affirmation: The affirmations of faith have a paradoxical character. The paradox in the affirmations of faith is not of a temporary character which might be removed by a more refined analysis; it is of the structure of the affirmations. It inheres in the affirmations of faith because these directly or indirect- ly are affirmations about God. As long as faith asserts the reality of the God who works in history, who is at one and the same time the Eternal and the One who is contemporaneously active in history, then paradox will have to inhere. I can illus- trate in this way. How shall faith make an assertion about God who is soverign and Who, so it is declared, engaged Himself in historic decisions, in battles, and Who, in supreme revelation, died in the struggle? How can faith speak of sin which is declared both as something given and at the same time as personally actualized in my will, except in terms of paradox? I say I have faith in God ; and yet I know, at the moment I say that, that I do not have this faith as something that I possess (as I possess a jacket and a handkerchief and a wristwatch) but that I am possessed by this faith. In order to make this double statement, I must use paradoxical lan- guage. Luther said it very clearly when he said that the man of faith is always at one and the same time justified man and sinner. Paradox, to be sure, but confirmed in the life of every believer. But these are religious paradoxes ; the paradoxes of faith's statements. If one says that God in forgiveness receives the sinner into com- munion with himself, that God does that is a paradoxical act. But is is not a con- tradiction as a proposition of faith. IV Now a concluding word about the certainty of faith. The certainty of faith is not initially a psychological thing; it is a certainty about the revelation of God whereby faith lives. This certainty possesses a witnessing, life-formative character but not a logically demonstrable character. The word, necessary, should not be used [204]</page><page sequence="8">The Necessity of Faith of it. The idea that it can be based on rational proofs is contrary to the nature of both science and faith. That is why, for instance, biblical theology, within which tradition I operate, can today greet the workers in logical analysis as col- leagues and not as enemies. They seek to bring clarity and precision into the use of propositional language. And therefore one who operates with biblical theology, who is concerned to excise the particularity of biblical and one strand of historical theological speech is not thrown into a professional tizzy by the appearance of logical analysis of language. Neither does the certainty of faith possess a pragmatic char- acter. It cannot be certified by citing the significance of faith for other areas of life. And this, it seems to me, is the usual homiletical betrayal of Christian theology - that it tries to certify the reality and the validity of faith by showing it to be useful in other areas of life which have nothing to do with faith. There may be a connection between my relationship to God and the state of my ulcers ; but to argue that faith has, therefore, a greater validity is both bad religion and impossible logic. These relationships, to be sure, exist ; they are so central and pas- sionate and permeative that the faith-relationship can by no means be locked up within the theological personality but creates an existence for the individual which colors everything that he touches, everything he knows. These relationships are a large part of Western history. The role of faith in culture is discernible and vast. And the fact that I have not talked about it does not mean that I do not know anything about it or enjoy it. But it was not my purpose to point to that today. I am simply trying to say that this kind of pragmatic validation is always a temptation to Christian theology, for it is contrary to the theocentric character of faith and is more apt to confuse than to establish it.
