If you think of shoes as being simple commodities manufactured and retailed to satisfy physical and functional needs, you will be surprised by this collec- tion of short essays. Until recently the history of fashion and the history of design have considered footwear as accessories. Their importance has been hidden by an overall concern for clothing as one single unity. In the climate of cultural minimalism of the 1990s shoes found a new and important space: 'whether as fetish, sign, metaphor, objet d'art or collectible, shoes mediate between body and place, 367</page><page sequence="2">Reviews between self and other, in the continual, necessary human desire to situate identity within its realm of experience.'1 The ensemble of meanings shoes convey and the psychological, sociological, anthropological and sexual connotations attributed to them are the main subjects of a diverse collection of sixteen essays. There is a common denominator linking together different perspectives and approaches. As the editors Shari Benstock and Suzanne Ferriss say in the intro- duction, the purpose of the book is to understand 'what is it in our culture that has led to this fascination with shoes?' (p. 2). It is an attempt to propose a framework to recent studies of footwear based mainly on visual sources.2 Several points considered in the book update and expand important analyses on footwear by William Rossi in his The Sex Lfe of the Foot and Shoe (Routledge, London, 1977) and by Valerie Steele in her Fetish: Fashion, Sex, and Power (Oxford University Press, New York, 1996) and in her Shoes: A Lexicon of Style (Rizzoli, New York, 1999). Lorraine Gamman's excellent essay provides a series of questions about the role of shoes in modern- ity, further developed by other contributors. She investigates in particular the relationship between shoes, narcissism and self-representation. If on the one hand shoes are 'easy', attracting and gratifying more or less complex psychological and sexual needs, they can also be seen as conveyors of information- 'fragments' of personality. The contrast between choice and imposition is intelligently expressed in the shifting role of high heels between the 1970s and the 1990s. While in the 1970s the stiletto was connoted as a demonic (imposed by men) symbol of female subordination (moulding the female body), in the 1980s the passive female role became a self- inflicted abuse. Women became 'slaves of fashion'. The down-to-earth attitude of the 1990s proposed a new and healthy idea of high heels as a symbol of female self-esteem. Adornment was now part of personal realization. The world of shoes is not only connected to narcissism or self-esteem, it also hides an underworld of anxieties about social and sexual roles. Shoes can be used to assess gender performance or to masquerade an exaggerated type of femininity. As part of what Gamman calls 'shoe fixation', high heels for instance can be seen as penis substitutes (in an idea of phallic replacement) or as vaginas (central in Cinderella's slipper). Shoes become objects of desire, perversion and sexual arousal. In the first section entitled 'Perspective', the issues of presentation and representation of shoes are inves- tigated through three different but complementary essays. Julia Emberley enters the Bata Museum in Toronto to guide the reader in the understanding of the relationship between pedagogy and display in a shoe museum. She illustrates how shoes can become fetishized within a museum display. There is not a direct attribution of meanings, but a process that allows the modern consumer to reflect upon his/ her particular relationship with shoes compared with other, and very diverse, uses and values. The attribu- tion of meaning is an important subject also in Janice West's essay about 'The Shoe in Art, the Shoe as Art'. From Manet's Olympia (1863), through Van Gogh's A Pair of Boots (1886), to Andy Warhol's 1955 portfolio A La Recherche du Shoe Perdue and the later Diamond Dust Shoes (1980), footwear is examined as an icon of history expressed though visual art. Foot- wear is art not only when displayed as art, but also in other contexts in which shoes are able to express their value 'as exciting and challenging objects because of the specific relationship they have with the body and the self' (p. 44). The representation of shoes has found in our society modern means to reach a wider public. Cinema is at the centre of Maureen Turim's essay on the symbolic meanings of shoes in twentieth-century films. Shoes are used to encapsu- late within the short space of just a few photograms a series of moral aspects or the entire characterization of a person. In The Girl in the Big City (1913) the cruelty of the femme fatale is represented in her high-heel sandals stepping over the body of her lover and benefactor who committed suicide. From these early films through Battleship Potemkin (1927), The Gay Divorcee (1934), The Wizard of Oz (1939), The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946), Le Notti di Cabiria (1957) to more recent films such as The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (1994), the author investigates the use of footwear as representation of fetishism, gender and power relationships. In a session entitled 'Power', footwear is examined in its close links with the exercise of power in moder society. Power is not only the exploitation of cheap labour in the third world within a 'global, imper- ialistic and racist' capitalism created by the chic. If Nike with its ethical issues is representative of a long- standing problem between production and producers, shoes express other power relationships through 368</page><page sequence="3">Reviews consumption. In the eighteenth and nineteenth cen- turies wooden clogs (sabots) were synonymous with poverty and were considered by the leather-shod freeborn Englishman to be a tangible sign of French slavery. Similarly, Anthony Barthelemy shows how during most of the nineteenth century in the Amer- ican South brogans (very low-quality footwear) were synonymous with slavery. Produced in the footwear districts of Danvers and Lynn in Massachusetts by unskilled workers, brogans found their way to the Southern plantations where they became to symbo- lize not only the servitude, degradation and persecu- tion of the black population, but also the hypocritical behaviour of the 'abolitionist' Northern shoe manu- facturers. In the twentieth century shoes became one of the most important signs of what has been defined as the 'bloodiest century'. Ellen Carol Jones, in a touching essay entitled 'Empty Shoes', is able to express through absence the scale of the Holocaust. The materiality of thousands of shoes is the only thing remaining of their wearers. Visual evidence makes the reader understand both the atrocity of genocide and how inhumanity reached its most profound depth. Shoes are 'object survivors', lieux de memoir and '(im)possible evidence' of a psychologically incom- prehensible tragedy (p. 216). A section entitled 'Perception' develops the im- portant theme of the relationship between feet and shoes. In an essay on ballet slippers, Gerri Reaves notices how they 'hide the ugliness of abused feet and transform that ugliness into perfect supernatural feet' (p. 259). The pain of the act of dancing is dramatized in a kind of masochistic connection between foot binding, ballet and sexual pleasure. The bare feet of the first 'modern' ballerinas at the beginning of the twentieth century take the reader into the debate on 'the modern foot' analysed by Janet Lyon. From Jean Jacques Rousseau's Emile (1762) to Maud Allan performing as Salome in the early 1900s, the naked foot was considered both as a virtuous link with the natural and the primitive world and as the corrupted and scandalous moral degradation of the ungovernable modern world. An essay by Jaime Hovey (in a complementary section entitled 'Presentation') details through Daphne Du Maurier's Rebecca how shoes 'signify a notion of femininity as frivolous, commodified, and bourgeois at the same time as, serving as classic cliches of sexual fetishism, they mark a more general social ambivalence concerning female masquerade and phallic femininity' (p. 159). In an appendix, Hans Christian Andersen's The Red Shoes and Charles Perrault's Cinderella comple- ment three essays by Erin Mackie, Laura Mullen and Todd Lyon. Erin Mackie shows how in Christian Andersen's story Karen's red shoes represent the heroine's vanity and pride, 'functioning not merely as phallic substitutes but as vehicles for social ascen- dancy and bodily transcendence' (p. 10). The magic of the story turns Karen's shoes into a fetish punish- ment against her insatiable social ambition. By con- trast, in Cinderella the glass slipper is presented through a variety of perspectives. It is a magic object with different and contrasting characteriza- tions. On Cinderella's feet the tiny shoe presents a classic notion of eighteenth- and early nineteenth- century politeness. The petitesse of Cinderella's feet is a clear sign of her moral and sexual virtue. For the prince the lost slipper is a token of sexual desire, while for Cinderella's stepsisters is an uncompromising sign of unfitness for the magic world of the story. The book draws from the theoretical apparatus of recent cultural studies. The dynamism and eclecticism of such theories allows the content to expand well beyond the stated purposes of the book. If the fascination for shoes is an important subject, so also is the role shoes have in our society. The perspective is reversing: it is not only important to understand the intricate series of meanings conveyed by shoes, but also the meanings of the actions they represent.3 The explanation of the fascination for shoes implies an understanding of how much shoes represent us and can communicate to other people about us. This rather more social perspective is embraced in an essay by Tace Hedrick. Class, gender and ethnic identification are issues investigated in her analysis of the concept of latinidad in contemporary American society. The author shows how high heels-the so- called tacones-have become symbolic of the exotic beauty of the 'pura Latina' through the action of specialized magazines, such as Moderna and Latina, created for an Anglo audience. This essay raises a long series of questions that a deeper social analysis would have answered. For instance, is there a relationship between footwear and class? Footwear and the en- vironment? Footwear and age? Footwear and profes- sion? This can be a way to unravel complex theories that seem to forget both the existence of very 369</page><page sequence="4">Reviews different shoes and the difficulty of relating one type of footwear to one type of person. Why do working- class young males in Britain wear white leather trainers? Why are women's shoes in pastel colours and normally have names such as 'Lady' or 'Com- fort'? What is the role of very potent marketing strategies in influencing our perception of shoes?4 The focus on the twentieth century makes it difficult to appreciate fully the relationship between footwear and culture in its dynamic aspects. A relevant exception is an essay by Christopher Breward on 'Men's Footwear and Modernity'. He proposes an unexpected and fortunate combination between his- tory of dress and twentieth-century theories of archi- tecture and design. Men's shoes are taken by Le Corbusier as 'masculine' objects characterized by hygiene and modernity. Even more so, in Loos men's shoes are the embodiment of standardisation and functional convenience. The twentieth-century men's shoe is thus the result of a complex, dichot- omous process of evolution of male clothing from the 'criminal and corrupted female dress'. This excursus to the late nineteenth and early twentieth century high- lights a weakness of the book. To imbue shoes with certain social and cultural values does not mean to explain why and how a number of signs and meanings conveyed by shoes were created, while others dis- appeared or were transformed. In the book, the association between high heels and women (or between high heels and female castration), although minutely analysed, is taken for granted. Until the first decade of the nineteenth century high heels were used both by men and women and expressed class rather than gender differentiation. In the twentieth century the issue of social and cultural transformation is strictly linked to changes in footwear itself. The most import- ant case relates to trainers. They are representative of age differences as well as class differences. They embody a 'post-industrial' way of living and at the same time reinterpret the key elements of more traditional values. They are not only shabby footwear (as maintained by older generations) but attain 'macho' and technological elements within a symbol of the late twentieth-century genderless society. These questions should not be perceived as placing a limitation on what the book explains. They are underlining the book's usefulness as a means of raising a series of stimulating questions. The book gives to cultural historians and historians of fashion and design a new and fresh analysis of the way individuals relate to a part of their body and to the apparel associated to it. A mixture of sophisticated and learned discourse and more factual evidence taken from personal and empirical records is corroborated by a widespread use of visual material. The book allows footwear to be recognized as an integral part of the lives of billions of people. This is surely a step forward.
