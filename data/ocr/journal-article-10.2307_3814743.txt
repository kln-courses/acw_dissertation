<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sergei Kruks The Latvian Epic Ldcplesis: Passe-partout Ideology, Traumatic Imagination of Community In school, when I first read passages from Ldcplesis, I was convinced it was included in books in order to chastise children. A dull and bulky text was somehow to be appreciated as a sublime story, a source of heroic inspiration. Twenty years later, because my academic inter? ests encompass national narrative, I had to coerce myself to approach Ldcplesis again. How was I to do this analysis? What could one expect from this nineteenth-century romantic imitation of the epic genre? I found myself setting Ldcplesis aside for a while to direct my attention to the Estonian epic Kalevipoeg. Immediately I was struck by the joy and optimism emanating from the Estonian text, in contrast to the depression and anguish permeating the Latvian. I was astonished by the completely different images of the social world created in the two neighboring nations! These first impressions resonate with contemporary observations about Latvia and Estonia. Despite their similar cultural, religious, and historical background, it is common to hear public and private reit? erations of the differences between the two, especially in terms of their responses to Soviet domination and to the ways social change has been accomplished. In this article I argue that the differences are already coded in the ways distinct communities are imagined and social realities constructed in each country's rendering of its literary epic. Both epics are particular signs of conscious attempts in the nineteenth-century to invent identities for emerging "nations" (as part of so-called cultural awakenings) as well as attempts to create a fournal of Folklore Research, Vol. 41, No. 1, 2004 Copyright ? 2004 Department of Folklore and Ethnomusicology, Indiana University 1</page><page sequence="2">2 Sergei Kruks blueprint for social bonding. The premise of this essay is that these epics have become reservoirs of symbolic material?mythomoteurs? that have exerted influence on each nation's sociocultural develop? ment and that continue to shape contemporary discourses. Thus, if the value of literary work is defined by contemporary society (Fokkema and Ibsch 1995), then the analysis of epics might reveal what Fredric Jameson (1981) refers to as the "political unconscious" and provide a frame for interpreting certain contemporary questions. Literary epics, in this view, are ideological projects as well as artis? tic creations aimed at the conservation of oral cultures. Jan Mukafovsky (1970) has argued that the independent value of an ar? tistic artifact depends on its ability to attract non-aesthetic values. My aim here is to clarify the particular social values?eventually coded in the Latvian epic?that influence contemporary society. To this end, Kalevipoeg plays the role of the significant Other which allows me to reconstruct Lacplesis's identity. The Estonian epic provides an addi? tional set of paradigms for "heroic" deeds and characteristics, ones that are absent in the Latvian text. Paradigmatic analysis enables me to interpret the hero's identity in absentia?to imagine how the hero's character would have changed should he have behaved differently. The Latvian cultural hero Lacplesis and his Estonian counterpart Kalevipoeg are almost contemporaries. Friedrich Kreutzwald published his poem Kalevipoeg m 1857-61, whereas Andrejs Pumpurs's Lacplesis appeared in 1888. Both authors intended for their heroes to carry an ideological function?namely, that of fostering national consciousness. The epic Lacplesis proved to be highly resonant with Latvian social de? velopments over the next century. As the following discussion will indi? cate, the plot and the main characters as first presented by Pumpurs subsequently were borrowed by Janis Rainis at the turn of the century for his drama Fire and Night (1905). In 1986, Mara Zalite turned the familiar story into the rock-opera Lacplesis (2001). Both of these later works were written during periods of intense social change. The epic story of Lacplesis begins in the thirteenth century, as German knights arrive and impose their Christianity on the Latvian tribes. The pagan gods predict the subjugation of Latvians to foreign powers and designate Lacplesis as a national hero. Lacplesis is the son of a man and a she-bear, from whom he inherited bear ears, which are the source of his exceptional physical strength. A sage (closely identified with "the nation") named Vaidelots takes the nursing child</page><page sequence="3">The Latvian Epic Lacplesis 3 from his mother-bear at an early age and places him with a tribal chief called Lielvards. At the age of eighteen, Lacplesis gets his name, which means Bear-Slayer, when he saves his adoptive father by killing an attacking bear. Having revealed to Lacplesis his origins and the predictions about his heroic future, Lielvards sends him to the Burtnieki library?the repository of ancient scripts?which has been sunken by the devil to evict Latvians from their new settlement on the shore of Baltic sea. Along the way, Lacplesis meets an intelligent young girl named Spidala, who is a witch. Imperceptibly, he worms into her empty log, which delivers them to the Witches Sabbath, where he learns about an oath issued by Kangars to betray his people. On the way back, Spidala throws Lacplesis into the whirlpools of the Daugava River, but he is saved by the sorceress Staburadze and her apprentice Laimdota. Lacplesis meets a strong man called Koknesis, and together they continue to Burtnieki. Lacplesis defeats the Esto? nian giant Kalapuisis (Kalevipoeg), who has been instigated against the Latvians by Spidala and Kangars. Lacplesis raises the sunken pal? ace/library of Burtnieki. He becomes engaged to Laimdota, but she is soon kidnapped by Spidala and taken to Germany. Lacplesis un? dertakes the journey to find Laimdota, but it is Koknesis who man? ages to free her. Spidala breaks her contract with evil and becomes engaged to Koknesis. Back from his journey, Lacplesis battles the Germans, liberates several villages, and settles in Lielvarde with his wife, Laimdota. Here, the German Black Knight, who has learned the secret of the hero's strength from Kangars, arrives. The Black Knight challenges Lacplesis to a duel, succeeds in cutting his ears, but in the end, both warriors are submerged in the Daugava River. Lacplesis symbolizes strength, although some commentaries also stress his leadership capacities. Laimdota is intelligent but placid, viewed as an exemplary wife and often referred to as the symbol of Latvia. Kangars is the most powerful symbol of treason. The most controversial character is Spidala, who sometimes is defined as a lost sheep saved by Lacplesis for a subsequently restful life, but sometimes she is a sign of the knowledge the hero should have attained. In terms of its plot, the Estonian epic Kalevipoeg describes the ori? gins of King Kalev and his wife Linda, who are the parents of Kalevipoeg. After Kalev's death, a Finnish magician Tuuslar steals Linda. Kalevipoeg sets out to free his mother. He reaches Finland and kills Tuuslar, but learns that his mother is already dead. In Fin-</page><page sequence="4">4 Sergei Kruks land, Kalevipoeg buys a sword. In celebrating the occasion of the purchase a conflict arises between Kalevipoeg and a blacksmith's son. A drunken Kalevipoeg kills the young blacksmith, whose father proph? esied that the sword would revenge this death. Back in Estonia, Kalevipoeg visits his father's tomb to ask for advice. His father sug? gests that his son atone for his sin with good offices. Following Kalev's will, his sons engage in a struggle with each other, and through this competition they ascertain that Kalevipoeg is the strongest among them. He becomes the king and undertakes hard work for his country: he drains swamps, cultivates soil, and introduces gardens. When he hears about the threat of German invaders, he decides to construct four fortresses and travels abroad to procure the necessary timber. Meanwhile, a witch steals his sword but loses it in a lake. Kalevipoeg requests that the sword cut the legs of the one who "has brought it here." In another of his adventures, Kalevipoeg de? scends to the kingdom of death and saves young girls. Kalevipoeg builds a ship and sets off to seek the ends of earth. A stranger, who is the sage Varrak, agrees to show him the right way, but in exchange demands an object that is locked up in Kalev's house. When he real? izes that the earth has no limits, the hero sails back home. In Estonia he defeats the German knights and learns that the object demanded by the sage Varrak was the wisdom book. The hero must keep his pro? mise to Varrak. Later as Kalevipoeg crosses the lake in which his sword was lost, the blade, still lying at the bottom, cuts his legs. Kalevipoeg dies, having fallen victim to the unintentional consequence of his curse. Punishment falls on Kalevipoeg, who brought the sword "here," to Estonia, not on the witch, who brought it to the lake. Thus, the sword revenges the death of the Finnish blacksmith's son, though it is Kalevipoeg himself who bears double responsibility for this fatal out? come. The sword plays an ambiguous role, realizing the Finnish blacksmith's prophesy through Kalevipoeg's curse. By the nineteenth century, Latvian culture did not have any genu? ine epic songs upon which to build a literary epic. Pumpurs invented his hero, drawing inspiration from folk tales about the strong man Lacausis (Bear-ear), whose strength is also located in his bear-ears. Lacausis felt rejected by his neighbors, who could offer the hero only modest tasks to accomplish. Lacausis left his country searching for an opportunity to demonstrate his exceptional prowess.</page><page sequence="5">The Latvian Epic Lacplesis 5 Without great success, Pumpurs tried to imitate Latvian folk song meter. His pantheon of pagan gods was a pure invention. What is more, he was not entirely knowledgeable about the historical reality he sought to depict. Pumpurs endeavored to express in sublime style his nation's aspirations for freedom from the arrogant Baltic Ger? mans who still dominated his country and treated Latvians as a people who lacked an authentic culture of their own. The epic poem, there? fore, sought to fill a gap?to constitute a national "high" culture. Dur? ing the following century, as Latvians experienced intense German and Russian domination, the passion of national pride assigned Ldcplesis a special status. My argument in this article is threefold. First, the evaluation by different schools of literary criticism suggests that the canonization of Ldcplesis served particular ideological goals. Generic classification of the poem as epic allowed modern political discourses to claim his? torical legitimacy from the "ancients." Second, narrative analysis of the text reveals its failure to provide a framework for socialization. Although useful for political ideologies, the epic blocked reflection on the nature of the social bonds essential for nation-building. Third, a psychoanalytic approach to the text demonstrates that the construc? tion of cultural trauma as a loss of freedom is in fact a repression of the hero's unresolved Oedipus complex. The Significance of the Epic in the Representation of National Identity In The Republic, Plato considers the didactic role of mimesis. Fictional heroes instruct their readers through the nature of their achievements and failures, which point to the legitimacy or unacceptability of cer? tain goals, outcomes, or social institutions. My interpretation of the relationship between nineteenth-century epics and current political realities rests on the notion, articulated by scholars in a number of fields, that society represents itself in narratives that create models for understanding the world (see Brooks 1984; Jameson 1981; Lyotard 1984). In Lyotard's terms, narratives "define what has the right to be said and done in the culture in question. What is more, since they are themselves part of that culture, they are legitimated by the fact that they do what they do" (1984:32). In a similar vein, scholars in anthro? pology, social psychology, and folklore argue that identities are so-</page><page sequence="6">6 Sergei Kruks daily constructed through texts and narratives (Gergen 1999). Psy? choanalysts, in turn, contend that literature, and especially myths, express the fantasies of nations (Freud 1908) as well as satisfy the unconscious Oedipal desires of the audience (Brenner 1974). Narra? tives, thus, are a resource for producing meaning, for providing tan? gible material for "imagining a community" (Anderson 1983). They objectify abstract notions of sociability and effectively transmit them to the members of a community. As a result, the meaning of a text exceeds the author's subjectivity because it is produced on the basis of a certain "horizon of expectations"?on shared beliefs and con? ventions with predetermined boundaries and parameters (Jauss 1970). Nineteenth-century literary epics were conscious attempts to invent identities for emerging "nations." National Romantics, among them the authors of Kalevipoeg and Lacplesis, set themselves the task of in? venting a collective past and self (see Berelis 1999; Prieditis 2000). In Latvia, the fervor was so intense that a competition broke out among the Latvian literati to accomplish this honorable mission. Five variants of the national poems were submitted by Fridrihs Malbergis (in 1869 and 1886) andjekabs Lautenbahs-Jusmins (in 1880, 1885, and 1891). While there is a general consensus about the imperfection of Malbergis's quest, the third poem by Lautenbahs?entitled Niedrisu Vidvuds?re? ceived considerable attention from literary scholars, both positive and negative, thus demonstrating the social and political importance of a national poem and the salience of old forms in that quest. Evaluated from an ideological point of view, the choice of an out? moded genre as the basis for new literary work is not accidental. In the eyes of authors and audiences, the ancient roots of the epic en? dow it with a special legitimacy in culture. The epic is defined with particular stress on its significance as a fundamental medium for com? municating national identity?for embodying the history and aspira? tions of the nation in a grandiose and lofty manner. Epic heroes, with the aid of gods and magic agents, perform honorable deeds that serve to authenticate the hero's claim to represent the nation or race (Beckson and Ganz 1975; Cuddon 1998; Gray 1998). Along with the national flag and anthem, the epic is a recognized cultural symbol, a sign of national distinctiveness. In Latvia, the epic successfully conjoined with certain ideological desires. Latvians bolstered their self-respect, which had been dam-</page><page sequence="7">The Latvian Epic Lacplesis 7 aged by decades of denigration at the hands of Baltic Germans, by imitating ancient cultural tradition. In 1877, K. Ullmann, a Baltic German priest and linguist, had charged that Latvians had no epic because they had created nothing worthy of recording (quoted by Vike-Freiberga 1985). Immediately after the publication of Ldcplesis, almost as if in answer to Ullmann and other likeminded Baltic Ger? mans, a contemporary Latvian wrote: "Now Latvians have an epic that allows us to stand with other nations as equals" (quoted in Kalnins 1988:10). This idea echoes throughout the twentieth century. In 1990, a prominent Latvian literary critic wrote: "A. Pumpurs placed the Latvian nation beside those nations that had their heroic fairy tales and epic" (Cakars et al. 1990:313), while another asserted that the "epic lent [Latvia] a kind of prestige" (Kalnins 1988:10). The moral wound from the Baltic German aristocracy affected the development of social thought in Latvia in deep and long-lasting ways. In both the 1930s and the 1990s, in totally different socio? political contexts, intellectuals contended that certain cultural val? ues played a key role in justifying claims for national independence in broader international arenas (Priedite 1999). In 1988, after the premiere of the rock-opera Ldcplesis, a critic stressed that Latvian cul? ture (finally!) had attained its first rock-opera.1 After the restoration of independence in 1991, the broad international recognition ac? corded to Latvia's new status provided the new and inexperienced Latvian establishment with tangible proof upon which to build na? tional self-esteem and a positive identity. The influential poet Imants Ziedonis even invited intellectuals to create a checklist of cultural artifacts in order to isolate a particular Latvian code and its distinc- tiveness in comparison to other cultures.2 Emigre scholar Vaira Vike- Freiberga, who was elected president of Latvia in 1999 and 2003, observed that Latvians constantly imagine themselves in front of a panel of international judges (and not without reason) for whom the nation has to assemble a large file of evidence in order to prove itself the bearer of a distinctive culture. Only after such proof will the world officially admit that Latvians constitute a nation sufficiently different from all other nations to allow them their place among other nations of the world. (1992:190) The Latvian epic succeeded in "assembling" evidence for national distinctiveness but failed to provide the representation of an active,</page><page sequence="8">8 Sergei Kruks dynamic nation. Concern with identifying signs of distinctiveness dis? placed collective reflection on the nature of the social bond. In 1999, the Latvian literary historian Guntis Berelis argued that Lacplesis actually had created a cultural impasse. Ideological Use of the Epic Pumpurs fulfilled his ambition: his heroes continue to express ideas of freedom as they appear in subsequent literary and dramatic ren? derings. But Lacplesis is more than a reservoir of ideological symbol? ism. In Latvian culture, Lacplesis is available as one of only a very few anthropomorphic iconographic images. Together with his support? ing cast, he has been represented in theatre, cinema, opera, rock- opera, book illustrations, and sculpture. Lacplesis even materializes in playing cards and a mass-produced cap with bear-ears. Palpable on the material plane, Ldcplesislms created a topography of nationalism. Literary historians agree that the epic has produced a peculiarly Latvian cultural code, heroic image, and national ideology (Berelis 1999; Berzins 1935; Lasmanis 1975; Dravnieks 1976; Rudzitis 1988a, 1988b; Cakars et al. 1990; Hausmanis et al. 1998). Lacplesis turns out to be universal and easily adaptable to different political eras and situations, as illustrated by the following examples that span nine decades of symbolic use. As the sign of a warrior, Lacplesis has been used by all political regimes. In interwar Latvia (1918-40), Army Day (commemorated on November 11) and the first state military medal were named after Lacplesis. Lacplesis is represented on the Soldiers' Monument in Jel- gava (constructed in 1932) and on the Freedom Monument in Riga (built in 1935). The Ulmanis administration of 1934-40 proposed a comprehensive new edition of Pumpurs's works as a source of the "true Latvian" identity to promote patriotism. Printed in 1935 and introduced with portraits of state and military leaders, this volume was designed as a present from the war minister to dischargees from military service. In Soviet Latvia (1940-91), literary critics canonized Pumpurs's poem soon after the war. One of the most prosperous collective farms (kolkhoz) was built in the region immortalized by the epic and was named after Lacplesis. Lacplesis Street in Riga was among the few streets that retained pre-Soviet names. Wartime communist leaders</page><page sequence="9">The Latvian Epic Lacplesis 9 grasped the need to root their discourse in folk traditions and na? tional literature in order to oppose the "antipatriotic appeals of na? tionalists" in Nazi-occupied Latvia (Samsons 1984:108). In a wartime pamphlet entitled Germans in Latvia, the poet Janis Sudrabkalns drew contemporary parallels to the struggle of Lacplesis against medieval German knights. In addition, Pumpurs was said "to have urged Lat? vians to look for friends among Russians" (1942:57). In Sudrabkalns's poem "Lacplesis" (1943), the resurrected hero, together with the So? viet people, fights against the Nazis. "Lacplesis has always led Latvians in the struggle against their enemy," the poem declares. The epic characters were revived in a poem called "The Sun Gate" (1943) by Julijs Vanags. Soviet authorities demolished "nationalistic" monu? ments, such as the one built in Jelgava in 1932, but immortalized Lacplesis, nevertheless, in such new monuments as the one dedicated to Soviet soldiers built in Vietalva in 1966. During the period of Nazi-occupation of Latvia (1941-45), the same symbolism had been aimed against Soviets. Aversion of Ldcplesis sponsored by the occupying Nazi government became analogous to the German mythic hero Siegfried. Since it was impossible to deny the overt anti-German content of the epic, press accounts avoided specific references to the text. Instead, Lacplesis was treated as a sign of courage and military heroism in general. However, by introducing the topic of ancient Latvia, his name served as a pretext for speaking about the perennial struggle against Russian invaders.3 Toward the end of the war, the newspaper Ventas Balss (on November 10, 1944) urged Latvians to fight against the Soviet offensive: "The spirit of Lacplesis is not dead. Latvia will live!" A clandestine anti-fascist resis? tance group in occupied Latvia even used Lacplesis's name as a title of their newspaper in 1944. Duringperestroika (1985-91), M. Zalite's rock-opera, whose libretto was written in 1986 and which was performed in 1988, depicts (albeit still implicitly) Lacplesis battling against Soviet occupation. In Sep? tember 1988, the literary revue Karogs commemorated the centenary of the publication of Pumpurs's Ldcplesis and mobilized its symbol? ism during the so-called Third National Awakening in the last days of Soviet rule. The "topography of ethnicity," put into narrative form by the epic, rallied ethnic sentiments against communist rule, in a social movement that started as a protest against the building of a third hydroelectric station on the Daugava River. Soviet industrializa-</page><page sequence="10">10 Sergei Kruks tion efforts were represented as an assault on "Mother Daugava." The second station, which had been built in 1966, had already inundated a landscape considered to be a typical visual representation of the country. In 2002, a deluxe edition of the epic was published in indepen? dent Latvia. The fact that the preface was written by Latvia's presi? dent, Vaira Vike-Freiberga, confirms the ideological value of the poem. Indeed, it would seem that ideologies have burdened Lacplesis with the particular task of struggling on behalf of each and all. The Author's Purpose in Epic Function of the literary epic Since the epic text is aimed at formulating and conserving the most important materials of identity, it assumes the attributes of a broader voice, one that explains the reason for the ancients and the nation. Generic definition, thus, deletes the author's subjective voice; instead, the author takes on the role of a narrator, whose humble task is to systematize and transmit already existing texts and traditions. Criti? cal metatexts, furthermore, assign the epic the status of a canon. As Terry Eagleton has written in Literary Theory, "Literary criticism se? lects, processes, corrects and rewrites texts in accordance with cer? tain institutionalized norms of the 'literary'?norms which are at any given time arguable, and always historically variable" (1996:177). What then was the task expected of the epic author? Was it to preserve tradition or to invent contemporary social criticism? Why write an epic if a realist novel could respond just as well to contempo? rary actualities? Scholars today contend that the compilation of an epic is not the restoration of a lost tradition, but is instead an inven? tion, an interpretation of the contemporary situation in what is pur? ported to be the language of tradition. Expectations of Latvian literary critics Latvian literary historians have pointed to the "authenticity" of Pumpurs's epic poem by stressing that in his native village ancient traditions (without admixtures) were preserved for a much longer time than elsewhere in Latvia (Zeiferts [1922] 1993:400; Kalnins et al. 1963:518). In other words, Pumpurs was deeply connected to the</page><page sequence="11">The Latvian Epic Lacplesis 11 "real" Latvian worldview and such a metaphysical connection to the past grants him the right to teach others the "correct interpretation of ancient beliefs and traditions" (Hausmanis et al. 1998:176). In contrast, the poems intended as epics by Jekabs Lautenbahs failed to meet some of the basic criteria that audiences (and schol? ars) perceive as crucial for lending "authenticity" to epic creation. Latvian literary historians note that Lautenbahs lived and worked in Dorpat, a seventeenth-century university town in Estonia. He thus was detached from the Latvian environment. His writings "lacked ideo? logical goal-orientation, elements of national self-consciousness" (Hausmanis et al. 1998:178), and "references to actual problems" (Berzins 1935, vol. 3:33). In general, however, critics are inconsistent in evaluating Pumpurs and his rival poets. Lautenbahs is invalidated because he lacked a familiarity with folk tradition and he falsified folklore and history (Kalnins et al. 1971:90). Pumpurs is perceived positively despite his manipulation of the folklore incorporated in Ldcplesis and his being "too obviously in conflict with historical reality." As Aija Priedite notes in her article about the history of ideas in Latvia, to believe that Latvians in the thirteenth century were already familiar with the philosophical ideas of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, as manifested in the text, stretches the imagination too far. In fact, the ancient heroes conveyed modern ideas, reflecting nineteenth-century debates rather than recreating the ethos of an ancient historical era. (1999:241). Through time, there has been no consensus among Latvian liter? ary critics about the artistic value of Pumpurs's epic poem or the lack of merit of Lautenbahs's work. In 1907, Roberts Klaustins compared Ldcplesis to a "romantic love story" (180). Ludis Berzins, in 1935, de? clared without reservation that Lautenbahs's poem "outdid Ldcplesis as poetry" (1935:33). After the war, emigre critics issued reserved statements about the epic. Andrejs Johansons argued that Pumpurs's "poetic artistry was weak" (1953:107-9). Janis Andrups and Vitauts Kalve paid little at? tention to attempts at epic creation: they put the epic as a whole mildly in its place as "only a reflection of the fashion in vogue all over Eu? rope where great enthusiasm had arisen for the folk epic after the Nibelungenlied and the Old Norse epics had captured people's imagina-</page><page sequence="12">12 Sergei Kruks tion" (1954:104). In a school textbook, Ludvigs Viks stressed that Lacplesis was not a genuine national (folk) epic because Pumpurs had ignored the rhythm of folk poetry (1975:5-6). Arvids Dravnieks be? lieved that Lacplesis was not a good epic and that Lautenbahs was boring (1976:168, 215). Vike-Freiberga argued that Pumpurs's po? etry was often awkward and stumbling. In her opinion, Lacplesis is not a folk epic, but it "may be considered as truly a national epic in modern guise" (1985:524). Soviet literary criticism issued an unconditionally positive evalua? tion of Lacplesis. By strengthening its metanarrative status, the new ideologist sought legitimizing roots in historical tradition. The new canon was established by the leading writer Andrejs Upits (1947) in the preface to the first impressive Soviet edition of Lacplesis soon af? ter World War II. His reinterpretation targeted Soviet foes. Lacplesis, for example, was construed as anti-German as well as anticlerical. Moreover, Pumpurs is said to be "the first Latvian intellectual to real? ize his nation's agnation to Slavic nations" (Upits 1947:8). Expanded ideological interpretation was presented by the zealous scholar Janis Niedre, who found in Pumpurs characteristics that would please any orthodox Marxist. Niedre declared that Pumpurs was a materialist (albeit "naive") and a "dedicated Darwinist" (1953:233). Developing these ideas, the early school texts stressed that "allegorically Pumpurs expressed sympathy with the Slavic nations, especially with the great Russian nation" (Gaile and Grase 1958:138; Gaile et al. 1966:80; cf. Niedre 1953:250). Authors of more or less de-ideologized textbooks gradually abandoned such claims in the 1970s and 1980s. The canonization of so important a cultural text as a national epic was intimately connected to the social class of the writers and their respective ideological positioning within the literary movements of "national" and "pseudonational" (or in Soviet terms, "reactionary") Romanticism. Soviet scholars labeled Lautenbahs a reactionary be? cause he detached literature from the social struggles of his epoch; he was seen as a "poet of the highest circles of the Latvian bourgeoi? sie" (Kalnins et al. 1963:261-63, Kalnins et al. 1971:87, 221). Lau- tenbahs's disadvantage was his father's wealth. Pumpurs, in contrast, was born to landless parents and his social descent prohibited him from attending high school. Soviet critics pointed out that in "bour? geois" Latvia (the pre-Soviet independent republic), Lacplesis?as Pumpurs wrote it?was not positively evaluated. It was not recognized</page><page sequence="13">The Latvian Epic Lacplesis 13 as the national epic, but was published merely as an "epic song." So? viet ideology, on the other hand, assumed the role of rescuer of the precious ancient tradition, insisting that (contrary to interwar bour? geois criticism) "Soviet literary science considers Ldcplesis to be the national epic" (Kalnins et al. 1963:556-57). As a grand narrative, Ldcplesiswas interpreted as being in opposition to the upper- and middle- class of pre-Soviet Latvia and hence also to the Latvian emigration that sought to escape Soviet occupation. Schoolbooks taught pupils that the traitor Kangars "represented the upper class and the religious mi? lieu" (Gaile and Grase 1958:138). Gradually, in the new political con? ditions of perestroika, Soviet authorities moved toward rapprochement with those in the "bourgeois" diaspora. In 1987 the Soviet History of Latvian Literature stated that "values expressed in Ldcplesis exceed bour? geois ideals" (Cakars et al. 1987:309). Three years later, in the revised edition, this argument was omitted (cf. Cakars et al. 1990:317). Generic definition eased usage of the epic by and for different ideologies. It was an apolitical "voice of the people" par excellence, one that easily could be adapted to various sociopolitical conditions re? gardless of the specific context of its creation. It might be represented as a voice of the nineteenth century or as a voice of the ancients. Lacplesis as hero could be acknowledged by both the Soviet ide? ologist and the Latvians who fled to the West. Latvian refugees in Germany, for example, printed the epic immediately after the war, claiming that Lacplesis was a symbol of the "nation's strength and heroism" (Kreicers 1946:47). In 1983 at the conference on Baltic Stud? ies in Stockholm, Vike-Freiberga (1985) presented a paper on Ldcplesis. Today, I definitely interpret her treatment of the epic's dream of in? dependence as a gentle reminder from afar?addressed to Soviet col? leagues attending the conference?about the Soviet occupation. Whether this was really the case or not, the free circulation of the epic in the Soviet Union nevertheless downplayed its eventual anti- soviet or anti-Russian connotations in the nationalist discourse at that time. Having accepted and circulated the text, Soviet ideology man? aged more or less to neutralize and control its symbolism. Contemporary critics, it must be remembered, are evaluating Ldcplesis after it has been put on a pedestal and canonized as a grand narrative. A 1996 school textbook affirms directly that Lacplesis is a cultural metaphor that "serves as a standard for all of us" (Ausekle et al. 1996:95). Cultural historian Arturs Prieditis argues that Ldcplesis is</page><page sequence="14">14 Sergei Kruks among "the most outstanding and impressive artistic and socio- psychological works in Latvian culture" (2000:151). The updated lit? erary encyclopedia considers the poem to be "one of the most excep? tional achievements of Latvian literature" (Latviesu 2003:463). Literary scholar Biruta Gudrike, though, is more cautious, arguing that it rep? resents merely the author's highest artistic achievement (Hausmanis etal. 1998:174). The borrowing of the same symbols by the different political re? gimes is not simply fortuitous. National Romantics in the nineteenth century and Latvian nationalists and Soviet ideologues in the twenti? eth were confronting the same problem?the weakening of traditional social bonds as modernization and urbanization developed. Already in 1925 Klaustins predicted that decadent modernist literature soon would give way to the traditional ethnic ideals and didactic approaches specific to Pumpurs (151). Differing views over the relative mastery of Pumpurs and Lautenbahs illustrate that the creation of the epic is a project more closely related to ideological goals than to artistic mastery. Lacplesis was acclaimed by "traditionalists" who wanted a grand narrative in order to root their ideologies in the legitimate heroic past. "Modernized" urban circles of interwar independent Latvia and postwar emigration cautiously spoke out about the usefulness of such attempts to mock history. Epic Narrative Structure As a narrative, the epic explains the meaning of shared experiences and exemplifies the values of a community, at the same time that it serves to illustrate how the individual may be incorporated into the social body. The logic of the narrative is subordinated to these social goals. According to Tzvetan Todorov, an ideal narrative generally be? gins with a depiction of the social equilibrium being disrupted, and the subsequent story elucidates not only the nature of the destructive forces but also characterizes how stability might be restored (1971:50). The narrative shows the hero developing and maturing as he tests his abilities and compares his behavior to established social norms. In the process, as Algirdas-Julien Greimas (1966) points out, the social level, which includes law and contractual social organization, is correlated with the individual (or inter-individual) level, where personal values are generated through communication among human beings.</page><page sequence="15">The Latvian Epic Lacplesis 15 Epic narrative binds individual and social life together. According to Greimas, in the narrative scheme this process consists of the fol? lowing stages. First, the contract is initiated when a hero is assigned the duty of renewing a former state of affairs by redressing certain wrongs and filling a lack. It is a stage full of tension and intrigue. Subsequently, in order to be able to accomplish imminent decisive tests, the hero must acquire and demonstrate his competence through what might be called qualification tests. Finally, the "glory test" oc? curs at the sanction stage, when achievement is compared to the con? tractual demands. The hero's development through each of these stages is guided by four modalities (or ways of being) that demon? strate in concrete ways how he meets the preconditions essential for fulfilling the social duty: ? having-to-do ? wan ting-to-do ? being-able-to-do ? knowing-to-do (Greimas 1983:76-81). When duty is received ("having-to-do"), it must become transformed into "wanting-to-do." In other words, the hero's understanding and conscious acceptance of responsibility indicate that he has internal? ized the value system of the social environment and is personally motivated to fulfill the proffered duty. The next two modalities?"being-able-to-do" and "knowing-to- do"?are the essential steps for attaining the necessary qualifications. Both entail the acquisition of communication skills, which are a pre? requisite for obtaining help (magic tools, advice, etc.). As the hero tests different ways of behaving, he not only recognizes which of his own actions are desirable and expedient but begins also to grasp the related social values. He comes to realize that he cannot fulfill his duty without the help of others. As helpers offer or withhold assis? tance, they give him positive or negative feedback about his behavior and thus nurture his growing self-evaluation. The competence the hero acquires in the course of his adventures is vital for accomplish? ing the decisive tests. In the narrative, of course, things do not develop so smoothly. The hero is not a passive instrument who follows the will of a higher authority. Instead, he is free to choose from alternatives. For Greimas, the refusal to acquiesce to a contract has positive implications: it brings</page><page sequence="16">16 Sergei Kruks about "the affirmation of the individual's freedom" (1970:210). In fact, the availability of choice constitutes a hero's maturation test. Freedom to choose implies a sense of personal responsibility. The dynamics of the epic lead either toward a renewal of the contract within the framework of the previous order or to the sketching out of a new order. Similarly, Paul Ricoeur points out that narratives make choices visible through the depicted procrastinations arising in the course of the quest: "by means of the alternatives, the bifurcations, the contingent connections, and finally by the unforeseeable outcome of the quest as a success or a failure" (1985:48). In this way the narra? tive presents different modes of behavior, while the hero's trial and error, his faults and misbehavior as concomitant to free choice, com? prise the motor of the story. Greimas's model of the hero's develop? ment through narrative serves to illustrate how Lacplesis?in spite of his popular appeal and adoption by nationalist endeavors?evades the challenges of heroism and offers an inadequate model for moral character and social responsibility. Comparative Analysis of the Latvian Lacplesis and the Estonian Kalevipoeg Comprehending duty In Lacplesis it is not easy for the reader to define the hero's task: is it simply to be heroic or to undertake an important duty? Gods and ter? restrial moral authorities offer little help in answering this question since they avoid making unequivocal pronouncements. Perkons (the god of thunder) is said to have "blessed" Lacplesis for having lofty goals and forecasts "the life of a hero" for him (Pumpurs 1988b:I, 244) .4 The sorceress Staburadze, a female character who functions as a mediator between the gods and humans, is slightly more specific: "The gods des? tine you ... to earn glory in your nation" (II, 721). In her estimation, then, the epic is about fame and glory rather than about fulfilling duty or exacting revenge. The hero's adoptive father, the tribal chief Lielvards, declares: "Truly you will be a chosen one, just as it has been predicted" (II, 39). He is echoing the earlier message of the sage Vaidelots: "The boy has been fated by the gods to become a national hero" (II, 53). Through such flattery, the narrative loses its social di? mension. The outcome of the final stage?sanction?is independent</page><page sequence="17">The Latvian Epic Lacplesis 17 of the hero's performance, which makes it possible for Lacplesis to be perceived as a hero despite his failure to resist foreign invaders. He, however, is not to blame because the contract stage did not, in fact, take place. Social and divine authorities were reluctant to formulate his duty explicitly. Pumpurs reveals his bewilderment in the face of changing value systems. By making Lacplesis a vacillating character, Pumpurs avoids a straightforward condemnation of the Christianity and Westernization imposed on his country. Spidala alone comes closest to formulating the hero's duty explic? itly, but her words are undermined by her rather controversial char? acter role. She once abandoned her gods to enter into a contract with witches who would allow her access to unorthodox knowledge. Intelligent and beautiful, Spidala is constantly attempting to seduce Lacplesis. It is she who urges Lacplesis to undertake his task without delay and as a matter of duty: While you wander on the distant sea Foreigners are burning our fatherland! Hurry, Lacplesis, hurry home, Take revenge on the foreign oppressors! (V, 325-28) On the one hand, the absence of an explicitly formulated duty by recognized authorities excuses the hero who is unwilling to act. On the other hand, the hero is able to ignore Spidala's unequivocal pa? triotic interpretation because she is a character who already has dared to defy traditional authorities by acceding to the knowledge of witches. In the Estonian epic the duty Kalevipoeg must fulfill is unam? biguously communicated to him. Before his death, the father, Kalev, communicates the rules of successorship to his sons. He mandates a ritualistic contest among the brothers. When Kalevipoeg proves his strength by winning this contest, he confirms his new social position explicitly. Furthermore, by consciously taking on the new duties, Kalevipoeg bids farewell to his unfettered adolescent life: "When I was made ruler, chosen to be the king, I had to quit my nest. ..." (Kreutzwald 1982:102). Skills and competence For contemporary Latvian culture, some rather unwelcome effects stem from the epic's failure to modulate "knowing-to-do" positively. Pumpurs provides Lacplesis with ample occasions for proving his physical</page><page sequence="18">18 Sergei Kruks strength, especially in the early stage that establishes his qualifications as a "hero." In a key episode, for example, Lacplesis sets sail to free his fiancee, Laimdota. But the reader knows that his friend Koknesis has already freed her. The reader is invited to excuse Lacplesis's delay? the hero lingers on enchanted islands where he narcissistically demon? strates his own physical strength. What is more, having lost his way at sea, he is advised to return home rather than follow a dangerous route in search of his beloved. Lacplesis accepts this advice. Pumpurs, in his depiction of the hero, seems to have built in certain fatal character flaws, while implicating the reader in excusing them. Most crucially, Lacplesis does not demonstrate skills associated with learning from social contacts, from helping others, or from the necessities of everyday life. On the contrary, all the helpers encoun? tered during the journey provide assistance without ever testing the hero and his companions: "They lacked nothing, everyone was happy, thus no one thought to leave the island and sail home" (Pumpurs 1988b:IV, 641). Another time, on another island, they "spent many a pleasant day. . . . the land's natives one after another hastened to pro? vide pleasure" (IV, 916-17). Sorceress Staburadze saves Lacplesis from being turned into stone, a fate that befalls everyone else who falls into her whirlpool. In this case, the helpers function is a means for testing the hero's moral qualities. It is in the nature of the epic genre that the acquisi? tion of magical tools and support depends on the hero's ability to communicate effectively with others and to gain their respect by dis? playing socially acceptable behavior. Language skills, thus, are an in? dicator of socialization. But Lacplesis is taciturn. He does not even sing lyric songs to his beloved. The epic manifests the hero's pathological narcissism: he accom? plishes heroic deeds alone; his companions frequently annoy him. They are represented as lazy and irresponsible. Lacplesis alone de? feats the ogres because he has failed to lead his men. In liberating Laimdota, he boldly refuses help and then fails to do it by himself. His lack of intellectual astuteness thwarts his ability to anticipate fu? ture events. After wining back his native village of Lielvarde, for ex? ample, Lacplesis organizes a feast for all his warriors, divides the booty among them, and then lets them go home without thinking about future defense needs and capacity. Lacplesis and his spouse Laimdota "lived for themselves, rewarded for their glorious deeds" (VI, 846-47).</page><page sequence="19">The Latvian Epic Lacplesis 19 In contrast, Kalevipoeg experiences constant self-development, and the social environment that imposes different tests on him actively shapes his character. He learns from his adventures. While he admits that searching for the ends of the earth was totally meaningless, he recognizes that the adventure nevertheless increased his knowledge: "on our errant route ... we found many truthful tidings: that the wide world has no end" (Kreutzwald 1982:212). Unlike his Latvian coun? terpart, Kalevipoeg ignores an opportunity to show off his exceptional strength to his travel companions. He is aware of his shortcomings and admits the necessity for continual self-improvement: "On turn? ing back a man has more wisdom than he had upon departing" (212). Kalevipoeg's power is not his exceptional physical strength. Occasion? ally he provides assistance to ordinary humans and small animals. Such acts do not require extreme effort and therefore do not high? light his prowess. His strength, rather, is in his character and his abil? ity to interact with others. Ldcplesis: Fearing freedom, shrinking from blame Lacplesis's indifference to social duty stems from a double bind. The gods pick him as a hero but simultaneously prophesy his subjugation to a foreign power. They thus consign him to failure. If he fulfils the prescribed duty, he realizes the divine wish but destroys the gods' au? thority by proving his ability to influence social events. The documents belonging to the ancients?found in the recovered Burtnieki library depository of the nation's knowledge?acknowledge that a human can vie successfully with the gods, but that such a presumption makes a mockery of the old gods. Pumpurs refrains from direct comment on this dilemma except to say "Human will is free" (Pumpurs 1988b:III, 94) and to imply thereby that the days of the pagan gods are numbered. Lacplesis makes excuses for himself, explaining his captivity in terms of a prophecy of the gods. He avoids situations where he would have to make a subjective decision. In the Latvian epic, warriors are not in a hurry to fulfill their duty. Instead, when Lacplesis's beloved Laimdota is stolen, he first grows despondent and locks himself in his stepfather's castle, then spends a lot of time traveling to distant lands and visiting enchanted islands before calling off a rescue attempt and returning home. Lacplesis does not hasten to fulfill his duty because he is already a hero by definition. In Rainis's words, "His fate is to become a hero."</page><page sequence="20">20 Sergei Kruks He is preoccupied with safeguarding an institutional position, keep? ing honor and glory pure. Social action could test his skills and com? petence and throw doubt upon his heroic status. Lacplesis therefore is afraid of responsibility that entails freedom of choice: he dreads making a wrong decision. At one point, Lacplesis's friend Koknesis voices an indirect criticism of the hero's sterile lifestyle. Koknesis makes clear that he recognizes the importance of social tests for shap? ing character when he praises Spidala (with whom he had fallen in love) for finally bringing to an end her contract with evil: "Who falls to rise again?that person will stand more firmly than the one who has not yet fallen" (Pumpurs 1988b:V, 538-40). In the epic, a nation unwilling to challenge the gods clings to its identity in tradition, even if by doing so it deprives itself of the freedom to resist divine proph? esies about subjugation to foreign power. Lacplesis displays manic depressive psychosis. In his behavior, pe? riods of passivity and melancholy are followed by demonstrative, if meaningless, outbursts offeree that do not jibe with social need. His access to the skills essential for proving his decisiveness is impeded by his recurrent depressive states and his fixation on bolstering his self- confidence by demonstrating physical strength. It is not Kangars's treason (revealing to the crusaders that the hero's strength was in his ears) that takes Lacplesis's life, but rather that his amour-propre is fa? tally wounded by the German Black Knight, who doubts his physical strength. Wishing to save his reputation, Lacplesis accepts a duel with him and loses his life. Kalevipoeg: Pragmatic actor The Estonian epic Kalevipoeg constructs a completely different concept of individual freedom. The hero, Kalevipoeg, has not been selected by the gods but has won his status through his own actions. The epic mod? els an active individual who manifests pragmatic and socially respon? sible behavior. Warned about impending war, Kalevipoeg prepares by building shelters for the women, children, and elderly people. (Lacplesis, on the other hand, devastates villages as he chases crusad? ers.) Kalevipoeg acts tirelessly: "Don't throw today's chores onto tomorrow's peg! If you want to . . . see a profit in your work, then don't waste time?hesitate no longer!" (Kreutzwald 1982:43). When individual physical strength and determination are insuffi? cient, Kalevipoeg, in contrast to Lacplesis, seeks out and relies upon</page><page sequence="21">The Latvian Epic Lacplesis 21 the advice and assistance of others?his brothers, foreigners, and magic animals: In Finland, in that granite country, I'll be sure to find some kinsmen, acquitances in Lapland, old friends from the isle, who'll put me on the path, direct me toward the right trail. (200) He not only appreciates external help and advice, but also repays it in kind. Communication with helpers requires language skills, and Kalevipoeg talks and sings freely. He even seeks discursive resolution of conflict. The Kalevipoeg provides a more useful, usable past by characteriz? ing the people as equal and capable social actors. In one instance, Kalevipoeg shames his frightened compatriots when he urges them to action against invaders: "What are the young men doing then? Are there no brave ones growing, no strong men rising?" (251). The hero fully trusts his people and perceives himself as their partner. The epic does not bind the nation's fate to his exceptional physical strength, but instead underlines the importance of collaborative action: "When the strife seems more severe . . . then I myself will come to stride ahead as your helper!" (111). Kalevipoeg does not try to avoid unexpected situations that might expose his weaknesses. When he acts badly, he reflects upon the con? sequences. For example, Kalevipoeg seduces a girl; another time, while in a drunken stupor, he kills the son of the blacksmith who carved his sword. Through such episodes, the topics of guilt and personal re? sponsibility enter into the narrative, and internal psychological dy? namics are represented as the foundation for individual growth. In the final analysis, faults and misbehavior constitute the intrigue that guides the whole story. War and the hero's own death are the nega? tive consequences of his unacceptable behavior. In contrast to the Latvian epic, Kalevipoeg interprets war as the necessary cost for the abuse of morals rather than as the whimsical decision of gods: The spilling of innocent blood passes judgment on you; blood strives for blood's wages, death brings forth more death. (115)</page><page sequence="22">22 Sergei Kruks Military defeat is represented as an unintended by-product of human curiosity and aspiration for knowledge. Kalevipoeg deliber? ately relinquishes the precious wisdom book?the legacy of his fa? ther Kalev?in exchange for the chance to satisfy his curiosity about the end of the Earth. He accepts the freedom to make decisions and to act, but he also accepts responsibility for his actions. Kalevipoeg suggests that perhaps the hero's failure stems from his hav? ing forgotten about or ignored the nation's wisdom book. Future suc? cess will derive from knowledge, not from physical strength. Pumpurs actually comes to the same conclusion in Lacplesis when he implies that Germans conquered Latvian territory through a reliance on the Chris? tian word. Both epics inserted their heroes into similar social conditions, but the Latvian text failed to render the hero's successful socialization. The reason might lie in the different personal dispositions caused by probable flaws in Lacplesis's individual identification process. Psychoanalytic Approach: The Epic Constructs Trauma Lacplesis sounds a low-spirited note: the gods announce a long period of slavery for the people. Pumpurs depicts a world in fragments. The main female characters?Laimdota and Spidala?are motherless. Lacplesis's own origins are unclear. Nothing is known about his fa? ther. His mother is a bear. From her he inherits the bear ears that endow his supernatural strength. In the beginning of the epic, it is said that the sage Vaidelots had taken the suckling child from his bear mother. The epic's tone suggests that the deprivation of his mother's breast at so early an age has caused Lacplesis's depression. Repeatedly he seeks the mother's womb: he holes up in a log and in caves, is almost swept away when he falls into a whirlpool. When Lacplesis drowns in the Daugava River, it is a logical relief for his anxiety: he has at last fulfilled his desire to find "happiness at the beloved breast" of which Vaidelots deprived him. The theme of fragmented families suggests that the story lends itself to a psychoanalytic approach. In understanding the process of infant identification, psychoanalysis assigns a paramount role to the Oedipus complex (Freud 1924; Lacan 1966). A child, given the physi? cal proximity to his mother, considers himself to be the object the mother lacks. The father's role is to interfere in these dyadic rela? tions by demonstrating that the mother does not constitute a part of</page><page sequence="23">The Latvian Epic Lacplesis 23 her child's ego. Slavoj Zizek describes how the child is forced into a choice between le pere ou pire?father or worse (1992:75-76). By ac? cepting the father's prohibition against being-with-mother, a child attains autonomy. Thereupon he may become a subject, able to act on his own desires rather than remain an obedient object to his mother's desires. The process known as "symbolic castration" denies the child his sense of omnipotence but sets him free from sub? mission. The path to freedom entails accepting the interdiction and realizing one's own imperfection. Pumpurs himself has associated symbolic castration with access to culture. With regard to his epic poem, he commented that the bear ears that are the source of physi? cal strength symbolize the half-wild Latvian people. In order to be? come cultured, the hero must have his ears cut (Pumpurs 1988a). In the epic there is no father figure capable of accomplishing this func? tion. Spidala undertakes several tentative moves to do it. In the guise of a witch, for instance, she leads the assault when a monster tries to slash off Lacplesis's ears. The foreign German Black Knight finally accomplishes the function, but even this act does not save the hero. Having lost his ears, Lacplesis sinks into the Daugava River, thus meta? phorically returning to the maternal body. The wild ears seem in? deed to annoy Latvian culture, and it would seem that iconographic tradition has accomplished the symbolic castration. In book illustra? tions, sculptures, and in theater depictions, Lacplesis's ears are dis? guised under his hair or shown as an element of his hat. In Kalevipoeg, family matters are the exact opposite. The Estonian epic begins with a joyful delineation of the origins of the tribe. The succession of weddings and births creates a sense of wholeness and completeness. Kalevipoeg draws strength from his mother: he nurses until the age of three and his mother "sought help for her son . . . and [gave] the feeble babe strength" (Kreutzwald 1982:100). Also, the father is actively present and, even after death, is a continuing re? source. When Kalevipoeg and his brothers need counsel or have lost their moral vision, they visit the father's tomb: "Your dead father's shade will lead his son's steps even from the grave" (93). For Lacplesis, water usually reminds him about his regressive de? sire to be-with-mother. In the Estonian epic, water does not represent a menacing force that weakens Kalevipoeg's strength of will. Whether sea, lake, or river, all are simply impediments to overcome as he pur? sues a particular goal:</page><page sequence="24">24 Sergei Kruks Haven't I tried my luck, earlier, one hundred times: in Lake Peipsi, without fear, in Vorts Lake without a quiver, with no dread at Kaiu Pond; I've waded through the Baltic Sea, with a burden, without falling. (200) The Latvian epic articulates the hero's infant trauma?the sage Vaidelots has deprived Lacplesis of his mother, and the child per? ceives it as an assault on the freedom to make his own choices. The epic expresses sympathy with Lacplesis's wish to refuse the prohibi? tion of the father (or whoever attempts to fulfill this function) and constructs trauma on the social plane as deprivation of the land by foreigners. For example, the German knights are advised to intro? duce Christianity in the village of Turaida because it is "fertile ground in which to plant [their] seeds" (Pumpurs 1988b:III, 130). Later, the epic recounts the effects of this "planting": "in fertile fields barley and rye swayed in golden waves ... fat cattle, cows, bulls grazed in green pastures" (VI, 561-65). There are no other illustrations of the wealth and fertility of the land in Pumpurs's poem. The native land is understood merely as a distinctive sign that permits the narration of a common identity rather than as an object that allows and requires human management. Here, symbolic coitus projects the individual trauma onto the social plane: "to plant seeds" is to penetrate the womb of the mother-land, perceived as an act of violence. From the child's point of view, the man is an enemy because he hurts the mother; from the community's point of view, he is a foreign conqueror who hurts the land. It is Vaidelots, the sage of the nation, who takes the child away from his mother, but the subsequent feelings of hate are directed against the traitor Kangars and against foreigners who con? quer the land. Mother and land are precluded from concrete rela? tions; they are idealized and imagined in such a way that they are not subject to real activity. Society in Search of Social Values Subsequent renditions of the Latvian epic plot in the play by Rainis and the rock-opera by Zalite give more insight into the relative sig? nificance of "being-able-to-do" and "knowing-to-do" as national iden-</page><page sequence="25">The Latvian Epic Lacplesis 25 tity and the existing political order were problematized during times of significant change?the first Russian revolution in 1905 and perestroika in 1980s. The theme of Lacplesis's reluctance to choose action is picked up in Rainis's play in an exchange between Lacplesis and Spidola.5 She taunts him to take a stand: Lacplesis: "I was sent to struggle against evil." Spidola: "Oh, you've been sent! It's not your choice?" (Rainis [1905] 1980:190) Rainis reinforced the importance of Spidola by associating her with knowledge. The interaction between Spidola and Lacplesis is particu? larly instructive in this regard. Having evicted Germans at the early stage of conflict, Lacplesis believes that the struggle is over and that his heroic duty has been fulfilled: "I have achieved everything, now I'll live for myself (284). In vain, Spidola warns him to strengthen defenses in anticipation of a new assault by the Germans. Lacplesis ignores her repeated urge "to grow up." Knowing the cunning of the Germans, she tries to talk him out of dueling the Black Knight: "You have a greater task: to live for the people, not to die!" Lacplesis over? estimates himself and boldly rejects Spidola's advice because he is publicly provoked by the Black Knight and must take vengeance. As a result, the hero dies in the duel, leaving the nation with neither physi? cal support nor an ideal symbol of resistance. Zalite aggravated the problem in terms of the messages conveyed to eager audiences in her perestroika-era rock-opera produced in 1988. She eliminated the question of "knowing-to-do" altogether by doing away with Spidola as a character. In the black and white terms of Zalite's work, the nations' subjection to the foreign power is formu? lated in terms of treason. Compare this to the popular Latvian slogan of perestroika: "Look for Kangars in our nation!" Implicitly, Zalite in? vited the audience to accept Soviet occupation on the grounds that Latvia lacks and cannot obtain what would be decisive for restoring national freedom?namely, physical force. In contrast to Rainis, she treated knowledge as insufficient. In his 1905 interpretation of Ldcplesis, Rainis concluded that the nation is rendered passive because it "has bound its destiny to one man." In his play, the people do nothing but lament. Eighty years after Rainis, Zalite also invited the people to "cry out more loudly" for the one and only exceptional man.</page><page sequence="26">26 Sergei Kruks Implications for Contemporary Identity Discourse Ernest Gellner claims that "nationalism is not the awakening of na? tions to self-consciousness," but the invention of "nations where they do not exist" (1964:168). The ideology of nationalism has not suc? ceeded in inventing solidarity and social cohesion. Though often considered as a natural phenomenon, in reality nationalism must al? ways be created from scratch. In the Latvian case, Pumpurs and sub? sequent literary historians have ignored the social dimension of Lacplesis. Epic as a genre has been understood only as an artifact, as a compulsory attribute of a community and as that which makes it dis? tinctive from other communities. In the 1880s as in the 1980s the discourse of ethnonationalism required compiling a checklist of cul? tural things, but it failed to realize the full implications of the cultural process of creating social meaning. Culture embodies a potential pattern of meanings inherited from the past, immediate or distant. As Mary Douglas and Baron Isherwood contend in The World of Goods, culture is a canopy for the interpretative needs of the present (1996:42-43). Lacplesis steers its readers toward understanding the present through the prism of failure, passivity, and self-victimization. Kalevipoeg, by contrast, encourages the collective action and risk that are essential for development. As a blueprint for contemporary action, the Latvian literary epic has failed to project a lofty hero. Lacplesis neither fulfils the tasks set for him nor proves capable of mobilizing society around an articu? lated goal. Despite these failures, the epic insists that the long awaited and much desired national freedom can be realized only through his resurrection?through his heroic actions alone. At the same time, Lacplesis precisely delineates the root cause for the successive cultural traumas that Latvians endure: through its characters and plot actions, it demonstrates that society depends on collective action rather than on a supernatural hero. Sociologists argue that civic passivity is borne out in contemporary Latvian society. The rates of political participa? tion and non-governmental collective activity are rather low (cf. Tabuns and Tabune 1999; Zepa 1999). Public opinion echoes the epic's conclusion, namely, that the nation's success depends on an outstanding leader. Although there is no lack of contenders for po? litical leadership and time and again a new candidate occupies the absent hero's position, the chosen leader loses popularity and sup-</page><page sequence="27">The Latvian Epic Lacplesis 27 port soon after new parliamentary elections. Also studies of profes? sional values among contemporary business managers in Latvia have shown that they avoid risk-taking and decision-making because they value individual achievement more highly and are eager for fame. These behavioral values manifest a low commitment to social respon? sibility (King 1996; Kenins Kings 1999). The Latvian epic constructs the cultural trauma as the conquest of the land, thus displacing the source of anxiety, locating it outside the ethnic community. Slavoj Zizek, applying a psychoanalytic ap? proach to ideological discourses, argues that a traumatic event is first of all a phantasmal construction that fills in the void in a symbolic struc? ture. It is the retroactive effect of a given structure (1980). National Romantic Pumpurs provided the emerging nation with symbolic re? lief for a social identity injured by the disdainful attitude of Baltic Germans. But as soon as the effect of the imagined trauma is removed ? once the land is regained and an independent state is (re) established? the national community is left to face the very real social deficiencies that escaped the epic's concern and direct symbolization. Persistent traditional symbolic forms preclude contemporary public discourse from coming to grips with changed social realities. The epic diverts concern from the flaws of individual self-development to objective social constraints. The reader is asked to excuse Lacplesis's unwill? ingness to learn from Spidala, co-operate with others, and assume responsibility because his freedom to act is said to be limited by evil and foreign powers. Today foreign pressure and immoral politicians are blamed for the drawbacks of society. The renewed order is not acknowledged: the desire that materialized as the recovered inde? pendent state is denied and the state is now said to have been "sto? len" by corrupt politicians. Political and media discourse attempts to construct a new national identity deriving from social bonds across diverse economic and political interests. Politicians and ordinary citi? zens are presented with a moral imperative defined as "thinking on the state scale" ("valstiskd domdsana"). Literally this call invites citi? zens to "look beyond their own private courtyard," to assume responsi? bility for the state that finally has become "ours," a matter for the citizens themselves. The identity discourse is seeking new heroic personages and symbolic forms to communicate such characteristics as self- reliance, social activity, responsibility, and accountability (cf. Lerhis and Ancans 2003).</page><page sequence="28">28 Sergei Kruks Whenever Latvians read Lacplesis or see it performed or other? wise indexed, they are reminded that the hero perished without hope of fulfilling his duty. They are asked to wait for his return instead of concerning themselves with figuring out ways to assume responsibil? ity and undertake redressive action themselves. Perhaps Lacplesis once provided relief for a nation subjugated to foreign power. Perhaps by inviting readers to accept the lack of freedom, the epic secured au? thoritarian political ideologies with a passe-partout cultural frame that downplayed civic activity. Today civic society requires a cultural frame that supports the imagination of an active, confident community. University of Latvia Riga Notes 1. See Literatura un mdksla, November 18, 1988, p. 8. 2.
