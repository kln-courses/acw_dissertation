<plain_text><page sequence="1">From Praxiteles to de Chirico: Art and Reception ROSEMARY BARROW This paper aims to interrogate concepts of the classical tradition through an examination of the vi- sual reception of the sculptural female nude. Praxiteles's fourth-century BCE Aphrodite of Cnidos and her variants are cited as a significant presence in the canon of western art through a discussion of paintings from different art historical periods and styles. Works by Titian, Alma-Tadema and de Chirico present complex commentaries on the relationship between ancient art work and its recep- tion and offer not just comparisons but dialogues between antiquity and modernity. Lacanian con- cepts of desire are utilized to frame a discussion of the originary erotic meaning of the Greek sculp- tural nude and the appropriation or negation of this meaning in terms of artistic reception. e reception of the ancient past makes a distinctive and vital contribution to the aes- thetic continuum: in the visual sphere, in particular, renewals and reworkings of clas- sical models claim a privileged position in the canon of art-historical achievement. At the same time, reception represents an important element in the modern academic quest for understandings of antiquity. Reception theory foregrounds the importance of the reader for the construction of meaning and thus the relationship between image and interpreter is necessarily discursive.1 In an intelligible sequence from prototype to reception, one looks not simply for a comparison but for a dialectical relation; antiquity, modernity and I would like to thank the editor, Prof. Wolfgang Haase, for his many invaluable comments, suggestions and bibliographical references. 1. The reception theory of Hans Robert Jauss (Asthetische Erfahrung und Literarische Hermeneutik, Uni-Taschenbiicher 692 [Munich: W. Fink, 1977]) and Wolfgang Iser (Der Akt des Lesens: Theorie Asthetischer Wirkung, Uni-Taschenbiicher 636 [Munich: W. Fink, 1976]) and the reader- response criticism of Stanley Fish (Is There a Text in This Class? The Authority of Interpretive Com- munities [Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1980]) developed as a strand of literary criticism and concerns itself primarily with the readers' actualization of the text. Reception theory is not as readily applied to the visual arts although this approach is favoured in, for example, A. Richard Turner, Inventing Leonardo (New York: Knopf, distributed by Random House, 1993) and Mieke Bal, Quoting Caravaggio: Contemporary Art, Preposterous History (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999), and with reference to ancient sculpture in Richard Brilliant, My Laocoin: Alternative Claims in the Interpretation of Artworks, Discovery Series 8 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2000) (reviewed in this journal by Bernard Andreae: International Journal of the Classical Tradition 7 [12000/1]: 605-607). A reception theory of the visual aesthetic is outlined in Wolfgang Kemp, 'The Work of Art and its Beholder: The Rosemary Barrow, Department of Classics, King's College, University of London, Strand, London WC2R 2LS, United Kingdom.

Just as meaning is not fixed but subject to changing inter- pretation by successive generations of viewers, so 'antiquity' itself is not a stable entity but an endlessly contested point of reference, a subject of shifting perceptions, and a var- iously constructed fragment or whole. Archaeology, collection, display, academic schol- arship and artistic appropriation all shape the way ancient art is received and perceived by the viewer today. My purpose here is to trace the artistic appropriation of one ancient form-the sculptural female nude-with two complementary questions in mind: how can this particular subject inform our understanding of the way ancient art is re-imagined, re-created, re-interpreted? and how can such receptions lead us to new or renewed read- ings of antiquity itself? This paper seeks to address these questions via an examination of a series of art works from different art historical periods and perspectives. The selection of transhistorical examples is supported by reception theorists' refusal to privilege one given reception circumstance over another, whereby the characteristics of past and pre- sent re-imaginings, re-creations and re-interpretations are both valued objects of investi- gation in themselves and tools in the quest for meanings of antiquity itself. A central focus of this article is one of the most notable twentieth-century re-creators, Giorgio de Chirico (1888--1978), who was born in Greece to Italian parents, spent his childhood and youth in Athens, studied art in Munich and as a young man lived in Milan and Florence before arriving in Paris in 1911. As his biography links him topographically to the two most esteemed classical cultures and to the nation that invented classical scholarship in its modemrn form, de Chirico is an apt choice to begin an exploration of the classical tradition. Around 1911, under the influence of Nietzsche and Schopenhauer and the two philosophers' preoccupations with differing levels of reality, de Chirico embarked on a series of paintings which he termed Metaphysical. Later in life he would describe meta- physics as something [A]I di lii delle cose fisiche: guardando certi oggetti e anche pensando, appaiono delle forze, degli aspetti e delle prospettive che noi comunemente conosciamo, quindi questo procura al pittore che ha il dono o la specialitfi di sentire e vendere queste cose "al di lii delle cosefisiche" di immaginarsi un soggetto che pub essere un soggetto che si vede nel- I'interno di una camera oppure di Piazza d'Italia come quelle che si vedono a Torino.2 beyond physical things: as we look at certain objects, and even as we think, there appear forms, objects and perspectives which we commonly know, and this causes the painter who has the gift or the speciality of feeling and seeing these things "beyond physical things" to imagine a subject which may be a sub- ject that we see in the interior of a room or in great Italian squares like those which one sees in Turin. His paintings of this period are melancholy, silent and immobile; they display deserted architectonic spaces, solitary figures and mysterious shadows.

Architecture and object carry symbolic meanings and address questions of space, time and identity, recalling the interrogation of reality associated with the theories of both Schopenhauer and Nietszche.3 Not least, de Chirico's quest points to the relationship between past and present, and, in so doing, raises significant questions concerning the nature and purpose of the classical tradition. One Metaphysical painting, The Uncertainty of the Poet [Figure 1], is a striking image that presents us with a conceptual and perceptual challenge: an ancient statue situated in the modern world. Antiquity is signalled by a sculpture and modernity by a steam train and a bunch of bananas. Placed in an illogical alignment, the statue's significance as an 3. From 1908 to 1914 de Chirico's philosophical interest centred around his discovery of the work of Nietzsche and then of Schopenhauer.

Freudian notions of dreams as revelations of the unconscious were unknown to de Chirico in his Metaphysical period, and his own interpretation of contesting levels of reality derives from nineteenth-century German philosophy; however, his oneiric im- agery was to have an impact on Freudian-influenced Surrealist painting in which free as- sociation of objects sustains a dream-like reality and the objects themselves are depicted as symbols of unconscious thought.6 De Chirico, indeed, presents us with images that function within the configurations of Freudian and post-Freudian psychoanalytic theory in which the dream, the uncon- scious and the conscious, the irrational and the rational, are all of active relevance to the understanding of meaning and the individual. Although rarely read in psychoanalytical terms at all, de Chirico's works (I propose) can profit from a Lacanian interpretation in particular.7 In Lacanian terms, the fragmented body is a concept linked with identity formation, indeed, 'the coming into being (le devenir)' of the subject itself, during the (Milano: P.

In other works of the same period, de Chirico offers similarly surprising assortments of ob- jects: in The Song of Love (1914), the head of the Apollo Belvedere rests next to a rubber glove, and in The Philosopher's Promenade (1913), a Hellenistic-type head of Zeus shares its space with two artichokes. The notion that de Chirico's placement of high-art ancient sculptures along- side everyday objects confers upon antiquity a banality which charges it with new meanings is posited by Paolo Baldacci, 'Le classicisme chez Giorgio de Chirico', Cahiers du Muste National d'Art Moderne, Paris, no. 11, 1983: 18-31, esp.: 27-28. It is suggested by Michael R. Taylor, 'Be- tween modernism and mythology: Giorgio de Chirico and the Ariadne series' in: Michael R. Taylor, ed., Giorgio de Chirico and the Myth of Ariadne (London: Merril; Philadelphia: in associa- tion with the Philadelphia Museum of Art, 2002): 35, that the origin of these strange juxtaposi- tions can be found in Cdzanne's Still Life with Plaster Cupid (c. 1895). 5. Conversely, Keala Jewell, The Art of Enigma: ch.4, argues that de Chirico's classicism functions as a form of continuity between modern Italy and its cultural heritage. Her discussion, how- ever, does not engage with the artist's representation of ancient statuary and instead concen- trates on images of heroic masculinity including mythological and gladiatorial subjects. 6. Andrd Breton's First Surrealist Manifesto (1924) cited de Chirico among others as a forerunner of Surrealism.

Baldacci, De Chirico: The Metaphysical Period 1888-1919 (above, n. 3): 132-33, does, however, offer an interesting Freudian reading of the connection between de Chirico's melancholy and interior space.</page><page sequence="5">348 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / Winter 2005 mirror stage of child development.s In the mirror stage, the infant between the ages of six and eighteen months comes to recognize its own reflection in the mirror as a whole. But this perception is in fact a misrecognition in conflict with the actual infant's body, which is 'still in a state of powerlessness and motor incoordination'-not a unified body, but one in bits-and-pieces.9 The reflection thus provides a coherence that the subject itself lacks-it is an ideal image-and the child's identification with it is a conflicted one: in the image is the apprehension of both its self and the other, and, crucially, of itself as other. Defined as it is through self-alienation, the Lacanian subject is one threatened by the memory of its prior fragmentation, which manifests itself in 'images of castration, emas- culation, mutilation, dismemberment, dislocation, evisceration, devouring, bursting open of the body'"0--images which haunt the developed human imagination. In a more general sense, Lacan's fragmented body points not only to the physical body in its fragmented state, but to any form of fragmentation and disunity:'He [the sub- ject] is originally an inchoate collection of desires-there you have the true sense of the expressionfragmented body.'11 De Chirico's damaged torso, a symbol of a fragmented an- tiquity, can thus be seen as signifying not only the place of the ancient in the modern, but also a fragmented modem identity.12 At the same time, this torso functions as a particu- larly potent image of antiquity, in that it can be seen to derive from a more or less specific ancient source. Although damaged, it is still recognizable as a variant of the standing female nude, a sculptural type which originated in the fourth century BCE. Before continuing with a discussion of de Chirico's painting as an expression of the di- alogue between antiquity and modernity, it will be useful to examine the cultural trajectory of the female nude from classical Greece onwards. The first recorded free-standing sculp- ture of the female nude is Praxiteles's Aphrodite of Cnidos [Figure 2],13 produced around 8.

Aphrodite of Cnidos (Roman copy of a fourth-century BCE original, Vatican Museum, Rome). the late 360s BCE as a cult statue, set up in the temple to the goddess at Cnidos and wor- shipped as Aphrodite Euploia (Aphrodite of the 'fair voyage'). Both de Chirico's frag- mented statue and the Cnidia have the same idealized body type of small high breasts and elongated torso, but while the Cnidia's body forms an elegant contrapposto, de Chirico ex- aggerates the swaying movement to produce an awkward twist and an ugly bulge at the waist. The resulting protrusion of belly and buttocks recall the realistic traditions of bodily representation of early modernism, and the reworked Cnidia fragment is not only placed literally within a modemrnist urban setting but formally within a modernist aesthetic. Praxiteles's sculpture, arguably the most famous of all antique statues, as attested by a series of epigrams and descriptions by ancient authors, is preserved only in Roman copies.14 Many of these copies, like de Chirico's torso, are fragmentary, or, as in the case of the Vatican copy illustrated here, restored.

In this version, at least, the pose is ambiguous. Although motivated by the mythical voyage of Aphrodite across the Mediterranean, stopping to wash the sea foam from her body, it shows the goddess un- dressing for a bath or else dressing after the bath is over. Her right hand moves to conceal her body and her left hand holds a garment. Is she dropping her garment or is she reach- ing for it to cover herself? The gesture of the hand covering the pubis is known as the pudica pose. Often inter- preted as a sign of modesty, it is the subject of contemporary academic debate. For Nanette Salomon it offers a narrative of female sexual vulnerability whereby the viewer is automatically positioned as voyeur,1s while Andrew Stewart sees the protective hand as placed casually and ineffectively, thus prompting a reading not of submission but of invitation and inclusion.'6 In support of his argument, Stewart notes the powerful sexu- ality which the goddess embodies in the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite; nevertheless, view- ing the Cnidia as a goddess, and, more specifically, as a cult statue, serves to problema- tize the question of the pose further. An image of a divine being placed in a religious context cannot be assumed to be readable in terms of normal gender relations. Fou- cauldian and socio-historical discussions of ancient art warn against interpreting erotic imagery as a modern sexual construction;17 likewise, current Western separations of reli- gious, civic and sexual life cannot be used as a framework for understanding ancient Greek interactions between art, religion and sexuality. From the archaic period, temple sculpture, conceived and displayed in the civic-reli- gious sphere, serves a public function. The aesthetic appeal of art works which look to satisfy personal taste becomes more marked from the Classical to Hellenistic periods, even though public commissions remain within the realm of religious service.

In ritualistic terms, divine nudity can signify fertility and fecundity, and exposure of the female genitals, like the male equivalent, arguably implies an apotropaic function.19 The Cnidia's nudity (despite or because of her ambiguous pose) may offer a trajectory of power and magic which operates within both the public and the private sphere; at the same time, the sexualized nature of the statue remains without question. In antiquity, textual references confirm that the original Cnidia was conceived as an erotic representation of the goddess of sexual love. Numerous descriptions draw atten- tion to her nudity as an indication of erotic allure. In the first century CE, Pliny famously records: ferunt amore captum quendam, cum delituisset noctu, simulacro cohaesisse, eiusque cupiditatis esse indicem maculam, 20 a story that a man once fell in love with it and, hiding [in the temple] by night, embraced it, and that a stain betrays this lustful act. The same anecdote appears in the Erotes, ascribed to, but doubtless later than, Lucian (second century CE). The relevant passage is part of a dialogue on the merits of woman- love versus boy-love. Two friends--Charicles, a Corinthian who prefers women, and Callicratidas, an Athenian whose preference is for boys-visit the shrine at Cnidos. There they admire the statue from their different erotic vantage points. At the back of the statue, they notice a stain on her thigh, high up between the back of her legs, and are told by a temple attendant about a young man who, enamoured of the Aphrodite, contrived to be locked into the temple at night. Like Pliny's young man, overcome with sexual desire, he attempts to consummate his love and ejaculates on the statue's marble surface.21 The place of the stain problematizes the issue of woman-love versus boy-love: pene- tration of the Aphrodite, a woman (or rather goddess), is attempted as if she were male. 18. For many art historians/classical archaeologists, the link between Greek art and religion is im- plicit.

Larissa Bonfante, 'Nudity as costume in classical art', American Journal of Archaeology 93 (1989): 543-70, argues that the exposure of female breasts and/or genitals in divine iconography op- erates in terms of magic and offers protection from evil. Catherine Johns, Sex or Symbol (above, n. 17): 72, notes that, although the female genitals are rarely represented in plastic form in Greek and Roman culture, when the vulva is depicted, like the phallus, it could be seen to con- note power and good luck. 20.

Should this impi- ous homage, this profanatory reverence, be accounted to the love of women, or of boys?'22 For our purposes, the fact that the two texts allude to the Cnidian Aphrodite's erotic potential (of whatever preference) over four hundred years after she was sculpted affirms not only her reputation but her continuing status as object of desire. In their re- cent conspectus of classical art, Mary Beard and John Henderson point out the sexual na- ture of this desire: [the] connoisseur is professionally obliged to stare long and hard right between the legs of a goddess-the cost (for some it would be the pay-off) of a proper appraisal of any statue of Venus.23 Following the Cnidia's success, the life-size standing female nude becomes a recog- nizable genre in ancient art. Numerous Roman statues-the Medici Venus, the Capitoline Venus, the Celestial Venus, the Aphrodite of the Troad, as well as half-draped Aphrodites from Arles and Capua-are copies of Greek originals, all variants on the Cnidia type.24 The Medici Venus [Figure 3] is a typical example. The pose is rearranged and the con- tours closed, with one hand moving up to conceal, or highlight, the breasts. Meanwhile the functional reason for Aphrodite's nudity-the bath motif-is removed, as all bathing accoutrements (water jar and falling drapery) are now missing. In a modem art-historical perspective, the Medici Venus has an intricate history all of her own. There is no record of the site or date of her discovery, and she is first recorded in seventeenth-century Rome in the Villa Medici. When moved to the Tribuna of the Uffizi in Florence, she was set up as one of half-a-dozen antique statues which were deemed to be the finest to have survived from antiquity. A Greek inscription on the base reads, 'Cleomenes, son of Apollodorus, from Athens', and, on the strength of this, she was pre- sumed to be Greek. In the eighteenth century, the authenticity of the signature was ques- tioned as part of an attempt to ascribe the statue to one or other of the well-known Greek sculptors of the classical age: Phidias, Scopas or Praxiteles himself. For Winckelmann, the Medici Venus was the female equivalent of the Apollo Belvedere, the ideal male nude. But by the nineteenth century, it was suggested that the Venus was a Roman copy of a Greek original; as a consequence, eulogies on her beauty were no longer forthcoming. Today, it is generally agreed that the 'Cleomenes' of the 22. Michel Foucault, The History of Sexuality 3, Care of Self, trans.

In a characteristic development the modem world looks back to this ancient tradi- tion with a series of imitations of the Cnidia, or at least of her Roman variants. In the high-art traditions of the Italian Renaissance, countless paintings of the standing female nude reproduce the body type, proportions and position of the Cnidia and her successors in accordance with the traditions of utilizing Greco-Roman sculpture as an inspirational and imitative tool. Known through monuments which survived the Middle Ages and pieces which resurfaced during the rebuilding of Rome in the fifteenth and sixteenth cen- turies, ancient sculpture was collected, displayed and disseminated through casts and 25.

Display was an essential component of col- lection: Julius II's Belvedere sculpture court was constructed behind the Vatican palace in 1503 to display a collection which included the Apollo Belvedere and the Laocoon. It was enlarged by subsequent popes, and the Vatican Cnidia had entered the collection by 1536.27 Rediscovered in a fragmentary state, statues were often routinely restored (a com- mon practice until the beginning of the nineteenth century) and thus entered Renaissance visual culture in both an incomplete and completed form. Fragmentation was a guaran- tee of authenticity and thus value, while restoration aimed to recapture aesthetic qualities which the fragment was deemed to possess as a whole. As Leonard Barkan's study of the discourses surrounding the Renaissance rediscovery and reception of ancient statuary points out, the appropriation and adaption of antique fragments including additions to and remodellings of the original, artists' sketches, and quotations within other works fix the shape and identification of the 'restored' piece.28 The interpretative acts of restoration and appropriation offer useful commentaries on the reception of the classical in Renais- sance culture and inevitably inform the appearance and identity of the antique for succes- sive generations. For the painter, sculptural quotations are most often represented in a complete state. Recognizable statues appear replicated in their sculptural shape while oth- ers are translated into 'flesh' in the form of the painted representation of the human body. Although the Venetian classical revival lacked the major monuments and the papal collections of Rome, the Greco-Roman sculptural legacy is still apparent in painterly mode.29 Among much else, the Cnidia's pudica pose is appropriated into the reclining nude tradition of the sixteenth-century Venetian school. Venus's hand rests gently on her genitals in Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c.1509: Gemildegalerie, Dresden), while in Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538: Uffizi Gallery, Florence), her fingers curl enticingly around the area she purports to cover. The reception of this ambiguous pose raises as many questions as the pose of the Cnidia herself. For Nikolaus Himmelmann, it is an uncontroversial em- 26.

It shows a half-length portrait of a standing woman posed in imitation of the Medici Venus.32 Like the Venus', this woman's hands both cover and draw atten- tion to her body. The right hand conceals the left breast while revealing the right. As with the Cnidia and her enigmatic pose, the motive for the movement is ambiguous: is she covering her body in the garment, or is she about to let it fall? Her antecedents iden- tify her as a 'Venus in Furs' over three hundred years before the eponymous founder of masochism, Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, coined the phrase in 1870 for the title of his notorious novel.33 The Renaissance tradition of sourcing mythico-religious prototypes for the depiction of the female nude raises new interpretative questions concerning paintings' subjects. Titian's Venus of Urbino is a case in point. This reclining nude in an Italian interior setting has an ambivalent identity: is she goddess or woman, contemporary courtesan or mytho- logical symbol? She is identified in the sixteenth century as 'la donna nuda' by the paint- ing's first owner, Guidobaldo della Rovere, Duke of Urbino, and as 'una Venere giovanetta' by Giorgio Vasari. Modern critics confirm or contest these identifications.34 Nevertheless, there is agreement that, in general, mythological subject matter sanctions erotic represen- tation within a system of court patronage where images are on public display.35 In a sim- ilar way, classical sculpture offers an aesthetic prototype for representation of the sensual nude. Antique statuary combines with studies of the live model to produce classicizing 30.

The female nude transcends conventional art-historical catego- rization to assume a reputation as a symbol of the classical tradition in art and, indeed, of art itself.36 Appropriations of the Cnidia in the form of paintings of the nude Venus have a special currency: they promise a unity of the aesthetic and the erotic.37 But what about the reproduction of actual ancient statuary in painting? It may indeed signal an erotic function.

Titian, Worship of Venus (1518-1520: Prado, Madrid). In Titian's Worship of Venus [Figure 5], a recognizable variant of the Cnidia type ap- pears in the right-hand corner of the canvas. Here the pudica pose takes the form of a hand clutching at drapery which slips down the hips to reveal the body. This modified pose recalls the Celestial Venus type, a Cnidia variant also known via numerous Roman copies.38 But Titian does not copy a specific prototype; he draws on and develops an an- cient tradition with his own high-Renaissance variations. The face is not in the idealized style of pre-Hellenistic sculpture, but sharply individualized. This Venus holds a shell- like bowl in her outstretched right hand, a motif which may allude to Aphrodite's birth from the foam and journey on a scallop shell.

Titian's Worship of Venus was one of two works he painted for Duke Alfonso d'Este that derived from an ecphrasis in Philostratus's Imagines. The text was chosen by the duke (or his advisors), and the completed work was placed in a camerino in his castle, which was eventually adorned with paintings by Bellini, Dosso Dossi and Titian himself.39 In the Imagines, Philostratus offers an elaborate description of a set of paintings that form the collection of a wealthy and discerning patron, all housed in a villa near Naples. In the nineteenth century scholars began to question the existence of Philostratus's gallery, and it is now widely assumed to be fictional.4 Titian's Worship of Venus competes with and actualizes Philostratus's description: it is a real painting derived from a description of an imaginary one. For Titian's patron, meanwhile, the actualizing of the Imagines is calcu- lated to identify himself with Philostratus's collector (fictional or not) and to claim for himself and his artist parity with their ancient counterparts.41 Philostratus begins, 'See, Cupids are gathering apples'.42 Accordingly, Titian offers his viewer a confusion of cupids gathering their apples, all tumbling, fighting, dancing, frol- icking. The scene is presided over by the statue of Venus. In Philostratus, it is the goddess herself who oversees the celebrations in her honour: 'Please, look at Aphrodite'.43 Here, though, she is represented in the form of a cult statue.44 Like the Cnidia, Titian's Venus does have a religious function, but whereas Philostratus asks us to look at the goddess in her shrine, Titian represents her in the form of a sacred image, on a marble podium above her worshippers. The Cnidia herself stood originally within a temple building of Doric rotunda type, a focal point within the social organization of the polis, where she was placed on a large marble base, as the conspicuous centre of the community's religious ritual.4 Titian offers no sense of the communality of Greek religious ritual as such, but a strong sense of its an- thropomorphic presence-or, strictly, a strong sense of this presence as mediated through the Greco-Roman literary-visual tradition. Titian, his patron and his audiences could all assume such an assured knowledge of ancient anthropomorphic imagery that a standing 39. Alfonso d'Este commissioned a painting on the same subject by Fra Bartolommeo in 1517, but the artist died in the same year after only completing a preparatory sketch. Titian secured the commission the following year, and his instructions would probably have included Fra Bartolommeo's sketch and Philostratus's text. Goffen, Titian's Women (above, n. 32): 108, sug- gests that the text was accessed via an Italian translation owned by Isabella d'Este, Alfonso's sister (see, Goffen, n. 11 on the Renaissance transmission of the text). 40.

The erotic is sited in the Renaissance appropriation of ancient art via a Pygmalion- type transformation of marble to painted flesh. In the Worship of Venus, it is the 'real' women, the two nymphs, described by Philostratus as 'mothers of the cupids'46 who offer an erotic charge to the painting. The nymph holding a mirror (a votive offering to the goddess) also derives from a sculptural prototype-neo-Attic maenad relief sculp- ture47-but here she is rendered voluptuously as moving, living flesh.48 The sculptural Venus, by contrast, points to the religiosity of the cult statue and does not offer a sexual- ized presence, albeit in a painting of eroticized subject and title. From the Renaissance onwards, artists continue to operate within a broadly com- parable structure of visual certainties, and, from Botticelli to Matisse, painters draw on the viewer's familiarity with the female nude in the tradition of the Cnidian Aphrodite. Aesthetic and art-historical discourses surrounding the nude Venus, in particular, offer cul- tural authority to her representation. Both imitations of and reactions against her tradi- tional form (painted and sculptural) and its attendant associations, confirm her continuing presence within western art practice. By the nineteenth century, the continuum of ancient statuary offered a set of pre- existing artistic paradigms for painters in Europe, Britain and America. Accordingly, sculpture forms a compelling prototype for the representation of the Greco-Roman mytho- logical nude, while actual statues, architecture and other artefacts appear in many paint- ings of Roman life. A fashion for Roman history and historical genre painting was facili- tated by new archaeological discoveries revealing the domestic world of Pompeii and Herculaneum.49 Scenes cluttered with archaeological paraphernalia reveal an ancient past narrativized in the form of the compilation and visualization of 'authentic' detail. Yet alongside Romano-Pompeian settings and accessories, artists still adhere to the forms of Greco-Roman art familiar from the Renaissance onwards. So strong are the codes of 46.

The Roman sites of Pompeii and Herculaneum were first rediscovered in the middle of the eigh- teenth century and their finds were to influence Neoclassical art, architecture and decoration. By the middle of the nineteenth century, new archaeological method focusing on systematic exca- vation and cataloguing of finds, centred around the same sites. During the 1850s French Nio- Grec painters introduced precise archaeological settings inspired by finds from Pompeii and Herculaneum into genre scenes of Roman life and by the next decade British artists began to pro- duce comparable images.

In the right-hand comrner of Alma-Tadema's Catullus Reading his Poems at Lesbia's House [Figure 6], the Medici Venus, a marble statue of over life size, is portrayed as a sil- ver statuette. Alma-Tadema, however, has removed the statue from any religious context. Doubly displaced, the statue, in art-historical terms a high status piece, is transformed into a mere table decoration. One notes that such a small-scale reproduction would have been familiar to a nineteenth-century audience: the Venus was mass-produced as a small bronze domestic ornament, much as the Cnidia type was reproduced in statuette form in the Roman world. In metal reproductions, the support, an integral part of the marble original, was excluded as unnecessary. Here, intriguingly, the Venus's lower legs are ob- scured, resolving (or evading) the problem of the support. Fig. 6.

Not only is the statue reduced in size; it is transformed from marble to silver. In the ancient world, and specifically the imperial Roman world, a silver statuette has a significance greater than the merely decorative. Pliny tells us: 'It is not only for quantities of silver that there is such a rage among mankind but there is almost more violent passion for works of fine handicraft' (Nec copia argenti tantum furit vita, sed valdius paene manipretiis).50 Like many Victorian painters of the an- 50.

A standing Catullus declaims his poetry to a reclining Lesbia and two seated men. Within a witty, urbane and carefree construct of Catullus's Rome, his love poems portray Lesbia as a cultured and wealthy individual. Here her house is a richly decorated Pompeian-type interior, cluttered with expensive gold and silver plate and statuary, all of which serves to emphasize Lesbia's wealth and status. Pliny's tart comment on the appeal of silver suggests that the collect- ing of art works and decorative items had more to do with the Roman elite's public dis- play of wealth and acquisition than with discernment and taste. In this spirit, Alma- Tadema places Lesbia and her circle among Pliny's wealthy Roman collectors who acquired works of art purely for the value and status of their material. In the 1860s and '70s, when Catullus Reading his Poems at Lesbia's House was com- pleted, Alma-Tadema produced a number of paintings depicting wealthy Romans giving private viewings of choice pieces from their own collections, including A Roman Art Lover (1868: Glasgow Museum and Art Gallery). In an extravagant atrium supported by huge green Cippolino columns with gilded Ionic capitals, a man reclines on a couch while his three guests gaze rapturously at a silver statue of a girl frightened by a snake copied from a marble original in the Capitoline Museum, Rome. The first of Alma-Tadema's connois- seur paintings to be publicly exhibited, A Roman Art Lover excited much critical response. The art critic F. G. Stephens described the painting as a meditation on decadence: Greek civilisation had culminated, was swallowed by the greedy Romans, and Rome herself was decaying when the time arrived for the quiet satire of our artist upon her dilettantism.53 Stephens went on to describe the faces of the assembled connoisseurs, in which he dis- cerned 'more than [a] touch of Horatian satire'. The reference to Horace calls to mind Satire 1.4, in which the poet describes the vices of the crowd: 'One loves the glitter of sil- ver; Albius stares at bronze' (hunc capit argenti splendor, stupet Albius aere).,4 Stephens has highlighted a possible point of reference for the painting, but similar sentiments can be 51. Over his lifetime Alma-Tadema accumulated a vast reference collection of over five thousand photographs and four thousand books. His private library consisted mostly of classical texts and translations and classical-archaeological publications by modem authorities, listed in: Alma- Tadema Library: Hand List of Books (Heslop Room, Main Library, University of Birmingham). 52. Such an antiquity evinces a popular Victorian construction of Rome which itself looks back to Edward Gibbon's eighteenth-century classic, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Em- pire. Gibbon forged a connection between material prosperity and the demise of empire and, in doing so, delineated a Rome of luxurious indolence.

In one extreme example, Petronius's boorish freedman, Trimalchio, displays silver plate to his dinner guests with the weight of silver inscribed upon it.55 The standing Venus in Alma-Tadema's Catullus, then, points to an alternative read- ing of Roman culture in that we are directed to an underside of late Republican or early imperial culture. At the same time, we must remember that this is a painting of a poet and his mistress. An image of the goddess of love, no doubt, seems a conventional choice in a painting showing two lovers. More than this, though, the choice of the Medici Venus, a standing female nude derived from the Cnidia, provides an extra layer of meaning: the Cnidia was purportedly modelled on Praxiteles's mistress, the hetaera Phryne.56 The fic- tional Lesbia, though not a hetaera, was a woman who preferred her lovers to be rich and numerous.57 The diagrammatic relationships between poet, sculptor and two mistresses lend a suitably sexual frisson to a scene already laden with significant archaeological im- agery although, as in Titian's Worship of Venus, the statue acts as an erotic signal rather than an erotic presence. Alma-Tadema's layers of meaning presuppose a measure of knowledge and cer- tainty about the Greco-Roman artistic continuum and the visuality of the ancient world. By the early twentieth century no such certainties could be assumed. Classicism, in the form of a high-art tradition in direct descent from the Renaissance, had effectively come to an end. While modern artists incorporate classical motifs and allusions in their works, the notion of an exemplary antiquity-and with it, any notion of a sculptural ideal-has become outmoded. In 1920 Ezra Pound sums up the classical heritage in ten words: 'two gross of broken statues..,. a few thousand battered books.'" One such broken statue, of course, is represented by de Chirico in The Uncertainty of the Poet. De Chirico has recognizably drawn on the classical tradition, but he has not merely transposed his statue, and decontextualized her: he has also made her abstract and remote from any continuous meaning-whether functionally religious (as in Praxite- les's original Cnidia), residually religious and erotic (as with Titian's frolicking cupids), or socio-historical (as with Alma-Tadema's other side of Rome). The fragment is seen as central to the modernist sensibility, its modes of experience and their artistic expression. David Frisby sees the modem city as engendering frag- ment consciousness."9 Linda Nochlin, too, identifies an aesthetics of fragmentation in modernist painting from the 1870s onwards-cropped compositions, cut-offs, composi- tions with fragmented figures-as a reflection of the fluidity of modem urban life.6 Here we cannot but be aware of the pace of urban existence as a steam train hurtles past in the background. At the same time, the statue's awkward pose (as already noted) enables her 55. Petronius, Satyricon: 15.31. 56. Athenaeus, 13.590, 591A; cf. Athenaeus, 13.591B, Pausanias, 1.20.1-2, 9.27.3-5. 57.

Neverthe- less, despite its modernist characteristics, this torso remains a potent symbol of antiquity which sits uneasily in its modemrn setting. The juxtaposition of torso, steam train and bananas is startling and unsettling. Above all, it is the torso's fragmentary state which seems to confound any hope of certainty about the look of the ancient world or any prospect of continuity with it. The very title, 'the uncertainty of the poet', points to the problematic of art and inspiration in the modern world: the formal and spiritual relation- ships of a conventional classical tradition, like the statue itself, are broken. Additionally, in Lacanian terms, as we have seen, the 'fragmented body' of the statue points to the un- certainties of modern identity, of which the relationship between ancient and modemrn can be taken as representative. Indeed, the painting confronts us with multiple uncertainties. The surface of the original Cnidia was finely polished Parian marble. De Chirico makes no attempt to rep- resent a polished marble surface; instead, the figure is harshly outlined in black, while the stippled texture recalls the technique of drawing from antique casts-a major compo- nent of nineteenth-century art education. The German-born British artist, Hubert von Herkomer, remembered the laborious process at Southampton Art School in the 1860s: 'stipple, stipple, stipple night after night, for six or perhaps nine months, at one piece of ornament something under fourteen inches long.'61 De Chirico himself recalled the five- year art programme at Athens Polytechnic: 'there were four years of drawing and study- ing black and white from prints and sculpture before working directly from a living model.' ("Al Politecnio di Atene sifacevano quattro anni di disegno e di studio del bianco e nero da stampe e da sculture, prima di lavorare direttamente da un modello vivo")62 This torso, then, need not derive from a Roman variant of the Cnidia-type or a Roman copy of a Greek original; it may represent a modern cast of a Roman copy of a Greek original. The way the modem world views antiquity thus becomes doubly distanced.63 Its viewing habits are remote from those of the participating believer; they approximate to those of the curi- ous voyeur in so far as distance itself is one of the predicating factors of the voyeuristic scenario, and nowhere more than when the object of the viewing is the embodied female form. Kenneth Clark's study of the nude in western art begins with an examination of Greco-Roman statuary. He acknowledges the sensual function of the original Cnidia but maintains that she is an ideal creation who embodies 'a harmonious calm, a gentleness even, much at variance with the amatory epigrams which she inspired.'6 Feminist art historians have challenged Clark's assumptions about male viewership and about the aesthetic transformation of the body from naked to nude and have argued instead that the female nude can be understood in terms of the containment of female sexuality 61.

They point out that de Chirico's representations of classical statuary were often copied from book illustrations thus emphasizing both a sense of unreality and a distance from the past. 64.

At the same time, the mod- ern labelling of sculptures of the female nude as Venuses-the Medici Venus, the Venus of Milo (Melos) and so on-gives modem viewers an alibi of religion for their voyeurism.66 De Chirico takes away that alibi. His statue derives from the Cnidia type but she is given no identity; she is not a particular Venus, and as such fails to gain respectability and be authorized by the classical tradition. In copies of the Cnidia, the figure turns her head slightly away from or towards the spectator, depending on the angle from which she is viewed. The original would probably have been coloured: gilded details, tinted body and painted eyes. The Cnidia's painted gaze would have both confronted and avoided that of the viewer, as if in acknowledge- ment of the complications of any viewing of such a figure, especially a viewing by a male viewer in a male-dominated world. A field of vision in which looking is an erotic activity associated with the male as subject and the female as object has been most extensively ex- plored in feminist film theory, which draws on psychoanalytic thought. Laura Mulvey's seminal article 'Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema' submits this set of relationships to a hugely influential characterization: Kaja Silverman, amongst others, has noted that Mulvey's intervention 'demonstrates the impossibility of thinking about any part of the classic cinematic organization-including editing-apart from sexual difference.'67 Mulvey's famous catechism is as follows: In a world ordered by sexual imbalance, pleasure in looking has been split be- tween active/male and passive/female. The determining male gaze projects its phantasy onto the female figure, which is styled accordingly. In their traditional exhibitionist role women are simultaneously looked at and displayed, with their appearance coded for strong visual and erotic impact so that they can be said to connote to-be-looked-at-ness.6 Subsequent work has demonstrated how Mulvey's deployment of Lacanian theory was imprecise: what she designates as the 'determining male gaze' is in fact what Lacan calls 'the eye,' and what contemporary feminist film theory now calls 'the look'. The gaze in Lacan pre-exists the eye-'I see only from one point, but in my existence I am looked at 66. This idea was first discussed in: Beard and Henderson, Classical Art (above, n. 23): 115. 67.

Laura Mulvey, 'Visual pleasure and narrative cinema', Screen, no. 16:3 (1975): 6-18, M A. Mulvey's article analyzes the spectator-screen relationship in terms of the (passive) woman as recipient of the (active) male gaze, a necessary corollary of which is the 'masculinization' of the spectator's position regardless of gender. Film theory subsequently begins to contest her Lacanian premise that the text constructs the subject, and Mulvey discusses the problematizing of such a position in 'Afterthoughts on "visual pleasure and narrative cinema" inspired by King Vidor's Duel in the Sun', Framework, no. 15-17, (Summer 1981): 12-15. The construction of a masculinized spectator- ship is now often discarded in favour of the notion of an audience's ability to subvert the film's dominant reading.

This is the function that is found at the heart of the institution of the subject in the visible. What determines me, at the most profound level, in the visible, is the gaze that is outside'.69 The gaze cannot be considered coterminous with any individual viewer; it is on the side of the object, it always exceeds the subject and his look. It is the look and not the gaze, then, that is emplaced 'within spectacle, the body, temporality, and desire,'70 within the viewing sce- narios of classical cinema that are Mulvey's concern. But this does not invalidate the real insights Mulvey has made about the gendered implications of the three looks in cinema- the camera at the players, the players in the diegesis, the spectator at the screen. In her ac- count, the pleasurable looks in classical cinema are constructed on the male's perception of the woman as castrated and offer two corollaries for disavowing her missing phallus and neutralizing the potential threat of her image: voyeurism, which figures women as objects of investigation and is pursued through narrative; and fetishism, which images and overinvests parts or the whole of her body with erotic significance, and is thus on the side of spectacle. It is the latter of these that is important for de Chirico's Cnidia. The arching body of de Chirico's statue moves towards the viewer and yet, unlike the original Cnidia, she has herself no look to be met. Without a head, she can only connote 'to-be-looked-at-ness': the unseeing, unthinking torso becomes the ultimate fetishized female body. The Cnidia, with head and painted eyes, had the power to confront the viewer's look. This fragmented torso rather points to the problematic of voyeurism: we, the latter-day viewers, can never achieve the vantage point of the ancient viewer- participant, and are instead presented starkly with all the uncertainties of desire. The body of a nude Venus is to the modern world a symbol, alienated even beyond an object, of eroticism. Next to the torso, de Chirico has placed a bunch of bananas. Bananas have a multi- plicity of connotations: modern, mercantile, comic, phallic. Common in Europe only after importation from the Caribbean, they became a fact of European life around 1900, and in de Chirico's painting they function as symbols of a modemrn world. Bananas quickly en- tered the repertoire of the comic, and 'have a banana' becomes a catchphrase in British music-hall routines from the beginning of the twentieth century.71 Their phallic shape also places bananas in the realm of the erotic, and a phallic symbol placed next to a female nude would seem, on one level, an unsurprising juxtaposition. But these bananas 69.

Just so, we remember that the young man described by Pliny and Lucian, like the soft bananas, failed to couple with the statue and instead left semen stains on its thigh. Cowling and Mundy suggest that the bananas evoke the sensual plea- sures of life in contrast to the lifeless torso and the intellectual legacy it symbolizes.72 Far removed from the original Cnidia's form and function, de Chirico's torso, then, offers in- tellectual rather than sexual meaning. De Chirico's female nude reveals much about the place of the classics in the modern world. But what, if anything, does it reveal about 'antiquity' in general and the Greek world, in which Praxiteles sculpted the Cnidia, in particular? To us, art works, located in private collections and public museums, are objects long venerated, and, in essence, iso- lated from popular experience. Here, in a bare confrontation of a torso and a bunch of ba- nanas, modem eyes see a harsh contrast between the hallowed and the banal, the sub- lime and the ridiculous. But is de Chirico perhaps also divining something of the original function and meaning of ancient statuary? Greek sculpture was positioned publicly and stood therefore in dialogue with the everyday."73 Greek sculpture was not impossibly ele- vated but tangible; so tangible that Pliny and Lucian, like de Chirico, could similarly jux- tapose the sublime and the ridiculous in their anecdote of the young man, and his failed attempt to consummate his love for Praxiteles's Aphrodite of Cnidos. A seeming modem parallel to these ancient authors is found in James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. Joyce writes: You say that art must not excite desire. I told you that one day I wrote my name with a pencil on the backside of the Venus of Praxiteles in the Museum. Was that not desire. [?]74 The answer expected in the text, however, is no. Stephen Daedalus, to whom the question is addressed, responds: 'You also told me that when you were a boy in that charming Carmelite school you ate pieces of cowdung'. Like eating cowdung, writing one's name on an art object in a museum, and on a part of that object which itself has multiple sexual connotations, is sticking two fingers up at the sanctity of tradition: the action is youthful rebellion, not desire. Praxiteles's Aphrodite of Cnidos, and likewise any sculptural image which derives from her, is no longer an integral part of communal life. It is not positioned in the civic-religious public sphere, accessible to all, but in a museum, the province of the cultured, the educated, the disinterestedly interested, alone. And plainly, Joyce's action is a reaction against all that culture, education and disinterested interest. As if in tacit dialogue with his literary-modernist contemporary, de Chirico takes Aphrodite/Venus out of the museum and places her in the popular arena once again. 72.

For example, Aristophanes's peasant hero, Strepsiades, is presented in intimate conversation with the statue of Hermes at his doorstep (Clouds, 1478 ff.); a marble statue of Heracles by the fourth-century sculptor, Scopas, stood in the gymnasium near the market-place at Sicyon (Pausanias, 2.10.1); as a boy the athlete Theagenes was so attracted to the bronze statue of a god in the market-place at Thasos that he placed it on his shoulders and carried it home (Pausanias, 6.11.2-3).

The sets of objects tease us with the question: what is the place, the function, the meaning of the antique past in the mod- ern world? At the same time, the painting confronts us with the modern world's urgent interrogations of the concept of desire. For Lacan, desire is a paramount concern of psy- choanalysis and at the centre of human existence. His prime concern is unconscious desire which he sees as being entirely sexual and, as 'man's desire is the desire of the Other',75 it is something which is characteristically mobilized by lack. The object-which represents the lacking or the lost-must and will always escape the subject; and thus, unlike a demand or a need which can be satisfied, the realization of desire does not consist in being fulfilled; it is constant and eternal. I suggest that we can make an illuminating comparison with human desire for a sculpture of a goddess which, as Pliny and Lucian inform us, was incapable of being fulfilled. De Chirico's torso points to the intellectualizing of desire. Just as Lacan judges every object of desire to be ephemeral (it is incapable of stopping the lack in the subject), so the Cnidia and her many variations and copies eventually lose their originary signification, which was both religious and erotic. Just as the phallic bananas will fail to make an impact on the unyielding material of the torso, so the modern gaze fails to penetrate Aphrodite's de- sirability. Even when situated in a notionally public space evocative of its original func- tion and meaning, an image of ancient art will remain, for the modern viewer, actively elusive. From Praxiteles to Pliny to Joyce, Aphrodite's sculptural form is in one obvious sense a constant, in another something constantly changing. Beneath this constant and this change, however, it is desire, its motives and manifestations, which impinge as fundamental agencies. From the fourth century BCE to the twentieth century CE, we can observe the female sculptural nude of the Cnidia type in her many incarnations. The original Cnidia had what a modern sensibility is instructed to perceive as a holistic, religious-erotic signifi- cance. In a Christian world, a pagan deity loses its participatory religious significance, but the sculptural form of the goddess of love continues to offer erotic meanings. Yet the frustration of any truly participatory erotic experience now only intensifies these mean- ings in their secondary encirclement of her image as a symbol rather than an object of desire. Carlo Carri, a contemporary of de Chirico and fellow Metaphysical painter, described his own understanding of the classical tradition in terms of the use of the ancient for the creation of the new: Changeons en notre miel les plus antiques fleurs; Pour peindre notre idle empruntons leur couleurs; Allumons nosflambeaux si leursfeux podtiques; Sur des pensers nouveauxfaisons des vers antiques. 75.

Titian's Worship of Venus, Alma-Tadema's Catullus Reading his Poems at Lesbia's House and de Chirico's The Uncertainty of the Poet point to aspects of antiquity-religiosity and the cult statue, the other side of Rome, the communal function of Greek art-the meanings and lost presences of which are of immediate concern to today's readers and viewers of the ancient world. In their different ways, the same three images all present a commentary on the place of the ancient within the modemrn and serve to reconstitute the meaning of 'the ancient'- and thereby, per contra, the meaning of 'the modern'.
