<plain_text><page sequence="1">Going Rogue: Spenser and the Vagrants by Evan Gurney Edmund Spenser's poetry is teeming with rogues -false beggars, vagabonds , and other figures of similar disrepute- but his work is rarely discussed in the context of Tudor vagrancy law or rogue literature. This article situates Spenser's persistent interest in rogues throughout his career among contemporary debates over vagrancy, examining its role and function in his allegorical poetics. Spenser is attracted to these figures, I argue, precisely on account of the characteristics that earned them the opprobrium of so many Elizabethans : their associations with idleness and disguise ; as well as their skill- ful capacity for complicating moments or sites of interpretive difficulty by way of rheto- ric or simulation. Whereas vagrants frustrated Tudor authorities who desired clear and stable markers distinguishing the deserving poor from sturdy beggars, the rogue offered Spenser a compelling figure of hermeneutic instability, an allegorical personage dra- matizing the perils of reading. In fact, vagrants often appear in Spenser's work in the context of rhetoric or poetry, which lends his own verse a sense of complicity with these popular criminals, as if Spenser acknowledges that the poet is a close cousin of (and per- haps fellow cozener with) the rogue.

The first two professions are con- sciously archaic in post-Reformation England- pilgrimages and men- dicant friars had largely gone out, of course, though it was conventional in Protestant propaganda to associate vagrancy with Roman Catholi- cism2- but Spenser brings the list up to date with his second pair of references. Linked by more than alliteration, the terms "Gipsen" (or counterfeit Egyptian) and "Iuggler" were recent Tudor additions to the official criminal lexicon. Juggling had long been associated with delin- quent behavior on account of its use of legerdemain, but it does not make its way into the statutory books until the Act of 1572, the same year the term "rogue" gains legal purchase, when "all Juglers Pedlars Tynkers and Petye Chapmen, [who] shalle wander abroade, and have not License of two Justices of the Peace" are classified as vagrants.3 Gyp- sies, who likely arrived in England sometime in the early sixteenth cen- tury, had become a criminal category several decades earlier, in the 1530s, and the Elizabethan statute of 1563, one of the crueler acts of legislation on historical record, equates a gypsy identity with criminal status: merely being a gypsy, or dressing like one, or even associating with gypsies was considered a felony offense.4 More generally, how- ever, Spenser uses both terms to stand in here as bywords for a broad class of Tudor criminals who supposedly preyed on- or, to use another newly coined word that Spenser deploys in the poem, 'cozened'- an 1 Yale Edition of the Shorter Poems of Edmund Spenser, ed.

It is worth mentioning that the second half of the poem's title, Prosopopoia, means counterfeit im- personation. Spenser's gesture toward recent statutory proscriptions against gyp- sies and jugglers is no coincidence but instead a specific instance of a larger pattern in which, as Andrew Zürcher has observed, Mother Hub- berds Tale adopts "the language of government and social control."5 The Fox and Ape are clearly aware of recent developments in vagrancy law, for example, knowing better than "wildly to wander in the worlds eye / Without passport or good warrantye, / For feare least we like rogues should be reputed / And for eare marked beasts abroad be bruted" (185-88). These lines demonstrate a keen familiarity with contemporary legislation: scholars, theatrical players, and other itinerant tradesmen needed a passport to travel long distances without suspicion, and beg- gars needed a license to beg locally or they would be apprehended by authorities and marked as vagrants, literally earmarked by being, as the 1572 statute dictates, "whipped and burnt through the gristle of the right eare with a hot Yron." Nor are these fears unwarranted. At the poem's conclusion, when the Fox and Ape are discovered and apprehended, the Fox is "uncased," that is, unclothed and likely flayed or whipped, and the Ape's ears are cut off. These are not the standard punishments doled out for theft or murder or treason, all of which they have committed, but rather for vagrancy. There is a sense, then, that every subsequent crime is merely an extension of this first decision to circumvent Eliza- bethan statutes against vagabonds, when the Fox and Ape forge beg- gar's licenses and fashion themselves as wounded soldiers late from the wars. Here too the pair demonstrate a savvy appreciation for contempo- rary policies related to vagrancy, since wounded veterans, "that now is thought a civile begging sect" (198), were afforded more mobility and legal sanction to beg for alms, although counterfeit soldiers received in- creased scrutiny from the Privy Council by the late 1580s.6 In their new capacity as disguised members of the deserving poor, they immediately trick a well-intentioned farmer, the "simple husbandman," and repay his charity by killing his entire flock of sheep. A scene of menace and confusion, the episode sets the tone for everything that follows. 5 Zürcher, Spenser's Legal Language : Law and Poetry in Early Modern England (Cam- bridge: D. S.

She even suggests that Spenser, as an alert and often misleading fabulist, might be modeling his own poetic behavior after the Fox.7 Aside from her study, however, most of the critical attention that links the Fox and Ape to vagrancy is either limited in scope, briefly referencing the contemporary social issue be- fore moving on to other concerns, or limited by the prevailing scholarly orthodoxies of an earlier era, which took for granted the historical accu- racy of rogue pamphlets.8 Aside from Patterson, and to a certain ex- tent Kent van den Berg and Richard Danson Brown, surprisingly little scholarship has closely examined the relationship of roguery and va- grancy in Mother Hubberds Tale to Spenser's art and practice.9 In fact, Spenser is rarely if ever mentioned in the broader context of rogue literature and vagrancy law.10 Literary scholarship that engages 7 Patterson, "Still Reading Spenser after All These Years?" ELR 25 (1995): 432-44. In many ways Patterson's article is the start to this one; several of her shrewd asides seemed worth exploring in more detail. Patterson also studies the roguish behavior of the Fox and Ape in her study of the Aesopian tradition, Fables of Power: Aesopian Writing and Political History (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1991), 64-67. 8 As an example of this descriptive tendency, see The Spenser Encyclopedia , ed. A. C. Hamilton (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1990), which simply notes that the Fox and Ape "set out as vagrants to improve their fortunes" (184). As for the critical posture toward vagrancy among an earlier generation of Spenser scholars, consider Milligan's claim in "The Counterfeit Soldier in Mother Hubberd's Tale": "There seems no reason to doubt Spenser's very accurate knowledge of the rogue conditions described by such real- istic observers as Awdeley and Harman" (422). 9 Van den Berg studies Spenser's ambivalent appropriation of prosopopoia as both a vehicle for the Fox's "counterfeit reality" as well as a crucial poetic resource in "'The Counterfeit in Personation': Spenser's Prosopopoia, or Mother Hubberds Tale," in The Au- thor in His Work, ed. Louis Martz and Aubrey Williams (New Haven, CT: Yale Univer- sity Press, 1978), 85-102; Brown, who likens the pair of rogues to Robert Greene's coney- catchers, develops Patterson's suggestion by considering the Fox and Ape as models for a kind of amoral poetics, in The New Poet: Novelty and Tradition in Spenser's Complaints (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 1999), 169-212.

Craig Dionne and Steve Mentz (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2006), 312-36. Although the essay is notable for including Spenser in a discussion of contemporary rogue literature, Stafford never mentions or examines the fact that Spenser himself engages the issue of Irish rogues in the</page><page sequence="5">550 Spenser and the Vagrants vagrancy and rogues has largely focused on Elizabethan and Jaco- bean prose and drama, for good reason, given the inclusion of theatri- cal players in the early vagrancy statutes, the histrionic skill associated with roguery and beggary, and the emergence of rogue pamphlets as a popular genre in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Consequently, however, we have a great deal more to say about rogues and William Shakespeare or Ben Jonson or Thomas Nashe, let alone Robert Greene or Thomas Dekker, than we do about Spenser or Philip Sidney or, to a lesser extent, John Donne. But as a civil official, a seri- ous and committed humanist, an informed religious and social critic, and a shrewd participant in the emerging literary marketplace, Spenser engages most of the professional and intellectual contexts in which va- grancy was passionately disputed or dramatized. Spenser returns to the figure of the vagrant throughout his career, and in fascinating ways. In the "May" eclogue of The Shepheardes Cal- ender, for example, Piers twice refers to irresponsible shepherds (or priests) as "faytours," an archaic epithet likely borrowed from William Langland that the poem's anonymous commentator E. K. glosses as "vagabond" and a temi specifically associated with vagrants who feigned illness while begging -often the "falling sickness" or epilepsy. (These earned the term "counterfeit cranks" in Thomas Harman's tax- onomy.) Later Spenser recycles the term throughout The Faerie Queene to depict false identities of various kinds, particularly when describing the arch-hypocrite Archimago. Diggon Davie, in "September," worries about the roguish fraud and disguise of wolves whose "craft is in their countenaunce" (168). In book 5 of The Faerie Queene, Malengin, in addi- tion to being associated with juggling and legerdemain, is depicted as an angler or hooker, a specific type of rogue with a long hook described in pamphlet literature.11 Spenser's portrayal of the brigands in book 6 as a "lawless people" (6.10.39) likely refers to the native Irish, but their be- havior and government, their organized disorder, would have sounded familiar to readers of rogue pamphlets, as would have the sexual pro- miscuity of the Satyrs in book 3, who treat Hellenore, much like rogues treat their doxies in Harman, as a "commune good" (3.10.36). In almost each of these instances, vagrancy is at once accidental, a vehicle to an- other thematic issue of relevance for Spenser, whether he is dramatiz- treatise, when Irenius outlines a proposal that would forcibly remove vagrants from the Irish countryside. 11 See Milligan, "Spenser's Malengin and the Rogue-Book Hooker/' Philological Quar- terly 19 (1940): 147-48.</page><page sequence="6">Evan Gurney 551 ing the apparent perils of Roman Catholicism or the barbarous incivility he considers characteristic of the native Irish and Old English, and also essential, insofar as rogues and vagrants present themselves as em- bodied texts that are obscure and misinterpretable. Spenser's interest in the figure is a continuation of a lifelong preoccupation with the prob- lems of reading and hermeneutics. This article will situate Spenser's use of the vagrant or rogue figure- in Mother Hubberds Tale and throughout his career- among contempo- rary debates over vagrancy, examining its role and function in his alle- gorical poetics and exploring potential reasons why vagrants remain such a persistent interest throughout his career. Beggars, sturdy or otherwise, Elizabethan or not, passive recipients of relief or dynamic agents negotiating the conditions of poverty, have often been reflexive markers that reveal the habits of mind and behavior attendant to the cultures in which they wander or reside. In this case, a close study of the context and manner in which Spenser deploys the figure of the vagrant reveals a sensitive if ambivalent posture, one that registers several typi- cal social and literary anxieties related to roguery (and dismisses others) but remains equally compelled by its fictive potential. This essay argues that Spenser is attracted to vagrants precisely on account of the charac- teristics that made them disreputable among so many contemporary Elizabethans: their associations with idleness and disguise, as well as their skillful capacity for complicating moments or sites of interpre- tive difficulty by way of rhetoric or simulation. Moreover, the vagrant, as a figure in whom bodies and clothes and papers converge in a tex- tual economy fraught with dubious meanings, offers Spenser a useful metaphor that can stand in for similar interpretive ruptures in his own poetic work. Indeed, although he takes care to distinguish his civiliz- ing project from roguish schemes, even if we need to take his word for it, Spenser seems to acknowledge that his literary product relies on what might be called a vagrant poetics, which likewise wanders in the world's eye, which purposely obscures its designs in "a darke conceit" (737), which always dramatizes the perils of interpretation and error, which often begs for a charitable reading, and which is sometimes re- buffed by "Stoické censours" (4.proem.3). * * * If Mother Hubberds Tale was indeed composed "in the raw conceipt of [Spenser's] youth" (334) and later revised for publication with the rest</page><page sequence="7">552 Spenser and the Vagrants of his Complaints in 1591, it is hardly surprising to find references to vagrants and rogues. The poem's likely period of initial composition, the 1570s, witnessed an intense nationwide discussion of potential re- forms to mitigate poverty, and a choir of indignant voices railed against vagrancy and roguery in particular. Suddenly these otherwise marginal figures were at the center of intellectual conversation. In addition to the statutory poor laws of 1572 and 1576, as well as local municipal poli- cies attempting to categorize and relieve the poor, vagrants appeared in religious polemic, homilies, plays, and chronicles. They emerged in the 1560s as antiheroes in a new genre of popular pamphlet, rogue lit- erature such as John Awdeley's Fraternity of Vagabonds (ca. 1561) and Thomas Harman's Caueat or warening, for common cursetors (1566), which envisioned an organized criminal network of vagrants who spoke their own language or cant. Comic caricatures of vagabonds were found in jest books, which were especially popular among academic circles- we know, for example, that during this decade Spenser loaned Gabriel Harvey his own copies of Howleglas and Scoggins J estes, as well as a re- cent translation of the picaresque work by Lazarillo de Tormes.12 Spital sermons exhorted almsgivers to perform works of charity, and though some clerics reminded their audience to "be mercifull to the poore indif- ferentlye, without respect of persons . . . Though some do make an occu- pation of it," others urged givers to beware of vagrants or "bold beggers that in Stangate hole take mens horses by the heads," an admonition that would become more pronounced among clergy later in the cen- tury.13 Religious reformers employed the vagrant as figurative evidence of disorder in the church, comparing nonresident clergy who owned multiple benefices to vagrants, presumably because they, like rogues and vagabonds, were not attached to a specific parish church. Moralists, social critics, and humanists treated the sturdy beggar as symptoms of social and political disorder, excoriating the good intentions of men and women who encourage these "caterpillars in the commonwealth" who "doo but licke the sweat from the true laborers browes," as William Harrison puts it in 1577 (note, for future reference, that Stephen Gos- son recycles this phrase two years later to describe poets in The School 12 Virginia Stern, Gabriel Harvey: His Life, Marginalia , and Library (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1979), 49.

The second reference to vagrants, a quotation from Thomas Drant's A fruitfull and necessary sermon, specially concernyng almes geuing ([London, 1572], Aviii), is perhaps all the more remark- able on account of Drant's otherwise strict adherence to indiscriminate almsgiving.</page><page sequence="8">Evan Gurney 553 of Abuse, linking these two disreputable professions).14 English writers continued to examine the problem of rogues, with varying points of emphasis, throughout the rest of the century, so the focus on vagrancy in Mother Hubberds Tale- indeed, its essential role in driving the satiri- cal narrative- would have remained current, and, given the popularity of coneycatching pamphlets that shortly followed Spenser's Complaints, fashionable among the literate public in 1591. Although there is considerable overlap, two distinct threads emerge in this larger cultural fixation on vagrancy, one focused on legal and ad- ministrative policies related to the poor and another that participates in a venerable (if jocular) literary tradition of depicting vagabonds. In the wake of the English Reformation's dissolution of monasteries and other Roman Catholic institutions, Tudor governments, at both local and na- tional levels, replaced traditional forms of charitable giving by devel- oping alternative systems of discriminate poor relief.15 The process was clumsy to begin with, and the transition was further exacerbated by a population increase and economic stagnation, as well as intermittent but devastating plagues and harvest failures. Beggars swarmed the land, or so it appeared, overwhelming local resources and heightening suspicions that the able-bodied poor were managing to "bereave the godly poor of that which is due unto them . . . consuming the charity of well disposed people."16 By the early 1570s it was clear to authorities that poor relief required additional reform, and much of the focus of statutes in 1572 and 1576 was aimed at reducing the apparent increase in fraudulent appropriations of charitable alms. Historians continue to debate the actual lived conditions of vagrancy during the Tudor period, but it is clear that the sixteenth-century notion of the criminal vagrant or English rogue- as opposed to, say, the more general class of itiner- ant poor- was equally shaped by literary sources like the Liber Vaga- torum (ca. 1509), Alexander Barclay's Ship of Fools (1509), itself based on Sebastian Brant's Narrenschiff ( 1494), Simon Fish's Supplication for the 14 Harrison, The Description of England, ed.

Although English governments had legislated against vagrancy since at least 1348 in an effort to limit the mobility of the poor, statutes be- came more comprehensive and were more often enforced in the early sixteenth century, part of a larger effort to promote greater efficiency and regularity in the distribution of charitable alms. Much of the new Tudor machinery of material charity instituted widespread categoriza- tion of the poor, which required a thorough interrogation by local au- thorities to ensure that each recipient of aid actually belonged among the deserving poor. The vagrant, as the alternative identity imposed on those denied the official status of pauper, thus became inextricably linked to poor relief. Moreover, by virtue of the period's paradoxical logic of charity, idealized as a marriage of righteous discipline and mer- ciful aid, authorities insisted "that increased penalties for vagabonds were an act of charity, a necessary concomitant to increased poor relief," which the title of the 1572 legislation announces by way of conjunction: Acte for the Punishment of Vagabonds and for the Relief of the Poor and Impo- tent }9 Any beggar who was legitimately unable to work was provided relief, while anyone healthy enough to perform labor- often disregard- ing whether work was actually available- was classified as a vagrant and punished. And the punitive measures intended to discourage and punish vagrancy were severe, a kind of Tudor three-strikes law gradu- 17 See Woodbridge ( Vagrancy ) for what is perhaps the most thorough and convincing literary genealogy of rogue literature. 18 For evidence that rogue literature indeed influenced statutory language, see Kathleen Pories, " The Intersection of Poor Laws and Literature in the Sixteenth Century: Fictional and Factual Categories/' in Framing Elizabethan Fictions: Contemporary Approaches to Early Modern Narrative Prose, ed.

Meanwhile, anyone giving alms or shelter to a vagrant was fined, a point worth emphasizing: in the legal economy of Elizabethan England, Spenser's well-intentioned farmer reaps what he sows by giving charity to criminals. (He is "a good yeoman" but also "a simple husbandman," suggesting that his fault is a lack of acuity.) Others, however, were in- dicted for their "vaine pitie," as Thomas Elyot calls it, which induces vagrants "to thefte and robry, and some tyme to murdre, to the in- quietation of good men."20 There is evidence that municipal authori- ties rarely invoked this specific prong of vagrancy law, but the implica- tions of penalizing charity loom large. Fining charitable donors served as one legislative response to the anxious fascination among all Eliza- bethans with vagrants who leveraged the pity or fear of individuals to beg and steal for a living, burdening givers with increased hermeneu- tic responsibility. The earlier 1547 vagrancy act, for example, indicts the "foolish mercy and pity" of people who enable these so-called crimi- nals, suggesting that donors are complicit in the fraud. It seems odd that the penalties for interpretive error were so rigorous, given the persis- tent admission among Elizabethans, one implicitly corroborated in law, that correctly reading the poor was an incredibly difficult task. Con- temporaries seemed to recognize that the exchange of gifts involved a fragile dynamic prone to misapplication or exploitation, but by fining people who mistakenly gave money or shelter to vagrants- by solv- ing the problem that way- authorities only heightened the interpre- tive burden for donors. For anybody who felt morally obligated to offer charity to strangers, the stakes had been raised, transforming the itiner- ant poor into a site of hermeneutic tension that must have been appar- ent to Spenser and others. This insistence on establishing an official hermeneutics of poverty is perhaps the most characteristic feature of sixteenth-century develop- ments in poor relief. The impoverished and destitute were examined and interrogated, provided begging licenses or passports if circum- stances dictated, their conditions registered and written down by local Collectors of the Poor, who would "without fraud or partiality" gather and distribute the charitable monies received from local parishioners, giving "a just account thereof in writing" to parish authorities. Notice, 20 Elyot, The Boke named the Governour (London, 1531), Q51".</page><page sequence="11">556 Spenser and the Vagrants in this idealized depiction of poor relief policy (largely paraphrased from Archbishop Grindal's injunctions of 1571), how much reading and interpretation is required; in fact, much of what we know about this pro- cess stems from the written records of Collectors or churchwardens.21 On a more conceptual level, as part of their efforts to control the grow- ing threat of vagrancy, authorities attempted to stabilize the population by instituting a variety of "semiotic schemes," to borrow William C. Carroll's term, such as badging or licensing -to positively distinguish the worthy beggars- and branding, earmarking, or imprisoning of- fenders, thus marking fraudulent beggars permanently, attempting to regain "control of the signifying systems"; for beggars who faked an ill- ness or disability, meanwhile, "the state could make real what had only been feigned, writing the true text of pain over the counterfeit one."22 In addition to this gradation of punishments was the standard procedure of sending each vagrant back to his or her resident parish, where the individual's identity and circumstances were presumably on record, al- though local authorities would typically escort offenders only to their own county's boundaries, whereupon the vagrants would again dis- appear from official view. In the legal landscape of charitable giving, vagrants would suddenly appear in obscurity, force a fretful reading of identity and circumstance, and then disappear once more, with or with- out additional legal marking to aid future officers. These policies suggest that the real trouble posed by vagrants was, perhaps, their inscrutability, to Elizabethans in general and to official- dom in particular, which undermined the fixed categories on which these nascent systems of aid (or social control, depending on one's per- spective) relied. Indeed, the statute of 1598 essentially banned begging altogether, trying to remedy what was clearly an intractable problem, although this measure, according to one anonymous commentator, merely displaced from laypeople to officials an impossible task: "To in- quire after poore is the next way to procure poore: for . . . many will dissemble their estates to have releefe, if you doe but examine their estates."23 As Patricia Fumerton notes, citing a well-known letter from Somerset magistrate Edward Hext to Lord Burghley, "What is unnerv- ing ... for contemporaries as well as cultural historians, is the inability to distinguish between the invisible rogue and the invisible itinerant 21 Mcintosh, Poor Relief in England, 1350-1600, 255-69. 22 Carroll, Fat King, Lean Beggar: Representations of Poverty in the Age of Shakespeare (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1996), 44-46. 23 An Ease for Overseers (London, 1601), 29.</page><page sequence="12">Evan Gurney 557 poor/'24 In other words, it was difficult to tell one poor person from another, and in trying to stabilize the hermeneutic dilemma by way of licenses and passports, which were easily forged or misappropri- ated, or by permanently writing a criminal identity onto the so-called rogue's body with a brand or scourge, authorities merely ensured that vagrant bodies and vagrant texts merged into a complex problem of reading. This phenomenon worried contemporaries even as it offered them a touchstone for other interpretive pressures. Tobias Hug has observed that the Elizabethan language of imposture and counterfeit identity seems to spring up in this period of renewed interest in beg- gary, marking "a change in the ways of how deception and pretence were described," and Barry Taylor notes that the discourse of vagrancy (and theatricality more generally) forced contemporaries into the un- comfortable realization that "knowledge of social agents and relations . . . involves a hazardous labour of interpretation."25 The vagrant and his reputed capacity for persuasion and disguise became, then, a kind of métonymie stand-in for a larger cultural anxiety about the instability of language and unreliability of appearance. If contemporary policies related to vagrancy acknowledge that the bodies of impoverished persons were misinterpretable texts, difficult to read and difficult to keep stationary, many texts about vagrants contra- dict this posture, confidently asserting a range of behaviors endemic to the population. In this particular discourse of vagrancy- the liter- ary account of sturdy beggars, I mean- several general characteristics emerge that are worth highlighting on account of their relevance to Spenser's own depiction of vagrants and rogues. Perhaps most promi- nent was the assumption that vagrants were predisposed to idleness, which was, beyond its own intrinsic viciousness, linked to sedition, Jesuitical papism (that "rabble of vagrant runagates"26), and wasteful- ness, all of which produced a general anxiety among authorities that was exacerbated during periods of dearth.

Vagrants were also viewed with skepticism on ac- count of their mobility, which transgressed geographical, social, linguis- tic, and even professional boundaries during a period when authorities clearly desired stability. Because of this mobility, perhaps, the itinerant poor had conferred on them a kind of alien status (reinforced by the widespread belief that they spoke in cant), as when Thomas Wilson, in defending the measures to repress vagrancy in the 1572 Act, claims that "it was no charity to give to such a one as we know not," and the authors of the Second Admonition explicitly give precedence to the ma- terial needs of religious refugees from the Continent before "the other swine."27 This mindset reached its logical terminus when the 1598 Poor Law initiated the process of legal deportation for crimes of vagrancy. Likewise, it was assumed that vagrants were sexually licentious, "a promiscuous generation" as one cleric later puts it, gathering in empty barns and other sites for orgiastic gatherings.28 These accusations were often inflected by bestial metaphors- the "Roguish Travelling people, which in their Common Whoredome, resemble lawlesse Beastes"29- and in other contexts vagrants were compared to drones, wasps, rabbits, and, if we read Spenser closely, foxes and apes. Although sixteenth- century writers often deployed zoomorphic categories to depict vari- ous social or professional estates (priests as foxes, lawyers as wolves, et cetera), these particular classifications emphasize a lack of reason, order, and restraint. When Spenser's Ape worries about being "bruted abroad" as "an ear marked beast," his chosen verb captures both the literal and figurative impacts of vagrant discourse: the cropped ears would announce (or brute) to strangers his criminal identity even as they would signal his subhuman status. Additional ironies emerge in Spenser's poem, since the fable's final punishment serves as a blithe eti- ology explaining why apes look so much like men, a correspondence that will actually facilitate more future impersonations.30 * * * 27 Wilson is quoted in Slack, Poverty and Policy, 125.

If Aesopian fables possess a kind of etiological economy, here Spenser provides an origin story of vagrant identity, linking the motivation to leave one's residence with the age-old dictum that "where change is, good may gotten bee" (101). He dramatizes this scene without evident moral judgment, and Spenser's own career, it should be noted, was characterized by constant mobility, from London and Cambridge to his various secretarial posts in England and Ireland and finally to County Cork, and he often articulates, like the Fox, a simi- lar sense of disappointment in "still wayting preferment up to clime" (76). He lends the episode further texture by riffing on an apparently popular desire among Elizabethans, memorialized in ballads like "The Cunning Northern Beggar" or plays like Nashe's Summer's Last Will and Testament , for the supposed freedoms associated with the merry life of beggary: "Such will we fashion both our selues to bee, / Lords of the world, and so will wander free / Where so us listeth, uncontrol'd of anie" (167-69). The poem is clearly fascinated with the topic of begging and informed about its contemporary legal and social status, while the final episode of the poem corroborates William Fulke's observation, in A Brief and Plain Declaration , that sturdy beggars are often "practicers of great matters against the state."31 By staging this peculiar anxiety of the Elizabethan authorities, Spenser's satire acquires a sharp ironic edge, since he is obviously more concerned with the influence of individu- als like Lord Burghley or Archbishop Loftus than any threat to the state posed by actual beggars.32 Another typical feature of roguery likewise glances at the cultural elite in Spenser's poem, as the Fox and Ape only indulge in their sexual appetites, dallying "with courtizans, and costly riotize" (805), once they reach the court, although they demonstrate a formidable degree of glut- tony and wastefulness throughout. And, of course, the pair of rogues perpetrate fraud everywhere they go, "abusing manie through their cloaked guile" (344). They forge passports and licenses not once but 31 In Elizabethan Puritanism, ed.

But Thomas Herron has mustered considerable evidence that suggests Spenser might have targeted Loftus in his critique: see "Edmund Spenser's Mother Hub- berds Tale (1591) and Adam Loftus, Archbishop of Dublin and Lord Chancellor of Ireland/' Studies in Philology 105 (2008): 336-87.</page><page sequence="15">560 Spenser and the Vagrants twice. References to their subtlety, their legerdemain, and their disguise abound throughout the poem, leading Harry Berger, Jr. to go so far as to classify them as different sides of the same bad coin: "The fox is men- tal cunning, the ape physical cunning [sic]."33 In addition to their tem- porary careers as false shepherds, priests, and courtiers, the pair adopt more traditional roles of rogue literature: the Ape is a juggler, a fortune teller, a gamester, and a pander; the Fox is a huckster or peddler, as well as a counterfeit lawyer, merchant, broker, and farmer. Their counter- feit impersonations give poetic life to one of the great fears embedded within the legal discourse of vagrancy- these wandering strangers could be anybody- and by manipulating his identity the Fox, in particu- lar, takes advantage of the good faith that governs fair exchange. The poem's Chaucerian features are clearly evident in this beast fable cum estates satire, as are vestiges of the Reynard cycle and classical epic, but Mother Hubberds Tale is a true satura lanx, one that includes rogue lit- erature and picaresque elements among its overflowing generic platter. Despite its supposed archaic style and language, then, Mother Hub- berds Tale translates contemporary prose tracts of rogue literature, as well as the legal statutes and other treatises focused on vagrancy, into vivid poetry centered on an issue of critical social moment. And its re- ception suggests the work was a literary and political sensation, win- ning fame and infamy in equal parts, though the facts are murky as to why it was called in from circulation. Sir Thomas Tresham, recount- ing the fallout to an acquaintance, notes that Spenser quickly morphed from poet laurel to poet lorrell, but the barb may be more apt than he in- tended, since Cock Lorrell was a mythic prince of rogues, celebrated in Awdeley as well as Samuel Rid's Martin Markall, Beadle of Bridewell, and it could be argued that Spenser (rather than Greene) inaugurated a sec- ond generation of rogue literature in the 1590s.34 A year after the publi- cation of Spenser's Complaints, Nashe embedded in Pierce Pennilesse an incisive political fable involving the wiles of a fox, and Lamilia's fable, in Greenes Groats-worth of Wit, features a counterfeiting fox to figure forth "the falshoode of make-shift flatterers." Later, likely written in 1607 but not published until 1627, Richard Niccols's The Begger's Ape recycles a great deal of Spenser's theme and plot, and similar forms of satirical beast fable continued to emerge throughout the seventeenth century, culminating in John Dryden's The Hind and the Panther. Moreover, many 33 Berger, "The Prospect of the Imagination/' SEL 1 (1961): 106. 34 Andrew Hadheld, Edmund Spenser: A Life (Oxford: Oxford university rress, 2012), 267.</page><page sequence="16">Evan Gurney 561 of the title pages of Robert Greene's coneycatching works, in addition to that of Harman's The groundworke of conny-catching, show illustrations of anthropomorphic rabbits, clearly playing on the term "coney" but like- wise revealing the influence of Spenser's beast fable. The resemblances are compelling, and if we set aside certain generic criteria, it might be worth asking whether Mother Hubberds Tale quali- fies as a work of rogue literature. But it is equally fruitful to examine crucial differences between Spenser's poetry and the work of writers like Copland, Walker, Harman, or even Greene and Dekker. Whereas rogue literature famously parades as a journalistic account of the crimi- nal underground, inserting a variety of literary stereotypes into a con- vincing social scene, Spenser purposely distances his tale from reality by foregrounding its fictive elements, lending his own work a plausible deniability, a strategy reinforced by the volume's prefatory material.35 The implications of Spenser's posture are not merely related to cen- sorship. If Harman, and later Greene and Dekker, claim to make the practice of roguery more transparent (thereby profiting from their ex- pertise), Spenser intentionally makes the phenomenon more obscure, an even greater interpretive dilemma. And the poem's implicit answer to this problem bucks conventional wisdom: if rogue literature drama- tizes a series of encounters that illustrate the virtue of refusing alms to a beggar, Spenser reverses this moral index, marking each character by his initial response to the Fox's and Ape's requests for aid. Aside from their early affair with the simple husbandman, the roguish Fox and Ape meet more powerful and experienced rogues wherever they go, from the Priest to the Mule to a range of delinquents at court, all of whom circulate around a negligent or truant royal authority. Spenser's poem offers an inversion of the speaker's progress in George Herbert's "Re- demption," who moves from the "great resorts" of "cities, theatres, gar- dens, parks, and courts" to find Christ among the "ragged" company of "thee ves and murderers"- here we find rogues among the courtly cir- cles.36 This strategy likely reveals the influence of Lazarillo de Tormes. Al- though the poem's protagonists are less sympathetic than Lazarillo, its narrative trajectory follows a similar formula, moving from the fraudu- lent practices of the lower classes up the social ladder to the fraudulent practices of social elite. The same feature of vagrancy that accommo- 35 See Lauren Silberman, "Aesopian Prosopopoia : Making Faces and Playing Chicken in Mother Hubberds Tale," Spenser Studies: A Renaissance Poetry Annual 11 (2012): 221-47. 36 Herbert, "Redemption," in The Works of George Herbert, ed.

Contemporaries were troubled by this vagrant permeability between geographical and social boundaries, but surely Mother Hubberds Tale is most disturbing in its depiction of the moral continuities between estates. If Elizabethan officials worried about telling one poor person from another, Spenser, in blurring the boundaries of social class, makes it difficult to tell a poor rogue from a rich one. In this way the poem does not, as many rogue pamphlets do, unsettle but ultimately support a social and political order that is threatened by rogues- it simply un- settles. And the social order, Spenser shows, is already populated by vagrants of all kinds. Though he ultimately dismisses the subversive potential of rogue literature, Stephen Greenblatt deals at length with the opportunity for vagrants to be "revealed either as less fortunate and well-protected imitators of their betters, or, alternatively, as primitive rebels against the hypocrisy of a cruel society."37 In the case of Mother Hubberds Tale , Spenser seems to work both of these potential revelations into the satirical framework of his story: the Fox and Ape begin by ac- cusing a few high-born individuals of holding "all the patrimonie . . . in hugger mugger in their hand" (138-39), appropriating the rhetoric of egalitarian complaint (and anticipating the Giant of book 5), but the case is clearly altered once they ascend to power: "As for the rascall commons least he cared; / For not so common was his bountie shared" (1193-94). That the Fox and Ape indict the very estates they eventually impersonate only strengthens Spenser's critique. All is rogue: we have met the vagrants, and they are us. * * * If there is a kind of social reflexivity in Spenser's depiction of vagrancy, if rogues and priests and courtiers are all of a kind, it is most apparent in the potential kinship between false beggars and the poet himself. Although the Fox and Ape design "to liue withouten toyle" (158), idle- ness serves as an ambivalent marker of roguish behavior and poetic vocation throughout Mother Hubberds Tale , generating a complicated nexus of meanings. The tale itself, which is offered to the narrator dur- ing an illness, is called "fit for that idle stound" (26), for example, and 37 Greenblatt, Shakespearean Negotiations (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988), 5iā</page><page sequence="18">Evan Gurney 563 in his dedicatory epistle Spenser casually notes (by way of a delightful paradox) that the poem was one among several "idle labours" of his youth. More importantly, the Fox and Ape are hardly the only charac- ters in the work to deploy prosopopoia- Spenser actually highlights his own method of "simplicitie and meannesse thus personated" in the prefatory epistle -and each instance of counterfeit personage gestures at the creative but deceptive role of authorship. Just as the Fox first men- tions his desire "to disguise / in some straunge habit" (83-84), so too does Mercury (that great god of "cunning theeveries" [1287]) when he makes his epic descent to rectify the rogues' abuses, "standing by the gates in strange disguise" (1271). Mercury is more than a messenger in this case, as Kenneth John Atchity and van den Berg both make clear, serving in addition "the disquieting function in the poem as a represen- tative artist."38 Even Spenser's ideal courtier, considered by some to be a description of Sidney, seems to participate in this penchant for dis- guise and verbal invention, though his rogueries are governed by cru- cial modifiers: "Supplanted by fine falshood and faire guile; / Of all the which he gathereth, what is fit / T'enrich the storehouse of his power- full wit" (788-90, emphasis mine). A similar formula appears in Tears of the Muses, , when Thalia laments the loss of "Fine Counterfesaunce, and vnhurtfull Sport" (197). There seems to be some degree of roguish re- flexivity, then, between the lawful and unlawful, between the virtuous and the vagrant. Poets, by virtue of their feigning, had often been implicated in this kind of ambivalent tension, accused of falsehood and dissimulation, their fictive power suspected by some and feared by others. Jonson insisted on "the impossibility of any man's being the good poet with- out first being a good man"- its own self-promoting and potentially ironic utterance- but it is far less certain Spenser believed the same, given his depiction of such effective but demonic rhetors as Despair. As Trevor McNeely has pointed out, the pervasive contention that rhe- torical power is inextricably linked to moral integrity reveals a much deeper fear among writers in the period that persuasive language is in fact amoral.39 Renaissance attitudes toward allegory were particularly ambivalent, often acknowledging the mode's intrinsic deceitfulness in 38 Atchity, "Spenser's Mother HubbercTs Tale: Three Themes of Order/7 Philological Quarterly 52 (1973): 161-72; and van den Berg, "'The Counterfeit in Personation/" 95-100; the quotation, however, is from Oram, ed., Shorter Poems, 333. 39 McNeely, Proteus Unmasked: Sixteenth-Century Rhetoric and the Art of Shakespeare (Cranbury, NJ: Rosemont Publishing, 2004).</page><page sequence="19">564 Spenser and the Vagrants "speaking other/' Consider George Puttenham's description of allegory in The Arte of English Poesy ; which depicts the figure (as he calls it) as a kind of captain rogue or "chief Ringleader" among other fraudulent rhetorical devices, "which for his duplicitie we call the figure of False Semblant or Dissimulation," calling to mind the character of "Faus Semblant" in Jean de Meun's Roman de la Rose.40 Poets and rogues, it seems, share in common a predilection for simulating a verbal or physi- cal exterior in order to disguise their intentions. Vagrants even seem to work their way into manuals of poetics, as in Henry Peacham's de- scription of metaphor in The Garden of Eloquence: "He that hath seene a caterpiller eating and devouring the tender buds and blossomes of trees and plants, and after this shall see an idle person living by the spoyle of other mens labours, is put in mind to call him a caterpillar."41 In response to antagonism and suspicion, poets and rhetoricians con- structed a variety of defenses, from Sidney's blithe claim that poets "nothing affirmeth, and therefore never lieth" to Dante's emphasis on the moral utility of poetry, "a truth cloaked under a beautiful lie." Most often, however, writers would invoke the same authority as Sir John Harington, who, in the preface to his 1591 translation of Ariosto's Orlando Furioso , defends his enterprise by claiming, "And first for lying, I might if I list excuse it by the rule of Poetica licentia"42 The notion of poetic license was derived from classical dicta, articulated by Horace, Cicero, Quintilian, and others, assigning to poets a special license to de- ploy fictive matter in speech and writing. Rather than serving as a mere bulwark for poetic fiat, however, notions of license were involved in a tenuous negotiation of conflicting meanings: "the too much license of poetasters," as Jonson would have it; autonomous freedom granted to the poetic imagination; or, most pertinent to this particular essay, a kind of external control doled out by authorities to writers.43 The authority of a poetic license in this latter instance is figurative, of course, and 40 Puttenham, The Art of English Poesy, ed.

All of these licenses, textual or otherwise, were conceived in part to sta- bilize a problematic exchange- between writer or publisher and audi- ence, almsgiver and beggar, medical practitioner and sick patient- that was vulnerable to abuse and distrust. The link between licenses for poetry and poverty is not as arbitrary as it might seem. Printers them- selves were often implicated in the discourse of roguery: when George Gascoigne's printer, Richard Smith, Englished Robert Henryson's Mo- rali Fabillis of Esope in 1577, he included among the prefatory material a poem entitled "The bookes passport," which defended the publication of fables against potential slander and misinterpretation.45 Spenser, in this fabulistic and picaresque mode, finds at least one potential answer to the question in "October" posed by Piers: "O pierlesse Poesye, where is then thy place?" (79). On the road, it seems, as Spenser takes his verse begging for a good reading by using fine falsehoods. This is not to say that Spenser was actively fashioning himself as a vagrant poet, but it does seem clear that he often considered the spheres of writing and begging in tandem. In Lucifera's House of Pride, for ex- ample, when Envie is depicted as the enemy of good works, Spenser takes care to link almsgiving with poetry, the two activities perhaps most vulnerable to malicious interpretation. And if Spenser read Lang- land's Piers Plowman in a fashion similar to Kate Crassons, he would have discovered a helpful allegorical model that likewise found itself 44 Kate Giglio, "Female Orality and the Healing Arts in Spenser's Mother Hubberds Tale," in Oral Traditions and Gender in Early Modern Literary Texts, ed.

Although Crassons focuses on the C-text, whereas Spenser would have known Langland through one of Robert Crowley's editions of the B-text, her argument remains pertinent: Langland develops a sophisticated and complex poetics to dramatize the material and spiritual conditions associated with poverty, deploying allegory to obscure the transparency assumed in contempo- rary discourses of poverty (i.e., as a stable signifier of virtue or vice), essentially playing a deceptive role similar to the faytours or false beg- gars he excoriates.46 Spenser achieves a similar effect in his own alle- gorical poetics, dramatizing the complex traffic between spiritual and material conditions and complicating confessional scruples. Consider the figure of Kirkrapine in The Faerie Queene, who robs "poore mens boxes of their due reliefe, / Which given was to them for good intents" (1.3.17), a passage that has been read convincingly by scholars as an at- tack on monasticism, Presbyterianism, or the Church of England estab- lishment.47 Spenser's allegory ensures that the specific target of this piece of topical religious satire remains obscure, no matter how loaded seems that reference to a Scottish kirk. What is without doubt, on the other hand, is the dignity Spenser accords to the poor (who are "due" or entitled to relief), the worthiness of good intentions among those anonymous charitable givers, however they are inflected by theological distinctions, and how vulnerable alms are to misappropriation. Kirk- rapine himself is clearly a disreputable figure, a rogue who creeps "by cunning sleights in at the window" (1.3.17) to steal alms and vestments, but it is the intention governing his deceptive conduct that merits blame. His guile is neither foul nor fair. Spenser, meanwhile, uses his own alle- gorical cunning to slip past crude religious dichotomies into a more subtle and wide-reaching evaluation of ecclesial governance. More generally fable and allegory provide a poet with opportuni- ties to negotiate the complicated dynamics of a diverse and unreliable readership, "the daunger of envy, and suspition of present time" (737), as Spenser puts it to Ralegh. This letter, as John Pendergast has shown, might best be read as a kind of prologue, or accessus, that is meant less as a formula that will unlock the poem's allegorical content than as a "public [declaration] of literary intention," a reminder that allegory is 46 Crassons, The Claims of Poverty (Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 2010), esp. 21-88. 47 See Kathryn Walls, "Spenser's Kirkrapine and John Foxe's Attack on Rome," Notes and Queries 31 (1984): 173-75; and Mary Robert Falls, "Spenser's Kirkrapine and the Eliza- bethans," Studies in Philology 50 (1953): 457-75.</page><page sequence="22">Evan Gurney 567 a rhetorical strategy rather than a static symbolic equation, prodding the reader to look for the hidden meanings.48 The poem advertises its own disguise, calling attention to the need for sensitive interpretation, just as any beggar in Elizabethan England would have immediately re- quired close scrutiny from potential almsgivers. It is no coincidence that Spenser's descriptions of vagrants often appear in the context of poetry or rhetoric. The stereotypes of Elizabethan rogue literature provided a recognizable figure for Spenser's allegorical purposes, the vagrant as an avatar of idleness or sexual promiscuity, but he eschews these con- ventional types in favor of using vagrants to dramatize the perils of dis- guise and simulation. Whether or not they were a genuine social prob- lem-and for Spenser vagrants seem to be less a moral problem (as they were for, say, the cleric John Northbrooke49) than a hermeneutic one- the rogue provided an apt figure for a writer who wished to illus- trate the volatility of any interpretive encounter, one that is complicated by the issue of poetic and rhetorical agency. This strategy is evident in "May," a so-called moral eclogue calling for religious and moral amendment. Piers struggles to convince his inter- locutor Palinode of the need for reform, so he tells a fable, a story that involves a vagrant fox who destroys a naïve kid. The fox is a peddler- a profession notoriously difficult to distinguish from roguery- and a gifted rhetorician to boot, exploiting his verbal and histrionic powers to convince the kid of his distress. But so too is Piers, who is using his own fabulistic rhetoric to convince his audience of corruption in the Church of England, just as Spenser is performing similar rhetorical feats for his readers. It is difficult to tell, in this poem, what distinguishes the poet from the shepherd from the vagrant. The poet himself is a type of false beggar, a Protean vagrant familiar with disguises, but one who might transform the reader by way of "honest dissimulation," as Plutarch sug- gests and Sidney commends.50 The only difference is one of intention, an interior condition that is difficult to interpret reliably. Spenser wor- ries over the inherent disguises of poetry, its "powerfull wit," and often seems to solve his dilemma by anchoring its procedure to putatively good intentions, "to fashion a gentleman or noble person in vertuous and gentle discipline" (737). It is a reminder that the poet's allegory, 48 Pendergast, Religion , Allegory, and Literacy in Early Modern England, 1560-1640 (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2006), 136. 49 See Northbrooke, Spiritus est vicarius Christi in terra: A treatise wherein dicing, daunc- ing, vaine playes or enterludes (London, 1577). 50 Sidney, An Apology for Poetry, 93, referring to Plutarch's Mor alia 348d.</page><page sequence="23">568 Spenser and the Vagrants which places the reader in a position of trial, is on trial as well, relying on the same disposition among interpreters- mercy or charity- that gets the kid in trouble with the disguised fox. This reliance on charitable hermeneutics, which fuels Spenser's ap- prehension of malicious interpreters like Sclaunder or the Blatant Beast, prompts a similar concern with indifferent or unfeeling readers, Lord Burghley most prominently among them. In the proem to book 4, when Spenser ventriloquizes Burghley's criticism of "looser rimes" in The Faerie Queene and poetry in general, he includes a parodie echo of his own stated project in his letter to Ralegh: By which fraile youth is oft to follie led, Through false allurement of that pleasing baite, That better were in vertues discipled, Then with vaine poemes weeds to haue their fancies fed. (4.proem.i) This is not merely an ironic deflation of Burghley; Spenser (like Sidney before him) expresses authentic concern for the dissembling capacities of fictive speech, acknowledging the "fault of few that haue abusd the same" (4.proem.2). But he suggests that such dangers give poetry its power, that there is no better method of instilling moral discipline pre- cisely because of the pleasing allurements of poetry. Spenser refuses, moreover, to dismiss the authority of passionate language, taking care to champion the precedence of love as a guarantor of virtue. Indeed, the poet's apology for romantic verse culminates in a defense of love itself, protecting the scope and sanction of the wayward but powerful virtue as well as all its lexical and notional cousins- pity, charity, mercy, friend- ship-and bringing to mind Calvin's rejection of Stoic rationality in his commentary on De dementia.51 Burghley, Spenser suggests, begins and ends with false premises. Not only is he wrong to prefer virtue before love, "For it of honor and all vertue is / The roote," but he is unquali- fied to appraise its value anyway: "Such ones ill iudge of loue, that can- not loue" (4.proem.2-3). Put another way, Burghley is a bad reader, a "Stoické censour," participating in the same tradition as Thomas Elyot's scorn for the "vaine pitie" practiced by almsgivers, whose merciful pos- tures provided inducement to rogues like Harman's Ruffler who could ask for "charitie, rufully and lamentably, that it would make a flyntey hart to relent, and pitye his miserable estate."52 The limited hermeneutic 51 Jean Calvin, Calvin's Commentary on Seneca's De dementia, ed.

If Spenser acknowledges that poets serve as indispensable but un- reliable moral custodians, he develops and explores this paradox most fully near the conclusion of book 5, in the figure of Bon/Malfont, whose twinned identity underscores the inherent ambivalence of poetry as well as its relationship to the apparently contradicting imperatives of justice and mercy. Situated at the threshold of Mercilla's presence, pre- sumably an erstwhile apologist turned critic, Malfont stands with his tongue nailed to a post, his vagrant speech (or "trespasse" [5.9.25]) lit- erally immobilized by authorities in similar fashion to contemporary discipline of vagrant bodies. Malfonťs grotesque punishment em- bodies not only the dual capacities of poetic speech to heal and to harm but also its rival destinies, a poet laurel turned poet lorrell indeed: "but bon that once had written bin, / Was raced out, and Mai was now put in" (5.9.26). The scene captures in its description the worst kind of poetic power- its capacity for slander and abusive language- but also its vul- nerability to the troubling politics of interpretation. Although Malfonťs guilt is taken for granted by most scholars, Spenser's language itself is troublingly opaque, "the purport of his sin, / In cyphers strange, that few could rightly read" (5.9.26), suggesting that the poet might be vic- timized by a false or even malicious reading. The line separating good poets from bad, in other words, might be as much a matter of inter- pretation as it is intention. Certainly Malfonťs "lewd poems" call to mind Burghley's earlier indictment of Spenser's own "looser rimes." As Peter Herman has observed of this episode, rather than establishing clear boundaries between the virtuous and vicious, Spenser dramatizes "the porosity of the border separating use from abuse, right from wrong forms of poetry, and Spenser from the Malfonts of his poem."53 This ambiguity is reinforced by the hermetic quality of allegory itself, which remains resistant to the transparent language of power despite its at- tempts to erase Bonfont's history and former identity. Poetic speech is difficult to interpret and difficult to control, managing even in this compromised position to undermine the revised message, however "plainely to be red" (5.9.26) it appears. Interestingly, just before Artegal and Arthur are introduced to this "Poet bad," they encounter a rogue named Malengin or Guy le.

Spenser uses the staff as an emblem of devious in- genuity (malum ingenium) and, like Dekker and others, expands on the figure's associations with angling: And in his hand an huge long staffe he held, Whose top was arm'd with many an yron hooke, Fit to catch hold of all that he could weld, Or in the compasse of his douches tooke And euer round about he cast his looke. Als at his backe a great wyde net he bore, With which he seldome fished at the brooke, But vsd to fish for fooles on the dry shore, Of which he in faire weather wont to take great store. (5-9-11) Elsewhere Malengin becomes literally protean, transforming himself into a series of animals to escape the clutches of Artegall, and here his staff experiences a metamorphosis, from a walking stick to an extra ap- pendage to an angling rod and gesturing also at the poet's pen. In addi- tion to roguish angling, moreover, "he in slights and iugling feates did flow, / And of legierdemayne the mysteries did know" (5.9.13). By highlighting these associations with vagrancy, I do not mean to suggest that Spenser intends for Malengin to represent a specific type of actual rogue, as opposed to Irish rebels or Jesuit missionaries.54 In- stead Spenser deploys a recognizable social figure to illustrate cunning writ large: "For he so crafty was to forge and face, / So light of hand, and nymble of his pace, / So smooth of tongue, and subtile in his tale. / That could deceiue one looking in his face" (5.9.5). Devious in appearance, wit, language, and movement, Malengin defies even physiognomy: there is no window into his soul, no exterior marks that signify a dispo- sitional condition. Again, Spenser is worried here about the obscurity of intention. He repeats the word "intent" three times in a short space, noting how Malengin laughs to shade "his false intent," performs tricks 54 Elizabeth Heale, "Spenser's Malengine, Missionary Priests, and the Means of Jus- tice/' Review of English Studies 41 (1990): 171-84.</page><page sequence="26">Evan Gurney 571 to "turne her eyes from his intent away/' and finally pounces when she herself has "lent her intentiue mind" (5.9.13-14). He is impossible to read. In this way he is much like Bon/Malfonťs cyphers. Indeed, before the iron flail of Talus and Mercilla's iron nail, the only feature that truly seems to stabilize the identities of Malfont and Malengin is a shared prefix, but this too is only a brief kind of linguistic stasis, temporary in nature and artificially imposed. Perhaps the most interesting aspect related to Malengin is his prox- imity to Mercilla's court. Hovering on the periphery of an episode fraught with allegorical significance, Malengin initiates a parade of guile, from Malengin to Malfont to Duessa on trial. But Spenser is doing something more than merely indicting the practices of forgery and fraudulence. Arthur and Artegall practice their own deceitful method of luring Malengin into capture, after all, and Bon/Malfont is punished for accusing Mercilla of guile rather than practicing it him- self. Even Awe, an intermediary figure ostensibly guarding the physi- cal and figurative space between Malengin and Malfont, participates in this sequence as a "gyantlike resemblance, / To keepe out guyle, and malice, and despight, / That vnder shew oftimes of fayned semblance" (5.9.22). He is himself an artifact of poetic guile, his identity already at several removes- a resemblance of something like a giant- and carry- ing within its own description a counterfeit echo in the rhyme word "semblance." In dramatizing the pageantry of justice in Duessa's trial at Mercilla's court, Spenser takes care to invoke royal prerogative, the law of nations, common law, and even ecclesiastical law, but readers are left to wonder about the legibility of jurisprudence. Spenser uses the specter of roguery to generate a pervasive atmosphere of guilt, and in this case the ironic reflexivity of roguish guile points as much toward the court, where it seems to congregate, as it does the Irish landscape. It is perhaps no surprise that Spenser claims shortly after, in his proem to book 6, that courtesy at court is "nought but forgerie" (6.proem.5). Spenser's depictions of roguery and poetry place his allegorical project under a great deal of interpretive pressure as book 5 nears its conclusion. The rigor of Talus seems merely to disperse the guile of Ma- lengin in every direction, including Mercilla's court, and efforts by au- thorities to "race out" the earlier identity of Bonfont remain incomplete. A similar problem emerges in A View of the Present State of Ireland, al- though the shoe is on the other foot, when Spenser attempts to construct a policy that might counter the threat of so many Malengins and Mal- fonts among the Irish, and in this case he solves their fundamental am-</page><page sequence="27">572 Spenser and the Vagrants bivalence by eliminating both vagrants and poets altogether. According to Irenius, Spenser's stand-in, vagrants should be systematically re- moved from the Irish countryside by martial law, a policy his interlocu- tor Eudoxus seems to think unnecessary. Undeterred, Irenius proposes organizing a police force to deal with vagabonds: if someone is found "idelye roguing" the first time, "hee may punish him more lightly, as with stockes, or such like; but if hee bee found againe so loytering, hee may scourge him with whippes, or rodds, after which if hee bee againe taken, let him have the bitternesse of marshall lawe" (152). It is perhaps not surprising that Irenius includes "Bardes, Iesters, and such like" among this group of "stragglers and runnagates" (151-52), since they are singled out earlier in the treatise for their responsibility in contributing to the moral deterioration of the Irish landscape and inciting the natives to strive for military glory in rebellion. Some poets are virtuous, he ad- mits, using "the sweete baite of their numbers, to steale into the young spirits a desire of honour and vertue" (75-76), although here too there are references to bait and theft- Irenius is unconcerned with poetic de- ceit as long as it is linked to honor and virtue. But the Irish poets, on the other hand, find people who are the "most licentious of life, most bolde and lawlesse in his doings, most dangerous and desperate . . . him they set up and glorifie in their rithmes, him they praise to the people, and to yong men make an example to foliowe" (75). In both contexts, jug- glers and jesters, rogues and poets, Spenser is worried that fiction and disguise will encourage the wrong kind of moral behavior and contrib- ute to rebellion. Michael Drayton, a student of Spenser, treats vagrancy with similarly political valences in The Muses Elyzium when his nymphs demand the apprehension of Venus and Cupid, who have been stirring up sedition by way of disguise and trickery: both are to be proclaimed rogues, imprisoned, and punished; Cupid, "this Vagabund" (270), will be sent back to his resident parish Mount Cytheron; and for Venus a "Pasport shall be made" (276) conveying her to Paphos.55 For Spenser the context of Ireland, a so-called "savage" nation, compels him to solve the interpretive ambiguity of rhetoric and disguise by eliminating the conundrum altogether. But he seems to acknowledge the loss that re- sults from these draconian measures, which reduce the positive poten- tial for poetry's fictions to steal into Irish hearts and instill virtue. If Irenius sounds confident that his policies will eradicate vagrancy and roguery, it is less clear that Spenser is. In almost every case, his 55 Drayton, The Works of Michael Drayton, vol. 3, ed. J.

The Fox in Mother Hubberds Tale is merely "uncased"- temporarily exposed to public view like Duessa (in book 1) and probably whipped- and the fox in the May eclogue succeeds in his crime. The earmarked Ape is likely to get into more mischief. Archimago, the "faitour false," is imprisoned after dis- rupting the betrothal of Redcrosse to Una at the end of book 1 in The Faerie Queene, but he is back out in faerie land tricking Guyon by the be- ginning of book 2, now called "a false infamous faitour" (2.1.30). Arte- gal literally cannot hold Malengin; it takes Talus, the iron footman de- void of pity, to make an end of his shapeshifting. There always will be vagrants to deal with in Spenser's poetry, it seems, just as there will always be enigmatic fables and allegories, misinterpretable figures that induce error. Spenserian rogues dramatize guile among strangers but more importantly the guile in human hearts and minds, the way vagrant desires and roguish language populate and produce interpre- tive dilemmas of various kinds. * * * I want to return briefly to the beginning of this essay, when the Fox and Ape in Mother Hubberds Tale first dream of "wandering to the worlds end." There is both a romantic temper and an apocalyptic note hovering around this description of vagrancy, gesturing at a much different kind of Spen- serian progress, one that the poem's frame invokes explicitly when the narrator recalls the various tales his friends recounted during his illness: "Some told of Ladies, and their Paramoures; / Some of braue Knights, and their renowned Squires; / Some of the Faeries and their strange attires" (28-30). Wandering, of course, is an activity of some etymological and moral interest to Spenser in The Faerie Queene- iî the Fox and Ape induce error in the strangers they meet, the Redcrosse knight falls victim to it during his wandering quest- and the final canto of book 1, in its drama- tization of Revelation, prefigures a different kind of world's end. Nor are these the only similarities between the Ape and Redcrosse. Consider, for example, their apparel: The Ape clad Souldierlike, fit for th'intent, In a blew jacket with a crosse of red And manie slits, as if that he had shedd Much blood throgh many wounds therein receaved[;] (204-7) and the other, who "on his brest a bloudie Crosse he bore":</page><page sequence="29">574 Spenser and the Vagrants Ycladd in mightie armes and siluer shielde, Wherein old dints of deepe wounds did remaine, The cruell markes of many' a bloudy fielde; Yet armes till that time did he neuer wield Full iolly knight he seemd, and faire did sitt, As one for knightly giusts and fierce encounters fitt. (i.i.i) As Herron notes, the modifier "blew" might describe the color of the Ape's coat, but it could also reference the grade of wool, so the two could be wearing precisely the same outfit.56 More importantly, both of them are playing the part of knight, seeming rather than being, scarcely linked to their military profession by more than the subordinating conjunction "as," mere similes rather than soldiers. Both immediately "wander loosly" after assuming their martial semblance, and one has just been commissioned by the monarch while the other will eventually usurp the throne. The Ape seems to be a kind of funhouse mirror image of Redcrosse, a cousin perhaps of Braggadocchio, "a losell wandring by the way" (2.3.1). Even the actual description of wandering is uncannily similar. After dispatching Error, Redcrosse and Una encounter Archimago: So forward on his way (with God to frend) He passed forth, and new aduenture sought; Long way he trauelled, before he heard of ought. At length they chaunst to meet vpon the way An aged Sire, in long blacke weedes yclad, His feete all bare, his beard all hoarie gray, And by his belt his booke he hanging had[.] (1.1.28-29) The Fox and Ape, meanwhile, seeking adventures as they travel, chance to meet a simple farmer along the way: Long they thus trauailed, yet neuer met Aduenture, which might them a working set: Yet manie waies they sought, and manie tryed: Yet for their purposes none fit espyed. At last they chaunst to meete vpon the way A simple husbandman in garments gray. (223-28) 56 Herron, "Edmund Spenser's Mother Hubberds Tale," 383-84.</page><page sequence="30">Evan Gurney 575 The language is identical, but the roles are reversed. Others have ob- served that Spenser replicates this formula in Mother Hubberds Tale dur- ing each transition into another episode: "Who passing foorth, as their aduentures fell, / . . . / At length chaunst with a formali Priest to meete" (359-61); "At last they chaunst to meete vpon the way / The Mule, all deckt in goodly rich aray" (581-82).57 These are relatively superficial similari- ties, and there is a possibility that Spenser is engaging in a bit of intertex- tual parody at his own expense. But I think it is more likely that Mothers Hubberds Tale (and the entire collection of Complaints) is connected to a similar preoccupation in The Faerie Queene, one that I have labored in this essay to link with vagrancy -the hazards of reading. And although the generic contexts are vastly different, Spenser uses vagrants in both works to complicate the interpretive dynamics of exchange- between the givers and recipients of material charity, between writers and readers- that are already vexed by issues related to rhetoric and belief. This discussion of the correspondences between Mother Hubberds Tale and book 1 of The Faerie Queene is preparatory to a final observation, or a question, rather, a kind of postscript for this essay. Because there is one crucial difference between the two works. Whereas the Fox and Ape rehearse in their roguish progress to the throne one of the greatest terrors among Elizabethan authorities, infiltrating the center of govern- ment, Spenser eliminates vagrants almost entirely from the allegorical domain of the latter cantos in book 1, most notably in the House of Holi- nesse. When Spenser forcibly removes vagrants from the Irish country- side in the View , in other words, he is merely staging a strategy he had already rehearsed in The Faerie Queene. Why? In the one episode when Spenser provides his most sustained description of almsgiving in The Faerie Queene, why does he make no mention of vagrants whatsoever? Why is the figure so conspicuously absent? Nearly every contemporary discussion of charitable giving references vagrants, often as an acute so- cial problem and sometimes as an annoyance, but invariably there they are, hovering around the discourse of poor relief. In startling contrast, when Spenser describes the Holy Hospital's seven beadmen, who in- struct the Redcrosse in the practices of corporal mercy, he offers a vision of indiscriminate giving that does not concern itself with determining the status of a potential beggar. The narrative seems blithely uncon- cerned with vagrants: "their gates to all were open euermore" (1.10.36). For several generations this particular episode has puzzled scholars, 57 Van den Berg, "'The Counterfeit in Personation/" 87-88.</page><page sequence="31">576 Spenser and the Vagrants who wonder why Spenser includes so many medieval and Roman Catho- lic features in the House of Holinesse. Perhaps scholars are asking the wrong question. Perhaps, that is, the episode stands out not merely be- cause of what is present but also because of what (or who) is missing. It is difficult to construct an argument from the absence of evidence; on the other hand, it seems unlikely that Spenser's virtue of holiness is wholly unconcerned with vagrancy given the book's repeated references to alms- giving. I suspect that Spenser recognizes the manner in which vagrants complicate any interpretive encounter, and he wants to stabilize the mo- ment in that narrative, and so Spenser provides a bulwark in the House of Holiness to keep a safe distance from its parodie rivals: the den of error, the malicious accusations of envy, or the extremes of pride and despair. This article has wandered far from its own place of origin, those first few verses in Mother Hubberds Tale when the Fox considers his various roguish prospects, but one thing is clear, I hope: while the majority of his peers believed vagrants to be an urgent and intolerable problem, Spenser clearly considered them essential to his poetic project. In the figures of rogues who populated both the legal and literary landscapes of sixteenth- century England, Spenser found an emblem of rhetorical and poetic guile that could serve several crucial purposes. By placing these vagrants throughout his work, Spenser provides a reminder of the interpretive traffic between bodies and texts, a dynamic fraught by its passionate dis- course and capacity for error, implicating his own misinterpretable alle- gory in the process. These figures of cunning and disguise illustrate the powers and limitations of any kind of fictive project, whether the false- hood be fair or foul, signaling Spenser's ambivalent attitude toward the instrumentality of rhetoric. The tricks and ruses of "faytours" throughout The Faerie Queene and elsewhere repeatedly force us to reassess the role and power of mercy in judgment, underscoring the dangers inherent to an interpretive posture of charity, even as Spenser, finding himself in a vulnerable position similar to that of vagrant beggars, reminds readers of his own reliance on their charitable interpretation. Finally, by depict- ing vagrancy and roguery as an interior condition intrinsic to every social estate, including those in seats of authority, rather than a moral corrup- tion limited to the lower classes, Spenser adds texture and humanity to his social satire, his treatment of vagrants revealing a poet as irenic, perhaps, as he is ironic. Indeed, if vagrants are on the social margins in Elizabethan England and Ireland, they are nonetheless central to Spenser's poetics. University of North Carolina , Asheville</page></plain_text>
