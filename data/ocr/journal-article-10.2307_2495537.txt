Lepenski Vir was a village site of prehistoric hunters and fishers on the Yugoslav bank of the Danube in the Iron Gates gorge. The site, as well as others like it in the area, is now totally submerged by the waters backed up from the Rumanian- Yugoslav dam. It has generated considerable excitement and controversy, both because it is the largest nonagricultural settlement in Europe and because it has a number of unusual features, notably a unique art style. Apart from Lepenski Vir and certain other sites in the Iron Gates region, the "mesolithic" of south-central Europe (here meaning anything postglacial and preagricultural, or at least nonagricultural) was known only from deposits in caves and from small open sites that lacked permanent architecture. The evidence of occupation was meager-small flint tools, splintered bones of the wild animals hunted for food, mollusk shells in coastal situations, and little else. Then suddenly in 1966 Dr. Srejovic's excavations at Lepenski Vir began to reveal a compact village of fishers and hunters, with sixty-five or so unique houses representing several phases of occupation. The houses were trapezoidal in plan, with their entrances facing the river. Most had hard floors of a mortar-hard, red-colored material, and set into the floor of each was a rectangular hearth made of thin limestone slabs, surrounded by smaller slabs forming a series of V's. At the rear of many hearths were found-again set into the floors-examples of an art that featured low-relief carving or pecking of river boulders, often into anthropomorphic forms up to fifty centimeters high. The dead were buried between and beneath</page><page sequence="2">Revzews 845 the house floors. No wonder then that this sensational find was hailed in the press as the "first city," and its newly unearthed art style acclaimed as "monu- mental sculpture." Srejovic's book is a popularized general report on Lepenski Vir-popularized in the sense that the detailed plans and systematic analyses of artifacts customary in specialist monographs are absent. Many interpretative statements are thus not supported by data, and the book can also not be used by specialists to evaluate the phenomena excavated. Furthermore, presumably in an effort to sell the book, the publishers have given it an inappropriate title. First, it is in fact a slightly revised translation of the excavator's Serbo-Croatian original (Lepenski Vir, 1969). Second, it neither deals predominantly with the stone sculptures nor does it present any "new discoveries" made since 1969, when excavations ended except for minor clean-up operations. Actually, the excavator promptly reported most of the sensational "discoveries," for example in the Illustrated London News for January 20 and February 3, 1968, and in Archaeology (1969). Obviously the book presents the data in greater completeness. Apart from the inherent interest in a rich cultural manifestation that does not fit the known sequence of archeological cultures, a major theoretical question is the relation of the Lepenski Vir culture with those surrounding it, and in particular with the first agricultural complex of the central Balkans, which seems to have been in the process of spreading and becoming established during the time span of the Lepenski Vir culture. Since there are no other archeological records in south-central Europe showing culture contact between the indigenous hunters and gatherers in the area and the spreading agricultural complex, or acculturation on the part of the indigenous population, the possibility of Lepenski Vir's representing such a situation is of great interest. It is a pity that no further field work can be done. One hopes that detailed publication of the excavations and the results of analysis of materials, from Lepenski Vir as well as from the nearby sites of Padina and Vlasac, will provide clarification. The comparison of certain classes of data, such as flint and bone tools, should throw much light on the interrelations of these three sites as well as their relations with the early agricultural complex. The book is competently translated (except for a few specialized terms), well illustrated, and includes a number of valuable appendixes on the ecology, geology, pollen, food-animal bones, human skeletal remains, and radiocarbon dating of the site.
