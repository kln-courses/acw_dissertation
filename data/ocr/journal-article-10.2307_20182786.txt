Bering Cognitive Evolution Group, University of Louisiana, Lafayette, Louisiana (D.J.P.), and Department of Psychology, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, Florida (J.M.B.) Abstract Although early compara tive psychology was seriously marred by claims of our spe cies' supremacy, the residual backlash against these archaic evolutionary views is still be ing felt, even though our un derstanding of evolutionary biology is now sufficiently ad vanced to grapple with possi ble cognitive specializations that our species does not share with closely related species. The overzealous efforts to dis mantle arguments of human uniqueness have only served to show that most compara tive psychologists working with apes have yet to set aside the antiquated evolutionary "lad der/7 Instead, they have only attempted to pull chimpan zees up to the ladder's highest imaginary rung-or perhaps, to pull humans down to an equally imaginary rung at the height of the apes. A true com parative science of animal minds, however, will recog nize the complex diversity of the animal kingdom, and will thus view Homo sapiens as one more species with a unique set of adaptive skills crying out to be identified and understood. Keywords chimpanzees; cognitive evolu tion; theory of mind; compara tive psychology Five to seven million years ago, a small lineage of anthropoid apes came down from the trees. Within a couple of million years, descen dants of this lineage had evolved a new form of locomotion (striding bipedalism), and had resculpted their pelvic girdle, head, hands, and feet. They tripled the size of their brain, and even appeared to have reorganized some of the most fundamental systems within that brain (see Preuss &amp; Coleman, in press). In a world already teeming with biological diversity, the hu man lineage made its debut. With the appearance of our spe cies came the ability to ponder those origins, and to pose such questions as, what does it mean to be human? and, more central to this essay, what psychological characteristics appear to be uniquely human? Such questions have challenged generations of in quisitive minds, all the while fuel ing controversy and divisiveness. Typically, the answers to such questions depended on the profes sion of the individuals being asked: To the theologian, the uniquely hu man endowment was the posses sion of a soul; to the psychologist, it was language; to the anthropolo gist, it was culture. DEMOLISHING HUMAN UNIQUENESS Alas, enter the first comparative psychologist, Darwin, who, run ning against centuries of religious and philosophical dogma, strategi cally announced that there is no characteristic truly unique to hu mans. "There can be no doubt," wrote Darwin in 1871, "that the difference between the mind of the lowest man and that of the highest animal is immense. Nevertheless the difference, great as it is, cer iainly is one of degree and not of kind" (Darwin, 1871/1982, p. 445). How could Darwin be so sure? To him and his followers, the answer was simple: Just observe other spe cies' natural, spontaneous behav iors, and then use introspection to infer the underlying causes of these behaviors. Although this may seem like a sensible enough approach, consider the full implications of this method: It makes the human mind the standard against which all other minds are judged, install ing our mental processes?and only ours?into the minds of other species. Even now, as data calling for a radical departure from this ca nonical view continue to mount, this most anthropomorphic (and ultimately un-evolutionary) of as sumptions continues to live on in the field of comparative psychology. In no case is this truer than in re search into the mental abilities of chimpanzees and other great apes. Here, the classic argument by anal ogy enjoys the protection of the suspect notion of "evolutionary plausibility." Researchers regularly assert that the parsimonious ex planation of behavioral similarity between humans and chimpan zees is the operation of equally similar psychological systems. Against this theoretical backdrop, Savage-Rumbaugh, mentor of the bonobo chimpanzee Kanzi, writes a book whose subtitle proclaims that her chimpanzee is "the ape at the brink of the human mind" (Savage-Rumbaugh &amp; Lewin, 1994). In a recent article, Sudden dorf and Whiten (2001) conclude that "the gap between human and animal mind has been narrowed" (p. 644). And de Waal's (1999) take on the same trend is that the chim panzee is "inching closer to hu manity" (p. 635).

Savage-Rum baugh, for example, declares that she has met the mind of another species and discovered that it is human: "I found out that it was the same as ours," she concludes. "I found out that 'it' was me!" (as quoted by Dreifus, 1999, p. 54). More typically, though, chimpan zees are caricatured as watered down human beings. Echoing Dar win, Fouts (1997) sees any attempt to demonstrate differences be tween closely related species as symptomatic of "Cartesian delu sions," and proclaims, "The cogni tive and emotional lives of animals differ only by degree, from the fishes to the birds to monkeys to humans" (p. 372). Likewise, Good all (1990) writes of a "succession of experiments that, taken together, clearly prove that many intellectual abilities that had been thought unique to humans were actually present, though in a less highly de veloped form, in other, non-human beings" (p. 18). All of this adds up to an agenda for psychological research with chimpanzees: "Just how human are chimpanzees?" We suggest, how ever, that the obsession with estab lishing psychological continuity between humans and other apes has cast this area of comparative psychology into a great freeze. It has contributed to marginalizing the discipline's mission by reduc ing it to a series of demonstrations in which one humanlike ability af ter another is revealed in nonhu man animals. It is an objective an chored to the mistaken idea that evolution proceeds linearly and that apes are thus playing catch-up to the human intellect. This objec tive, however, is fundamentally at odds with the central theme of modern biology: Evolution is real, and it produces diversity. Indeed, differences are seen as somehow obscuring the true evolu tionary relationships among living I species: "Researchers are regularly finding heretofore unexpected realms and degrees of similarity," noted Russon and Bard (1996), "and these similarities are particu larly useful for evolutionary recon structions" (p. 14). Not only is this point of view 180? out of phase with modern cladistic approaches to evolutionary reconstruction, but if the dramatic resculpting of the hu man body and brain that occurred over the past 4 million years or so involved the evolution of some qualitatively new cognitive systems, then this insistence on focusing on similarities will leave comparative psychologists unable to investigate hallmarks of their own species?or chimpanzees, for that matter. It is an agenda that does justice to no one. AN ALTERNATIVE FRAMEWORK: THE REINTERPRETATION HYPOTHESIS Perhaps the greatest obstacle to overcoming Darwin's a priori strait jacket of unbroken psychological continuity has been the difficulty of imagining an alternative. After all, if there really were a viable alterna tive, surely whatever intuitive an thropomorphic biases researchers have could be overcome?much in the way that Newtonian mechanics overcame tenets of Aristotelian physics. But here the challenge may be more substantial, because in this case, the very system that compara tive psychologists seek to investi gate is the one producing the illu sion, compelling these researchers to recreate the psychology of other species in their own image. In recent publications, we have suggested an alternative to the con tinuity paradigm, an alternative that we initially applied to the evo lution of a theory of mind?the abil ity to reason about mental states in the self and others (for an elabora tion of this model, see Povinelli, 2000, chap. 2). Our alternative pos its that for dozens of millions of years, the primate order produced numerous social species, each one inheriting a core stock of mamma lian social behaviors and then tweaking these behaviors to cope with the peculiar demands of its own circumstances. Although there is debate as to the key factors in this process, there can be no doubt that natural selection for social liv ing was intense during the radia tion of the primates, and with this drive to sociality came selection for social behavior to both exploit and cope with group living. However, rather than positing sociality as the prime mover for the evolution of psychological systems for representing other minds, our alternative holds that the vast array of spontaneous behaviors that hu mans share with chimpanzees, in cluding deception, gaze following, holding a grudge, tool use, recon ciliation, and organized hunting, emerged and were in full operation long before additional systems evolved to interpret these behav iors in terms of underlying mental states. Instead, these behaviors were generated through existing psychological processes, motivated by physiological, attentional, per ceptual, and affective mecha nisms?mechanisms that continue to guide an enormously compli cated assemblage of primate (in cluding human) behavior. The final part of our claim is that it was not until a particular lineage appeared?the human one?that a new representational system was stamped into the old, so that the observable world, and those things transpiring in it, were "reinter preted" with hidden meaning, al lowing humans to reflect on unob servable causes, such as mental states. Without discarding the an cestral mechanisms it built on, this novel causal explanatory system then generated its own subassem Published by Blackwell Publishing Inc.</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT DIRECTIONS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE 117 blage of behaviors (e.g., progres sive cultural transmission, reli gious rituals, and explicit pedagogy), all of which hinge on the ability to represent a social and physical world governed by ab stract causal forces. Because it envi sions that a hallmark of human mental evolution was installing a system or series of systems that in terprets ancestral behaviors in new ways, we have labeled our model the reinterpretation hypothesis. The reinterpretation hypothesis calls into question the fairly com mon assertion that if similar behav iors "are the product of a common history, then it is likely that the un derlying psychological processes re sponsible for the overt behavior are similar, too" (Suddendorf &amp; Whiten, 2001, p. 643). To the con trary, the reinterpretation hypothe sis makes clear that no a priori ar gument from similarities in spontaneous behavior will suffice. Although the recently shared an cestral heritage of chimpanzees and humans virtually guarantees behav ioral homologies, the totality of the representational software that rides alongside (or in some cases causes) similar behaviors in the two species is not necessarily the same. With this alternative framework? a theoretical approach that em braces both similarity and differ ence?it is now possible to return to the investigation of human uniqueness in the way that a biolo gist would address an investiga tion of the specializations of any species?open to wherever the em pirical facts seem to lead. DIFFERENCES IN THE MENTALITIES OF APES AND HUMANS Evidence that human evolution was marked by the emergence of novel mental abilities is beginning to accumulate. There is increasing evidence that, at some point after hominids separated from the line leading to the modern African apes, humans developed a unique capac ity to mentally represent a world of hidden causal forces, including men tal states. Consider the following: Although chimpanzees respond to eye gaze by following the vi sual trajectory of other individu als, even around barriers, they do not appear to grasp the fact that others' visual behaviors are accompanied by the psychologi cal experience of "seeing" (Fig. 1; see the review by Povinelli, 2000). Recent widely reported claims that chimpanzees may at tribute the mental states of see ing and knowing to other chim panzees (e.g., Hare, Call, Agnetta, &amp; Tomasello, 2000) have not been supported by at tempts at replication (Karin D'Arcy &amp; Povinelli, 2002). In carefully controlled studies, great apes have failed to appreci Fig. 1. Gaze following in a 6-year-old chimpanzee. The chimpanzee makes eye con tact with a human caretaker (top left), who turns and looks above the chimpanzee (top right); the chimpanzee then follows the caretaker's gaze (bottom). Although it is tempting to assume in such circumstances that the chimpanzee's interpretation of the situation is similar to our own (i.e., that the animal can infer that the person has "seen" something), the reinterpretation hypothesis (see the text for details) makes clear that in this and many other cases, high-level human cognitive systems may have been grafted into a suite of ancient systems that modulate quite ancient behav ioral patterns. Only programmatic experimental approaches will suffice to determine the presence or absence of such systems in other species.

Whether the communica tive attempt comes in the form of an extended index finger (i.e., pointing) or an iconic device (e.g., a replica of a box contain ing a food reward), chimpanzees do not seem to understand that the communicative behaviors of other individuals are driven by a desire to share information. A number of nonverbal method ological attempts to parallel re search on children's understand ing of the mental state of belief have shown that chimpanzees do not distinguish between indi viduals who are ignorant versus knowledgeable. For example, they respond to observers who have witnessed the hiding of food no differently than they do to those who are oblivious to its actual location?choosing at random who they would like to retrieve the reward for them (Call &amp; Tomasello, 1999). "Expert" chimpanzees that have been previously trained on how to perform a cooperative task (e.g., jointly pulling a heavy box by two separate ropes) with a human partner do not spontane ously guide naive chimpanzee partners on relevant dimensions of the task; these experts essen tially ignore the fact that their new partners lack the requisite knowledge for success, and fail to instruct them through teach ing behaviors (e.g., showing, touching, pointing; see Povinelli &amp; O'Neill, 2000). Interestingly, this pattern may translate to the nonsocial domain as well. Recently, we completed a project that was designed to map our chimpanzees' understanding of unobservable forces in the phys ical world (see Povinelli, 2000). The initial round of nearly 30 studies, conducted over a 5-year period, was centered on the widely cele brated ability of chimpanzees to make and use simple tools. How ever, we were interested not in the level of complexity that such tool use and construction might achieve, but rather whether chim panzees reason about the hidden properties and functions of tools. In particular, we asked whether chimpanzees' understanding of the physical world is mediated by con cepts robustly in place by about 3 years of age in human children? things such as gravity, force, shape, physical connection, and mass. The results converged upon a finding strikingly analogous to what we have described about chimpanzees' understanding of the social world: Although they are very good at understanding and learning about the observable properties of objects, they appear to have little or no understanding that these observable regularities can be accounted for, or explained, in terms of unobservable causal forces. In short, we have specu lated that for every unobservable causal concept that humans may form, the chimpanzee will rely ex clusively upon an analogue con cept, constructed from the percep tual invariants that are readily detectable by the sensory systems. CONCLUDING REMARKS If there is one thing that our spe cies is obviously not very good at, it is imagining ways of under standing the world that differ markedly from our own. The pop ular press overflows with stories of empathie gorillas rescuing young children, cats scaling burning buildings to bring their kittens to safety, and dogs who think they are human. Whatever the behav ioral facts of these cases, one thing is certain: We humans will auto matically interpret the psychologi cal facts from the perspective of our evolved, but peculiarly distorted, ways of understanding the world. Research with chimpanzees and other great apes remains marginal ized within the cognitive and bio logical sciences largely because the field has failed to come to grips with the most important tenet of modern biology: Evolution is real, and it produces diversity. Compar ative psychology was founded upon the notion that organisms could be arranged into an evolu tionary scale or ladder in which the mental operations of living species were said to differ in degree, not kind. Most psychologists who work with chimpanzees continue to espouse this view. Because of the importance of comparing and con trasting the psychological systems of our own species with those of our nearest living relatives, there is an overwhelming need to train the next generation of these psycholo gists in the intricacies of the evolu tionary biology of the organisms they study. Organismal biology can provide the theoretical motivation to look for, and thus celebrate, the marvelous psychological differences that exist among species. Recommended Reading Bering, J.M.
