<plain_text><page sequence="1">LXVIII VOLTAIRE'S REACTION TO DIDEROT IF we render to the word philosophy its true meaning of "love of wis- dom," and inject into the word wisdom a few of the qualities suggested by the French word "sagesse," we shall find Voltaire and Diderot at the very heart of eighteenth-century philosophy. Since they were by no means wholly in agreement, a study of their personal and intellectual reactions should clarify many of the main issues and bring us a step nearer to an understanding of deism and materialism, of decadent classicism and renascent romanticism, and of the nobler eighteenth- century conceptions of reason and nature. This study will be centered around certain comments in Voltaire's hand in the margins of Diderot's works now in the Public Library of Leningrad.' Voltaire's reactions, however, are so often essentially personal that it will be necessary to consider the general relations between the two men. Certain letters of Diderot recently published have thrown new light on this rather unusual friendship, in which Voltaire appears the more tolerant and forbearing. An attempt will be made also to relate the essential ideas of the two philosophers to trends in modern thought. In a letter to Palissot Voltaire said: The philosophers are a small flock who must be kept from the slaughter. They have their failings like other men; they do not always write excellent works; but if they could all write against the common enemy, it would be a fine thing for the human race. The monsters called Jansenists and Molinists, after biting each other, are now joined in barking at the poor partisans of reason and humanity. These should at least protect one another from their fangs.... It is true that there are in Paris many charlatans in physics and in literature, but the political and theological charlatans are more dangerous and more hateful. The man in question [Diderot] is at least a philosopher; he is very learned and he has been persecuted.2 The very essence of Voltaire's attitude toward Diderot is expressed in these lines. For Voltaire was above all a party man and in a very real sense the I It gives me great pleasure here to express my appreciation of the courtesies rendered me during my stay in Russia in 1932 by both the Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and members of the staff of the Public Library at Leningrad, as also my thanks to the Guggenheim Foundation for making my visit possible. 2 XXXIX, 192.-References to the Moland edition of Voltaire's works will be thus in- dicated, by volume and page number alone.

Nowhere is this characteristic more manifest than in the contrast between his affection for Diderot and his hatred of Rousseau. His epithets against Rousseau have often been collected and repeated3 but it has not so often been pointed out that they were in- spired much less by diversity in thought than by questions of party loyalty.4 Rousseau was first of all an apostate, a "Judas," a false brother -and many similarly unflattering titles were added unto him. Voltaire found it very difficult to forgive him for writing so many excellent pages in his Profession de foi du vicaire savoyard, which he himself re-edited and republished time and again. On the other hand, the picture of his undying loyalty to Diderot, in the face, be it said, of many a trial, has much more rarely been drawn. The history of this friendship can be given here only in its broad outlines. As far as can be learned, personal relations between the two men began in 1749 with an exchange of productions and of letters-the Lettres sur les aveugles for the Elements de la philosophic de Newton, and an epistolary discussion of the religion of the blind. Voltaire considered Diderot's work ingenious and profound, and accepted the author into the company of philosophers by inviting him to a philosophic dinner.' Diderot in his reply kept the relations on a philosophical plane and failed even to acknowledge the dinner invitation. Twelve days later Voltaire was at Cirey with Mme du ChAtelet. After that estimable lady's death, he was in Paris again from the middle of October, 1749, until the middle of June, 1750. But the two philosophers failed to meet until Voltaire's return to Paris in 1778 after an absence of nearly thirty years. Diderot seems to have been too busy, too careless, perhaps too proud to make the connection. As Voltaire grew to know Diderot better, directly from a few of his books and from very rare letters, and indirectly through Diderot's many friends, d'Alembert, d'Argental, Mme d'Rpinay, Damilaville, and Catherine the Great, a real affection was added to an already sincere admiration for his intellectual attainments. In 1774 Catherine wrote to Voltaire of Diderot: "C'est une tete extraordinaire que la sienne; la trempe de son cieur devrait etre celle de tous les hommes" ;6 and Voltaire 3Cf. Vallette, Jean-Jacques Rousseau genevois, p. 396, n. 2; E. H. Wright, The Meaning of Rousseau, p. 32. 1 This opinion has been reached after an intensive study of Voltaire's correspondence. The evidence is cumulative, but references to a few of the more striking passages may be given: xLii, 150, 192 ("O comme nous aurions cheri ce fou, s'il n'avait pas ete faux frere"), 236-238, 364; xIIIi, 256, 263 ("II n'a m6me 6te pers6cut6 que pour des sentiments qui sont les miens"), 268, 286, 418, 425, 430, 438, 457, 530; xIiv, 83 ("L'infAme Jean-Jacques est le Judas de la confr6rie"); xLv, 125, etc. xxxvii, 22-23. 6 XLVMI, 551.</page><page sequence="3">Norman Lewis Torrey 1109 replied: "Je n'ai jamais eu la consolation de voir cet homme unique; il est la seconde personne de ce monde avec qui j'aurais voulu m'entre- tenir."7 In the course of this long friendship at a distance, Voltaire appears ever the more loyal, the more forgiving, the more just of the two. Once he has chosen Diderot as a "brother" and friend there is very little question of the sincerity of his esteem and affection. Diderot seems to have been unwilling to give himself wholly to the tie. In 1749, the year of their first exchange of letters, Voltaire--Diderot usually refers to him as "de Voltaire"-had a great reputation as a poet, but his character was being impugned, not to say maligned. Paris was full of the truths, anecdotes, and calumnies of the Voltariana. "II serait a souhaiter," Diderot writes in his Neven de Rameau, "que Voltaire e'ut encore la douceur de Duclos, l'ingenuite de l'Abbe Trublet, la droiture de l'abbe d'Olivet."8 Many of Diderot's friends had belonged to salons as un- friendly to Voltaire as that of Mme de Tencin. Among his most intimate friends, Grimm and Naigeon were often unjustly hostile, while d'Hol- bach was temperamentally unable to comprehend Voltaire. D'Alembert, who might have cemented the friendship, was much more highly es- teemed by Voltaire than by Diderot, and long served rather to keep the two men apart. More important still, Diderot was very jealous of his independence. He felt no desire to serve as acolyte to his celebrated fellow philosopher. On occasions even, in his effort to keep his judgment free, he was severely critical of Voltaire's works. Again, it seems evident that both men felt Diderot's superiority in metaphysics, Voltaire in all humility, yet maintaining his own position to the end, Diderot with that justifiable self-conceit of the man who knows more and knows he knows more. These attitudes are clearly shown in Voltaire's comments on Diderot's philosophical works, and in the latter's replies. Desnoiresterres, in the long years of preparation for his excellent biography of Voltaire, noted and was himself affected by the great change in his subject's character after the unpleasantness at Frankfort, and especially after the establishment of the patriarch at Ferney. It is a striking coincidence that Voltaire increased mightily in dignity and humanity at the very time that he most bitterly opposed the orthodox religion of his day. (G. Desnoiresterres: Voltaire et la societe au XVIII. siUle, IV, 507-508.) Diderot was gradually won over by the love of justice and the humanitarianism of his contemporary. Although "Ma- homet is a sublime work," he wrote, "I would rather have rehabilitated the memory of Calas."9 He is amazed at Voltaire's first efforts to give 7 xtviT,i 558. 8 (Euvres, v, 397. 9 EEuvres, v, 426.</page><page sequence="4">1110 Voltaire's Reaction to Diderot a public airing to the Calas affair, amazed that this genius, represented to him by Grimm and others as a petulant, jealous, self-centered old man, had a soul and human feelings that were revolted by injustice and that aspired to virtue. His exclamations end with that often-quoted phrase: "Quand il y auroit un Christ, je vous assure que Voltaire seroit sauve.'0 But three days later he finds the petty jealousy displayed in Voltaire's Eloge de Crebillon unforgivable, and decides that the author is no better than second-rate in every genre." A true friend would have understood and forgiven, or at least would not have allowed his momen- tary displeasure to result in such general depreciation. Diderot was capable, however, of rising to the heights of eulogy when the occasion required, when he had learned to know Voltaire better, and when he was bothered by the lack of sympathy and appreciation often shown to Voltaire by his friends Grimm and Naigeon. To the latter, who was outraged by one of the patriarch's habitual outbursts against his critics, he admits that Voltaire may often have been jealous, ungrateful, fawn- ing, but to his own hurt alone. The other side must not be forgotten: for this octogenarian has held the whip over tyrants and fanatics, he has been the constant friend of humanity, he has avenged innocence in distress; he has introduced Locke and Newton to France, has attacked prejudice, preached freedom of thought, inspired a spirit of tolerance, sustained good taste against odds; he has done several praiseworthy things and written a multitude of excellent works. His name is honored in every country and will endure throughout the centuries. And Diderot, rather than jump on a man in the mire, would now magnanimously lend the helping hand and pull him out.'2 The eulogy is perhaps a little too reserved, admits a little too much, is a little too eloquent to indicate sympathetic affection. To Diderot, caught in the welter and confusion of Parisian small-talk, Voltaire was too great and too distant-a rarefied presence, a sort of great god Brioche with invisible strings, for whom he had no desire to serve as marionette. It was Voltaire, then, who, as leader of the party, was ever taking the initiative. If Diderot was interested in stressing the divergences in their thought, Voltaire was more concerned in emphasizing the fact that they were both partisans of the same true philosophy, of tolerance, enlighten- ment, and humanity. In his first letter, he says he has long esteemed Diderot and rejoices to see that he is against "stupid barbarians who condemn what they don't understand, and people of ill-will who join with imbeciles in proscribing enlightenment."'3 A few months later when 10 Lettres d Sophie Volland (Paris, 1930), iI, 117-118. 11 Ibid., iI, 121. 12 This letter is dated 1777; it should be 1772.

The Berlin sojourn and the subsequent period of wandering form an interruption of eight years in the relationship. His next intercession was with Palissot, in the letter quoted above. For every renewed attack of Palissot against Diderot, Voltaire rose to the latter's defense, and had his letters to Palissot published. Diderot calls Voltaire's epistolary com- merce with Palissot shameful. It seems, however, that Voltaire main- tained the balance of friendship in all loyalty, as he was able to do so well in his invaluable letters to those mortal enemies, d'Alembert and Mme du Deffand. During the battles over the Encyclopedie Voltaire worked tirelessly to keep the little flock together. The period from 1757 to 1768 marks the height of personal relations between the two men. Diderot wrote letters only under the stress of necessity. Voltaire was dependent at first on d'Alembert, a regular and assiduous correspondent. His views were necessarily colored by those of this highly esteemed and loved friend. Mme d'IRpinay, on her trip to Geneva, was astonished to find that Voltaire considered d'Alembert the real force of the enterprise and was happy to disillusion him in favor of Diderot."4 Acting throughout the critical years as the party whip, Voltaire first asked Diderot the names of his persecutors (Chaumeix, Berthier, Omer Joli de Fleury) that he might treat them according to their merits.'5 His efforts were especially directed toward keeping the party united. He believed it might be wise if all the workers abandoned the enterprise together until satisfaction should be obtained, but warns d'Alembert not to quit alone.'6 Then when it became impossible to keep d'Alembert in line, he is angry with Diderot for not joining him, and, to set the ex- ample, demands the return of his own articles. Diderot was very slow as usual in replying; he was much too preoccupied and independent to understand the niceties of social correspondence. Voltaire had also asked Diderot to return a note that he had too hastily written on the Cacouac affair, and the failure to receive it worked him up to one of his too habitual frenzies. He wrote repeatedly to d'Alembert and finally to d'Argental demanding that Diderot burn the letter in the latter's presence. Diderot resented this petulant display of mistrust, but finally wrote a very conciliatory and touching letter, in which he asked Vol- 14 XXXIX, 333.

In the letter, Diderot shows how chimerical is the idea of breaking with the French publishing houses and states his program: "Que faire donc? ce qui con- vient a des gens de courage: mepriser nos ennemis, les poursuivre et profiter, comme nous avons fait, de l'imbecillite de nos censeurs." The letter ends on a more personal note with a request for love and con- fidence: "Adieu, mon cher maitre; portez-vous bien, aimez-moi toujours. Ne soyez plus fache, et surtout ne me redemandez plus vos lettres: car je vous les renverrais, et n'oublierais jamais cette injure."'8 Voltaire was completely won over by this letter. Henceforth be appre- ciates especially Diderot's goodness of heart,'9 his human and emotional qualities. True, he writes time and again how sorry he is that "poor Diderot" is the slave of the book-dealers and at the mercy of bigots, that the Encyclopedie should degenerate, owing to stringent censorship, into a collection of puerile declamations, that the authors have not been able to form a society of brothers. Several months later, by midsummer of 1758, the letters between the two men are much more frequent. Voltaire pledges his continued support, is afraid that Diderot may not be able to use such uncompromising articles as "Histoire" and "Ido- latrie," is delighted when Diderot asks for all possible articles from his "cher mattre," and on the eve of his departure for the Palatinate, sends best wishes for Diderot's glory and happiness, with vows of esteem and attachment. By November he virtually admits, in a letter to Diderot, that he had been wrong in following d'Alembert's advice and regrets that Diderot had not received better support.20 Palissot's Philosopizes was an especially treacherous effort to combat the philosophical movement. It was not only an attack at a cruel moment on the authors of the Encyclopedie; it was an attempt to separate the leader from the flock. Voltaire was praised as highly as Diderot and his intimates were condemned. D'Alembert felt sure that Mme du Deffand was one of Palissot's protectors and instigators. There is some plausi- bility in the supposition, in spite of that lady's protesting reply to Vol- taire's polite remonstrance. She, as well as Palissot, was interested in Voltaire's literary merits and in the now fading glories of the preceding age. She hated the encyclopedists and philosophers and would gladly have saved Voltaire for history and pure literature. The affair created an extremely embarrassing situation for the patriarch. He was obliged 17 xx=, 401. 18 xxxix, 402. 19 xX x, 422. 20 xxxx, 532, Cf. XLI, 1 10</page><page sequence="7">Norman Lewis Torrey 1113 to state his position publicly, to reiterate his high esteem and affection for d'Alembert and Diderot, and to protest against Palissot's judgments. He wrote to the author: Vous m'accablez de politesses, d'eloges, d'amities; mais vous me faites rougir, quand vous imprimez que je suis superieur a ceux que vous attaquez. Je crois bien que je fais des vers mieux qu'eux, et m6me que j'en sais autant qu'eux en fait d'histoire; mais sur mon Dieu, sur mon Ame, je suis a peine leur ecolier dans tout le reste, tout vieux que je suis.2' This is interesting evidence that Voltaire was not always jealous of superior talent-not if his rivals were of his party and were named d'Alembert, Diderot, Buffon, Condorcet, Middleton, or Hume; nor is it possible to mistake the sincerity of his loyalty to his friends. The same loyal tone prevails in the letters to Mme du Deffand which were not written for immediate publication. The distance from Paris to Ferney, unkind rumors, and garbled accounts must be held responsible for Diderot's remark on the shameful nature of Voltaire's letters to Palis- sot.22 Voltaire's task of protecting the Encyclopedists was extremely deli- cate. It would not do to enrage the opposition to such a point that Diderot, "under its claw" at Paris, would be endangered. The latter felt quite often that that was the case and is seen alternately asking Voltaire for help and deploring the violence of his attacks against the common enemy. He failed to understand sometimes that Voltaire's outbursts of jealousy and irritability were often more party than personal matters. For Voltaire could forgive personal attack and applaud the works of other geniuses if the authors were or might be useful to his party in the struggle for tolerance. Diderot realized this in his better moments. Both in the heat and at the end of the long struggle, he thanked Voltaire for ever holding the whip over his enemies, and assured him that there was no man in the world whose life was more precious than his.23 For many years it was Voltaire's great ambition to have Diderot elected to the French Academy, first because it would be a mortal blow to the infamous persecutors of true philosophy, and secondly, because, as he wrote to Mime d'?pinay, no candidate was more worthy unless it be Spinoza.24 So great was his enthusiasm that he even promised to come to Paris to register his vote for "Socrates," and thus defy "Anitus," in the person of Omer Joli de Fleury.25 D'Alembert, recognizing the strength of the opposition, tried to discourage Voltaire, while Grimm and Mme 21 XL, 433. 2 Lettres d Sophie Volland, I, 268. 23 X,LI 79-80; (Euvres, xx, 73. 24 XL, 478. 25 XL, 453. See Voltaire's Socrate.</page><page sequence="8">1114 Voltaire's Reaction to Diderot d'1pinay knew that Diderot would never take the necessary steps and follow Voltaire's cynical suggestion of procedure: Diderot could deny that he wrote a certain metaphysical treatise, profess once again his catholicity, seduce and go to mass with some pious lady, and success would be certain.28 Diderot's atheism was not common knowledge and Voltaire was anxious to show the world that the philosophers were good, patriotic, law-abiding citizens, who respected the deity.27 Diderot's essential goodness was publicly esteemed. His election to the Academy would have been a tremendous victory for philosophy. Regardless of motives and methods of procedure, it is regrettable that this long-endur- ing dream of Voltaire's was never fulfilled. A period of closer intimacy now ensued through the agency of Damila- ville who, from 1760 until his death in 1768, served to bind the two men more closely together. The advantages obtained through his official position greatly decreased the dangers of sending letters and packages through the post. Diderot was willing to let this enthusiastic servant of philosophy send the news of Paris to Ferney, and Voltaire's letters to Damilaville were always to be shared with their mutual friend. During these years Voltaire's affection for the man Diderot is rapidly developing. A letter from the heart is announced, but is unfortunately missing from the record.28 The letters to Damilaville reveal his esteem and affection: "Vous vous etes lie avec M. Diderot, pour qui j'ai une estime egale a son merite: la lumiere qui eclaire son esprit echauffe son coeur."29 In this most friendly and revealing correspondence, Diderot is at first "Panto- phile-Diderot," but this is soon changed to the steadily recurring "Platon-Diderot" or, in time of danger, M. Tonpla. In spite of his of ten- repeated objections to Platonic philosophy, Voltaire recognized Plato's genius, and undoubtedly meant this title as a compliment-at least there was nothing equivocal about it as in the "Semiramis" attached to Catherine II-yet it would seem that Lucrece or Lucien would have been a much more fitting appellation. Through Damilaville too, Diderot met Thieriot and rejoiced with him over the success of Tancrede, which Diderot praised for its pathos, se- cured through the use of pause and pantomine. He was prevailed upon to send his criticisms to Voltaire. Leaving aside for the present the more important critical ideas involved, it is noteworthy that Diderot desired still more pathos, more emotional feeling, and that Voltaire modified his play in accordance with Diderot's wishes.80 While consenting, how- ever, to make the father in Tancrede more pathetic and more touching, 26 XL, 503-504. 27 Letter to Stanislas; XL, 512. 28 XL, 526. 29 XLI, 68. 30 "Tftchez donc qu'Argire soit plus pere," XLI, 77; cf. xLI, 99, 101, 109.</page><page sequence="9">Norman Lewis Torrey 1115 he could not possibly be expected to approve unreservedly of Diderot's Pe're defamille. His tremendous interest in the success of that play must be attributed then to his friendship for Diderot and to his desire to see him elected to the number of the Immortals: "Joue-t-on Tancrede?" he wrote to Thieriot early in 1761; "joue-t-on le Pe're de famille? 0 mon cher frere Diderot! je vous cMde la place de tout mon coeur, et je voudrais vous couronner de lauriers."'l On the same subject, to Damilaville he wrote: "Puissent toutes les benedictions etre repandues sur nos freres! Puisse la lumirere eclairer tous les yeux, et l'humanite penetrer tous les cceurs!"32 and to the same: "Je prie Dieu pour le succes du Pe're de famille." This prayer to God eloquently shows to what extremes Vol- taire would go in the interests of friendship. This time again his hopes were dashed; the Abbe Trublet, an enemy of the Encyclopedie, "who compiled and compiled and compiled,"33 was elected. Voltaire wrote to Mme d'Epinay: Si vous voyez M. Diderot, priez-le de faire nos compliments au cher abbe Trublet. J'aime 'a mettre ces deux noms ensemble. Les contrastes font toujours un plaisant effet, quoi que le monde en dise.34 Voltaire's part in the Calas affair served to warm Diderot's heart to- ward the enlightened despot of Ferney. An eloquent, impassioned para- graph in a letter to Voltaire reveals the ardor of his enthusiasm: Ah grand frere, vous ne savez pas combien ces gueux qui, faisant sans cesse le mal, se sont imagine qu'il etait reserve a eux seuls de faire le bien, souffrent de vous voir l'ami des hommes, le pere des orphelins, et le defenseur des opprimes. Continuez de faire de grands ouvrages et de bonnes ceuvres, et qu'ils en crevent de depit. Adieu, sublime, honnete et cher antechrist.35 Diderot revealed himself here as a true brother. He carried out small commissions for Voltaire at Paris, and placed in safe and useful hands many copies of the Traite' sur la tolerance: "Ils sont tous pour les bien- veillants de l'homme et de la chose," he wrote to Damilaville; "Leur devise est aussi: Proscrivez l'infame."36 In their choice and approval of methods the two philosophers were never in agreement. Diderot had little taste for what he called "de plates et fastidieuses rabacheries sur Jesus-Christ et ses ap6tres."37 Voltaire based his appeal on history and the past, while Diderot, especially in- terested in the promising future of the natural sciences, was more sweep- ing and radical in his attack. Voltaire considered that metaphysical 31 XLI, 163, 172. 32 XLI, 215, 211. 33 Thus satirized by Voltaire in Le pauvre diable, x, 107-108. 34 xL, 255. 85 XLII, 253. 1 Correspondance intdite, i, 276. 3 Lettres d Sophie Volland, m, 176.</page><page sequence="10">1116 Voltaire's Reaction to Diderot works were too little read and understood for propaganda purposes. He would have liked to win over d'Alembert and Diderot, and asks Diderot to persuade Helvetius to join him in his battle of tracts.38 He formed the sublime project, in 1766, of retiring with these men and a printing press to Cleves under Frederick II's protection, far away from the bar- barians who had persecuted and assassinated the Chevalier de la Barre. There, with freedom and unity of purpose, humanity might at last be enlightened and the face of things could be changed. Diderot should at least come to see the spot that he had selected for the untrammeled manufacture of enlightenment, for Voltaire often expressed his regrets that he might die without seeing his beloved confrere.Y9 The dreams of this philosophic castle at Cl?eves were not destined to fulfillment. Voltaire alone was enthusiastic, and perhaps he, too, had misjudged the immediate dangers of persecution as well as the ties that bound him to Ferney. After disappointments and in moments of pessi- mism, it was his habit to repeat the final word of Candide and to set about cultivating his garden.40 Diderot wrote him another charming let- ter. Voltaire reread it time and again and his heart was alternately wrung and warmed. Diderot pleaded his family obligations, the decep- tive tranquillity of everyday life in the streets of Paris, the innocence and obscurity of his own life. The letter ends most eloquently: Illustre et tendre ami de l'humanite, je vous salue et vous embrasse. II n'y a point d'homme un peu genereux qui ne pardonnat au fanatisme d'abreger ses annees, si elles pouvaient ajouter aux votres. Si nous ne concourons pas avec vous a ecraser la bete, c'est que nous sommes sous sa griffe, et si, connaissant toute sa ferocite, nous balangons a nous eloigner, c'est par des considerations dont le prestige est d'autant plus fort qu'on a l'Ame plus honnete et plus sensible. Nos entours sont si doux, et c'est une perte si difficile a reparer!4' Diderot's naive honesty and simplicity completely won Voltaire's heart. In a more general way, it is very likely that Diderot was instrumental in the growth of "sensibilite," of that sympathetic love for men, which became more and more characteristic of Voltaire during the Ferney period. M. Thomas writes: C'est Diderot qui a communique a tout son siecle l'amour spontane de l'hu- manite, le besoin de substituer a la notion abstraite de l'homme general, tel que l'ont peint La Rochefoucauld ou Racine, la realite vivante de l'etre de chair, emouvant dans sa faiblesse, admirable dans son universelle curiosite.42 38 XLIII, 3. 39 XLIV, 357, 358, 361, 366, 407, 429, 432. 40 Cf.

Diderot would find his place there in the philosophic section along with Thieriot, d'Alembert, Marmontel, and Damilaville. The friendship continued its even tenor during the final decade of Voltaire's life. He was delighted with the progress of the Encyclopedie, in spite of its faults, delighted with the honor paid Diderot by Catherine of Russia, and ever ready to pay tribute to "the immortal vanquisher of fanaticism."43 True, he could not agree with the growing movement of atheistic materialism, and openly objected to Diderot's position in his Lettres de Memmius a Cicgron; but he forgives the atheists their dangerous metaphysics on account of their humanitv, their love of tol- erance, and hatred of fanaticism." At the age of eighty-two, he addressed an affectionate letter to Diderot, in which, not foreseeing his final tri- umphant visit to Paris, he regretted that he must die without meeting him. After mentioning their former friend Damilaville, he continues: Cet ami savait que nous n'etions pas si eloignes de compte, et qu'il n'eut fallu qu'une conversation pour nous entendre; mais on ne trouve pas partout des hommes avec qui on puisse parler.... Le peu que j'ai lu de vous me rend presque tous les autres livres insipides. En un mot, vos ouvrages et votre per- sonne causent mes regrets.45 In a fit of sickness, some years before, he wrote to Diderot that he was soon to see, presumably in the Elysian Fields, friend Damilaville, who likewise had denied intelligence in the universe, and that he would then know who was right. Disagreement, however, even on a question so important as this was no bar to friendship: "II me niait l'intelligence, et nous etions bons amis."46 And to Grimm he wrote: "Embrassez pour moi, je vous prie, frere Platon, quand meme qu'il n'admettrait pas l'intelligence.)"47 This tolerant attitude contrasts rather strangely with Diderot's fre- quent rigidity. In 1749, as a deist, Diderot had said he was a believer in God but lived very comfortably with atheists.48 Later, as an atheist, he found it very difficult to forgive Voltaire for remaining a deist. He is reported to have called Voltaire a "cagot," and certainly showed little tact, little respect for the sacred rites of friendship in pressing his point at inopportune moments. First he filled a whole letter with atheistic arguments for Damilaville while the latter was Voltaire's guest at Fer- ney. And it seems difficult to believe that he did not stress this same point, as we know he did the divergence in their appreciation of Shake- XLVI, 543.

Diderot would hardly have been himself, however, if he had not taken this occasion, too, for the exercise of his exuberant eloquence, thereby offering Voltaire, who had been forced to adopt the r6le of listener, the occasion for one of his more fa- mous bons mots: "Cet homme a de l'esprit assurement; mais la nature lui a refuse un talent et un talent essentiel: celui du dialogue."'" It is reported52 that after seeing Voltaire, Diderot likened him to an old fairy castle fallen in ruins but still inhabited by some old sorcerer. It would be unjust, however, to conclude a chapter on this friendship with such anecdotes alone, especially when we have an account written by Diderot which, in itself, forms an admirable summary of the preced- ing sketch of their personal relations: J'ai pris la liberte de contredire de vive voix et par ecrit M. de Voltaire, avec les egards que je devais aux annees et a la superiorite de ce grand homme, mais aussi avec le ton de franchise qui me convenait, et cela sans l'offenser, sans en avoir entendu de reponses desobligeantes. Je me souviens qu'il se plaignait un jour avec amertume de la fletrissure que les magistrats imprimaient aux livres et aux personnes: "Mais, ajoutai-je, cette fletrissure qui vous afflige, est-ce que vous ne savez pas que le temps l'enleve, et la reverse sur le magistrat injuste? La cigue valut un temple au philosophe d'Athenes ....." Alors le vieillard m'en- lagant de ses bras, et me pressant contre sa poitrine, ajouta: "Vous avez raison, et voila ce que j'attendais de vous..... ." D'autres en ont eprouve la meme indulgence." The picture is almost too perfect to warrant comment. Diderot is proud to the end of his intellectual independence, his full-toned frankness in the very face of the great literary dictator. Voltaire, affectionate, too great to be affectionately loved in return, again takes the initiative, in- dulgently awaits the word he can heartily approve and presses to his breast the man who had bravely fought so many battles with him in the cause of humanity. This rapid sketch of the personal relations between Diderot and Vol- taire is a necessary introduction to the study of Voltaire's appreciation of Diderot's thought and comments on his works. It has already been apparent that in a general way he was of the number of Diderot's con- 49 Desnoiresterres, op. cit., viii, 128. 60 XXXVII, 515. 61 Desnoiresterres, op. cit., viuI, 129. 62 Correspondance secrete, v, 292. 13 (Euvres, I, 394.</page><page sequence="13">Norman Lewis Torrey 1119 temporaries who knew, understood, and highly esteemed those works which the intrepid philosopher consented to reveal to his century. Many among them, Grimm, d'Alembert, d'Holbach, Mme d'?pinay, Naigeon, and others, knew, too, the works reserved for posterity. Voltaire was not one of this more intimate group. True, he offered to exchange manu- scripts with Diderot, but these were articles for the Encyclopedie. There is no evidence that he had any knowledge whatsoever of such important works as the Neveu de Rameau, Jacques le Fataliste, or the Rave de d'Alembert. Nor did he suspect the existence of a Sophie Volland. It was his acquaintance with a relatively small number of works, then, that led Voltaire to judge himself a mere pupil in matters concerning meta- physics and the natural sciences, to place Diderot in a position second only to Spinoza, to remark that he alone was capable of writing the history of philosophy, and, late in life, to write that his works made most other books seem insipid.54 Voltaire had considerable difficulty in procuring Diderot's works, especially after the death of Damilaville. He admits in a letter to Diderot in 1776 that he hasn't succeeded in getting them all and that he has therefore read relatively little. The number now in his library, at Leningrad, is nevertheless considerable: Pensees philosophiques. La Haye, 1746. In-12. [5-128].55 Memoires sur di.jerens sujets de mathematiques. Paris, 1748. In-8.

Londres, 1782.66 2 vols. in-12. [11-220.] It is an interesting fact that Voltaire's marginal comments in books written by his enemies are much more numerous than those on the pages of books of which he approved. The notes on the margins of Rous- seau's works, recently collected and published in full by Professor George R. Havens,57 are relatively numerous. The comments on philosophical and religious questions are likewise predominant. Volumes containing novels and plays are much more rarely annotated. Voltaire commented in the margins of two different copies of Diderot's Pensees philosophiques, once at some indeterminate date, and again, in a volume including the famous Entretien d'un philosophe avec Mde. la Duchesse de x x x, during the last year of his life. There are also page markers in the Pensees sur l'interpretation de la nature revealing his interest in, but not his reactions to certain arguments of that important work. For Voltaire's other com- ments it has been necessary to search his correspondence as completely as possible, and various other works such as the Preface to les Scythes and the Lettres de Memmius a' Ciceron. The light shed from this angle on the contrasts, compromises, and blendings of their opinions will clarify, it is hoped, the ideas of two men who were, and still are, potent factors in the making of the history of thought. Diderot's Lettre sur les aveugles was the occasion of the first recorded contact. The epistolary discussion of this work served to bring out the principal disagreement in their metaphysics which was to endure to the end. Voltaire was nevertheless sincere in his admiration for the ingenious- ness and profundity of the treatise. He had already himself written of Saunderson in his Elemnents de la philosophie de Newton and sent Diderot a new edition, in which the incident was described in more detail. He was especially pleased to note the scientific, experimental method em- ployed, and to recognize Diderot as a worthy brother in philosophy. Voltaire's objections were centered on the least scientific part of the work, on Diderot's supposition that Saunderson denied a God because he was blind: Mais je vous avoue que je ne suis point du tout de l'avis de Saunderson, qui nie un Dieu parce qu'il est ne aveugle. Je me trompe peut-etre, mais j'aurais, a sa place, reconnu un etre tres intelligent qui m'aurait donne tant de supplements de la vue; et en apercevant par la pensee des rapports infinis dans toutes les choses, j'aurais soupgonne un ouvrier infiniment habile. II est fort impertinent 56 It is possible that Voltaire left a standing order for Diderot's works as they appeared, and that this volume, published after his death and the transfer of his library to St. Peters- burg, was sent along and added to the collection. 57 Voltaire's Marginalia on the Pages of Rousseau, (Columbus, Ohio, 1933).</page><page sequence="15">Norman Lewis Torrey 1121 de pr6tendre deviner ce qu'il est, et pourquoi il a fait tout ce qui existe; mais ii me parait bien hardi de nier qu'il est."8 Clogenson remarks that it was because of his constant and profound conviction of the existence of a God that Voltaire was called a "cagot" by Diderot." Diderot replied by saying that Saunderson's idea of God is not his own, perhaps because he himself sees: "Ces rapports qui nous frappent si vivement n'ont pas le meme eclat pour un aveugle: il vit dans une obscurite perpetuelle, et cette obscurite doit ajouter beaucoup de force pour lui 'a ses raisons metaphysiques." He confesses that the darkness of night brings him doubts of the existence of God which are dissipated with the rising sun. To this subjective reason "a la Jean-Jacques," he adds others which he did not dare to attribute to Saunderson, on ac- count of the persecuting barbarians and imbeciles mentioned in Voltaire's letter. As the result of these arguments on the inconceivability of inter- action between matter and spirit, Saunderson would say that corporeal being is no less independent of spiritual being than spiritual being is of corporeal being; that they together compose the universe and that the universe is God; and Diderot cleverly turns Voltaire's argument against him: "Quelle force n'ajouterait point a ce raisonnement l'opinion qui vous est commune avec Locke: que la pensee pourrait bien etre une modification de la matiere !" He then comes directly to the heart of the question. To Voltaire's observation of the infinite relationship between things and the marvelous ordering of the universe, Saunderson would reply that these are merely subjective feelings that exist only in the mind, that man, like the ant and the worm, can find livable quarters in a world formed entirely by chance. Diderot then shows that the ques- tion is of no practical significance anyway. Although he believes in God he gets along very comfortably with atheists, who are enthusiastic about the good and the beautiful like other honorable people, and who are not deficient in moral conduct in spite of their belief in the theory of deter- minism. It is important not to mistake hemlock for parsley, but of no importance at all to believe or not to believe in God-an idea for phi- losophers to play with. Voltaire's own use of the case of Saunderson had been to prove that it is impossible to be unhappy through the privation of a good of which one is totally ignorant,80 and to show that sight angles in the eye do not give us judgments on distance and size except in conjunction with the other senses. His immediate reaction to Diderot's letter is not recorded. The contested point was, however, by no means dropped. Later discus- 58 xvii, 23. 69 Ibid., n. 3. 60 XyII, 469.</page><page sequence="16">1122 Voltaire's Reaction to Diderot sions of those same ideas show that he recognized the force and approved of the method of Diderot's argument. He undoubtedly suspected that Diderot's own opinions were dangerously near those that the latter at- tributed to Saunderson. Damilaville told Voltaire that an hour's con- versation together would have brought an essential agreement. Diderot could hardly have foreseen that Voltaire's long absence from Paris would put off that hour for nearly thirty years. During the intervening years both philosophers stuck to their guns, nor is there any record of submis- sion on either side. Eight years later, Voltaire had occasion to write to Diderot to thank him for his Fils naturel. It is an extremely skillful letter, in which Vol- taire succeeds in praising the author without praising the play, and ex- horts him, not to write another play, but to spread abroad as much as possible, in the Encyclopedie, the noble liberty of his soul: "L'ouvrage que vous m'avez envoye, monsieur, ressemble a son auteur: il me parait plein de vertus, de sensibilite et de philosophie. Je pense, comme vous, qu'il y aurait beaucoup a reformer au theatre de Paris."'" This new bourgeois drama must have fallen upon Voltaire like a bolt from the blue, a portent of the approaching collapse of good taste, of the classical drama, and consequently of French superiority in one of the few fields that seemed to Voltaire to remain indisputably hers. The English were definitely superior in the halls of philosophy, in the seats of government and on the high seas, but good taste and the classical drama were France's notable heritage from the age of Louis XIV, and of these glories Voltaire was the recognized champion. In this struggle Diderot could be no comrade in arms. Let him stick, then, to his En- cyclopedie. It would be a mistake, however, to suppose that Voltaire was entirely conservative in his views on the drama.62 He, too, as he insists, agrees with Diderot on the necessity of reforms. He does not say, however, that he agrees on the reforms suggested in the Entretiens sur lefils naturel. Some of his ideas were without doubt in conformity with Diderot's. In his letter of thanks he condemns the seating of frivolous noblemen on the wings of the stage, a reform which was accomplished two years later; and agrees that there should be no infamy attached to the presentation of virtuous sentiments. But Voltaire had had too much experience with audiences to hope for any sudden change in their attitude toward long- accepted technicalities and proprieties, nor would he probably have sug- gested any breaking down of the classical genres. These changes must 61 Cf.CX V 18 1. 62 Cf. Chapter "Voltaire and Shakespeare" in E. Sonet, Voltaire el l'injiuence anglaise.</page><page sequence="17">Norman Lewis Torrey 1123 be made gradually and the public must first be educated. Neither man was astute enough to see that no marked change was possible without a previous revolution in society. Voltaire returns to Diderot's dramatic theories in the prefaces to two plays, I'Tcossaise and les Scythes. In the total absence of marginal com- ment in his two copies of le Fils naturel, we must depend on these for definite observations. L'A9cossaise was hardly a serious play; here, then, was a chance to pay Diderot a few compliments without compromising drama in general. The play was written to avenge Diderot and his fellow- workers for the ill-treatment accorded them in Palissot's Philosophes; yet the man directly attacked was Freron. It was an eminently personal play, for the justification of which Voltaire happily thought of Diderot's Entretiens. That illustrious scholar and genius remarks very judiciously, he writes, that it is time to consider the representation on the stage not of characters but of the conditions and professions of men.63 Libelous criticism is a trade, and thus, with Diderot's help, the r6le of "Frelon" is brought within the pale of serious dramatic theory. The compliments paid to Diderot are sincere, but the rest is a bit of high fooling. Many other parts of Diderot's suggestions were entirely unacceptable to Voltaire, such as the domestic tragedy in prose and the emphasis on pantomime and tableaux. That we have no record of Voltaire's reaction to many of these innovations indicates remarkable restraint and loyalty. Voltaire had himself sought in his plays to increase action and to stress the element of pathos. But Diderot had gone too far and inevitably aligned himself with the admirers of Shakespeare. That Voltaire was well aware of the connection is evident from the Preface to les Scythes. He is ready to admit the greatness of Garrick in his Shakespearian roles, and the power of his appeal to the eyes, but this magical perfection in the actor tends to cover up the faults in the author: Cette magie a ete fortement recommandee il y a quelques annees par un philo- sophe qui, a l'exemple d'Aristote, a su joindre aux sciences abstraites, la connais- sance du cceur humain, et l'intelligence du theatre. I1 a ete en tout de l'avis de l'auteur de Se'miramis, qui a toujours voulu qu'on anim&amp;t la scene par un plus grand appareil, par plus de pittoresque, par des mouvements plus passionnes qu'elle ne semblait en comporter auparavant. Ce philosophe sensible a meme propose des choses que l'auteur de Sfmiramis, d'Oreste, et de Tancrade n'oserait jamais hasarder.... Ce n'est que par degres qu'on peut accoutumer notre the'tre a ce grand pathetique.... Souvenons-nous toujours qu'il ne faut pas pousser le terrible jusqu'a l'horrible.... Gardons-nous surtout de chercher dans un grand appareil, et dans un vain jeu de the'tre, un supplement a l'interet et a l'eloquence.

Diderot, cEuvres, vi, 150.</page><page sequence="18">1124 Voltaire's Reaction to Diderot que de se borner a les faire agir. Nous ne pouvons trop rep6ter que quatre beaux vers de sentiment valent mieux que quarante belles attitudes. Malheur a qui croirait plaire par des pantomimes avec des solecismes ou avec des vers froids et durs, pires que toutes les fautes contre la langue! Il n'est rien de beau en aucun genre que ce qui soutient 1'examen de l'homme de gou't. L'appareil, l'action, le pittoresque, font un grand effet sans doute; mais ne mettons jamais le bizarre et le gigantesque a la place de la nature, et le forc6 a la place du simple; que le decorateur ne l'emporte point sur I'auteur; car alors, au lieu de tragedies, on aurait la rarete, la curiosite.64 If this passage is a eulogy of Diderot as Voltaire claimed, it is also just as much a warning against Diderot's alarming tendencies, against what Diderot did not quite dare to advise, but would have advised if he had dared. Voltaire was plainly worried about Diderot's reception of the "eulogy," especially when he received no word about it. Many times in his correspondence he asks for information and says that he expected mention of the homage he paid Diderot in the Preface to les Scythes.65 Diderot had nevertheless expressed some novelties with which Vol- taire was in hearty agreement. His boldness may well have inspired in Voltaire the increased action and the spectacles of Olympie. Voltaire sent his account of the representation at Tournay to the "brothers" at Paris, with a special word for Diderot. Olym pie is thus seen to have been a genuine effort at compromise; Voltaire would expand a bit if Diderot would show more restraint: Je prie mon cher frere de dire au frere Platon que ce qu'il appelle pantomime je l'ai toujours appele action. Je n'aime point le terme de pantomime pour la tragedie. J'ai toujours songe, autant que je l'ai pu, a rendre les scenes tragiques pittoresques. Elles le sont dans Mahortnet, dans M&amp;ope, dans l'Orphelin de la Chine, surtout dans TancrAde. Mais ici toute la piece est un tableau continuel. Aussi a-t-elle fait le plus prodigieux effet. Merope n'en approche pas quant a I'appareil et a l'action; et cette action est toujours necessaire, elle est toujours annoncee par les acteurs memes. Je voudrais qu'on perfectionnat ce genre, qui est le seul tragique: car les conversations sont a la glace, et les conversations amoureuses sont a l'eau rose.66 In the account above mentioned, Voltaire had stressed the great emo- tional effect of his play: Les larmes ont coule pendant toute la piece. Les larmes viennent du cceur. Trois cent personnes, de tout rang et de tout Age, ne s'attendrissent pas, a moins que la nature ne s'en mele; mais pour produire cet effet, il fallait des acteurs et de l'action: tout a ete tableau, tout a ete anime.67 64 vi, 269-270. 65 Cf.

Diderot's role was to encourage him to greater activity and daring on these lines. While it is apparent that Diderot's dramatic theories induced Vol- taire to attempt a compromise with a view to holding the younger and bolder man in line with good taste, his actual productions could not hope to win over the dean of letters, le Pare de famille no more than le Fils naturel. Voltaire received the Pere defamille from Diderot in 1758. This edition is not now in his library, and the edition of 1770 is unannotated. The correspondence must again give us our information. Voltaire wrote a very polite and warm, but very carefully worded letter thanking him: Je vous remercie du fond de mon ccur, monsieur, de votre attention et de votre nouvel ouvrage. II y a des choses tendres, vertueuses, et d'un gofit nouveau, comme dans tout ce que vous faites; mais permettez-moi de vous dire que je suis afflige de vous voir faire des pieces de th'etre qu'on ne met point au theatre....68 Nothing could be more noncommittal than these sentences. The last re- mark is not a dig, however. We have seen how ardently Voltaire desired the representation and acceptance by the public of this play. A franker criticism appears in a letter a month later to Mme du Deffand. A certain amount of caution must be used in accepting this testimony, for this blind old lady was very influential in keeping Voltaire to the good old traditions and appreciated and praised above all his literary conserva- tism. She hated the philosophers and Voltaire undoubtedly shaded his ideas to please her, in passages such as the following: Vous etes-vous fait lire le Pare de famille? Cela n'est-il pas bien comique? Par ma foi, notre siecle est un pauvre siecle aupres de celui de Louis XIV; mille raisonneurs, et pas un seul homme de genie; plus de grAce, plus de gaiete; la disette d'hommes de tout genre fait pitie. La France subsistera; mais sa gloire, mais son bonheur, son ancienne superiorite . . . qu'est-ce que tout cela devi- endra?69 Voltaire sensed in Diderot's play a certain heaviness and lack of grace which has been the experience of many a reader since. His friendship and esteem for Diderot prevented, however, a frank expression of his literary judgment. This attitude is evident in a passage from a letter to Palissot: "Sans jamais avoir vu M. Diderot, sans trouver le Pcre de famille plaisant, j'ai toujours respecte ses profondes connaissances; et, i la tete de ce Pare defamille, il y a une epitre a Mme la princesse de Nas- sau qui m'a paru le chef-d'oeuvre de l'6eloquence et le triomphe de l'ku- manitg."70 68 xxxi, 532. 69 x, 563-564. 70 XL, 410-411.</page><page sequence="20">1126 Voltaire's Reaction to Diderot Another expression in Voltaire's letter to Diderot is noteworthy: the element of novelty apparent in all of the latter's works. Voltaire's en- thusiasm for Diderot and the enthusiasm of the philosophic clan in gen- eral can be explained by the new vistas that Diderot opened up in what appeared to be more and more a closed philosophical system.7' The es- sential differences between the two men in regard to the theater resolve themselves into relative degrees of courage and common sense. Diderot displayed the greater courage and his ideas were destined for the future. Voltaire realized in a more practical way the difficulties involved in breaking with the past; and his plays were the more successful. Voltaire's judgments on the Encyclope'die were as varying as was the value of the articles and the talents of the authors of that stupendous undertaking. He had, of course, nothing but the highest praise for the utility of the work as a whole,72 and for the tremendous energy and cour- age displayed by Diderot in his labors as editor. Even so, it was difficult for him to visualize the difficulties that beset the worthy editor and he chides him time and again for the inclusion of weak, compromising arti- cles and puerile declamations. In a letter to Mme d'Epinay, in 1760, he speaks of "pauvre Diderot, qui a trouve le secret de renverser le plus bel edifice du monde pour y avoir mis une douzaine de pierres mal taillees, qui ne s'accordent pas avec le reste du batiment."73 In a more particular way, Voltaire was indignant over Diderot's praise of Rousseau in the article "Encyclopedie," beginning with the words: "Oh Rousseau, mon cher et digne ami . . . ,"7 and regretted that Dide- rot had been so busily occupied with the editing that the Chevalier de Jaucourt had had to write three-quarters of the articles; not that he failed to appreciate the latter's work, but he preferred more from Dide- rot. To Panckoucke, who wanted to republish and modify the work, he writes, in 1769: "L'enthousiasme y nuit encore plus, et les exclamations a la Jean-Jacques sont d'un prodigieux ridicule."75 He recommended on occasions Diderot's articles "Hobbisme" and "Instinct," but on the whole, judging from a few remarks like the above and also from his rela- tive silence, he did not himself approve the enthusiastic style which Diderot shared, beyond a doubt, with his contemporary, Rousseau.76 To d'Alembert, he wrote: "II n'y a que vous qui ecrivez toujours bien, et Diderot parfois."77 It was d'Alembert who, in the eighteenth century, most nearly approached Voltaire's ideal of prose style, the Lettres pro- vinciales of Pascal. Once more Voltaire looks to the past for his model, 71 Cf. Jean Thomas, L'Humanisme de Diderot, pp. 64-65. 72 XL, 410. 7 XL, 417. 74 Cf. XLIV, 5, 492. 5 XLVI, 258; cf. xLvi, 479. 76 XLI 484.7 43</page><page sequence="21">Norman Lewis Torrey 1127 while Diderot points ahead to both the romantic and realistic schools of the following century.78 The theater and the novel were merely diversions in the lives of these men. True philosophy, the philosophy of enlightenment, the scientific method applied to all human interests, was their major concern, inevi- tably affecting their diversions. Here they saw more nearly eye to eye. "Si Dieu avait permis," Voltaire wrote to Damilaville, "que frere Platon, vous et moi eussions vecu ensemble, nous n'aurions pas ete inutiles au monde." But the brothers in philosophy were dispersed and did not act together, and Voltaire loses heart: "Il faudra donc finir, comme Candide, par cultiver son jardin."79 Slight differences of opinion concerning meth- ods of attack, slight differences in conclusions, become magnified partly because of the physical distance that separated them and partly because these were the major concerns of their lives. It is entirely natural that Diderot's philosophical thoughts should command especially Voltaire's attention and that the philosophical works should alone inspire marginal comment. It is impossible to determine how much time elapsed between the first skirmish over the Leltres sur les aveugles and Voltaire's first comments on the Pensges philosophiques. The correspondence helps here but little. The most probable supposition is that Voltaire turned to this book in 1760 when he was trying to prove, against the Preface of Palissot's Philosophes, that the latter had misrepresented Diderot in attributing to him ideas of La Mettrie. It was at this time that he sent for, and re- ceived, Diderot's Pensees sur l'interpretation de la nature.80 The earlier work must have given Voltaire some degree of comfort, for Diderot, aft- er many arguments in favor of materialism, professed himself a deist, and even a Christian deist with a Catholic profession of faith. Like Voltaire in his Traite de metaphysique (1734), Diderot presents, in the PensUes philosophiques, the arguments both for and against athe- ism. Voltaire's early comments, in the 1746 edition, are confined to sec- tions XXI and xxiii, dealing with this subject. In the sections immedi- ately preceding, Diderot has exposed the following arguments: the supposition of an inconceivable God does not help us conceive how movement could engender the universe; even if the marvels that shine in the physical order reveal some intelligence, the disorders which reign in the moral order annihilate all Providence; the existence of evil shows in God either powerlessness or ill-will, etc.; and such arguments cannot be met by mere invective. Voltaire has no comment on these passages. 78 Cf. Francis Birrell, "Things Diderot could do," Criterion, xII (July, 1933), 632 ff. 7x9 xim, 183. 80 Xi 413, 424, 435, 438; xLI, 227, 240.</page><page sequence="22">1128 Voltaire's Reaction to Diderot He had similarly given the atheist his due in his then as yet unpublished TraitM de metaphysique. Many of these problems he believed incapable of solution. Considering the narrow limits of human reason, was it not, however, more "reasonable" to believe in Intelligence? He would like- wise heartily agree with Diderot that Descartes and Malebranche, meta- physicians, had not been able to answer atheism or materialism. It was left for the experimental scientists, Newton, Muschenbroek, Hart- zoeker, Nieuwentyt, to give satisfactory proofs of the existence of a sovereign Intelligence and to show that the world was not a God but a machine. It was those same scientists, and not Descartes, who had given to Voltaire satisfactory proofs of the existence of an Intelligence and of the immutable laws of the universe. Diderot uses the argument to show that whereas the subtleties of ontology make skeptics, those who reveal the secrets of nature form true deists. "Pensee XXI" discusses the essential problem of whether the ordering of the universe shows purposeful creation, or whether it is merely the result of blind chance, of fortuitous throws of the dice. Diderot is here answering a common argument against atheism: J'ouvre les cahiers d'un professeur celebre, et je lis: "Athees, je vous accorde que le mouvement est essentiel a la matiere; qu'en concluez-vous? ... que le monde resulte du jet fortuit des atomes? J'aimerais autant que vous me dissiez que l'Iliade d'Homere, ou la Henriade de Voltaire est un resultat de jets fortuits de caracteres." Je me garderai bien de faire ce raisonnement a un athee: cette comparaison lui donnerait beau jeu. Selon les lois de l'analyse des sorts, me dirait-il, je ne dois point etre surpris qu'une chose arrive lorsqu'elle est possible, et que la difficulte de l'evenement est compensee par la quantite de jets. II y a tel nombre de coups dans lesquels je gagerais, avec avantage, d'amener cent mille six a la fois avec cent mille des ... la possibilite d'engendrer fortuitement l'univers est tres petite, mais... la quantite des jets est infinie, c'est-a-dire que la difficulte de l'evenement est plus que suffisamment compensee par la multi- tude des jets.8' It is clear that Voltaire is presented here with the ever troublesome ar- gument that the marvelous order and infinite interrelations which he at- tributed to intelligent and purposeful creation, might be merely the result of the workings of the laws of chance, that life might be regarded as "a negligible accident in a by-product of the cosmic process."82 His long note on this passage is headed "Paralogisme," a charge that Dide- rot is begging the question.

It is apparent that Voltaire's conception of nature is essentially static, for he has in no way comprehended the significance of the argument that motion is essential to matter; with him, motion is still something-a shaking here perhaps-which is added to matter, visualized as sand. Even less did he conceive of countless centuries of slow biological evolu- tion, a conception which, in Diderot's mind, was gradually breaking down the barriers between inanimate, animate, and intelligent beings; or as Voltaire put it, between sand, parrots, and men. Allowing for a free interpretation of the word "day," he was not far from the belief that God created the laws that govern the universe in six days, gave it a tap to set them in motion, and has been resting ever since.84 Voltaire's denial here of the existence of the dice would agree with his repeated refusal to apply the laws of chance to the universe. A very frequent note in the margins of the books he read is: "Laisse-la ton hasard; c'est un mot vide de sens."85 Chance was merely a name for an unknown or undiscovered cause. In a universe where he saw so many evidences of intelligent design, he was assured of the existence of a su- preme Intelligence. "I shall always be convinced," he wrote, "that a watch proves a watchmaker, and the universe proves a God."8" Even Spinoza admitted an Intelligence, he pointed out, and Plato, too, in spite of the fact that the rest of his thought was sublime dreaming. A more probable interpretation is, however, that he was indicating here the fact that the existence of the dice, or atoms, was merely sup- posed, and was supposed only as the result of intelligible logical rela- tions. He opposed the over-simplified theory of Descartes no less than that of Lucretius, who was so "completely ignorant of physics." He felt that Descartes had been very rash in saying, "Give me matter and movement and I will make a world"; for if it were proved that move- ment was essential to matter, this statement played directly into the hands of the materialists.87 It was Newton's laws of gravitation that gave him a reasonable belief in the existence of an intelligent God, and led him to stress the mathematical rather than the physical basis of the universe. In Les Adorateurs, he writes: Dieu n'a pas abandonne la matiere a des atomes qui ont eu sans cesse un mouve- ment de declinaison, ainsi que I'a chante Lucrece....

Mais il a voulu que les parties de la matiere s'attiras- sent reciproquement en raison directe de leurs masses, et en raison inverse du carre de leurs distances; il a ordonne que le centre de notre petit monde fat dans le soleil, et que toutes nos planetes tournassent autour de lui, de fagon que les cubes de leurs distances seraient toujours comme les carres de leurs revolutions. 8 In other words, it is not matter, represented as cubes, dice, or atoms, but mathematical and logical relations that give man an intelligible view of the universe. And in the continuation of the passage, Voltaire is seen rapt in mystic adoration of the laws of gravitation and of their Creator, the mover of the heavenly bodies. His inability to comprehend or refusal to consider the proposition that movement is essential to matter is shown in a second marginal note on the part of Diderot's argument quoted above dealing with that subject: "Le mouvement essentiel a la matiere n'est qu'une supposition. Et il n'est pas permis de fonder un sisteme sur une hippotese dont on ne peut avoir aucune preuve."89 Voltaire is here perfectly recognizable in his r6le of destroyer of sys- tems. He was usually successful in the fields of theology and metaphy- sics, but not so successful in matters of physics, geology, or biology. To many, the theory that motion was essential to matter had been satisfac- torily substantiated by experimental evidence. Among other discussions of the question, Voltaire, in 1768, read Toland's Lettres a SRrMne90 in which Toland seems to have made his point against Spinoza. Whether Voltaire chose not to understand the argument, or simply did not under- stand it, his comment was extremely evasive and trivial. Diderot's ma- terialistic atheism was again not a system, as Voltaire charged; he ad- mitted its hypothetical character, but stuck to the hypothesis on account of its scientific fecundity and because the hypothesis of the existence of God was not only scientifically, metaphysically, and ethically sterile, but served rather to becloud all issues to which it was applied. A third comment is found on the following continuation of Diderot's argument: Donc, si quelque chose doit repugner a la raison, c'est la supposition que, la matiere s'etant mue de toute eternite, et qu'y ayant peut-etre dans la somme infinie des combinaisons possibles un nombre infini d'arrangements admirables, il ne soit rencontre aucun de ces arrangements admirables dans la multitude infinie de ceux qu'elle a pris successivement.

On the margin, he wrote: "Il n'y a aucun, parce qu'il faut un dessein et que la matiere brute ne peut avoir de dessein. Spinoza admet la pensee avec la matiere, il admet des desseins." "Ah! but M. de Voltaire!," we can imagine Diderot saying, "Who is it that has told us time and again that matter is a great mystery, that we can never be sure of its properties, that for all we know God may have granted it design? And is it not strange to be seen here clinging desperately to a weakness in Spinoza's physics to make your point against atheism, when you yourself so often have accused Spinoza of that very heresy?" The argument of the existence of a deity from intelligent design has seemed much less satisfactory since the theory of evolution was intro- duced into biological science. Although Diderot never directly expressed this theory, his comprehension of it was entirely sufficient to meet his metaphysical needs. And while Voltaire was struck by the universal uni- formity and constancy of physical law, Diderot was amazed by the evi- dence of trial and error and by the monsters and misfits that were so prevalent in the biological world: the fundamental clash between the classical and the romantic points of view was evident in science and philosophy long before the new literary theories were developed. Modern philosophers would not accept Voltaire's anthropomorphic argument as valid proof of the existence of God or of intelligent purpose. Yet Voltaire, the rationalist, found a basic flaw in the suppositions of the more empirical Diderot. "Mechanism as a formulation of the laws of masses in motion," writes Professor Morris Cohen, "is a basic branch of physics, but not an adequate account of the whole of it." He agrees with Voltaire in maintaining that not formless matter, nor blind sensa- tion, but mathematical and logical relations form the intelligible sub- stance of things.92 To Diderot, the real mystery was not the manner of creation, which, given matter and its properties, might some day be explained by science, but the basic problem of existence. Within the limits of the laws which govern the universe, he saw that chance might well have produced Voltaire's much-admired patterns and designs. As Paul Valery has remarked, "la vie a quelque chose d'un accident . . . qui s'est fait des lois." Here again Diderot was blazing a trail for nineteenth- century science, while Voltaire was stressing certain fundamentals in reason and nature which it would have done well to keep in view. Voltaire reread and annotated the Pensees philosophiques in the edi- 9 Reason and Nature, p. 230.</page><page sequence="26">1132 Voltaire's Reaction to Diderot tion of 1777, the year before his death. Here his comment on Diderot's fortuitous throws of the dice93 is more brief: "Dans quelque moment que vous vous y preniez il y a toujours l'infini contre un, que l'univers ne se formera pas tout seul." Voltaire is suggesting here, half facetiously, as may be judged by other expressions of the same idea,94 that there is only one chance in a "million" that chance formed the universe. The expert d'Alembert did not relish his friend's display of mathematics, and the editors of the Kehl edition have pointed out that the force of the argu- ment is lost if it is granted that motion is essential to matter.95 Voltaire was now well aware that Diderot had long since passed from the deistic stand of the Pensees philosophiques to a working hypothesis of atheistic materialism. In a letter only recently published by M. Babe- Ion, Diderot wrote to Damilaville while the latter was with Voltaire at Ferney, reiterating his arguments in favor of abandoning the deistic posi- tion. He asks Damilaville to remind Voltaire of his fable of the misan- thropist who, brooding in a cave and seeking vengeance, came forth shouting "God! God!," thus bestowing on men an idea for which they would sacrifice their lives and yet about which they could never agree. As a result, men have since hated and killed each other for religious be- liefs. Diderot would remind Voltaire also that there is a distinction be- tween suppositions. A supposition that explains all phenomena would be considered true, whereas a supposition that can be applied to no meta- physical, physical, political, or moral question without obscuring it should therefore be considered false. The idea of a supreme being is all very well for such noble beings as Trajan, Marcus Aurelius, or Cato, but Voltaire's knowledge of history should prove to him that for the rest of mankind such an idea has been, is, and ever will be nefarious.98 The most direct and complete answer to these ideas appears in Vol- taire's Lettres de Memmius a Ciceron (1772), in which Diderot's argu- ments are voiced by Strato. Voltaire begins by pardoning the atheistic group their rashness, but asks pardon in turn for his weakness in believ- ing in the existence of God. He again denies the very conception of chance, which he says is merely the effect of an unknown cause. He then attacks Strato's principal argument: Il disait que la nature seule, par ses combinaisons, produit des animaux pensants. Je l'arrete la, et je lui demande quelle preuve il en a. I1 me repond que c'est son systeme, son hypothese, que cette idee en vaut bien une autre. Mais moi, je lui dis: Je ne veux point d'hypothese, je veux des preuves....

Diderot was presenting his hypothesis as the more fruitful in scientific and moral investigation; it was also for practical reasons that Voltaire was clinging to his. He felt the philoso- phers would be much more at liberty to enlighten mankind if they were not suspected of atheism, a theory which was commonly, if not philosophi- cally, held to destroy all moral sanctions. His search for the truth was more definitely limited by utilitarianism than Diderot's; he could con- ceive of no service rendered to mankind through the spread of atheism.98 He was much more loath, too, to admit that his own position was not certitude, but an hypothesis. It was for this reason that Diderot called him "cagot" and "esprit faible." In the end, Voltaire laughs indulgently with Cicero at the follies of the atheistic reasoning. After all, a single year of civil war does more harm to the world than all the atheists together could do throughout eternity. The Letters from Memmius conclude with Voltaire's doubts of the existence of the soul, his acceptance of determinism, and a reitera- tion of his life-long profession that moral precepts are universal and are engraved in the hearts of all men. It has been observed that a deist is a man who has not lived long enough to become an atheist. Length of life was patently not Voltaire's difficulty. Two factors stand out in his opposition to the rising tide of atheism: first, he was intellectually incapable of understanding the sci- entific advances of his century and hence unable to perceive the weak- ness of his proofs-his mind had early embraced Locke and Newton, to his great glory, but his development in the sciences stopped at that point; secondly, his utilitarian pragmatism, his humanism, led him to suspect that the spreading of atheism would aid in no way the happiness of mankind. Diderot thought it would in the long run, if true. For the ag- ing Voltaire the course seems too long and the outcome too uncertain to merit consideration in contrast with the approaching victory over religious fanaticism and persecution. Diderot, with his eye fixed on pos- terity, was sure that the future would justify his gropings toward the principles of evolution, and the consequent objections to a belief in an intelligent purpose and a benevolent universe. 97 XXVIII, 444. 98 XLVI, 106.</page><page sequence="28">1134 Voltaire's Reaction to Diderot Professor Cohen has neatly contrasted the two points of view. The application of the following remarks to Voltaire and Diderot can readily be made: Perhaps it is the social admiration for the prudent and law-abiding citizen which makes us cling to the old naively rationalistic and anthropomorphic doctrine that nature does nothing in vain. But it is also possible to see in animate nature a wild profusion of aimless growth surging like the storms and volcanic eruptions of the inorganic realm. In any case the almost inconceivable over-production and terrifically lavish destruction of life make it impossible to identify the processes of animate nature exclusively with purposive adaptations to prolong the life of the individual organism.99 Nor is the problem simplified, he concludes, if we consider the race rather than the individual. Voltaire's belief in God was largely a mystical adoration of the maker and mover of the heavens. His error was in attempting to demonstrate his intuitive perception by logical reason. His controversy with Diderot reveals him as much more a disciple of Descartes than he would have liked to admit. In physics, he saw that Newton had made many neces- sary corrections in Descartes' theories; but he continued to maintain the latter's naive theory that motion was something added to matter in the process of creation, in spite of the arguments of Leibnitz and Toland to the contrary. He seemed often to have regretted his acceptance of Locke's contributions to the anti-Descartes movement. His moral law engraved by God in the hearts of all men was not so far removed from what Descartes meant by innate ideas.'00 And it has been noted how Diderot used against him his repetition of Locke's idea that God might have bestowed upon matter the faculty of thought. This idea, in fact, fits in much more logically with Diderot's hypothesis of continuous cre- ation and slow evolution over millions of years, and with his suspicions that "l'animalite avait de toute eternite ses elements particuliers epars et confondus dans la masse de la matiere."101 J. B. Needham, in his recent book entitled Man a Machine, agrees with la Mettrie and Diderot that the materialistic hypothesis is alone scientifically fruitful, but that it invalidates in no way religious belief or speculative philosophy. Voltaire, who was a determinist, confessed to Mme du Deffand his feeling of the mechanical nature of man.102 The human mind might be a machine and the ?neid might have been me- 99 Morris R. Cohen, Reason and Nature, p. 267. 100 Cf.

Even today philosophy is holding its own against the much-her- alded advances of laboratory psychology and behaviorism; and men are hardly satisfied with an interpretation of the ?neid as the result of mere fortuitous throws of the dice. Diderot's "Pensee xxiii" is a continuation of the argument between the deist and the atheist. Voltaire's comments are revealing, with their indication that if Voltaire attempted to persuade the public of his belief in immortality he would in no way defend it between friends or in the intimacy of his library. Diderot wrote: "Le Deiste assure l'existence d'un Dieu, l'immortalite de l'ame et ses suites. .*..'114 In the 1754 edition, Voltaire scratched on the margin of the page: "Beaucoup de deistes n'admettent point l'immortalite de l'ame." And in the 1777 edition, he corrected Diderot's idea as follows: "Non, le deiste croit en dieu et ne croit pas pour cela l'ame immortelle. Voiez les saduceens." During this last year of his life the patriarch has weakened not at all in his disbelief in immortality and its concomitants, reward and punishment. Stripped of the belief in the divine sanction of morality, there is little left, in fact, of Voltaire's deistic faith except the attitude of mystical adoration in his relation to God.'05 Voltaire's objections to Diderot's hypothesis that nature by her own combinations, produces thinking animals, have already introduced us in some measure to the Pensees sur l'interpretation de la nature. Aroused by Palissot's falsification of the theories of the Encyclopedists in the Preface to Les Philosophes in attributing to them ideas gleaned from La Mettrie, Voltaire asked Thieriot to send him that work along with La Mettrie's La Vie heureuse.'08 Thieriot was lazy as usual and it was only after a long wait and through the agency of Damilaville that Voltaire finally received a copy.'07 "Je vais le lire," he writes in reply (19 mars, 1761), "et je suis s'ur que je trouverai cent traits de lumiere dans cet abime." That is, unfortunately, the final mention of the work in Voltaire's correspond- ence. In the copy in his library at Leningrad there are, moreover, no marginal notes, but only four markers or "sinets" which reveal merely Voltaire's interest, and in no way his reactions. The first sign of interest is shown at a passage defining experimental philosophy as distinguished from rational philosophy. In a sense, the distinction might well serve to illustrate the contrast in the fundamental principles of the two men. In religion and in ethics at least, Voltaire 103 XL, 104-105. 104 (Euvres, I, 137; 1746 ed., p. 46; 1777 ed., p. 41. 105 The evidence of Voltaire's mysticism will be the basis of a critical study, now in prep- aration. 106 XL, 413, 424, 435, 438. 107 XLI, 227, 240.</page><page sequence="30">1136 Voltaire's Reaction to Diderot stopped at the rational principle of natural law, while Diderot attempted to found his ethics on the biological grounds of identity of organization and saw in religion only an obfuscation of scientific experimentation. La philosophie experimentale ne sgait ni ce qui lui viendra ni ce qui ne lui viendra pas de son travail; mais elle travaille sans relAche. Au contraire la philosophie rationnelle pese les possibilites, prononce et s'arrete tout court. Elle dit hardi- ment, on ne peut decomposer la lumiere; la philosophie experimentale l"ecoute, et se tait devant elle pendant des siecles entiers; puis tout a coup elle montre le prisme, et dit, la lumiere se decompose.108 Voltaire again shows interest in Diderot's scientifically bold hypothesis concerning the mysteries of human generation and embryonic develop- ment.109 Voltaire, who himself often wrote on the same subject, either concludes that it is an insolvable mystery concerning which many con- flicting theories have been presented by such philosophers as Harvey, Maupertuis, and Bonnet-Diderot is never mentioned in this regard- or has his little joke at the expense of Needham's eels spontaneously produced in barley water, or of Father Sanchez's naive "conception" of conception. Here again, as in the case of fossils, Voltaire was a little too ready to ridicule scientific discoveries. His reasons for doing so were not scientific but utilitarian; the theory of fossils was being used to prove the story of the universal deluge, thus supporting the Scriptures, which in turn supported the persecuting Christians of his day; and the eels appeared to verify the chance and spontaneous appearance of life in the universe, without recourse to a purposeful, intelligent creator.110 Another marker indicates a forceful paragraph on the relative obscu- rity of the great masters. After giving due consideration to affectation, of which even the great Newton was guilty, Diderot explains how the speculative philosopher, in his ascent from perception through abstrac- tion to generalization, may mount so high that he finds himself alone on his mountain with only the spectacle of his intellectual ideas in view, covering like clouds the sensuous world beneath."' The contrasting metaphors are instructive: Diderot drags his metaphysics up a moun- tain, while Voltaire is ever searching for his in a dark abyss. A fourth and final marker shows Voltaire's interest in Diderot's quo- tation from Linnaeus to the effect that, by following the principles of natural history in the process of classification, man is a quadruped in no way distinguishable from the monkey."2 Diderot is interested in the case 108 cEuvres, ii, 20-21; 1754 ed., pp. 54-55. 109 (Euvres, ii, 25; 1754 ed., pp. 73v-74. 110 Cf. xxv, 153-158; xxi, 335-360; xxx, 508 if.

Voltaire has left us only the bare indication of curiosity; he was far from sharing Diderot's speculative interest in the future discoveries in natural history through experimental science; in spite of his rhetorical comparisons of men to insects crawling on an atom of mud, he was essentially a humanist and took for granted the classical conception of man's position in the universe. Voltaire's annotations in the 1746 edition of the Pense'es philosophiques had been inspired solely by the conflict between deism and atheism. His more numerous comments in the 1777 edition reveal a very different in- terest, a return to the fifty-year old controversy over the Pensees of Pascal. It was the publication of Condorcet's 1gloge et Pense'es de Pascal, in 1776, that renewed Voltaire's interest and led to his Dernie'res remar- ques, which Condorcet published in 1778."13 This time we know that the marginal comments must have been written in 1777, or very early in 1778, during the final and eighty-third to eighty-fourth year of his life. To this edition was also added the Entretien d'un philosophe avec Mde. la Duchesse de x x x, one of Diderot's most famous dialogues, published at this date under the name of Thomas Crudeli. This, too, has its quota of marginal comment. The didactic, personal tone of the introductory remark of the Pense'es philosophiques had displeased Palissot. Voltaire also had his suggestion. Diderot had written: J'ecris de Dieu, je compte sur peu de lecteurs, et n'aspire qu'a quelques suifrages. Si ces Pensees ne plaisent a personne, elles pourront n'etre que mauvaises; mais je les tiens pour d6testables, si elles plaisent a tout le monde.114 Voltaire commented as follows: "Pourquoi? il fallait dire si elles ne revol- tent personne." In this "declamation a la Jean-Jacques," Voltaire sug- gests here merely a more symmetrical, perhaps more logical conclusion to Diderot's hypothesis. The subject of Diderot's "Pensee i" is the passions, the source of man's pleasures as well as his pains: "On croirait faire injure a la raison, si l'on disait un mot en faveur de ses rivales; cependant il n'y a que les passions, et les grandes passions, qui puissent elever l'ame aux grandes choses."ll5 Voltaire, in his comment, remembers an old figure of speech found in Fontenelle's Dialogues des morts"ll which he had often used himself :"' "Les passions sont les vents qui font aller le vaisseau et qui le submer- gent." The two men are in essential agreement. This idea of the passions was common and general in eighteenth-century thought. 113 Cf Avertissement de Beuchot; xxxi, 1-2. 114 (Euvres, I, 127; 1777 ed., p. 3. 116 Uuvres, I, 127; 1777 ed., p. 5 116 Ed. de Paris (1757), I, 109.

Zadig: xx. 88.</page><page sequence="32">1138 Voltaire's Reaction to Diderot Diderot sings the praises of strong passions in "Pensee III": Les passions amorties degradent les hommes extraordinaires. La contrainte aneantit la grandeur et l'energie de la nature. Voyez cet arbre; c'est au luxe de ses branches que vous devez la fratcheur et l'etendue de ses ombres: vous en jouirez jusqu'a ce que l'hiver vienne le depouiller de sa chevelure. Plus d'excel- lence en poesie, en peinture, en musique, lorsque la superstition aura fait sur le temperament l'ouvrage de la vieillesse.118 Voltaire's comment shows that he would check in some measure the flight of this typically romantic paragraph: "II faut de l'entousiasme dans les grandes occasions; sagesse partout ailleurs." Many of his own best works resulted from highly emotional states: hatred of domineering in- justice, as in the case of the Diatribe du docteur Akakia; hatred of religious persecution in the Essai sur la tolerance; pity for the lot of mankind, and indignation for easy optimism in the Poeme sur le de'sastre de Lisbonne and Candide.119 Though he often had cause to regret his own frequent excitability, he is, nevertheless, known rather as the common sense philosopher. In his comment on Diderot's paragraph, he passed over the arresting idea of the effect of superstition on the artistic temperament, an idea which would provoke much more attention today. Diderot's defense of strong passions is continued in "Pensee iv": Ce serait donc un bonheur, me dira-t-on, d'avoir des passions fortes. Oui, sans doute, si toutes sont a l'unisson. ltablissez entre elles une juste harmonie, et n'en apprehendez point de desordres. Si l'esperance est balancee par la crainte, le point d'honneur par l'amour de la vie, le penchant au plaisir par l'interet de la sante, vous ne verrez ni libertins, ni temeraires, ni lAches.'20 Voltaire's comment shows his fear of the tendency of this argument: "Alors ce balancement est sagesse; il exclut l'entousiasme." He is quite worried to note that Diderot is an enthusiast. His own control of the passions was "reason," not an entirely scientific entity, but alloyed with much "wisdom" and intuitive "common sense." He suggests, too, that Diderot's attempt to rehabilitate the passions is mere word-play, a ques- tion ultimately of terminology. When it comes to the utility of the passions, however, Voltaire is in agreement with Diderot's "Pensee v": C'est le comble de la folie, que de se proposer la ruine des passions. Le beau projet que celui d'un devot qui se tourmente comme un forcene, pour ne rien desirer, ne rien aimer, ne rien sentir, et qui finirait par devenir un vrai monstre s'il reussissait!12i 118 Euvres, I, 128; 1777 ed., p. 7. 119 Cf.

Il en devint fou, et il en mourut." Diderot is leading up more slowly to his attack on the Jansenists, which will be fully expressed in "Pensee xiv." The next step in the argument, in "Pensee vi," is that acts of perfection must be capable of generaliza- tion. Diderot uses the argument against the manner of living of ascetics and hermits. Everyone should have the right to imitate Pacome: Cependant, il ferait beau voir une province entiere, effrayee des dangers de la societe, se disperser dans les forets; ses habitants vivre en betes farouches pour se sanctifier; mille colonnes eleves sur les ruines de toutes affections sociales, un nouveau peuple de stylites se depouiller, par religion, des sentiments de la nature, cesser d'etre hommes, et faire les statues pour etre vrais chretiens.122 Voltaire's comment is again corroborative: "C'est l'avanture de certains bracmans pitagoriciens terapeutes, premiers moines." He was of course in hearty agreement with this indirect attack on monastic life. In "Pensee ix," Diderot finds it impossible to desire the existence of a God who is often pictured in anger, wreaking vengeance, and choosing only a limited number to be saved: L'on serait assez tranquille en ce monde, si l'on etait assez bien assure que l'on n'a rien a craindre dans l'autre: la pensee qu'il n'y a point de Dieu n'a jamais effraye personne, mais bien celle qu'il y en a un tel que celui qu'on me peint.'13 Voltaire adds in the margin: "Et qu'on a toujours peint eternas quoniam penas in morte timendum. Lucrece." He had expressed the same idea re- peatedly in his works, beginning with the early 1plire d Uranie. But now, late in life, he pretends to believe that the argument would be more effective if it were shown that the idea of an avenging God is a very ancient and universal error and that Christianity merely took it over from the pagans and the Brahmans. Diderot observes, in "Pensee xi," many temperamental differences among the devout: La piete suivrait-elle aussi la loi de ce maudit temperament? Helas! comment en disconvenir? Son influence ne se remarque que trop sensiblement dans le meme devot: il voit, selon qu'il est affecte, un Dieu vengeur ou misericordieux, les enfers ou les cieux ouverts; il tremble de frayeur ou il bru'le d'amour; c'est une fievre qui a ses acces froids et chauds.124 Voltaire is again afraid to follow Diderot's stressing of the temperament and the emotions. "Cet homme est un malade," is his comment. m2 UEuvres, i, 128-129; 1777 ed., p. 11. This thought so typically a part of Diderot's moral philosophy was first published in 1746.

The Jansenist opposition to the Encyclopedie is readily understood when we read such passages as- Pascal avait de la droiture; mais il etait peureux et credule. ;le'gant ecrivain, et raisonneur profond, il ett sans doute 6claire l'univers, si la Providence ne l'euit abandonne a des gens qui sacrifie'rent ses talents a leurs haines."15 Voltaire had already agreed with Diderot on Pascal in advance, in his comment on "Pensee v." Here he makes a very understandable and characteristic correction. In the phrase "E1legant ecrivain," he has crossed out "elegant" and substituted "vigoureux." It has been noted that Voltaire had very high regard for Pascal's vigorous style. "Elegant" might do for Fontenelle, but never for the Pascal who penned that great model of French prose, Les Lettres provinciales.'26 With the main principles of Diderot's Entretien d'un philosophe avec Mde la Duchesse de x x x, Voltaire could not fail to be in accord. Diderot believes that intolerance is inseparable from religion, that the destruction of religion would be one terrible prejudice the less, that it is indifferent whether we be Christians or pagans-except that as pagans we might be a bit more gay. The philosopher Crudeli-Diderot teases his noble and devout interlocutrice by showing her the discrepancy between her con- duct and the Christian principles which she professes. He asks a noble lady the following questions: N'est-il pas ecrit dans l':vangile que celui qui a convoit6 la femme de son prochain, a commis l'adultere dans son cceur? ... Et l'adultere commis dans le cceur ne damne-t-il pas aussi sfirement que l'adultere le mieux conditionne? La Duchesse: Elle vous repondit qu'oui?'12 Voltaire will not allow Diderot his argument ad hominem nor the quota- tion from the New Testament which is contrary to the accepted code of Christian ethics: "Elle avait tort," he wrote. "La vraie vertu est de vaincre ses desirs." Diderot is attempting to convict devout women of inconsistency in tempting and thus damning their friends by following the prevailing mode of low-cut gowns: Elle me r6pondit que c'6tait une chose d'usage: comme si rien n'6tait plus d'usage que de s'appeler Chretien, et de ne l'etre pas; qu'il ne fallait pas se vetir ridicule- ment, comme s'il y avait quelque comparaison a faire entre un miserable petit ridicule, sa damnation 6ternelle et celle de son prochain.128 125 (Euvres, i, 131; 1777 ed., p. 17. 126 Cf. XL, 171. 127 "uvres, n, 515; 1777 ed., p. 143. 128 (Euvres, II, 515-516; 1777 ed., p. 145.</page><page sequence="35">Norman Lewis Torrey 1141 Diderot is perfectly justified in using Bayle's argument of the discrep- ancy between moral conduct and religious principle, and in singling out, in his gracious dialogue, an example that would especially impress his feminine listener. It is indeed surprising to discover Voltaire so literal- minded and carping in his comment: "II est trop ridicule de supposer une damnation eternelle pour avoir montre un peu de teton. J'aimerais autant damner une biche dans le temps de rut." At a later point in the dialogue, Crudeli asks: Et qu'est-ce que Dieu? La Duchesse: Un esprit. Crudeli: Si un esprit fait de la matiere, pourquoi de la matiere ne ferait-elle pas un esprit?129 Voltaire has starred the first "esprit" and written in the margin: "Un etre quelqu'il soit, tres intelligent et tres puissant, mais je ne sgais posi- tivement, ce qu'est esprit et mati?ere." He maintains his skepticism rather too seriously against the Duchess, who admitted at the beginning that she had no head for philosophy. Likewise when the lady admits that animals have souls,'30 Voltaire replies in the margin: "Vous ne devez point assurer que les betes aient une &amp;me; nous et elles, nous avons des idees, des facultes; c'est la seule chose dont nous soions surs." He is afraid that the Duchess will make the debate too simple for Diderot and will fall too easy a prey to his dialectic snares. The latter proceeds to tell the story reported by Bouguer, one of La Condamine's companions, of the resurrection of the dried and smoked serpent of Peru; and then another of the Lithuanian Jesuit Bohola who left at his death the money to cover the expenses of his beatification and also authentic memoirs for the confirmation of his virtues."1' Op- posite the "memoires authentiques," Voltaire has written: "Il faut met- tre le conte de ce boho-la avec celui du serpent de Perou." Really, the good Duchess must not be too gullible! Voltaire's final note is on Diderot's famous apologue of the young Mexican who skeptically refused to believe in the existence of a country across the seas governed by some fabulous old man. He fell asleep on a raft and was carried across the Atlantic where he was immediately con- fronted with the sovereign. The old man forgave him readily for his skepticism on the grounds that it was all in good faith, but began im- mediately to question him on the wayward conduct of his past life, for which, instead of being sentenced to eternal punishment, he is also granted pardon. Crudeli asks if the Duke would not have done as much 129 (Euvres, ii, 520; 1777 ed., p. 159. 130 (Euvres, loc. cit.; 1777 ed., loc. cit. 131 UEuvres, la, 520, 522; 1777 ed., p. 165.</page><page sequence="36">1142 Voltaire's Reaction to Diderot for any of his wayward children. His interlocutrice admits that he would, but says her husband and the old man are two different persons. Crudeli immediately presses his advantage and asks if she means that her hus- band is better, more forgiving, than the old man. The Duchess replies: "Dieu m'en garde! Je veux dire que, si ma justice n'est pas celle de M. le Duc, la justice de M. le Duc pourrait bien n'etre pas celle du vieillard."''32 Voltaire has often voiced this same idea of the guiltlessness of disinter- ested skepticism. But here he opens up an old question of method of attack: "Tout cela serait bon, si les cretiens avaient invente l'enfer. Mais comme c'est une folie imaginee il y a des miliers de siecles par les bracmanes il fallait faire voir a la Duchesse que les cretiens ne sont que des plagiaires. C'est la meilleiure methode." Voltaire regretted to the end that he had not been able to associate d'Alembert, Diderot, and Hel- vetius with him in the writing and publishing of tracts such as the Testament de Jean Meslier and the Sermon des cinquante. Diderot was interested in no specific attack against Christianity; long held in re- straint by family considerations and preoccupied with metaphysics, he went more profoundly to the basis of religious sanctions in general. His Pensees philosophiques not only represent his abandonment of Christian- ity for deism, but also clearly presage his speedy conversion to atheism. Voltaire's program, in contrast to Diderot's, is indicated in a letter to Helvetius, in 1763: Il parait convenable de n'6crire que des choses simples, courtes, intelligibles aux esprits les plus grossiers; que le vrai seul, et non l'envie de briller, caracterise ces ouvrages; qu'ils confondent le mensonge et la superstition, et qu'ils apprennent aux hommes a etre justes et tolerants. Il est a souhaiter qu'on ne se jette point dans la metaphysique, que peu de personnes entendent, et qui fournit toujours des armes aux ennemis. I1 est a la fois plus sir et plus agreable de jeter du ridicule et de l'horreur sur les disputes theologiques, de faire sentir aux hommes combien la morale est belle et les dogmes impertinents, et de pouvoir eclairer a la fois le chancelier et le cordonnier. On n'est parvenu, en Angleterre, a d6raciner la superstition que par cette voie.133 Voltaire's method was indeed much more effective in the enlightenment of the shoemaker as well as the chancellor. As a result, his body was re- fused Christain burial in Paris and was smuggled out of the city, while Diderot, a few years later, was quietly laid to rest in the chapel of the Virgin under the flagstones of the Church of St. Roch. 132 (Euvres, ii, 526, 527; 1777 ed., p. 179. 133 XLII, 514. The heading given this letter in Grimm's Correspondance (1br aoat, 1763) is much more descriptive: Aptire aux fideles, par le grand ap8tre des Delices. The letter has been variously assigned. In Caussy, Inventaire des Manuscrits, (1913), p. 88, it is erro- neously given as a fragment of a letter from Diderot to Voltaire.</page><page sequence="37">Norman Lewis Torrey 1143 When Voltaire arrived in Paris in 1778, it was not only his clothes and his wig that were out of date. He was fighting a losing battle to save the old classicism, he was defending the polished plays of Corneille and Racine against the vogue of the barbarous Shakespeare, he was uphold- ing the principles and methods of the English deism of the first half of the century, and he was still cherishing the principles of physics and meta- physics that he had incorporated into his Dlements de la philosophie de Newton in 1738. Diderot's printed works were comparatively little known, his true opinions even less. Voltaire could hardly have suspected that the future lay, for better or for worse, with his voluble, argumentative, enthusiastic, metaphysical friend whom he then was meeting for the first time. If we grant, however, the righteousness of Voltaire's struggle for tolerance, we cannot help but admire his single-mindedness and dogged persistency, and we can join the crowds in the streets of Paris yelling "l'homme a Calas" as the patriarch is carried by on the shoulders of the people, leaving Diderot for the moment free to prepare his manu- scripts for posterity.
