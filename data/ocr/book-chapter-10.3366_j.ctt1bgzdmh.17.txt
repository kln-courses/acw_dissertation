<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 11 ‘Master the chariot, master your Self’:  comparing chariot metaphors as hermeneutics  for mind, self and liberation in ancient Greek  and Indian sources Jens Schlieter In ancient Greece and India, the real use of chariots encompassed sports, cults,  journeys and combat. These uses of the supposedly most complex mobile tech- nology of early Greek and Indian culture suggest a potentially similar complex  metaphorical or ‘symbolic’ use of the chariot. It can be assumed that steering  fast chariots was a demanding and fascinating task: an intensive experience  of speed and mid-distance travel, but also a dangerous device, as numerous  reported instances of chariot accidents in ancient sources show. Thus, it should  not astonish that chariots (and chariot rides) were taken as a source domain,  forming a dynamic ‘anthropo-therio-technological metaphor’ for the interpre- tation of abstract target domains such as gods, or the philosophical reflection of  body, soul and liberation. In fact, in both (and other Eurasian) traditions chariots  were depicted as vehicles of gods such as the sun, i.e. as a symbol of cosmic sta- bility; they were, moreover, used as symbols of royal power and social prestige,  e.g. of kings and warriors (in the Iliad, Vedic hymns, and poetic literature); and,  finally, chariots served as metaphors for the ‘person’, the ‘mind’ and the ‘way  to liberation’. The parallel application of chariot imagery for the ‘Self’ and its salvific  progress in both Greek and Indian contexts is indeed most astounding – yet it  must be remarked that a certain Indian influence on pre-Alexandrian Greece is,  although highly unlikely, theoretically possible, since the absolute (and even  relative) chronology of the Upaniṣads is still a matter of academic dispute.  Applying conceptual metaphor theory as a hermeneutic tool, I will try to outline  subtle but important differences between the Greek and Indian chariot metaphors  for ‘mind’, the ‘Self’ and ‘liberation’ – for instance in respect to a ‘chariot pas- senger’ able to descend from the ‘chariot’ at a final destination, or with regard to  the ‘horses’ as either ‘parts of the soul’ or (neutral) ‘senses’, to be mastered by  the charioteer. A cognitive analysis of chariot metaphors, may, in other words,  be a valuable tool for highlighting those (sometimes hidden) philosophical pre- SEAFORD PRINT.indd   168 16/06/2016   08:18 </page> <page sequence="2"> ‘Master the chariot, master your Self’ 169 conceptions prevalent in abstract domains such as the ‘mind’, the connection of  ‘body and mind’, the relationship between the ‘rational’ and the ‘emotional’ part  of the ‘mind’, the relation between a ‘steering mind’ and the ‘Self’, etc. Methodology: Hans Blumenberg and conceptual metaphor theory Actually, there are as many different metaphor theories as there are – to apply  a metaphor – grains of sand on the oceans’ beaches. For my purpose, it will  hopefully suffice to name some insights of the cognitive approaches towards  metaphors (used also by Jurewicz in this volume), leaving aside theories that  treat metaphor as a poetic or rhetorical device. The basic approach has been put  forth by Mark Johnson and George Lakoff, namely, that mental activities, such  as visualising problems, orientation in time and space, etc., are metaphorical in nature. The metaphorical concepts that characterise those activ- ities structure our present reality. New metaphors have the power to create a new  reality. This can begin to happen when we start to comprehend our experience in  terms of a metaphor, and it becomes a deeper reality when we begin to act in terms  of it. If a new metaphor enters the conceptual system that we base our actions on,  it will alter that conceptual system and the perceptions and actions that the system  gives rise to’.1 Lakoff and Johnson distinguished between a ‘source domain’ that, grounded  in human experience, is used to visualise a ‘target domain’, a more abstract  realm – the human mind, the psyche, emotions, philosophical concepts, etc. The  target domain, the authors hold, is ‘constituted by the immediate subject matter’,  whereas the source domain provides the source concepts used in that reasoning. Metaphorical language has literal  meaning in the source domain. In addition, a metaphoric mapping is multiple, that  is, two or more elements are mapped to two or more other elements. Image-schema  structure is preserved in the mapping – interiors of containers map to interiors, exteri- ors map to exteriors; sources of motion to sources, goals to goals, and so on.2 In their later work of 1999, Philosophy in the Flesh, Lakoff and Johnson  champion three elementary principles: ‘The mind is inherently embodied.  Thought is mostly unconscious. Abstract concepts are largely metaphorical.’3  However, only occasionally do they point to the fact that the ‘embodiment’   experience is, nevertheless, manipulated through the age-old use of technology   1 Lakoff and Johnson 2003: 146.  2 Lakoff and Johnson 2003: 266.  3 Lakoff and Johnson 1999: 3. These maxims can be followed without subscribing to the  author’s claim that ‘reason’ is to be fully ‘naturalised’ (cf. ibid.: 4).

Accordingly,  in the field of chariots one will find – as source domain – the metaphorical use of  elements of the chariot as whole or in part (wheels, reins, centre/pivot, hub, body,  horses), chariot riding (speed, road, sound and heat of the axle; wind; steering,  etc.), or the broader use (sports, war, representation). As target domains, the  chariot had been used to represent heroic virtues; the mind/soul; the movement  of the sun and stars and the passing of time; air travel; etc. Declaring metaphors  to be part of the ‘cognitive unconscious’, Lakoff and Johnson argue in line with  a theory of ‘primary metaphors’ which are ‘part of the cognitive unconscious’: We acquire them automatically and unconsciously via the normal process of neural  learning and may be unaware that we have them. We have no choice in this process.  When the embodied experiences in the world are universal, then the correspond- ing primary metaphors are universally acquired. This explains the widespread   occurrence . . . of a great many primary metaphors.5 A more recent development of the ‘cognitive’ (or ‘conceptual’) metaphor  theory has been initiated by Gilles Fauconnier and Mark Turner as a theory of  ‘conceptual blending’.6 Mental frames, they argue, may not only encompass a  single ‘source domain’ but combine various ‘input fields’ which are ‘blended’  (or co-activated) in the metaphorical process. These input-domains may include  senso-motoric schemata or triggers of certain emotions, and even incompat- ible ‘input spaces’ can be creatively combined in the ‘blend’. The result is a  more encompassing, complex model of a combination of metaphorical domains,  which are held to be the original process of ‘creative’ thinking, because the  mapping allows us to solve complex problems by fusing distinct realms to an  integrated whole. Highlighting the more existential meaningfulness of metaphors, I will  turn to Hans Blumenberg, who, in the tradition of ‘history of concepts’  (Begriffsgeschichte), developed a ‘Metaphorology’ exemplified in various stud- ies of philosophically meaningful metaphors (e.g. the metaphor of a ‘book’ or  ‘text’ for the readability of the ‘world’; or the metaphor of ‘light’ as imagery  of ‘truth’). Metaphors put themselves in place of the otherwise unimaginable  reality of the ‘world’, ‘life’ or the human ‘self’. In his early work, Blumenberg  speaks of those metaphors that can principally not be reformulated as ‘concepts’   4 Cf. the ‘hard and soft energy’ metaphors (Lakoff and Johnson 2003: 157), or their remark,  that ‘science’ has been successful in extending ‘our basic-level capacities for perception  and manipulation via technology. Instruments like telescopes, microscopes’, and, in addi- tion, computers, have enlarged the capacities for ‘manipulation’ or ‘calculation’ (Lakoff  and Johnson 1999: 91).   5 Lakoff and Johnson 1999: 59.  6 Cf. Fauconnier and Turner 2002. SEAFORD PRINT.indd   170 16/06/2016   08:18 </page> <page sequence="4"> ‘Master the chariot, master your Self’ 171 as ‘absolute metaphors’: ‘The absolute metaphor . . . springs into a void, projects  itself on the tabula rasa of what cannot be fulfilled by theory; here it has taken  the place of the no-longer living absolute will. Metaphysics often proved itself  to us to be metaphorics taken literally; the disappearance of metaphysics calls  metaphorics back to its place.’7 A core function of those metaphors figures an  ‘existential’ quality: to provide understanding of the ‘non-conceptualisable’,  and, therewith, to reduce fear: ‘absolute metaphors “answer” those supposedly  naive, principally unanswerable questions whose relevance lies quite simply in  the fact that they cannot be eliminated because we don’t ask them but find them  asked in the foundation of existence [Daseinsgrund]’.8 For Blumenberg, meta- phors fulfil functions of human survival and self-assertion strategies – metaphors  do not reveal reality. Their function is to appease, because they help to reduce  unknown (reality) to something known (within the lifeworld); they relieve the  angst of ‘the monstrous and outrageous’.9 Metaphors allow us to speak of the  powerful and frightening in indirect ways; in so doing they help to keep the fear- ful at a distance. In that respect, metaphors fulfil functions that have been  explained by sociologists of religion as ‘contingency formula’ (Niklas Luhmann,  Hermann Lübbe), i.e., to transform the contingent into something that can at  least be addressed. Metaphors, therefore, describe the fundamental anthropolog- ical position of man, his relation to reality being ‘indirect, complicated, delayed,  selective, and, most prominently, “metaphorical”’.10 How these ideas, sketched  only roughly here, help to elucidate chariot imagery will be shown below. In  addition to the ‘grand theory’, Blumenberg argues that metaphors assumed the  negative image of being merely illustrative due to the fact that they appear to be  ‘genetically secondary’, a pure ornamentation – however, ‘the secondary signif- icance of metaphors is only the pretence an author creates by the reversal of the  genetic relationship in the representation’.11 In other words: for the construction  of meaning in abstract domains, metaphors are not secondary (even though they  may be secondary in reference to the lifeworld domain, as seems obvious in the  case of chariot imagery). On the contrary: they structure understanding right  from the initial moment. Significant for the case of chariot metaphors, the following observation of  Blumenberg actually builds on the ‘wagon’: ‘A metaphor demands a faithful  interpretation of all of its functional moments; if this is violated, the metaphor  regresses into allegory, in which the wheels of the wagon of any goddess may be   7 Blumenberg 1999: 23.

Sports, prestige, war: chariot and chariot use in Greece and India In the first millennium bce, to which the texts discussed below belong, chari- otry can be conceived as an already well-established technology in Greece and  in India. Therefore it is not necessary to enter the intense and sometimes grim  debate on the ‘true origin’ of the light and fast two-horse vehicle with one axle  and spoked wheels. However, I would like to express sympathy with the view  of Peter Raulwing, starting from evidence of the semantic field of chariots and  their parts: If we take all the available philological, linguistic, archaeological, archaeo- zoological  and cultural historical evidence into account, the most plausible solution seems to be  that the chariot must be regarded as a product of the city states of the ancient Near  East in the early 2nd Millennium bc.13 More relevant for my purpose is the technical structure, the supposed range of  use, and the ‘driving experience’ of the chariot. The chariot as a fast-moving car for usually one or two persons was, of  course, dependent on several independent innovations: First, the revolutionary  invention of spoked wheels (reinforced with a flat metal rim) replacing heavy  and massive, tripartite wooden wheels; second, the breeding of horses able to  provide motive power while bridled and yoked together (as a pair, or in the case  of the quadriga, four); third, a light body-construction or basket with a D-shaped  floor; fourth, a durable hub with an equally durable axis. The chariot complex  as a whole, however, presupposes an environment in which there were tracks,  roads, or, at least, a somehow ‘drivable’ ground. The latter remark may be trivial  – nevertheless, it will be seen that chariot metaphors build on this aspect, too. Comparing roughly Greek chariot constructions of the first millennium bce  with those of Indian chariots (known to us, apart from textual evidence, e.g. from  depictions on the Buddhist stūpa in Sāñchī, first century bce), the most obvious  difference seems to be the wheel: Indian chariot wheels had a large number of  thin spokes (in the earliest depictions of Sāñchī,14 ca. 12–33 spokes), whereas  Greek chariots, such as the Mycenaean box-chariot, were fitted with four-spoked  wheels (compare, e.g., the Apulian Calyx krater with Helios riding a quadriga of  12 Blumenberg 2001: 183. 13 Raulwing 2000: 99.  14 Cf. Sparreboom 1985: 14, 93–113.

In regard  to functionality, this and other differences, such as the comparatively larger size  of Indian chariots, seem to be of minor importance. Metaphorically relevant is  the fact that chariots in Greece were more often steered by a single charioteer.  Additionally, both in Greece and in India the individual shape of the chariot  differed regionally and in regard to the intended usage: as racing vehicle, mobile  platform in war, for royal festivals and ritual procession, or means of everyday  transport for the aristocracy. Although the military usage was important and has  been very often depicted (e.g. in Egypt or the Middle East), it has been argued  by Peter Greenhalgh and others that its predominant early use was in sports and  cults, whereas the military career came later.15 There are famous early descrip- tions of chariot races in Homer (Il. 23.249–623) and in the Veda.16 It was a  highly demanding sport – due to the difficult high-speed interplay of horses, the  artefact and the human charioteer – leading to various kinds of sometimes deadly  accidents reported in the sources. Dangers of driving included the breakdown of  the chariot itself (broken axes, spokes or wheels, etc.), runaway horses, clashes  of chariots, and so on. If I may add some more phenomenological comments on the experience of  driving this ‘anthropo-therio-technological’ artefact, it seems that, in the epoch  before riding of horses became common, nothing could equal the experience of  speed offered in chariot rides. The swiftness of chariots, Max Sparreboom sum- marises, and their use as a racing car, are the most prominent element of chariot  imagery in Vedic texts.17 The Indian and Greek chariots were not fitted with  suspension (some kind of basic suspension had been invented in Egyptian char- iotry);18 the off-road ride, leaving prepared tracks behind, must have been rather  rough and bumpy. On sandy ground, turning the chariot at high-speed must  almost inevitably lead, the pole being stiffly fixed to the chariot box, to a drifting  chariot. Graphic illustrations are the famous chariot race scenes in movies such  as Ben Hur. Tackling a narrow curve might even cause an overturn due to the  centripetal force,19 as can be acknowledged in replicas tested in experimental  archaeology. Large jumps of the chariot box are equally attested. This lends plau- sibility to the ancient conceptualisation of ‘flying’ not only as an imagined bird’s  flight but also as a ‘chariot ride’. For the driver – and probably even more so for  a purely observing passenger not involved in steering – the experience of speed  15 Greenhalgh 1973: 29f.; Sparreboom 1985: 32f. 16 See Forte and Smith (in this volume); cf.

The thundering sound of hooves at full gallop, the cracking of the wheels and  the whistling of the turning axles, initiated and controlled by a human charioteer:  all this must have contributed to the prestigious image of chariots. Additionally,  the chariot was not only one of the most complex technological artefacts of early  civilisation – it was also a very expensive technology,20 likewise in manufacture,  maintenance, and in the fodder supply for the horses. As a matter of fact, the chariot, ‘a widespread symbol of élite transport for  monarch and nobles’, and ‘the mystique of chariotry’ as such, were to lose their  prestige ‘in favour of the ridden steed by the first millennium bc’.21 Nevertheless,  in the late antique world, the chariot continued to be of importance in some  Eurasian regions, so that one should conceive of a long period of slow decline.  And even after having lost most its everyday use, it was, for instance in the  Roman period, still fashionable as a racing car. In India, Sparreboom observes,  the chariot survived the Vedic period as an important literary device, while  its lifeworld meaning had been marginalised, due to the fact that it had been  advanced and transformed into slower, taller, more representative, and often  four-wheeled vehicles (still named ratha).22 Chariots of the sun A major metaphorical enrichment of the chariot (gr. ἅρμα; skt. ratha) had been  its remarkably parallel application to the sun and its movement. In several ancient  cultures including Greece and Vedic India, the sun had been conceptualised as  a ‘rotating wheel’ (λάμπρος ἡλίου κύκλος; lat. solis rota; skt. kālacakra).23  Sometimes, the golden, flamed wheel is the wheel and axis of the sun-god’s  chariot; in other depictions, it is the shining aureole or crown of the sun-god as  the anthropomorphic chariot driver.24 Of metaphorical benefit had been obvi- ously the fast and steady drive of the celestial bodies from sunrise to sunset.  In Greek mythology, there are various narrations of the four horses yoked in  the early morning, whereas in the night, they are unharnessed and brought to  a heavenly watering place with ambrosia.25 In Orphic and Vedic hymns, the  horses and the chariot of the sun are praised as fast and steady runners. In India,  the sun-god Sūrya was closely connected to Kāla, ‘time’. Apart from those  20 Cf. Piggott 1992, Littauer, Crouwel and Raulwing 2002. 21 Piggott 1992: 41. 22 Sparreboom 1985: 92f. 23 Cf.

Gelling and Davidson 1969. 25 The question how the chariot returns from west to east in nighttime had been answered by  a travel through the underworld.

Here Sūrya is  shown on – or, as driving – a quadriga.26 We have to refrain from delving into  the details of sun-mythology here, but shall ask how this astonishing fact can  be explained, that a human artefact, the chariot, was used to illuminate ‘natural’  activities of the gods. Obviously, the chariot drive was plausible in connection  with the image of the ‘celestial paths’ of the sun and the moon. Accordingly, the  sun-chariot is depicted as running on a ‘heavenly’ track. Sunrise and sunset had  also – in Greece and India – been conceptualised involving an artefact, namely,  as the opening of reinforced gates through which the chariots of dawn, sun and  the moon pass while beginning or ending their daily journey. Moreover, the chariot, being largely independent of the contingencies of  natural movements (e.g. the rhythm of rivers), could be equipped with a human- like driver – human-like in respect of human intentions, namely, to drive along,  to stop, or to deviate from a scheduled journey. By conceptualising them as god- driven chariots, the ancients were able to appeal to the sun-god not to deviate  from the usual path. Any deviation, they thought, would lead to draughts, forest  fires, etc., as depicted in the unauthorised use of Helios’ chariot by his teenage  son Phaethon. Heraclitus of Ephesus states: ‘Helios (the sun) will not overstep  his measures; if he were to do so, the Erinyes, handmaidens of justice, would  seek him out for punishment’ (22 DK B94). Another very interesting aspect can  be seen in the description of the godly chariot drivers looking down on the world.  In the Ṛgveda (hymn 1.50), we hear: ‘Seven bay mares carry you in the chariot,  O sun god with hair of flame, gazing from afar’;27 in Ovid’s Metamorphoses, the  chariot-driving sun-god is even called mundi oculus (4, 228) (cf. Plato Politeia  6, 508a–c). In Greece and in India the god of the sun is the ‘bringer of light’, and,  as such, also a precondition for ‘orientation’. To summarise, the chariot, and the chariot ride as intentional, continuous  travel on a given track, elevated from the sphere of the ‘ordinary pedestrians’,  can be seen as a remarkable example of what we may call ‘techno-therio-an- thropomorphisation’. As can be seen from the descriptions of the chariots of  emperors in the lifeworld, the imagined sun-chariot was soon to exert an inverse  influence: representative chariots of emperors, kings and generals are variously  described as gold-coloured or even gold-plated vehicles of incredible represent- ative value, and it was obviously hoped that the qualities of the sun would be  metonymically transferred to the chariot driver or passenger. We may assume  that not only ‘young gods’ in heaven and earth were fascinated by this horse- 26 See Coomaraswamy 1927: pl. VII, fig. 24.  27 Doniger 1981: 190. Cf. RV 127.6, 128.1, 129.1.

Chariots as ‘anthropo-therio-technological’ metaphor for Self and  liberation: Parmenides, Plato and the Kaṭha Upaniṣad The next move in chariot imagery that will be discussed here can be illustrated  in Parmenides’ famous proem, in which the Pre-Socratic philosopher describes  a young man, probably himself, as driving a chariot from the ‘halls of night’ to  the light. According to the approach chosen here, we will focus mainly on the  metaphors used, and will try to elucidate them without referring in detail either  to the respective author’s philosophical propositions or to his poetic precursors:  the metaphors shall, as far as possible, stand for themselves. The beginning of  the proem narrates: The mares that carry me kept conveying me as far as ever my spirit reached, once  they had taken and set me on the goddess’ way of much discourse, which carries  through every stage to meet her face to face, a man of understanding. On this I was  carried, for on this the sagacious mares were carrying me, straining at the chariot  and guided by maidens along the way. The axle in the naves kept blazing and utter- ing the pipe’s loud note, driven onwards at both ends by its two metalled wheels,  whenever the daughters of the sun made haste to convey me . . . There stand the  gates between the journeys of night and day, enclosed at top and bottom by a lintel  and threshold of stone, and themselves fitting closely to a great architrave in the  aether . . . Whereupon the maidens drove the chariot and mares straight on through  the gates along the road. And the goddess received me warmly, and taking my right  hand in hers spoke as follows and addressed me: ‘Welcome, O youth, arriving at our  dwelling as consort of immortal charioteers and mares which carry you; no ill fate  sent you forth to travel on this way, which is far removed indeed from the step of  men, but right and justice. You must be informed of everything, both of the unmoved  heart of persuasive reality and of the beliefs of mortals.’28 In these introductory verses, the philosopher describes a chariot journey to an  extra-terrestrial place. A certain ambiguity remains as to whether the journey  ascends to ‘heavenly gates’ or descends to the underworld, Tartaros.29 The jour- ney itself, on which he is accompanied by goddesses of the sun, obviously serves  a narrative function – the young philosopher being ‘initiated’ (although the  content of these initiations are rather philosophical insights) into a central idea  of his famous philosophical vision: that being is, whereas the non-being not only  is not, but cannot even be thought. While the ‘daughters of the sun’ guide and  steer the chariot, the philosopher seems to perceive the impressive ride with all  28 Coxon 2009: 50–4. 29 Cf. Miller 2006: 18–24. SEAFORD PRINT.indd   176 16/06/2016   08:18 </page> <page sequence="10"> ‘Master the chariot, master your Self’ 177 of his senses: the loud sound of the axle in the naves, the blazing – emitting heat  and light. The wheels turn, on ‘this way, which is far removed indeed from the  step of men’, beyond the human-inhabited world: Here again, we encounter the  conception of an extra-terrestrial ‘road’ on which chariots drive. Interestingly,  we encounter another artefact on the chariot’s way: the obviously massive gates  (of dawn and sunset, cf. Homer, Il., 8.389–96) through which the chariot passes  – again on a ‘road’ (ἀμαξιτὸς). From Hermann Diels’ study onwards30 it has repeatedly been argued that the  chariot ride is only an allegory for the travel of the ‘soul’, i.e. a ‘shamanic flight’.  Some hold that a travel to the underworld, again as ‘flight of the soul’, is depicted  – e.g. of an initiate into secret mystery cults dying his ‘spiritual’ death.31 In most  interpretations, however, the chariot ride is only a literary device, paying tribute  to the ecstatic motivation of visionary poetry. As outlined above, and despite any poetic precursors, I would prefer to take  the narrated experience of chariot riding more seriously. Parmenides’ young  man is a passenger (comparable, in that respect, to the detached and purely  observing ‘enjoyer’, skt. bhoktṛ, of the Upaniṣadic chariot imagery discussed  below). As such, the passenger ‘desires’, as do the horses, to start the ride. He  enjoys his elevated position of observing the lifeworld of men. The ride in the  chariot, intensively experienced, not only justifies the ‘superhuman’ truth-claims  by the mode of travel to a ‘transcendent’ place (arrived at the divine place, the  philosopher claims his insights to be disclosed by the goddess of truth) – the ride  itself seems to be a preparatory part of the insights. Taking the ride seriously  implies that real-world chariot rides exerted an impact on Parmenides and on  the thoughts that he communicates. In other words, it bears characteristics of a  technologically mediated, ‘modernist’ experience. We call it ‘modernist’ here to  counter the tendency to read Pre-Socratic philosophy as a traditional and some- how naïve philosophy of nature. Further, the chariot imagery had already been enriched by two other  important input-domains: one being the aristocratic wealth, splendour and rep- resentative quality of a chariot in a technologically advanced environment (the  fortified gates, the road). Depicting a chariot passenger, the ‘proem’ entrusts  the ‘observing’ philosopher as traveller with aristocratic dignity. The second  input-domain is the metaphorised travel of the celestial chariot, especially the  chariot of the sun. In that respect, the chariot ride of Parmenides’ young man is  enriched by the quality of ‘light’ and ‘vision from above’ (long-standing met- aphors of ‘truth’ and ‘abstract overview’), but also by intentional steadiness,  reliability and responsibility. Even if out of sight in cloudy, foggy or stormy  30 Diels 1897: 46. 31 Cf. Kingsley 1999: 115.

Likewise the Parmenidean philoso- pher: he stays on track – being moved on a track, but unmoved in his thought that  there is only being, or: being is all that is. In other words, being on the chariot  of light itself, he looks from that perspective, the enlightened perspective being  the light-emitting vision of all there is – which is equivalent to: of all there is  to be seen. Therefore, the journey itself demonstrates already the highest view,  which is fully achieved in the final conversation at the destination. It is not only  a religio-philosophical justification strategy – it demonstrates what an elevated  driving-experience may achieve. Although there are first hints that the chariot as  an entire complex, including the driving sun-goddesses, interacts with the ‘saga- cious mares’ in an almost intentional way, it is, in my view, not yet a full-fledged  metaphor of the soul and its temporary or even final liberation.32 The most prom- inent examples of this kind of metaphor-use are, in Greece, Plato’s well-known  chariot simile in the Phaedrus, and, in India, the Upaniṣadic chariot simile,33 to  both of which I will now turn. As is well known, Plato uses the chariot imagery in a complex simile for  describing the difference between the souls of humans and of gods by pointing  to the ambivalent nature of the human soul’s parts, its heavenly ascent, and its  return to earth, i.e., rebirth (Phdr. 245c–256b). In Plato’s dialogue, the chariot  imagery is introduced by Socrates for proving the thesis that all souls are immor- tal, for ‘she is the source of all motion both in herself and in others’ (245c).  Everything that moves itself must be immortal. If the soul is that which moves  itself, it must be immortal. The Olympian gods may drive their chariot from the  heights of the Olympus to a stable place outside of the revolving world (κόσμος),  to the stable hyperuranian realm (ὑπερουράνιος τόπος) where they – after a turn- around, in which they cross the border of the moving fixed-star heaven towards  the ‘non-located location’ at the back – can descend34 from the chariot, take a  rest, may look down at the world, and then return after a full turn of the sub-lunar  heaven (cf. 274d) to their Olympian home. In contrast, the human soul is compared to the ‘composite nature’ of a  winged chariot and its driver. Whereas, however, the chariots and steeds of the  32 A defense of the full allegorical reading (such as Sextus Empiricus’ reading of Parmenides)  may be found in Latona 2008: 199–223. 33 Cf. Slaveva-Griffin 2003. 34 Forte and Smith (in this volume) are able to show, very convincingly, various parallels (or  ‘intertexts’) of the Parmenidean poem and the Iliad (the chariot race in Il. 23). The only  parallel that I would consider less plausible pertains to the equation of the Parmenidean  ‘path of thought’ with a lap in a chariot race. To me, it seems very important that the  outward journey arrives at a destination where the passenger descends and receives his  philosophical insights, and returns only thereafter – whereas the racing charioteer will turn  in high speed, without ever descending the chariot.

One, the white one, the ‘mindful’ (possessing ‘moderation’,  σωφροσύνη), is of noble descent; the other, the black one, of inferior descent.  One is able to understand the commands of the charioteer, whereas the other,  ‘appetitive’ part, or ‘desire’ (ἐπιθυμία), respects only the whip. While the chari- ots of the gods are equipoised and easy to handle, the human chariot is difficult to  steer, in constant danger of crashing. Steering, therefore, is immensely difficult.  The obnoxious steed of poor breeding wants to return to earth, to human desires,  and gets inflamed and sexually agitated if the chariot meets other chariots in the  sky. The noble steed, on the other hand, wants to ascend; if the charioteer could  steer the whole complex accordingly, the chariot would leave the inner space and  would enable the human soul to see being itself, reality, as it were. Actually, the whole chariot imagery does not follow a coherent logic of  lifeworld chariots in all details but alludes to a mythical picture (e.g. with its  ‘wings’), as G. W. F. Hegel already observed, commenting that this ‘myth’  has somehow an inconsistent ‘potpourri’ character.35 Even though the cognitive  analysis of the metaphors is still a valid undertaking, we have to note that Plato’s  chariots in some respect head into allegory. The imagery, however, is quite  clear: it builds on a tripartite nature of the soul as the chariot-compound, made  of the charioteer (as driver and passenger in one person) – who is the ‘rational’  (λογιστικόν), and whose bliss is realised in steering to the Imperishable; the  ‘mind’ (νοῦς) is held to be the ‘pilot of the soul’ (ψυχῆς κυβερνήτης, 247c) – and  of the two forces (τὼ δυνάμεις), symbolised in the horses: the innate nature of  ‘desire’ (ἐπιθυμητικόν), aiming for lust and sensual pleasures, and the ‘striving’  or ‘courageous’ (θυμοειδές), aiming for the higher, the (cultivated) striving for  the better. We may comment in passing that the imagery of an understanding,  obedient, white steed (on the right-hand side, of course) and a low-breed black  steed of stubbornness and sexual indulgence, unable to communicate (the white  one understands and follows the logos!), seems to allude to the Greek concep- tions of the ‘barbarians’ (e.g. of Ethiopia).36 The human driver of the winged  chariot must handle the antagonistic forces – only then will he realise autonomy  and steer his life for the better; finally, he will be able to steer his soul after  death to the immortal sphere of being. The simile, moreover, depicts what may  happen when two chariots meet, but these details may not be followed here.  Socrates concludes that, if the noble force within the winged chariot dominates,  and self-control prevails, then 35 Hegel 1986: 49. 36 Cf. Phaethon’s chariot travel that led to the ‘nigrification’ of the Aethiopians (Roscher  1965: sp. 2184). Belfiore, in contrast, argues that Plato alludes with the black horse to the  ‘satyr-like’ characteristics of Socrates (Belfiore 2006: 201–5).

But if  they choose the lower life of ambition they may still have a happy destiny, though  inferior, because they have not the approval of the whole soul. At last they leave the  body and proceed on their pilgrim’s progress, and those who have once begun can  never go back. (255c–256a).37 Humans are not able to enjoy a steady view, because they are not able to reach the  final destination of the heavenly journey, where the ‘immortal souls’ of the gods  ‘having travelled out stood upon the back of heaven’ (ἔξω πορευθεῖσαι ἔστησαν  ἐπὶ τῷ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ νώτῳ, 247b–c). Of course, in the context of the Phaedrus,  the chariot imagery can be taken as an example of how to counter the challenge  of a ‘desire-driven life’, but to decipher it only as a ‘justification of the best life’,  as Elizabeth Schiltz does,38 cuts off important soteriological dimensions. As has been variously observed, this Platonic simile of the chariot as the soul  has a very interesting parallel in the corpus of early Indian texts, namely, in the  Kaṭha Upaniṣad. Before discussing the metaphorical dimensions of the simile,  the relevant passage shall be quoted in full: Know the self (ātman) as a rider in a chariot, and the body, as simply the chariot. Know the intellect (buddhi) as the charioteer, and the mind (manas), as simply the reins. 4 The senses (indriyāṇi), they say, are the horses, and sense objects (viśaya) are the paths (gocara) around them; He who is linked to the body (ātman), senses, and mind, the wise proclaim as the one who enjoys (bhoktar). 5 When a man lacks understanding, and his mind is never controlled [ajuktena], his senses do not obey him, as bad horses, a charioteer. 6 But when a man has understanding, and his mind is ever controlled, his senses do obey him, as good horses, a charioteer. 7 When a man lacks understanding, is unmindful and always impure, he does not reach that final step, but gets on the round of rebirth (saṃsāra). 37 Jowett 1871: 589. This soteriological ideal of life as a complex psychosomatic procedure of  ‘steering’ to the border of the supra-empirical realm, detached from the realm of becoming,  is in line with Plato’s simile of the ‘divided line’ in the Politeia (509d–511e). The vertical  ascent in the chariot-soul simile would then correspond to the ‘c’-point of the simile of the  line. 38 Cf. Schiltz 2006.

As astonishing may count not only the fact per se, that chariot  imagery is used for exemplifying the human soul, but moreover, that it is done  so in soteriological contexts. In the Kaṭha Upaniṣad the simile of the chariot and  the horses aims at explaining the soul’s way to liberation, i.e., immortality (‘the  highest step of Viṣṇu’ depicts the place of final emancipation of transmigrating  ‘souls’). The ātman, the ‘self’, is the driver. The chariot, ratha – obviously the  body of the wagon – metaphorises the human body. It is steered by the ‘intellect’  (buddhi), which is, by means of the ‘mind’-reins, guiding the horses.40 But may we conclude that the authors of these similes are somehow depend- ent on each other, or did they use other common sources that did not survive?  A closer comparative look reveals that both similes, while phenotypically quite  close to each other, are, in terms of metaphorical systematics, rather distinct. The  Upaniṣadic simile, presumably older than the Platonic simile,41 presents a differ- ent anthropological model, as is shown in the table below. chariot passenger Phaedrus Kaṭha Upaniṣadsoul (psyche) [commander and driver one self (ātman), [or ‘serving commander’,  skt. and the same person] enjoyer (bhoktṛ)rathin] charioteer (driver) rational part of soul(to logistikòn méros)  reason / intellect (buddhi) reins [connection between soul and abilities] mind (manas)  horses (steeds) 1. desire (to epithymetikón) sense organs (indriyāṇi), 2. striving (to thymoeidés) i.e. touch, taste, smell, etc. chariot (body) [not metaphorically relevant] body (śarīra) path / road [air-lane as road] sense objects (viṣaya); i.e. perceptible world gods: back of heaven (intermediate station) end of road / end of travel humans: (epiphanic) vision of eternity [at the unborn; highest realm death?] 39 KaU 3.3–9; Olivelle 1998: 238–40 (Sanskrit text and translation). 40 Cf.

The Platonic ‘soul’, a skilled  charioteer by himself, may only enjoy the travel’s envisaged finish, the view of  ‘being’. The Upaniṣadic ‘self’ is purely a passenger (in that respect comparable  to the Parmenidean simile), not involved in the steering, that is conducted by a  second ‘person’, the charioteer.42 The passenger is a detached observer, already  enjoying the journey while still travelling to the place without return. In the  Upaniṣadic simile, the ‘self’ is depicted as fully liberated at the arrival – if so  achieved – or it has to return in the samsaric world. The latter, the Greek ‘metem- psychosis’, seems to be an even more inescapable fate of the Platonic ‘self’.  However, the Indian ‘self’ is only loosely dependent on the chariot, and may  leave the chariot in the final destination – just as the Olympian gods may do. In  the Greek simile, the charioteer (the rational part of the soul) has to govern espe- cially one side of his two-fold nature, namely, ruthless ‘desire’, the black steed.  In the Upaniṣadic simile, the case is different, as it depicts the central task as  ‘controlling’ the mind (i.e. the ‘well-tensed [reins]’, yuktena), whereas the horses  – as the senses – are not in themselves ‘bad’, simply because their behaviour  can be either ‘good’ (controlled) or ‘bad’ (uncontrolled). The worldly side of the  charioteer, his body, senses, etc., is not in itself of an inferior, or ‘evil’, nature.43 Obviously, we may see at play here the yogic idea that the senses should be  retrieved from their sense objects, and this is exactly the point where meditation  techniques assume their indispensable function. The Upaniṣadic simile builds  on continuous self-cultivation and self-transformation. It depicts the empirical  mind, if not properly reined, as ‘loose’, which will result in unrestrained horses.  By this, the ‘senses’ are handed over to their manifold sense objects, so that the  chariot will not stay on track (gocara), and will therefore remain in Saṃsāra. In  this respect, the Platonic simile offers a lower complexity: the horses are simply  antagonistic forces; the reins, or the proper connection of the charioteer and the  horses, do not come into the picture. The track, explicitly mentioned in the Indian  case,44 ensures that there is a road to be followed; the end of the road – as in  Parmenides, an elevated place beyond the world of becoming – will be reached by  the chariot on a track prolonged into heaven (leading to final liberation, mokṣa),45  42 This important difference, which is discussed by Magnone in this volume, is not mentioned  in Schiltz 2006, and only noticed in passing in Lupaşcu 2008: 343, 349. 43 ‘It is like this – as a man driving a chariot would look down and observe the two wheels  of his chariot, so he looks down and observes the days and nights, the good and bad deeds,  and all the pairs of opposites. Freed from his good and bad deeds, this man, who has the  knowledge of brahman, goes on to brahman’ (KauU 1.5; Olivelle 1998: 329).  44 A more thorough interpretation of the philosophic background of the Kaṭha Upaniṣad can  be found in Lupaşcu 2008. 45 Cf.

The Greek ‘soul’ profits as being a ‘pilot’, and his task is to overcome worldly  desire;46 his Indian counterpart, the ‘self’, profits from his chauffeur, a charioteer  who is able to train ‘his’ mind and to cognise himself, so that he manages to steer  the horses on their track into heaven. Andrew Domanski points out that the ‘Self  (ātman), as the lord of, and passenger in the chariot, is the animating presence, the  formless essence, the source which remains perfectly still, does nothing at all, and  yet enables all the activity of the chariot and horses’.47 Yet, the organic interplay  of senses, mind and intellect in the Upaniṣadic simile should not obscure the fact  that in yogic discourse it is repeatedly emphasised that the ‘intellect’ is unable  to cognise itself. It cannot cognise that there is an inner ‘self’ that is sometimes,  although not in the Upaniṣadic simile, called an ‘inner driver’.48 Chariot metaphors in India and Greece: historical dependency or  coevolution? In the form of a logical cascade, we may summarise the discussion above as  follows: The imagery (metaphorical systems) of chariots could unfold in India and Greece  in parallel ways: a. as myth of the travel of the chariot of the sun (and moon); b. as chariot race in cult and sports; c. as aristocratic symbol of power. These three metaphorical systems enabled the use of: d. T he chariot imagery of the anthropologically and soteriologically mean- ingful simile of the chariot of the soul. The latter (d.) developed largely autonomously in both traditions and had  explanatory power as long as e. t he metaphorical systems of chariot imagery (input-domains a., b., c.) could convince. Indeed, Parmenides, Plato and the author(s) of the Upaniṣad could build on  the mythical metaphorisation of the sun-chariot and the lifeworld presence of  real chariots. Obviously, the similes present ‘metaphorical blends’ of these  46 Cf., in contrast, the interpretation in Griswold 1986. 47 Domanski 2006: 50. 48 On the ātman as hidden inner driver cf. BU 3.7.

By  interpreting human psychology and soteriological philosophy with the chariot  imagery, it becomes clear that they established an ‘anthropo-therio-t echnological’  idea of the human body-and-soul: it is the ‘steerable soul’ (Aristotle preferred the  metaphor of the ship’s pilot)49 – a new, technologically mediated model of a  ‘kybernetic’ soul (ψυχῆς κυβερνήτης), which, at least in Greece, made a career  as a metaphorical model for steering any kind of complexity, e.g. the ‘state’ (cf.  Plato’s imagery of ‘steering the ship of the state’, e.g. Republic IV 488–9). But  why apply technological metaphors in the first place? The ‘manoeuvrability’,  such as it is, seems to reduce contingency. Applying the (in part) character of an  artefact to the ‘soul’ and the ‘self’ makes it possible to discuss an objectifiable  ‘self’ – a great cultural innovation (or, in more romantic terms, the beginning of  the ‘soul’s’ decline into the ‘mechanics’ of the ‘psyche’). Surely, it seems tempting to think that Plato might have borrowed the chariot  imagery from the East, given the ‘identity of the religious logic which subtends  Phaidros . . . and the Kaṭha Upaniṣad’.50 However, by paying close attention to  the metaphors used, we can also find remarkable differences. The most important  aspect pertains to the agency handed over to the chariot driver, the ‘intellect’  (buddhi), in the yogic system of the Kaṭha Upaniṣad. The charioteer may, by  concentration of the mind, rein the horses for reaching final emancipation, i.e.  the accomplished goal. There, the passenger and chariot owner, the ātman, may  descend. Arrived at his destination, he is no longer interested in any view of the  world, even if very elevated. In comparison, Plato’s simile offers full agency  only for the gods. The human soul-chariot may only very rarely, if at all, catch a  glimpse of the place where ‘being’ resides. While alive, the human ‘soul’ is ever  absorbed with steering the bad-natured horse. Although it is still tempting to construe an Eastern, Upaniṣadic influence on  Plato, as Paolo Magnone does (in this volume), it is much more likely that the  metaphorical use of chariots developed without direct historical dependency.  Already scholars in the nineteenth century voiced the opinion that the chariot  simile in Plato and the Kaṭha Upaniṣad may count as ‘one of the most interest- ing examples of accidental correspondence’.51 Yet, as argued above, I would not  describe the correspondence as purely accidental. Seen from a greater distance,  the two instances – and, we should add, the Parmenidean chariot ride – within the  early Indian and Greek traditions should be construed, as Lupaşcu argues, as a  49 Cf. Aristotle de anima (On the Soul) 406a. 50 Lupaşcu 2008: 349. 51 Muir 1879: xxxviii.

Therefore, each tradition could establish the ‘chariot soul’ for their specific  psychological and soteriological purposes, which are parallel, though not, as  Lupaşcu or Schiltz argued, nearly identical. A final strikingly parallel development (to be discussed elsewhere) may  be envisaged with the ‘end’ of the ‘heroic’ chariot imagery in both traditions  (above: d.). Our assertion is that in late antiquity, which saw the end not only  of the light and fast chariot but also of a certain ideal of embodied self-mastery,  chariot imagery was no longer fully ‘functional’ (an early example of this can be  seen in Sextus Empiricus’ allegorical reading of the proem).53 The Buddhist use  of chariot imagery in India, and the Christian use in late antiquity, may, there- fore, both best be described as a final allegorical phase, resulting in a rigorous  deconstruction of the ‘chariot (ride)’ and of its metaphoric force for visualising  the movement of the sun, human self-mastery, the soul, and the path to liberation. 52 Lupaşcu 2008: 348. 53 Cf.
