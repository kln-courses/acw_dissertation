STROTH ER For Tally Kampen, who never believed in the innocence of naturalism Since 1884, European travelers have been intrigued by the anthropomorphic sculptures displayed by certain Pende chiefs on their houses in what is today the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Wissmann et al. 1974 [1888]:82; Frobenius 1988:216-217). This custom survives among the Eastern Pende where an increasing number of chiefs began to mount sculptures in the 1970s (figs. 1-2). At Ndjindji (an important Eastern Pende center), the origin of this practice is situated in the mid nineteenth century, in struggles for political ascendency between two ambitious chiefs. According to local historians, Chiefs Kombo-Kiboto and Maï-Munene exchanged gifts of cloth at funerals as equals. However, when Kombo had a good number of young men mature to fighting age, he began to dream of establishing his superiority. Kombo rebuilt his official residence (kibulu) and mounted a statue on the roof (ikishikishi) in female form, which he named "Katshina," ensuring that the work would be interpreted as a portrait of Mai's wife. His furious rival took Kombo's gesture to be a death threat targeting his wife (who was Kombo's niece) and an act of war. Kombo deliberately provoked Mai to attack so that his people would have no other option but This essay explores the cultural meanings of style in power objects. It draws on extensive field interviews conducted in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Jan. 1987-Sept. 1989, Dec. 2006 Jan. 2007). The subject presents distinct methodological challenges in a context where few believe that knowledge is objective or disinterested. Inspired by Jeanne Favret-Saada's extraordinary work on witchcraft in France, 1969-1975 (1980), I have narrated how my own understanding of events changed along with the personal relationships that gave me access to certain levels of exegesis. For a more detailed statement on methodology, see Strother 2000:68-70. I thank Francesco Pellizzi for inviting me to present an early version, "A Terrifying Mimesis," at the University Seminar, Columbia University, Oct. 4, 2007. He and audience members offered important feedback on that occasion, as did Wilfried van Damme, Jonathan M. Reynolds, Costa Petridis, and Lesley Sharp. The author provided all translations unless otherwise identified. to fight. However, the dead were not so easily fooled, and awarded Kombo a pyrrhic victory that brought shame on him and devastation to the community. The origin story for the kishikishi (as told in the late 1980s) was an allegory pitting the chief against his people and their best interests. Kombo used the portrait to threaten, to manipulate, and to make a bid to transform a ritual position into a political base for power.' Pende chieftaincy was once a ritual office. The chief was first and foremost a priest serving as intermediary between the living and the dead. His house is described as the "house of the dead," "the house of seed," "the house of meat," because it safeguards the portal through which the dead can send children, bountiful harvests, and successful hunts to their junior relatives. With investiture, he becomes the head of his clan, for which he serves as mediator and nurturer (mubambi, lit. "babysitter"). In the social contract with his people, the chief is awarded prestige, multiple wives, tribute, and extra food, but he must never seek after political power. Decisions should be reached through consensus of the "maternal uncles" (malemba), the elders of the various branches of the family. During the colonial period, the Belgians hated this model of chieftaincy (when they understood it) and tried their best to transform chiefs by appointing their own candidates who were willing to serve as political actors and colonial lackeys. Few 1. I do not believe in a single origin for the sculpted chief's house but am interested in the mythic content of the narrative. For a history and comprehensive analysis of the chiefs house, see Strother 2004. After a number of chiefs acquired the right to display sculptures in the 1970s, the practice grew contentious in the late 1980s when nearly all chiefs were barred from mounting carvings of any kind. However, there has been a renaissance of kibulu ornament since the fall of the Mobutu regime in 1997. Nonetheless, in 2005 to 2006, the rumor mill accused an Eastern Pende chief of mounting a portrait of his younger sister on his house. Many acquaintances sought pretexts to see it for themselves. As reported, "Everyone who passed said that the woman who had died was in fact the one [portrayed] on the door panel." No one tells the story without mentioning that the chief in question is known for his hunger for diamonds. As in the origin story, the mounting of portraits is always evidence of a flawed character.</page><page sequence="3">130 RES 65/66 2014/2015 Figure 2.

Strother. men today aspire to become chief and some of those who do so are inspired by the dictatorial model of Mobutu Sese Seko, who ruled from 1965 to 1997. This article relates contemporary practice when tensions between chiefs and their people have been exacerbated through the experiences of the colonial and Mobutu regimes. Nevertheless, several historians have argued that opposition to centralized authority is a deep-rooted cultural trait that may be documented over several centuries (Kodi 1976: 1: 164-165; Sikitele 1986: 1 : 118).2 Certainly, Pende thwarted the development of large chieftaincies, and resistance to Belgian interference in the election of chiefs contributed to the Pende Rebellion of 1931. 2. The noted historian Sikitele writes that the situation can become so extreme that "all political life in certain chiefdoms boils down ... to the contestation of power of the paramount chief" (1986: 1: 118). The social contract articulates an ideal relationship between a chief and his people but Pende ritual, history, and popular culture are full of stories of men who attempted—and failed—to establish political ascendency. The mythic content of struggle between Kombo and Maï turns on this question. A certain degree of naturalism is tolerated in kibulu sculpture. Nevertheless, to the present, the perception of portraiture is unwelcome and has even been known to provoke riots when conditions are volatile because it signals the chief's embrace of a political model of chieftaincy. Pende measure naturalism with a fine gauge. Sculptors are adamant, unanimous, that "masks do not represent" (that is, resemble a living being). Figurative sculpture is particularly contentious and reserved without exception for chiefs—once only a handful of the highest ranking chiefs (mafumu a mbandji). In her discussion of Olmec realism, Esther Pasztory articulated the "bag of artistic tricks" used in naturalism:</page><page sequence="4">Strother: A terrifying mimesis 131 Conceptual art focuses on the denotative features of the face—the eyes, nose, and mouth—but however detailed they are, they remain abstract if the intervening areas are not developed. The illusion of reality is created by modulating and developing the "insignificant" intermediate areas of the cheeks and eye sockets and situating the features within them. (Pasztory 2005:186) Pende chiefs' sculpture may be anthropomorphic and modeled, as Pasztory described, to give the impression of soft flesh. Part of the illusion involved is the creation of a full three-dimensional figure rather than busts or "cephalomorphic posts," which are by nature more abstract or "conceptual" because of their fragmentary form. However, no matter how naturalistic, sculpture in wood or metal must never resemble (kufezekesa) a named individual, living or dead. Viewers nervously police the border between naturalism and portraiture. Models for mimesis It is easy to misinterpret why so many Pende find mimesis in sculpture to be cause for anxiety. Stephen Halliwell has argued that the "history of mimesis is the record of a set of debates" about the degree to which art making should be "'world-reflecting'. . . (for which the 'mirror' has been a common though far from straightforward metaphorical emblem)" or an "imaginary world-in-itself, which may resemble or remind us of the real world in certain respects" but is to be judged on its own terms (2002:23).3 And yet, there is a third paradigm for mimesis in the European tradition, called witchcraft. In this world-changing practice, the copy, the portrait, the double shares in or siphons off power from its model. What Michael Taussig calls "the magical power of replication, the image affecting what it is an image of" (1993:2), is characteristic of one of the oldest ritual practices in European history, extending in an unbroken chain from ancient Mesopotamia, through ancient Greece and Rome, up to the present (Betz 1992; De Meûter and Poriau 1995; Faraone and Obbink 1991; Gager 1992).4 However, in the nineteenth century, the 3. T. W. Adorno gives voice to the latter position when he argues that the work of art should allow us to see things differently without attempting to offer a blueprint for the future; it is the "antithesis of that which is the case" (1977:159). 4. The number of references in American popular culture is staggering, including films, television shows, and board games. In one "get well" card drawn by Nick Downent for Hallmark, a doctor manipulates a doll full of pins as he asks a patient on the phone: "There. How's the sciatica now, Mrs. Pierce?" The implication is that he is causing the pain he is claiming to palliate. model of mimesis as a representational practice intended to influence (usually harm) its subject developed an artistic and scholarly literature for the first time—just as the practice of witchcraft itself began to wane. In "The Oval Portrait" from 1845, Edgar Allan Poe recounts how an obsessive artist could not rest until he had captured a perfect "life-likeness" of his young bride. She grew progressively weaker as he worked: "And he would not see that the tints which he spread upon the canvas were drawn from the cheeks of her who sate beside him [sic]." When he finished, crowing, "This is indeed Life itself!," he turned to discover his beloved dead.5 In his horror story, Poe transformed the artist into an unwitting warlock, drawing on received wisdom about European witchcraft. In his influential study of folklore in Scotland, James Napier wrote: It is a very old belief that those who had made compacts with the devil could afflict those they disliked with certain diseases, and even cause their death, by making images in clay or wax of the persons they wished to injure, and then, by baptizing these images with mock ceremony, the persons represented were brought under their influence, so that whatever was then done to the image was felt by the living original. (Napier 1879:77) The purported influence of the image on its subject in European witchcraft also became the source for scholars of nascent anthropology and prehistory to explain everything from the fetish (Lubbock 1871:164—165) to the cave paintings of Altamira (Reinach 1903:260). In 1914, Otto Rank (1971 [1914]) reviewed the by then rich literature on the "double" in literature, theatre, and ethnography for evidence of psychological evolution. Responding to his protégé's work, Sigmund Freud developed his oft-quoted formulation that while a belief in doubles may once have served as "insurance against the destruction of the ego" (as Rank argued), the "'double' has become a thing of terror, just as, after the collapse of their religion, the gods turned into demons" (Freud 1955 [1919]:234-235). Although Napier attributed efficacy in the maker's mind to his or her pact with the devil by which a victim was identified through the ritual naming (baptism) of a crude image, some writers began to claim that verisimilitude itself held magical powers. The cartographer and armchair anthropologist 5. Edgar Allan Poe, "The Oval Portrait," The Broadway journal, April 26, 1845, pp. 264-265. Oscar Wilde was inspired by this story to develop his novella The Picture of Dorian Cray (1890).</page><page sequence="5">132 RES 65/66 2014/2015 Richard Andree coined the phrase, "a [p]ortrait steals the soul" (Bildnis raubt die Seele), which became "a photo steals the soul," when the camera displaced the painter as the chief means for making portraits. As he explained in his influential compendium, Ethnographische Parallelen und Vergleiche: The fear to let oneself be drawn, which is widespread among many peoples, is connected to sympathetic magic and underlies similar beliefs. The savage dominates his enemy's body and soul if he can obtain a few hair- or nail cuttings from this individual; he burns them and thereby destroys his enemy. Such is also the case with portraiture [Bildnis], which seizes part of the life force [Kraft] or even the soul of the original and which is understood as an incarnate alter ego for the person represented. (Andree 1889:18) Andree was inspired by nineteenth-century reports that people around the world (including Europe) sometimes refused to have their portraits made. On the basis of no hard evidence whatsoever, he surmised that "primitive peoples" believed that the act of portraiture could siphon off the life of its subject (as Poe represented).6 James George Frazer's The Golden Bough was an important motor of diffusion for Andree's ideas (1890, 1911:96 100). Rather than invoke benighted superstition, David Freedberg has argued that humans universally (innately) respond to images as though they were living beings. The greater the perceived likeness, as in European waxworks, the greater the possibility that they will provoke a negative reaction: "We fear the lifelike because the dead substance of which the object is made may yet come alive" (Freedberg 1989:231). Beginning in the 1980s, naturalism drew a new form of analysis—one that viewed it as a tool for political mystification. Critics were responding to decades of modernist rejection of the "world-reflecting" mission of mimesis and its truth claims. In her elegant analysis of Orientalist painting, Linda Nochlin drew on Leo Bersani and Roland Barthes to argue that strategies for downplaying the hand of the artist and multiplying "authenticating details" were designed to seduce the viewer into believing in the reality of what was represented as a product of "artless reflection" (Nochlin 1983:122-123). Naturalism, in other words, was a tool for deceit. 6. For analysis of Andree, his arguments, and their impact, see Strother 2013:178-185. Taussig remarks that most scholars are disappointed to observe the schematic nature of images intended to influence their subjects; as Marcel Mauss and Henri Hubert state: "There is nothing resembling a portrait" (Taussig 2003:51-52). Given a literature that ranges from Edgar Allan Poe to Oscar Wilde, Frazer to Taussig, Freud to Freedberg, it is hard to look at the Pende case with fresh eyes. Freedberg could easily cite Pende anxiety about figuration in his catalogue of universal human response to images, and it is not exaggerated (in some cases) to invoke a Freudian "terror of the double." Nonetheless, I will argue that the political model of mystification comes closest to matching Pende theory (and distrust) of naturalism. "It cost too much." The history of an Eastern Pende power object masquerading as an altar will convey the dynamics of rumor and display through which visual forms accrue different and sometimes contradictory meanings. I met Chief Kanyama in February 1987 while traveling in Zaïre (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) to select a base for research.7 In front of his ritual house, he had a statue buried up to its upper chest. The chief explained that the sculpture (kisongo) was nine years old and had once taken the form of a fully modeled female figure, with fingers and toes, tinted red and with black hair and eyebrows (fig. 3). It stood with arms pressed to its sides, hands resting on the abdomen. He had needed to keep burying it to make it stand upright as termites consumed it from the ground up. I already knew enough to realize that it was rare for a chief to have three-dimensional statuary out in the open for fear of theft. Since I had met a runner only the day before searching for works of art to purchase, I counseled Kanyama to demand a reasonable price, should he decide to sell it. He told me, "Oh, I would never sell it. It cost too much." I filed his comment away, intending one day to find out how much he had paid the sculptor when we knew each other better. Over the next couple of months, when I asked people about works of art in the region, Kanyama's statue always appeared on the list. A number of people whispered that he had "sacrificed" a niece to "strengthen" the statue {kisongo). A few even said that he had taken the life of his daughter. Since I was aware that chiefs were surrounded by rumors of sorcery, I impatiently brushed aside these suspicions. It was clear that Kanyama was a well-meaning individual, who sought the best for his community and who was a caring and engaged father. In July, the boys' initiation (mukanda) opened and the paramount chief assigned me to live with Chief 7. I have changed the name of Kanyama and his wife.</page><page sequence="6">Strother: A terrifying mimesis 133 shortly thereafter. Kanyama spoke often, regretfully, about this daughter. His wife never once mentioned her directly although she sometimes gave Kanyama a tongue-lashing (after a beer or two) for not having given her a daughter. He would wail: "What can I do?" The Pende are matrilineal and not having a daughter means that one's lineage is "dead," mortgaged without a future. Some families force women who fail to have a daughter with one husband to divorce and remarry. In this case, Nzeba's family gambled on her sister, who had a single daughter, but one girl is a precarious thread for a lineage. The chief's wife takes a special name when she is invested into office with her husband. Nzeba took the name "Vungisa," which means "To turn a blind eye." I was puzzled by her choice but she explained that she must not pay any attention to the criticism that she hears of her husband as chief. This is not at all the typical usage of the word, which is pejorative and usually applies to adolescent babysitters who pretend not to notice when their charges get into trouble. In September, the paramount chief in the region died and left word that I was to follow the investiture of his successor. During this six-month process, I was still based at Kanyama's and the whole process unleashed a flood of memories in my host about his own investiture (as it did for the parade of chiefs who visited), all very useful for me. The candidate goes through a long seclusion after his Figure 3. A power object masquerading as an altar. The fact election.

Either he purchases a protective medicine ready-made (as Kombo was attempting to do), which he may bury under his door or keep on his person, or he seeks to become a sorcerer himself. Nzambi told me that he had traveled to another province to buy medicines, which had been effective up to the present. In November, a Luba runner asked Kanyama to sell his statue. He refused. When he gave me the news, he revealed that he had taken the spirit (kivule) of a niece to reinforce (kukolesa) the statue and the resulting loss of life was why "it cost too much" to sell. Now that I had experienced firsthand the pressures on candidates during their seclusion, he hoped that I would be able to understand why he had turned to sorcery without judging him too harshly. Seven months later: The missing daughter In June 1988, Kanyama was going blind (probably from river blindness). He had brought in a diviner from the Chokwe who told him that he had been bewitched by his maternal uncles but that he should rebuild his house and the altars in the village, pretending to believe that his illness had been sent by the dead, while he worked to placate his uncles. At this point, Kanyama came to me and asked if I would like to have the statue as a present. I was astounded: "I thought you said that you would never part with it?!" He explained that when the chief's ritual house was replaced, all the associated altars and power objects were automatically decommissioned and the spirits freed as the works decayed. Hitherto, I had been careful not to acquire anything, partly because I was on foot, partly because I did not want my reputation as a student to become confused with that of a dealer or runner. However, here was a work with a unique provenance. Furthermore, it was an opportunity to give Kanyama a large sum of money. I was concerned about his growing blindness as the father of ten children and so responded that it was too valuable to give me as a present, but I would buy it, if he promised 8. In Kipende, nganga is a pejorative term when used without a qualifier, often signifying "criminal sorcerer." When qualified by reference to a body of knowledge, it becomes a neutral term for "specialist in .. .For example, nganga mukanda means "circumciser"; nganga mbua, "master hunter." to go see the one ophthalmologist in all of Zaïre, based at the Baptist Mission of Vanga, many miles distant on the Zaïre River. He was delighted with this arrangement. As we discussed the fate of the statue, Kanyama confessed that he had empowered it with the life of his baby daughter, not with the life of a niece. He recounted how terrified he had been in seclusion, well aware of the resentment and jealousy of his rivals. He knew that he needed a power object to protect himself and his family but he was caught in a terrible quandary because he did not have a single niece or nephew whose spirit he might take for use as an otherworldly bodyguard. He had several brothers but only one classificatory sister and so it was out of the question for him to take her life.9 His young bride shared his intense loneliness. She was young and strong and had conceived easily. Judging from their relationship ten years later, I would guess that she was also very much in love with him. She gave birth the month after he entered seclusion and, given the extraordinary circumstances, granted permission to Kanyama to take her daughter's life for the greater good. Frequently, when a child dies, people accuse the maternal uncles, who are said to "own" their sisters' progeny. The kind of plot that Kanyama described between a father and mother to ensorcell their child was shocking, so much so that Kanyama could not at first admit to it, claiming instead to have struck a (nonexistent) niece. He took some relief in being able to talk to someone about it. As he explained, once he had his wife's permission, his advisors hired a blacksmith who also had a reputation as a nganga (someone who made power objects). All they knew was that he had asked to carve the work in the presence of the baby. He worked on it for three days while looking at the daughter. On the third day, they planted the statue around six p.m. The baby died about a week later, suddenly, without being sick. There was no particular outcry since the rate of infant mortality is high. After his investiture, Kanyama made a show of doing what was normal, that is, placating his wife's maternal uncles, whom most people blamed for the child's death. 9. If a chief has a single power object, he will usually seek to reinforce it through the spirit (kivule) of a female relative. Women are believed to make the best bodyguards because Pende gender theory maintains that they are fiercely protective of their families and have greater powers of concentration than men. However, the cost of losing a female relative is so high that the chief's guardians also hope that the troubling experience will dissuade him from ever turning to sorcery again.</page><page sequence="8">Strother: A terrifying mimesis 135 Two weeks after our conversation, when the new house was being roofed, Kanyama joined me at dinner and sent a friend to pull out the statue. When he brought it into the living room, Kanyama called out to the spirit in the statue, saying: "Do not look at him resentfully; he is only the messenger."10 Blind as he was, Kanyama held the carving in both his hands and spoke to his daughter directly: I did not give you [take your life] for no reason. I have already arranged for your replacement. Me, I am your father. I am your mother. Mama Nzeba, her name in the chieftaincy is "Turn a blind eye." I take responsibility; I had the right. "A thief is a slave, but a buyer is chief." [In other words, Kanyama had secured permission from the girl's rightful owner. One may punish a thief but never an honest purchaser.] Go in peace. May you go where she hopes to take you." He closed with the blessing that fathers give to their children before they leave home: "Go with clear eyes and a light step. May life's impediments smooth out before you."12 Through his speech, the meaning of Kanyama's wife's adoption of the curious epithet "Turn a blind eye" finally became clear; she had looked the other way, allowing harm to come to her daughter. However, Kanyama took responsibility for what had happened. The next morning he told me that he had not been able to sleep with the statue in the house. It would have to leave immediately. He also announced that he would content himself henceforth with a customary house altar and would not be replacing the figure with another power object. I eventually took the statue home, and keep it out of sight in a box in my office so that it cannot inadvertently trigger uneasy memories. A power object masquerading as an altar Kanyama's statue stood before his house in the place of a lupepe altar where chiefs petition the dead to send good harvests and to watch over the health of their descendants. However, from the beginning, I picked up rumors that the carving was a statue (kisongo), rather 10. "Umutaloko kithedi, udi kendji mutsumiwa." 11. "Ngetshia kulaba kukuhanako. Ngahete kaie pandji'aye wa kuserigunuka. Eme, sh'aye. Eme, kin'aye. Mama [name withheld], [jina] dia mu ufumu, 'Vungisa.' Ame, ngakuhana nu koko ku'ami. 'Zangi, muhika; musumbi, fumu.' Uye kiakiloshi. Uhetefundo adifuelela kukutshuala." 12. "Ku meso pe, ku malo lelu. Isasa nu ibundji ikotome." than an altar. Furthermore, many people suspected that the statue had been "strengthened" by someone's spirit, presumably that of a niece. The choice of words was significant. Sometimes people describe a paramount chief "strengthening the chieftaincy" (kukolesa ufumu) when he mounts sculpture on his kibulu (fig. 1). The terminology makes clear that he has acted for the benefit of the community. To say instead that someone has "strengthened a statue" (kukolesa kisongo) (rather than the chieftaincy) is to accuse him of seeking wanga for his own private ends. How did they know? As mentioned at the beginning, every chief, no matter his rank, is first and foremost a priest who serves the community as an intermediary between the living and the dead. One of his primary responsibilities is the maintenance of altars, which are used to convey prayers to the dead. Altars are located in public spaces and pose no danger to the uninitiated. Most take the form of tree trunks or "cephalomorphic posts."13 These posts have one or two rudimentary faces (figs. 4-5). Otherwise, the cylinder of the tree branch is respected and often the bark itself is left on the bottom. If there is a single face, it will be marked female through the representation of half-closed or zanze eyes, the gaze of femininity and generosity, which conveys a visual prayer for nurture and protection from the dead. Kanyama's statue was positioned facing his house in the place of an altar, with a feminine gaze, but the fully modeled three-dimensional form warned onlookers that the work was more than an altar, which is never strengthened with more than chicken's blood to help it resist the elements. Kanyama had a good reputation and was not someone previously accused of sorcery. The rumors that I had collected speculating about which human life he had taken indicated that observers recognized the statue as a power object (wanga) by the naturalism of its form. The statue stood where an altar should be but advertised that it was a power object masquerading as an altar. The subterfuge was necessary because Kanyama was not of a rank to own power objects, much less display them. High-ranking chiefs exhibit power objects with the goal of deterring individuals from harming those under their care. Therefore, there is little point in procuring a protective power object if no one knows that you have one. Kanyama's advisors gambled—correctly—that the adjutant for the paramount chief would pretend not to 13. The term "cephalomorphic posts" belongs to C. Petridis, who surveys their importance on the southern savanna (1999:138-145).</page><page sequence="9">136 RES 65/66 2014/2015 Figure 4.

Significantly, when Kanyama rebuilt his house, he replaced the power object with a conventional altar post (figs. 3, 6). Although he hired the same artist, a connoisseur would never be able to discern that the same hand carved both figures. The handling of the face and head on the altar post is much more geometricized (contrast, for instance, the difference in the modeling of the mouth or the jaw line). The hairstyle is imaginary. Most importantly, the artist has only modeled the head and neck and left the trunk below untouched. The second work is indisputably an altar post and has never been suspected of being anything else. Do Africans make portraits? A debate has raged for a century about whether or not Africans made portraits before the advent of photography. A 1910 handbook for the British Museum praised the Bushoong (Kuba) for their "remarkable . . . art of portraiture" and reproduced a "Contemporary portrait-figure" representing a named king dated around 1 790 (British Museum 1910:222 and pi. 11). The Bushoong king figures became a touchstone for all future discussions. Carl Einstein strongly advocated for portraiture: "Based on this preconception that Negro art is just a primitive art, treating only impersonal types, 1 HI * ► 1 % J0-J* M ■** w 3£33« gjr ■HL W~*W ,^m Mgr liflic ■ ,«%v Figure 5.

He also argued that the artist "treats the individual portrait exactly like a magical representation" (Einstein 1922:15-16), a remark that he does not explain but which alludes to Pierre Colle, one of his principal sources.

He postulated that some were carved from life (such as the first Bushoong statue), some from memory, and some took the form of symbolic representation (such as a totem). "Depending on how strong the memory of the defunct is, the image of the ancestor has more or less value as a portrait" (14-15). In Afrikanische Plastik, Einstein was responding to reviews of his first book on African art, Negerplastik, which called for more art history. The topic of portraiture seemed to offer a means to address the critics' concerns. Einstein was in a minority. Most writers conflated portraiture with naturalism and naturalism with bourgeois individualism. According to G.-D. Périer, the "tendency toward portraiture" in Bushoong statues was almost unique in Congolese art since "one must arrive at a superior degree of civilization for the question of individuality to emerge" (1948:55). Art historian Douglas Fraser mocked claims that "primitive carvers could have carved naturalistic portraits 'if they had wanted to.' This is like arguing that elephants can really fly—but just do not want to." For Fraser, the "primitive artist" was uninterested in "specific human beings" because he was not a humanist (1962:24-25). In a recent exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Alisa LaGamma fought to rebut a continuing resistance on the part of the public to accept that African art often celebrates historical individuals, whether or not the artists sought to achieve physiognomic likeness (2011 ). Citing examples from both Europe and Africa, Jean Laude warned that the term "portrait" raises expectations Figure 6.

The carvers anchored resemblance in facial contour, proportional relationships, and the shape of some distinctive feature (lips, nose, eyebrows, etc.) (1984 [1969]). Possibly in response to the doubts expressed by Fraser, Himmelheber devised an imaginative experiment to test "how much resemblance could be achieved [by the African sculptor]" (1972:305-306). He commissioned four sculptors (one Senufo, two Baule, and one Dan) to make portrait masks with himself as model. The Senufo carver (who did not belong to a tradition with portrait masks) achieved an astonishing degree of verisimilitude, to the point that Himmelheber suspected some familiarity with European models (305). The others produced recognizable likenesses although very much conditioned by local and personal styles.15 Scholars have amply demonstrated that portraiture, as the representation of named, historical individuals, plays an important role in African art history. However, we must now build on Borgatti's insights (1990a) to disengage discussion of portraiture from that of iliusionism and resemblance. As was common in Central Africa, Pende have always commemorated individuals but by reference to their achievements, not their evanescent physical shell, subject as it is to age, environment, and mood. For example, named chiefs will be represented by long-lived trees (Chlorophora excelsa). The lofty and straight-trunked monument speaks to the characteristics admired in a dedicated chief. Or an uncle might be honored when his nephew dances a mask that he loved to perform. Conversely, some of the most haunting songs recall historical figures as men of promise who brought disaster on themselves (like Kombo in the opening story) through overweening ambition. Photography introduced a new kind of portraiture to Pende country, and the ability of skilled photographers to produce an idealizing physiognomic resemblance 15. Himmelheber acknowledged that some artists feared to make portraits, citing a Guro sculptor who said that he would "not dare" to model the head of a heddle pulley after a particular person because he would be blamed if something happened soon afterward to his subject. Himmelheber compared the sculptor to Germans in the Black Forest who once dared not hang a photographic portrait of anyone living in their parlor for the same reason (1972:261). Although the ethnologist certainly demonstrated that portraits depicting living people existed in Côte d'Ivoire in the mid-twentieth century, he never asked when and under what conditions they might be desirable. is much admired.16 And yet, many abhor the same illusionism in sculpture. Why? Mimesis in two and three dimensions Without question, the most in-depth discussion of African conceptions of naturalism is situated in the Yoruba literature. In what became a foundational essay for African art history, Robert Farris Thompson contrasted the paradigmatic fable of the Greek artist Zeuxis, who painted grapes in such an illusionistic fashion that birds began to peck at them, with a Yoruba tale about monkeys who were curious about but soon bored by figures bearing a "strong resemblance" to their subject (Thompson 1973:31). Through interviews with twenty critics, Thompson concluded that Yoruba sculptors sought "to strike through the individual personality of men and women to arrive at general principles of humanity" (32). In other words, in response to Fraser, Thompson maintained that the Yoruba were humanists, too much so to be advocates for illusionism: Light touches of portraiture (hair, scars, dress) redress the balance in favor of individuality, yet not to the degree where even the vilest monkey cannot distinguish likeness from equivalence. Mimesis to modern traditional Yoruba means the cultivated expression of resemblances ([jfjora), not likenesses. It is "midpoint mimesis" between absolute abstraction and absolute likeness. (32) Thompson's methods have been questioned (Hallen 2000), but his conclusions have won broad support. Although Yoruba fashioned sculptures to honor named individuals (such as deceased twins), Babatunde Lawal agrees that "many Yoruba treated the naturalistic representation of a living person with ambivalence." He attributes this to certain religious beliefs that illusionistic portraiture might confuse an individual's spirit-partner in the other world or might serve as a surrogate in sorcery either to protect or to harm the model (Lawal 2001:503). Lawal's latter examples come the closest to the prototypes cited for European witchcraft; however, it is unclear what role resemblance plays in the process since he writes that "frequently" the patient will need to drink some herbal mixture or wear an amulet "to link the portrait with the portrayed" (523, n.42) or that the subject's name or an article that has touched 16. Central Pende refer to drawings, engraved illustrations of Bible stories, and photographs as gifuanesa (pi. ifuanesa), "something that resembles [something else]."</page><page sequence="12">Strother: A terrifying mimesis 139 his or her body may substitute for "physical likeness" (503).17 Evidently, as was true in Scotland, more than resemblance was required to insure efficacy. There was a startling exception in Yoruba sculptural history: Ako (life-size mannequins) once fashioned for second-burial ceremonies of prominent men and women in Öwö (Lawal 2001:503). These portraits achieved an uncanny illusionism although they always depicted the defunct as strong and middle-aged, not in the sad state of his or her passing. According to Rowland Abfodun, Ako allowed the deceased to appear one last time in a physical form. "Hereafter, they are seen neither with the 'ordinary eyes' . . . nor under normal circumstances. They may, however, be seen in dreams and in the next world of immortality" (Abfodun 2013:354). The brief reappearance of the deceased in his or her familiar form helped to create a warm atmosphere for the living to say good-bye; today photographs are used instead. Lawal implies that there is no difference in the reception of resemblance in two- and three-dimensional representations. Practice indicates otherwise. Certainly, it is convincing that Yoruba once strove to achieve what Thompson calls "midpoint mimesis" in their photographic portraits by adopting symmetrical and frontal poses, by erasing as many signs of age and mood as possible, by taking care to show their fingers and toes, and so on (Sprague 1978; Abfodun 2013). As Thompson outlined, some of these portraits aspire to "strike through" individual idiosyncrasy and reveal the noble human archetype. People may once have imitated the sublime perfection of sculptures; however, it seems to have been much more problematic for artists to pursue human likenesses in fully modeled sculpture. The Ako images could only be so lifelike because their subjects were dead. Historically, around the world, sculpture has been far more likely to become a target for iconoclasm than two-dimensional art forms. The Protestant Reformation is a well-documented case. After a fierce period of reform, most Protestants accepted stained glass windows and a limited range of imagery in their churches whereas Catholic sanctuaries still embrace sculpture in the round. The difference is encapsulated in the contrast of the flat Protestant cross with the fully modeled Catholic crucifix. Interestingly, the distinction is seldom articulated. There 17. Similarly, memorial portraits intended for shrines usually require a naming ceremony that may involve the figure being rubbed with soil from the grave of the deceased or bathed with water used to prepare the body for burial (Lawal 2001:511). seems only to be an inchoate feeling that sculpture is more likely to confuse or even deceive viewers because it occupies space in the same way as a living being. Schooled by the Western tradition, Freedberg maintains that verisimilitude increases the "lifelikeness" of inert materials, which triggers a wide range of emotions from spectators, ranging from desire to fear and anger (1989). Pende sculptors and ritual specialists argue things differently. The photographic portrait is innocent because it is printed on a fragile, two-dimensional, paper medium.18 Sculpture is another matter since it may serve as a container for a human spirit in the same way that the body does. This issue becomes acute for power objects in Central Africa, which, by definition, are containers of animate energy dedicated toward the accomplishment of a specific task. In Kanyama's case, his daughter's spirit was given the assignment of serving as a watchful bodyguard over the chief. The kishikishi on the roof are often justified as sentinels securing the borders of the community. The spirit's indenture is temporary. Power objects are made quite deliberately from ephemeral materials of moderate duration. Like a body of flesh, a carving or gourd or bundle of cloth will decay and release the spirit within to continue its journey to the other world. In Kipende, one says that it dies (kufua). Most chiefs do not say farewell to their indentured spirits as Kanyama did. His was an exceptional circumstance as he felt a bond with his daughter and wished to accelerate the process of her separation from the sculpture. Many worry that spirits are angry about their servitude, even though its duration is limited. Kanyama was concerned to protect me and the friend who unearthed the statue from harm. By far, most Central African power objects take the form of a handful of medicines tied up in a small bundle. A representational form is never required, only a container of some sort.19 The average person does not admit to owning power objects and is concerned to have something that can be hidden easily. Periodically, every ten to twenty years, iconoclastic movements 18. Photos in the countryside tend to have a short life for both social and environmental reasons.

Apart from bundles and small vessels, they sometimes uncover crude miniatures. From 1980 to 1984, the iconoclast Manesa exhibited and then burned a host of miniature planes, cars, rifles, and masqueraders. He accused criminal sorcerers (nganga) of making maquettes to enlarge as needed. In folklore, sorcerers have modernized their mode of transportation, preferring to travel by airplane, when they once had assumed the form of eagles to strike at victims from a distance. In 1987, Pende Mennonites were holding a prayer meeting near Kitangua when one of their members felt the presence of a malevolent force. He ran outside and tackled something. The others found him dazed, grasping a small, crude figure (fig. 7). Only four and a half inches tall, the statuette had a blocked-out head and short legs with feet. It was dressed in raffia with mock coins attached. Most striking, it had human hair glued to the surface of the head. The members of the prayer meeting and the ritual specialists I consulted afterward were unanimous that the figure was a small robot named after a Kindombolo mask (hence the raffia ruff), which criminal sorcerers could enlarge and animate to strike small children.20 Although the hair might have belonged to an intended victim, it functioned like an item of clothing given to a bloodhound to sniff out its prey.21 It is critical to stress that the miniature does not represent the victim, as would have been the case in European witchcraft. Pende specialists eschew the act of representation. They insist that the sorcerer does not make an image; he makes the thing itself (and enlarges it for use later).22 20. Kindombolo is a humorous mask numbered among the mahamba (tools used to petition the dead for harvests and children). According to Pende ethics, sorcery (wanga) seldom invents anything new. Instead, it functions by perverting what is good and normal. 21. According to Mukishi Loange and Kakoko (two of the most renowned nganga of the late 1980s), these maquettes must be fueled with "gasoline" in order to run. While the vast majority of recipes involving wanga require no more than a spark of energy from chicken's blood to take effect, the maquette of an airplane or robotic mask requires a human spirit to function (like the kisongo of Kanyama). According to Kakoko, the nganga will go "fishing" (kulowa) in the cemetery to extract a relic from someone's grave. He surmised that the gummy accumulations on the top of the head and the chest of figure 7 contained grave dirt and other medicines to fix the spirit and instruct it on its duties. 22.

Mystification Let us return to the question of naturalism in chiefs' sculptures where image making comes into play. The blacksmith asked to work from life on Kanyama's statue, but there never was any suggestion that his carving served as a "portrait" of the baby whose spirit it was intended to house. If it had, Kanyama's in-laws would have demanded a trial and there would have been an ugly, volatile public discussion that would have permanently tarnished the chief's reputation and made his wife into a pariah. The relative naturalism of sculpture in the round raised the possibility of spiritual reinforcement but consigned it to the realm of rumor and speculation. The rationale was that someone with a guilty conscience, looking for clues about the community's defenses, would know what it signified.</page><page sequence="14">Strother: A terrifying mimesis 141 Until recently, only paramount chiefs (mafumu a mbandji) had the right to display figurative sculpture and always in a context of ambiguity. Local interpretations of the kishikishi will illustrate this point. They have taken a wide variety of forms over the course of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The motif of a female figure holding a kuba (an axe with rounded blade) is one of the oldest (fig. 2). In the culminating rite of investiture for paramount chiefs, the candidate will use the kuba to behead a ram with a single blow. Therefore, the axe reminds everyone that the dead accepted the candidacy of the incumbent and underscores the elite rank of the chieftaincy. Moreover, according to Chief Mudinga (Kamusa Albert), the axe shows that "we inherited our chieftaincy through the maternal line."23 In other words, it is legitimate and should not be disputed. Mudinga's advisors interpreted the female statue as representing the chief himself as kin'athu, "the mother of the clan." By this interpretation, the form of the statue reminds the chief of the nurturing role he should play in the community. In another variant, the female figure holds a cup (with or without an axe), which was frequently interpreted as representing Tembo, the handmaiden who goes through the investiture process with the chief. Tembo keeps the candidate chaste during his seclusion (by acting as an ever-present chaperone). She rubs his skin with red cosmetic bark lotion from the cup and dances with the axe before passing it to him for his test in beheading the ram. The depiction of Tembo again confirms the investiture of the incumbent and reminds the community of the responsibilities that they owe the chief to care and watch over him. In the 1940s, KaseyaTambwe Makumbi from Kandolo-Mututua (Njila) (d. 1985?) invented a new model depicting a mother holding a child over her left hip, which was probably inspired by Catholic statues of the Virgin Mary with the Christ child (figs. 1, 9).24 He greatly increased the illusionism of his figures with more naturalistic proportions and softer modeling. In particular, Kaseya intensified the gaze of his sculptures by making the eyes as realistic as possible—convex 23. "Ufumu w'etu udi muza gua mama." The Mudinga chieftaincy had recently split in two so the reference to inheritance was more than symbolic. The presence of the statue reinforced Kamusa Albert's claim to legitimacy. 24. In the mid-1950s, Agent Territorial Charles Souris attributed the pose of Kaseya's kishikishi to statues of the Madonna and Child (unidentified field notebook of anthropologist Léon de Sousberghe, p. 1 ). Souris was an art enthusiast who opened a museum of Eastern Pende art in Kitangua (which was also a large Catholic center). He knew Kaseya well. orbs with white irises and dark pupils fully visible under lowered lids. He also enhanced the youth and beauty of the figure by multiplying cicatrizations (especially in erogenous zones) and by adding various elements of jewelry. Kaseya's revolution in style and content pleased both his Pende and European clients. From the 1950s through the 1970s, he received commissions from the most respected Eastern Pende chiefs. He also became a protégé of Robert Verly, who made him one of the "chiefs" of his Ateliers sociaux d'Art indigène du Sud Kasaï (1956-1959), which maintained a small museum in Tshikapa for the encouragement of "native" art (Verly 1959). Verly's initiative encouraged the adaptation of local carving traditions to the European market even as it advertised its goal to "permit Congolese sculptors to pursue the evolution of the artistic traditions of their race, sheltered from foreign influences" (fig. 8).25 In a photo taken for the Belgian colonial news service, Kaseya poses in front of his studio, which was decorated for foreign clients quite extraordinarily with a rooftop statue modeled on a kishikishi, but representing a male sculptor, adze in hand (fig. 9).26 Pende tourists flocked to see Kaseya's kishikishi when chiefs mounted them on their ritual houses. The theme of mother and child may have been drawn from the Catholics but not for any connection to Christ. Instead, the addition of the child enriched existing commentaries. Chief Kingange (Kaluma a Mbangu) commissioned a work from Kaseya for his investiture in January 1960: "I am their mother, that's why I put it there. That's why it represents a mother and child: I gave birth to all the others." Kingange spoke as the head of the family (the lemba or maternal uncle) who is responsible for the progeny of all the women in the clan.27 Others stated that the chief was asked to live with the image of a 25. Label provided for the object by InforCongo. Increased naturalism in Central Pende masks is easily demonstrated during the course of the colonial occupation. Himmelheber documented interest by Chokwe carvers in naturalistic proportions in masks in the 1930s (1939:21-22, 29-31). He also noted their active participation in programs fostered by the Amis de l'Art Indigène, a group that also sponsored Verly. Despite their preservationist agenda, the "Friends" showered praise on artists who worked in more naturalistic idioms, like Kaseya or Madya (famous for his illusionistic engravings on calabashes). This market incentive no doubt encouraged artists who were already intrigued by European prototypes. 26. It is nothing short of astonishing that Kaseya should have been able to mount an anthropomorphic statue, a prerogative strongly policed by chiefs in the 1950s. Nothing shows better that Kaseya was closely identified with the colonial regime and therefore untouchable. 27. As a matter of etiquette, one addresses the mother's brother as "Mama."</page><page sequence="15">142 RES 65/66 2014/2015 woman cradling a child as an exhortation to remember that he should display the love and care of a mother to his people. The reading of the female figure as the chief himself is what may be said in public. Sotto voce, dozens of people voiced the opinion that the roof finial alluded to a niece whom the chief had bewitched to serve as his guardian. No chief will voice this interpretation of the statue although they acknowledge (privately) that a paramount chief is expected to have one of his minions take at least one life through sorcery to serve as a guardian over the community. In theory, he is expected to take the life of a sister or niece from his own family for the kishikishi as a lesson never to use sorcery again. The painful loss of a young and potentially fertile woman is the greatest sacrifice because it entails the loss of an entire future lineage. What many Pende viewers find so compelling, and so dreadful, in the kishikishi depicting mother and child is the vaunted annihilation of an entire family line. The hyper-naturalism of Kaseya's style enhanced the reading of the dark side of power. As one eyewitness insisted for Kaseya's kishikishi for Kombo-Kiboto (Mukanzo Mbelenge), mounted in 1953, "It was a portrait! Everyone says that his work was portrait-like" (Strother 2004:figs. 2-3). Note the oscillation. Was it a portrait? Or was it "portrait-like"? In my experience, close female relatives seldom die around the time of investiture.28 Ambiguity is essential for the chief to maintain deniability. He must never lose his image as nurturer (mubambi). To a remarkable degree, this negotiation is carried out through the language of mimesis. The naturalism alludes to a human model without being precise enough to identify a particular individual. If he crosses that line, if the work becomes a portrait identifying a particular person (as in the origin story), the chief becomes a political actor seeking to establish an illegitimate regime through violence for his own personal ambitions. Thanks to the work of Arnold Rubin (1974), Wyatt MacGaffey (1988, 1993), and many others, we have come to acknowledge an aesthetic of accumulation designed to provoke "astonishment" and awe since it points to an energy reserve controlled by a specialist 28. My suspicion is that the perception of portraiture in kibulu sculpture (as recounted in note 1) follows the exceptional death of a close relative, rather than the reverse. The sudden death of the chiefs pregnant young sister predisposed people to find her features in the side door panel of his house, especially since the chief's character was already in doubt. -•' '-h* •'&lt; • • V A * &lt;y M W - -flV' «f1 JW Figure 8.

It is possible that admiration for aesthetic form led some Luba to a means to preserve the container for future generations. Nonetheless, the bundles nestled into the hair and other cavities confirmed that the reception of the work was one of awe and dread, which was only increased by a touch of illusionism. What role naturalism?

It is rare in Central Africa for power objects to be inherited, but the ease with which bundles could be removed and replaced may have facilitated the survival of admired sculptures serving as containers for spirit.

And yet, my interlocutors were adamant that naturalism itself accomplishes nothing. Instead, they described it as a tool for political mystification. As Mwaat Kombaan Mutomb (Kizema Kapata), an acute observer of Pende lore, snorted: "Chiefs mount kishikishi to say 'I am terrible.'" He described them as a form of advertising (publicité) that dissimulated the absence of any real political power. Others remarked resentfully that the chief displayed anthropomorphic sculptures in order to manipulate people by frightening them ("I kill people!") or, more positively, "to show that he has the guts to do what it takes (unzui)." The consensus was that chiefs deploy naturalistic carvings in a bid to trade ritual for political power. In the normal course of things, altar posts barely attract a glance from passersby. What the history of the power object masquerading as an altar demonstrates is that the very skill of naturalism commands the viewer's eye and makes it easier to believe that the chief has spiritual reinforcements. Whether that is true or not is something best not pinned down. REFERENCES Abfödün, Rowland 2013 "Àko-graphy: Öwö Portraits," in Portraiture and Photography in Africa, ed. J. Peffer and E. L.
