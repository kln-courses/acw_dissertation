Abstract: Songs and dances of the St. Lawrence Island Eskimos. The paper describes songs and dances of the St. Lawrence Island Eskimos as they were performed before 1900. It is based on the author's field research during two separate visits to the village of Gambell on St. Lawrence Island in 1980. It shows that dances were a vehicle for spiritual activities; they were also held for recreational or social entertainment purposes. Dances were also the product of certain perceptions and of an intimate knowledge of the surrounding world, especially animal biology and behavior. This paper describes songs and dances of the St. Lawrence Island Eskimos as they were performed before the turn of the century. It is based on my field research during two separate visits to the village of Gambell, on St. Lawrence Island, in 1980. My principal informants on St. Lawrence Island were Steven Aningaiyou, Lilly Apangalook, Lewis Iyakitan, and Estel Oosevaseuk. Both Aningaiyou and Iyakitan were whaling captains; Iyakitan was also an accomplished ivory carver. Oosevaseuk and Apangalook were both respected elders with deep knowledge of traditional sewing, skin preparation, and food preservation. All four of my main informants on St. Lawrence Island thus possessed the * Peabody Museum of Archeology and Anthropology, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. 02138, U.S.A.

All had personally witnessed most of the dances, costumes and songs described in this paper; other dances, songs and costumes which had disappeared from the culture before they were born had been described to them in detail by their parents and grandparents. My other principal informants included several former residents of St. Lawrence Island living on the mainland. Linda Womkon Badten, who was fluent in Siberian Yupik Eskimo, provided me with much valuable information on the history of the island, described many of the dances and traditional interior settings for the dances, and helped me transcribe and translate many of my notes, interviews, and recordings. Nick and Lucille Wongittilin, members of a small community of former St. Lawrence Island Eskimos living in Nome, also provided me with much valuable information, particularly descriptions of certain dances once performed by women during whale hunting festivals, but which had apparently long been forgotten by most current St. Lawrence Island residents. My research methods included formal interviews, the recording of songs, and observation of and personal participation in dance performances. I also regularly took part in a dance class taught by Lewis Iyakitan at the community high school on St. Lawrence Island. As mentioned earlier, several of my informants subsequently were of much assistance in translating and interpreting the material thus gathered. Hunters and gatherers Siberian Yupik Eskimos from St. Lawrence Island originally settled in villages along the coast of the island. Like their counterparts from mainland Siberia, Alaska, Canada and Greenland, they lived in tight symbiosis with the natural world. Chiefly hunters and gatherers, the islanders depended on animals: survival was ensured by a successful hunt. They also identified closely with animals. In order to survive, they had to use similar hunting techniques and similar strategies to protect themselves against an inhospitable environment and attacks by predators and enemies. Thus the hunting equipment and techniques used by Siberian Yupik Eskimos from St. Lawrence Island required deep knowledge of animal biology and behavior. With elaborate stories and vigorous pantomime, Steven Aningaiyou, the Gambell whaling captain, described how in order to successfully strike a whale the steersman had to guide the whaling boat as close to a surfacing whale as possible so the harpooner could plunge his weapon directly into its cervical vertebrae. He also demonstrated how hunters fooled animals by imitating their behavior or appearance. When approaching a seal basking on the ice, for example, the hunter scratched the ice with a seal-claw scratcher. When he was close enough, he stood and threw his harpoon, only then revealing his true identity to the animal. 174/A.-M. VICTOR-HOWE</page><page sequence="3">Yet the Siberian Yupik Eskimos' identity with animals was much more than just skillful imitation. They did not see animals as different from humans: animals could transform themselves into people and people could become animals. According to Serov (1988:244), Northeast Asians viewed most phenomena of the natural world in anthropomorphic terms, and some species were thought to live in communities similar to men's. For example, there were polar bear people, mouse people, wolf people, and spider people. In myths and tales, it was obvious that when a human and an animal met, the animal, although retaining his name, had a human shape. Such anthropomorphism is frequently found in Siberian Yupik Eskimo tales. One such story describes a whale who, in order to visit his lover, a married woman, disguises his soul as a man who emerges from the whale's blowhole. When the woman's husband discovers the two lovers, he goes to the beach where the whale is lying and strikes it with his harpoon. The whale does not die until later, when its soul has returned to its body, again through its blowhole (ibidem). For the people of St. Lawrence Island, hunting was risky and dangerous, not only because it demanded much skill and experience, but because animals had souls and could think. They would only give themselves to humans who treated them with enough respect. Steven Aningaiyou emphasized that if a whale hunter pointed at his quarry, or spoke its name out loud, the whale would become insulted and leave. The whale, in turn, sought out the most worthy hunter to give itself to by looking for the skin boat with the most skillfully-wrought, transparent skin. Likewise, if an animal did not receive proper treatment after it was killed, its spirit would encourage others of its kind to move far away. A successful whaling captain and his crew thus always respectfully welcomed the soul of the dead whale into the village and captain's house, and performed appropriate rituals to ensure the whale's reincarnation and future availability to the village. Rituals, including songs, incantations, food offerings and dances, besides being performed to guarantee the whale's reincarnation, were also propitiatory; they opened the whale's path from the sea to land and back to sea again, and thus were performed before the hunt by hunters and their wives to ensure success. Songs Songs were learnt during ceremonies and small gatherings of clan members inside their dwellings in the winter, the ideal time for older Siberian Yupik Eskimos to transmit their repertories to the younger generation. In winter, several clans gathered in a permanent settlement, whereas during the summer, each clan was in its own separate fishing camp. The mode of transmission of a song depended on its substance and purpose. A hunting song transmitted to a young man by an elder, for example, required a special SONGS AND DANCES/175</page><page sequence="4">time-frame and space. Generally, such apprenticeship was done inside, in the aagra (the living quarters of the Siberian dwelling) or in the nateq (the largest room in a Siberian dwelling) by the central pole. Some whaling songs also had to be transmitted by the central pole. Comic songs, on the other hand, did not require a special time and space: transmission occurred in a relaxed atmosphere and could be witnessed by the whole group as well as by outsiders such as guests from other villages. Such songs enabled people to express their feelings: an individual might tease a relative about a mistake he made with an in-law, for example. According to Estel Oosevaseuk and Linda Womkon Badten, cousins on the father's side could use songs to tease each other. One cousin might sing: "When are you going to make a better song. The one you just performed was not good. Please make a good song for a change and everybody can enjoy it". The other might sing back: "I am going to make any kind of song I like, in my own way, even if it is bad in your ears, I will do it my way". A singer might also ask for something he wished to own, like his cousin's boat. The cousin then had to choose between giving up his boat or responding with a song of his own. Songs that accompanied games were called qalghiitet' those sung for dances were called aghula. Some songs simply told a story, while others, called atuunq , were sung just for entertainment. Still other songs described the essential, everyday activities of the islanders such as fishing, hunting and gathering. Ritual songs honored animal souls killed during the previous season, conjured up animals so they could be captured, welcomed the souls of dead whales to the village, and sent them back to the ocean to be reincarnated. Songs also described heroic feats, legendary characters, or mythical animals which could change into humans. The words to a given song were not always understandable to the audience; often only a few people, such as the song's owner and clan members, could comprehend it. Songs accompanying dances were divided into two parts. The first part, called qemiq, had no words, and the theme was sung twice - once softly and slowly and once more loudly. The second part, called apalluq, had words and was also sung twice with the refrain faster and louder. Fast singing was called kallagun (meaning "to sing or play a song with fast pace"). Dances Dances were a vehicle for spiritual activities and were also held for recreation or social entertainment. They were a major component of Siberian Yupik Eskimo culture. Thus, for example, through dance the Eskimos reaffirmed sexual divisions in their society. In Eskimo culture men were providers of raw materials like meat, grease, and skins, while women processed and transformed the catch of the hunter and produced food and clothing; they also kept the fire burning in the seal oil lamps, and gathered plants and berries. Distinct dances expressed and differentiated each of these men's and women's activities. 176/A.-M. VICTOR-HOWE</page><page sequence="5">Through dance, the islanders also positioned themselves in the group. A whaling captain, for example, danced to reaffirm his position as leader. Everybody in the community knew that the success of the hunt depended on the size and quality of the captain's and his wife's dance and song repertory. Likewise, by performing in front of the whole village, a dancer reaffirmed his adherence to a particular clan. Each patrilineal clan had its own dance repertory, as well as a distinctive territory, dialect, clothing style, subsistence cycle, clan name, and set of religious beliefs, rituals, and songs. Dance repertories were transmitted through clan members. One's father, father's brother, and father's sister played an essential role in transmitting that knowledge, as well as knowledge of ceremonial practices and ritual songs. In addition, dances were a vehicle for spiritual activities. In order to reach the animal world, the dancer began a non-verbal dialogue with the different elements of the cosmos, particularly animals. This non-verbal language was adapted both in form and function to the dancer's perception and understanding of the natural world. For example, the dancer used body movements imitating animals in order to identify with them. Also, through this transformation into an animal, the performer anthropomorphized the animal, and thus was able to manipulate and capture it. By using pantomime - reproducing animal behavior or a successful hunt - the dancer anticipated future events and materialized his expectations. In the ceremonies preceding a hunt, for example, Siberian Yupik Eskimos rehearsed it, miming events they hoped would take place and lead to a happy ending. Dances were divided into three categories: sayuq, atuutipik and ilagaatet, Sayuq dances had required movements and were performed by the whole group. Atuutipik dances, also performed by the whole group, had improvised movements. Ilagaatet dances used improvised movements, but were only performed by shamans ( ilagagh means "to sing in this fashion"; ilagaguyuk means "one who sings ritual and shamanistíc songs"). Sayuq : The fixed motions of sayuq dances were created by the song's owner, a clan member, or a dance partner, and were closely timed to specific drum rhythms. The movements were learned in rehearsals and described particular phases of men's or women's activities like harpooning a whale, hauling a skin boat, processing fish, or picking berries. They also described the interaction between people and animals. A woman, for example, might perform certain movements to welcome the spirit of a whale into the village. One kind of sayuq dances, called talliq, consisted solely of arm movements performed by seated men. Another sayuq sub-category, called putuuq , were danced only by women. They were performed in a circle, during the whale hunting festival and consisted of jumping movements. According to Linda Womkon Badten and Lucille Wongittilin, such circle dances, as well as seated dances, were part of the whaling rituals. Similar dances were observed on mainland Siberia by Voblov (1952) and Zornitskaja (1983). SONGS AND DANCES/177</page><page sequence="6">S ayuq dances could be performed by an individual, a couple, or a group. The dancers always faced the drummers, and when performing in a group, positioned themselves either side by side, in a line, in an open circle, in a closed circle, or randomly. In the first part of a dance, called the qemiq , the performers' movements were roughly executed. Men vigorously stamped the ground in front of them and made jerky, tense movements. Women, by contrast, danced with graceful, sinuous movements of the head, neck, shoulders, chest, arms, and hands, always with their eyes averted, as it was considered improper for a woman to look at anyone while performing. Occasionally they made bouncing motions called peghleqaghtaq . Atuutipik : The atuutipik dances were not strictly choreographed. Often they depicted the behavior of certain animals. Movements were free and spontaneous, though timed to the rhythm of the drum. As in sayuq dances, women planted their feet firmly on the ground while men stamped the ground (tukaq) from time to time. While performing, men also shouted to entertain their audience. Often their shouts, called qalghiq , resembled animal cries. Sayuq (figurative dances) and atuutipik (abstract dances) were both secular and religious in function. During secular performances, the dancer never portrayed or imitated the characteristic motions of spirits, and his soul never left his body to travel and talk to spirits. When performing in rituals, dancers had to observe many rules and taboos. The timing of the performance was precisely determined, for example, and dancers had to prepare themselves physically and psychologically. According to Sachs (1938), there were also "open" Sayuq and atuutipik dances during which the dancers did not touch each other. In both dance forms, dancers tended to plant their feet on the ground, and their leg motions consisted mainly of a series of accentuated flexions and extensions perfectly synchronized with the rhythm of the drum. Ilagaatet: Shamanic dance performances generally took place in the center of the aagra . A special seal oil lamp, called kenghaq (meaning "a little light" or "a special light"), burned slowly on the floor, in front of the performer. Although no one was supposed to move or make any noise while the shaman danced and sang, often people in the audience became frightened and created a disturbance. That in turn was believed to disturb the spirits, who were afraid of scared people. A shaman's dance started with a few non-shamanic songs called ighlutku , during which the shaman left behind all human weaknesses. He then started to sing shamanic songs, frequently changing from one language to another, and altering his dancing rhythm, personality and physique in order to cross over to the animal world. While he sang, he sometimes made noises like "ha, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta", called ghhaalgha , as his soul left on its journey to talk to the sprits. At that point his portrayal of the characteristic motions of spirits fused into a visionary, ecstatic state. Visions could be revealed to him when he was in either a cataleptic or a dramatic trance. In a cataleptic trance, the shaman's body was an empty 178/A.-M. VICTOR-HOWE</page><page sequence="7">envelope deserted by his soul, which had left on a journey to converse with the spirits. When his soul reentered his body, the shaman was ready to tell his story to the audience with songs, gestures and dances. In a dramatic trance, the shaman, while on his journey, communicated his experience to the audience with words, songs, gestures, and dances, describing what he was seeing and what the spirits were telling him. In both cases, however, throughout his trance, the shaman actively provided creative imagery to his audience by playing a drum, speaking, singing, gesturing or dancing, thus demonstrating that he was in complete control, not possessed by spirits, and actively engaged in altering the course of natural events. Thus through dance the Siberian Yupik Eskimo 1) "expressed" his, and the group's, cultural values; 2) "merged" with the cosmos; 3) "communicated" with the animal world, deities, spirits and other humans; and 4) "exerted a physical influence" over the cosmos. Material used for dances St. Lawrence islanders performed dances during the winter, inside the aagra . With the heat from seal oil lamps and many people gathered in a small place, little clothing was necessary. According to Estel Oosevaseuk and Linda Womkon Badten, dancers wore only breeches of very fine caribou skin sewn or tied on their hips. Men's breeches were called safkiitaq and women's breeches raarwik. An absence of clothing did not mean an absence of personal adornment, however. Women's skin was well-decorated with tattoos on the face, arms, hands, breasts, and stomach. The thighs of young girls were tattooed when they reached puberty. Tattooing was generally performed by an older woman who began by marking small dots on the skin surface to trace the design she wanted. She then lifted the skin, usually with her left hand, and with her right hand passed a small needle and thread through it. The thread had been coated with a mixture of soot and urine and left a dark blue pigment under the skin. When she was done, the tattooer massaged the tattoo with more soot and urine. Two lines tattooed on a woman's nose were called atngaghun . Tattoos on her cheeks were called qilak ; a second tattoo on the lower part of the cheek was called tuutaq (tuuta meaning "base"). A single tattoo on the chin was called tamlughun, while multiple tattoos on the arms and hands were called iqalleq . Lilly Apangalook, Estel Oosevaseuk and Linda Womkon Badthen all remembered that most young girls did not mind the pain of being tattooed, as it was part of the excitement of growing up. Tattoos were desirable decorations, they said, and it was embarrassing for a woman not to wear them. Without tattoos, a woman looked like a man. Tattoos also protected women against evil spirits and diseases. Men were tattooed on their hands, wrists, elbows, waists, knees, and ankles, but seldom on their faces. Like women's tattoos, men's protected them against evils spirits and disease, though they mainly served to mark significant events in their lives, such as a SONGS AND DANCES/179</page><page sequence="8">successful whale hunt. Men also wore labrets made of stone, ivory, bone or glass at one or both corners of the lower lip. While dancing, women wore their hair in braids which hung down both sides of their faces. Colored strands of beads (called qupak) were attached to a round piece of ivory ( mellugtuqaq ) inserted at the top of the braids and woven down through them. The ivory was sometimes carved with radiating lines. Another hair ornament made of long reindeer hair and called qaghpa could be worn during ceremonies and special occasions by women whose husbands were successful whale hunters. According to the archeologist Otto Geist (1927-1929), who wintered on the island in the 1920s, white sealskin was occasionally inserted in the braids and used to keep the strands of beads from tangling. Braids could also be doubled up and tied with sinew. Geist wrote that bangs were worn by women who wanted to disguise themselves as boys to deceive evil spirits and ward off sickness. For the same reason, though less frequently, men adopted women's hair styles and wore bracelets. Men wore their hair shaved on top with fringe around the head. Like women, they had their waist, head, upper arm, wrist and neck girdled by a strip of leather with small little beads attached. Both men and women wore earrings, called quaghaltutaq, made of ivory, bone, or glass beads. A woman might also wear long strings of colored beads around her neck or crossed on her chest and back. Sometimes, women wore body harnesses of sealskin decorated with colored beads. This costume was completed with leather bands made of sealskin encircling the head (nasqughun), upper arm ( qepun )&gt; wrist ( tanqyeghun ), waist ( qukaghun ), lower knee and ankles ( tukughun ). By wearing many strings of beads, a woman showed that she belonged to a wealthy clan. When performing outside, women wore walrus intestine parkas decorated with red- dyed strips of unborn seal fur. Another type of parka worn by both men and women was made from walrus or bearded seal gut and decorated with the crests of Crested Auklets ( Aethia cristatella) sewn on the horizontal seams. Men also wore headdresses called tengayutet which were made of reindeer skin. Long hair gathered from the throat of a reindeer during the winter, when it was thick, was used to make special costumes. When dancing, both men and women wore gloves or mittens. Masks were also worn during special ceremonies and shaman rituals. They were usually fashioned, if not by the shaman himself, at least under his supervision. Drums Both songs and dances were accompanied by men playing drums, although women occasionally joined them. The number of drummers depended on the type of gathering. During small gatherings, like those limited to the members of a single clan, two to six drummers (depending on the clan's size) could perform. During large festivals attended by the clans of several different villages, drummers were more numerous. In both contexts, shamanic and ritual songs were usually accompanied by only one drummer. When there 180/A.-M. VICTOR-HOWE</page><page sequence="9">was more than one drummer, the leader selected the song and gave the signal to start, first playing his drum very softly and slowly. Those rules were most strictly adhered to during the performance of rituals. The drum ( saguyaq ), the basic musical instrument of the St. Lawrence Island Eskimos, was made from the inner lining of a walrus stomach stretched over a wooden frame. First, the frame, called iqeghtaq (meaning "texture"), was bent by pouring boiling water repeatedly over a strip of wood. When bent just right, it was placed on a circular mold to cool and set. A handle made of wood or ivory was lashed to the frame with strips of baleen, a strong material that lasted a long time. A walrus stomach membrane ( qaliq ) which had been scraped clean of all fat and blood with a tool called a ughviq and soaked in water, was then stretched over the frame and snugged into grooves carved on its outside surface. It usually took two to three hours to clean off one membrane and secure it to the frame. While completing the lashing, the drum maker might beat the drum several times to check its tone. Only when the sound seemed right did he finish lashing it. Drums were played with a wooden beater about eighteen inches long and curved at the beating end. The drummer struck the membrane from above, and never beat on the frame. Conclusion We have seen that St. Lawrence Eskimos songs and dances were the product of perceptions and of an intimate knowledge of the surrounding world, especially animal biology and behavior. The performer consciously metamorphosed his or her perceptions of the outside world and therefore established a physical bond with nature. By anthropomorphising animals, the dancer captured them. Songs and dances were thus a crucial prelude to the hunt and an integral part of the cosmic cycle.
