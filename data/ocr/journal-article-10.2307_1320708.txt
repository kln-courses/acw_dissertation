<plain_text><page sequence="1">STUDIES in Art Education Copyright by the A Journal of Issues and Research National Art Education Association 1996, 37(3), 145-159 The Construction of Learning and Teaching in a Sculpture Studio Class Patricia James University of Minnesota Teaching and learning to make art are complex cognitive, affective, and physical process- es that take place through individual and social exploration of material, form, and con- cepts. This qualitative study is a holistic investigation of a college-level introductory direct-metal sculpture studio class as a complex interactive sociocultural system in which elements such as the environment, personal characteristics, course structure, and social interactions provide constraints and opportunities for teaching and learning. Foundational, studio, and critical phases over an academic quarter are examined in relationship to how and what the professor communicated and to ways that students interacted with informa- tion, materials, and other people. To walk into the metal shop of the sculpture class where this qualitative study took place was to enter an environment of both tradition and innovation. The metal shop was a harshly physical world filled with raw and found materials, industrial- sized machines, and brazing equipment. Floors were gray concrete, walls were white cement blocks, and metal shelves on the side were stacked with a chaotic jum- ble of scrap metal and sculptures. Air ducts, hoses, and fluorescent lights created a complex maze across the corrugated metal ceiling. It was a potentially dangerous, visually dense, odor-filled, and noisy place where students cut, pounded, and brazed odd pieces of rusty junk or scrap metal into objects that were transformed into expressive and sometimes funky or surrealistic sculptures. Versions of this scene are commonplace sights in many studio departments where students are learning the basics of how to make sculpture. Despite the seem- ingly typical character of this class, close examination of such an environment informs us about how art is taught and learned in a situation that is unique in many ways, but which also reflects widespread patterns of studio education. A studio art class may be thought of as a complex sociocultural system in which multiple fac- tors such as personalities, values, the physical environment, instructional methods, and social interactions play a role in what is being communicated and how it is inter- preted. Adding to the complexity of the classroom are the technical and conceptual demands of the various art forms and media and the cognitive, affective, and social aspects of artistic processes. A number of qualitative studies have been undertaken which investigated some of the complexities of learning and teaching studio art in higher education, such as the influence of artworld beliefs on departmental, instructional, and student beliefs and behaviors (Adler, 1979; Madge and Weinberger, 1973); relationships among student personalities, beliefs, and goals (Strauss, 1970); and how students engage in creative processes (Cornock, 1984; Getzels &amp; Csikszentmahalyi, 1976). Other</page><page sequence="2">PATRICIA JAMES researchers have explored interpersonal interactions and the relationship of an instructor's philosophy to curriculum and instruction (Dinham, 1987; Janesick, 1982; Sevigny, 1977) and the social, philosophical, environmental, and pedagogical dimensions of a ceramics class (Stokrocki, 1981). With rapid changes taking place in student populations, art world practices, art technologies, and educational institutions, continued research about actual studio classrooms is necessary so that we may understand the nature of studio teaching and learning in various contexts. My purpose in this article is to present a holistic overview of interactions in one classroom over an academic quarter. A sample of classroom interactions is described, analyzed, and interpreted with a focus on ways that values, techniques, aesthetic concepts, and creative processes were taught and learned. Construction of the Study Theoretical Frameworks Collection and interpretation of data were shaped by systems theory, symbolic interactionism, and constructivism. Systems theory points to ways that individuals, social groups, cultural patterns, and the environment are mutually interactive (Dobbert, 1982). A studio class is comprised of individuals with their own cogni- tive, physiological, and affective subsystems, and it is also part of larger sociocul- tural systems, such as the art department, university, and artworld (James, 1994). In a systemic view, all elements in the context contribute to learning. Besides providing ways to think about sociocultural interactions, systems theory offers a way to understand the creative processes that are practiced in a studio class. As students learn to make art, they cognitively, affectively, and physically interact with materials, tools, aesthetic concepts, and other people. An "evolving systems approach" to creativity (Gruber, 1989) envisions a purposive, developmental process that occurs over time and in which multiple insights and heuristics are uti- lized in "a constant interplay among purpose, play, and chance" (p. 4). Social and environmental influences, task motivation, creativity-relevant skills, and domain- relevant skills (Amabile, 1983) also are considered to be vital components of cre- ative processes. The second framework of this study is symbolic interactionism (Blumer, 1969), which provides theory for observing and interpreting ways that individuals and groups construct cultural knowledge. Individuals interpret situations and act in ways that are contingent on their interpretations of their own and other individuals' actions and social negotiations. The construction of culture is an open-ended process in which shared and negotiated systems of meaning are communicated through socially constructed symbol systems that involve the total human psyche (Shore, 1991). Cultural meaning systems provide a range of constraints and possi- bilities for learning: they direct actions and social norms, evoke feelings, represent knowledge, and enable learners to construct new understandings of the world (D'Andrade, 1984). The third theoretical framework of this study is a constructivist perspective that considers learning to be an individual construction of knowledge within a context of shared meaning and social interaction (Bruner, 1990; Candy, 1991). Self-con- structing individuals have the capacity and disposition for awareness, introspection, autonomy, and complexity. Instead of a fixed progression of learning and similar 146</page><page sequence="3">LEARNING AND TEACHING IN A SCULPTURE CLASS outcomes, students learn in different ways and produce variable outcomes by con- structing models of reality that serve as guides for their actions and help them make sense of their experiences. Methods I chose this particular studio class in an art department in a Midwestern univer- sity because I was interested in ways that sculpture foundations are taught to art and non-art majors by a professor who had a fairly traditional modernist orientation to sculpture-making and teaching. Besides preparing art majors for further study, this introductory course fulfilled liberal arts requirements for other departments in the university, so instruction had to be relevant for students who intended to make a liv- ing in the artworld as well as for students who would take only one or two art cours- es and continue to major in such disciplines as science or engineering. There were 16 students in the class, five of whom were women; there was also a graduate and an undergraduate teaching assistant (TA). Except for three students in their late twenties, students were 18 to 22 years old. Although most students were European American, there was a West African, a Southern European, an African American, and an Asian American student. The professor, a well-estab- lished exhibiting sculptor, was a tenured member of the art department who had taught there for over 20 years. Although his teaching had been shaped largely by his own art schooling in the 1960s, he told me that he had also been influenced over the years by student feedback, feminism, and other socio-cultural changes. To gain an understanding of interactions in a sculpture class functioning within the institutionally defined boundaries of an academic quarter, I attended every two- hour class session twice a week over an eleven-week period. The sculpture class was investigated as a small culture with a social structure, communication patterns, and meanings. Ethnographic methods were used as a way to examine particular nuances of a classroom context because they allow the researcher the "holism of being there" (Peshkin, 1988, p. 418). Observations allowed me to obtain an overview of larger patterns, but I was also able to track individual students and take note of unpredictable occurrences, such as the idiosyncratic development of stu- dents' sculpture. Although I spoke to students during studio time, I did not make sculpture or contribute to class critiques. Through interviews, I gained a better understanding of participants' perspectives. Instructional Phases Course Structure The sculpture course was structured around three assignment cycles, each of which focused on different skills and concepts involved in direct-metal construc- tion. Assignment #1 was found object sculpture which introduced students to aes- thetic concepts, metalworking techniques, and creative and critical thinking processes; assignment #2 was a head/hat/helmet/mask sculpture which emphasized the transformation of sheet metal into three-dimensional volume; and assignment #3 was figurative sculpture which focused on the form and meanings of the human body. Each assignment went through three instructional phases: (1) foundational information; (2) studio; and (3) critique. Each phase introduced new concepts and techniques and reinforced those taught earlier. 147</page><page sequence="4">PATRICIA JAMES Foundational Phase Information presented at the beginning of each assignment taught the technical and conceptual foundations that informed studio work, critiques, and the next foun- dational cycle. Although students were asked to read a sculpture textbook and write questions (Kelly, 1983), foundational information was communicated primarily through speech, physical actions, sculptural materials and tools, and art works. On the first day, students received a syllabus from which the professor, Tim, read aloud to clarify course and departmental policies and to introduce course objectives: This is a basic course in which sculptural spatial concepts will be explored through direct metal construction. You will be asked to think creatively, imag- inatively, and experimentally with sculptural concepts, visual elements, and various materials. Tim departed from the written page to describe his philosophy about learning to make art, which reflected a curricular decision by the art department to teach "real sculpture" at the beginning of a student's career rather than starting with courses in formal design principles: 'This is a basic course'-that means that nobody needs to know nothin'about sculpture. You maybe never made a sculpture before in your life. That's OK. You're welcome. We have an interesting way that we approach our classes in the art department here...Most schools that I attended or know about...if you're a student interested in art or want to learn about sculpture, you get stuck in a fundamentals class first. You go into a 2-D design or 3-D design, cut out paper and paste it on things, and maybe braze or solder tin cans togeth- er and make kind of pretend sculptures for a semester or two, and then final- ly you're allowed into a class that makes real stuff. That's unfortunate that that does happen in these institutions. While a fundamentals course does cover lots of good ground, I know that when I was a student, I was always frustrated by that. I was waiting until I could really sculpt. Well, this class you can start right out and be a sculptor. We're not going to do exercises-we're going to make sculpture right off the bat. And so we may be a little bit lost at the begin- ning, but we'll find our way. And we won't be slowed down and carried through a lot of silly preliminary steps. Demonstrating techniques. Tim conducted four demonstrations in the metal shop to introduce students to metalworking tools and techniques. To demon- strate basic brazing techniques, he donned goggles to physically and verbally show how to turn on the gas, light the torch, and fuse pieces of metal. He used real metal to show brazing techniques so that students would be "serious braziers" when they worked on their own. Colorfully dramatic demonstrations directly engaged students and addressed their fears about working with fire. During technical demonstrations, Tim modeled values found within craft tradi- tions. In an apprenticeship situation, which is a common way for craft knowledge to be taught to a novice worker, a person learning techniques such as brazing absorbs an understanding of procedures by watching an expert work so that the knowledge of the master craftsperson becomes something that is holistically under- stood by the learner. When the apprentice attempts to do the work, he or she still needs to master the actual actions, but many of the procedures, values, and thinking processes will have already been learned from the expert's modeling (Coy, 1989). In this sculpture class, however, rapid learning was necessary to conform to institu- tional realities, so instruction had to quickly convey procedures and values about 148</page><page sequence="5">LEARNING AND TEACHING IN A SCULPTURE CLASS craft and safety. Since a confident attitude is safer than a fearful one, it was impor- tant that the professor dispel fears about working with dangerous techniques and caution students to be aware of the consequences of their actions. Besides teaching procedures, technical demonstrations also taught students about the nature of creative processes, which may be thought of as a dialectic relationship between an artist and his or her artistic materials in a kind of "conversation" (Bamberger, 1983). The professor's delight in making sculpture communicated to students important values about flexibility, risk taking, innovation, play, and spon- taneity-processes which are considered to be characteristics of creativity (Nachmanovitch, 1990; Perkins, 1981). Perkins suggests that "people who want to be creative, who deeply value such characteristics in themselves, are more likely to make themselves creative and keep themselves that way" (p. 272). By showing how a creative person acts and thinks, Tim gave students permission to act similarly. One example of Tim's modeling of creative processes was his demonstration of methods for finishing surfaces of sculptures. Students stood in a loose circle as he danced around a crude metal sculpture he had made to show finishing techniques such as using a power grinder. Besides providing technical information, the demon- stration encouraged students to go beyond predictable solutions. He seemed to thor- oughly enjoy playing with materials and tools. When Tim randomly sprayed green paint on the sculpture, he exclaimed: "That's exciting to me! This is a wonderfully elusive ghostlike green circle...Ah! Turns me on! I like it!" When Tim demonstrated, he integrated reflection-in-action (Schon, 1987) by translating his working process into verbal language. Like a jazz musician, he iden- tified the underlying structure of the sculpture, found variations, invented new visu- al relationships, and improvised actions and words as he gave a verbal "tour" of his thoughts to the class. Tim also emphasized the value of creative play. After sug- gesting that exotic materials such as fake fur might be interesting to apply to their sculpture, Tim advised students that taking risks is important: "You cannot not try something because you're afraid you'll wreck it. If you wreck it, you can fix it." Showing examples of art. By seeing slides and actual art at the beginning of each assignment, students learned about concepts and values involved in making and thinking about art. When students brought in a variety of found objects for the first assignment, Tim talked about each student's favorite object, thus promoting a sense of ownership for their personal choices, increasing students' motivation, and enhancing a sense of community. He also brought in one of his own found object sculptures. For the second assignment, which focused on the human head, Tim play- fully modeled several past students' masks and hats and two whimsical masks he had made himself. To prepare for the figurative assignment, students drew from a live nude model to gain an understanding of the gesture, balance, and proportion of the human body. Typical of many studio classes, the slides of art that Tim showed at the beginning of each assignment were used to help students solve artistic problems more than they were used to present art history (Collins, 1987). Work by artists such as Yves Tinguely, Mark DiSuvero, Nikki St. Phalle, Lucas Samaras, and Archimboldo offered a visual vocabulary of form, techniques, and aesthetic concepts with which students could set their goals, develop their sculptures, and evaluate their own work. Students saw art made in other times and by other cultures, but the majority of the slides represented twentieth century Western aesthetic concepts, traditions, and val- ues. They also saw slides of Tim's and the TA's art work. During slide presentations, 149</page><page sequence="6">PATRICIA JAMES which were shown in a classroom next to the metal shop, students sat quietly lis- tening while the professor energetically moved around the room and presented his views about the art work. Transformation of materials and ideas was an important theme throughout the quarter. As Tim prepared students for the first assignment, he showed slides of found object sculptures, including Picasso's cast bronze sculpture Baboon and Young, which has a head made of a toy car. Tim energetically became part of the image and seemed to transform himself into a sculpture as he moved in front of the screen to point out sculptural qualities and describe how Picasso made the work. To explain how the toy car takes on new meanings within the context of the sculpture, Tim said: "We get tickled by that-we get delighted. We know where it comes from, and we see how the artist transformed it into something that speaks in a new way." Tim suggested that a sensible approach to making sculpture is not desirable, but lightness and a sense of energy are valued. When talking about how sculptures relate to their supporting surfaces, he described the way students tend to build sculp- tures that are visually heavy at the base: Sometimes the whole bottom part of the sculpture is kind of hugging the ground...There might be some magic going on up in here in the rest of the sculpture-and it's all kind of heavy down there on the bottom. We want to watch for that. To illustrate preferred sculptural qualities, Tim showed work by sculptor Nancy Graves: I love to look at the way sculptures touch the ground. This piece is on three little points-she looks like she's teasing the ground-she's flirting with the ground-she dodges the ground-and teases it in a nice way. I can see space up there-if I were a little tiny man I could walk right through that...I love the feel of the piece being a kind of dancing piece. Tim's dramatic words and actions made sculptures seem to be living beings that breathe, dance, and communicate with us, often in magical ways. When Tim expressed appreciation for the seemingly alchemical transformation of materials, he communicated a vitalistic tradition in which sculptural form represents the life forces found in living beings; such form seems to possess what Henry Moore described as "pent-up energy, an intense life of its own, independent of the object it may represent" (in Read, 1964, p. 163). As a child believes in the reality of sand cas- tles, the professor invested belief in art and artistic processes. When he encountered something like a gestural line in a sculpture, he verbally described the gesture and used his body to show what such a gesturefeels like. In doing so, Tim conveyed the way gestures give vitality to sculpture, and he established expressiveness as a val- ued quality. The professor embodied the quintessential twentieth century artist who values experimentation, play, originality, and rule-breaking (Poggioli, 1968). He celebrat- ed the transformation of materials into new forms, and he pointed out nuances in sculptural forms and meanings by showing students subtle qualities that are not eas- ily verbalized, but which must be understood in context. Students learned to see the "whole complex of feelings" (Briggs, 1988, p. 39) that may be perceived in artistic materials and form, and they learned the difference between the "factual approach" of practical utility and the "creative approach" of "purpose, sensitivity, and the abil- ity to visualize an emotionally and aesthetically exciting image" (Briggs, 1988). 150</page><page sequence="7">LEARNING AND TEACHING IN A SCULPTURE CLASS A female student explained the impact of the slides on her ability to think cre- atively: I didn't find a lot of that stuff appealing, but seeing all those slides with all of those ridiculous things clumped together made me feel like I had a lot of lat- itude-I could go quite a ways before it would seem ridiculous. Other students admitted to being influenced by the slides, but a few were con- cerned about what they thought might be copying. The classically trained woman from Southern Europe was the only student who sketched while she watched the slides. Studio Phase An important arena for learning creative processes and aesthetic concepts was the metal shop, where students grappled with materials to construct their own sculp- tures. Students worked on long metal tables separated by partitions into individual brazing stations outfitted with torches. Some materials were supplied in the shop for a student fee; others were brought in by students. Although assignment deadlines served as a structure, students set their own work pace and chose when to be social- ly interactive and when to work in relative isolation. Students also spent varying amounts of time working in the shop outside class. Interacting with materials. As students developed their sculptures, they were often engaged in intense isolation. With faces masked by goggles, students bent over flaming torches to fuse, cut, or bend their metal. The professor told me what this solitary experience feels like: "You get into this small world with its light and its fire and all the darkness around it and it gets so concentrated that you're star- tled by anyone who interrupts that." As they worked, students engaged in cognitive, physical, and affective interac- tions involving aesthetic concepts, self-knowledge, memory, imagination, and feed- back from tools and materials. Students interacted with materials by playing with them, "talking" with them, emotionally responding to them, exploring their innate physical and formal characteristics, matching them to mental models, and endow- ing them with meaning. Making art may be thought of as a kind of "conversational learning" (Bamberger &amp; Sch6n, 1983) in which students match what they see evolv- ing in their materials against mental images shaped by such factors as personal experience or slides shown during foundational stages. These personally and cul- turally constructed images allow students to recognize, act on, make sense, and find meaning in their materials and sculptural forms. By focusing purposively on the intrinsic qualities of the materials and the emergent sculptural forms, students prac- tice perceiving, analyzing, interpreting, and evaluating sculpture. Some students were able to be self-directed in their choices, to evaluate their work, change directions when necessary, and understand what their work meant. By pushing themselves to reach satisfactory closure, these students extended them- selves physically and intellectually so that there was a sense of real work being done, a willingness to work hard despite the potential for failure, and a feeling that their sculpture was meaningful. For other students, however, the whole quarter may have been a training in how to be self-directed in art; these students did not reach closure with their sculpture because they did not know how to set artistic goals, per- ceive formal structure within their materials, manage time, or interpret meanings. Interacting with instructors. The professor and two teaching assistants circulated around the room to monitor students' work and physically assist or talk with students. At the beginning of the quarter, the professor and teaching assistants 151</page><page sequence="8">PATRICIA JAMES worked closely with students; toward the end of the quarter, however, the instruc- tors played a less intrusive role. The instructors assisted students by offering phys- ical help, modeling techniques, and helping students perceive their work in new ways. Conversations were sometimes lengthy as the student and instructor stared at the student's sculpture, picked it up, held new pieces of metal up to it, or turned it in different directions to evaluate progress and discuss alternatives. The instructors translated their thoughts into words and actions so that students could hear and see how artists generate and solve artistic problems. By using their own experiences to inform their comments, the instructors spoke as if making sculp- ture was a collaborative effort between them and the students. They used a "joint experimentation" approach (Sch6n, 1987) in which they responded to the goals established by each student. Much of the instructors' assistance consisted of model- ing a creative attitude: they verbally and physically asked "what if' so students could perceive alternative solutions. The professor explained his instructional role: I don't want to shoot down somebody's idea...but rather-if necessary-to help guide it somewhere that maybe they didn't originally plan for it to go. I think part of my job is not to get everybody to make it my way. I want them to make them their way and I want them to understand where they're going on it-and maybe ask the right questions to get it to be more complex or to develop some levels to it. Interacting with peers. When students left their work areas to wander around the shop to look at other students' work, chat, and help each other, they learned a variety of creative strategies and sculptural techniques. Rosenthal and Zimmerman (1978) describe ways that students learn from observing other students: inhibition, avoiding an action because it may be inappropriate; disinhibition, find- ing that a previously prohibited behavior is safe; and novel behavior, learning a new action by watching a peer and duplicating his or her behavior. Some students mon- itored their own work in relationship to what they thought other students were doing by mentally competing with other students, working secretively because they were afraid others would steal their ideas, or using peers' work as a measure for the kind of effort required by the professor. Students taught each other in a number of ways: they modeled kinesthetically through tool use, facial expressions, and energy levels; verbally through their responses, questions, suggestions, and opinions; and visually through their sculp- tures. Students' assumption of instructional roles was sometimes a conscious deci- sion to teach, as when a student tried to help a peer solve a technical problem, but usually the instructional role was unconscious, as when a student with excellent craft skills modeled methods and standards. Even a student who had problems may have inadvertently taught a peer by showing what not to do. Most students approached their work with a sense of play, adventure, and spon- taneity, but others approached their work more cautiously as they struggled to learn new skills and concepts. When they were confronting their fear of public failure, anxiety about a poor grade, and other factors that are considered to be culturally and personally-developed blocks to creative thinking (Amabile, 1983), students were sometimes rigid and mechanical. Students who had taken few art classes were not used to the responsibility of developing their own ideas. The actions of a student who was more comfortable with metalworking techniques, risk-taking, or develop- ing visual ideas served as a model for inexperienced or blocked students. By watch- ing their peers do unexpected things with materials and make mistakes, other stu- 152</page><page sequence="9">LEARNING AND TEACHING IN A SCULPTURE CLASS dents gained a sense of permission to play with materials, to do something beyond their own thresholds of expectation and to make mistakes. A non-art major was an example of a student who became relatively disinhibit- ed over the quarter. A former technician of digital equipment, she had previously thought of herself as a linear thinker who was only comfortable when the outcomes of a problem were predictable and easily controlled. After watching other students play with materials, however, she allowed herself to become more spontaneous and to see the form of materials rather than just the function. Critique Phase At the end of each of the three assignment cycles, a class session was devoted to critiquing students' sculptures. A side room was arranged for a gallery-like presen- tation with special lighting and pedestals, and the class stood in a group around each sculpture as it was discussed. Although the professor provided much of the pacing, the content of each critique depended to a large extent on the nature of each sculp- ture and on students' contributions to the discussion. Each critique involved students in slightly different ways. In the first critique, the professor asked students to "vote" for their favorite sculptures by placing paper slips near them. Students had to explain their choices, and there was a high degree of participation. In the second cri- tique, the two TAs were asked to initiate the discussions. A celebratory feeling was created when a few students spontaneously put on their masks and the professor whimsically donned a student's flower hat sculpture. In all three critiques, there were seldom moments of heavy silence waiting for someone to speak; instead, there was usually a lively chorus of voices. A studio critique may be potentially damaging to students' self-esteem because their competencies and personal experiences may be publicly revealed (Werik, 1985). In this class, however, the students and the professor's words and actions contributed to making critiques fairly safe and nurturing experiences. During the first critique, for example, a non-art major spontaneously started clapping for anoth- er student's work. After that time, clapping during critiques became a class tradition, although it is not generally a custom in studio art classes. Other supportive charac- teristics of the critiques included spontaneity, empathy, and equality-all qualities considered to be important for an effective studio critique (Werik, 1985). A few students spoke only when their own work was being discussed, but most students contributed frequently to discussions of their peers' sculptures by describ- ing their feelings and interpretations. Students were enthusiastic about sculptures in which they could interpret anthropomorphic subject matter or animals; they showed approval for what they perceived as expressive energy and disapproval of sculpture that seemed too controlled. Several students spoke about their own work; but per- sonal information about their sculptures was usually not offered or questioned, and there was little discourse about what making sculpture meant in the students' lives. Some students' comments were based on popular culture such as movies and television, but many of the students' judgments and interpretations reflected the avant-garde values promoted by the professor, such as a preference for emotional expression, energy, individuality, and crude form over highly polished work. Several students were highly critical of a student's sculpture that they considered to be too rigid and well-crafted; one student compared it to art produced in Nazi Germany. Some students, such as the West African, presented in their work and comments a glimpse of alternative aesthetic perspectives; but there was generally little explicit discussion about differences in aesthetic perspectives or cultural tradi- 153</page><page sequence="10">PATRICIA JAMES tions, even during the mask assignment, which can be associated with many non- Western traditions such as such as communal celebration. Although the professor's manner seemed non-directive, he carefully structured each student's critique to elicit student comments and then present an overview. As students talked, he supported their comments by smiling, laughing, asking ques- tions, and underlining their words with "aha" and "yes." After students had talked for a few minutes about a sculpture, Tim responded to comments and directed stu- dents' attention to formal and technical qualities by moving close to a sculpture to point out areas for students to notice. He ended most sessions with a monologue that discussed aesthetic concepts, pointed out strengths and problems, suggested changes, and concluded with praise for the sculpture and the working process. Tim used students' sculptures as opportunities for teaching concepts such as craftsmanship, distinctions between art and nature, and artistic standards. He allud- ed to the many dimensions and ironies of aesthetic issues and led students into the realms of paradox, mystery, and ambiguity that often shape artistic meanings (Briggs, 1988). Students were engaged in talking about aesthetic issues such as ways that something like a penny may be art, kitsch, or merely serve a monetary function; and they talked about paradoxical differences in the qualities of things, such as ugliness that is beautiful and beauty that is ugly. Tim's comments were often stated in an exploratory way, but he made his aes- thetic preferences clear. For example, when he critiqued a found object relief sculp- ture made out of a vegetable steamer that resembled a sun, he warned students to avoid such stereotypical imagery: The sun-that image of the sunburst circle-sun sculpture-every gift shop in this world's got something [like it] for sale. It's a dangerous image to work with because of all of that kind of bad stuff that uses the same image. I think [her work] is not to be categorized with the sort of formula sun sculptures in the gift store-but it is a dangerous image. The professor expressed approval for each student's sculpture, but he showed preference for those that seemed to have an expressive vitality; and he implied dis- approval for works he classified as "kitsch," "too cute," or that did not transform materials. When he acknowledged work that he liked, Tim smiled and enthusiasti- cally made comments like, "I love the way...," "it's delightful to me to see how it is transformed..., or "what a wonderful...," but he looked troubled when he hesitating- ly criticized a student's sculpture, as if criticizing was something he preferred not to do. There was an underlying assumption that students' objects counted as sculp- ture-perhaps at beginning levels of expertise-but sculpture nevertheless. Reflections about the Sculpture Class The Class as a Learning and Teaching System The sculpture class may be thought of as a complex, interactive system that was both structured and unstructured. Studio work and critiques were limited by con- straints such as time, the environment, the professor's aesthetic preferences, and the assignments; but in many ways, the students' sculptures and the critical discussions were unpredictable and provided opportunities for new directions. One way to envi- sion this learning and teaching system is shown in Figure 1. Student learning is placed at the top of the triangle; teaching processes of the professor and peers form the base. A student's sculpture is at the center of the system as a focus of practice 154</page><page sequence="11">LEARNING AND TEACHING IN A SCULPTURE CLASS Figure 1: Learning and Teaching Interactions in the Sculpture Class ONE STUDENT$S PROCSE LEARNING PROCESS l ear and practce * * read text aesfhe concepts, ? see artistic exemplars chniues, a t ite ng to h lar pniesses a .n t acain e * an omete to space, tOte y TEACHING e TEACHINiG a^ systems;thi complexity'.nouraged processesconsideredtobeimportant ing flei question d d (n Th prfes s sit i n t naur o t construct own sculpture evauate student work cha\ racteristics of.whathe cs* choose artto cexemplars ? interact wth peers tea c , ? ira w th prcfessor ceae pcesses \ ir,'ad vvih students Q0/ i.L f%1 learning and teaching interactions during studio phase and i0O learning and teaching interactions over the entire quarter and a physical manifestation of artistic concepts. The professor and other students were teachers; the professor had an important role in the student's working process through his instruction, modeling, and feedback; and students had a role in the stu- dent artist's work through their modeling and feedback. The student's work, in turn, instructed the professor and the student's peers. By integrating knowledge about aesthetics, creative processes, criticism, and art history, students gained a holistic understanding of sculpture. Knowledge was com- municated and learned through cognitive, affective, social, kinesthetic, and sensory systems; this complexity encouraged processes considered to be important for effec- tive systemic learning such as tolerance of ambiguity, recognition of complex rela- tionships, utilization of unpredictable occurrences, paradoxical thinking, risk-tak- ing, flexibility, and dialogue (Swenson, 1993). The Professor as a Model of Engagement The professor's personality and philosophy strongly influenced the nature of this sculpture class. He never offered a specific definition of art; instead, he showed characteristics of what he considered to be artistic by pointing to the domain of art and implying that art is both knowable and ineffable.

The professor gave students permission to take a feelingful and embodied approach to art. By expressing his loves, doubts, and other feelings, the professor made himself vulnerable, but he maintained his position of authority. When he gave voice to curiosity, wonder, and joy, and as he modeled sensuality and engagement, he taught the importance of feelings and openness to experience. Perkins (1981) describes the "passionate enterprise" of being creative and the importance of feel- ings as a way of understanding the art that one makes: "Emotions provide knowl- edge, point to knowledge, and constitute knowledge crucial to the maker. Emotions are a way of knowing" (p. 121). The professor also served as one of the "gatekeepers" of the art world (Ridgeway, 1989) who maintain professional standards, and who eventually decide which students are allowed to enter and graduate from graduate school. As gate- keeper in this beginning-level class, the professor seemed to have an open-door pol- icy. Student sculptures were judged not only in terms of art world standards, but also for ways that each sculpture set and solved its own sculptural problems. Students' individual growth and learning about art took precedence over the evaluation of stu- dents' sculptures as art. At the end of the quarter, the professor gave each student a grade that was a virtual stamp of approval and permission to continue to another level; except for one "B," all students received a final grade of "A." Student Sculpture as a Focus of Practice and Critique Students' sculptures taught creative process, aesthetics, and critical process. Although there was a similar funky, expressive quality in many of the sculptures that was a result of students' beginning expertise, materials, and foundational instruction, students' sculptures were relatively individualistic. Lack of planning, unforeseen technical problems, and the nature of creative thinking were likely to produce unexpected directions in students' work that resulted in sculptures that were different from what they had expected. This unpredictability forced novel kinds of problem solving and promoted the construction of new knowledge. The relatively varied subject matter and formal qualities in students' sculptures provided a range of aesthetic and critical issues. Sculptures made during the figura- tive assignment, for example, included a finely crafted warrior made of rods; an eight-foot-high wooden crucifix with a Christ-like metal figure made of a wig-stand head, a Christmas-light halo, pop can arms, and newspaper legs; a Picasso-like fig- ure with a bicycle seat pelvis and a light bulb head; three tiny figures on telephone- pole crucifixes signifying the relationship between ancient Rome and contemporary society; several small gestural nudes; a female breast-plate made and worn by a male student; a trombone player; and a poorly made, larger-than-life figure that had to be propped up in a corner of the room for the last critique. This diversity of stu- dent work expressed students' personalities, goals, values, and interests in such things as politics, music, African art, or pop culture; and it mirrored the pluralism of 20th century sculpture students had read about in their text. The Class as a Community of Learners The previous descriptions of classroom interactions show that many aspects of learning to make art are highly social. The class may be thought of as a small com- munity of people purposefully engaged in a common activity. Several activities, including a "name game" on the second day, helped build a supportive, light-heart- ed social climate that undergirded interactions over the quarter. The casualness of 156</page><page sequence="13">LEARNING AND TEACHING IN A SCULPTURE CLASS the studio and critiques strongly contributed to a sense of community and shared purpose. As one student stated, "It helps when people are supportive and when peo- ple are on your side." The professor often spoke to the students as collective learn- ers: "Now you guys are really becoming pros!" or, "It's wonderful to watch you all do well-it's a small miracle." By the enthusiasm in his voice, he sounded as if stu- dents were accomplishing something new and important, not just repeating some- thing he had seen hundreds of times. As a small community, the class celebrated individual human creativity and "per- sonal aesthetic gestures" (Dissanayake, 1988) as they explored, played, worked, and philosophized together. As they made and talked about art, the class engaged in acts of "making special" (Dissanayake, 1991) by shaping, transforming, embellishing, juxtaposing, and interpreting objects and ideas in ways that were outside the routine of their daily lives. They were engaged in varying degrees of effort to give meaning to their lives through art by envisioning themselves and the world aesthetically, metaphorically, physically, and imaginatively. There was a paradox in this community, however: although there was solidarity in the class's focus on sculpture, the bonding took place in the rather impersonal environment of the educational institution and seemed removed from the personal realities of individuals. Students were seldom referred to by their names, and there was little mention of students' cultural backgrounds or of the realities of their lives, such as jobs, course loads, romance, or illness-factors that may have affected var- ious students' working processes and the content and nature of their sculpture. There were varying responses to the open structure of the course. Many students thought that the class was "wonderful," because they were encouraged to play with materials with few limitations imposed on them and they felt free of academic expectations to perform in prescribed ways. For example, when the student from Southern Europe contrasted her more formal academic art training in her country with the approach in this class, she said that the American way is "great-it allows you to experiment. It also makes you pace yourself, while in the other [European] system you can go on and on and on without ever really having to confront your aspirations or if you are good at anything apart from copying." Other students had problems with this seeming freedom, however, and thought there were flaws in this approach to learning. A former architecture student was crit- ical of what he considered to be the equivocal quality of the critiques and said, "I don't think the class is geared toward serious understanding." A science major, who did not understand the rationale for artistic play and the lack of specific instruction- al guidelines, was unable to take the class seriously because "all we did was play," and he wished the class had more technical instruction. The West African student was disappointed that there was not more focus on traditional and contemporary African sculpture. Conclusion Through detailed description and analysis of classroom interactions, we may gain understanding of how a particular group of people in a specific context taught and learned to make art, and we may see the complexity of interactions that occurred in one quarter-long period. Many characteristics of this class were similar to what might be found in studio classes around the country, but many were unique to this situation and were defined by the particular characteristics of the students, 157</page><page sequence="14">PATRICIA JAMES the professor, and the environment. Classes with differing student populations that are led by professors with divergent aesthetic and instructional philosophies, would likely have different assignments, instructional methods, student products, and course content. This study is part of my ongoing investigation of studio learning and teaching. Continued qualitative research of other studio environments will illuminate the diverse realities of studio learning and teaching in various contexts, and further investigations of such factors as peer interactions, instructional delivery, creative processes, and instructional phases will enable further understanding of their con- nectedness and meanings within studio classroom systems.
