<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Waldgänger," Traitor, Partisan Figures of Political Irregularity in West German Postwar Thought Eva Horn Europa-Universität Viadrina, Frankfurt/Oder, Germany In 1962 Carl Schmitt had a dream. In a global political situa- tion characterized by a high-risk, though immobilizing, stalemate between the superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, Schmitt dreamt of a figure capable of reanimating the frozen Cold War world. In a world which had drawn an insurmountable frontier between East and West, thereby splitting Germany in half, Schmitt dreamt of a warrior without frontiers or front lines. At the very moment when - with more pragmatism than enthusiasm - West Germany rallied round the United States and Western Europe, Germany's wartime enemies (the GDR meanwhile accommodating itself as the other, Eastern enemy's satellite), Schmitt dreamt of a figure who knew unambiguously who his friend and enemy "really" were. The Theory of the Partisan , first given as two lectures in Franco's Spain in the spring of 1962, barely a year after the construction of the Berlin Wall, is a Cold War text. It is deeply embedded in a political debate among German intellectuals of the fifties and early sixties, a debate centered on the possibility of regaining a position of autonomy beyond the binarism of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. conflict. The Cold War structure of enmity is • 125</page><page sequence="2">126 # "Waldgänger Traitor, Partisan the unspoken question to which the Theory of the Partisan tries to find an answer, even if Schmitt doesn't seem to be sure whether the partisan is the symptom of or the solution to Cold War politics, and thus presents him in a highly ambivalent manner. His image vacillates between an object of nos- talgic yearning - the nineteenth century's heroic defender of his father- land - and a symptom of political disarray, if not of pure terror: the secret agent, traitor, saboteur, and globally operating terrorist. In this ambiva- lence, Schmitt 's Theory of the Partisan reflects and continues a broader dis- course in postwar Germany, one focusing on figures that transgress or blur the simplistic structure of Cold War enmity, such as the defector, the resist- ance fighter, the traitor, and the lone fighter [Einzelkämpfer]. The partisan radiates the glamour - and the danger - of total political autonomy, of resis- tance, or, as Carl Schmitt puts it, of political "irregularity." It is in this context, one especially indicated in and through the writings of Ernst Jünger, the conservative German American journalist Margret Boveri, and the liberal author and politician Rolf Schroers, all broadly cited in The Theory of the Partisan , that I would like to situate Schmitt 's specific modeling of his figure. What links Schmitt to these three authors beyond personal friendships (with Jünger and Boveri), or extensive quotations in the case of Schroers, whose book Der Partisan (1961) was published only one year before Schmitts talks on the partisan, is a common interest in figures of political irregularity. In their political diagnosis of Germany of the fifties and early sixties, all four share the impression of a deep political crisis that can only be grasped in the form of a symptomatic human figure, a Gestalt. Schroers's book on the partisan, which would profoundly inspire Schmitt 's theory, names this common approach in its subtitle: Ein Beitrag zur politi- schen Anthropologie (A Study in Political Anthropology ). As much as that of Schroers, Schmitt's partisan is a "study in political anthropology." Taking an "anthropological" approach to political diagnosis means to analyze polit- ical situations in terms of Gestalten , the figures that they give birth to, to ana- lyze conflicts in terms of human tactics and strategies. Schmitt's famous quotation of Theodor Däubler, " Der Feind ist unsere eigene Frage als Gestalť [The enemy is our own question as Gestalt] (Schmitt 1995, 87), 1 precisely marks the intrinsic structure of political thought in terms of Gestalt; it is an</page><page sequence="3">Eva Horn # 127 anthropomorphism of political analysis, the translation of an abstract "question" or situation into a human figure. This figure gives a "face" to a political situation; it embodies its crisis - or that crisis s resolution. While Schmitt and Schroers (the latter in a much broader sense than the former) give this diagnostic Gestalt the name "partisan," Ernst Jünger and Margret Boveri seem to deal with the same abstract question - that of political irreg- ularity - in different terms. Ernst Jünger (i960) designs a figure of radical dissent and autonomy whom he calls Waldgänger, the "one who goes to the woods." Margret Boveri (1956) investigates the political pathologies of the first half of the twentieth century and calls its emblematic tragic figure bluntly "the traitor." Inasmuch as the Waldgänger ; the traitor, and the parti- san are siblings, children of a common question, a brief glance at Jünger s, Boveris and Schroers s work cited in The Theory of the Partisan might help to elucidate not only Schmitťs background, but also some aspects of and bearings on the question for which the partisan is the answering Gestalt . We have, therefore, to define this question more closely. Schmitt him- self cunningly promoted The Theory of the Partisan as a Zwischenbemerkung , i.e., as a parenthetical remark or digression upon his Concept of the Political ( Begriff des Politischen), first published - 31 years earlier - in 1932. But what sort of belated "parenthesis" is meant here? One intended as a historico- political digression or appendix, a postscript motivated by "current cir- cumstances," or an erratic notice, "embedded" within a given theoretical context in which its status is not exactly (or not yet) defined? All that is clear about the status of the partisan in the context of Schmitťs political theory is that its partisan is inspired by the famous definition of the politi- cal as the "discrimination between friend and enemy." Schmitt calls him the "touchstone" [Prüfstein], a test criterion of the "friend-enemy group- ing" (Schmitt 1995, 36). But if he is a test, then he is one particularly suited to demonstrating the pertinence of the 1932 text in 1962s current circum- stances. In his foreword to the 1963 edition of his Concept of the Political, Schmitt makes this very clear: The Cold War subverts all the classical distinctions between war, peace, and neutrality; between politics and economy; military and civil; combatants</page><page sequence="4">128 # "Waldgänger Traitor, Partisan and non-combatants - but not the distinction between friend and foe, the consistency of which is its source and its essence. [Der kalte Krieg spottet aller klassischen Unterscheidungen von Krieg und Frieden und Neutralität, von Politik und Wirtschaft , Militär und Zivil , Kombattanten und Nicht-Kombattanten - nur nicht der Unterscheidung von Freund und Feind , deren Folgerichtigkeit seinen Ursprung und sein Wesen ausmacht.] (Schmitt 1996, 18). The partisan personifies a radicalized enmity. He is a political agent whose focus on a "real enemy" does not allow for any all- too -pragmatic alliances, arrangements, and neutralities [Neutralisierungen]. He is the embodiment of that which for Schmitt is political nature [das Politische], as opposed to mere "politics. " In his Concept of the Political, Schmitt had famously defined "the political" [das Politische] as the distinction between friend and enemy, leaving open the question whether this distinction would be an act of recog- nition or of willful decision. Is the enemy a hidden figure who has to be unmasked - or is he the object of a decisionistic act of inclusion/exclusion? Also left unaddressed was the question how this enmity would be enacted. How do we deal with our "real" or "absolute" enemies? What are the strate- gies and tactics of modern enmity? The Theory of the Partisan, in dealing with very specific forms of struggle, its techniques and tactics, gives these questions a concrete if not exemplary shape. It not only deals at length with an invisible, intangible enemy, the partisan, and thus implicitly raises the problem of how to know the enemy; it also dwells with great emphasis on the social, political, and juridical implications that a given form of battle, partisan warfare, will engender. In these details, an aspect or quality of the political emerges which no longer can be described in the juridical and governmental terms of The Concept of the Political. The Theory of the Partisan ( Theorie des Partisanen ) shifts the perspective on enmity towards its military and technological aspects. Warfare thereby invades and illuminates the political sphere, elu- cidating how specific forms of war transform and redefine the political domain. Schmitt thereby tries to recoup that which he calls "the political," the essence of political conflict and struggle, from the " politische</page><page sequence="5">Eva Horn # 129 Sachtechnik , " mere "political management" of contemporary politics.2 To intellectuals like Schmitt, Jünger, Boveri, and Schroers, current politics in the stabilization phase of post-World War II Germany is compromise, rational problem-solving, accommodation, and pragmatic arrangement within a system of preexisting affiliations, such as - on the level of interna- tional affairs - the Cold War blocs, or - on the national level - the given party system. Schmitt notes that "today" (i.e., in 1963), Germany politically is still a "spoils of war," a formal peace between Germany and the Allies never having been concluded. The war had, juridically speaking, never ended, but was just transformed into a new system of antagonisms (Schmitt 1995, 64). The four authors try to envisage - at all political levels - a "third option" [ein dritter Weg]. As this third option is not being offered by regular politics, the essence of "the political" must be found in nonregular, uncon- ventional forms of conflict. What is thus at stake in German political thought in the fifties is a theory of political irregularity, and Schmitt s Theory of the Partisan is one of its most powerful and consequential versions. "Irregular" is thus the first predicate attributed by Schmitt to the par- tisan. But apart from stating, somewhat vacuously, that "the distinction between regular and irregular battle depends on the degree of regularity" (Schmitt 1995, 11), Schmitt does not substantially define the regular or the irregular - he only gives historical examples of it. Irregularity distin- guishes the partisan from the soldier - and only by virtue of this distinc- tion does it become clear what irregularity means. Its main characteristics are (1) the invisibility of the partisan who does not wear a uniform and hides amongst civilians; (2) his avoidance of direct confrontation with the enemy, consequence of the dissolution of front lines; (3) his mobility as one operating alone or in small groups, armed with light weaponry; and (4) the intense political commitment that lets him fight beyond all chances of success and survival. Moving from the level of military tactics to the more general one of political operations, "irregularity" can be defined as (1) operating under the cover of invisibility; (2) the absence of direct, straightforward confrontations, and the primacy of ruse over debate; (3) the transformation of space into a strategically useful zone, an "under- ground" permitting permanent displacement and intangibility; and</page><page sequence="6">130 • "Waldgänger Traitor, Partisan (4) radical commitment against an enemy perceived as an existential threat to one s own life and way of being. The most prominent interest informing Schmitt s essay, however, is not so much the attempt to characterize and define political and military irreg- ularity as the attempt to distinguish between a legitimate and an illegiti- mate, a heroic and a terroristic form of partisanship. Throughout the text, Schmitt insists on the distinction between the "telluric," defensive, agrar- ian, "low-tech" partisan, best embodied by the empecinados who fought the Napoleonic occupation in Spain, and the globally operating, dislocated, aggressive partisan, remote-controlled by a revolutionary party. Schmitt s typology opposes a "good" (i.e., telluric and local) to a "bad" (global, revo- lutionary) partisanship. He opposes heroes to villains: the Spanish guer- rilleros and Andreas Hofer versus the communist revolutionaries Fidel Castro and Che Guevara; the earthy anticolonialist Mao versus a Lenin scheming at the global destruction of the class enemy. The dreadful, terror- ist aspect of the "new," globalized, highly mobile, and technically well- equipped guerrilla fighter is in Schmitťs eyes the result of an ideological and totalizing concept of enmity. The revolutionary partisan has not so much a "real" but an absolute enemy, one against whom he must not only defend himself, but whom he must wipe off the face of the earth. To Schmitt, class enmity, just as racist enmity, does not allow for any confinement of enmity and warfare; it implies the annihilation of the Other, his relentless discrimination and criminalization. Communist class enmity is thus the epitome of absolute enmity in Schmitťs decidedly anti- communist bias. In a way, The Theory of the Partisan thereby pays tribute to Schmitťs dictum from The Concept of the Political : "all political concepts, representations, and words have a polemical meaning, they envisage a con- crete antithesis, are bound to a concrete situation" [. . . alle politischen Begriffe, Vorstellungen und Worte (haben) einen polemischen Sinn ; sie haben eine konkrete Gegensätzlichkeit im Auge , sind an eine konkrete Situation gebunden] (Schmitt 1996, 31). Schmitťs essay is not a neutral description or analysis of his object, but a work of distinction between the partisan as friend and as enemy, as problem or as solution. If The Theory of the Partisan can be read as a theory of political irregularity, it has to be read as the attempt to save this</page><page sequence="7">Eva Horn # 131 irregularity from the pitfalls of revolutionary politics. Schmitťs reflections on the irregular - as much as those of Boveri, Jünger, and Schroers - try to conceive of a "third option," a form of heroism and revolt without getting too close to the camp that, given the context of the fifties, seemed to have usurped all rhetoric of revolt and subversion - Communism. SLEEPERS IN THE WOODS: ERNST JÜNGER' S "DER WALDGANG" In 1951 Ernst Jünger, with his ever-acute sense for the topical, was the first to open the field of reflection from which the partisan would emerge. Jünger, extremely famous in the Weimar Republic for his aestheticizing World War I memoirs, was a member of the so-called "conservative revo- lution" that had intellectually prepared the rise of the Nazi movement. After 1945, however, Jünger had weathered surprisingly well the odium of having been one of that regime's most popular authors. Unlike Schmitt, who in the beginning of the thirties had actively and enthusiastically sought to be accepted as a political and juridical theorist by the Nazis, Jünger had nurtured an aristocratic and politically cryptic tone, one that allowed his writings during the National Socialist period to be published, even if not unequivocally welcomed. Thereafter, their allegorical and vague tone allowed his texts to be interpreted as works of "inner emigration." His 1951 text Der Waldgang seems, at first sight, to be a theory of political resistance, a subject that for obvious reasons was fashionable and intensely discussed in postwar Germany. The text starts with a strange thought experiment: Imagine an election that is so manipulated that it will, whatever the actual voter behavior, show a result of 98 percent of affirmative votes. What could a dissenting voter do? Vote "no"? This would only play into the manipu- lating government's stand, namely, that there exists a tiny nucleus of rebel- lious "inner enemies. " Moreover, participating in a humbug election would make credible the government's pseudodemocratic claim. Jünger con- structs a pseudo-choice situation that leaves the citizens no choice, impris- oning them in a dilemma of false - or rather impossible - options. Drawing this scenario of impossible, yet real, options, Jünger tries to define, in a</page><page sequence="8">132 • "Waldgänger Traitor, Partisan negative way, what the individuals real freedom [die Freiheit des Einzelnen] might be ( Jünger i960, 307). It would be the freedom not to play the power s manipulated game of suffrage (vote "yes" or "no," abstain from voting). Developing his example, Jünger dismisses the possibility of a democratic plebiscite along with those of open revolt or passive resistance. He tries to designate a third way [ein Drittes], rejecting the dichotomy of compli- ance/direct confrontation: "to howl with the wolves or to take up arms against them" [mit den Wölfen zu heulen oder gegen sie ins Feld zu ziehen] (336). Freedom, for Jünger, lies in the possibility of a way out - in his terms, "going into the woods" [Waldgang]. The "woods" is a metaphor for a polit- ical space: a space of individual defection, of Abtrünnigkeit and autonomy, a space that is a "home" and a "haven," but also a realm of radical solitude (325). The Waldgang implies a step towards freedom, but also into risk and solitude; it cuts the individual off from the state s control, but also from the warmth of social bonds. The "woods" are the underground, a hidden dimension of the political that opens new tactical options for resistance and a shelter from the state s controlling powers. They are the maquis, the landscape in which only the partisan knows the way: a hiding place, a sanc- tuary. Schmitt gratefully recognizes in Jünger 's "woods" the realm of the partisan. He sees the Waldgänger as a successor of Jünger s first great Gestalt, outlined in his essay The Worker (1932).3 In a footnote on Jünger s text, he uses its author s tendency metaphorically to inflate his concepts by filling them with almost any possible significance so as to borrow for his partisan a spiritual, if not a theological glamour. Interestingly, Schmitt does not quote chapter 29 of Der Waldgang, which very explicitly and in precise mil- itary terms deals with partisanship as "going into the woods," but high- lights Jünger 's more disturbing examples of such woods: the garden of Gethsemane and Socrates' Daimonion (Schmitt 1995, 2,6 n. 16). To Schmitt, the Jüngerian "woods" are interesting as zones of reflection and preparation - preparation, however, for death and self-sacrifice. The partisan as Waldgänger suddenly - implicitly - gains the aura of a savior or of a martyr for his philosophical or religious beliefs. Nevertheless, the Waldgänger is not an accomplished savior, a rebel, or revolutionary. In a</page><page sequence="9">Eva Horn # 133 strikingly vague but lucid phrase, Jünger explains what he means by the "woods": "One might say that man sleeps in the woods" [Man kann auch sagen, daß der Mensch im Walde schläft], he writes, strangely accentuating the word "sleeps" (Jünger i960, 324). Why sleeps? The realm of the Waldgänger is a space not so much of action, but of passive abandonment, of sleep, perchance of dreams. In this phrase, Jünger grasps the very essence of his Waldgäng : the woods are a space of open possibilities, of preparation, of infinitely forking paths. The woods are the space of political latency, a zone of proto-enmity, where the enemy, the "real" enemy, remains to be defined and recognized. "The woods are secret" [Der Wald ist heimlich], writes Jünger (339). The Waldgänger is thus the secret-keeper of a latent option or action, a still-untaken decision. He is a waiting rebel, a lurking partisan, a sleeper - perhaps the messiah or the philosopher, prepared to empty the self- sacrificial cup which will not pass. Yet he is what he is, not manifestly, but in a secret, invisible, not-yet-emerging form. Recognizing in Jünger 's Waldgänger a sibling or antecedent of his partisan, Schmitt implic- itly illuminates a dimension of political irregularity: latency. The irregular is a hidden state of the political, one withdrawn from public representa- tion. He hasn't even entered the political sphere yet, but is in a state that could be called protopolitical. The partisan's nonuniformed invisibility, his hiding in a familiar landscape or amongst civilians - primary proof of his irregularity in Schmitt's eyes - is thus more than just a military ruse: his invisibility is the essence of military and political latency. It is the structure of this "sleep," this waiting, that allows for an entirely autonomous, or - as Schmitt puts it - "concrete" choice of his "real" enemies, but not for an ide- ologically intoxicated form of "absolute" enmity. If the partisan is a "sav- ior," an irregular come to disrupt the all-too-regular state of Cold War politics, he is so inasmuch as he does not openly promote a political pro- gram, inasmuch as he does not concede the false options of the given camps and positions, but tends his initiative and thereby opens a new field of political potentialities. For by leaving the thickets of those sleepy woods of political latency, the partisan loses his innocence and becomes entangled in the hedgerows of tragic choices.</page><page sequence="10">134 • "Waldgänger Traitor, Partisan BETWEEN THE FRONT LINES: MARGRET BOVERTS "TREASON IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY" Margret Boveri's famous four-volume work, Treason in the Twentieth Century (1961), deals with the Waldgänger in his less blissful and heroic but rather fallen and tragic state. Schmitt quotes her writings several times in his Theory of the Partisan , nevertheless rather camouflaging than admitting the great debt his reflections on political irregularity owe to her extensive essay. A cosmopolitan yet stubbornly patriotic journalist - as much a friend of Schmitt as of the leftist author Uwe Johnson - Boveri had spent World War II at posts as a foreign correspondent in the United States and Sweden, writing for the liberal Frankfurter Zeitung , later for the Nazi-controlled Das Reich. After the war, she became both influential and controversial, pub- lishing important political essays in the journal Merkur .4 Certainly much more distanced from the National Socialist ideology than Schmitt or Jünger, she nevertheless always defended her decision to work for wartime German newspapers as an act of loyalty to a troubled fatherland. Her study on treason thus is an attempt to deal with the complicated, if not inextrica- ble dilemmas of allegiance that the twentieth century's political turmoil had created. The National Socialist regime confronted dissenting citizens with the alternative between risky resistance and shameful opportunism (the then so-called "inner emigration"), and now the Cold War had brought some individuals to forsake their national loyalty in favor of adherence to abstract ideologies. Her diagnosis is blunt and broad: the twentieth cen- tury, writes Boveri, is the century of treason, of broken bonds of loyalty and shaken allegiances between states and their citizens. It is precisely this dis- union between the state and its citizens, forcing the latter into a realm of irregularity, that interests Schmitt. In a long footnote in The Theory of the Partisan , he comments on Boveri's "stimulating books": "The personnel of this book is not limited to partisans. Rather the 'abysmal confusion' of a Landschaft des Verrates ( Landscape of Treachery) 'blurs hopelessly' all boundaries of legality and legitimacy, so that a general Gestalt of the parti- san becomes obvious" [Das Personal dieses Buches besteht nicht nur aus Partisanen. Aber die " abgründige Konfusion " einer Landschaft des Verrates läßt alle Grenzen von Legalität und Legitimität " heillos verschwimmen," so daß die</page><page sequence="11">Eva Horn # 135 Auftreibung zu einer allgemeinen Gestalt des Partisanen naheliegt] (Schmitt 1995, 76 n. 48). The traitor is an avatar of the partisan Gestalt. Certainly, the political personnel that Boveri portrays in her book cannot be called "par- tisans" in the technical sense of the word. Boveri aligns cases of resistance such as the German group around Graf Stauffenberg with collaborators such as the Norwegian Nazi Vidkun Quisling; secret agents such as Richard Sorge (one of Stalin's World War II spies) with T. E. Lawrence, the leader of the Arab revolt against the Ottomans (indeed one of the fathers of partisan warfare); and - examples that were still fresh in 1956's minds - the Rosenbergs and Robert J. Oppenheimer. Boveri s study is a paradoxically mixed bag of spies, traitors, renegades, defectors, fellow travelers, collabo- rators, and resistance fighters, the only common trait of whom seems to be the fact that at one point in their lives they each crossed the line of civil loy- alty to become involved with "the enemy." What Boveri calls "traitor" is a highly contradictory and heterogeneous figure that challenges the "crite- rion of the friend-enemy grouping" by his very transgression of given front lines. The traitor s irregularity, which links him to the Gestalt of the parti- san, consists in his act of- perhaps deliberate, perhaps ineluctable - defec- tion, his changing of sides. He is a friend become an enemy, an enemy in the guise of a friend. The essence of treason, as Boveri puts it, lies in a dissolu- tion of allegiance. The nations that demand their citizens' loyalty have ceased to be their "homelands" [Heimat], a familiar landscape, giving them a feeling of "belonging" [ein Zugehörigkeitsgefühl], as she writes, "which, no matter what regime was in power, remained rooted in the soil, the lan- guage, the landscape, and which was heartfelt" [. . . das unabhängig vom herrschenden Regime im Boden, in der Sprache, in der Landschaft war und eine Angelegenheit des Herzens war] (1956, 1:18). Modern nations have become abstract entities, based on "a revolutionary patriotism . . . more obedient to the head than to the heart and which has come to confound the nation with its political slogans" [revolutionärem Patriotismus . . . der vom Kopf stärker als vom Gemüt dirigiert wurde und die Nation mit einer politischen Losung identi- fizierte] (1:18). Treason is the symptom of the political decay of the "father- land" into a mere "nation" and, worse still, of the dissolution of the bonds of patriotism through the cold and abstract, but seductive power of</page><page sequence="12">136 # "Waldgänger Traitor, Partisan "Menschheitsideologien" [universal ideologies] such as communism. Modern states lack the binding power that once assured their citizens' ever- lasting faithfulness. It is in this theory of decay, in her nostalgic invocation of the ancient "fatherland," that Boveri reveals the core of her deeply con- servative beliefs.5 Even if one does not share her nostalgia and old-fash- ioned concept of patriotic allegiance, her theory of the traitor as a figure of political irregularity pinpoints another crucial aspect of this irregularity. If political regularity consists in reliable, transparent structures of "belong- ing to" and "being against," i.e., of clear-cut friend-enemy groups, the trai- tor is the embodiment of their modern ambiguity and opacity. This makes the traitor the bête noire , the specter haunting an apparently straight- forward Cold War enmity with its polarities of East against West, "com- munism" against the "free world," "social justice" against "capitalist exploitation," the two camps moreover neatly divided geographically. But one never knows who is on which side. Anybody could be an enemy, any- one a traitor: "Reds under the beds" everywhere. The traitor is no longer, as was the Waldgänger, a "latent" and potential enemy, a lone fighter on the verge of taking up arms - but an active, clandestine, and ultimately perfidious agent who abuses and betrays trust and loyalty. If the Gestalt of the partisan is characterized by his camouflage techniques and the dissolu- tion of the front line, the traitor and secret agent are his most radicalized, most insidious roles, as Schmitt recognizes in some remarks in The Theory of the Partisan: In Cold War situations he becomes the technician of an invisible battle, a saboteur and a spy. [ . . . ] A motorized partisan loses his telluric character. All he remains is a transportable, replaceable cog in the workings of a powerful world-political machine which engages him in an open or invisi- ble war and then, depending on how things are developing, switches him off again. [In den Situationen des Kalten Kriegs wird er [der Partisan] zum Techniker des unsichtbaren Kampfes, zum Saboteur und Spion. [ . . . ]] Ein solcher motorisierter Partisan verliert seinen tellurischen Charakter und ist nur noch das transportable und auswechselbare Werkzeug einer mächtigen Weltpolitik treibenden Zentrale,</page><page sequence="13">Eva Horn # 137 die ihn im offenen oder unsichtbaren Krieg einsetzt und nach Lage der Dinge wieder abschaltet]. (Schmitt 1995, 27-28) Nevertheless, and perhaps due to her nostalgic cast, Boveri, contrary to Schmitt, also sees the reverse side of what she calls "the epidemic of trea- son" ( Verrat als Epidemie - the title of volume 4, the volume on America). For it might not simply be the conscience of the individual citizen which prompts his turning to the enemy and his betrayal of his fatherland - it is the very structure of modern states and societies that makes "treason" unavoidable. The individual is "made" or declared a traitor to the extent that he participates in conflicting systems of allegiance. To Boveri, Robert Oppenheimer - father of the atomic bomb but a reluctant sire of the hydro- gen bomb, member of the international scientific community of physicists but also member of the U.S. Army, friend of members of the American Communist Party and yet celebrated as the man who built the weapon to end World War II - is the exemplary case of someone who could not help slipping between the front lines. As Boveri writes: Whatever he did was used against him by some side as evidence of treason or infamy. Un-American his antifascism, his support for Spanish Republicanism, his friendship with Communists. Impious his research work, the arrogance of a twentieth century Lucifer towards God's Creation. Genocide his development of the atomic bomb. A national security risk his threefold refusal to name Chevalier. Betrayal of a friend his eventual desig- nation of Chevalier. Again a security risk with his lack of enthusiasm for the hydrogen bomb. Repeatedly complicit with genocide as that reluctance finally fades. [ . . . alles ist ihm von irgendeiner Seite als Verrat oder Übeltat ausgelegt worden. Der Antifaschismus, die Spanienhilfe , die Freundschaft mit Kommunisten: als Verrat am Amerikanismus. Die physikalische Arbeit: als Überheblichkeit des ent- fesselten Menschen im 20. Jahrhundert gegenüber der Schöpfung Gottes. Das Entwickeln der Atomwaffe: Genocid. Die dreimalige Weigerung, Chevalier zu nen- nen: Gefährdung der Sicherheit der Nation. Die Nennung von Chevaliers Namen: Auslieferung des Freundes.

Die doch noch durchgebrochene Begeisterung für die H-Bombe: Verstärkte Beihilfe zum Genocid ]. (Boveri i960, 4:276) From the very moment that he became involved with modern forms of social adherence, i.e., with modern forms of enmity - more precisely, with modern forms of social adherence - Robert Oppenheimer was doomed always to stand accused of somehow being on the wrong side. In her theory of treason in the twentieth century, Oppenheimer is Boveri's conclusive proof that one cannot avoid becoming a traitor. One cannot help getting caught between the front lines; one cannot help getting one's hands dirty. INTERESTED THIRD PARTIES: ROLF SCHROERS'S "DER PARTISAN" While Boveri's extensive collection of case studies focuses on the individ- ual as the heroic - but predominantly tragic - agent of political irregular- ity, Rolf Schroers's 1961 book Der Partisan makes an attempt at a broad phenomenology of what one might call "partisan behavior." From Schmitt's extensive quotations, it becomes relatively clear that it was Schroers's study that suggested the partisan to him as a figure for his reflections on irregularity. Rolf Schroers, journalist, author of novels and radio plays, active mem- ber of the F.D.P. - West Germany's small liberal (though not leftist) party - and editor of the party journal Liberal, had been fascinated by the figure of the partisan ever since the end of the war. In 1949 he published a biography of T. E. Lawrence, the British Empire agent who became the military and spiritual leader of the Arab revolt against the Turks in 1916 and one of the most successful strategists (and theorists) of partisan warfare.6 Throughout his life, Schroers returned to Lawrence as the epitome of partisan heroism and cunning, but he also insisted on the risk and unsustainability of the par- tisan existence. Lawrence, whose absence from Schmitt's study is odd enough in itself, is the textbook example of the partisan's essential solitude: caught between two loyalties, one towards the Arab insurrectionists, the other towards his British commanders, he ended up driven to despair by</page><page sequence="15">Eva Horn # 139 feelings of shame and betrayal.7 Even in his military triumphs, even in his fame, the partisan remains a tragic figure: his cause is lost just as his exis- tence is consumed in the act of mere revolt. Unlike Schmitt, Schroers is not so much interested in specifying, hon- ing the characteristics and the juridical and political implications of parti- san warfare. To Schroers, the partisan is a figure of rebellion against another Gestalt , "the mechanic" [der Maschinist] who exhibits an uncanny resemblance to Jünger s "worker" [der Arbeiter). The partisan is the antag- onist of the mechanic, who embodies the manipulations of modern mech- anized power, the technological format of war in the age of ABC weapons, and the creep of administrative control over society. More than Schmitťs Theory of the Partisan, Schroers s book is a thorough criticism of Cold War culture: the technicization of warfare that negates all human agency and control; ideological conformism, consumerism, and opportunism; unlim- ited technological optimism. To Schroers, the partisan is the figure of autonomy [Mündigkeit] ; in opposition to his environment, he is necessarily a loner, a terrorist if need be, essentially opposed to any kind of organiza- tion, skirting the fringes of anarchism. The partisan learns that "order can be inimical, it can infringe on rights which he unthinkingly enjoyed. He thus begins - anarchistically - to perceive order as something inherently dubious" [Ordnung feindlich sein kann, daß sie Rechte schmälert , die er unbe- fangen genoß. So wird ihm - anarchisch - Ordnung als Ordnung zweifelhaft] (Schroers 1961, 148). He is not a revolutionary fighter, as he has no political agenda and is not a member of any party. Being isolated, he is necessarily condemned to clandestinity. The core of Schroers's interest in the partisan lies in his essentially antiorganizational and antitechnological aspect. Political irregularity, in Schroers's view, is an act of controlled anarchism, the lonely rebellion of the human individual against an overwhelming mechanization of the world. This is the reason why he explicitly calls his book a "study in political anthropology." Schroers is interested in the human being, the existentialist homme révolté (Camus): lonely, desperate, consumed in the act of self-liberation. Carl Schmitt does not share Schroers's existentialist and humanist approach, but nevertheless borrows from Schroers not only his</page><page sequence="16">140 # "Waldgänger Traitor, Partisan antitechnological impulse but also the concept of the "interested third party" [interessierter Dritter] (Schmitt 1995, 78). This concept is crucial to a theory of political irregularity, as it concerns the relationship of the regular to the irregular. The "interested third party" is the "regular power" that the irregular partisan forces depend on, logistically and ideologically. The par- tisan needs not only the technical support (mainly weapons) but also the recognition - through another state - of the legitimate character of his cause: "... the irregular must ultimately legitimize itself through the regu- lar" [Auf längere Sicht muss sich das Irreguläre am Regulären legitimieren]. It is this "interested third party," the force of regularity as the ally of the irregu- lar, that perverts the dignity of the lonesome, defensive, earthy partisan. It infects the purity and the telluric character of partisanship with the poison, the ideological biases, and base interests of world politics. With the techni- cal support of the interested third party, the partisan becomes a technically well-equipped, highly mobilized, globally aggressive agent: To the degree to which the partisan becomes motorized, he loses his soil, and his dependency on the technical and industrial means required for his struggle grows. The power of the interested third party grows accordingly until it finally attains planetary dimensions. All of the perspectives through which we have hitherto observed present-day partisanship are thus sub- sumed under an absolutely predominant technical aspect. [In dem Mafie wie der Partisan sich motorisiert, verliert er seinen Boden und wächst seine Abhängigkeit von den technisch-industriellen Mitteln , deren er für seinen Kampf bedarf. Damit wächst auch die Macht des interessierten Dritten, so dafi sie schließlich planetarische Ausmaße erreicht. Sämtliche Aspekte, unter denen wir das heutige Partisanentum bisher betrachtet haben, scheinen dadurch in dem alles beherrschenden technischen Aspekt aufzugehen]. (Schmitt 1995, 79) But it is not only the "technical aspect" whose predominance reveals the perversion, the decay of a defensive partisanship into a mobilized, aggres- sive one. Even more disturbing is the transformation of partisan enmity, its slight but decisive shift at the very moment when a national or global rela- tion of enmity supplements or inserts itself into a given local conflict. The</page><page sequence="17">Eva Horn # 141 interested third party - never genuinely interested in the partisans "cause" but using him to his own ends - provides the international "recognition" for the latter s struggle (preserving him from the status of a mere criminal), but also subordinates his "real" enmity (e.g., that between freedom fighters and a colonial power) to the constraints of a global system of preestab- lished alliances and antagonisms. At this point, local enmity turns into global enmity - and that means that the conflict cannot be ended on a local scale. The patronage that decouples the partisans irregularity by restaging it in a global secret war simultaneously coerces his "real" enmity into an abstract and annihilating "absolute" enmity. At this point, the partisan, fascinating as irregularity's Gestalt , stumbles into the logic of Cold War politics. He is the human counterpart to the ABC weapons: "the supracon- ventional weapon presupposes the supraconventional human" [die supra- konventionelle Waffe supponiert den suprakonventionellen Menschen] writes Schmitt in his conclusive remarks (Schmitt 1995, 95-96). He alludes to the catastrophe of World War I where, without a preexisting "real" enmity, much of mankind stumbled into an unstoppable war that, by the momen- tum of its annihilating weapons technology, fostered "total" enmity and destruction.8 If the partisan is a figure of salvation, the interested third party, in Schmitt's sometimes slightly theological interpretations, is assigned the role of Satan, the tempter who would lure the partisan into the perdition of mundane conventional politics. Irregularity, military and political, is a difficult thing to conceive. Its Gestalt cannot shake his ambivalence: hero or traitor, telluric or active on a global scale, defensive or aggressive, lonely or trapped in false alliances. The liberal and conservative West German intellectuals who inspire Schmitt are fascinated by this figure of political irregularity, and yet cannot think of him in terms other than of tragic conflict (Boveri), existentialist act of revolt (Schroers), or almost apolitical seclusion (Jünger). The difficulty for them lies in an unwillingness to accept the inner dynamics of irregularity: its tendency not only to dissolve front lines and classical distinctions such as combatants vs. noncombatants, war vs. peace, etc., but permanently to broaden its own focus. Thus an anticolonial revolt against an occupying force may well turn into an anticapitalist revolutionary movement. The</page><page sequence="18">142 # "Waldgänger Traitor, Partisan force of irregularity is not limited to solitary and doomed - yet heroic - revolts. The question is: how can one think of revolt without promulgating revolution? This is the bugbear dilemma of the fifties: how can one think of an alternative to the Western political setup without falling into the camp of Communism? Schmitt, less nostalgic and existentialist than his fellow writers, sees this as a problem that can only be dealt with in the "con- crete" situation, i.e., in war. What he suggests is a criterion serving to dis- tinguish the good partisan from the bad, how to treat both legally and politically. In this sense The Theory of the Partisan is not just a treatise of political reflection , but a political and polemical weapon. Paradoxically, it is a theory of irregularity that aims at regulating the field of irregularity itself. Schmitťs text thus perfectly fulfills his own definition of the "political," treating as it does the definition and recognition of the enemy. His "real" enemy is the global, revolutionary partisan, also known as the Communist. And Schmitt fights him in characteristic manner, celebrating one figure of irregularity while dismissing the other. You can only fight a partisan with a partisan. A corsaire, corsaire et demi.
