NEW PERSPECTIVES ON THE LATE CLASSIC POLITICAL HISTORY OF QUIRIGUA, GUATEMALA Matthew G. Looper Department of Art and Art History, California State University at Chico, Chico, CA 95929-0820, USA Abstract This article summarizes the Late Classic history of the Maya city of Quirigua, Izabal, Guatemala, emphasizing its relations with other polities. Quirigua's origins as a kingdom are traced to a.d. 426, when the rulers of nearby Copan established it as a colony. For the next three centuries, the site apparently mediated an intense interaction between Copan and Tikal. In a.d. 736, a personage from Tikal's rival city, Calakmul, acted with the current king of Quirigua—Buts' Tiliw—shortly before his a.d. 738 revolt against Copan. This suggests that Quirigua's revolt may have been, in part, externally stimulated. The revolt of Quirigua against Copan initiated a series of wars by Buts' Tiliw and his successor, Sky Xul, directed against two unknown sites. At least one of these sites was probably within the Copan hegemony. In contrast to the reigns of Buts' Tiliw and Sky Xul, that of the last known king of Quirigua, Jade Sky, seems to have been free of warfare. In fact, in his final monumental text, Jade Sky indicated his reconciliation with Copan. This interpretation of the texts of Quirigua suggests that changes in alliance and wars played an important role in the development of the site during the Late Classic period. Since the discovery of Quirigua in 1840 by the English artist Fred erick Catherwood, many circumstances have facilitated studies of the history of this ancient Maya city, located on the banks of the Motagua River in the department of Izabal, Guatemala. The nu merous schist and sandstone monuments that adorn the site core feature lengthy hieroglyphic texts that have, in general, fared well against the damaging forces of erosion and plant growth. Further, the placement of permanent guardians at the site early in this cen tury has prevented looting and major vandalism of the monu ments. Most important, the early archaeological expeditions to the site went to considerable lengths to document the sculptures by means of photographs and casts.1 Drawings resulting from the most important of these projects, that of Alfred P. Maudslay between 1881 and 1894 (Maudslay 1889-1902), served investigators as the major tool for analysis of Quirigua history for nearly a century. The lords who ruled ancient Quirigua commissioned no fewer than 20 separate carved texts to celebrate anniversaries of the sa cred calendar, or "period endings." In contrast, few "historical" dates are known from the texts of the site. Most prominent of the non-period-ending events previously recognized at Quirigua fell within the reign of the king Buts' Tiliw (formerly referred to as "Kawak Sky"), who ruled for most of the eighth century a.d.2 Be cause Buts' Tiliw was responsible for erecting most of the monu ments at the site, this king's hieroglyphic chronicles have come to dominate our notions of the site's history. In particular, repetitive accounts of this Quirigua ruler's victory over his former overlord at Copan, referred to by researchers as 18 Rabbit, led modern ar chaeologists and historians to believe that the Late Classic politi cal history of Quirigua hinged upon this single event. In fact, modern reconstructions of the history of Quirigua tended to focus on this event alone, summarizing it as a textbook example of an internecine struggle and rebellion. Archaeological evidence ac crued by the University of Pennsylvania Quirigua Project of 1974 1979 seems to corroborate the textual data, attributing the vast majority of construction at the site to the eighth century.3 Although the rhetoric of the hieroglyphic texts at Quirigua clearly implies that the defeat of 18 Rabbit was key to the prestige of its Late Classic kings, we must remember that Buts' Tiliw's emphasis on the defeat of the Copan ruler merely served his own political purposes at the time of the monuments' dedications. Al 1 The most important early investigations at Quirigua were those of Alfred Maudslay and the excavations sponsored by the School of Ameri can Archaeology and the Archaeological Institute of America under the direction of Edgar Lee Hewett and Sylvanus G. Morley between 1910 and 1914. The photographs taken by Maudslay were published in Maudslay (1889-1902), and the casts resulting from his work at the site are con served in the British Museum. The photographs taken by Jesse L. Nus baum in the context of the School of American Archaeology/Archaeological Institute of America expedition remain unpublished, for the most part, and are preserved in the History Library of the Museum of New Mexico, Santa Fe. The photographs taken by Morley were published in Morley (1937— 1938). Casts resulting from this project are displayed in the San Diego Museum of Man. 2 David Kelley (1962) first identified this ruler, dubbing him "Ruler I" or "Two-legged Sky." The "Cauac Sky" nickname was offered by Sharer (1978). The full name of this ruler probably reads Buts' Tiliw Chan Yoat (see Grube et al. 1991). In Chontal, til-e(n) means "to burn something" (Knowles 1984), suggesting that the first part of the king's name may be translated "Smoke Burned" (the -iw suffix is adjectival). This phrase mod ifies the second portion of the name, which refers to a type of chak light ning deity. In this paper, I have taken the liberty of shortening this cumbersome name to Buts' Tiliw. 1 On the Pennsylvania project at Quirigua, see the three volumes of the Quiriguá Reports series: Ashmore (1979), Schortman and Urban (1983), and Schortman (1993).

In order to enrich our reconstruction of Qurigua's history, therefore, we must examine the texts of the kings who succeeded Buts' Tiliw to the throne of Quirigua. These texts yield data that allow us to identify additional factors that may have motivated and sustained the growth of the small site during its century of independence. This paper provides new interpretations of the political history of Late Clas sic Quirigua, based especially on a reanalysis of the texts of later monuments from the site that was undertaken recently in the con text of my doctoral dissertation on the sculpture programs of Buts' Tiliw (Looper 1995a). As previous documentation of the texts of Quirigua through drawings was incomplete and often inaccurate, especially in the case of later monuments such as Stela I, Zoo morphs G and P, and Altars O' and P', the present investigation focused on examination and redrawing of the original monuments at the site itself. Photographs and casts of the monuments taken by previous expeditions were also consulted to clarify details that are now eroded. The conclusions reported in this study suggest that Quirigua's success in the Late Classic may be related to political decisions of its kings that reached far beyond the valley of the Motagua, into the domains of other holy lords, both ally and enemy. EARLY CLASSIC BACKGROUND: A VASSAL KINGDOM In order to understand the political developments at Quirigua dur ing the Late Classic period, it is essential to establish their origins in the dynamics of the Early Classic period. For, although Quirigua's era of major growth corresponds to the Late Classic, its political foundations extend to the early fifth century a.d. Both archaeo logical and epigraphic studies document the presence of an elite Maya center at Quirigua at this time. Excavations to the north of the presently visible floodplain center revealed two groups—3C-7 and 3C-8—that featured typically Early Classic construction style and ceramic associations, and probably represent the Early Clas sic site epicenter (Ashmore 1984, 1987). A stela found in the vi cinity of Group 3C-7, Monument 26, may be dated to 9.3.0.0.0 in the Maya long count, or a.d. January 30, 495.4 The text of this monument (Figure 1) tells of the accession of a "fourth successor" on a date in late a.d. 493, implying that a royal dynasty had been established at Quirigua at an earlier date.5 Although no monuments attributed to the founder of the Quiri gua dynasty are known, the inscription of the Late Classic Stela C (Figure 2) features a record of a period-ending festival on 9.1.0.0.0 (August 28,455) celebrated by a person named Tutum Yol K'inich, C D 6 3rd successor was made lord 4th succcssor zl 72 z3 chokhi, [kan] k'ul scattered, [sky] god kab k'ul earth god Figure i. Text of Quirigua Monument 26 (drawing by the author]. 4 Although Monument 26 bears an initial-series date earlier than 9.3.0.0.0, the text concludes with the "scattering" verb (Czl) and a "sky god, earth-god" combination (Dzl-Cz2). Because these passages appear elsewhere only in the context of period endings, it is highly likely that the broken areas just above the scattering expression included calendrical data that brought the date forward to the 9.3.0.0.0 katun ending, when the mon ument was dedicated. This study uses the correlation constant of 584285. 5 The initial-series date of Monument 26, which corresponds to the accession date, is preserved only up to the winal: 9.2.18.13.??. Noting that the haab patron is clearly that for Zac and that the Glyph G located at Az3 is clearly G9, Scheie (1990c) calculated that the only two possibilities for the initial series are 9.2.18.13.1 11 Imix 4 Zac (October 28, 493) and 9.2.18.13.10 7 Oc 13 Zac (November 6, 493). See also Jones (1983a) and Looper (1995a:40) for comments on this date. Jones and Sharer (1980:15) identified the "fourth successor" reference of this text, while Scheie (1990c) identified the action as accession.</page><page sequence="3">Political history of Quirigua 265 6 Ahaw ut/.'apwa planted Vol-K'inich utiy 9 happened at t/.'un(u) hummingbird 10 f " 13 Yaxk'in tun, Tutum stone, Tutum k'ul T/.uk ahaw holy Quirigua lord ?

A second retrospective reference to this founder may appear in the text of the Late Classic Zoomorph P, in the cartouches surrounding the eyes and muzzle on the north end of the monster that the zoomorph represents (Fig ure 3). In Cartouches 7 and 6 of Zoomorph P are written two dates, 8.19.10.10.17 5 Caban 15 Yaxkin and 8.19.10.11.0 8 Ahau 18 Yaxkin (September 6 and 9, 426). These dates also appear on Co pan Altar Q, in association with the founding of the Copan dy nasty (Stone 1986; Stuart and Scheie 1986). The Cartouche 7 event has been deciphered as an arrival at the lineage shrine of Copan, followed in Cartouche 6 by the erection of a stone monument, an event that may have marked the founding of Quirigua (Grube et al. 1991).6 The next cartouche (5) gives the name of the agent of this monument dedication as Yol (TI 15.506), followed by two somewhat eroded signs. Given the proximity of the dates of these actions and the event recorded on Stela C, it is possible that this name is a reduced form of that attributed to the founder on Stela C (Looper and Scheie 1994). The Zoomorph P text continues with an ukahi1 (Tl.526:126) agency expression indicating that the setting of the stone was un cartouche 7 cartouche 6 5 Kaban 15 Yaxk'in (8.19.10.10.17) iwal tali, ch'ok te' nah and then arrived, sprout-tree-house 8 Ahaw 18 Yaxk'in (8.19.10.11.0) utz'apwa tun, u k'a oi planted stone, finished three Yol to? ? ukahi u-?-wa by the doing of ?

The account of Zoomorph P, therefore, reveals that the founding of the Quiri gua dynasty not only took place under the auspices of the Copan dynastic founder, but was also undertaken in conjunction with im portant founding rites for the dynasty of Copan. From the point of view of the Late Classic rulers of Quirigua. the simultaneous found ing of the two cities was cited as a claim to legitimacy. From a broader perspective, however, the account supports the contention stated long ago by Spinden (1913:175), that Quirigua began as a colony of Copan.8 The identification of Quirigua as an outpost of Copan is sup ported by epigraphic data from the earliest known inscribed mon 6 A second verb follows the monument erection clause in Cartouche 6. This verb consists of the "flat hand" verb superfixed by "3." The recent decipherment of this verb as k'a or k'al, meaning "finished," or "closed," yields an interpretation of this second clause as "were finished, the three," a possible reference to the three days that had elapsed between the two dates that initiate the text. 7 The "ukahi" agency expression was originally linked to the root kab, "town, place, world," by Kelley (1962), following the suggestions of Tati ana Proskouriakoff. Scheie (1982) offered the paraphrase "under the aus pices of" for the glyph. For many years, various epigraphers, including David Stuart, Nikolai Grube, William Norman, John Fox, and John Just eson, have linked the sign to the Mayan root kah, "to make, to do, to be gin," although there is still considerable debate regarding its morphology and its semantic and phonetic value. For a more detailed discussion of the expression, see Scheie and Grube (1994:17a—18). 8 It should be noted that Spinden's supposition was supported primar ily by the similarities of Late Classic sculptural traditions at the two cities. Morley (1935:26, 31) also supposed that Quirigua was a colony of Copan, founded in the late seventh century a.d..</page><page sequence="4">266 Looper ument at Quirigua, designated Stela U by its discoverer, Morley (1935:49) (Figure 4). The monument was found on Group A (Lo cus 002), a hilltop site located west of the floodplain center, in association with construction and ceramics dating to the Early Clas sic period (Ashmore 1980b:36-42, 1981; Sharer et al. 1983:43). The text of this monument begins with a truncated initial series, recording what must be 9 baktuns, 2 katuns, an eroded number of tuns, and the reversed calendar round of 8 Pop 10 Ahau.9 This date is probably 9.2.5.0.0 10 Ahau 8 Pop, or April 18, 480.10 After a glyph that is perhaps G9 of the lunar series, a T550 "tun-shell" verb with the iyuwal focus marker appears at A6. The T550 verb is used in the 819-day count and dedication passages at Tikal and Piedras Negras to indicate "placement." In the context of Stela U, it is used to establish a new date, 9 Ahau, which appears next at B5a. The next 9 Ahau date to follow the initial series date is 9 Other examples of early monuments that feature reversed calendar round dates are the Hauberg Stela (Scheie and Miller 1986:191) and Co pan Stela 16 (Scheie 1990a). 10 Morley (1935:49) misread the tzolkin coefficient as 9 and missed the haab altogether, providing a solution of 9.2.3.8.0 9 Ahau 18 Ch'en. Scheie (1990c) recognized the haab as 8 Pop, but still read the tzolkin as 9 Ahau, yielding the solution of 9.2.17.3.0.

The next few blocks of the text include names and titles of the protagonist, who is presumably the local lord.11 The final two blocks of the inscrip tion consist of an expression that assigns authority to a second per sonage. Named only by a title that probably reads ochk'in kalom te\ this agent is likely the king of Copan (Scheie 1990c).12 This title is not borne by any known ruler of Quirigua, and is tradition ally attributed to the high kings of Copan, including the founder, Yax K'uk' Mo', as on Copan Stela 15.13 Quirigua Stela U, there fore, gives contemporary confirmation that the early lords of the site were subordinate to those of Copan.14 The text of a small circular altar commissioned by a later ruler of Quirigua indicates that this subordinate status continued into the Late Classic period (Stuart 1987). Known as Altar L (Fig ure 5), this monument dates to around 9.11.0.11.11 9 Chuen 14 Tzec (June 2, 653; Satterthwaite 1979), but includes the name of the twelfth successor of the Copan dynasty, Smoke Imix God K, in conjunction with the katun ending 9.11.0.0.0 12 Ahau 8 Ceh (Stuart 1987). On this period ending at Copan, Smoke Imix God K erected an ambitious program of seven stelae in both site core and valley periphery. Given the political significance of the Copan rul er's program as an expression of the territorial integrity of the Co pan polity, the inclusion of Quirigua Altar L in this program implies the unity of Quirigua within the Copan political sphere, and prob ably its subordination to the larger site.15 When viewed from a non-epigraphic perspective, it is evident that Quirigua maintained contacts with sites in addition to Copan in the Early Classic. Indeed, Ashmore (1980b:41, 1984:373; see 11 Although the lord named here does not bear a numbered successor title, he may be the second successor of the lineage. His name, which in cludes a turtle shell followed by the (i)ts'at scribal title, is different from both the founder Tutum Yol K'inich and the third and fourth successors named on Monument 26. The reading of the "scroll-bird" title as ts'at is supported by T366 ts'a prefixes (as in the example on Stela U) and T59 ti or T103 ta postfixes (as on Sacul Stela I). (Ah) ts'at is glossed in Yucatec as "astuto" (Barrera Vásquez 1980:879). 12 The ochk'in kalom te' title has been traditionally nicknamed "west batab" or "west chak te'" (Berlin 1958; Scheie 1990b). Stuart demon strated the correct value of the "west" glyph as ochk'in, and Stuart et al. (1989) identified a full phonetic substitution for the "batab" collocation at Copan. Wagner (1995) has identified numerous additional examples of pho netic complementation that support the kalom te' reading. 13 Although kings of Tikal traditionally bore the kalom te' title, it oc curs consistently without the ochk'in "west" qualifier. Copan rulers were sometimes called "south kalom te'," as well as "west kalom te'." 14 It is likely, as well, that the frontal poses of the rulers shown on Quirigua Stela U and Monument 26 derive from such prototypes as Copan Stelae 53 and 60 (Scheie 1990a), rather than the more distant source of Uaxactun Stela 20, as proposed by William Coe (in Jones and Sharer 1980). On the other hand, it is probable that the wraparound composition typical of Early Classic Quirigua sculpture is adapted from Tikal prototypes. This derivation supports the reconstruction of Quirigua as a mediator between Tikal and Copan in the Early Classic. 15 For political interpretations of Smoke Imix God K's 9.11.0.0.0 stela program, see Marcus (1976:129), Baudez (1986:20), Fash (1983), Scheie and Grube (1988), and Newsome (1991:172-199). It should also be noted that elite contacts between Quirigua and Tikal continued into the seventh century. Becker (1972) noted that the layout of the new acropolis at Qui rigua, built at the end of the seventh century, followed a model seen at Tikal. Designated "Plaza Plan 2," this layout features temples on fhe south, east, and west sides of a plaza, the eastern building serving as a shrine for a burial located underneath. The seventh-century ceramic complex at Qui rigua is also observed to have similarities to Tepeu 1 of the Peten (Ash more 1984:378; Willey et al. 1980).</page><page sequence="5">Political history of Quiligua 267 D H Figure 5. Quirigua Altar L (drawing by the author). also Ashmore et al. 1983:59) has pointed to marked similarities in caching practices, jade artifacts, cache vessels, and utility vessels between Copan and Quirigua. Nevertheless, Quirigua exhibits sev eral features that link it to traditions of the central Peten. Of par ticular significance is the observation that some of the locally manufactured Early Classic polychrome bowls found at Quirigua have similarities to late Tzakol wares from the Peten (Ashmore 1980b:42; Ashmore et al. 1983:60). Interestingly, a simultaneous borrowing of Peten ceramic styles has been documented at Copan (Coggins 1988). Such influence parallels the introduction into Co pan of forms of architecture, monumental modes, and Tlaloc Venus war iconography typical of the central Peten and, specifically, Tikal.16 Most explicitly, in the inscription of the floor marker placed in front of the early temple at Copan nicknamed Motmot, dedica tion rites are said to take place at a location called Ho' Mutul Na Chan Mo', Mutul being spelled using the main sign of the Tikal Emblem Glyph (T569).17 Almost certainly, the Ho' Mutul Na ("Five Tikal Edifice") names the Motmot temple itself, which is deco rated with apron moldings executed in a style typical of Tikal. In sum, both Quirigua and Copan show signs of strong influ ence from the central Peten in the Early Classic period. At Copan, these features are particularly marked; epigraphic evidence favors interaction specifically with Tikal. The mimicking of Peten-style polychrome bowls at Quirigua, then, would seem not to be an in dependent development, but rather arise within the context of Quirigua's status as a colony of Copan, which itself had interests in the Maya heartland. The conjoining of archaeological and epi graphic data suggests a modification of Ashmore's (1980a:27) vision of Quirigua in the Early Classic as a "meeting ground" between Copan and the Peten. Specifically, Copan elites seem to have es tablished Quirigua in order to mediate their own interaction with Tikal. In fact, Quirigua's geographical position astride both the Motagua valley and the most direct route from Copan to the Peten made it a strategic site, perhaps serving as a commercial and dip lomatic nexus between the southeastern and central regions of the Maya world (Ashmore 1980a, 1981; Sharer 1978). 16 Sedat and Sharer (1994:2) noted that architectural features of the Early Classic Margarita platform in the Copan acropolis are "fully within the Early Classic architectural style of the central Peten." Sharer (personal communication 1995) reported that a second Copan acropolis structure (Yehnal) also exhibits a central Peten style. In a recent series of articles, Federico Fahsen, Nikolai Grube, and Linda Scheie presented a variety of epigraphic and iconographic evidence in support of the conclusion that Tikal and Copan interacted intensively beginning in the Early Classic (Fahsen et al. 1995; Grube et al. 1995; Scheie, Fahsen, and Grube 1994; Scheie, Grube, and Fahsen 1994, 1995). 17 The reading of the main sign of the Tikal Emblem Glyph as mutul was suggested by David Stuart (personal communication 1994).</page><page sequence="6">268 Looper received statue ukahi 18-R;ibbit done by Figure 6. The accession of Buts' Tiliw, Quirigua Stela E, A8-B9a (drawing by the author]. THE REIGN OF BUTS' TILIW FROM A.D. 725-738: REBELLION Even though we know of the accession of Buts' Tiliw only from monuments commissioned years after it took place on 9.14.13.4.17 12 Caban 5 Kayab (January 2, 725), one record of the event reg isters the fact that Quirigua's subordinate status had not changed since the Early Classic.18 The text of Stela E (Figure 6) indicates that the receiving of the statue of rulership by Buts' Tiliw was overseen by 18 Rabbit (Stuart 1987). One of the titles attributed to Buts' Tiliw on several monuments implies this subordination in a different manner. The title, which reads ek' xukpi ahaw (T95.756d:200-T747a), or "black Copan lord" (Figure 7A-C), is probably similar to other toponymic titles qualified by the color "black" that appear at Copan. Apparently, the title indicates Buts' Tiliw's identity as a provincial lord of the Copan hegemony (Scheie 1989). Additional evidence supports this supposition, document ing the presence of this title at Nim Li Punit in southern Belize, on Stela 2 (see Figure 7D; Scheie and Grube 1995:89). This evidence suggests that Quirigua, at this time, was part of a hegemony that extended over a very large territory.19 If Quirigua had remained subordinate to Copan for centuries since its founding in a.d. 426, the situation changed dramatically shortly after the accession of Buts' Tiliw. On 9.15.6.14.6 6 Cimi 4 Tzec (May 3, 738), a date that has become as famous to modern historians of the southeastern Maya region as it must have been among the ancient Maya, the texts of Quirigua trumpet the decap itation of the thirteenth ruler of the dynasty of Yax K'uk' Mo' by Buts' Tiliw (Figure 8).20 Couching his victory in terms of a sac Figure 7.

There, it is allowed only that the Copan ruler died with his flint spear and shield (Figure 9). Although writers on the ancient Maya occasionally suggest that the capture of 18 Rabbit took place on this date, there is evidence that the actual military engagement took place six days earlier. Grube et al. (1991) identified in the text of Quirigua Stela I an important passage that records events that took place on 9.15.6.14.0 13 Ahau 18 Zotz' (Figure 10). The verbal phrase associated with this date appears to indicate the "piercing"21 of an object made of wood, followed by a problematic reference to fire-drilling. The names of the recipients of the action appear as chan ahaw, k'uy nik ahaw (IV:T229.683b: 130-T604:61-T533:102-T229.683b: 130), "four lord, ceiba? flower lord," important titles from the texts of Copan (Scheie and Grube 1990; Villela 1993). The last two glyphs of Stela I refer to these entities as u k'ul Waxaklahun Ubah K'awil (T1.1016:7-XVIIl:T757-Tl 030d), "the gods of 18 Rabbit." Among the 15 ancestral kings joining Yax Pas in the bench scene of Copan Temple 11, two are shown seated on the "four lord" and "ceiba? flower lord" titles (Figure 11), suggesting that the titles refer to deified ancestors. I suggest that this passage refers to wooden im ages of the ancestral gods of Copan, which were either captured or defaced on this date. Such an interpretation is supported by ample epigraphic, iconographic, and ethnohistorical evidence for the car 21 The verb for the 9.15.6.14.0 date features the T758a variant rat head which appears in Glyph B of the lunar series and which has been shown to be phonetic ch'o. The three balls below the rat head are ma, and the T181 ha verbal suffix follows, yielding ch'omah. Grube et al. (1991) interpreted this verb as either "piercing" or "captive-taking," based on glosses in Yucatec and Choi. 18 Proskouriakoff (1973:168) first identified the accession date of Buts' Tiliw correctly. Kelley (1962) mistook the accession date for the lord's birth date ("initial date"). 19 It is probable that the political influence of Copan extended even as far as Caracol in Belize, where the name of the seventh king of Copan, Waterlily Jaguar, appears on Stela 16 (Grube 1990). 20 Morley (1975:221) first noted the importance of this date in the texts of Quirigua, and also identified the "axe verb" associated with it. Kelley (1962:238) suggested that the date recorded an important interaction be tween Quirigua and Copan, possibly of a military nature. Proskouriakoff (1973:168), however, noted the prominence of the event at Quirigua and assumed that the "axe verb" associated with the date recorded an event in which Quirigua "had the upper hand" over Copan. Marcus (1976:134 140) confirmed this suggestion by identifying on various Quirigua monu ments a title of Buts' Tiliw that refers to him as the "guardian of" 18 Rabbit. Donald Hales (in Robicsek and Hales 1981:45) first associated the "axe verb" with scenes of supernatural self-decapitation on Classic-period pot tery, and Orejel (1990) assigned the verb a phonetic value ch'ak and as sociated it with Yucatec glosses meaning "to decapitate."

Indeed, one of the most common aims of warfare, as practiced in Meso america, was the capture and destruction of these god images (Has sig 1988). Although Buts' Tiliw's accounts of his victory over Copan tout his personal role in the conflict, the defeat is registered with sur prising neutrality at Copan. Taken at their own face value and viewed in conjunction with the enormous royal portraits that ac company them, Buts' Tiliw's texts promulgate the scenario of a great victory, wrought primarily by personal will. A different pas sage of the Quirigua Stela I text provides a different interpretation of the circumstances surrounding the conflict with Copan shortly after the accession of Buts' Tiliw and explains many of the cir cumstances of Quirigua's political and economic trajectory in the Late Classic. Appearing just above the narrative concerning the capture or destruction of the Copan ancestor images is a passage that tells of the raising of a stela on the 9.15.5.0.0 period ending, an event that fell between the accession and decapitation in time US 6 Kimi 4 Tz'ek (9.15.6.14.6) 'died" tu tok' pakal 18-Rabbit in war Figure 9.

Next is a record of the stela planting, with the agent Buts' Tiliw's name written phonetically and followed by titles. The next sign carries verbal inflections and seems to be composed of a KAWAK infixed-T501 suffixed by a yi or mu and T126 yo. Given Stephen Houston's recent suggestion that the KAWAK-infixed-T501 is a phonetic syllable reading t'u, the verbal stem may be t'uy or t'um. T'um does not yield productive glosses in Mayan dictionaries. The object of this verb is named in the following block (C5): wamaw k'awil (T130:74:617a: 135.117-T1030d), probably a kind of chan te' ah aw 4 lord k'uy nik ceiba flower Figure II. Ancestral titles from Copan, detail of Copan Temple II bench [reversed] (from Scheie and Miller 1986:Plate 36a], statue.22 Finally, the agent is identified at D5 with signs consisting of the T671 chi sign with a KAWAK infix, superfixed by a T324 nab sign; and followed by k'ul ahaw (T40.168:518:130), "holy lord." The sign preceding the k'ul ahaw is of particular interest, as it is known to be a toponym of Calakmul (see Stuart and Houston 1994). Formerly read as Nab Tunich, this toponym more likely reads Chik Nab (Simon Martin, personal communication 1995; Fig ure 14). In texts from throughout the lowlands, Stuart and Hous ton (1994) found numerous examples of the Chik Nab toponym in association with the "snake" emblem glyph, which is now se curely attributed to Calakmul (see discussions in Martin and Grube [1994] and Scheie and Freidel [1990]). The Stela I text suggests that the 9.15.5.0.0 stela dedication at Quirigua involved a lord from Calakmul, a site whose greater po litical role during much of the Late Classic period has recently been characterized in terms of a long-standing rivalry with Tikal (Martin 1994; Martin and Grube 1994). Given that Copan, since the times of Yax K'uk' Mo', had been on good terms with Tikal, the appearance of a Calakmul lord at Quirigua just before the break with Copan circumstantially suggests that Quirigua's revolt was 22 On the interpretation of k'awil as "statue," see Freidel et al.

A palanquin from Naranjo, Tikai Temple 4 Lintel 2 (drawing by John Montgomery). externally stimulated, at least in part. Moreover, the juxtaposition of the reference to the Calakmul lord and the capture or destruc tion of Copan god images just below on Stela I clearly implies a connection between the two events. In the context of Calakmul's general aim to undermine the alliance network of Tikal, a conspir acy with Quirigua effectively severed the primary communication route between Tikal in the Peten and Copan. On the other hand, the sudden growth of Quirigua in the early years of Buts' Tiliw's reign, documented in the form of major new construction at the site, attests to the advantages of the new political arrangement for Quirigua (see Jones and Sharer 1986; Sharer 1978). Thus, while Calakmul likely viewed Quirigua as a ready ally to its cause, the possibility of achieving autonomous control of the Motagua Val ley trade route with help from Calakmul must have appealed to Buts' Tiliw. The eighth-century ceramic profile of Quirigua seems to register its new political situation, being virtually devoid of the polychrome decoration that typifies the ceramics of contemporary Peten and Copan (Willey et al. 1980). Not only does this ceramic "isolation" reflect the broken ties between Quirigua and Copan and Tikal in the early years of the eighth century, but also suggests that Calakmul's attitude toward Quirigua was not one of domina tion, but of mutual advantage. The above interpretations of the Stela I text also suggest solu tions to several of the major problems surrounding the subject of Quirigua-Copan affairs in the early- to mid-eighth century. First is the "David and Goliath" question, which asks how was it possible for what was apparently a very small kingdom, Quirigua, to cap ture the king of the much larger Copan.23 Further, why did Copan not avenge the loss through a counterattack against Quirigua? In recent studies of the political machinations of Calakmul during the Late Classic period, it has become apparent that an alliance with the great city often brought with it a promise of military sup port. Conversely, Calakmul's military power could be used to shore up wavering loyalties, as in the case of Naranjo (Martin and Grube 1994). Although the evidence from Quirigua is circumstantial, it is highly unlikely that Copan would have failed to retaliate had there not been an implied threat of reprisals by Calakmul. I strongly suspect that the involvement of Calakmul in Quirigua's affairs af ter the accession of Buts' Tiliw went far beyond the ritual act of stela dedication recorded retrospectively on Stela I. Calakmul prob ably not only encouraged Buts' Tiliw in his revolt against his over lord, but perhaps provided troops to undertake the mission.24 23 Population estimates for the two sites in the eighth century are a maximum of 2,000 persons in the area adjacent to the Quirigua site core (Ashmore 1980a:23, 1987:221) and 15,000-20,000 in the Copan valley (Fash 1983; Webster 1985:24). 24 The possibility of such a long-distance war campaign gains cre dence in light of other long-distance attacks by Calakmul against such sites as Palenque, the capital town of which was attacked by forces of Calakmul in a.d. 611 (Grube 1993).</page><page sequence="10">272 Looper c iwal ut, 10 Ahaw and then it happened ^ tz'apbiy u lakam ^ planted his huge tan yo at great erect penis Waman K'awil D 8 Chen, na ho' tun (9.15.5.0.0) tun, Butz'-Tiliw stone, Butz'-Tiliw k'ul Tzuk ahaw, u-?-hiy holy QuiriguA lord, (verb) Nab Cbik k'ul abaw Nab Chik holy lord Figure 13.

BUTS' TILIW'S REIGN FROM A.D. 762 TO 785: THE CAPTURE OF A WAR TROPHY In previous reconstructions of Quirigua history, the struggle be tween Copan and Quirigua in a.d. 738 was the unique known epi sode of open conflict between the two cities. Upon reexamination of the later texts of Quirigua, it is now apparent that Quirigua main tained its aggressive posture long after the early years of Buts' Tiliw's reign. The hieroglyphic inscriptions on several monu ments provide evidence that, in his later years, Buts' Tiliw may have scored another military victory—this time against a site prob ably within the Copan hegemony. The record of his victory ap pears several years after the fact on Stela E and on Altars O' and P', which were commissioned by his successor, Sky Xul (Fig ure 15). The Stela E text (see Figure 15A) records the date of the action with the calendar round 11 Imix 19 Muan (9.16.11.13.1; November 28, 762). The event appears with the verb ch'amwa (T533:670.130), "takes/receives," followed by a collocation in corporating a T733 logograph with what is probably T168 ahaw, "lord," superfix. Following this is a k'in ("sun") sign superfixed to the head of a jaguar flanked by upraised arms. Simon Martin has suggested that T733 compounds, such as appear here, are ref erences to the palanquins or litters on which deity images were Figure 14. The Chik Nab toponym: [A] Quirigua Stela I, D5a (drawing by the author]; (B) "Site Q" panel in Art Institute of Chicago, H4b (from Scheie and Miller 1986:Plate 101a]. carried into battle.25 This interpretation is supported by the exam ple of Lintel 2 at Tikal Temple IV, which shows a palanquin sup porting a huge jaguar-deity protector, that was captured from Naranjo by Ruler B of Tikal (see Figure 12; Martin 1991; see also Jones 1988:108). In the text that accompanies this image (Fig ure 16), a T733 compound (here with a hummingbird superfix) is named as the object of a verb reading bakwah (T1045:130.181), which is probably a derived form of baksah, "to cause to be siezed" (Scheie and Grube 1994:163). This event is coupled to an event read kuchi, "carried" (MacLeod 1993), and a nominal phrase con sisting of a "Nik Pilip" collocation, a "sun-jaguar" combination, and ek' hun ("Black Headband"). The next sign is uk'ul, "the god of," followed by the name of a ruler of Naranjo. This passage, then, recounts the capture of the palanquin from Naranjo, which is referred to by both T733 and "sun jaguar" compounds. In the text of Stela E, the record of palanquin capture is slightly different, but incorporates both T733 and "sun jaguar," as seen at Tikal. In ad dition, Barbara MacLeod has suggested that the upraised arms, as seen in the Stela E text, are a logograph for kuch, meaning "carry, carried." The palanquin at Quirigua may, thus, be referred to as a "palanquin lord, carried sun jaguar." Following the general "sun jaguar" reference to the palanquin on Stela E (see Figure 15A) is a glyph that identifies the specific palanquin that was taken. This compound (T168:756d: 126:130) incorporates a bat head with a KAWAK ku infix, suffixed by a T126 ya. Above the bat glyph is a T168 ahaw ("lord"), with the T130 wa complement placed at the bottom of the glyph block, indicating that the palanquin bore a lord or god from a "bat-kuy" place. The same collocation appears further along in the Stela E text (Figure 17), together with a toponym composed of a numeral six, a shell-in-hand sign, and a T86 nal (VI:T86:807).26 In this instance, the "bat-kuy" lord is mentioned as the object witnessed at the 9.17.0.0.0 period ending. The passage recording the taking of this god on Stela E concludes with an agency expression, ukahi? ch 'ahom (T1:526:246-T93:??:74), indicating that it was Buts' Ti liw who took the palanquin. The references to this event on Altars O' and P' are somewhat eroded and can be only partially read. On Altar O' (see Fig ure 15B), we see the same calendar round that appears on Stela E, 11 Imix 19 Muan, accompanied by an unclear verb. Following this are "sun jaguar" andT168:733 "palanquin lord" compounds, with the T733 compound prefixed by the numeral six.27 Next is "bat tel" ahaw, followed by the "6 shell-in-hand nal" toponym and a glyph reading ute' (Tl:78:541), "its wood?," perhaps a reference to the wood of which the palanquin or god image was made. An agency expression follows, with yichnal (T18:86:671), "in the com pany of," followed by Buts' Tiliw's name and titles. The Altar P' record of this event (see Figure 15C) follows that of O' closely, 25 At the 1990 Maya Meetings at Texas, Linda Scheie first identified the various glyphic phrases that refer to war litters or palanquins. Nikolai Grube (personal communication 1994) suggested that this passage of Qui rigua Stela E records the taking of a palanquin on which a god image was carried into battle. Although the phonetic value for the T733 palanquin glyph is uncertain, its complementation patterns suggest that it should end in 26 That this "6 shell-in-hand nal" is a location is suggested by the pres ence of the nal postfix, which frequently identifies toponyms (Stuart and Houston 1994). In addition, this place is named after a supernatural loca tion that appears in the text of Yaxchilan Hieroglyphic Stair 2, Panel 7. 27 T733 palanquins named on Seibal Stela 11 are also accompanied by numbers.</page><page sequence="11">Political history of Quirigua 273 A 11 Imix 19 Muwan ch'amwa "k'in-balam" ukahi cb'abom (9.16.11.13.1) received Xkuyahaw doingof censer "palanquin" 11 Imix 19 Muwan uch'am?

The 11 Imix 19 Muan calendar round appears first, followed by a somewhat eroded verb that may again be uch'am, "he receives." The "bat-kuy" appears next with a sign that seems to conflate the jaguar of the "sun jaguar" compound with the headband determinative that signals ahaw, or "lord." Yichnal, "in the company of," is next, followed by a titular reference to Buts' Tiliw as ñve-katun ch'ahom, or "censer." Although the "bat-kuy"/ "6 shell-in-hand nal," place cannot at this time be identified as an actual site, it is likely that it was under the control of Copan when Buts' Tiliw attacked it. A cylindrical stone fragment in the museum at Copan mentions both "bat-kuy" and the "6 shell-in-hand nal" place in association with the date 9.14.6.5.9 13 Muluc 7 Pop (February 20, 718; Figure 18; Scheie 1987). The event associated with this date is written with the "smoke-head" verb deciphered by David Stuart as puluy, "burned." The same verb is used frequently in the texts of Naranjo and else where to record the destruction of defeated towns, as well as the torture of captives. Such burning episodes may also be related to the pillaging of towns in order to extract tribute (Houston 1993b). Thus, 18 Rabbit, who was king at this time and who is mentioned on the Copan cylinder, probably defeated the "bat-^wy" site on this date, reinforcing its status as a vassal town to Copan.28 The use of the bat head to name the site that Buts' Tiliw at tacked also suggests that it was in the Copan hegemony, the Em blem Glyph of which prominently features a bat in its main sign. Based on Nikolai Grube's decipherment of the T756a bat head as phonetic xu, it is likely that the name of Copan, which is usually spelled with the syllables xu-ku-pi, is related to the term xukpi, meaning "bird" in Choi (Attinasi 1973:338; Looper 1991). Such a reading for the name of Copan suggests that it was a "place of birds," reflecting the names of various locations within it, such as "Mo' Wits" ("Macaw Mountain") and "Tukun Wits" ("Dove Moun tain") (Scheie and Grube 1990). Based on this interpretation of the Copan emblem-glyph main sign, it is possible that the bat head of the "bat-kuy" toponym signals the Choi female marker x-, which commonly precedes the names of birds. "Xku" is listed as a mod ern Choi word for "owl" (Aulie and Aulie 1978:134), but the Classic-period term for "owl" was either ku or kuy (Grube and Scheie 1994). I tentatively suggest, then, that the "bat-kuy" place may read "Xkuy" ("owl"), the bat head signaling both the conso nant X-, as well as the inclusion of the site within the Copan he gemony, the "place of birds." Buts' Tiliw's attack on Xkuy many years after his sacrifice of the Copan king implies that Quirigua's aggression against Copan took place over an extended period of time. Moreover, it shows that the interaction between the two sites fell within well-known patterns of Classic Maya warfare. Not only were war campaigns often conducted over long periods of time and in series of battles, but they were often carried out against smaller sites allied to the enemy. An example is Naranjo's attack against Yaxha on 9.13.18.4.18 (March 23, 710), as recorded on Naranjo Stela 23 28 This site could well have been located very close to Quirigua, pos sibly one of numerous small sites located on the upper reaches of the Morja river. These sites have been shown to have close contacts with Copan in the eighth century, through their use of Copador ceramics (Fash 1991:151).</page><page sequence="12">274 Looper haksah siczed nik pilip ek' bun Yax May Chan Chak "sun-jaguar" u k'ul god of Sak Chnen kuchiy carried Figure 16. Palanquin events from Tikal: Tikal Temple 4 Lintel 2, B10-B14 [drawing by John Montgomery]. (Scheie and Freidel 1990:191-192). The text suggests that the Yaxha ruler's wife was from Tikal.29 Buts' Tiliw's attack against Xkuy in a.d. 762 also provides circumstantial support for the involvement of Calakmul in Quirigua's affairs after a.d. 736, as such involve ment would have discouraged Copan from avenging both the sac rifice of their king and attacks against its satellites, such as Xkuy. With the protection of Calakmul, Buts' Tiliw could attack the Co pan hegemony with impunity, gaining not only trophies, tribute, and prestige for Quirigua, but also serving Calakmul's relentless campaign to destabilize Tikal and its allies. The fact that the capture of the Xkuy palanquin was recorded three times in the texts of Quirigua attests to the great prestige attributed to possession of the object. In fact, it would appear that the trophy was displayed publicly on various occasions, probably as part of ritual pageants. Above, it was mentioned that the Stela E text records the witnessing of the palanquin on the 9.17.0.0.0 pe riod ending (see Figure 17). However, the text from Zoomorph G, the death monument for Buts' Tiliw, records that the image was once again displayed on the day the king died. The event appears following the date 11 Ik 5 Yax (9.17.14.13.2; July 31, 785) and a very complicated death expression (Figure 19). It begins with a glyph reading yilahi (T18:833:88), "he witnessed," followed once again by the "sun jaguar" compound with upraised arms, the T733 compound and Xkuy ahaw, a title that probably reads To' ahaw Figure 17. The witnessing of the palanquin from Xkuy on the 9.17.0.0.0 period ending, Quirigua Stela E, A20b-B20 [drawing by the author). (T168:44:694),30 and another noble title. Evidently, the trophy cap tured from Xkuy was so highly prized that it was brought out into public view to commemorate the death of the great king who had captured it many years before. Such a tradition of public display of a palanquin upon the death of a Maya king may be related to similar behavior documented archaeologically. Excavation of Río Azul Tomb 19 showed that the body was carried into the tomb on a simple litter composed of wooden poles (Hall 1986:88). In Tikal Burial 196, the remains of four carved, stuccoed, painted wooden panels were interpreted by Coggins (1975:345) to be part of a platform for a portable throne or palanquin.31 In the case of this palanquin, the parallel to Qui rigua is especially close, as the palanquin at Tikal bears a 9.8.0.0.0 calendric notation (Coggins 1975:346). The ruler interred in Burial 196 is now known to have been alive until at least 9.9.15.0.0, when his name appears on Altar de Sacrificios Stela 8 (Houston et al. 1993). Thus, like the Xkuy palanquin, which was captured more than 20 years before it was displayed at the ruler's death at Quiri gua, a palanquin commemorating an early date in the Tikal king's reign was interred with the ruler's body many years later. THE REIGN OF SKY XUL, A.D. 785-CA. 790: TWO WAR CAMPAIGNS The successor of Buts' Tiliw, referred to by researchers as Sky Xul, took the throne of Quirigua on 9.17.14.16.18 9 Etznab 1 Kankin (October 15, 7 85).32 Like Buts' Tiliw, the new ruler erected spectacular monuments with lengthy hieroglyphic texts, which con sistently cite Buts' Tiliw's great political and military achieve ments in order to amplify the significance of his own actions (Looper 1995a:188-192). In fact, evidence from two extraordi nary texts commissioned by Sky Xul reveal that the new king sought to emulate the old king in deed, as well, by conducting wars against small sites. The text of Altar O', a monument commissioned to celebrate the 9.18.0.0.0 period ending, exemplifies Sky Xul's po 29 The woman in question (previously identified by Berlin (1968:20) as a woman from Tikal is the object of the verb lok 'oy, "forced out" (Scheie and Grube 1994:21-22, 148). She is named both "companion," and "wife." The agent of this expulsion is named as the Naranjo king known as "Smok ing Squirrel." Houston (1993a: 108) noted that on another occasion Naranjo forces captured a personage from Tikal, indicating that the two sites were engaged directly, as well. 30 In the text of Zoomorph P (Cartouches 5-4), the To' ahaw title re fers to lords who also bear the Copan Emblem Glyph and other toponymic titles, such as chan makom, that are specific to Copan. Thus, the appear ance of the To' ahaw title in conjunction with the Xkuy ahaw may be taken as additional evidence that Xkuy was within the Copan hegemony. 31 Coggins (1975) reported that the body interred in Tikal Burial 24 was also laid on a wooden litter. 32 This king's name may actually read Kuch Na or Na Kuch, because the xib head substitutes for other known na syllables, and McLeod has suggested that the upraised arms are a logograph for kuch, "carry." The "sky" element is actually part of the "sky penis" title, and does not go with the name proper. He was first identified by Kelley (1962) as "Ruler II" and nicknamed "Sky Xul" by Sharer (1978).</page><page sequence="13">Political history of Quirigua 275 puli burned Figure 18. Cylindrical fragment from Copan [drawing by Linda Scheie]. litical rhetoric.33 At X2-Z1 appears the record of the taking of the Xkuy palanquin on 9.16.11.13.1 11 Imix 19 Muan; the agent re sponsible for the act, Buts' Tiliw, is named in the following blocks, as discussed above (see Figure 15B). This event serves as the back ground for Sky Xul's own capture of a palanquin from Xkuy shortly after 9.17.16.0.0 (November 1, 786).34 The record of this victory begins at F'2 (Figure 20), with a calendar round reading 12 ?? 2 Muan, followed by chukah (T515:25.181), "is captured," and three eroded noncalendrical signs that perhaps name the person or ob ject captured. Coupled to this capture event is uch'amwa, "he re ceives," followed by a possessed "sun jaguar" compound, the T733 palanquin glyph, and Xkuy ahaw. After this appear several highly eroded signs, followed by Sky Xul's name and titles. As in the case of the name glyphs of Buts' Tiliw that appear earlier in the text, those of Sky Xul were written using a large format that fills the entire block. In this way, Sky Xul further emphasized the com parison between his own military success and that of his illustri ous predecessor. Elsewhere in the text of Altar O', and also in that of Altar P', dedicated on 9.18.5.0.0, is information suggesting that Sky Xul may have launched assaults against yet another site prior to the attack against Xkuy. Both monuments feature accounts of events that took place on 13Etznab 16 Zip, corresponding to 9.17.15.6.18 (March 24, 786; Figure 21; Looper 1995b). In both texts, the verb associated with this date is written with a sign that may include a T340 ts'a syllable. On Altar P' (see Figure 21B), the verb appears to include a T4 na postfix, implying that the verbal root may read ts'an. In Yucatec, this root has meanings of "fall, ruin, sink, col lapse" (Barrera Vásquez 1980:877). The recipient of this action in both cases is a person named with a combination of moon sign, T16 yax, and what is probably T515b chu, followed by a title com posed of a bat head fused with a hand and superfixed by T168 ahaw, "lord."35 The incorporation of the bat sign in this top 33 The most important published analyses of Altar O' and the adjacent Altar P' include Morley (1937-1938), Thompson (1945), and Jones (1983b). 34 This calendar round is connected by a distance number to an anchor date written as 4 Muluc. This anchor date must correspond to the 4 Muluc 7 Zip (9.17.15.6.9) which appears previously in the text, at Tl. The 4 Mu luc 7 Zip date at Tl is itself tied to the 9.17.15.0.0 period-ending expres sion appearing at Rlb-R2; in addition, it is the first non-period-ending date in the text, following the initial series. The distance number connect ing the 12 ?? 2 Muan date to the anchor date is 12.7, which does not in fact lead to a 2 Muan. The nearest 2 Muan date is 9.17.16.0.4 5 Kan 2 Muan, a solution that does not match the tzolkin coefficient of 12. The closest match for the 12 ?? tzolkin is 9.17.16.0.11 12 Chuen 9 Muan. In sum, I believe that the calendar round written at F'2 contains an erroneous coefficient and that the proper date is one of these two possiblities.

On Altar O', the text clearly states that the action took place yichnal, "in the company of," Sky Xul. The suggestion that the event on 9.17.15.6.18 has martial sig nificance is supported by additional data from Altar O'. Associ ated with a date that is likely two days after the 9.17.15.6.18 event in question, the text records the death of an entity named yik'in at puk'ul (T575[544]:l 16-T743:103-T854-T1016:24) and what may be the termination of a palanquin (Figure 22).36 The calendar round on which the event occurred appears next, followed by ukahi ch 'ahom, "the doing of the censer," which implies the agency of Sky Xul. The k'ul, "god," glyph that terminates the name of the entity that died on this day suggests that, upon the ending of the palanquin, Sky Xul had the god image that had been carried upon it ritually killed, probably through defacement or destruction. The proximity of this action and the 9.17.15.6.18 event suggests that they were linked and that the Yik'in At Pu god image was likely captured from the "bat-hand" site. THE REIGN OF JADE SKY, CA. a.d. 800-810: RECONCILIATION In dramatic contrast to the warlike propaganda fostered by Buts' Tiliw and Sky Xul, the political rhetoric of the sixteenth ruler in the Quirigua dynasty, known as Jade Sky, ranges from ambivalent to conciliatory with rival Copan.37 Conforming to long-standing tradition at Quirigua, Jade Sky's first monument was dedicated five tuns after the previous monument pair of Zoomorph P and Altar P', on 9.18.10.0.0 10 Ahau 8 Zac (August 19, 800). On the south text of the monument, set forth as a background event for the new king's own period ending, appears a record of the 9.15.5.0.0 (July 26, 736) stone erection by Buts' Tiliw, here recorded as taking place in association with a lord from Calakmul (see Figure 13). Discussed above in the context of Buts' Tiliw's break from the Copan hegemony, the presence of this information in Jade Sky's monument is problematic. Considering that, by 9.18.10.0.0, the dynasty of Calakmul was no longer a potent force and its elabo rate alliance network a thing of the past, Jade Sky's inclusion of this patronage could not have been intended to associate his dy nasty with a powerful foreign entity. Rather, it may have been the new king's strategy to cite the Calakmul connection in order to distance the Quirigua dynasty itself from the rupture with Copan in a.d. 738. Certainly, Jade Sky made no attempt to obfuscate the impact of the Calakmul interaction, as the text following the ac count of the 9.15.5.0.0 period ending records the capture or de facement of the images of the Copan gods that occurred six days prior to the sacrifice of the thirteenth Copan king (see Figure 10). On the other hand, it is also noteworthy that Jade Sky did not men tion the personal injury to the unfortunate 18 Rabbit, as did his predecessor, Buts' Tiliw. Jade Sky's text may comprise an attempt to mend relations with the ailing dynasty of Copan through a pre sentation of the rupture with Copan as a thing of the past, engi 36 The date on which this event occurred is actually 2 Ahau 18 Zip (9.17.15.7.0), and that the haab position is [intentionally?] confused with the 19 Muan of the famous 11 Imix 19 Muan date (cf. Looper 1995b). The termination of the palanquin is registered with the "flat-hand" verb, k'a, which should probably be related to Cholti and Chorti entries meaning "finish": k'a (Wisdom 1949:612); capez [k'a?pes] (Morán 1695:77). 37 Jade Sky, originally identified as "Ruler V" by Kelley (1962), re ceived his current nickname from Sharer (1978). Grube et al. (1991) con flated this figure with Kelley's (1962) "Ruler IV" (Sharer's [1978] "Scroll Sky") based on the apparent substitution between the T607a ho main sign of the ruler's name on Stela I and the anthropomorphic head that composes the main sign of the ruler's name on Stela K and the Structure 1B-1 step.</page><page sequence="15">Political history of Quirigua 27' u k*a-? his "palanquin" on 2 Ahaw 19 Muan u kahi ch'ahora ended? doing of the censer Figure 22. Sky Xul's actions on "2 Ahau 19 Muan," Quirigua Altar O', l'3bl-l'4 (drawing by the author). neered by a now-defunct foreign power. This interpretation is consistent with the rhetoric of the next monument of Jade Sky, Stela K. Dedicated on 9.18.15.0.0 (July 24, 805), this monument contains no reference to Buts' Tiliw whatsoever. Instead, Stela K merely records the period-ending rites of the king. As Jade Sky's strategy seems to have been to avoid extended reference to Buts' Tiliw, it contrasts sharply with the agenda of Sky Xul. Yet, there are parallels in Maya history for his treatment, as well. At Caracol, for example, we find a king who recorded th external political ties of his predecessor. In what would appear t be a sequence of events analogous to Quirigua's history, Caracol' Yahaw Te' K'inich took the throne under the authority of Tikal but then turned against his overlord and defeated Tikal, in associ ation with Calakmul (Houston 1991:41; Martin and Grube 1994^ These events were not recorded by Yahaw Te' K'inich, himsell Rather, his second son, Tumol K'inich ("K'an II") recalled thi history on later monuments, such as Altar 21 (Houston 1991). It i interesting to note that, at the inception of the interaction of Calak mul with both Quirigua and Caracol, the local king did not himsel acknowledge the foreign connection. It is possible that, in the earl stages of these interactions, Calakmul's approach was subtle, peí haps offering little more than military aid. In such cases, as durin; the reign of Buts' Tiliw, it seems not to have been advantageous t admit dependency on a foreign power. By the time of the reign o Tumol K'inich of Caracol, in contrast, Calakmul's grip on Caracc seems to have been tighter, as evidenced by various contemporar references (e.g., Stelae 3 and 22) to the authority of Calakmul lord over Tumol K'inich. The retrospective references to ancestral po litical relationships in these texts presented Caracol as the long time ally of Calakmul, a message seemingly appropriate withi the context of intense political interaction between the two sites The final monumental texts of Jade Sky, which adorned his ai chitectural centerpiece of the acropolis, Structure 1B-1, strongl support the hypothesis of better relations between Quirigua an Copan during the reign of Jade Sky.

In all fairness, it should be noted that, from the point of view of Yax Pas, such a visit may have had imperial connotations due to the precedent established by Smoke Imix God K and his 9.11.0.0.0 visit to Quirigua recorded on Altar L. Unfortunately, such speculations can not be confirmed, as Yax Pas's reign ended shortly after the visit, and no account of this diplomatic mission survives from Copan. CONCLUSIONS The above review of Quirigua texts, in light of several recent de cipherments, yields a political history considerably richer than that previously suggested for the site. In place of a kingdom that achieved independence through an isolated violent encounter be tween a charismatic young ruler and his aging overlord, a picture emerges of a rebellion achieved through complex political mach inations and reinforced by prolonged military campaigns. The doc umentation of Buts' Tiliw's courtship of Calakmul for sponsorship of his rebellion provides the first evidence for the inclusion of the southeastern Maya region within the power struggles of the Peten superpowers, as outlined by Martin and Grube (1994). This infor mation supports the notion of the Tikal-Calakmul conflict of the Late Classic period as far-reaching, indeed, and the military threat of Calakmul strong enough to discourage reprisals by a state even as distant from the central lowlands as Copan. Such a reconstruc tion underlines the importance of coercive force in maintaining power and dominance within the Classic Maya world. This, along with the evidence of multiple military encounters between Quiri gua and other small sites, diminishes the vision of the southeast as a relatively peaceful region. Although it is clear that Buts' Tiliw's monumental programs do not deny the importance of violence and warfare in the definition of political power at Quirigua, their emphasis on his personal dom ination over the Copan king within the mythic context of decapi tation sacrifice reveals a basis of power within the realm of the king's supernatural persona. Even the wars documented by this king and his successor, Sky Xul, are most frequently cast in terms of the possession of deity images that had been taken as war tro phies. The historical constructs promulgated by these two kings give no concessions to power structures superior to the city-state, which, given the relatively isolated nature of Quirigua, would prob ably have served only to diminish the aura of power commanded by the king. From this point of view, politics precipitated directly from royal action. By contrast, Jade Sky's monuments experiment with diverse rhetorical strategies, ranging from ambivalent records of previous alliances, to documents of purely ritual actions, to state ments of renewed solidarity with Copan. This variation of strat egies suggests not only that the formulas of previous kings no longer suited the needs of this last known king of Quirigua, but also that the unstable times of the Terminal Classic warranted experimen tation in the search for power through written history. Prior to aban doning carved public texts as a narrative medium, the inscriptions of Jade Sky are a poignant reminder of the nature of written his tory as a major tool for the cultivation of political power, for the ancient Maya as well as other complex civilizations. RESUMEN Este artículo suma la historia de la ciudad Maya de Quirigua, Izabal, Gua temala, en el período clásico tardío, dando énfasis a sus relaciones con otros centros. Los orígenes del reino de Quirigua se documentan desde 426 a.C., cuando los gobernantes de la vecina Copan fundaron el sitio como una colonia. Durante los próximos tres siglos. Quirigua medió las rela ciones estrechas entre Copan y Tikal. En 736 a.C., un personaje del estado rival de Tikal, Calakmul, funcionó con el rey actual de Quirigua, Buts' Tiliw, poco antes de su rebelión contra Copan, en 738 a.C. Esta evidencia sugiere que la rebelión de Quirigua pudo haber sido instigada parcial mente por fuerzas externas. Esta rebelión instigó una serie de ataques por Buts' Tiliw y su sucesor, Sky Xul, contra dos sitios desconocidos. Uno de estos sitios, por lo menos, probablemente estaba incluido en la hegemonía de Copan. En contraste a los reinados de Buts' Tiliw y Sky Xul, el del último gobernante conocido de Quirigua, Jade Sky, parece a haber sido libre de la guerra. En realidad, su último texto indica su reconciliación con Copan. Esta interpretación de los textos de Quirigua sugiere que cambios en alianzas y guerras tuvieron un parte importante en el desarrollo del sitio durante el período clásico tardío.
