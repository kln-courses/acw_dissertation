<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXHIBITION REVIEWS Lynn Chadwick London by JAMES BEECHEY Lynn chadwick died in April this year, aged eighty-eight. The exhibition of thirty four of his sculptures in the Duveen Gal leries at T?te Britain, London (to 21st March), curated by Dennis Farr, had been planned well before his death, but has since inevitably come to be seen as a memorial tribute. Surprisingly, it is Chadwick's first museum retrospective in London and, after the rather disjointed survey at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park in 1991,1 only his second in Britain. Like many of the British sculptors who first came to international prominence at the 1952 Venice Biennale, and who went on to enjoy meteoric success through that decade, Chadwick thereafter sunk into a prolonged period of critical neglect. Some, such as Robert Adams, Bernard Meadows, Geoffrey Clarke and (most strikingly) Reg Buder, virtually disappeared from public view; others, including Kenneth Armitage and Chadwick liimself, while ignored at home, continued to sell steadily abroad, to both private collectors and museums. Prac tical necessities have restricted the selection at T?te Britain almost exclusively to works either in the gallery's collection or belong ing to the artist's estate, although several major pieces in foreign museums ? includ ing The inner eye (1956; Museum of Modern Art, New York) and The watchers (i960; Ludwig Museum, Cologne) ? are repre sented either by maquettes or by similar versions of the same subject. The inclusion of a number of maquettes, in fact, lends a pleasing variety of scale to the display, while also reinforcing the impression that Chad wick's smaller works are invariably more interesting than the monumental sculpture for which he is now known. Confusingly, the exhibition ? if entered, as most visitors do, from Millbank, via the rotunda - proceeds backwards through the classical sequence of the Duveen Galleries, opening with the figurative groups of the 1980s and 1990s and culminating in the seven-and-a-half foot high mobile Fisheater of 1951, dramatically silhouetted against the end wall of the north gallery (Fig. 51). Despite this topsy-turvy chronology, the focus of the show, and of Farr's short accompanying monograph,2 is fixed firmly on the works of the 1950s. A subsidiary exhibition at Beaux Arts (closed 15th November) gave greater prominence to the later work, and particularly to the Elektra series of the 1960s and 1970s.3 Chadwick came late to sculpture, but achieved early and spectacular renown, winning the International Sculpture Prize at the 1956 Venice Biennale at the age of forty-one, after only six years as a profes sional sculptor and against competition from Giacometti, Richier and C?sar. Hav ing trained as an architect and designer (of THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE CXLV DECEMBER 2003 87I</page><page sequence="2">EXHIBITION REVIEWS 51. Fisheater, by Lynn Chadwick. 1951.

Few of these now survive, but their sinuous ele gance is replicated in the maquette for Sta bile (cypress), the space-frame construction commissioned for the Regatta Restaurant at the Festival of Britain, which bore more than a passing resemblance to its neighbour on the South Bank, Powell and Moya's iconic Skylon. There is an airy fragility to Chadwick's mobiles and stabiles, appropri ate to the delicate subject-matter of the Fisheater and the ceiling-suspended Dragon 52.

In Dragonfly this derives as much from the predatory prowling of its slow rotation as from its r?barbative form. The complex construction of these mobiles is testament to Chadwick's remark able engineering skills. Indeed, much of the strength of his early sculpture derives from his ingenious use of new techniques and materials. From the start, he was always a constructor rather than a modeller, his elab orate armatures of linked tetrahedrons serv ing not so much as a practical support but effectively constituting the sculpture itself. Beginning with Idiomorphic beast (1953), Chadwick began to fill in the intersterces of these webs with Stolit, an artificial compound of powdered gypsum and iron filings, which on drying can be rubbed, scored, patinated or left to weather. Allowed to disintegrate, it takes on an almost skeletal look. In Conjunction (1953; Bristol City Art Gallery) the artfully tex tured finish of the off-white surface, through which, as it corrodes, the iron rods are re-exposed, suggests the bones of an emaciated body poking through pallid skin. The imagery of Chadwick's early sculp ture has a distinct affinity with Neo-roman tic art of the period - in the fusion of organic fecundity and gnarled desiccation in The seasons (1955), for instance - and partic ularly with the anthropomorphic insect and thorn subjects favoured by Graham Suther land. The parallel with Sutherland is even more pronounced in Chadwick's develop ment of a more static sculpture, its emphat ic frontality recalling Sutherland's contem poraneous series of paintings of Standing forms. There are allusions, too, in the titles of these brooding, totemic figures (The strangers, The watchers etc.) to the existential ism of Camus and Sartre, although Chad wick always denied any specific literary influences. The symbolism of these ab stracted forms is unmistakeable, however, and they retain a powerful emotional charge. The unnerving imagery of Inner eye (maquette III) (Fig. 5 2), with its glass eye gripped in the claw of a suspended pincer, is heightened by the contrast between solid and translucent materials; the solitary lozenge enmeshed within a hostile palisade in Chadwick's entry for the 'Unknown Political Prisoner' competition is a potent emblem of the alienation of the individual in a totalitarian world; and Beast VII (Fig-53)? in its suggestion of a baying dog, with its hackles raised, is a forceful sculptural metaphor for alternating states of animality: threat, aggression, alarm and fear. When the British Council presented work by a group of eight young British sculptors, including Chadwick, in the British Pavilion at Venice in 1952, Herbert Read famously coined the phrase 'the geometry of fear' to describe the workings of their collective unconscious. In retrospect, Read's shibbo leth has appeared to trap the very individu al sensibilities of this group in a stylistic straitjacket from which they struggled to break free. Nevertheless, his classification of their 'iconography of despair' - 'images of flight, of ragged claws ... of excoriated flesh, frustrated sex' - is certainly valid for much of Chadwick's subject-matter at this time. But if there is an undeniable animalis tic violence and sexual tension underlying his series of dancing figures, there is also an overlooked sly humour in pieces such as Teddy boy and girl II (Fig. 54), with its evoca tion of the frenetic jiving and flamboyant Edwardian dress popularised by working class youth of the 1950s ? an optimistic anti dote to the otherwise prevailing sense of foreboding. With the advent of a new wave of abstract sculpture at the beginning of the 1960s, those artists who in the previous decade had established British sculpture as the most flourishing school in the world seem to have suffered a collective crisis of confidence. Figurative expressionism had become an outworn clich?, extreme angst a melodramatic mannerism. Of the 'geo metry of fear' sculptors only William Turnbull, who abandoned modelling for rudimentary handling, and Eduardo Paol ozzi, with his exploration of the assemblage tradition, convincingly made the transition to the new language of abstraction. In the early 1960s Chadwick himself created a number of semi-figurative objects welded together from scraps of old farm machinery ? these are among his most inventive works and it is a pity that no example is included in the T?te display ? but this was a short lived experiment. Equally brief, and unde veloped, was his response to Minimalism: a series of severely geometrical shapes, often boldly multi-coloured, including his enor mous steel structure Two winged figures, created for the 1962 Festival dei Due Mondi at Spoleto, which Farr plausibly suggests 872 DECEMBER 2OO3 CXLV THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE</page><page sequence="3">53- Beast VII, by Lynn Chadwick. 1956.

Eventually, however, like both Armitage and Buder (in quite different ways), Chadwick drifted further towards figuration. Vestigial traces of abstraction remain, in the codified polyg onal shapes (rectangles or squares for the male, triangles or diamonds for the female) that replace the spikes as ciphers for the human head, but the emphasis now is on refined, naturalistic modelling rather than a subde ambiguity of form. Where Chad wick's earlier work had been enlivened by its pitted, encrusted facture, this is smoothed away in favour of highly polished bronze contrasts, losing much of its textural appeal in the process. Meanwhile his for mulae for creating psychological tension between figures appear increasingly hack neyed and contrived, and his attempts to simulate movement, in the tousled, wind 54.

At the height of his fame in the 1950s, Chadwick was routinely heralded as Henry Moore's heir apparent. His seated bronze figures, a prolific sequence begun in the 1960s and continued through to the 1990s, may indeed be seen as a deliberate rework ing of, and rejoinder to, Moore's own enduring King and queen series. Like Moore, Chadwick continued to bask in widespread approbation abroad - he is represented in museums from Australia to Finland - and he was much in demand as an open-air sculptor. But as his work grew progressive ly more monumental (much of it now intended for the sculpture park he created in the grounds of Lypiatt Park, the 'Straw berry Hill Gothic' house in Gloucestershire where he lived and worked for over four decades), so a debilitating complacency set in. With the exception of the late, fero ciously bestial figures cut out of stainless steel ? two of which are installed in the Tate's sculpture garden, adjacent to the Clore Gallery ? Chadwick failed to develop a new language responsive to changing aesthetic requirements. Fortunately for his reputation, the T?te display does not linger long over the increasingly repetitive output of the last three decades. In a 1954 radio broadcast Chadwick explained his feelings about art and patron age: 'Art must be the manifestation of some vital force coming from the dark, caught by the imagination and translated by the artist's ability and skill.... When we philosophize upon this force we lose sight of it. The intellect alone is still too clumsy to grasp it.'4 While that often elusive vital force ener gises many of his sculptures of the 1950s, these have nonetheless often seemed frozen in the political and social attitudes and anxieties of the immediate post-War world. But as the excellendy presented display of EXHIBITION REVIEWS the early works at T?te Britain demon strates, when Chadwick's imagination is at its most alert, they do indeed assume a time lessness and significance that resonated beyond the particular mood ofthat era. 1 Reviewed by Penelope Curtis in this Magazine 134 (January 1992), pp.45-46. 2 Lynn Chadwick.
