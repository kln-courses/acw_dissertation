Pp. 489: Text; 662 Plates. Indian philosophies are essentially philosophies of values. Speculations concerning the nature of reality may be abundant, the subtle contributions to logical and mathematical method are not absent in Hindu thought; and epistemology, without benefit of brass instruments in psychological laboratories, has produced a surprising variety of systems. But all these are regarded as revealers of value. At the East-West Philosophers Con- ference in Hawaii in 1949, I recall Dr. D. M. Datta of Patna, India, con- clude a scholarly review of Indian epistemologies with great emphasis</page><page sequence="2">270 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH on Indian philosophies as means "to better life.... and realizing in life the truths obtained in philosophy." Because historically in India both philosophy and mythology have reflected a feudal, complex, and often rigidly controlled world of social distinctions, both metaphysics and reli- gion were often put to the service of the apprehension of values difficult for modern Western thought to understand. I suggest this magnificent book as the most palatable antidote to historical distance. Few techniques reveal values so subtly and directly as art, and no arts are so perceptibly enduring as the visual arts of sculpture, painting, and architecture. Here they celebrate a mythological pantheon projecting official and popular philosophies down through the ages. Thus the book presents a human panorama of India Asia and neighboring areas which is magnificently rich in human values. Anyone expecting stereotypes of Indian other-worldliness will be surprised by this world vibrant with anthropomorphic activity in which the human figure, male and female, dominates gracefully. In historically later styles, periods of formalism are periodically imposed on the arts as they were in real life. Soon again the densely crowded life of humanity emerges with the exaltation of thinly disguised themes representing human destiny. Whether these are Upani- shadic "truths" or the earlier Vedic frank religion of nature, the artists do not merely edify the mind with popular myths, or exalt the spirit with surpassing beauty, but they intend to fix attention on what are con- strued, in one system or another, to be the highest values. These two Zimmer volumes follow by nine years his Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization also edited for the Bollingen Series by Joseph Campbell. Both the editor, who completed Zimmer's work and the Foun- dation which issued it posthumously are to be congratulated for seeing through a scholarly project to such a magnificent conclusion. Photographs for Life Magazine by Eliot Elisofon and Dimitri Kessel, and by others, cannot be matched anywhere. In 1947, in reviewing the earlier volume for Western Folklore, this reviewer pointed out that the relations of Hindu religion and Indian nationalism in its first inception had been noted by the anthropologist, Kroeber, several years before in his text, Anthropology. Now that India's role in the world scene is again emerging, one may repeat that awareness of Indian philosophic themes is still long overdue in the Western world. Elements like Brahma, Vishnu's several incarnations, or Dharma, the moral order of the universe in an interplay of opposites, do not constitute ready-made philosophies for the West, and are even now undergoing modifications in India as well, as religious and philosophical "principles." It is pleasant to know that these historic transformations may be studied back in time as they are reflected in the art of Indian Asia.

The problem is to understand better this vast and important part of the world. Its various movements in art and thought have left ug this permanent record. Behind the art and thought lie significant social movements and historical tendencies. A social, artistic and philosophical tradition as rich as this one will continue to be significant. MARVIN K.
