<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ELDER PLINY ON PHILOSOPHERS 1 MIRIAM GRIFFIN Our Pliny clearly had a weakness for geese, as well he might. After all, their sterling service at the time of the Gallic sack had demonstrated that they too lived by the motto vita vigilia est . Speaking of these birds in Book 10.5 1 , he pays tribute to their defence of the Capitol 'when our fortunes were being betrayed by the silence of the dogs'. He then goes on to speak of their capacity for affection and their appreciation of wisdom (, sapientia ), which he illustrates by the story of the philosopher Lacydes. There is a story', he says, 'that a goose attached itself permanently as a companion to the philosopher Lacydes, never leaving his side in public or at the baths, by night or day.' Pliny goes on to make an ironic comparison with our countrymen (nostri), who, he says, are wiser (. sapientiores ), in that they appreciate the goose, not for its intellect, but for the excellence of its liver.1 This text can serve as the basis of the discussion that follows, because it illustrates many of the points that will emerge about the Elder Pliny and the philosophers. Language First, language. Pliny here uses the term philosophus to describe Lacydes. The Greek loan words philosophus and philosophia had been avoided by Cicero in his speeches but used in his philosophical works, where he makes a plea for indulgence, just as it had been made by his Greek predecessors, on the grounds that technical terms are necessary in discussing philosophy.2 Pliny, similarly aware of the technical nature of his subject matter, warns us in the Preface to his Natural History that it will require him to use 'rustic terms or foreign, indeed i As a friend and colleague for over thirty years, I welcome the opportunity to offer this small tribute to Barbara Levick, who, as indefatigable teacher and scholar, has been an exemplum to the young and not so young. l HN. 10.51-52: Est et anseri vigil cura Capitolio testata defenso, per id tempus canum silentio proditis rebus, quam ob causam cibaria anserum censores in primis locant.... potest et sapientiae videri intellectus his esse: ita comes perpetuo adhaesisse Lacydi philosopho dicitur, nusquam ab eo, non in publico non in balineis, non noctu non interdiu digressus. Nostri sapientiores qui eos iecoris bonitate novere. The goose also keeps a careful watch, as is attested by its defence of the Capitol during the time when our interests were being betrayed by the silence of dogs, for which reason food for the geese is one of the first contracts let by the censors .... These birds can also be seen to possess an understanding of wisdom: thus there is a story that a goose attached itself permanently as a companion to the philosopher Lacydes, never leaving his side in public or at the baths, by night or by day. Our countrymen are wiser: they know the goose by the excellence of its liver.' 2 Cic. Fin. 3.3-4; Acad. 1.24-25; D. Sedley, 'Epicurus On Nature , book XVIII', Cronache Ercolanesi 3 (1973) 5-83 (21). 85</page><page sequence="2">86 VITA VIGILIA EST barbarous ones'.3 In fact, the abstract noun philosophia occurs on only two occasions, while the term philosophus , unmodified, is used by Pliny only of Greek 'professional' philosophers (HN7.Ì 13) like Aristotle (HN1. 109; 35.162), Zeno (34.92), Metrodorus (35.135), Pythagoras (19.94), our Lacydes, head of the Academy (10.51), Coeranus (1, list for Bk.2), known from Tacitus (Ann. 14.59), and Chrysippus (fflV30.103), who is called philosophus to distinguish this famous Stoic from a medical writer much used by Pliny.4 When we note that Pliny's highly literary nephew similarly eschews philosophia (only in Ep. 1.10.8 in the mouth of the philosopher Euphrates), and uses philosophus only for Greek professional philosophers, we are tempted to think that the Elder Pliny too, like Cicero and his own nephew, was not without literary self-consciousness - despite his opening disclaimer about writing a work without literary skill or ornament (praef. 12-13) for the unsophisticated (praef. 6).5 More interesting is the fact that our Pliny, despite his restricted use of these Greek terms, makes a point of extending their use beyond their usual boundaries: thus Aesop is called fabellarum philosophus (36.82), and Gymnosophists are called the philosophi of the Indians.6 More strikingly, his two uses of philosophia do not relate to the kind of philosophy most familiar at Rome in his day. The term is first used of Pythagorean doctrine found in the supposed books of Numa, though Pliny is here reporting what the annalists said, and the word may just reflect their usage ( HN 13.86-7). On the second occasion, it refers to the doctrines of the Egyptians regarding natural science, doctrines that had been engraved on two obelisks before they were brought to Rome (36.71). Pliny's preferred term for philosophy is sapientia , the word Cicero used in speeches and the word still preferred by Pliny's nephew (Ep. 1.22.6; 1.10.8).7 Thus, in the Natural History , sapientiae secta (30.3) is a philosophical school; auctores sapientiae (7.80) leaders of philosophical schools; sapientiae adsectatores students of philosophy (18.274). Sapientia is a word with good connotations. Pliny uses it to indicate wits or intelligence or mind generally 3 HN praef . 13: rusticis vocabulis aut externis, immo barbaris. 4 A Chrysippus is listed in Book 1 among Pliny's authorities called medici for books 20-27 and 29-30, and he is clearly the expert cited as Chrysippus medicus at 20.17 and 20.78 (and presumably the medical teacher of 29.5, though his garrulity might suggest confusion with the philosopher). Only in the lists of medical authorities for Books 29-30 do we encounter Chrysippus philosophus , though Detlefsen rejected philosophus for 29 and 30, Mayhoff retained it only for Book 30, and Beaujeu in the Budé edition keeps philosophus in the indices to both books. Mayhoff was presumably thinking of 30.103 where Chrysippus is cited in the text as Chrysippus philosophus. The last was regarded by Detlefsen in his index as Pliny's sole reference to the Stoic philosopher; Ernout in the Budé thought he was the medical writer. In this respect, Detlefsen' s view appears the most plausible. 5 On the younger Pliny's use of the Greek and Latin terms for philosophy and philosophers, see M. Griffin, "The Younger Pliny's debt to moral philosophy', Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 103 (2007) 451-81, Appendix on terminology (416-19). 6 HN 1.22: philosophi eorum quo s gymnosophistas vocant. i Neither uncle nor nephew shows much consciousness of the connotations of achievement, rather than striving, which Cicero (Tusc. 5.9, Leg. 1.58) and Seneca (Ep. 89.4-8) assign to sapientia as opposed to philosophia , following the etymology of the Greek cļnĀooocļna. But the sense of achievement may be detectable when used with professio, adsectator, professor, deditum , or when Socrates or Pythagoras or even Androcydes are called clarus sapientia (HN1.19, 25.13, 14.58) or the three philosophers of the famous embassy sapientiae proceres (7.1 12). Compare his nephew's studium sapientiae at Ep. 1 .22.6.</page><page sequence="3">MIRIAM GRIFFIN: THE ELDER PLINY ON PHILOSOPHERS 87 ( HN 23.41; 7. 171), 8 but also expertise of various kinds (18.23, 9.183). As a virtue, Pliny continues to use it in its older Roman sense of practical wisdom.9 In fact, it is Pliny who provides us with the first example of its use, when he quotes the funeral laudatio delivered by his son for L. Caecilius Metellus who died in 221 BC (HN 7.139-41). He is said to have achieved the ten greatest things, and, in enumerating them, his son mentioned the possession of summa sapientia in the same breath as being a supreme orator, an outstanding commander, and the foremost senator.10 He clearly meant by sapientia the wisdom of a statesman,11 the wisdom of men, as Cicero puts it, Concerning themselves with the good of the res publica '12 Even in selecting Socrates as the key Greek example of sapientia , on the authority of the Delphic oracle (HN 7.119, cf. V. Max. 3.4 ext.l), Pliny sets him in parallel with Romans given the cognomina Catus or Corculum, Roman epithets used to denote practical shrewdness (Varro, LL 7.46 pairing catus with acutus ; Festus 6 IM pairs corculum with sollers , acutus) and earned by the eminent jurist Sextus Aelius Catus and the consular statesman P. Cornelius Scipio Nasica Corculum, cos. 155 BC (Cic. Brut. 78-79, Tusc. 1.18).13 What about the term sapiens ? In Pliny the word is not used to mean either 'philosopher' or someone with philosophical knowledge, for he has to say sapientes doctrinae on the one occasion when he uses it to refer to philosophers teaching in a school (21.9), while the 8 At 7.169 morbus est aliquis per sapientiam mori is clearly corrupt. M. Beagon, The Elder Pliny on the human animal: Natural History book 7 (Oxford 2005) 381 adopts Pigeaud's emendation of per septenarium for per sapientiam . 9 His nephew uses it in this sense at Ep. 6.17.3 and Pan. 55.8, 88.6, possibly also of Pomponius Bassus at Ep. 4.23.1, though A.N. Sherwin- White, The Letters of Pliny: an historical and social commentary (Oxford 1966) 302, thinks it there suggests philosophical interests. io H. Flower, Ancestor masks and aristocratic power in Roman culture (Oxford 1995) 139-40 suggests that the list proceeds from early training in war and rhetoric (primarium bellatorem esse , optimum oratorem) to positions of power and achievement (fortissimum imperatorem, auspicio suo maximam rem geri, maximo honore uti) to the high status and recognition thereby earned (summa sapientia esse, summum senatorem haben), ending with clarissimum in civitate esse), giving a kind of cursus honorum of exceptional achievement. il U. Klima, Untersuchungen zu dem Begriff Sapientia (Bonn 1971) 56-58. E. L. Wheeler, 'Sapiens and stratagems: the neglected meaning of a cognomen', Historia 31 (1988) 166-95 thinks the original meaning of sapiens is military trickery and this is what Metellus' son referred to in summa sapientia. There is no reason to deny that practical wisdom can operate in a military context, but the restriction of meaning requires much special pleading and, in particular, leads to difficulties of interpretation of this passage (see n.15, below). 12 Off. 2.46: ad claros et sapientes viros bene consulentes rei publicae , cf. de Orat. 1.8: Consilio ac sapientia qui regere ac gubernare rem publicam possint. 13 Similarly, at HN 34.26, Pliny compares Socrates in wisdom with the Athenian statesman Themistocles. For a discussion of such Roman cognomina , see E. Badian, 'The clever and the wise: two Roman cognomina in context', in Vir bonus discendi peritus , Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies Supplement 51, ed. N. Horsfall (1988) 6-12. He notes that P. Sempronius Sophos, the consul of 304 BC, earned his cognomen , which was retained by his son, for his knowledge of law (Pomp. Dig. 1.2.2.37), and that Cicero says that Sapiens was attached to L. Acilius for the same reason (cf Leg. 2.59) and to the Elder Cato for political wisdom and shrewdness (Amie. 6-7): it is there assigned to C. Laelius for moral virtue and knowledge comparable to Socrates, implying that he was the philosophers' Wise Man.</page><page sequence="4">88 VITA VIGILIA EST sapientes of the Indians are devotees of a sapientia 'bordering on religion',14 clearly Brahmins. In the laudatio , the younger Metellus is quoted as saying that the ten things his father achieved were those which sapientes spend their lives pursuing. The sense is likely to be correlative with the sapientia achieved by Metellus, that is, practical wisdom.15 Pliny himself uses the word sapiens to denote cleverness (2.189, 1 1.221) and expertise of various kinds (28.10): there are 'wise' farmers (18.79), animals (22.1 19) and mulberry trees (16.102). And, in our opening text, the Roman connoisseurs of pâté de foie gras are called sapientiores . Pliny does not go as far as his younger contemporary Quintilian in deliberately opposing and preferring to those called philosophy the Romānus sapiens , a vir civilis vereque sapiens (11.1.35, cf. 12.2.7). But Pliny's usage contrasts sharply with that of his nephew, who uses sapiens of philosophical authorities (Ep. 5.8.5), of Romans educated in philosophy (Ep. 4.15.9, 5.16.8, 4.17.9, 9.13.6, 5.1.13 of Pliny himself), and in its philosophical sense of the Wise Man (Ep. 1.10.4, 3.11.5). It is important to note that the language of the Elder Pliny already hints that he has less interest than his nephew in the adherents and teaching of the standard Greek philosophical schools, and even that philosophers in the ordinary sense occupy a less prominent place on his mental landscape than on that of his nephew. These contrasts, to which we shall return later, will turn out to be quite revealing in explaining why Pliny has the attitudes he has towards philosophers. Attitudes to Philosophers We have already seen that Pliny includes in the same category with the standard school philosophies, not only Pythagoreanism but the beliefs of the Egyptians.16 Pliny's attitudes fit with the primacy he accords to natural philosophy, or what we would call natural science, for it is this area of investigation that holds his broad category of philosophia or sapientia together. Thus Pythagoras is called philosophus à propos of his study of plants ( HN 19.94, cf 25.13); the Egyptian philosophy is about rerum natura (36.71). Pierre Grimal, in fact, has drawn attention to the authority accorded by Pliny to the pre-Socratic physich Anaximander (2.191); Empedocles (29.6); Demetrius (8.59) and Phanias ( 22.35), Thaïes (2.53; 36.82), and Democritus (18.273). It may be that Pliny's hostile attitude to magic, though not identical with the attitude of modern scientists towards astrology, magic spells and some forms of alternative medicine, is to be connected with the primacy he gives to natural philosophy. For he refuses to consider among the sapientiae sectae (30.3) the practitioners of magic, in which he includes astrology, necromancy, human sacrifice, belief in the after life, and, most damning 14 HN 6.66: prope in religionem versae sapientiae deditum. 15 Flower, Ancestor masks (n.10, above) 140-41 thinks the phrase in quibus quaerendis sapientes aetatem exigerent points to Metellus' organization of his father's achievements in the order they occurred in life (see n.10) and that both here and in summa sapientia esse the word sapientia 'contains overtones of prudence and shrewdness rather than of philosophical learning'. This is preferable to the idea of Wheeler, 'Sapiens and stratagems' (n.ll, above) 193, who thinks that sapientes represents a later meaning than that of summa sapientia (which refers to military shrewdness) and does not come from the laudatio but is an interpolation by Pliny's source. Certainly Pliny must have construed the two references in the same sense. 16 The Brahmins and Gymnosophists seem to be named as philosophers because of the veneration they enjoy in their own country (6.66, cf. 12.24; 7.22).</page><page sequence="5">MIRIAM GRIFFIN: THE ELDER PLINY ON PHILOSOPHERS 89 in his view, quack remedies. As Mary Beagon rightly says, his attitude here is partly the standard contemporary one, 'a mixture of xenophobia, of common sense insulted, and of a revulsion from the nasty and unpleasant', partly the consequence of his reverence for nature: the practitioners of such arts, in his view, not only misrepresent and misunderstand nature, but invade and abuse her.17 For Pliny philosophy as a whole belongs itself to a still wider category. Pliny particularly identifies it as one brand of litterae , learning or culture (7. 112, 18.274), and of Greek culture in particular. Thus when he comes to contrast the attitude of the Elder Cato who attempted to ban Greeks from Italy, notably the embassy of three philosophers in 155 BC, with that of his great-grandson who brought to Rome a statue of Zeno and another Stoic philosopher in the flesh, Pliny speaks of hostility and favour to the Greek language (7.113, cf. 34.92). 18 Yet, despite his veneration for the Elder Cato, 'supreme orator, supreme general, supreme senator' (7.100), he does not regard philosophers with the hostility he shows towards some other representatives of Greek culture, notably Greek doctors, regarding whom he shares the negative judgment of his hero (29.13-28, cf. 24.4-6, 26.1 1). He lists a number of philosophers, identified as such, among men of exceptional talent who receive honours they deserve (7. 109, 110, 112-13,1 19-20), and, even when expecting adverse criticism from Stoico s et dialécticos, Epicúreos quoque for his work on grammatica ,19 presumably the Dubii sermonis octo (Plin. Ep. 3.5.5), he confines his criticism of them to the slowness with which they produce their critiques, comparing it to miscarriages and the protracted pregnancy of elephants (praef 28).20 Pliny mentions philosophers belonging to all of the major schools, and regards with particular reverence Socrates (7.1 19-20), Plato (7.1 10) and Aristotle (7.109), who is one of his listed authorities. He also has good things to say of others among his philosophical authorities, namely Chrysippus (30.103 tarn gravis auctor ),21 and Posidonius (7.112). The Roman philosophers of the past attract a lot of notice, particularly the adherents of the native philosophical school of the Sextii, to which Seneca was attached in youth {Ep. 108.17-18), but which he described as extinct in his old age (Nat. 7.32.2). The son of Q. Sextius, Q. Sextius Niger, is in fact the author most cited by Pliny in the indices to the books given in 17 P. Grimal, 'Pline et les philosophes', Helmantica 37 (1986) 239-49; M. Beagon, Roman nature: the thought of Pliny the Elder (Oxford 1992) 21, 106-08. 18 The philosopher he brought back when military tribune (67 BC) is clearly Athenodorus Kordylion (Plut. Cat. Min. 10. 1-3, 16.1). 19 Who the dialectici named here are is disputed: Academics (Loeb) and Peripatetics (Beagon, 'Burning the brambles: rhetoric and ideology in Pliny, Natural History 18 (1-24)', in Ethics and Rhetoric , ed. D. Innés, H. Hine and C. R. B. Pelling (Oxford 1995) 117-32 (128 n.20) have both been suggested, because the fact that they are clearly contemporaries excludes the Megarian philosophers who are the obvious candidates (cf. HNI ASO Diodorus sapientiae dialecticae professor ), but Cicero's description of two Stoics as principes dialecticorum at Acad. 2.143 might suggest that Pliny intends Stoicos et dialécticos to be taken together here. 20 S. Citroni Marchetti, 'Filosofia e ideologia nella 'Naturalis historia' di Plinio', in ANRW II 36.5 (1992) 3248-3306 (3252) exaggerates Pliny's hostility to philosophers, here and elsewhere. 21 On the problem of Chrysippus philosophus being listed as a medical authority in the indices for books 29 and 30, see above n.4.</page><page sequence="6">90 VITA VIGILIA EST Book I,22 and he pays compliments to the elder Sextius (18.274) and his son (32.26), 23 to the Sextian adherent Papirius Fabianus (36.125) and to Seneca (14.5 1),24 who was much influenced by all of them.25 Cornelius Celsus, another adherent of the sect, is a frequently cited authority. Cicero wins an accolade for his De Officiis , which Pliny thinks worth committing to memory (praef. 22), though it is notable that the extended eulogy of Cicero at 7.1 16-17 conspicuously omits his philosophical achievements. Similarly, the elder Sextius and Seneca are particularly praised for the practical application of the-ir expertise to farming, the younger Sextius is admired for medical writings and for his rejection of magical belief (29.76), and Papirius Fabianus for his grasp of natural science. Ás for Seneca's philosophical writing, it is notable that no account is taken of his long work of natural philosophy in the lament that Pliny appends to his own discussion of the winds: now that peace under the empire gives more opportunities for discovery, Pliny writes, there are no new investigations, and not even past discoveries are studied (2.1 16-19). The writer of the Natural Questions receives no credit here. And yet Pliny probably knew the work.26 Pliny singles out for attack the doctrines of the Atomists (2.3), among whom he presumably includes Democritus, a philosopher who generally gets a rather mixed press in Pliny: criticized as a purveyor of magical beliefs (2.14, 7.189, 24.160, 26.19, 27.141), he is praised as a practical agricultural expert (18.273, 341). Epicurus, presumably censured among the Atomists, is also criticized for starting the luxurious fashion of having country villas in cities (19.50-51). Pliny ridicules Epicurus' followers for perpetuating his memory by displaying images of him and celebrating his birthday, in defiance, as Pliny points out, of the central tenet of his philosophy to live in obscurity (35.5). Other philosophers also come in for amused irony, as in the story of the seventy earthenware dishes auctioned by the heirs of Aristotle which, Pliny contends, demonstrates the moral decline of the philosophers of Greece (35. 162). 22 He is listed as an authority for Books 12-16, 20-30 and 32-34. 23 The two Sextii are usually mentioned together as founders of the Roman school of philosophy (Sen. Nat: 7.32.2, Quint. 10.1.124). Pliny names among his authorities only Sextius Niger usually described as qui Graece de medicina scrip sit, but he usually cites him as Sextius (except at 20.226). M. Wellmann, 'Sextius Niger, eine Quellenuntersuchungen zum Dioscorides', Hermes 47 (1889) 530-69 (546-47) established that Pliny's authority was the son. However, the Sextius e Romanis sapientiae adsectatoribus of 18.274 does seem to be the elder Sextius, because he is described as a philosopher, not a medical writer, because the anecdote is not about medicine, and because Sextius Niger is not named as an authority for this book. 24 24. G. Serbat, 'Pline l'Ancien: état present des études sur sa vie, son oeuvre et son influence', in ANRW II, 32.4 (1986) 2071-2200 (2127) notes this as a favourable judgement; Citroni Marchetti, ' Iuvare mortalem : l'ideale programmatico della N.H. di Plinio nei rapporti con il moralismo stoico- diatribico', Atene e Roma 27 (1977) 124-148 (134 n.17), 'Filosofia e ideologia' (n.20, above) 3267-8 as antipathetic. 25 M.

Wallace-Hadrill, 'Pliny the Elder and Man's Unnatural History', Greece and Rome 37 (1990) 80-96 (95) notes the neglect. Papirius Fabianus had also written about winds in one of his works ( HN 2.121), but, though Seneca heard him, his heyday probably belonged around the time of Seneca's birth when Pliny may not have thought of peace as so fully established, given Augustus' wars fought on the borders of the Mediterranean. Citroni Marchetti, 'Filosofia e ideologia' (n.20, above) 3259 notes Pliny's use of the Natural Questions.</page><page sequence="7">MIRIAM GRIFFIN: THE ELDER PLINY ON PHILOSOPHERS 91 There is also the tale of Diodorus the Megarian who died of shame when he could not solve a logical puzzle posed by Stilpo (7.180). And there is of course our anecdote about Lacydes and his doting goose (10.51). It is notable, however, that the irony Pliny here directs at the philosopher is exceeded by that directed at the high-ranking Roman sapientiores , for whom a goose just means goose liver pâté and whose rivalry in culinary achievements Pliny goes on to describe (10.52).27 Pliny 's philosophical stance There is not need here to describe and analyze the philosophical or quasi-philosophical views of the Elder Pliny, since that difficult task has been done very well by Mary Beagon and others.28 There is a consensus that Pliny is not an adherent of any one philosophical doctrine, but that his mental landscape features strong Stoic elements, notably on cosmology, non- anthropomorphic conception of the divine (with HN 2.14, cf. Sen. Nat. 2.45), the existence of divine Providence, and man's centrality in the universe. There is also a clear debt to Epicureanism, notably in the rejection of belief in the after life (HN 7.5), belief in astrology and various forms of divination (2.23-24, 2.28, 11.273), and, at one point, belief in direct providential concern for individuals (2.20): superstitions from which the rational study of nature can free us (2.54). As already mentioned (p. 88), Grimal has stressed his sympathy with the pre-Socratic philosophers, however indirect their influence. Any reader of Pliny, however, is aware that his whole orientation is different from that of the philosophers. Even the style and structure of the Natural History proclaim this. First, let us consider style. Pliny excuses himself, as we saw, for not writing high literature with its customary ornaments (praef 12-13): his work is directed primarily at an uneducated readership and only after them at studious types: 'for the mob of farmers and artisans, and after them for students who have time on their hands'.29 Though he is only half serious here, his primary purpose being to deprecate his audacity in dedicating the work to Titus,30 the Natural History does not in fact exhibit either the elegant and systematic qualities of Cicero's theoretical works or, even in his attacks on luxury, the high protreptic style characteristic of the moral philosophy of his day (Musonius, Seneca, Epictetus).31 As to structure, the exposition of a philosophical doctrine was systematic, subordinating detail to the establishment of certain key truths. Even when philosophers wrote works on one aspect of the philosophical system, there are firm pointers to how the topic relates to the system as a whole. But Pliny's nephew was to describe the Natural History as 'a diffuse and 27 A point made by S. Citroni Marchetti, Plinio il vecchio e la tradizione del moralismo Romano (Pisa 1991) 73; 'Filosofia e ideologia' (n.20, above) 3291. 28 See the works listed in nn.17, 19, 24, 26, 27. 29 HN praef. 6: humili vulgo scripta sunt, agricolarum, opificum turbae, denique studiorum otiosis. 30 The passage quoted in the n. above begins: 'Then (if the work had not been dedicated to Titus) I could have said: 'Why are you reading a work like this, Imperator?' ' (Tum possem dicere: ' Quid ista legis , imperatori '). 31 But Pliny, when recounting the exploits of M. Sergius (HN 7.104-06), his final and supreme exemplum of virtus in the sense of military courage, can approximate to a Senecan sententia: ceteri profecto victores hominum fuere, Sergius vicit etiam fortunám.</page><page sequence="8">92 VITA VIGILIA EST erudite work, not less various than nature itself.32 It is not that the work has no structure: it has a clear macrostructure, which even exhibits symmetry,33 and which reflects a hierarchical conception of nature in which other elements of creation are inferior to man and exist for his benefit.34 But Pliny's eagerness to provide a table of contents shows that he knew it would not be easy to find particular points, partly, but not only, because there are so many of them.35 Given the Roman patriotism of the author, one might even wonder if he has deliberately refused to organize his work in the systematic fashion of a Greek tc^vt] or ars and preferred the rough and ready model of his hero, the Elder Cato, for his work bears more resemblance to Cato's De Agri Cultura than to Varro's De Re Rustica?6 In any case, the underlying difference from philosophical teaching is that Pliny revels in the detail for its own sake, as is shown in his boast about the 20,000 facts and in his characterization of his subject matter as life itself in all its aspects (praef. 17;13-14). Pliny is clearly fascinated by the facts of nature. Particularly memorable is his insistence that, in contemplating nature, nothing is supervacuum or unworthy of attention (1 1.4) because the craftmanship of Nature shows particularly in small things (11.3-4). Indeed it is this fascination with the wonders of nature that provides Pliny with such high stylistic moments as he has. As Gregory Hutchinson writes, 'Scholarly reserve and the heightening of marvels, lowness and exaltation of language and of content, are intriguingly and consciously mingled'.37 But, as has been pointed out, this is very different from the spirit in which Seneca writes about natural phenomena, elsewhere and especially in book 3 of the Natural Questions ,38 Both Pliny and Seneca plead the usefulness to mankind of their enterprise, but Seneca expects the reading about natural phenomena to lift the human mind above more mundane concerns (sordida), particularly those concerning the body (cf. Nat. 1 , praef. 4-8), and to encourage it to use the subtlety appropriate to the exploration of nature's mysteries in dealing with morality (Nat. 3, praef. 18). He regards the teaching of how to overcome vice and become independent of Fortune as the most important type of teaching and compares to 32 Ep. 3.5.6: opus diffusum eruditum, nec minus varium quam ipsa natura. 33 Serbat, 'Pline l'Ancien' (n.24, above) 2107-08. 34 Beagon, Roman nature (n.17, above) 13, 36-37. 35 At praèf 33, he gives his motive as a desire to save Titus time, an indirect consequence being that others will not have to read straight through the work, 'but each reader will only search for the particular point he wants and will know where to find it' (sed ut quisque desiderabit aliquid id tantum quaerat, et sciat quo loco inveniat). 36 For the characteristics of Cato' s work, see E.

Pliny too compares historical writing unfavourably with his own, but his point seems to be that historians aim to acquire popularity by entertaining, when they could concentrate on serving and being useful to others (HN praef. 12; 15-16), and he approves of voyages to acquire know-ledge in contrast to those undertaken for commercial gain (2.1 18). Moreover, what he means by helping other men is not confined to, but clearly includes, practical ways of having enough to eat and keeping healthy (20. 1).39 Again, whereas Seneca insists on the superiority of philo-sophy to practical knowledge and skills which only provide the wherewithal for luxurious living ( Ep . 90.7-8, 24-7, 33-4), Pliny celebrates human technological and artistic achieve-ments, so long as they are not used in the service of avarice and other vices (HN 14.1-7). For him, man is a partner in the creative processes of nature.40 It is possible to exaggerate these contrasts, as Beagon demonstrates.41 Seneca too celebrates the open traffic of the seas, the building of cities, artistic works, healing medicines as gifts from divine Providence to the human race (Ben. 4.28), if not misused (Nat. 5.18.4-16); Seneca too laments the lack of effort men put into acquiring knowledge, so that many discoveries have actually been forgotten (Nat. 7.31.1, 32.1-4, cf. Plin. HN 2.1 17, 14.2-4). The differences are more a matter of different priorities, different degrees of emphasis, rather than stark contradiction. Pliny may rail at luxury in language similar to that of the moralists, but the effect is different, more of an unreflective sentimental attachment to the idealised Roman past.42 Pliny 's non-philosophical attitudes Pliny, however, also avows attitudes that smack of the kind of commonsense which moral philosophy was designed to combat. These relate to the central concerns of all the philosophical schools: the status of material advantages and the management of the passions. We have had occasion to mention the eulogy of L. Metellus by his son. Pliny concurs in regarding the list of blessings - victories, offices, honours - as the stuff of which the successful life is made: he only disputes the claim that Metellus was exceptionally fortunate, because he ultimately lost his sight (7.139-141).43 As for the son, he too is denied rara felicitas because of the disgrace he suffered at the hands of a tribune, including the loss of financial independence (7.142-146). At no point in this account does Pliny express any doubt about the value, positive and negative, of what Fortune bestows. It is true that he is here 39 Beagon, Roman nature (n.17, above) 60-63 on Pliny's wide criterion of usefulness. 40 HN 36.101, cf. Cie. N.D. 2.152: alteram naturam efficere.

However, he speaks in terms of bona and mala (7.132, 134, 151) and offers no other definition of happiness. What he opposes to such claims is the wisdom of the Delphic oracle, conferring the title of fortunate on a man who died fighting for his country and on another who lived a quiet life with little in his life that was bad in the ordinary sense (7.151). Pliny's is the proto-philosophical view of Herodotus and Greek tragedy: only the last day can give the final verdict (7.132). Elsewhere Pliny speaks of exile as a terrible misfortune (7.120) and catalogues the evils of old age as part of his argument that nature offers human beings nothing better than shortness of life (7.167-68). Citroni-Marchetti notes that Pliny accords more value than the moralists, not only to the ordinary natural needs of man, but to the values of Roman society. We think not only of the triumphs of the Metelli, but of the ancestral masks that Pliny praises as inciting others to triumphs: for Seneca the display of these masks demonstrates pride in ancestry, a thing of no value (Ben. 3.28.2, cf. Ep. 44.5, 76. 12).44 The celebration of M. Sergius as the final and supreme exemplum of virtus in the sense of military courage (HN 7. 104-06) might seem to be an exception. As Mary Beagon points out, Pliny is here writing in the manner of a Stoic celebrating the triumph of virtue over fortune, the possibility of happiness without the external goods supplied by chance.45 However, even here Pliny's contempt for the military honours that Sergius did not receive is clearly not complete: not only do the exempla that precede this one have the decorations awarded for valour listed in exact detail, but Pliny is keen to point out that Sergius should have had these honours and would have had them, had his victories come at a different time. Even in the final sententia , 4 All other victors have conquered men, Sergius conquered fortune as well' (c eteri profecto victores hominum fuere, Sergius vicit etiam fortunám), the etiam makes clear that the military victories are not negligible even when compared with the triumph over fortune. Whereas for Seneca, divine providence has more than made up for the lack of natural coverings and weapons that nature provides for animals by giving human beings reason and an instinct for society and mutual help (Ben. 4.18.2-3), for Pliny, nature, like a stepmother, has distinguished him from the animals by his desire to weep for the precariousness and misery of his life (HN 7.2-5). Pliny regards it as part of the benignitas of nature to the animals that they do not concern themselves with glory, money, ambition, or death (2.25, 7.5): there is no suggestion that human beings could make use of reason, with or without philosophy, to acquire such insouciance. Indeed Pliny seems to pity the human animal because he alone feels grief, desire, fear and anger, the passions that the philosophers agree could, and should, be moderated or eliminated (7.5). Though he is not in conflict with Cicero and Seneca in admiring the imperturbability of Socrates, while condemning the moroseness of certain 44 See Citroni Marchetti, 'Iuvare mortalem ' (n.24, above) 133.

In the light of Pliny's attitudes towards external ills and emotional reactions to them, it is not surprising to find that his stance is in some respects different from theirs. It is worth looking at these differences in some detail, because they will draw attention to certain surprising omissions by Pliny and lead us on to considering the illuminating contrasts mentioned earlier with the concerns and opinions of his nephew. Speaking of some particularly disgusting remedies derived from the human animal itself, Pliny states his view that life is not so desirable as to be prolonged by any means. We have to die eventually anyway, and the most consoling thought is that a timely death is the greatest good that nature offers us and that such a death is actually within our power to bestow on ourselves (28.9). Barring the designation of death as a 'good' (again at HN 7.190), any Stoic philosopher could agree with this since, to a Stoic, life itself is only one of the 'preferred indifférents', and there are circumstances when the decision to take one's life is rational and justifiable. Nor would a Stoic philosopher demur at Pliny's notion that death can be a port of refuge (25.24): Seneca himself uses the image (Cons. Marc. 17.4, Cons. Polyb. 9.7). Nor at the idea of incurable and painful disease as a reason for choosing it (HN 20.199, 25.24): a rational reason for choosing suicide is the balance of negative indifférents such as pain over positive ones. As Diogenes Laertius puts it, 'the wise man will make a rational exit from life, either on behalf of his country, or for the sake of his friends, or if he suffers intolerable pain or mutilation or incurable disease' (7.130, cf. Cic. Fin. 3.60-61). A Stoic philosopher would not have much trouble with Pliny's idea that the ability to commit suicide is a divine benefit amidst the punishments of life, though he would find it hard to accept that, in being able to do this, man is better off than God who is (logically) unable to kill himself (HN 2.27). Seneca speaks of suicide as the door to freedom provided by the eternal law of Nature (Ep. 70.14, 24). Again, Pliny's idea that earth providentially provides poisons as an easier way to die than starvation, jumping, hanging, drowning or stabbing (HN 2.156) would be acceptable to a Stoic, for, as Seneca says, for the man who wants to exit life, the best death is the one he prefers (Ep. 70.12, 24). Where Pliny parts company with the Stoics is in regarding weariness of life (taedium vitae ) as an acceptable motive for suicide (HN 2.156, cf. 7.186). Though this is the common phrase used by jurists as a blanket term to characterize the motivation of suicides which are not motivated by consciousness of crime, Epicurus and Seneca both use it of a specific motive for suicide which they condemn, namely, an irrational distaste for life springing ultimately from the fear of death (Sen. Ep. 24.22-26, 78.25). Pliny, by contrast, seems to imagine fear and 46 HN 7.79-80. Cicero makes the same comparison of Socrates with Crassus and Timon in Tusc. 3.31, 4.25; Seneca approves Socrates' consistency of expression and prefers Democritus to Heraclitus, Tranq.

For him physical pain and suffering in themselves suffice for justification, rather than the consequent disability to lead an active life of virtue, as for Seneca ( Ep . 58.36, 60.4, 104. 3). 47 Finally, Pliny hardly mentions any circumstance but physical pain and mental distress (24.163, 7.186 (three cases); 19.110), whereas, for the Stoics, one could justifiably commit suicide for the sake of one's country or friends, or to avoid performing disgraceful actions under duress (Sen. Ben. 1.1 1.4, Ep. 70.6).48 This means that Pliny, as Mary Beagon notes,49 omits all mention of suicides motivated by political principle or of the enforced suicides of political martyrs, both made famous by his heroes Socrates and the younger Cato and well established in the Latin literary tradition, as the extant works of Cornelius Nepos, Seneca, and Tacitus demonstrate. Pliny 's omissions Though Pliny is clearly very interested in the subject of suicide, and though he vigorously denounces Nero as a destroyer of the human race {HN 7.45) and a poison administered to the world (22.92), he never mentions the many suicides of this type under the last regime. We think of the heroic suicides celebrated later by Tacitus, notably Barea Soranus and Thrasea Paetus {Ann. 16.33-35) who had indeed written a biography of the younger Cato. In fact, Pliny does not mention any central members of the so-called Stoic Opposition, senators whose determination to oppose tyranny and the stifling of senatorial freedom was strengthened by their Stoic beliefs. Nor do we hear of any of the professional philosophers associated with them: Musonius Rufus, revered by his nephew, Demetrius the Cynic, celebrated by Seneca, and the unworthy Egnatius Celer who betrayed his patron Barea Soranus (Tac. Hist. 4.10, 4.40; Ann. 16.32). Only the obscure Coeranus, whom Tacitus places in the company of Musonius Rufus and the senator Rubellius Pļautus in 62 {Ann. 14.59), is named as an authority for book 2. Perhaps we should not be surprised by the omission. Though many of Pliny's anecdotes probably spring from his work on his History , he had a great store from which to illustrate points in the Natural History , and the ones he chose may have occurred to him virtually at random. Yet Pliny does mention a fair number of contemporaries, some of them older men who suffered at the hands of Nero, such as Seneca, Antistius Vetus (as an authority for books 3-6), and Domitius Corbulo; and the last two had family connections with Rubellius Pļautus and Barea Soranus.50 More striking is the fact that Pliny's life-long friend (Plin. Ep. 3.5.3), the tragedian Pomponius Secundus whom he mentions in the Natural History (13.83) and whose 47 See Griffin, Seneca (n.25, above) 311 -IS. 48 In the case of the Hyperboreans who seem to die when they are old but not ill {HN 4.89), it is unclear if their satietas vitae springs from their age and inability to be active or just boredom: the first would satisfy the Stoics, but not the second. At HN 7.186 L. Domitius Ahenobarbus is presumably thought of as motivated by the pain of disgrace. 49 Beagon, Roman nature (n.17, above) 239, M.

Some have adduced political reasons for the omissions. Ci troni-Marchetti notes that Vespasian's relations with the Stoic group of senators and philosophers worsened after a brief period of collaboration,52 and Mary Beagon suggests that it would have been tactless of Pliny, c. AD 75 when he was writing the Natural History , to mention Thrasea Paetus, as his son-in- law Helvidius Priscus was executed about that time.53 No one could dispute either of the two premises on which this view is based: that Pliny has what Joyce Reynolds has called 'a courtier's approach',54 and that Stoic philosophers and senators were in hot water when Pliny was composing his great work. As to the first, the Preface alone proclaims Pliny's concern to please Vespasian and Titus. Aside from the compliments that accompany the dedication to Titus and the prediction of Vespasian's well- deserved deification (HN 2.18), there is the ingenious way in which he indicates that he has already written Histories highly favourable to the Flavian dynasty. By saying that he has left the work unpublished in order to avoid being judged a flatterer (praef. 20), he actually enhances the value of the flattering things said there, while preserving his own reputation for independence. Reynolds notes that, just as Pliny rescued the victories won by the Emperor's father from oblivion, when he wrote about the German Wars under Claudius, so during the next reign he may have been following the fashion set by Nero, when he developed the interest in artistic developments that he displays in the Natural History : certainly he visited the atelier of Zenodorus, the maker of the Colossus (34.45), and watched the painter Famulus at work on the frescoes of the Golden House (35.120). That did not stop him later from joining enthusiastically in the denigration of Nero that formed part of Flavian propaganda and celebrating the public munificence demonstrated by removing the Greek works of art looted for the Golden House to the Temple of Peace (34.84, 36.27).55 As for the second premise, it is clear that the conflict between the Princeps and the so-called Stoic Opposition did not end with Nero. It is true that Galba recalled from exile the associates of Nero's victim Thrasea Paetus, senators like Helvidius Priscus and the philosophers Musonius Rufus and Demetrius the Cynic, and that Vespasian, who could be described as a friend of men like Thrasea and Barea Soranus (Tac. Hist. 4.7.2), allowed the prosecution of the disloyal philosopher who had testified against Barea (Hist. 4.10). But it was made clear 51 HN2.221, 3.121, 3.130, 6.218, 14.110, 31.61; Tac. Awn. 16.21. 52 ' Iuvare mortaleirì (n.24, above) 126, Plinio il Vecchio (n.27, above) 18-21; 'Filosofia e ideologia' (n. 20, above) 3253: 'dietro la figura dell'avversario malevolo e sterile si può sempre riconoscere, io credo, quella del filosofo stoico'. 53 Beagon, Roman nature (n.17, above) 239. 54 The Elder Pliny and his times', in Science in the early Roman Empire , ed.

It is symptomatic of the scant regard that Vespasian and his sons had for professional philosophers that a decree of 75, according various privileges to grammarians, rhetors and doctors, makes no mention of philosophers, who were clearly not thought to deserve equal status as teachers useful to society.57 The notion that Pliny avoided mentioning heroic suicides, as well as those philosophers and their senatorial associates who were mal vus by the regime, gains in credibility when we note the prominence of just these themes in the published correspondence of Pliny's nephew. For Pliny's nephew probably had no more formal education in philosophy than his uncle, both having been exposed to it as part of their rhetorical training.58 In fact, it was the uncle who had written a large work on that training (Plin. Ep. 3.5.5), and who had made use of philosophical works that dealt with the natural phenomena.59 Then again, the nephew resembles his uncle in his attachment to ordinary values, accepting the emotion of grief and the importance of fame and good repute: in fact he explicitly, if inaccurately, contrasts his views with those of the philosophers.60 However, by the time the earliest letters in our collection were written, just after the murder of the Emperor Domitian in September of 96 and early in the reign of Nerva, there were good non-philosophical reasons for the younger Pliny to emphasize his acquaintance with philosophers (e.g. Ep. 1.5, 1.10, 2.18, 3.11, 9.13). Those philosophers and senatorial devotees of philosophy who had been exiled from Rome by the tyrant, some three years before, had just been recalled to Rome. When the letters were published under Trajan, the same line would still have been politically correct'. It is Trajan who is credited with saying to Dio Chrysostom, whom he allowed to accompany him in his triumphal chariot, 1 do not understand what you are saying, but I love you as myself (Philos. VA 488), and it was under him, if not under Nerva, that philosophers were at last accorded various privileges and immunities hitherto accorded to other teachers, marking the end of the philosophical persecution that had started with Nero.61 The younger Pliny represents himself as deeply involved with the tight-knit groups of avowed Stoics who had survived the Neronian and Flavian persecutions and who continued 56 See D.C. 66.12; M.

In Letter 3.11.3, Pliny names all seven of the senatorial Domitianic victims of 93, calls them his amici, and says that he himself was in serious danger when they were killed or exiled in 93. Among them were Junius Mauricus ( Ep . 1.5.10), who returned, and Arulenus Rusticus and Herennius Senecio, who had been put to death by Domitian for writing eulogistic biographies of the Neronian victims Thrasea Paetus and Helvidius Priscus (Tac. Ag. 2.1). The other surviving members of the group were women, including Arria and Fannia, wife and daughter of Thrasea Paetus (3.11.3)- 'this tedious pair' as S her win- White calls them.62 Fannia had also been the wife of Helvidius Priscus and the stepmother of the younger Helvidius Priscus who had been martyred under Domitian. Pliny claims to have known from youth, and celebrates at length, two philosophers connected with Musonius Rufus: Euphrates (Ep. 1.10), who was his pupil (Fronto, Ad M. Ant. Imp. I = p. 135.3 van den Hout), and Artemidorus, his son-in-law (Ep. 3.1 1.7). In fact, in the Artemidorus letter, Pliny himself claims himself to have loved and revered Musonius Rufus 'as far as my age permitted' (3.1 1.5). Like his uncle, the younger Pliny records a considerable number of suicides. Some of these are, like those mentioned by his uncle, simply motivated by illness (Ep. 3.7) or mental distress (Ep. 3.9.5: shame). But there are also extended accounts of heroic and high-principled suicides. Pliny devotes a letter to the heroic deeds of the elder Arria, the mother-in-law of Thrasea Paetus, in the course of which he celebrates her long-standing determination to end her life along with her husband and recalls her well known last words, Paete, non dolet , when she set him an example of suicide (Ep. 3.16).63 Pliny also records at length two cases where rational decisions are made about suicide in the face of painful disease, and in which the philosophical inspiration is made clear. His political mentor, the aged senator Corellius Rufus, decided, at an advanced age, to put an end to his sufferings from gout by voluntary starvation (Ep. 1.12). Pliny writes that he was led to his decision by 'the supremacy of reason which takes the place of necessity for Wise Men' (summa ratio quae sapientibus pro necessitate est), and he sets out a calculation of advantages and disadvantages in Corellius' situation. This is a clear allusion to the Stoic theory of suicide, according to which the decision is to be made in accordance with a calculation, not of the good things and bad things in one's life (because only virtue and vice were good and bad and everything else 'indifferent'), but of the 'positive indifférents', life itself being no more than a 'positive indifferent'. Corellius' reasons for living, such as family, friends and good repute, were outweighed by the sufferings caused by his progressive disease. He had listened to the pleas of his family, but his decision was unshaken.64 Then again, Titius Aristo, who was also facing painful illness, decided not to commit suicide after rationally considering the pros and cons of his situation. Of his determination to rest his decision on the assessment by his doctors of his chances of recovering, Pliny writes 'Many people have his impulse (impetus) and urge (instinctus) to forestall death, but the ability to deliberate and to examine the arguments for dying as reason 62 The Letters of Pliny (n.9, above) 243. 63 Later, he conveys a heroic character to the suicide of a wife and her terminally ill husband, by making a comparison with Arria' s initiative (Ep. 6.24). 64 Note that Corellius' statement Kapuca, a claim to constantia that was justified in his case, appears in a suicide scene of which Epictetus is critical (2.15.5-6).</page><page sequence="16">100 VITA VIGILIA EST urges, and to accept or reject the idea of living or not, is the mark of a truly great mind' (1.22.10).65 There is, finally, a touch of irony to savour. Some have found in the account of the Elder Pliny's death by his nephew ( Ep . 6.16) a celebration of Stoic rationality, self-sacrifice, and social conscience, in sharp contrast to the account attributed to Suetonius, in which a voyage of scientific curiosity ends in the Elder Pliny being unable to turn back and committing suicide by another's hand in order to end his physical distress.66 Though his nephew claims to have based his account on the immediate reports of eye witnesses (6.16.22), one cannot help thinking that the later account is closer to the way the Elder Pliny would have seen it. So far, we have been stressing the virtual absence from the Elder Pliny of certain topics that feature prominently in his nephew's Letters. But as regards the silence about Barea Soranus, they coincide. The younger Pliny devotes two letters, 7.29 and the much longer 8.6, to a discussion of the senatorial decree that was inscribed on bronze and set up close to Rome on the Via Tiburtina. Though he had the curiosity to look up the actual decree in the acta senātus and quotes a great deal of it verbatim, he never mentions the proposer. And yet it would have strengthened his picture of the demoralisation of the senate under Claudius to note that even a high-minded consul designate like Barea could stoop to flattery of an imperial freedman. We might want to relate this reticence to the respect for the philosophical martyrs that he demonstrates so fully in his correspondence. If so, the silence of his uncle becomes more, not less, puzzling, because his work shows no such respect or even interest. But here too political opportunism, but of a different kind, may play a part, for the family of Barea Soranus was part of Titus' past. Suetonius reports that between his military service and his quaestorship, Titus was married twice. The second wife was one Marcia Furnilla 'of a distinguished family, whom he divorced after acknowledging a daughter' ( Titus 4.2). She was the daughter of Antonia Furnilla and Q. Marcius Barea Sura, who was presumably the brother of Barea Soranus.67 The second marriage must belong in 63 or 64, the divorce should be in 65 or 66, just at the time when, in the aftermath of the Pisonian conspiracy, Nero turned on Barea Soranus and Thrasea Paetus, two virtuous senior senators, both adherents of Stoicism. Marcia had become, as Barbara Levick says, 4 a political liability'.68 Barea was accused of resistance to Nero's expropriations as proconsul of Asia and of friendship with Rubellius Pļautus who had been in exile in Asia at the time and subsequently put to death by Nero. In addition, Barea's son-in- law had recently been sent into exile for complicity in the conspiracy (Tac. Ann. 16.21, 23, 30-33). Pliny's Natural History was dedicated to Titus, with whom Pliny had served in the army in Germany (praef. 3) in the early years of Nero. For Pliny either to celebrate or to condemn Titus' erstwhile father-in-law could have been embarrassing for Titus: the part of discretion was silence. The caution of the Elder Pliny has no doubt deprived us of some fascinating information about philosophers and philosophy in his period. But, given the persecution that some 65 M.

We can compare, with his own mixed assessment of philosophy and philosophers, the zeal with which Quintilian entered into Domitian' s prejudices, branding philosophers as, at best, idle debaters who contributed nothing to public life; at worst, pretentious hypocrites who, unlike the real philosophers of the past, preached virtue as a means of concealing their vices.69 Instead Pliny represented philosophy as one aspect of Greek culture which, when applied to the study of the physical world and the practical benefit of human beings, had much to contribute to his own scientific investigations. It is not surprising that he felt an affinity with the work of the Sextii and their adherents, Cornelius Celsus and Papirius Fabianus. Like him, they were deeply concerned with natural science, while also being teachers of practical morality. They had another possible appeal for Pliny as well: profoundly patriotic as he was, Pliny liked celebrating the one philosophical sect that Rome herself had produced.70 Yet Pliny's attitudes are not simple. We should be warned of that by the ironic anecdote that we took as our text at the start. It is true that the Greek philosopher Lacydes is there presented as comical; but, as we have said, the Romans whose sapientia consists in a taste for pâté de foie gras are made absolutely ridiculous. In fact, it is neither the philosopher nor the Romans who win Pliny's true admiration here. No, it is the goose, a creature more loyal, more patriotic, and more perceptive than any of them. 69 Quint., Inst. 1 praef. 15, 11.1.35, 12.2.7, 12.3.12, cf. Domitian's view in Plin. Ep. 10.58.6 (edam moribus!). 70 In his one reference to the founder (HN 18.274), Pliny tells us that Q. Sextius demonstrated his practical grasp of scientific agriculture at Athens, where he was 'one of the Roman students of philosophy'.</page></plain_text>
