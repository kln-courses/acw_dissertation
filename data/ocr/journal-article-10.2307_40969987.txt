<plain_text><page sequence="1">BIOLOGICAL GLIMPSES OF SOME ASPECTS OF HUMAN SOCIOLOGY BY H. HEDIGER W hen modern man considers his current social and psychological problems, he often reflects on the mores of the animal or non- human being which guided or still guide a less complicated, that is a more simple, a more natural life. There is practically no biologi- cal problem, in the widest sense, that has not been studied exten- sively on the animal level, e.g., aggression, sex, learning, child rearing, language, sleep, reactions to drugs, radiation, surgical interventions, space travels, etc. But the animal chosen for such comparative studies is almost without exception a domesticated animal belonging to the tiny groups of animal forms (I avoided the term species on purpose) which are so comfortably adapted to laboratory conditions, and indeed are known as laboratory animals, such as the white mouse, the white rat, the guinea pig, the hamster, the rabbit, the dog, the cat, etc. In my opinion it should be kept in mind that all these animals are man-made. They are, so to speak, abstract forms of animals which do not exist in nature; they do not represent genu- ine creatures with truly natural behavior. Representatives of wild animal species, such as the rhesus monkey, are used only occasion- ally for such comparative studies. Even then mostly isolated indi- viduals are studied in extremely simplified environmental condi- tions which do not allow a full display of natural behavior, but rather show rudimentary or even neurotic behavior. Experi- ments with brain-damaged animals and domesticated animals can yield extremely valuable results, but they are of little value when we are looking for basic phenomena of natural life in order to compare it with the stressful life of modern, highly civilized man. A certain area of space is one of the fundamental needs of every</page><page sequence="2">BIOLOGICAL GLIMPSES 531 creature. It is as important as a certain amount of food, and as with food, not only the quantity but also the quality is decisive. Territoriology cannot be studied with laboratory animals because these anthropogenic animals have been grotesquely deformed pre- cisely in this relation. One of the first duties of biologists responsible for zoological gardens is to provide their animals with an adequate territory which contains all essential elements for their well-being. Field observers have added a lot of welcome knowledge to the specialty of biology at the zoological gardens. It is from this point of view (admittedly a rather peculiar one) that I would like to give some suggestions. Consequently, the fol- lowing remarks are not so much a contribution to a biological prolegomena, which the editor asked for, but rather an essay which looks backward in our evolution. As I had the privilege, not only of studying the territories of many so-called free living animals, but also of studying non-civilized human tribes, both in Melanesia and in New Guinea, where people still live in the stone age (with- out metals), it is obvious to me that a comparison of animal terri- tories and primitive human territories would perhaps be fruitful. I shall restrict myself to three points, namely: propriety, sex and social hierarchy. 1. Propriety (Territory) As already mentioned, a certain area of space, a territory, belongs to the primordial possessions of most animals and also of early humans.1 Normally, a territory is a measurable piece of the surface of the earth and often the individual territories of the members or groups of the same species touch one another like the pieces of a mosaic. A territory has to be acquired or conquered and more or less permanently defended, mainly against members of the same species. Very often the borders become settled in time and re- spected by the neighbors, so that invasions and fights become rare i H. Hediger, "The Evolution of Territorial Behavior," in Social Life of Early Men (New York: Wenner Foundation for Anthropological Research, 1961).</page><page sequence="3">532 SOCIAL RESEARCH and symbols of ownership, that is, demarcation of the territory, suffice.2 We know that some individual animals, including all species from fish to mammal and human, are unsuccessful in establishing their own territory or, if established, their territory is too small. This situation causes restlessness and aggression and encourages disease, as R. Mykytowycz has shown recently in experiments with Australian rabbits.3 Lack of sufficient space causes, among other negative reactions, more or less constant friction. I am thinking of an aquarium in which three individuals were unable to establish a territory as the other members of their group did. The inferior fish had to hide behind a stone all the time, while the more lucky ones swam unmolested in their well defined area of water. The biggest territory extended diagonally through the container and was the closest to the surface, which means it was also the richest in oxygen. Poorer territories were much smaller and closer to the bottom of the tank. This commonplace situation in an aquarium reminds me of a corresponding human situation. When I say that this makes me think of certain humans who have to live in terribly crowded places at the periphery or in dull corners of our big cities, I might be charged with anthropomorphism, the deadly sin for an animal psychologist. In fact, I mean to say that some aquarium fish and human slum dwellers have to live under conditions which are far from the optimum, far from normal, under unbiological condi- tions, so to speak. The most biological, that is, the most natural way of dwelling is without doubt to live in a self-contained house surrounded by a garden. It makes an enormous psychological difference whether a man owns a piece of land and a house, a real territory, or whether he is merely tolerated under certain condi- tions for a certain time in an apartment which does not belong 2 H.

VI, no. 2, pp. 142- 155.</page><page sequence="4">BIOLOGICAL GLIMPSES 533 to him. It is easily understandable that most people who have not yet lost all contact with nature dream of this most territory- like, most natural and therefore most healthy way of living. Wherever it is still possible this type of dwelling should be prac- ticed. But of course, this ideal situation cannot be realized every- where. It is impossible to flatten out big cities for this purpose. Recently, in different countries of Europe a new type of home is becoming more and more popular: the ownership-apartment (eigentums-wohnung) which is a characteristic compromise with the ideal self-contained house. In Switzerland, this type of flat which you can buy and possess like a house, has appeared first on slopes, so that the small garden in front of the upper flat forms part of the roof of the lower flat. The result of this arrangement is a number of obliquely superimposed, isolated territorities on a mini- mum of surface. Another biologically important advantage of the slope-apartment is the fact that every territory has its individual entrance. The common entrances and halls of the traditional apartment house are less biological. As I have pointed out several times,4 a natural territory is not a homogenous space but a highly differentiated one. Among the many fixed points which are connected by typically constructed pathways, the home is by far the most important fixed point, and very often the entrance to this outstanding center of the territory is of special significance. I have for several reasons resisted here the temptation of com- paring the different fixed points in the territories of animals and men (bathroom, storeroom, etc.). G. Morf has pointed out several similarities.5 I will discuss briefly only one fixed point here, namely the fireplace, because in my opinion the tremendous im- portance of the fire has so far rather been neglected by biologists as well as by anthropologists and sociologists. It has become fashionable to consider man merely as an animal, as a naked ape,6 but it seems to me that in view of the many com- 4H, Hediger, (see note 2) and H.

Morris, The Naked Ape (London: Jonathan Cape, 1967).</page><page sequence="5">534 SOCIAL RESEARCH mon traits, the important differences have not yet received the at- tention they actually deserve, apart from the language problem and the spirit in the sense of Geist (science, art, religion). I would like to concentrate on the fireplace, a highly important fixed point in the territory of even the most primitive human races. The art of manipulating and making fire presents an abso- lutely sharp difference between man and the animal kingdom. There is no slow transition in this case as in morphological evolu- tion. Either the manipulation of fire is known or it is not known; there is nothing in between. In no animal territory will we find a fireplace; this is an absolute monopoly of man. There is a fireside in the territory (home) of even the most primitive native. Perhaps we may say that man became man when he was able to manipulate fire. According to J. Biegert 7 the Australopithecines had no knowledge of handling fire, whereas Neanderthal man was very clever in making and manipulating fire. He also buried his dead. Man is not just a naked ape, as D. Morris 8 describes him, he is also a fire maker and perhaps endowed with an instinct of re- ligion. Fire is indeed one of the most decisive elements in the development of organismic life on our planet and in the develop- ment of Homo faber. It is therefore surprising that comparatively little attention has been paid to this most important phenomenon. One of the few authors who, to my knowledge, has dealt with fire as a culture trait and has pointed out the social significance of fire is C. O. Sauer. He states that "Through all ages the use of fire has perhaps been the most important skill to which man has ap- plied his mind. Fire gave to man, a diurnal creature, security by night from other predators. Hearth and home are still synonymous. About the fireside the last duties of the day are done, the events of the day reviewed and the morrow planned. The fireside was the beginning of social living, the place of communication and 7 J. Biegert, "Herkunft und Werden des Menschen," in Ur- und frühgeschichtliche Archaeologie der Schweiz, vol. I, pp. 69-88. (Zurich: 1968). * D. Morris, op. cit.</page><page sequence="6">BIOLOGICAL GLIMPSES 535 reflection." 9 I would like especially to emphasize this last phrase. It makes understandable, among many other facts, the tenacity we find in some people, who are in possession of a fireplace, for example in London, and who are not willing to give up this exceedingly meaningful installation, although it causes the dreaded smog, also known in many other cities, which in certain meteoro- logical conditions brings the death of a number of citizens suscepti- ble to this dangerous air condition. I mention this fact only to stress the amazing subjective significance of the personal fireside. Wherever it is possible to establish this outstanding fixed point without doing harm to other people, it should, in my opinion, be recommended. It is a basic element of the human territory. It is a general biological law that the artificial animal territory with which we provide so-called captive animals in the zoos can be a thousand or ten thousand times smaller than their natural territories because, for example, a family of lions in the zoo does not have to breed a lot of antelopes, warthogs, zebras, etc. in its own enclosure. The keeper provides enough food and water regu- larly.10 Correspondingly, modern man does not need such a large territory as does primitive agricultural man. Modern man can buy a lot of things with money earned in his profession. In the animal kingdom there is no money and no especially learned pro- fession. To summarize: In our times the ideal, that is the most natural, biological way of life is life in an area as close to the original territory and fireside as possible. Modern sociology in the widest sense should try to explore the possibility of fulfilling this ideal. One of the main obstacles in attaining this aim is the fact that today there are just too many people. There is an enormous amount of literature dealing with the human "population explo- sion." This term, in my opinion, is a misnomer. An explosion is • C. O. Sauer, Agricultural Origins and Dispersals: The Domestication of Animals and Foodstuffs (Massachusetts: The M.I.T. Press, 1969), p. 10. io H. Hediger, (see note 2).</page><page sequence="7">536 SOCIAL RESEARCH normally a blast of a very short duration. What we all fear and what is described as an inevitable catastrophe is a permanent in- crease of the human population. Personally I do not believe in this danger. I believe rather that mankind has already passed the dangerous peak. Never before was there a world-wide discussion of the phenomenon erroneously called the population explosion. Until recently, most people were not aware of this danger. Never before have so many people recognized this danger as they do today. Never before today has the slogan of family planning been so popular. For instance, in India, one of the most explosive breed- ing places, you find posters recommending reasonable family plan- ning practically at every corner, even on the backs of innumerable cars. Huge factories of contraceptive devices were opened in India during 1969 with tremendous publicity. This will not be without effect. In other countries, however, as in many parts of Switzer- land, there is still a system of premium payments for numerous children. Kinderzulagen (supplements for children) are still promised to workers and employees. There is a wide gap between the goal of reducing the number of children by legal measures and the practice of paying premiums for children. There are many indications that the present population peak will slowly be lowered. In some countries the first symptoms can already be found. Every territory, like every individual, has its own metabolism. The natural condition is one in which a territory produces enough food for its inhabitants and absorbs its own waste. Mass conglom- eration creates unbiological situations in both senses. The produc- tion of food as well as the removal of waste become biological and aesthetic problems. Contrary to many animal species, which have special fixed points within their territories for urination and defecation, man has primarily no such fixed point within his terri- tory. Man by instinct does not belong to the group which uses the localized type of defecation, but to the group which uses the diffuse type, like the apes.11 I know of some primitive tribes who were forced by their former colonial governments to construct outhouses 11 Ibid.</page><page sequence="8">BIOLOGICAL GLIMPSES 537 in every small village. These were constructed by order but were not normally used. Civilized men, for the last few centuries only, belong to the group using the localized type not by instinct but by reason. Otherwise, the enormous concentration of people would have made it difficult to escape infectious diseases and sur- vive. But there are mass-conditioned problems which have not been solved with the same effectiveness. The fact that the greater part of mankind today is suffering from hunger, especially from a de- ficiency of protein, while a minority suffers from over-nourishment is, in my opinion, one of the most urgent problems to be solved. It is more than an anachronism that in many parts of the world enormous quantities of surplus food are destroyed instead of being preserved and transported to areas where food is scarce. I am sorry to say that the destruction of tomatoes, other vegetables and fruits also happens in Switzerland. This is an unhuman, an anti-social and an unbiological state. When tons of tomatoes are thrown into rivers, a dangerous contribution is also made to water pollution, another pernicious effect of mass metabolism. Garbage removal also presents a chronic problem. Modern human mass concentra- tion excludes the biological self-cleaning of the original territory. A major contribution to the ever growing garbage and pollution consists in one-way packing. This is directly connected with mod- ern advertising and selling methods. It is entirely paradoxical and unbiological that on the one hand there is a majority of people lacking the minimum for life while a minority spends an amazing amount of energy and money to create ever more extravagant wishes in a minority of people already suffering from a menacing unbiological abundance. Every effort should be made to avoid this basically unbiological and anti-social situation. The industrial state, as it has been described by J. K. Galbraith,12 is full of contradictory development, that is, development in two opposite directions. Biological evolution probably always goes in 12 J. K. Galbraith, The New Industrial State (New York: The New American Library, Inc., 1968).</page><page sequence="9">538 SOCIAL RESEARCH one direction (with minor deviations) but never in opposite di- rections. It is exactly this type of contradictory evolution which we find characteristically in modern highly civilized society. This is a direct way to trouble and crisis. Striking examples are: The lack of food and the surplus of food; pollution and excess garbage and the excessive production of packing material; lack of basic elements of living and the search for superfluous and luxury articles (ad- vertising, marketing); unhygienic conditions and exaggerated cos- metics; excessive poverty and excessive wealth; restricting sex and stimulating sex; social oppression and intensification of social am- bition; lack of education and extreme specialization, and many others. To a certain degree (with the exception of pollution, em- barrassing packing waste and propaganda) these contradictions have existed since men started to live in cities, but there can be no doubt about the fact that these contradictions have grown dispro- portionately large in comparison with the growth of cities. To me it seems urgent to find means for diminishing this paradoxical growth in opposite directions. The tension can only be decreased by reasonable compromises, by agreements which recognize the responsibility of those who profit from mass society to handle its excesses; for instance, those advertising organizations which con- tinuously search for new sale possibilities, which create constantly more refined and unbiological, even unhealthy needs, should con- tribute to those who are not in a position to satisfy their most vital needs by some form of tax. In a similar way those who cause most of the pollution should contribute to the building of cleaning installations, and so forth. 2. Sex In this paper it is not possible to give more than a few superficial indications, a few glimpses of sections of human life from a biolo- gist's point of view. One point which cannot be overlooked in this connection is the present sex wave. The idea that sexual intercourse is to be regarded as a perfectly harmless social enter-</page><page sequence="10">BIOLOGICAL GLIMPSES 539 tainment or play has become very popular. Therefore it is much less popular today to discourage the perfectly free use of contra- ceptive pills. As in many other cases, when modern man feels uncertain in matters related to biology he looks around in his neighborhood, that is, among primitive tribes and in infrahuman species. Sexual behavior in all its forms is said to be "natural," biological, and it is expected that we will find an absolutely free sexual life in natives following an original natural life style on some paradise-like islands or in far away virgin forests. This image of our immediate ancestors, of the so-called savages, however, is entirely wrong. As far as my modest ethnological knowledge goes, sexual life of primi- tive tribes is by no means free and unrestricted. There is an enormous amount of literature on this subject, which shows an amazing number of strict ceremonies and rules to which the mem- bers of most "primitive" groups (especially the young and unmar- ried) are subjected. I am more familiar with the sexual behavior of infrahuman animals. As a zoo director, I have to be, because the propagation of every species held in captivity is one of our principal aims.18 Freedom, in the widest sense, is predominant in the wishful think- ing of men - freedom in every relation, in space, time, sex, society. As I have pointed out several times14 and as we observe every day in the zoo - and confirm in the field - there is no trace of such liberty in the animal kingdom. On the contrary, there are strong, often inexorable rules controlling all of these spheres, including sex and social position. Most big mammals have sexual intercourse only at long intervals or only during a short season. But if we compare wild animals with domestic animals, or so- called primitive human tribes with highly civilized humans we is H. Hediger, "Observations on Reproduction Behaviour in Zoo Animals," in Ciba Foundation Colloquia on Endocrinology, Vol. Ill (London: Churchill Ltd., 1952); and H.

Hediger, (see note 2).</page><page sequence="11">540 SOCIAL RESEARCH find a striking emancipation from all of these fetters. Concerning this phenomenon we have to deal with domestication in relation to animals, and with civilization or self-domestication in relation to men. There is no room here to differentiate among domestica- tion, self-domestication and civilization. One common trait of these phenomena is a pronounced hypersexuality, which in con- temporary human society is reaching a peak hardly attained by previous human cultures. As D. Morris has pointed out, man in a way is the "sexiest ape." 15 From my special biological point of view this is an unnatural, unbiological state. It seems therefore understandable that there is also a (natural) trend against it. As in the "population explosion" there are indications and symptoms that the sex wave has already passed its peak. Not only the domes- tication of animals but also the self-domestication of man (or civilization) approach the creation of pathological symptoms. Beyond this point there is no longer sound evolution but rather destruction and degeneration. Under the management of man some highly domesticated animals such as the cow, the pig and the hen have become miserable but highly effective protein pro- ducing devices. In the eyes of a biologist they are horrible carica- tures of their wild ancestors. Does civilization drive man to a tremendous hypertrophy of sex (and cortex)? 3. Social Hierarchy It is commonplace knowledge that in most non-solitary animals we find a strict specific social structure, a distinct social hierarchy, such as in apes or in humans. However, in the animal kingdom the social hierarchy, once established, is (at least for a certain time) comparatively stable until death, disease or other important events create a change; in modern man, on the other hand, there is almost normally a continuous uninterrupted competition. The aim of this competition in man is as a rule not only a higher social posi- tion but a higher financial income (which is in itself unbiological). is D. Morris, op. cit.</page><page sequence="12">BIOLOGICAL GLIMPSES 541 Parenthetically, it might be mentioned that to the psychoanalyst, money (at least in some cases) means dirt or feces. Konrad Lorenz 16 is perfectly correct in stating (as a biologist) that there is no sillier product of human evolutionary selection than the haste, the rush of work in Western civilized men. The manager disease has be- come a well-known and dreaded conception. It is the result of an uninterrupted hunt for more money and higher social position. Why not try to find contentment with a reasonable income and social position? Why this unbiological and unhealthy aspiration for higher and higher positions? Not everybody has the qualifica- tions and the opportunities for leadership or top positions; many pay too high a price in this futile chase. Many animals behave, if I may say so, more reasonably and content themselves with a mediocre situation which sometimes offers certain advantages. I am perfectly aware that some of the ideas presented in this very short paper are rather heretical. They were private ideas and I did not ask for their publication. When I finally consented to the editor's request, I did so keeping in mind a statement by C. and W. M. S. Russell: ". . . the most urgent problem of sociology is the conservation of variance." 17 16 K. Lorenz, Das sogenannte Böse.
