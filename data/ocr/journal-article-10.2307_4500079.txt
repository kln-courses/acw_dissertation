Witchcraft, a recurrent subject of early modern images, continues to confound art-historical interpretations caught up in binary oppositions such as the real and the fictitious or the rational and the irrational. Admittedly early modern interest in the occult, including the perse- cution of people for being witches, has consistently received diverse explanations. Hugh Trevor-Roper argued that witchcraft emerged out of religious strife and Reformation attempts to control religious dissent;1 Keith Thomas also conjoined religion and witchcraft but argued for the importance of seeing it as part of local vil- lage relations and rivalries.2 Lyndal Roper took up the ongoing argument for gender-based persecution, but argued for a psychoanalytical reading of women's subjec- tivities and sexuality in relation to demonological images and debates.3 More recently misogyny has been dis- placed, for example in Stuart Clark's lengthy study of demonology as the site for the formation of inversion and binaries that shaped rational thought in early modern Europe.4 Art history has tended to follow the lead of textual sources, and thus has addressed images of witchcraft either as allegorical or as related to the actual persecution of certain sectors of society, especially women. Where art history has been less resourceful is in addressing the visual issues raised by these images: what does it mean to bring visual form to the invisible, and how do these images pertain to con- temporaneous changes in conceptions of the visual image? After all, a large proportion of these images are OXFORD ART JOURNAL 30.3 2007 521</page><page sequence="2">Reviews from the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and these tend to appear in the context of collectors' cabi- nets in which natural specimens, bizarre objects and exotic items brought from distant places intermingled and produced new ideas of visual observation and knowl- edge. These images can no longer be relegated to a pre- modern world of religiosity and superstition, but how to address their seemingly contradictory character? Two recent books take up this challenge, each going about it in a very different way. Hults's The Witch as Muse addresses a wide range of images of witchcraft, organising these chronologically into separate chapters, most of which are devoted to a particular artist. Spanning from Albrecht DOrer in the sixteenth century to Goya in the nineteenth century, the study situates its argument within the motivations of artistic production. In effect, the separate parts are bound together with the idea that 'images of witchcraft helped male artists enhance their status by proving their imaginative and intellectual pro- wess and by aligning them to rhetorical and political strategies of elite groups'. Hults frames this broad survey of witchcraft imagery with an account of its long and con- tested history and historiography, examining with con- siderable thoroughness diverse strands of argumentation from social history, art history and anthropology. This is followed by a chapter on the grotesque female body and its relation to the idea of artistic self fashioning. It is here that a clear divide is drawn between the representation of female deviance and its place within male creativity. Hults does address theoretical positions that have ques- tioned such binary oppositions, especially around the body, individual subjectivity and social space. Bakhtin's influential concept of the grotesque body is regarded as being closer to conceptions of women's bodies, although its disrupting force within social space is never explored. Likewise Mary Douglas's important conceptualisation of the purity and pollution divide is associated with the rep- resentation of the permeable body of the witch, but less attention is given to its larger social implications, its links to stages of liminality and the disruption of the order and disorder divide. Hults even acknowledges that psy- choanalytical approaches, for instance Julia Kristeva's notion of the abject, are in synch with historical evidence on how witchcraft itself disturbed bodily boundaries. Hults's overall argument about the relation of these images to the artistic imagination recalls Joseph Koerner's interpretation of Baldung's images of witches as a kind of double self-portrait of viewer and artist, in which the contradictions and uncertainties of subjectiv- ity intermingle in an unsettling process of interpret- ation.5 However, instead of arguing for the struggles of subjectivity, Hults proposes a self-fashioning of identity within a courtly society, a concept she draws from Stephen Greenblatt, although with less emphasis on the internal processes of a fragmented subject." In other words the pursuit of an artistic imagination remains a social and professional goal and is not conceived in terms of interiority. Also, unlike arguments such as those of Koerner and Greenblatt that locate changing notions of identity within a particular historical context, Hults retains the same basic notion of the artistic subject as she addresses images produced within diverse histori- cal and cultural specificities. If there are many instances in which her interpretation of the images gains speci- ficity, it is because the argument for artistic self- fashioning is combined with an analysis of the images in terms of their focus on women and the gendering the fem- inine as lascivious, irrational and obscene. Yet this only works to produce a more decisive divide, one that ulti- mately serves to separate internal experience from exter- nal effects. In effect, the combination of the two parts of the argument tends to reinscribe the gender divide the book seeks to question; the idea of the irrational that permeates the interpretation of the images in relation to women constantly turns into the creative imagination when it pertains to the negotiations of the male artist. Claudia Swan's Art, Science and Witchcraft in Early Modern Holland considers images of witchcraft within a very different frame, namely the emergence of new modes of visual representation in relation to the study of natural history. Instead of a broad range of images, she focuses on the work of the Antwerp artist Jacques de Gheyn II, addressing in particular 'the perplexing oscil- lation in de Gheyn's oeuvre between scientific naturalism and fantastic imagery'. Swan introduces this apparent distinction by starting with a sheet of sketches that combines renderings of the natural world and bizzare images of the occult, only to return to it at the end of the book with the divide considerably diminished. The distinction is what structures the book. Thus the first part of the book sets out to examine the images pro- duced in relation to new conceptions of natural history while the second addresses representations of witchcraft in relation to early modern conceptions of imagination. It is by examining these concepts not only in relation to nat- uralist and artistic practices but also within broader epis- temological terms that the opposition between the two types of images begins to dissolve. Ultimately Swan's aim is to tackle the crucial issue of how particular forms of knowledge relate to particular representational genres, thus contributing in substantial ways to the thorny ques- tion of the relation of art and science. Swan offers an insightful discussion of the emergence of images in relation to natural history, and its location within larger practices of image production, including the emergence of a vocabulary to certify the truthfulness of images. The well-known term naer het laven (from life) is considered in terms of its broad circulation as well as within Karl van Mander's 1604 influential discus- sion. Thus while Swan devotes the first chapter to an analysis of Gheyn's production of works in this mode, this is followed by a chapter on how the mode is sub- verted by de Gheyn in order to argue for the authorial presence. This is followed by a case study on natural his- tory's ubiquitous blowfish, which examines with much care the specificities of the transition between object 522 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 30.3 2007</page><page sequence="3">Reviews and image, between visual inscription and natural and knowledge, and between scientific image and artistic concerns. This is as close as Swan comes to broaching the larger implications of the process of representation initially proposed by Foucault's The Order of Things. In the latter, the divide between nature and artifice takes a different turn, whereby the turn to observation and cat- egorisation moves away from the mimetic and organic into a vocabulary of categorisation and text. The focus on the blow fish offers a closer analysis of the status of the image within science and art, contributing to an understanding of how natural knowledge was produced through a strategic combination of mimetic images and schematic representation. Swan's discussion of early modern concepts of the imagination is particularly effective, especially its atten- tion to the anxieties surrounding a sense that was thought to produce mental images which were never entirely stable or controllable. The imagination's location both within sense perception and the storage of memory, offers an intriguing way in which to approach images that conjoin the overtly natural with the overtly bizarre for it interlinks scientific observation with inven- tion and external vision with internal processes of thought. Moreover, Swan does not stop at an abstract notion of artistic invention and seeks to consider the production of representational genres, and how these increasingly recognizable and distinctive visual vocabul- aries might intersect with processes of cognition and thus with new forms of knowledge. One could say that the book's structural divide does set an inherent separ- ation between science and art (external knowledge, internal imagination), but it is remarkable how it man- ages to negotiate this split and to show not only that the distinctive definition of each was always forged within the other, but also how we now tend to impose it retrospectively on these images. The question of the imagination is also crucial to Hults, who regards it as the site in which artistic creativ- ity is measured and verified in the social world. The books also meet in the work of de Gheyn, to which Hultz devotes one of her chapters. Hults offers very vigorous analysis of images in terms of gendering principles, the representation of 'the wicked, vain and ineffectual prac- tice of ignorant women, understood as inversion of true science, practiced by many of his patrons and friends'. Swan, however, works at the early modern notion of inversion, and manages to bring new insights into the overlapping yet emergent concepts of nature and arti- fice; even more commendable is the way this discussion of constructions of knowledge is linked to concerns about the relation between interior self and external appearances. A good example is Swan's discussion of de Gheyn's The Preparation for the Witches' Sabbath, engraved around 1610. Here Swan interweaves the prin- cipal of inversion fundamental to the technology of print- making with pictorial inversion in terms of the natural order conveyed through subject, details and medium. She traces the aspects of inversion in images of witchcraft by DOrer and Baldung, and argues for a shift, one in which the unsettling of the perceived natural order is disturbed at the level of picture making rather than being evoked through a metaphorical image. By working at the disjunctures in the image between mimesis and natural observation, whereby the most vivid parts turn out to be the illusionary elements, the process of viewing is shown to be one in which the internal mutates into the external and vice versa. Swan also draws on popular prints of witchcraft, and through this intersection of genres, inversion turns further into a process of incon- stancy. The concept is explored through de Lancre's L'lnconstance, in which the devil personifies instability. This inside/outside exchange is further developed by con- sideration of de Gheyn's anthropomorphic and zoomorphic images, which represent the moment of transformation from natural form to facial features, from external to internal, with nature as the maker of fantastical images. It is the notion of instability that is shown to characterise not only the relation between diverse modes of represen- tation but also the imagination itself, which could both produce dangerous illusions and creative forces. Hults also deploys early modern notions of inversion, but tends to do so to further her argument about a divi- sion between images of the irrational and the new ration- alised dynastic order. A good example appears in the chapter in which Hults addresses how occult images in the Habsburg court frequently were part of cabinets of curiosities and served as objects of discussion for elite court circles. Hults's analysis of David Teniers's remark- able painting of a scene of witchcraft framed by an illu- sionist wreath composed of flora specimens is full of insights. She shows how the natural properties of the items on the frame are interlinked in complex ways with beliefs in medicinal and occult practices. She then pro- poses it to be an inversion of Jesuit images in which the host is framed by a floral wreath and serves as a counter to and a recovery of nature from popular magic. Yet, within cabinets of curiosities and picture cabinets, these images have been shown to work not only within the intersections of nature and artifice, but also within a new awareness of distinctive genres of painting. These processes of reformulation of the visual image, of the production and negotiation of pictorial vocabularies, were focused particularly on images that combined reli- gious scenes (especially Virgin and Child) with highly illusionistic still-life like wreaths. As Victor Stoichita has argued, these images, frequently found in the imaginary painted picture cabinets that show art collections in the making, represent a kind of in-between space, one in which previously distinct types of painting are brought into new interrelations produced by the space of the cabinet.7 What then needs to be considered is how these images of witchcraft are part of a continuum of curiosities, which ranged from natural specimens, mimetic images of these specimens, precious and bizarre objects as well as paintings previously deemed to OXFORD ART JOURNAL 30.3 2007 523</page><page sequence="4">Reviews be discordant. While these images still carried the moral incentives proposed by Hults, these were no longer as stable within interpretation as they intersected with con- cerns about viewing and the transformation from object to image and from one pictorial vocabulary to another. Jacques de Gheyn's engraved Self-Portrait, discussed by both authors, is particularly telling of changing notions of the relation between interior view and exter- nal appearance. Hults provides the more thorough analy- sis of the image, reading the portrait as asserting the artist's elevated status by displaying a wide range of his skills, his inventiveness and his service to the prince. She also draws attention to the artist's relation to the female, be it by interpreting the miniature the artist holds as his wife, or by emphasising the artist behind the sitter working on an easel from a nude female model. Swan discusses the portrait when she introduces the personal and professional circumstances of de Gheyn career, and although she points to the display of the printmaker's tools and copper plate at the front of the image, she retains the idea asserted in the inscription that he defines himself primarily through the practice of painting. However, perhaps it would be useful to con- sider the portrait itself as negotiating between internal subjectivities and external identities, and thus between the imagination and visual observation. Instead of seeing the claims to be one mode of image making over the other, one might consider the relation between the things on display, starting with the portrait of de Gheyn as body but also as print transferred into another kind of portrait, the miniature portrait to which he points. A similar process of transmission is at play between the nude female model and the painting produced by the painter in the middle ground, and is further accentuated by the idea of transmission from object in nature (the tulips) and painted image, or printed image. In fact, de Gheyn's portrait in a convex mirror discussed by Swan asserts the idea of transmission as well as the process of distortion brought forth both from external and internal distortions. With this display of transmission and transformation, the artist's self-portrait opens up the cru- cial space between object and image and between nature and artifice, a space in which knowledge can be debated, assessed and reconsidered again.
