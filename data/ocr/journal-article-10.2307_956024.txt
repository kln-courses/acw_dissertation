<plain_text><page sequence="1">British folk Folk music of Britain and beyond by Frank Howes. Methuen, 70s The frivolously inclined could subtitle this book 'Foreigners start at Dover' or 'There's nowt so queer as Folk'. It is not essential for a racing correspondent to have been born in a stable or a writer on art music in the orchestra pit. But what is loosely called 'folk music' is a curious field with some rum runners, an unclassic course and no grandstand; and Mr Howes is very much an Ascot man even though he also knows and loves the point-to-point of English folk song. He admits some of this in his preface: I have tried to take as comprehensive a view as I can.... I have used the comparative method proper to anthro- pology ... I start from the British Isles, but I have not the knowledge, so huge is the sheer quantity of material, even to attempt to be comprehensive in my comparisons, so I have excused myself and my limited choice with the phrase 'And Beyond'. The more limited the comparative material, the more important that it should be expertly selected from the huge quantity and authoritatively pre- sented. The outstanding defect of this book is the inconsistency in content and in the quality of treat- ment between the English material, which Mr Howes knows intimately from the viewpoint of one who has lived through what is generally called the English Revival, and 'Beyond', of which he obvi- ously has little personal experience and about which he has some dizzying misconceptions. The order of chapters exposes this right away; the first four, dealing with definitions, technicalities and national characteristics, are the least adequate. The definition of folk music accepted here is that agreed in 1955 at the seventh Annual Conference of the International Folk Music Council: Folk music is the product of a musical tradition that has evolved through the process of oral transmission. The factors that shape the tradition are (1) continuity, which links the present with the past; (2) variation, which springs from the creative impulse of the individual or group, and (3) selection by the community, which determines the form or forms in which the music survives. By this definition, folk music is out of the old romantic-antiquarian situation and squarely in a time-place context. Mr Howes, however, is not, at least at the beginning of the book. 'Folk song of its very nature does not lend itself to history very conveniently and it is almost dateless'; 'folk song is recalcitrant to history, evades dates and defies logic'. It certainly evades the old school textbook kind of history given in the earlier chapters- determinedly monodic Antiquity, progress from then till now with a Golden Age or two on the way- which seems decidedly fusty in 1970. It is frequently expressed in anthropomorphic terms which endow sound phenomena with human behaviour, such as 'plainsong yielding to the desire for accompanying itself with another voice' and 'the Gaelic language demands a harp to match its peculiar lyricism." May one suggest that an objective study of the concepts and terminology of English writing on music c1890-1950 demands to be made? A list of dubious generalizations from these early chapters would make tedious reading and reasoned discus- sion of them would take a lot of space, so a few examples must suffice. Was the Church 'the cradle of European music through a millennium and a half', or was it the cradle of the writing-down, for ritual or prestige reasons, of certain kinds of music ? Is it true that 'the folk song of Spain and Spanish America has always the sound of a strummed guitar somewhere in the background'? Ask a singing bagpiper in the Celtic northwest of Spain or a group of Mexican Indians performing marriage songs with harp, violin and gourd rattles or a Colombian mestizo on the Pacific coast singing a 505</page><page sequence="2">romance. And yet, sandwiched in all this there is penetrating discussion of ornamentation, its func- tion and practice. One reaches the chapters on English matters with some relief. Mr Howes has not only lived through the early 20th-century upsurge of interest but knows and draws on many specialist studies, like Hugill's Shanties from the Seven Seas; his earlier feelings of the 'timeless' character of folk music have less place here. He tells sympathetically and with much personal insight the story of discovering, writing down, arranging and publishing in the 19th and early 20th centuries. And if the chapters on Ballads and English Folk Melody are neither exhaustive nor very high-powered in technical analysis, they are beautifully expressed examples of how many of the generation which was young when Cecil Sharp was elderly have felt about the English music which Sharp did so much to reveal to an urban public. These chapters are the heart of the book, and a warm heart it is. The Fringes (ie the Celtic fringes) do not come off so well; even the use of this title shows an Anglocentric viewpoint of these ethnically, linguisti- cally and culturally complex regions, and Brittany and Celtic Spain are not included. With the final chapter, on Scholarship and Related Problems, we get again something of the same mixture as at the beginning. A good deal of the kind of investigation and academic recognition which the author considers desirable and would like to see instituted is in fact already taking place-but taking place 'Beyond', in Scandinavia, in Eastern Europe, in the United States and to some extent in Latin America. And so one comes back to the original criticism, to which another even more fundamental may be added. Charles Seeger has written, in a magnificent study of Barbara Allen which Mr Howes does not mention: It cannot be too strongly emphasized that what is sung and the singing of it are not, musically speaking, two things, but one. Abstraction of the song from its singing is a necessary procedure in talking about music, that makes two things out of the original one. This is especially evident when the song is envisaged as printed words and notes. A singing of the song in a singing style other than that of its own tradition is likely to be a distortion com- parable to the translation of the words into a foreign language.' Throughout this book on folk song-for this, despite the title, is what it is primarily concerned with-there is hardly a suggestion of how it sounds, that it is a living thing on the ear, not a structure embalmed on paper, that tempo, timbre, delivery and projection are integral factors. Not one notated example carries so much as a tempo indica- tion, let alone a suggestion that the physical sounds inherent in an African pygmy dance-song, a Czech bagpipe tune to which words have been added and a Scottish border ballad are not identical, whatever similarities may be put upon them by singers in other situations or by Mr Howes in his study. He says of himself 'I was brought up on words and think in concepts', and it is therefore no accident that the best parts of his book are concerned with what was done about, or with or to English folk song. Elsewhere, he has tended to confuse the living thing with the 'necessary procedure'. JOAN RIMMER 2C.
