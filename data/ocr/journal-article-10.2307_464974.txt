<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE COLOR LINE TOM CONLEY Albert Ayme. PARADIGME DU BLEU JAUNE ROUGE. (with accompanying text by Jacques Henric). Paris: Edition Traversiere, 1979. Albert Ayme is virtually unknown in the United States. For twenty years he has been painting large horizontal canvasses that he tacks onto walls long enough to display the linear play, the rhythm and mix of their applications of primary colors. On first glance an American viewer would compare them to the great dipped murals of Morris Louis or the vast roller-paintings that Sam Francis has displayed with so much success in Paris and San Francisco over the last five years. Ayme's work appears to be of infinite proportional range since it can be designed or cut for any rectangular surface, either page or wall -but the bigger the better - and all the more as the shifts of colored lines can be combined in any variety of ways. The analogue might end here, for Ayme has acquired none of the fame of the other two and none of their buying power in the stock of a history of modern art. He does not stand at the threshold of a dematerialized art in the white regions of their paintings. Nor does he really calculate returns on variation and chance so easily as they. With Louis, monumental shapes are vertical; we have to see the effect of infu- sion in rooms that can display a good dozen works of different color mixes. Otherwise, Louis' experiments in crumpling and rehanging lose much when only one or two of the works gently spreads lightly soaked layers of pigments that interact so subtly along their alluvial edges. Unless we see how per- sistently he bathed the textile into different washes, none of the obstinate power of the matte surface of color emerges. But how much more radical are even one or two of Louis' pieces next to Sam Francis, when the later paintings-made by the application of thin acrylic on a housepaint roller extended with the aid of a long broomstick han- dle that can stretch a line of color across twenty square feet of floor -look more like neo-1968 tie-dye paintings inspired by the tee-shirt industry. The watery blends of pigments on strips a foot wide make us recall filaments of chlorophyll in pictures of spirogyra or blue-green algae seen under a microscope. Where Francis, faithful to the all-over ethic of the abstract expressionists, wills to infinitize it with endless organic associations, Louis stays in a laboratory of color. Where one is full of sunshine and aquatic life of Northern California, of a mythic world and a given nature of painting, the other deals strictly with the expressive power of sheaths of color. Albert Ayme has no residue of nature or any palpable substance in what his paintings represent. Although they sometimes unfold their shapes like the subtractive effect of the patches on Louis' and Francis' work, they have only a DIACRITICS Vol. 11 Pp. 58-67 0300-7162/81/0114-0058 $01.00 ? 1981 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">marginal rapport with what produced so many different responses to American abstrac- tion. Ayme would seem to have a place in the conceptual treatment of large canvases that followed many Americans' exasperated response to De Kooning. For after his legacy, what could anyone paint? The father of abstraction, he has not only left enough figural remainder - women, pots, bicycles, newspaper shreds, erotica here and there - in the paintings of the mid-fifties to be a palette painter translating forms of the world, but he has been applying them so massively and with such incessantly heroic distortion that painters could only jump back to a cubist ethic in reproducing the fragments of then- cheap and spacious lofts on the lower East Side, areas since occupied by doctors, lawyers and a few art historians. On second glance Albert Ayme would seem to reformulate the heritage of De Koon- ing through a conceptual feel for color. His work embraces the contours of a huge atelier, it reduces the color range to primaries or to variations on black and white, and it does, literally anyway, hang theory. By this I mean that the work interrogates every single vehi- cle of painterly effects that we know in abstract expressionism. The paintings are so longitudinal that classical proportions are out of question; because at least one major series has been appearing every year since 1963, they have been produced so fervently that continuity blends with indifference; they suscitate both commentary by Ayme himself in the margin of books and that of a host of artist-writers that they make of color an issue as complex as ecriture. Ponge, Ricardou, Lyotard, Michel Giroud and Gerard- Georges Lemaire have written of Ayme and modern art and soon, at next year's atelier at Cerisy-la-Salle, so will Roger Laporte, Jacques Derrida, Daniel Sibony and Philippe Lacoue- Labarthe. But Ayme's bibliography in no way evinces the power of his color or a delicate urgency of the paintings on the wall or floor. When they stretch across a wall at eye-level, they humiliate all vertical law: like an expanse of a colored labyrinth without shadow, they urge us to jump and swim in the currents of the maze and to make primary all the second- ary relations we have with sensation (with standing, walking, reasoning color, deciphering, historicizing tableaux, making meaning out of decor, having taste, etc.). And somehow the overneat title born in France a few years ago, support/surface - that used to call attention to a French conceptual art putting into view not just the work of art and its mode of crea- tion but especially the preconditions of wall, the two-dimensional tradition of its flattening of common objects or even its economy in the gallery or rivalry with American modes-does not apply to Ayme. Like De Kooning in the late-fifties, through the mechanics of his work, Ayme had surpassed the term long before it was coined. He con- ceived murals according to the surfaces of given walls; in the serial disposition of the paradigms he divested the tableau of stretcher-strips and wooden frames; and more decisively, he disbarred whatever incommensurable gap the French art-historical ideology had drawn between support and surface. Perhaps only now can he be seen since, as readers of arts that no longer make distinctions among medias or "disciplines," we have finally let authority of concepts with severely limited application become subservient to our collective process of making and seeing objects. But how, and in this, where is Ayme? However distant he may be from American activity, he certainly finds better analogs in masters of the New York school than in those who have been enshrined in art journals of the last decade. His fast tempo and blazing silence attests to that. In fact, Ayme's incongruity has all the more power next to currents either of general conceptualization of the art-object we have witnessed everywhere, or of frantic appeal to the new-old abstract expressionism of the 1980's. The punkiness of con- ceptual media is evident, but on the latter point let us recall Barbara Rose's choppy prose in her monthly contributions--as it were--to Vogue that eulogize young painters of "today" whom she has chosen in order to clean up performative excess in her self-sold program of a return to old values of abstract expressionism. Her recent show at New York University boils down to a program on the part of an artsy new right that advances a sort of supply-side economy of painting embodying the worth and dedication of great old masters of early post-war years. In this viewer's opinion, the paintings on display were all praiseworthy for their commitment to abstraction, but every selection looked supremely innocuous, each and every one a zombie next to the New York school. One wonders if diacritics I winter 1981 59</page><page sequence="3">editors had Barbara Rose elect insignificance in order to have us look at more daring advertisements next to her paragraphs in Vogue. By a curious turn of fate, her viewpoint turns the clock back to a period of cold war art. She now identifies not with Jasper Johns' painting of the star-spangled banner on the cover of her history of American art, but with the flag itself, with its red, white and blue bearing true-to-life art in the USA where progress in painting is her most important prod- uct. The great old masters of abstraction, we try to remember, had been tantamount to a Red menace in the field of American taste. Almost unwittingly she and many artists of the last twenty years make us aware of the aggressive elegance of abstract expressionism, and moreover of a need for a European simultaneity to remain part of it. This is why we choose to juxtapose Albert Ayme with Americans and not the early-century forebears- Klee, Mondrian, De Launay-he has cited so often as models of inspiration. When forced to speak of his work for a televised program on art and space which since has been incor- porated in Les Espaces variables - introduction a paradigme [Paris: Edition Traversiere, 1978], Ayme invoked the problem of two vastly different views of the plastic arts separating America and Europe. Beginning after the end of abstraction, the former went back to the everyday world and transferred it onto canvas, on photographic paper, museum floors, walls, mountain ranges, skyscrapers and great lakes. Ayme writes of the dynamic spatial givens of painting, noting: "At stake is a cosmic grafting (similar to a placing into orbit) for an insertion, an autonomous participation in life, in the functioning of nature, - and not of a phenomenon of mimesis (the world is a gigantic painting: Rauschenberg). Great artists, writes Malraux, do not transcribe the world, they rival it" [p. 10]. Any art that fails to interrogate the world or refuses to distort or even negate entirely and visibly its tangible shape does not absorb it. Rather, as in the paintings of Rauschenberg, fragments of New York or of the artist's body - the two are indifferently and happily the "same"- can be transferred onto silk- screen (in series of "jammers," both of nylon of wind-surf sails and of pyjamas), onto a painted frame (the mattress and bedspread on which he slept) or onto translucent plates (which copy American translations of Indian rituals printed over pictures of his former sculpture and painting). Rauschenberg's translation of the world into art-of finding it anywhere and everywhere in a green revery of "creativity"- is absolutely foreign to Ayme's sense of color. He could equally reject Oldenberg's ethic -"I am for an art that tells you the time of day, or where such and such a street is" -since abstraction could care less about inflated importance ascribed to the images we recall from an "experience" transcribed from an act of perception in an unquestioned code of topography and time. And Ayme would no doubt pass by arts that thrive on strong doses of fetishism - for exam- ple, Lucas Samaras' boxes or needled chairs, strong works in their own right--to give credence to the artist's problematic relation with painting, with those rejecting and fon- dling the materials they put under varnish. No: Ayme evokes Malraux in order to strip art of its value as a form of translation or, in other words, of a process recuperating the natural world through the money or metaphor of mimesis. It would seem that the heritage of New York expressionism with obsessive repetition of form having no grounding in vir- tual analogies is close to the kind of painting that Ayme would have us see. In his way there can be no economy or easy transaction involved in viewing. Never serene, the act of viewing does not scatter and reconstruct forms from the world, nor does it move toward a conceptual purity to which, like a rhetorical schema, color would otherwise lead the eye. This is why the paradigme is undone by the paraph of its title, bleu jaune rouge. For if we think of the heading as either a grammatical structure or a self-enclosed model, it would of needs be white; broken into the primaries, it leads us into a paradoxical declen- sion of colors, into syntagms of blue-yellow-red that offer fragmentary entries onto the long stretches of murals. Rarely are the paradigms established in configurations that draw our eyes into the play of blocks of color. A swath of red may be soaked across the canvas up to its center, left again after a blank, and then begun once more on a margin; the yellow might follow in the same way after a gap of two or three centimeters, as might the blue, leaving here and there stripings of the primaries on an edge that washes into very finely shaded rectangles of browns and deep ochres that leave steep clefts of white, blue, yellow, green or whatever happens to combine in the paradigm. In the books the painter 60</page><page sequence="4">often affixes corresponding diagrams that retrace the course of the applications of paint. There colored arrows make for Matisse-like windows that give way to each other, cross over and stop on a minimal network - and never are contained in a surrounding rectangle, except in that of the plate tipped into the book -of black lines. Although he calls these entrees, they never lead us anywhere except in front of the resistance of a final work (whose subtlety of coloration would impress a Joseph Albers), and they invariably have no function as a platonic scheme or "daimon" of philosophy, as a grille scripting continuity between the irreconcilable differences among color and order or thought and reason. The final incertitude evinced in the repetitions of paradigms one after another makes Ayme's oeuvre, like Rothko's continual production of color fields or De Kooning's women, throw us into multiple and ever-simultaneous distinction of elementary fragments blended onto each other. Paradigme du bleu jaune rouge misleads. The title implores us to look at the begin- nings of the paintings when, on first impression anyway, the immense fields of green, matte olive, dark browns, siena drab and terra cotta rusts sparkle all along the ridges where mixes coagulate in the central squares and rectangles. Dissonant, the yellow, red and blue command none of the surface of the darker hues. The colors seem to be an over- whelming conceptual residue, a sheer liquid mass, a leftover of some painterly equation so great that whatever primaries had been set in proportion are now part of broader tonal relations. Seen in expressionism where the dialectic of painter and canvas produces dead works - we could adduce any number of painters who toss away canvas or writers forever heaving their manuscripts into the wastebasket -these colors would be more subtractive than cumulative; less overlaid than torn off and abstracted from the earth that produced them. With American artists of the fifties, natural colors were never dripped over the can- vas innocuously: they were remainders at the intersections of more elementary gestures of color-as for example, on lines where housepaint blended in an uncannily arborescent type of Kelly green, or where for an instant a field of brown on a Rothko would look like earth only because we have fallen victim of our own mimetic associations or because it is squinched next to a strip of magenta. Or the rust bristling on David Smith's ironworks was simply extraneous to the sculpture but necessarily part of it. Such would be the nature of things, the overbearing res of a world impinging on an art that cares little about its decay. Ayme's rich greens and browns seem likewise to bear on earthen colors that have nothing to do with any connection to a natural world in which they might be found. The aftereffect of earthen tones in both his work and that of the action painters has only to do with rusty hues that, because of origins in primaries, cannot be restituted in a natural schema of things. Thus the brown and green -like Rembrandt's backgrounds - do not soothe the eye. They are ultimately a product of a matteness, not an organicity. Yet the cycles of growth and decay they call forth are residual enough in our impressions to be, fortunately, repressed and led back to interstices of brighter colors. The paradigms have an American look by force of remaining unfinished. The model of completion, the cardinal, squarish aspect of the frame, is often written into the designs that spill over them. In one of the most astonishing pieces (on p. 105, also on the cover beneath the printed characters of the title, and copied again but placed at a ninety-degree angle to the right on paragraph 25 of the Musee Fabre catalogue - Montpellier: 13 November-31 December 1980, with an accompanying text by Jean-Francois Lyotard), a central square "begins" a swath of red staggered over yellow in turn striped over blue to the lower left, gives onto imperfect checkers of horizontally and vertically grained wash of brown and green in the center, and then opens in the upper section --at a fake vanishing point-onto a slice of white below one of red adjacent to blue edges. Only the bleed on the margins allows an entry or a syntagmatic reading to take place. In this paint- ing Ayme had placed a wide band of paper and masking tape around the work to simulate a classically apportioned frame. Almost contained, the four borders mark a blank strip defining one of the four right angles. it disappears below and on about a third of the course of the upper edge, only to set forth a general stoppage on all bordering sides that lets the patches of paint begin their entry both beyond and within its imaginary perimeters. They disappear again in white, squeeze and crackle forward, and then submerge in the browns and greens of the central tesselations they have precipitated. diacritics I winter 1981 61</page><page sequence="5">Thanks to the white strip about the blends of colors, we can read the painting either a I'europeenne, in reflecting on an infinity of color-field dispositions in a manner like Meyer Schapiro's dialectical viewing of Mondrian [in Modern Art, New York: Braziller, 1978] or Yve-Alain Bois' axionometrical reading of El Lisitzsky ["L'Arbre et le carre," in Critique, May 1978, since translated in Enclitic], in which the unfolding of meaning takes place along lines and edges whose colored relations correspond to their differences elsewhere in the field of the picture and the frame. The five principal strips of red would be seen in movement, imposing on the four borders since three, to the outside, are parallel and perpendicular to two thin strips both in and of the inner frame. From this standpoint the obvious squaring of reds would permit a finer reading of the blues and yellows -that are seemingly less striking--because their formal variations amass on the thin linearities. Or the painting could be read a I'americaine, in following what the eye ascertains to be scars left by the removal of tape and paper, where as if by chance the colors are left intact by the borders they exceeded, and where they blend when the coagulating pigment is turned onto another layer of color. Here the mistakes confer power upon the form that classical geometry cannot keep clean. Somewhat like the drips of expressionism, the paint lifted from the masking produces a lecture accident2e in which globules mix only when they face the white edges to the other side. Where one reading is feverish in concept- and this is where the diagrams of Ayme's paintings are most resonant-the other, no less powerful, is grounded in action and negativity. In both there is no mimetic residue nor any transfer onto the plane of an immense picture "taken" from the world. In most of the reproductions we unsuccessfully try to read the paintings as Ayme schematizes them. Clearly the diagrams provide no entry at all; they are separate painting-essays on the rela- tion of white to colored lines, to the chance of crossing and of perpendicular ricochets. Arrows are drawn all over each other, and they provide us with Ayme's signatures. The traits cut rhythms of color (cf. the drawing on a grid, on p. 63) about an axis of two black lines and a field of white. Overtures to what he calls, quoting Mallarme, "the transitions of a spectrum" [p. 65], they tell us even more precisely how, ultimately, all lines are embodi- ments of color. The sketch tells us how we have been trained to read nothing but black ink. Editions in colored inks and papers too often strike us as pretentious offbeats to the truth of black. The stake in Ayme's books maintains that we read at once in black and white with a co-extensive affinity for all the colors that single lines and graphemes can contain. In most of Paradigme we have the feeling that a disseminated line will be both broken and spectrally infinite. For if Newton's prism that scattered a line of light into primaries and their variants were shaped like the triangle of law itself, the rainbow of color would be variation exceeding its three-sided closure. This is how the black typography finds itself breaking into the illumination of the colored plates. In this respect no debate has been ever so banally perpetual as that of trait versus color. A topic in every American course on the history of French painting, the old Ruben- ist-Poussinist dilemma is only elegant and cartesian enough to think in a semester's time. When he furnishes linear and colored versions of the same project on adjacent pages of his books, Ayme almost parodies the two poles of the classical debate. He slyly reflects on the relation of the palette to black and white as the paradoxical enrichment of tonal rela- tions. Where the Poussinist sees black and white as the ultimate duplicity of painting beyond mimesis, the prime mechanism of an absent god in a flicker of brilliant darkness, the Rubenist loses figures in mixed relations by having bodies move back and forth in a mode that sinuously defines black and white beneath the impasto of applied oils. Here optical theories on color are of no help for viewing Ayme, for the painters who really define the Rubenism of the world are all masters of black and white. If we continue to read Ayme between American and European traditions, the disposi- tion of a colored scheme informing a canvas imbued with six or seven layers of liquids brings us directly back to Malraux's notion of rivalry. It was he who extolled colorists who drew. Rembrandt, Goya and Manet were the heroes of Saturne, L'lrreel and L'Intemporel because they dared to infuse black and white--the negation of representation--into opulent fields of color. Like Manet after them, both Rembrandt and Goya made lines always broken and rebegun, crosshatched and incised in every direction. With Malraux, Wolfflin's famous distinction of 'linear' and 'painterly' effects was conflated from within, 62</page><page sequence="6">albert ayme. jacques henric Clockwise, from above: Albert Ayme, in front of one of his color paintings; the cover of the book Paradigme du Bleu Jaune Rouge (Paris: Martine Saillard, Edition Traversiere, 1979); Ayme, "Hommage a Malevitch," white monochromatic reliefs; Albert Ayme in front of his work, "Le dialogue sans fin" (1962), unstretched hanging mural; Ayme, sequence no. 15 from the series Paradigme (1975), in black, gray and white. diacritics I winter 1981 63</page><page sequence="7">from both a combination of lines set in fragments among colors and brushed onto paint- ings to bring ultimate and urgent renderings of black and white into play with natural tones - Rembrandt's brown soup decor of the 1660's - or garishly matte surfaces of artifi- cial hues - Goya's decorous reds or Manet's pink blotches in 'Olympia.' The blacks and whites underscored the unnameable essence of painting in marking the way its opposition fans out or alluviates, as it were, in a spectrum of color. Malraux's preoccupation with the literally unknown infinity of the blacks and whites of line is equally that of the American expressionist. Somehow Rothko's black rectangles bordered by white strips of the late 1960's bring out the best of the earlier work in mauve, burgundy and yellow; they even give the work an uncanny power that the range of pig- ments could bring to division in the center of the large canvasses before 1966. Or Franz Kline's blacks and whites of the late 1950's -"Wanamaker Block," "Accent Grave" or the drawings on pages of the Manhattan telephone directory -certainly jolt us much more than the later paintings that juxtapose squares of color. And De Kooning's most finished pieces of the mid-1950's are strafed with a black line-here and there-and white patches where the represented fragments of objects and bodies do not join. Because of the same reductive iridescence, these artists are no less Malrucian rivals of the world than the superstars of Baudelaire's phares. They correspond with immense problems of color that the European tradition had kept at the forefront of its work for over three or four cen- turies. Ayme's artful play of reduction and extension of color plays along the same line wherever the fields of pigment affront their schematic paradigm or, moreover, where the black and white of photographic plates and the rectangles of typography background the colored reproductions. As he added in a manuscript note in Paradigme, Ayme sees his work being "articulated on the notion of difference and covering the whole keyboard of tonal and chromatic values (from black to white, but without having to 'negotiate' the mix- ture of color by means of exclusively superimposing the three primaries" [p. 64]. To repeat, there remains a strong theory of color taking place all over the murals and even on the disposition of text and plate in the printed text, but nowhere better -at least between the two continents--than in a fragment of a 1978 mural (1m80 x 1m40) cut vertically in homage to Barnett Newman [pp. 84-85]. Newman would appear to be the ultimate analogue to Ayme. An "all-American intel- lectual" painter as Thomas Hess called him, Newman reconceived the frame and line with material urgency. He was going to "bust capitalism" with vertical 'zip' paintings, "'move away from the wall, destroy it ... make a painting hostile to the environment' " [quoted by Hess in his Barnett Newman (New York: Walker, 1968), p. 70] in the massively material handling of every aspect of the craft. No place for mysticism or melancholy in a field of red cut across by a strip of blue and yellow on a painting bearing a graphically over- charged title such as, for example, "Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue II1" (1966-67, 96x214 inches, in front of which poses Newman in a black suit in a photo on pp. 46-47 of Hess' study). Ayme quotes the title in Paradigme and tips into the page below it his own red mural that places a blue-then violet-zip right off center and two brown rectangles to the left. Malraux would never have allowed an American name to enter into his books of art; but here Ayme and Newman join with Malraux more than nominally. If we behold the memory of Newman's painting as cited within Ayme's primaries in Paradigme, "Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue III" acquires its theoretical density first as a praise of the three basic colors, black and white that are all keynote to good painting, and then equally as a defiance of an ethic of mimesis. By this is implied that the maudlin dramatics and boring psychodrama of Edward Albee's play are obliterated first through parody and through the pure triumph of color. Further down the line, the Newman-Ayme correspon- dence suggests that what would have been a theoretical beginning of all painting or writing - the linear bar of castration- that both stops and starts all art-work in a Freudian sense - is inconsequential. What matters is the deployment of color and perpetual painting irrespective of forms and shapes felt to be unattainable. All the platonics of art fall into the wash and soak of canvas. Of course Newman infused the energy of color everywhere, even to the graphics of his signature. Numen, new man were a part of the straight zips or bars he painted down the canvas. They were the logic of the mark of his name that stood up like the versions I, 64</page><page sequence="8">II, III of each of his titles (Onement, I or "one meant I"; Tundra or "T" under the shadow of "a"; The End of Silence or "The(e) N(d) of Silence," etc. - all of a graphic play varied as the materiality of Duchamp's and Derrida's poetics). Now Ayme erects a piece of canvas [p. 85] that "resembles" Newman's I. The field of white borders a central strip of yellow in turn abutted by slivers of blue, red, green, brown and orange before giving onto a greater damier of siena-browns. Framed as an I of three i's that move outward laterally, the center visibly dissolves Newman's capital letter as a zip of color. An I in the text, set to the extreme right of a double page, the plate avers to be a Newman-like bar laid over the col- umns of Jacques Henric's prose. It has less to do with Henric's words than with the binding of the two painters' signatures. Reproducing Newman's structure on its own field of always proportionately applied colors, the vertical fragment on p. 84 gives way, with a turn of the page, to the horizontal swath of a red paradigm on p. 85. No fear of either primaries or oedipal scenarios here: the move from one view to another allows him to con- geal his color in a title born only of proportion, in "1978 Drap mural sans chassis lm80xlm40," the metric M being a figure of infinite malleability--and of two artists' amitie- in which change of aspect ratio allows paintings to bleed out of each others' colors. Ayme becomes m x m- in an infinite serial extension one with the combinative possibility of the ratio, variation and mixture of color. Paradigme du bleu jaune rouge is the tenth of a collection of elegantly composed books. The first, Itineraire plastique (1963), was prefaced by some remarks of Ponge he scripts back into the variations of Paradigme of 1975 on p. 58: "'Subversion of the law: the law pushed to its ultimate consequence with the greatest rigor opens onto objective fervor [le delire objectif]-la verite jouit.'" Varying combinations of images and columns of text bear out the poet's aphorism, for each book is a consummately crafted object in which the images continually supersede, underline or bleed the texts. The imbalance derives from a certain play of chance by which the placement of colored prints tipped into the book makes the prose secondary on some occasions, gratuitous on others, in certain moments even crucial. Very few books are strong enough to loosen hold of their illustrations, to let them float or do what they will irrespective of a caption or adjacent text that controls, slows down or incorporates the image. Not so here. Paradigme demonstrates that the book of pure writing, a book without illustration, is chimerical even to think. And all the better that a book without images would be impossibly banal, for combinations make for supremely decisive acts of reading and seeing, of seizure and of movement, of our appre- hending blocks of prose as visual paradigms that we cut and recast even in minimal units small as point size, font, pica-length, gutter-width or m-spacings. The pictures offer a dif- ficult entree into the prose as partis pris des choses, as objects and colors whose syntac- tical play, graphematic disposition and visual aspect force meaning held in grammar more often than not to be of secondary concern. This is at least what emerges from Paradigme [Paris: Editions Carmen Martinez, 1976]. Entire page-plates of variations on black, white and grey paper- like distortions of Albers' Homage to the Square- constitute thirty or so page-frames, while Jean Ricardou's accom- panying essay on laws of recurrence and combination literally explicate the photographs and the binding of the book. Printed on thick grey paper--reminiscent of cardboard squares that pack laundered shirts -with variation on black and white inks which change with the shifts in concept, the prose operates in a fashion graphically identical to Ayme's sequences (in his words, 64 in all, "each bearing eight different combinations, which is to say 512 basic possibilities prior to any intervention on my part," the point being taken up again in Paradigme du bleu jaune rouge, p. 58). Pictures become characters and vice-versa. By having text and image combine according to the same equations that square grey, white and black shapes, an infinity of possibilities of reading is caught in a glance. Dissemination is performed in the collective work of the writer (Ricardou), painter (Ayme) and layout artist (Martine Saillard). But we must recall that the objectal shape of the book insulates the reading from any mystification beyond tactility and sight; word and image never lead to an analogical infinite, nor do they disappear before a compositional rule that generates them. Half of the pleasure, then, in reading Paradigme is in riffling the pages. A cinematic essay of typographical variation--black on white on grey--cuts across the squares in such a way that the most deliberate reading avers to be the most flippant one. diacritics I winter 1981 65</page><page sequence="9">(This is not new: we recall that we have to page quickly through Malraux's artbooks in order for the structuring of distantly intimate images to flash together on the retina. Even a text like Derrida's La Carte postale spaces itself according to gaps of 52 picas per carte, in a play of limitless variation on closure, whether of a doubled alphabet or a stack of playing cards.) The prose slows down the reading and remains the aftereffect of the visible prise or photographic take of the text. If we project the text-image relation elsewhere, how free is the combination from what we are told we see in, for example, a recent American postage stamp of 15? that ostensibly heralded abstract art. Many enthusiasts of stamps and letters sent correspondence pasted in the upper corner with one of Alber's variations of orange squares that carried the caption, "Learning Never Ends." Learning what never ends? Learn- ing the truth of color-field painting? Learning how to appreciate art that refuses mimesis? Hardly. Rather, that learning is yet another title or homage to the square. American anti- intellectualism prevailed in the very colors so many intellectuals sent to adorn the black prose of the letters. Back to orchestrations of text and image: Martine Saillard complicates the issues in the way she composes Paradigme du bleu jaune rouge. She cuts Jacques Henric's essay into blocks that rarely dominate the illustrations as would most books. Leaving ample margin for commentary by Ayme in printed writing--in offset, made from photographic halftones of his notes glued on boards that are photographed into negatives before a final plate is set-she allows a dialogue of prose and typography to take place. Although this reader finds Henric's essay self-indulgently anthropomorphic and prophetic in the most classical manner of recent work from Tel Quel, as he turns the strips into bodies of sanc- timonious presage ("these blues yellows reds hard of radish we carry in ourselves, in the center of our throats, like one glottis too many. We talk around or we gasp in its leaves. That's the cry of man," p. 12), of voice and larynx, Ayme's remarks in autograph tend to move the eye back to the colors and the plates. Many are written in fresh ink; they deal with painting and the questions of placement, not with a nostalgic politics of aging com- munists of 1968 vintage. Hence each copy of the book is not only unique but another variation. At times Ayme responds to Henric and forms a recognizable dialogue, at others he goes his own ways, oblivious to any context we might deduce from the combinations of color and text. Whatever the vector of the dialogue between writer and painter, Ayme and Henric come close to the best possible combinations of different media. Novels and essays that are composed aspectually have been legion in the last two decades: long descriptions of absent paintings are a core of the nouveau roman, Robbe-Grillet writing algorithms according to Jasper Johns' number-paintings, George Segal releasing letters that allow Michel Butor to take words out of painting, scissored pieces of post cards from American museums structuring much of Ricardou's prose, Rauschenberg's New York becoming a decor for Simon's intricate weave of images. As in many texts that literally smell of acrylic mix or acetone and seem to be written with templates and spray-guns, Paradigme du bleu jaune rouge owes its power to the placement of text and picture in supreme evidence. Nothing is hidden; no shadow allows for an enigma to be sought through the gloss. Much of the success must be due to Martine Saillard's careful editing, for the layout tells us that the choice of font and spacing, the cutting of the pictures, their framing and orchestration, all is done to release the reader from the imposing bind of either a dominant word or a commanding, individual image. The consequence of a multiply conceived book is great for many readers of Diacritics, in which the impress of Derrida's return to the letter-detached from the voice-of meaning has been made better than anywhere in the USA. Most are no doubt familiar with the essay regrouped from articles on painting under the title La Verite en peinture [Paris: Flammarion, 1978]. The book is a great meditation on the impossibility of either abstracting, "illustrating," or "signing" either a thought or a picture. It gauges verite as a plastic, proportional metaphoricity, a degree-of-metaphor or truth (v&amp;r-ite, grafting the ver of "le vert est ou" to the suffix ite), a toward-icity, that comes through the appearance of both abstract structures and a world in an image, in a truth-in-painting that is loathesomely hilarious ("je ne peux pas le voir en peinture," as epithets go). This is what Cezanne promised to deliver in a letter (to Emile Bernard) that Derrida happily misattrib- 66</page><page sequence="10">utes to Emile Male. "Cezanne had promised to pay his debts: I OWE YOU THE TRUTH IN PAINTING? AND I WILL TELL IT TO YOU" (to Emile Male, 23 October 1905). "A strange statement. He who speaks is a painter. He speaks, or rather he writes, it is a letter and this 'joke' is written much more easily than spoken." [in La V6rite en peinture (Paris: Flammarion, 1978), pp. 6-7]. It is as if Bernard were a Male and a Maler, a painter and a "repeater," as well as a recurrent originator of things in the metaphysical cast of an ordinary mal of being malerisch, a male, or a piece of correspondence bearing a 1i or 151 postage stamp that signs the painting of the letter. Derrida moves the color, variation and sheer pleasure of painting to the malefic power of the letter. As the book develops, it betrays a taste for thoroughly linear art. Valerio Adami is heralded as a consummately graphic artist, shown by the fact that the drawings of "+ r (par dessus le marche)" cannot really support color, and that in expositions elsewhere, the paintings lose their force when seen in color. Or Derrida's dialogue with Gerard Titus-Carmel's "Pocket Size Tlinget Coffin et les 61 premiers dessins qui s'ensuivirent" extols a bier through a psychoanalytical perspective confused with Abraham's notion of the crypt only insofar as the lines speciously define a volume in constantly reiterated variation. Fetish wins over color. As in the case of Derrida's and Adami's book-picture-text that formed a special issue of Derriere le miroir, "Cartouches" works only in terms of trace, and almost to the point of excluding pigment. Albert Ayme's work provides a fabulous contrast, for the Paradigme operates accord- ing, as we have noted, to broken and rewritten lines, but only with ever-changing pro- ductions of paint. Reduction to the trace involves expansion onto problems that defy cal- culation as soon as they are equated as primaries. This is what the browns, greens and yellow-oranges of the Paradigme bring to a conceptual tradition of painting. As in Newman's work, colors overpower ideas; they vary them in every direction, which throws us back to the bearing of Rubens and Poussin, but now under a different-and more intensely fluorescent--light: it may be that color is precisely what cannot be philoso- phized; like writing, it can only be performed, essayed, mixed, gesticulated, soaked, rolled, and drawn over canvas, over again.
