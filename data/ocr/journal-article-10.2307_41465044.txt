<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews The Great Ape Project: Equality beyond Humanity , edited by Paola Cav- alieri and Peter Singer. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1993. 312 pp. $21.95 (cloth). Given that it is reasonably broadly agreed that it is bad to torture or kill apes, the fascinating premise of this book is that the proposition actually requires scientific justification. Thus we have here one of the most in- teresting cultural texts I have encountered in quite some time. As a book about science, specifically its cultural use as an ideological validation mechanism, the tome is a masterpiece; courses on the anthropology of science will be able to milk this for years. As a book of science, on the other hand, it is of regrettably little value. Let us begin with a multiple choice question. Essay 21 of this col- lection starts as follows: "Chimpanzees make love rather like humans do." How can we explain such a statement? (1) The author has confused chimpanzees with Klingons. (2) The author's cable company switched the Discovery Channel with the Playboy Channel. (3) The author is in rather dire need of therapy. (4) Accuracy is irrelevant in the context of political advocacy, and once again we find that science is merely the handmaiden of politics. Certainly there is a problem that has not yet been effectively addressed. Apes are threatened in the wild by the economic development of the human societies around them. Part of this threat is their exportation, legal and illegal. Apes are often objectified by callous and cynical entrepre- neurs, who neither regard them nor treat them as the sentient, emotion- ally complex creatures that they are. They are generally disposed of when they lose their cuteness, usually less than one-fifth of the way through their lives. The lucky ones can live out their lives in the care of an enlightened or sympathetic zoo or primate research facility with sensitive caretakers and handlers. Most, of course, are not lucky. We are presented here with a three-pronged proposal: that great apes are entitled to life, liberty, and exemption from torture - in other words, to the rights of humans, with whom they form "a community of equals." In The Great Ape Project are 31 essays by academic scholars attempting to prove why this is indeed so. And we know we're in trouble when essay 1 tells us that chimps deserve human rights because they are our closest relatives, essay 2 tells us that gorillas deserve human rights because they are our closest relatives, and essay 5 tells us that orangutans deserve human rights because at least Jeff Schwartz (who is not the au- thor of the essay) says they are our closest relatives.</page><page sequence="2">1114/ Book Reviews So the Scientific Argument from Most Proximate Phylogeny falls quickly under the weight of its internal contradictions. They are all close relatives. So are the hylobatids, who are arbitrarily excluded. Science certainly provides no validation for that cutoff; and oddly enough, when the proposition of great ape rights was put forth in the New Scientist last year, it was illustrated with a siamang, though disenfranchised by the very text it accompanied! There is a philosophical Pandora's box opened by the arbitrary lim- its of the "Great Ape Project." Why should great apes deserve human rights because they are closely related to us and lesser apes not, just because they are more distantly related? Why should genetic distance be a key to the allocation of rights? By that reasoning, Europeans should accord fewer rights to Japanese than to Pakistanis. Ultimately, the prop- ositions are arbitrary and the scientific arguments weightless, although possibly useful. Kortlandt, in essay 13, at least tells us that a "real chasm" separates the great apes from the gibbons and baboons. He does not tell us what establishes that chasm. The editors acknowledge this and allow the more radical proposition of human rights for all animals to peer through the text at various intervals: Presumably this would entail the mass eman- cipation of pets and abolition of carnivorousness. But they are careful to keep the focus on our closest relatives. The first essay is from the book's heavy hitter, Jane Goodall, whose own contributions to the field of primatology can hardly be overstated, except perhaps next to her contributions to the field of primatography. Goodall is an unabashed anthropomorphism In fact, she can be legiti- mately credited with having made it respectable in the ethological lit- erature, and her contribution here principally lies in presenting anecdotes of how darn nice chimps are, especially Spindle, Old Man, and Auntie Gigi. Alas, if this is the justification for treating the species well, I shud- der to think how to judge the species on the basis of those two psycho- apes, Passion and Pom. And therein lies the problem. The point is certainly right: Apes deserve humane treatment. But the scientific proof of it is elusive. In fact, to my mind, the argument put forth here - that not simply do apes deserve humane treatment, but they deserve human treatment - is largely undermined by the scientific evidence. The problem with that proposition is biologically fundamental. They just aren't human. That problem is sidestepped, however, by repeating the mantra that the apes are nearly human. This is expressed most eloquently by Richard Dawkins in essay 7, who tells us that We Are Apes. Of course this is not original with Dawkins; he is merely taking to heart the great over- statement of molecular anthropology, first expressed by the chemist Em- ile Zuckerkandl in 1962. Genetically, we are apes. Therefore we are</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews / 1 1 15 apes. Never mind that anatomically, ecologically, demographically, be- haviorally, and mentally we are easily different from apes. To Dawkins we are genetically apes, and that is all that matters. It is certainly an interesting cultural statement, reductionist and hereditarian, but it seems hardly to encompass the general biology of the Hominoidea. The science behind Dawkins' s revelation is simply the nature of paraphyletic taxa. By the same criteria that humans are apes, dogs are fish and pigeons are reptiles. This is a simple consequence of the para- phyletic nature of the categories "fish" and "reptiles." It is not a fun- damental revelation about the natures of humans, dogs, and pigeons; it is merely casting a blind eye to the emergence of uniquely derived fea- tures, in technical parlance, autopomorphies. Jared Diamond, in essay 8, offers a summary of the most con- vincing genetic data showing that we are apes. For Diamond, however, time apparently stands still, for the evidence he brings to bear is the Sibley- Ahlquist work on DNA hybridization. (Don't worry, I won't get started on that. Just remember I could have.) Those precise numbers representing our genetic similarity to chimps get bandied around quite a bit. Essay 1 says we are 1% different from chimps; essay 3 places us "within 1 per cent"; essay 8 gives that value as 1.6%. Certainly this is a trivial datum, but is the precise quantitative assessment of our genomic similarity to chimps really valid? Our pro- teins are over 99% identical, but protein-coding DNA is a minuscule portion of the genome. Best as I can tell, DNA hybridization gives us a figure of about 2% difference, but that is only using the least redundant half of the genome. For the entire genome we do not really have a num- ber; nobody has ever measured it - which is not to say that I would expect it to be more than, say, 3%, ignoring the measurement that the chimpanzee genome is also 10% larger than the human genome. Sure, we are similar genetically to the chimpanzee, but the use of a number with a decimal point gives the impression of underlying scientific pre- cision that is actually not present. The point is merely that, again, the science itself is dubious here; it is the use of scientific terms and factoids that makes this interesting. In essay 10 we get a different scientific argument about the near- humanness of apes. We learn that species are not real, merely clusters of organisms. In the next essay we get the opposite view, with which most practicing systematic biologists would agree - that species are in- deed real and are themselves spatiotemporally bounded individuals. That, of course, helps us to extend human rights in a (biologically) nonarbi- trary way. The species boundary is, however, subsequently blurred in several chapters by discussions of the behavioral and mental capacities of apes, which occurs consistently in a (pre-Darwinian) developmentalist frame-</page><page sequence="4">1116/ Book Reviews work. A chimp is like a retarded child. A chimp is another species. We are given the conclusion that chimps should consequently be treated like retarded children, but somehow not that retarded children are like an- other species. One of the pervasive underlying themes is that a chimpanzee is a homunculus, an undeveloped subhuman. But a chimpanzee is a non- human, not a subhuman. If we do not get that straight, the chances of bringing scientific arguments into effective play are small. But it is not, apparently, in the editors' interests to note the ways in which apes are different from humans: how they live, communicate, interact with their environment, eat, mate, and move - basically everything. The apes here seem to have assumed the symbolic role of "the primitive": the pristine innocents, nature without culture, an image we are no longer able to impose on other people. When we encounter an explicit thought such as "how far down the phylogenetic ladder," we can attribute consciousness to others (essay 18) - we can appreciate the fundamentally Victorian concepts embedded in the enterprise. In addition to the absence of a coherent underpinning of mainstream science, The Great Ape Project also presents us with wildly diverse agendas on the parts of the contributors. Some want to stop scientists from im- porting great apes from the wild for their research. (News Flash! They've already stopped!) Some want to stop all biomedical research on apes, invasive or otherwise; some want to release all apes now in captivity back into the wild. "All royalties earned from this book," the editors tell us, "will go to the cause of returning chimpanzees, gorillas, and orang- utans to an environment that accords with their physical, mental and, social needs." Anybody wonder just exactly what the editors think those needs are and what that environment is? The most ingenious paradox here is that the very evidence martialed to show us why apes should not be kept in captivity is itself derived from captive studies (essays 4, 5, and 6). Some contributors lament apes "imprisoned in zoos" and trained to amuse us. As of this writing, there are over a million Americans imprisoned in prisons; and between ath- letics and dramatics a lot of humans are trained quite rigorously to amuse us. Why is it therefore intrinsically wrong for apes? Are we permitted to distinguish between the treatment and the ma/treatment of apes in captivity or for entertainment? Alas, because we are presented promi- nently with captivity and training for entertainment per se as maltreat- ment, we cannot know. A common trope in several essays is the thought experiment, many of which were explored imaginatively decades ago by Rod Serling. The most bizarre of these occur in essay 12 and particularly in essay 14, in which the author gives "an idea for a screenplay." In the future, "time has not been kind to the human species," which is "sickly and neurotic,"</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews / 1 1 17 but "the apes have enjoyed a steady march forward." Try Rod Serling's treatment of Pierre Boulle's novel. I would venture that the imagery of Planet of the Apes probably did more for raising consciousnesses about the treatment of apes in captivity than all the scientific factoids brought to bear in this volume. The tragedy is that illustrative examples of mistreatment on the part of scientists are given without regard to era, and several authors directly imply that conditions and attitudes that existed decades ago are still in place and are normative. The Nazis are invoked wildly, although none of the contributors acknowledge that the Nazis were avid about ani- mals - it was people they didn't like. Ultimately, the absence of a clear, unifying, reasonable agenda gives The Great Ape Project the feeling of simply flailing about. Modern read- ers, even creationists, need hardly be convinced of the sentience of the apes and the necessity of conserving them and dealing with them em- pathetically. But are there other moral imperatives to be traded off against this? Did the lives of New Guineans saved from kuru when it was shown to be the result of a new kind of infectious agent compensate for those of the chimps who succumbed in that demonstration? Beats me. Nobody brings that up. So ultimately, how seriously can this book be taken? Humanizing the apes serves a political goal - the book's main objective - but the sci- ence alongside it, ostensibly validating it, is decidedly thin. It reminds me of the American Eugenics Society, whose political agenda in the 1920s of protecting our nation's Western European germ-plasm was fo- cused around the activities and goals of such demagogues as Madison Grant and Lothrop Stoddard; yet the Society managed to recruit most mainstream geneticists to their cause and to serve alongside them. The price paid ultimately for the scientists' failings was a devaluation of the science itself. Empathetic treatment for apes? Self-evident. Human rights for apes? An idea born of decadence and misanthropy. Take it to Sarajevo, and explain it to them. JONATHAN MARKS Department of Anthropology Yale University New Haven, CT 06511</page></plain_text>
