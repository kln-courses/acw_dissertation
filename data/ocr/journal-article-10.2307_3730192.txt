<plain_text><page sequence="1">Eighteenth-century discussions revolve around two primary issues: learned versus intuitive responses to blackness, and absolute versus relative standards of physical beauty. In the course of the eighteenth century, Professor Gilman argues, 'racism gave way to the question of cultural relativism' and by the end of the century 'the anthropomorphism of darkness was completed and the Black stood as an individual, perceiving reality, rather than as the embodiment of a natural force'. The weakness of this kind of Geistesgeschichte, in the view of this reviewer, is its lack of a political dimension. In the light of the enormous proliferation of the slave trade during the same years which celebrated the spread of enlightened thinking, racism can hardly be described as having 'given way' to cultural relativism; different people subscribed to each view, and they continued to do so throughout the nineteenth century, as Gilman's quotations from Hegel, Nietzsche, and the colonial novel amply demonstrate. But on the whole the black continued to be presented as an emblem of barbarism: Herder's enlightened view that human nature has no hierarchy of colour lost out to Hegel's definition of the African black as 'the Unhistorical, Undeveloped Spirit, still involved in the conditions of mere nature'. Is the persistence of mythic stereotypes in relation to blacks peculiarly character- istic of Germany, or is it a shared feature of most European and American literature up to the twentieth century? Even in countries which offered more real contact with blacks, the existence of a stereotype often seems to have obscured actual perception of an uncomfortable reality. Stereotypes also travel fast: in the frontispiece Professor Gilman cleverly shows how a nineteenth-century American illustration for Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin took on a new life in Germany as an advertise- ment for Liebig's Meat Extract. Professor Gilman's concluding point is both controversial and pessimistic: whereas German consciousness is now beginning to respond to the new outsider image of the 'Gastarbeiter', the black, along with theJew, seems condemned to exist only in the world of myth. But there is more than one tradition in German thought, and those who look to Lessing as their model will continue to fight for education as a means of substituting history for myth. Moreover, as black writers articulate their own experience through writing, they enable us to hear an individual voice and to forget a blurred stereotype. It is only by such efforts that we can begin to close the gap between self-consciousness and the fear of otherness. M. KAY FLAVELL BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA La Legende de Tristan au Moyen Age. Edited by DANIELLE BUSCHINGER. (G6ppinger Arbeiten zur Germanistik, 355) G6ppingen: Kimmerle. I982. I9I pp. DM 28. It is always difficult to do justice to a collection of articles by different authors on different (if related) topics, since some of the contributions are bound to be devoted to matters outside the reviewer's normal sphere of interest, and no contributor likes to see his name left out or less space devoted to him than to another. But precisely this invidious task is mine in attempting to review the fourteen very wide-ranging articles that resulted from a colloquium on the Tristan legend in the Middle Ages organized by the Centre d'Etudes Medievales de l'Universite de Picardie held at Amiens on 6 and I7 January 1982. Two of the contributors are concerned to put the story of Tristan and Isolde back onto the map of Cornwall. Of these the more arresting is Andre de Mandach's 'Le Berceau des amours splendides de Tristan et Iseut' (pp. 7-33), which is so alluringly detailed that every medievalist must needs reach for his Ordnance Survey map and drive off into the sunset immediately. As he himself gratefully acknowledges, he is Reviews 97I</page><page sequence="2">building on the foundations laid by O.J. Padel of the University of Exeter's Institute of Cornish Studies, particularly on that author's 'Cornish Background of the Tristan Stories', which appeared in the first volume of Cambridge Medieval Celtic Studies (I98I). The other Celtic article in the present volume is by Padel himself, 'Les Elements celtiques' (pp. 81-87). Of the four articles on French Tristan versions, two are on the Folies (Rosanna Brusegan, 'La Folie de Tristan: de la loge de Morrois au palais de verre' (pp. 49-59), and Jean-Charles Payen, 'Tristan, l'amans-amens et le masque dans les Folies' (pp. 61-68)), and two are on Beroul (Jean Batany, 'Le Manuscrit de Beroul: un texte difficile et un univers qui nous derange' (pp. 35-48) and Jacques Ribard 'Quelques reflexions sur l'amour tristanien' (pp. 69-79)). I feel confident to speak only on the last two. With a disarming and refreshing frankness rare among scholars Professor Batany suggests that if those passages in MS BN 2171 that all editors have been at pains to emend were taken at their face value, the result would be a work- not without parallel, as his last sentence suggests - bearing witness to the existence of'un mouvement obscur, qui semble avoir tendu, au XIe et XIIe s., au developpe- ment d'une contre-culture, d'une sorte de culture "autre" que la culture clericale traditionelle, et qui se serait appuyee sur une pensee "sauvage" au sens non pejoratif que Levi-Strauss donne a ce terme' (p. 48). Why not indeed? Does all medieval literature have to be conformist and strait-laced? Less outspoken, but equally tormented by the great ambiguity that is the Tristan myth, are Professor Ribard's reflections on the nature of the love portrayed therein, which is passionate, predestined, and mortiferous, and thus out of line with courtly love. No fewer than six of the papers in this volume are devoted more or less entirely to Gottfried's Tristan. Two are devoted solely to that work, while two others are comparative. Jean Fourquet provides a magisterially brief (pp. Io9-12), though wholly speculative hypothesis that the much-discussed wintschaffene Christ is Gott- fried's final riposte in his alleged duel of words with Wolfram: if Wolfram's great work can achieve a happy denouement by virtue ofa petitio principii (Parzival is allpwed to fulfil his destiny despite the apparent premise that renders this impossible), why then, Gottfried too can make Christ into a weathercock. Not heresy, in other words, but an authorial quid pro quo. Unprovable, yes, but by the same token irrefutable. Jean-Marc Pastre pays homage to Gottfried's style ('La Venuste du style de Gottfried de Strasbourg' (pp. 131-38)) with a detailed study of the rhetorical devices in lines 17347-93. The two comparative ones are Xenja von Ertzdorff's 'L'Amour parfait des amants et les conflits de morale: Gottfried von Strassburg et Thomas de Bretagne' (pp. II3-I9) and Danielle Buschinger's 'Gottfried von Strassburg, adaptateur de Thomas de Bretagne' (pp. 167-91). This latter contribu- tion, to the Germanist's mind the most substantial in the volume, continues a line of enquiry already known to us from the pen of this Tristan scholar and compares two passages from Gottfried's poem, lines 18443-54 and lines I5765-I6402 (Petitcriu) with the corresponding passages in the Tristramssaga (as a substitute for Thomas) to show how skilfully Gottfried adapts his source. It will be interesting to see whether her interpretation of the shorter of these two passages will find general acceptance: 'Gottfried part du texte de son modele ou il etait question d'un sejour de Tristan chez l'empereur de Rome pour faire une allusion directe aux troubles accompagnant en Allemagne le schisme imperial provoque par la double election royale en I 98 de Philippe de Souabe et d'Otton IV de Brunswick, et peut-etre meme pour exprimer son opinion personnelle' (p. I89). To me at least it seems very persuasive. The last two Gottfried contributions are very hard for me to appraise, though, like Professor Batany's article referred to earlier, they show that Gallic versatility and freshness that makes them a joy to read. I refer to Daniel Rocher's 'Denis de Rougemont, la "legende" de Tristan et le roman de Gottfried de Strassburg' (pp. I39-50) and Reviews 972</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 973 Michel Huby's 'Dans quel esprit Gottfried travaillait-il?' (pp. 151-65). Professor Rocher brilliantly dismantles Denis de Rougement's LAmour et l'Occident and then unaccountably uses it as a peg on which to hang an interpretation of Gottfried's poem - rather as if, having read both, he wanted at all costs to bring them together. Professor Huby urges prudence on 'ceux qui font du poete allemand un grand penseur, un philosophe, voire un theologien ou un mystique' (p. 159), though even his wit fails to convince me that Isolt's amazement on realizing that Tantris and Tristan are one and the same person is proof of her low intellectual faculties. Two articles remain to be mentioned, one on the Middle English Sir Tristram (Andre Crepin, 'Position de "Sir Tristram"' (pp. 89-Io8)), which my ignorance of the Middle English poem forbids me to discuss, and one on the two musical works inspired by the Tristan story, Wagner's opera and Frank Martin's oratorio (Ulrich Miiller, 'Le Debat sur "Tristan": l'oratorio de Frank Martin, Wagner et Bedier' (pp. 121-29)), in which the author shows how Bedier's reconstruction, which Martin used as the text for his oratorio, had in one vital respect not been able to free itself entirely from the influence of Wagner. It is many decades since I heard Frank Martin's oratorio (no doubt it was a broadcast of the Salzburg performance referred to by Professor Muller at the end of his paper), and I should have liked to be told more about it. I note with satisfaction that we are promised a longer version, which has no doubt already appeared, I hope in German, since the translation here presented fails occasionally to live up to the standard of elegance and style maintained by most contributions to this - tojudge by the volume in hand - most productive and stimulating Tristan colloquium. To end on a carping note, there are rather more mistakes in this book than tolerance might be expected to allow. I will not bore the reader with a list of errors, restricting myself rather to pointing out first, that in the list of contents Oliver Padel becomes Olivier Padel, and Professor Crepin's contribu- tion is given a different title from that under which it ultimately appears; secondly, that the Institute of Cornish Studies of the University of Exeter, though mentioned only twice (pp. 8 and 8I), is misspelt both times, and that variously; thirdly, that Professor Reid's initials are T.B.W. (p. 14); fourthly, that verse 3535 of Eilhard cannot possibly correspond to verse 4235 of Gottfried, as we are told on page I6, since the 'Belauschtes Stelldichein' does not begin until verse I4587; fifthly, that 'Thomas' on page 83, line 17, should surely read 'Tristan'; and sixthly, that a number of omissions and/or errors make the text occasionally hard to follow (p. 77, eighth line from bottom; p. I 15, eighteenth line from bottom; p. I69, 1. 3; p. 179, 1. 7; p. I84,1. 21) and on two occasions incomprehensible (p. 36,1. 2, and p. 184, 1. 2). UNIVERSITY OF BRISTOL FRANK SHAW The Medieval German Lyric 1150-1300. The Development of its Themes and Forms in their European Context. By OLIVE SAYCE. Oxford: Oxford University Press. I982. xviii + 511 pp. ?35.00. Olive Sayce's long-awaited book will be warmly welcomed, and by a readership beyond specialists in the medieval German lyric. Her Introduction (Chapter I) is a clear and comprehensive outline of the subject. She lists the manuscript collections by which the scope of her study is largely defined, and summarizes the editorial procedures which have been applied to them, indicating and justifying her own preference for the 'classical', pre-Kraus editions of Minnesangs Frihling. She sketches out the geographical and social background of the relevant poets and their literary context, and surveys the different types of poem, their language, imagery, and metre. Chapter 2 is an extremely informative account of the contents, composition, and interrelations of the manuscripts, including their illustrations and musical notation.
