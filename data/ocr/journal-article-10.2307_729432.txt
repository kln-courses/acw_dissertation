<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS OF BOOKS chapter in which he states his own view of the most fundamental problem of modern music-that of tonality. After reading this no one could maintain that Furtwangler's adherence to the classics was the product of unimaginative conservatism. He rejects atonality for much the same technical reasons as does Hindemith; because music is an art which depends on tension and relaxation in time, and without tonality tension and relaxation are not apprehensible. (" We cannot escape from the conclusion that a type of music which dispenses with a device to regulate tension and relaxation . . . must be considered as biologically inferior ".) At the same time, when Furtwangler goes on to give his philosophical account of the reasons for the growth of atonality he gives credit to its integrity and creative force. Tonality, for him, corresponds to the anthropomorphic, Ptolemaic-Christian view of the world; and the laws of tonality are biological, not physical facts, whereby each note " is referred to the whole range of human emotion, and man as listener is unreservedly made the centre of the whole ". Atonality, for him, represents the ultimate triumph of the Copernican view " which con- siders man as nothing more than a speck of dust within a huge universe which is beyond the scope of human measurements and concepts ". For Furtwangler the masterpieces of tonal music are the " last and sweet- est flower of the creative cultural genius of Europe ". Nonetheless he can understand how the two tendencies can co-exist in the world today; for the human spirit " would fain exchange the narrow garden of what is merely human (tonality) for the dread liberty of cosmic space, although it feels that it is thus endangering its biological organic nature ". This attitude to atonality may of course be questioned; but it is a serious approach. At least it is encouraging to find a musician who hopes for the survival of humanity, while not being scared of atomization. W. M. Mendelssohn. By Philip Radcliffe. pp. 208. (London: Dent. 'The Master Musicians ' Series. I954. 8s. 6d.) Mendelssohn was of all the composers of his generation the most prominent public figure. His life was packed with musical and social incident in several countries, and more than a few of his many friends were moved to record their impressions of him. Moreover he was an indefatigable letter-writer himself; a large number of the letters have been preserved, and rank amongst the most vivid ever to have come from a musician's pen. His biographers, therefore, are uncommonly fortunate in the amount of material available to them, though the task of com- pressing it all into a volume of the modest size of the ' Master Musicians ' series is no enviable one. By rigidly keeping his eyes front, and by means of admirably clear, succinct prose, Philip Radcliffe (in his replacement of an earlier volume by S. Stephen Stratton) has succeeded in presenting all the salient, out- ward features of the life in sixty pages, which is even less than is customary in this series. His information is trustworthy, save for a few trivial errors such as 1839 instead of 1838 for the birth of Mendelssohn's first child and the attribution of an Oxford professorship to Mendelssohn's grandson. Moreover he deserves gratitude for making it very clear that besides Vol. XXXV S I5I</page><page sequence="2">MUSIC AND LETTERS being the equable drawing-room charmer of popular imagination, Mendelssohn had also far more of the spoilt child's dislike of criticism and intolerance of obstacles in his highly-strung make-up than biographers have hitherto liked to admit. But it cannot be said that a living figure emerges from this biographical section of the book, largely because Mr. Radcliffe, in the interests of economy, has often paraphrased the com- poser's letters instead of allowing them to introduce their own incandes- cence into his somewhat dry, factual text. Nor has he made enough use of the letters as a means of throwing light on Mendelssohn's innermost thoughts and feelings about life's larger philosophical, religious, aesthetic and artistic issues, as opposed to mere day-to-day matters of business, with the result that though we make the composer's acquaintanceship we never see into the secret places of his heart as might a close friend. Mr. Radcliffe has also denied himself the pleasure of trying to re-create the general musical atmosphere of the several important cities-notably Leipzig-where Mendelssohn was uncrowned king, and likewise of sketching portraits of his friends. What a chance he wasted, too, in not including one of Mendelssohn's own paintings or sketches (too cursorily dismissed, like all the composer's hobbies, in the text) amongst the book's several illustrations! The second half of the book dealing with the music is a praiseworthy example offairplay. Since the qualitieswhich endeared Mendelssohn to our forebears are so strikingly out of tune with the mood of to-day, it was hardly to be expected that he would emerge from these pages as the irreproachable genius many nineteenth-century English critics would have had their world believe him. Mr. Radcliffe is never guilty of applying a blind eye to the telescope, yet just because some of the ' Songs without Words ', for example, are " bathed in an atmosphere of good-tempered sabbatical placidity" he does not brush the lot aside with the intolerance characteristic of so much critical opinion to-day. Hailing from academic circles, where truth, so we like to believe, is pursued objectively, he takes endless trouble to discriminate between the gold and the dross in Mendelssohn's prolific output, and he has a neat gift for finding the happy epithet in his descriptions of each piece. A wide general knowledge of music enables him to point to influences at work in this or that, and several interesting observations are dropped in the course of his evaluations, such as the power of the key of F# minor to stimulate Mendelssohn to an unusually high level of intensity, or why it was that Mendelssohn was unlikely to have made a good operatic composer. But again, in this part of the book, Mr. Radcliffe does not tell us enough or come to sufficiently significant stylistic conclusions. We should like to know more about the orchestration than is contained in the words " clear, economical and sometimes surprisingly imaginative ". We should like to know more about the composer's poetic predilections, and whether musical or poetic considerations conditioned the form of his songs. We should like to know whether the harmonic, rhythmic and melodic traits noted in the last chapter remained constant throughout his life, or showed any development with the passing of the years. In particular, Mr. Radcliffe seems to have shirked the task of trying to " place " Mendelssohn in the changing musical scene of mid-nineteenth century Europe, when qualities such as romanticism and nationalism were I52</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS OF BOOKS for the first time being consciously labelled and thrown up in antithesis to classicism, and when " programme " elements in music were breaking through the framework of traditional form. Where did Mendelssohn stand in all this? An extraordinarily interesting letter about music and its meaning written from Genoa in 1831 would have given Mr. Radcliffe an excellent starting-off point for this important enquiry. The composer's abilities as pianist, organist and conductor are perhaps matters of no great consequence nowadays; nevertheless here again Mr. Radcliffe has not attempted to explain what there was about Mendels- sohn's conducting that led to an invitation to take on the Lower Rhine Festival at Diisseldorf at the age of twenty-four, nor has he made any mention of Mendelssohn's provocative introduction of the baton to the Leipzig Gewandhaus concerts. In short, this book is good in so far as it goes, but it does not go quite far enough. Perhaps Mr. Radcliffe can now be persuaded to write another Mendelssohn volume twice or three times as long. 1. O. C. The History of Music in Sound. Vol. IV. The Age of Humanism, ed. J. A. Westrup; handbook by Gerald Abraham. pp. 72. (Oxford Univer- sity Press. Ios. 6d.) Gramophone records issued by H.M.V. Anyone who has tried to give a comprehensive series of lectures on the history of music will know the difficulties presented by the lack of illustra- tions at his disposal. This has been especially evident when sixteenth and seventeenth century music has been the subject and, although the recent advent of long-playing records has relieved the trouble to some degree, unless a small fortune can be spent on these the difficulty remains. What has been lacking so far is a number of representative examples of the greatest music. Often only the trivialities have been accessible. In addition, those works which have been easily obtainable often existed only in miserably inadequate or unscholarly performances. The present project of the ' History of Music in Sound '-a series of albums of gramophone records together with handbooks including musical illustrations, designed to accompany the new Oxford History- has much in its favour and, although certain individual performances fail, on the whole it is a very important and worthy achievement. In the first place, as is shown well in the latest volume, the works chosen are important and give some idea of the scale of the best work of the period. The two Italian madrigals are both big works, and demonstrate two ideals of the most mature madrigal composers. Similarly two out of the four English madrigals are among the greatest that can be found, while the others are typical of the lighter style which was more general in England. Nor is the Roman school of church music assumed to be more important than any of the others and there are good examples of Philippe de Monte, Lassus and Victoria. Examples of the work of Giovanni Gabrieli and Praetorius show very well the development of church music in the early seventeenth century and make it clear that works of considerable splen- dour existed, in a style that will be new to many people. With both keyboard music and solo song there are similiar revelations, and the volume ends with a fine scene from Monteverdi's ' Orfeo '.
