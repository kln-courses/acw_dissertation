<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JACOB'S LADDER IN HOMER By Rurus TOWN STEPHENSON DePauw University Greencastle, Indiana In Genesis we read the beautiful story of Jacob's dream, and with Jacob we see the angels descending and ascending the rounds of that wonderful ladder which reached from heaven to earth; above it we glimpse God himself assuring Jacob of his watchful care. There are few who realize that we have that same Jacob's ladder in Homer's Iliad and Odyssey. Certainly one of the things to be most appreciated in Homer is his two-world point of view. To him earth was unthinkable without heaven, and heaven was unthink- able without earth. Their interrelation made the world he knew. It is most interesting to note that the Iliad opens with earth reaching up to heaven for co6peration-Achilles through Thetis to Zeus; it closes with heaven reaching down to earth for coopera- tion-Zeus through Thetis to Achilles. This would indeed be a utopian picture, but the facts force us to remember that the Greek gods were anthropomorphic. All the Greek knew of God was what he saw of God in man. In other words, his god was man idealized into something more than man, just man writ large; and his heaven was earth idealized into some- thing more than earth, just earth writ large. Naturally this con- ception was fraught with both weal and woe for the Greek gods and the Greek heaven and for men and earth as well. As the Greek gods had evil within them as well as good and as the Ho- meric Greeks, just like their contemporary Hebrews, held deity responsible for the evil in the world as well as the good, the heav- enly influence was naturally sometimes a baneful one. Be it said to Homer's credit, however, that his gods usually co6perated, 515</page><page sequence="2">516 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL not for man's bane, but for his blessing, as an unbiased reading of his poems will certainly prove. Although Homer wrote primarily to give pleasure by the artistic portrayal of interesting transcripts from human life, one cannot read his two poems through without finding in them his belief in a providential order-call it a diabolical providential order on occasion, if you will. The gods and fate, as a dark shadowy back- ground, rule the world; that belief permeates the Iliad and Odys- sey. The wrath of Achilles but fulfils the will of Zeus, so Homer tells us in the opening lines of the Iliad. In the opening lines of the Odyssey Zeus in the presence of a grand conclave in heaven charts the course of the Odyssey from beginning to end. Issuing from this conclave we have a most important twofold pronouncement from the father of the gods: First, man's sorrow comes to him through his own sin-this is our doctrine of the free will of man; second, the gods care for man and warn him, though frequently in spite of this he goes heedlessly to his doom-this is our doctrine of Providence. It was the glory of Achilles that in the exercise of free will he could choose between two courses and that he chose the noble life. And this leads to a consideration of one more thing-and that very important-before we can have a perfect appreciation of our Ja- cob's ladder in Homer. The poet also believed something else, which naturally grew out of his anthropomorphic conception of deity, namely, that man has God within him-a god-force pulling toward the evil sometimes but far more often toward the good. We often read in Homer of the man "breathed on by the gods" (7ervvP4vos) and of the "godlike" man (Kbos). In other words, Homer held that man has free will but that he also has the divine within him that enables him willingly to will the will of God. In Homer the presence of the gods among men usually does not detract from natural action, from human initiative, from human free will, for the reason that these Homeric gods often seem but an innate quality of the man personified, the divine in man exter- nalized and made concrete by visible manifestation. Therefore, the man is acting in character; he is not deprived of that liberty of action which belongs to real life everywhere. Although the gods are continually helping men, we feel that human personality is not</page><page sequence="3">THE JACOB'S LADDER IN HOMER 517 dwarfed by the great poet; rather in Homer human personality is emphasized and glorified by these heavenly interventions. This Jacob's ladder, up and down which the gods are continually making their way, and these concrete pictures of co6peration be- tween God and man, so concrete and real that they preclude a doubt, are one of the great spiritual heritages of our race. This very closeness of heaven and earth, this very nearness of God to man that Homer depicts, will be a crying and beckoning call to the generations of men until some one generation shall make it reality in human experience. Such is the spiritual tug of Homer, like the tug of the moon on the tides. Let us now take up interesting and characteristic examples of this Jacob's ladder in the Iliad and Odyssey. Let us look at the first appearance of divinity in the Iliad. Achilles was drawing his sword and was just on the point of slaying Agamemnon, when Athena came down from heaven, as sudden and dramatic an apparition as the angel to Abraham. She seized him by his fair hair-her two eyes flashing terribly-her message, "Thou shalt not kill." With almost superhuman self-control he obeyed her; he put his sword back into its sheath and then turned around-but Athena had returned to Olympus. What is the meaning of this Jacob's ladder in action here? Achilles was being carried away by passion when the goddess of wisdom appeared. Surely in a very real sense Athena was his own sober second thought personified. Why did he recognize her at once? This was by no means her first appearance to him; she had often before nipped his anger in the bud. Why did her two eyes flash terribly at him? Because she knew he was a very Titan among men, with volcanic passions straining at the leash. To Homer, and even to us, what more striking way could there be for driving home the fact that calm judgment con- trolled his passion and reason held him firm than by picturing Athena coming to him in person with discipline from the gods? How vividly dramatic the poet, who could make concrete for us the abstract forces that play in human hearts! In a very real sense, as we have said, Athena stands for his own sober second thought; so she does not make of Achilles here a puppet, a mere pawn on a chessboard. In fact we almost feel that</page><page sequence="4">518 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL Achilles would have done as he did without divine help or, at least, that all he needed for the doing of his duty was just this touch of heavenly inspiration. But if this be, in part surely, his own act, why introduce the goddess at all? Because Homer believed in the providence of God. Athena, then, is to be thought of as inside Achilles; but she is also to be thought of as outside the man-divine-and it is not hard to enter into sympathy with Homer's point of view. Where, pray, do good thoughts-conscience-come from, if not ultimately from God? To us, brought up on modern psychology, Athena appears subjective, little more than an abstract thought personified; but to Homer, who had a vivid, mythologic mind, she was objective, a goddess. In terms of her godhead he thought and lived his life, and so did his Homeric world. Thus endeth one of the most dramatic passages in literature, a vivid and clear-cut picture of a human soul, victorious in a battle with temptation. As one of my students put it, "Here we have all of the naturalness of man and all of the power of God"-a perfect example of the Jacob's ladder. At every crisis in Achilles' life the goddess Thetis arose from the sea like a lovely mist and tried to help her son as only a mother can. In Book I she took his problem to Zeus in prayer; in Book xvIII she went to Olympus to ask Hephaestus to make for him a suit of divine armor. Picture her descending from heaven with that golden armor, and again you have our Jacob's ladder in radiant action. Let us now consider the last appearance of Thetis to Achilles in Book xxIv. Her mission from heaven made possible the spiritual climax of the whole poem. The physical climax is to be found, of course, in Book xxII where Achilles conquers Hector; but in Book xxiv he does a far harder thing-he conquers himself. For revenge Achilles has been dragging Hector's dead body thrice daily around the tomb of Patroclus. The gods look down with pity; some of them in the heavenly conclave propose that Hermes be sent to steal away the corpse, but Zeus pronounces judgment: "No, we will send Thetis to persuade him to give Hector back." Notice how Zeus safeguards the free will of man, evidently be- lieving that Achilles in his own heart will decide to do the magnan-</page><page sequence="5">THE JACOB'S LADDER IN HOMER 519 imous thing. At once we see two goddesses descending to earth to carry out the will of Zeus: Thetis to Achilles and Iris to brave old Priam to influence him (already half minded to do so) to carry out a most daring plan, namely, to go to Achilles, bitter enemy though he was, and beg back the body of his son. Achilles also had evidently been fighting out this battle in his own soul; he knew that an early death was awaiting him, too, and he himself was beginning to be moved with compassion as he looked on the dead Hector. When his goddess mother came, in whose presence he was always inspired to be his best, he instantly responded to the will of Zeus: "So be it, if the Olympian himself so biddeth." No outer authority here; thus even in old Homer's view the divine within answered to the call of the divine without. To Achilles' hut Priam went, conducted by Hermes. The scene that follows between Priam and Achilles is as affecting as any in the literature of our race. Slowly, with terrific struggle, but surely Achilles conquers himself. The fine dramatic quality of the passage and its fine psychology, revealing step by step the changes through which our hero passes until he comes out a man transformed, leave an indelible impression upon one. We have reached the culmina- tion of our poem; what greater thing can any man do than master himself-and love his enemy? "The poet's design becomes plain; he will have us regard Achil- les not merely as a physical hero but also as a spiritual one; the man is endowed with colossal passions, yet with the more colossal power of transcending them; human he is to the last degree, yet also divine, goddess-born."' He was not deaf to the still small voice of God. As we know, Achilles was not destined to a long life; he had chosen between a long life of mediocrity and a short life of service to his fellowmen. And yet despite this shadow of early death hovering like a cloud over the brilliant morning of his life, he climbed "the ladder of the soul" to the topmost height of him- self, and then-the poet has the good sense to bring his poem to its close, leaving Achilles in the full vigor of his young knighthood, resplendent like the sun. 1 Denton J. Snider, Homer's Iliad: St. Louis, William Harvey Miner Co. (1922), 480. To this book the writer is deeply indebted and also to the same author's Homer's Odyssey, published the same year by the same company.</page><page sequence="6">520 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL There are two very significant divine interventions in Book Iir of the Iliad. As he richly deserved, Alexander was badly beaten in his duel with Menelaus. But Aphrodite saved him from death, shrouding him in thick mist, and set him down in his own chamber in Troy. Then she went to summon Helen from the wall where she had been watching the duel with excited interest-for was not she herself the stake? What is the meaning of this intervention of the goddess? We must consider it a sort of allegory, a broad general image of that which actually occurred. Homer says Aphrodite came to Paris; may we not say Aphrodite was his own passion personified, just as Athena, in part, was Achilles' own sober second thought personified? Let us conceive of Alexander sneaking from the ring in some disguise, under a cloud of dust, or hidden by the dense crowd. It is Aphrodite, Passion, who leads him; she is the dominating force in his life. "His sensuous is far stronger than his warlike nature. She spirits him out of the combat; when there is danger to his dear body, the grand instrument of pleasure, she makes him a coward."2' This is just Homer's naive, concrete way of telling the story, externalizing everything. Alexander, as we have seen, was acting from within; he certainly was acting in character; but to Homer Aphrodite was outside him, too, a god- dess, the embodiment of a great, surging world-force. As Mr. Snider writes, we have an artistic interplay in this book between the outer conflict, the duel, and the inner conflict, the battle going on in Helen's own heart (love for Menelaus versus love for Alexander); so the outer conflict is but a reflection of the inner, which indeed gives meaning to the outer and makes it of absorbing interest. Both Greeks and Trojans have made a solemn compact that Helen is to belong to the winner of the duel. By every right, therefore, she now belongs to Menelaus; and that both Alexander and Helen know right well. At this point Homer shifts from the outer duel to the inner duel in Helen's heart, which she fights with Aphrodite, who has just ignominiously delivered Alex- ander and now comes to the tower to tempt her as well as him. She assumes the shape of an aged woman, a wool comber, an old-time 2 Snider, Homer's Iliad, 194.</page><page sequence="7">THE JACOB'S LADDER IN HOMER 521 Spartan friend of Helen, who perhaps once before had encouraged her to yield to passionate desire and elope with Alexander. This is Homer's way of stating what indeed we all know from bitter experience, that temptation usually assails us in subtlest guise. She plucks the robe of Helen, saying, "Alexander wants you to come home." She adds for Helen's temptation: "He is very hand- some and handsomely attired; he doesn't look like a man returned from war but like a man going to a dance." Helen recognizes the messenger, though in disguise; she recognizes Passion, for she has often encountered her before. She sees the beauty of the goddess, which not even the ugliness of the old woman can hide, " the beau- tiful neck, desireful bosom, and lustrous eyes," and she is visibly affected; for Homer tells us "her heart was stirred in her breast." Still she puts up a show of resistance and assails Aphrodite: "Leave heaven thyself and become his wife or his slave! I shall not return to that man's couch; it would be a shameful thing, and all the Trojan women would blame me." Then that wail, "Oh, I have sorrows already past counting!"-the last touch of the old contrition before she yields. With impatience the goddess wrath- fully replies- "I'll hate you and desert you!" That is, Aphrodite means, "You 11 lose your beauty. You won't have your beauty always; so enjoy it while you may." Aphrodite continues: "You'll die soon, too-I'll see that you die. I'll make both Greeks and Tro- jans hate you so that, when peace is declared, they'll kill you." That is, she means, "Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die"--"enjoy life while youth and life last." Subdued, Helen veils herself, ashamed of her action, and follows the goddess, Passion, into the presence of Alexander. It is the old story of a fight in the hour of temptation, even if one yields in the end. Alexander in self-defense tells Helen that Menelaus has won in the duel because of Athena's aid but that he, too, has a god on his side. And most assuredly he has! That Aphrodite has just played a most base and contemptible r6le no one will deny. Lust always plays such a r61le. Here as a force for evil she appeals to the evil in both Alexander and Helen, and they answer to her call. This is a part of the Homeric dualism; occasionally human beings are inspired to evil. In the beginning of Book ii we find another evil influence step-</page><page sequence="8">522 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL ping down, or rather flying down, the Jacob's ladder connecting heaven and earth. Here, too, as in Aphrodite's appearances to both Alexander and Helen, this evil influence seems to be but a quality or faculty of mind personified and externalized. Homer tells us that Zeus, in carrying out his plan of honoring Achilles, sent a lying dream to Agamemnon. This dream stood above his head in the likeness of Nestor, who was held in unusual honor by Agamemnon-there again we have temptation in subtlest guise. The dream whispered in his ear: "Arm your Greeks with all speed; you can now capture broad-wayed Troy." Agamemnon believed this (Homer adds, "Fool that he was!"), for this dream was really his own egotistic plan personified, his own egotism externalized. The dream was within him, the thought that he could get along very well without Achilles' help, but it was also outside him, a part of the divine plan. We exclaim, "What! Zeus deceive his worship- ers! God lie to man!" But there is no shock here for the mind with perspective. The fact is that Homer and our Old Testament alike find in God the source of human error. An exact parallel is found in the passage of the Old Testament where Jehovah sent a lying spirit to entice Ahab to his doom. In the Odyssey we find this same Jacob's ladder cementing earth and heaven together. One of the most interesting interven- tions is the descent of Athena to the princess Nausicaa in the first part of the Phaeacian episode. The goddess hovers over her in a dream in the form of one of her girl companions and sends her to the seashore to make her wedding clothes clean and glistening and to superintend the family washing-ostensibly-but really to have Odysseus meet her and find welcome in the palace. "Yet Athena's scheme does not conflict with the free will of the maiden, which finds its fullest scope just in this household duty."3 As Homer pictures her, Nausicaa stands for girlhood in the bloom of youth, and thoughts of marriage are ever in her mind. The young princes of the island are all wooing her, so fair is she. It is only natural for her to be thinking about accepting one of them, about an early marriage, and, therefore, about the washing of her wedding 3 Snider, Homer's Odyssey, 161.</page><page sequence="9">THE JACOB'S LADDER IN HOMER 523 clothes. So she goes out that eventful Monday (?) morning to wash; but who can say she is not acting in character, since she is but doing what a girl in her situation would naturally do? Athena is in the girl as well as outside her; in Homer we often have the inner man and the outer God co6perating in just such delightful ways. It is worth noting that Homer found Providence in the tossing of a ball. When Nausicaa and her maidens were playing ball, while waiting for the clothes to dry, the poet reminds us: "The goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, took other counsel, that Odysseus might awake and see the fair-faced girl, who should lead him to the Phaeacian city. So then the princess tossed the ball to one of her maids; the maid she missed but cast it into a deep eddy, and thereat they screamed aloud, and noble Odysseus awoke."4 That misthrown ball of the princess Nausicaa was one of the links in the chain of the providential home-going of Odysseus. He was to meet Nausicaa, that through her he might have a favorable reception in her father's court and, therefore, an escort home. In the first part of Book I of the Odyssey we have the assembly of the gods in heaven; in the second we have the carrying out of their will on earth. Athena (taking the form of Mentes, an islander friend of Odysseus) descended to Ithaca to inspire Telemachus to play a man's part in the world. At the time of her coming Telemachus was sitting among the wooers in the reception hall of his father's palace, seeing in his mind's eye his noble father, re- turned, scattering the suitors and held in honor once more as king over his own people. Truly this young prince had a receptive heart, for it was something like the content of this daydream of his that Athena had come to tell him. Still Athena here had a very impor- tant work. Telemachus was only daydreaming; as a matter of fact, he had almost ceased to look for his father's return; and with the suitors there outrageously consuming his inheritance the poor boy had almost ceased to believe in a divine providence. Surely he needed God's help! She assured him that his father would not be long absent from Ithaca. She fed him on constructive thoughts, 4Od. vI, 112-117.</page><page sequence="10">524 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL realizing their value as surely as any modern psychotherapist. She told him that he looked like Odysseus and asked him if he were not Odysseus' son; when assured that he was, she said: "Act like him then; be the man your great father was and is; lay down the law to the suitors and go with ship in search of your father." Thus she prompted him to action and inspired him to do what, as a growing young man, he had already begun to feel he ought to do. "She is a veritable goddess to the young striver, speaking the word of hope and wisdom. Still the goddess is in him just as well, is his thought, his wisdom."' Here again, as so often in Homer, we have inner man and outer God reaching toward each other and finding themselves akin, united in a common bond of thought and action. With this new inspiration in his heart, he called an assembly of the people and demanded that the suitors leave his home and give him a ship so that he might set sail in search of his father. But because of the influence of those brigand-wooers the Ithacan assembly broke up without granting either request. In fact, the last thing the wooers desired was the return of Odysseus. One thing was clear: Telemachus could expect no aid from the town meeting. Where should he get his help? From God. Out to the seashore he went and prayed; and Athena drew near in the likeness of Mentor, guardian friend of the family. She inspired him again; she told him that she would equip for him a swift ship and that she herself would go with him. There is heavenly co6iperation for you! Not "God so loved the world," but still an instance of God's care for man that bids one pause and think. As she had promised, Athena, in the likeness of Telemachus, went through the city to secure for him his ship and crew. This done (again in the guise of Mentor) she spoke these cheering words:"Telemachus, already thy comrades sit at the oar. Come, let us go."' Homer adds: "Saying this, Pallas Athena led the way in haste, and he followed in the footsteps of the goddess." That reminds us of the Christian hymn, "Where He Leads Me, I Will Follow." Now 6 Snider, Homer's Odyssey, 26. 6 Od. i, 402-406.</page><page sequence="11">THE JACOB'S LADDER IN HOMER 525 why did Athena take the form of Telemachus when she was ar- ranging for this trip? Are we rationalizing too much if we put it in the following way? Was it not because Homer realized that, if a man wants something done, after all God usually cannot, or will not, do it for him, but the man must do it for himself-God working through the man? I know Homer said the goddess did it, and with his mythologic spirit he more than half believed it. Indeed, Telemachus was god-filled when he did it. Homer was a born fabulist, mythologist. Those appearances of Athena were Homer's natural, objective way of telling us that God's spirit of wisdom is at work in the world. In Book iii Athena (still in Mentor's shape) and Telemachus reach Pylus, Nestor's home. But unfortunately the old king knows nothing about Odysseus, since he and Odysseus had separated on the homeward road; so he advises Telemachus to go to Sparta to question Menelaus about his father. Athena agrees with Nestor in advising this visit. She now quits Telemachus as a personal com- panion in the flesh (Mentor); now he must shift for himself and make the rest of the journey for the most part on his own re- sources. Homer's view of life is that too much reliance must not be placed on external deity; it is the man inspired of God who is to accomplish the tasks of the world. Man must exert himself tre- mendously, or else the gods cannot help him. We like the Homeric heavenly interventions, for they ring true to human experience. Just before the climax of our poem Odysseus, ostensibly a poor beggar, had gone to bed in the forehall of his own palace, pondering evil for the suitors and watching with almost uncontrollable exas- peration his own serving girls slipping out to their embraces. He tossed upon his bed wondering how he could endure it and yet how he could do anything, one man against so many. Then it was that Athena came down from heaven in the likeness of a woman and stood above his head and said:"Why now again art thou wake- ful, unfortunate beyond all men? Lo, this is thy house, and there within are thy wife and thy child, such a man, methinks, as any one might pray to have for his son."7 And Odysseus answered her: 7Od. xx, 33 ff.</page><page sequence="12">526 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL "Yea, goddess, but how can I, all alone as I am, handle the suitors who are always in a body?" Then the goddess replied: "Obstinate one, many men trust weaker friends, friends who are mortal and not wise as I am wise; but I am a god, and I guard thee to the end in all thy toils. . . . Go to sleep." So she spoke and shed sleep upon his eyelids, but herself, the fair goddess, went back to Olympus. Another most inspiring example of our Jacob's ladder. Another Bible verse comes to mind, "Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world." Such continual recurrence of the intervention of the gods in human affairs-what does it all mean? Denton Snider writes: "Let us observe, then, first, that the poet's principle is not to allow a divine intervention to degenerate into a merely external mechan- ical act; Homer puts the divine influence inside the individual as well as outside, and thus preserves the latter's freedom in the providential order."' God is in man! That is the great hypothesis of Europe's first poet; that made possible in both Iliad and Odyssey the Jacob's ladder, which rainbow-like joined earth to heaven and heaven to earth. This principle reconciles us to the seemingly unfair part played by Athena in the duel between Achilles and Hector. The goddess brings back to Achilles the spear that had missed Hector, but she fails to restore to Hector the spear that had vainly struck Achilles' shield-on the face of it most perfidious favoritism on the part of the goddess. But "Homer is the direst confusion, unless we see the ever recurring correspondence between the inner man and the outer divine influence."' Hector was the author of his own destruction. In his soliloquy spoken just before he faced Achilles we have in a nutshell the tragedy of the last ten years and especially the tragedy of the last twenty-four hours of Hector's life. For ten years he had been fighting for a cause in which he did not believe; and yet he had been compelled to fight for it, for it was the cause of his father and mother, his wife and baby boy. 8 Homer's Odyssey, 159. 9 Snider, Homer's Iliad, 419.</page><page sequence="13">THE JACOB'S LADDER IN HOMER 527 Yet well in my undoubting mind I know The day shall come in which our sacred Troy, And Priam, and the people over whom Spear-bearing Priam rules, shall perish all.10 These words voice the forebodings of his inner heart. Hector realized that he was fighting for a lost and perfidious cause. This realization plus the tragedy of the last twenty-four hours of his life, to which I shall now refer, caused even in that gallant warrior a character disintegration that inwardly corresponded to the out- ward confusion brought upon him by Athena. We must remember that Polydamas had advised him, and that his aged father and mother had pleaded with him, to come inside the walls and not to face Achilles outside alone, but Hector had refused. Intoxicated with success and the desire for personal glory-for just this once in his noble life-Hector had refused to put country before self, and he now felt resting upon him the crushing weight of the death of countless comrades slain on the very morning of this fatal day by impetuous Achilles. Could he go back within the walls and acknowledge his mistake amid the jeers of hate and the I-told- you-so's of Polydamas and his party? At this crisis-strangely unlike himself-Hector seemed unable to do his duty; and so he stayed out there to meet his foe. Under such circumstances could he fight his best? He fled, pursued by Achilles around the walls of Troy. And then when he did deceive himself (Homer says Athena deceived him in the semblance of his brother Deiphobus) into thinking that he could turn around and confront Achilles, could he make good use of his arms? True, he hurled one spear, but without force enough to perforate Achilles' shield. Then, Homer says, "He stood confused." He turned around, expecting to receive from Deiphobus (namely Athena, who had already restored to Achilles the spear he had hurled) a second spear; but lo! he had vanished-and Hector had no spear to use. Hector had thrown his spear away in the inner man; Homer says the outer goddess brought it not back to him. "It was Athena who played me false," he cried. Yes, it was his 10 Iliad vi, 447-449 (Bryant's translation).</page><page sequence="14">528 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL own poor judgment that had tricked him. In desperation he rushed on Achilles with his sword-only to be struck down before Achilles' feet! Say that this contest was disappointingly unfair, as from our point of view it was; say that Athena's help given Achilles here was external and that it lessened his glory; say that Athena's help promised to Hector (though withheld) would have been external and unfair; but it seems to me that the help Hector needed on this occasion was primarily internal, and no internal help was forth- coming. The weakness of a lost cause was manifest in Hector's tryst with Fate in that last hour. In a very sad way, he personified the cause of a dying Troy. Internal weakness-guilt-how could they wield effective weapons or win the day? Hector's confusion of spirit was but attributed to Athena, whose function it was to give wisdom and take it away-it was really his own. Think back over the phenomena of the duel. Were they external, caused by the outer goddess? Rather, was not all that was significant internal and but the imagery of Hector's own tragic thoughts, externalized as phenomena caused by the goddess? Achilles won fairly enough, for Hector was in a daze; so dazed that, to strip the passage of all its imagery, he had somehow forgotten to provide himself with that second spear. It was a case of disintegrated personality. And yet the world's verdict is that Hector was the noblest knight that fought in the war at Troy on either side-and so he was-and, therefore, the most pathetically tragic character, for the guilt of his country struck home upon him as upon no other. We shall always admire Hector as a man, despite the fact that, in this crisis of the war, he fell just a little short as a soldier. His very tragedy, which whelmed him into ruin, gives him entrance to our hearts. To Homer's mind the outer god was so intimately connected with inner experience that he naturally described this duel in terms of divine causation, for the Homeric man apparently was always translating internal experience into external imagery. This external imagery served to give him the same ideas we get from our abstract thinking. Our difficulty in appreciating the course this duel took lies in the fact that in our thinking there is no con- nection at all between the outer god and the inner experience. But</page><page sequence="15">THE JACOB'S LADDER IN HOMER 529 when we have acquired the poet's point of view, this combat gives us in a measure the same satisfaction it afforded him and his Ho- meric world." Homer used the gods to explain all sorts of accidentsl2 and psychological phenomena, and such descriptions gave no offense to his contemporaries, because to their minds these religious stories still left the world-as we know it today-at the mercy of accident and subject to the laws of human psychology and ex- perience. We moderns, if we find no allegory here, are offended when the gods are made responsible for the accidents and evils of life. How badly Homer needed our biblical devil! For a last generalization, we may say that Homer's explanation for everything that takes place in outer nature,'3 as for everything that takes place in the psychology of our inner lives, is God working around us and in us. All of the phenomena of our outer lives, even the accidents that befall us, are due to God; likewise, all of the phenomena of our inner lives, our thoughts, dreams, deeds, talents, and accomplishments, we owe to God; to Homer God and man were in a very real sense one. His universe was a universe God- explained and God-inspired. He naturally thought in terms of God. Perhaps the blind old bard could see with his eyes shut more than we can see with our eyes open. He found God everywhere in his world both outside and inside man. There is, to be sure, a great difference between "everywhere" and "somewhere," but some- where the modern world, too, must find God. Homer gives us a naive, a childlike, an imperfect religion but a religion that cannot be scoffed at, because it springs from the deep wells of the human heart and answers to some of its deepest needs. This splendid co6peration and interrelation between God and man, which the Greeks recognized centuries ago, needs to be rethought today in modern terms. We have gone to the other ex- 11 An interpretation along similar lines reconciles us to Apollo's interference in the duel between Hector and Patroclus. For another instance of daze, attributed by Homer to Poseidon, which the modern psychologist would call a natural experience of con- fusion, see Iliad xii, 434-442. 12 These accidents may well have been caused by the individual's own carelessness.
