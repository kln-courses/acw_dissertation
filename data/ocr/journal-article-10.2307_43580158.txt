Choksy The majority of the silver drahm and gold dēnār coins issued by the Sāsānian king of kings Wahrãm II ( ivlķCn , Warahrän), who ruled between A.D. 276-93, bear more than one bust on the obverse. The most common obverse type (Plate 10, 1), features three busts, two facing right and one facing left. Another obverse type (Plate 10, 2) bears two busts, one in right profile and the other in left profile. A third type (Plate 10, 3) has two busts both turned right. By contrast, single portraits of the ruler (Plate 10, 4) are comparatively rare. The identifi- cation of these three obverse busts has long been a cornerstone of Sāsān- ian numismatics, history, and art history. The present study reconsi- ders and modifies the accepted identifications and questions the histo- rical conclusions that have been deduced from them.1 This study also investigates the identities of the two standing figures depicted on the reverses of Wahrâm's drahms and dēnārs. Two types of reverse motifs 1 It is a pleasure to thank Michael L. Bates, Ian A. Carradice, and Nancy M. Waggoner for their assistance with the coinage. I am grateful to Richard N.

Choksy were minted, one depicting two figures bearing staves and flanking a fire altar with heads turned away from the altar (Plate 10, 2), and a second with two figures turned toward the altar (Plate 10, 1). The identities of the individuals depicted on the obverses of Wahräm ITs coinage were first discussed by Andreas Mordtmann, who concluded that the main bust on the obverse of each coin represented the monarch himself, facing right. Mordtmann suggested that the secondary bust, behind that of the king, portrayed the queen who also faces right. The tertiary bust which faces the king and queen was in the opinion of that scholar, a portrait of the crown prince or heir apparent who was often depicted with a diadem in hand.2 Mordtmann's identifications were echoed by William Valentine without any discussion of their validity.3 Furdoonjee Paruk also accepted the identify of the busts and added that the erect figures on the reverses of these coins depicted the king to the left and his queen to the right of a fire altar.4 Paruck concluded that Wahräm had sought to present the most important personages of his immediate family - the queen and crown prince - together with himself on the coinage. The identity of the obverse busts, although accepted by numis- matists, remained unsupported until Robert Gobi attempted to demonstrate that the obverses of these coins represented bust groups modeled on a Roman pattern which dated to the dynasty founded by the emperor Lucius Septimius Severus (146-21 1).5 Claiming that these group portraits represented the "dynastic idea," Gobi identified the figure on the right of the obverse fields as the depiction of a series of four crown princes. In support of his conclusions, Gobi claimed that a rock relief scene at Naqsh-e Rostam, in which Wahräm is presented together with three princes, matched the coinage in the depiction of 2 Andreas D.

In addition, Gobi compared Wahrâm's coinage with rare issues from the reign of Ardashīr I (ruled 224-40) whose obverses bear the portraits of the founder of the Sāsānian dynasty and his crown prince Shāpūr (later Shāpūr I, ruled 240-72).6 Gobi, however, differed with Mordtmann, Valentine, and Paruck in regard to the identification of the figures on the reverses of these coins. Because the figure to the right of the fire altar often bears a diadem, Gobi concluded that such reverses (Plate 10, 1) represent investiture scenes in which Wahrãm II, to the left of the altar, was shown receiving a diadem from a deity. Numisma- tists, historians, and art historians agree that this divinity was probably Anāhitā, a goddess who was revered as the patron deity of the Sāsānian dynasty.7 Michael Mitchiner followed Gobi in identifying the various group portraits as those of the king, queen, and heir, the king and heir, and the king and queen respectively (Plate 10, 1-3).8 But he concluded, without stating any reasons, that the figures on the reverses of the coins depicted attendants. Next, Vladimir Lukonin accepted Gobi's identifi- cations, attempted to reconstruct the chronology of royal succession, and even utilized the coin portraits to determine the identity of indivi- duals depicted on rock reliefs and silver vessels.9 Later, David Sellwood, Philip Whitting, and Richard Williams postulated, on the basis of the commonly accepted obverse identifications, that Wahrãm paid great attention to the status of his wife or wives and sons in court protocol.10 According to these scholars it was this preoccupation with status and protocol that led to the depiction of the queens and princes on Wahrãm ITs coinage and rock reliefs. Thus, from an unsupported identification made in 1880 by Mordtmann and subsequently elaborated by Gobi, 8 Robert Gobi, "Sasanian Coins," The Cambridge History of Iran, vol. 3, 2, ed. E.

Choksy conclusions have been reached on the nature of dynastic succession and court protocol in third century Iran. THE KING OF KINGS As Valentine, Paruck, Gobi, and others have repeatedly demon- strated, there can be no doubt that the main bust on the left of the obverse fields of these coins was intended to represent the ruling monarch Wahräm II. This bust corresponds closely in facial and crown features with that on issues which bear only the king's portrait on the obverse (cf. Plate 10, 1 and 4). Wahräm was also named in the obverse legends on these coins in accordance with established Sāsānian royal protocol mzdysn bgy wlbl'n MLK'n MLK* * yVn MNW dry MN yzďn, "The Mazdean lord Wahräm, king of kings of Iran, whose lineage [is] from the gods." Further, comparison of the crown and facial features of the monarch's bust on the obverse with those of the figure to the left of the fire altar on the reverse reveals that the monarch was depicted on the reverse of his coinage standing beside his regnal fire (cf. obverses and reverses of Plate 10, 1-4). Indeed, this regnal fire bears the king's name, as documented by the reverse legend NWR * Z Y wlhVn, 'The fire of Wahräm." Usually the monarch appears to the left of the fire altar, most often with his back toward it (Plate 10, 2-4), but occasionally he faces the fire (Plate 10, l).11 Indeed, there is a direct correlation between the two types of reverse motifs and the bust scenes on the obverses. Only if the obverse bust of the king is offered a diadem by the tertiary bust on the right of the obverse field does the figure of the monarch face the altar on the reverse (cf. Plate 10, 1 and 2). In all these obverse and reverse depictions, Wahräm was shown crowned with a diadem bearing a sphere or disk. This royal crown always has a pair of wings, believed to repre- sent an eagle or royal falcon - the seventh incarnation of the Zoroas- trian god of victory Varaörayna (Wahräm) - attached to it: 4 'The lord- 11 On one drahm, however, Wahräm was portrayed to the right of the fire altar.

Further evidence for the identification of this monarch is provided by the rock reliefs at Barm-e Dilak, Bishapur, Guyum, Naqsh-e Bahram, Naqsh-e Rostam, and Sar Mashhad all of which depict the monarch exactly as he was portrayed on the imperial coinage.13 The close parallels between the depictions on the rock reliefs and the coin portrait reveal that the king's image had to be reproduced in accordance with an established portrait. It is likely that other members of the royal family also had standardized images of themselves which were reproduced when neces- sary. 12 Wahräm Yašt , "Hymn to Varaörayna" ( Yašt 14), 1. 19.

Skjaervo, "Kirdir's Vision: Translation and Analysis," Archaeologische Mitteilungen aus Iran 16 (1983), p. 302. Calmeyer and Gaube propose that the relief at Sar Mashhad depicts a prince ( šahryár ) protecting the Zoroastrian priest KirdTr by slaying a lion and is an allusion to Kirdir's vision of heaven and hell. Although KirdTr is depicted in this relief, the individual who slays the lion wears the crown of Wahräm II and can be none other than king of kings himself. Further, the female in this relief does not match the description of Kirdir's dēn or personification of good deeds, but resembles Shäpürduxtag the queen of queens who was depicted on the coinage. Thus, it would be reasonable to conclude that the Sar Mashhad relief was meant to serve as a depiction of Wahräm II's valor rather than as a scene from Kirdir's eschatological journey.</page><page sequence="6">122 Jamsheed K. Choksy THE QUEEN OF QUEENS The figure represented by the bust second from the left on the obverses of this coinage has been identified by most scholars of Sāsānian numismatics as a queen or a succession of queens who held Wahrâm's favor.14 Close examination of this bust discloses that it was meant to represent a single individual, since the feminine facial characteristics of the bust were constant through the entire coinage. The crown worn by this female figure has four variants: a bonnet hemmed with an undulat- ing ribbon, rosettes, or pearls (Plate 10, 3), a bonnet with a boar's head (Plate 10, 1), a bonnet with a griffin's head (Plate 10, 5), and a bonnet with a horse's head (Plate 10, 6). These depictions reveal that the royal bonnet with variations such as undulating rosettes or the depictions of animal heads attached to it must have been the headdress of the chief queen. The identification of the portrait as that of the chief queen is confirmed by one coin type which bears the ancillary legend šhypwhrdwhtky MLKVn MLKT ' "Shäpürduxtag, queen of queens."16 The legend must refer to the female bust, facing right, on the left of the obverse field. This bust, thus, was meant to represent Shäpürduxtag, the chief queen of Wahräm II and the daughter of Shāpūr the king of Mesene.16 Additional evidence is provided by rock reliefs at Barm-e 14 For an example of the ambiguity as to whether the bust(s) represents one queen or several, see Gobi, Sasanian Numismatics (above, n. 5), p. 44, where the terms "queen" and "queens" are both used in this context. However, Lukonin (above, n. 9) pp. 116-17, identifies the portraits as those of only one queen. 15 Lukonin (above, n. 9), pp.44 and 116; and A. Shapur Shahbazi, "Studies in Sasanian Prosopography," Archaeologische Mitteilungen aus Iran 16 (1983), p. 266. 16 Shäpürduxtag was mentioned in the inscription of Shäpdr I on the Ka'ba of Zoroaster at Naqsh-e Rostam (1. 21), Richard N. Frye, The History of Ancient Iran (Munich, 1984), pp. 371-73, see also p. 304. The title MLKT'n MLKT ' was used in Shapflr I's inscription for Dēnag the sister and wife of Ardashl* I (1. 23), and for Ādurandhld the daughter and wife of Shapdr I (1. 18). Further, Dēnag, the queen of queens, may be identified on an amethyst seal in the Hermitage museum which bears a woman's bust together with an inscription which reads: dynky Z Y MLKT'n MLKTf mhysty PWN tny *š*psťn, "Dēnag, queen of queens, who [am] the mistress over the persons [in] the harem."

Both reliefs depict Wahräm II with his queen of queens who resembles the busts on the coins where she wears the hemmed bonnet.17 Further, her rank is clearly stated in an accompa- nying inscription at Barm-e Dilak. Once again, the correlation between the coin busts and the rock relief figures indicates that official portraits were utilized. The iconography of the boar-headed and horse-headed bonnets rein- forces the conclusion that the wearer was the queen of queens because, like the wings on Wahräm's crown, these features functioned as symbolic representations of the Zoroastrian god of victory Varaörayna. According to the Wahrãm Yašt, the horse and boar are said to be the third and fifth incarnations of this ancient Iranian god: 4 4 the lord- created Varaflrayna approached a third time, hastening in the form of a white, beautiful horse with yellow ears. . and "the lord-created VaraÔrayna approached a fifth time, hastening in the form of a ferocious wild boar with sharp teeth, with sharp tusks, a boar that kills with one blow, unapproachable when angry "18 The griffin, combining the characteristics of a lion, which was regarded as a symbol of sovereignty, and an eagle or royal falcon, the bird whose form the god Varaôrayna takes in his seventh incarnation, reaffirms the symbolic and marital interconnections between the queen, her monarch, and his god.19 The eagle was also a form assumed by the royal glory or xvardnah (xwarrah) which was believed to the bestowed by the gods upon the chosen ruler.20 This royal glory was represented by the diadem of sovereignty in the dynastic art of the Sāsānians. The above evidence clearly demonstrates that there need be no ambiguity regarding the female figure on the obverse left of Wahräm ITs coins - only one female was Silver Vessels of the Sasanian Period, vol. 1 (New York, 1981), pp. 34-35; and Vladimir G.

There is, however, no correlation between this bust and the figure on the right side of the reverse field; the crowns do not match and, although the figure on the reverse often represents a female personage, the facial features are not similar. Consequently, Paruck's identification of the figure to the right of the fire altar as the queen cannot be accepted and an alternate identi- fication must be proposed. THE MINOR BUSTS AND THE REVERSE FIGURE When the facial features of the tertiary busts, on the right side of the obverse field of Wahräm ITs coins, are examined carefully it becomes clear that they represent three individuals. The depictions of these three individuals were generally constant throughout the entire coinage, and represented a youth crowned with a Median bonnet (Plate 10, 11), a young female crowned with eagle-headed and beaver-headed bonnets and extending a diadem (Plate 10, 1, 5, 6, and 7), and a male who was crowned with horse, eagle, and boar-headed bonnets (Plate 10,2). There are, of course, minor variations between issues as would be expected for the work of different die engravers who probably worked at separate mints.21 Examination of the specimens in the American Numismatic Society's cabinet, together with those published by Paruck, Gobi, Mitchiner, and Mochiri revealed that the obverse and reverse types were not restricted to issues from a few linked dies.22 21 Although the recording of mint names on Sāsānian coins does not appear to have been firmly established until the reign of Wahräm V (ruled 421-39), there is evidence that a few mints did exist in strategic regions of the empire from the early days of the dynasty. See Gobi, Sasanian Numismatics (above, n. 5), pp. 22-23; and Gobi (above, n. 6), pp. 331-32. Of course, the Sāsānians would have inherited the mint system founded by the Seleucids and expanded by the Arsacids. See Edward T. Newell, The Coinage of the Eastern Seleucid Mints, ANSNS 1 (New York, 1938); and David Sell- wood, "Parthian Coins," The Cambridge History of Iran, vol.3, 1, ed. E. Yarshater (Cambridge, Eng., 1983), pp. 279-98 and 316. 22 Because of the absence of mint names it is difficult at present to assign the die linked coins to specific mints. The only published collection not already referred to is that in Malek I. Mochiri, Étude de Numismatique Iranienne sous les Sassanides et Arabe-Sassanides, vol. 2, 2nd ed. (Tehran, 1977; rpt. 1983).</page><page sequence="9">Wahrãm II 125 Variations in style indicate that the types were engraved by more than one die cutter and issued at multiple mint sites - although the names of these sites were not recorded on the coins. The Crown Prince As mentioned at the beginning of this study, first Mordtmann and then Gobi proposed that all variants of the tertiary busts be identified as the portrait of a crown prince or a series of crown princes. However, unlike the cases of the king and queen, there are no inscriptions on the coins identifying the bust as that of the heir apparent Wahrãm (later Wahräm III). Further, there are no collabora tory statements in the Middle Iranian inscriptions and codices or later Arabic sources that Wahrãm II so honored his heir(s). There is also no extant evidence that Wahräm's predecessors on the throne had established a precedent of depicting, in royal iconography, a crown prince wielding the diadem of sovereignty while his father was still on the throne. Nor is there any indication that Wahräm's successors continued such a practice. It is essential to note that no data exists which suggests that Sāsānian princes wore the variety of crowns represented on these coins. Contrary to Gobi's claims, the bonnets worn by the princes depicted on Wahrãm ITs rock relief at Naqsh-e Rostam do not correlate with the crowns of the tertiary bust on the imperial coinage.23 Nor do the princes and courtiers from whom the king receives the bent forefinger gesture of deference on the relief at Naqsh-e Bahram wear anything other than the Median or royal bonnet.24 Additionally, the headdress worn by the crown prince Shāpūr on certain coins issued by Ardashīr I (Plate 10, 10) and on Ardashlr's investiture relief at Naqsh-e Rajab is the Median bonnet.26 Likewise, Shāpur Fs rock relief at Naqsh-e Rajab depicts his sons, including the crown prince Hormizd, with Median bonnets.28 23 For Gobi's argument see Sasanian Numismatics (above, n. 5), pp. 44-45. However, compare Plate 10, 1-2, 5, and 6-7, with Vanden Berghe (above, n. 13), pl. 29a. 24 See Vanden Berghe (above, n. 13), pls. 82, a-b. 25 Vanden Berghe (above, n. 13), pl. 25b; Lukonin (above, n. 9), pp. 105-6, and pl.l. 26 Vanden Berghe (above, n. 13), pl. 26b; Lukonin (above, n. 9), p. 106, and pls. 2-3.</page><page sequence="10">126 Jamsheed K. Choksy Further, the amethyst seal of Wahräm the king of Kerman, a son of Shāpūr I (and the future Wahräm I), bears a bust of this prince crowned with the Median bonnet.27 The evidence from portraits of the crown princes Shāpūr, Hormizd, and Wahräm, together with the depictions of princes on Wahräm II's own rock reliefs establishes that the sons of each Sāsānian monarch, including the heir apparent, wore the Median bonnet as a headdress.28 This conclusion is confirmed by a coin issued during Wahräm ITs reign. The coin in question bears the bust of king Wahräm at left on the obverse and the smaller bust of the crown prince wearing the Median bonnet - but without a diadem in hand - on the right (Plate 10, II).29 The reverse of this coin bears the relief of two figures, the king on left and a Zoroastrian priest or Magus on the right with their backs turned to a fire altar. It is clear that only this particular issue of coins bears a depiction of the crown prince on the obverse. As a result, it is necessary to abandon Gobi's hypothesis on multiple heirs to the throne, each of whom possessed a unique crown, and his theory that the principle of dynastic succession was reflected on the Wahräm ITs coinage. Likewise, there is no evidence to support the claim by Sellwood, Whit- ting, and Williams that Wahräm greatly emphasized the status of his wives and sons by depicting the royal family on the imperial coinage. Anāhitā When the facial features of the tertiary female bust are examined, it becomes clear that they match those of the figure standing to the right of the fire altar on the reverse of each coin (Plate 10, 1 and 5-7). The crowns worn by the bust on the obverse and the figure on the reverse always correlate and are of two types: an eagle-headed crown (Plate 10, 1, 5, and 7) and a beaver-head crown (Plate 10,6), with occasional variations such as the decoration of a pearl on the eagle or beaver.30 27 See Harper and Meyers (above, n. 16), p. 29. 28 Rank among the princes was indicated by ensignia on the bonnets. See Lukonin (above, n. 9), p. 106. 29 This issue closely duplicates the imperial portrait of king and crown prince established on the coins of Ardashlr I (Plate 10, 10). 30 For an example of such a variation see Gobi, Sasanian Numismatics (above, n. 5), pl. 4, 68.</page><page sequence="11">Wahram II 127 Whenever the obverse bust was depicted extending a diadem in her right hand to the monarch, this event was replicated on the reverse (Plate 10, 1 and 5-7). The available evidence thus indicates that the bust on the right side of the obverse field and the erect figure on the corresponding side of the reverse field of Wahrãm II's silver and gold coinage were intended to represent the same female personage who was not the monarch's spouse. In the attempt to elucidate the identity of this figure, two other iconographie features of the coin images must be noted: bestowal of sovereignty, and gestures of reverence. A brief analysis of the icono- graphie valence ascribed to diadems by the Sāsānians is necessary at this point. Two types of diadems or rings were depicted on Sāsānian coins, rock reliefs, and silver vessels: a diadem which bears two ribbons, and a plain or unribboned diadem. The iconography of these two diadems was mutually exclusive. The plain diadem is first attested in Iran on a rock relief near Sar-e Pul, dating from ca. 2100-2000 B.C., which commemorates the triumph of Anubanini, leader of the Lullubi tribes. A goddess, identifiable as Inanna, leads kneeling captives into Anubanini's presence while extending a plain diadem to the victor.31 Darius I's (ruled 522-486 B.C.) victory relief at Behistun, which echoes the Sar-e Pul scene, shows the Achaemenid monarch receiving a plain diadem from the winged figure which probably symbolized the creator deity Ahura Mazdã (Ohrmazd).32 Two reliefs from the Parthian (Arsacid) period bear images of plain diadems. One, a rock relief at Tang-e Sarvak, presents a Parthian ruler reclining on a couch with diadem in hand.33 The second image, etched on a stela from Susa and 81 Vanden Berghe (above, n. 13), pl. 125c. 32 See Ilya Gershevitch, ed., The Cambridge History of Iran, vol.2 (Cambridge, Eng., 1985), pls. 34-35. Much discussion has been generated by scholars regarding the identity of the winged figure in Achaemenid art. The Near Eastern and Egyptian precedents which the Achaemenids were heirs to, together with the contexts in which the Achaemenian motif was utilized, favor the conclusion that the figure does indeed represent Ahura Mazdä.

Choksy dated A.D. 215, depicts Artabanus Y (Ärdawän, ruled ca. 213-24) grant- ing a plain diadem to Khwasak, the satrap of Susa.34 Sāsānian monarchs replicated the iconography of the plain diadem. ArdashTr I was shown receiving such a diadem on a rock relief at Salmas in Azer- baijan, while Shāpūr I is offered a similar diadem in his victory relief at Bishapur.35 As the above examples illustrate, the plain or unribboned diadem was usually associated with victory in battle, feats of valor, and courtly life. It was the diadem of victory, an iconographie symbol inher- ited by the Sāsānians from their royal predecessors. On the other hand, the beribboned diadem was introduced into Iranian iconography by the Parthians, and propagated on their coinage. The reverse motifs of Parthian drachmas and tetradrachmas often depict a Tyche presenting a beribboned diadem to the enthroned monarch.36 The Sāsānians assimilated this symbolic investiture of monarchs by the gods. ArdashTr I was shown receiving beribboned diadems from Ahura Mazdā on rock reliefs at Naqsh-e Rajab, Naqsh-e Rostam, and Firuzabad.37 Shāpūr I accepts a beribboned diadem from Ahura Mazdā on a relief at Naqsh-e Rajab, and another from a winged figure (modeled on the Parthian coin images of Nike) at Bishapur.38 Indeed, the Greek codex which records the life of the prophet Mani mentions Shāpūr's coronation: ". . .the year in which the Persian king Dari-Ardashīr conquered the city of Hatra, and in which king Shāpūr, his son, donned the greatest diadem ... ."39 Likewise, Wahräm II receives beribboned diadems on his coins (Plate 10, 1 and 5-7).

The transi- tion from "victory" to "fortune" reflects modification of the hellenic diadem of victory into the Iranian diadem of divinely granted fortune. 37 See Vanden Berghe (above, n. 13), pl. 25b; 28c; 70b. 38 Vanden Berghe (above, n. 13), pls. 27 and 77b. 39 A.

Therefore, although based on a hellenic prototype - the wreath of victory - the beribboned diadem became the Iranian symbol of legitimate sovereignty or royal glory {kavalm xvardnah) which was bestowed by the gods upon the king of kings.41 On the coinage of Wahrãm II, not only was the female being shown in the process of extending the beribboned diadem of sovereignty to the king of kings, but, in addition, on the reverse of these coins the monarch has either raised his right hand with the palm turned toward the holder of the diadem (Plate 10, 6), or else made a gesture toward her with his bent right forefinger (Plate 10, 1, 5, and 7). The raised right hand and the bent forefinger both served as gestures of reverence to deities in the ancient Near East and Iran. As noted by Richard Frye, the raised right hand gesture was assimilated by the Iranians from their Near Eastern neighbors, and Darius I was depicted on the Behistun relief performing this form of veneration to the winged figure, symbolizing Ahura Mazdā, who extends the plain diadem of victory to the Achaemenid ruler.42 The Sāsānian king of kings Hormizd I (ruled 272-73) was depicted on the reverses of some of his drahms with raised right hand, the palm turned outward, in the presence of the god Mithra (Mihr, Plate 10, 8). Mithra can be identified by his crown which bears rays and hence paral- lels the crown worn by this god on the investiture relief of Ardashīr II at Taq-e Bostan.43 The scene on this drahm of king Hormizd with raised 40 Vanden Berghe (above, n. 13), pl. 127a; and Shinji Fukai and Kiyoharu Horiuchi, Taq-i-Bustan, vol. 1, Tokyo University Iraq- Iran Archaeological Expedi- tion Report 10 (Tokyo, 1969), pls. 5 and 27. 41 Consequently, Martha L.

Choksy right hand standing to the left of a fire altar and Mithra extending the beribboned diadem of sovereignty from the right side of the altar, directly parallels the scene on the reverse of many of Wahräm ITs silver and gold coins; only the figure to the right of the altar is a different deity (cf. Plate 10, 6 and 8). Similar coins were also minted by Sāsānian princes who served as rulers of the Kushāns. For example, the reverse type of a dēnār issued by one such provincial governor, Hormizd, king of the Kushāns, at the mint of Marw ( mlwy ) bears the image of the governor with raised hand in the presence of Mithra.44 The equestrian investiture scene on a rock relief commissioned by Ardashīr I at Naqsh-e Rostam portrayed the founder of the Sāsānian dynasty making the bent forefinger gesture of reverence to the deity Ahura Mazdā who extends the diadem of sovereignty to the king.45 Accompanying inscriptions identify both the god and the king. Likewise, Hormizd, king of the Kushāns and a Sāsānian prince, was depicted on the reverse of a copper coin from the mint of Herat (btlywy) with bent forefinger standing in the presence of Ahura Mazdā and a small altar.46 The accompanying inscription helps identify the deity who was referred to as the bwlz'wndy yzty, "exalted god." Other copper coins minted by this prince at unnamed mints replicate this motif (Plate 10, 9). The gesture of the bent forefinger attained multiple symbolic valence during the Sāsānian period. Consequently, it was depicted on coins and rock reliefs in two contexts during the first century of Sāsān- ian rule: employed by the king of kings and his subjects as a sign of reverence for the gods and the diadems of sovereignty and victory, and by princes and courtiers as a mark of submission to the king of kings. The raised right hand, however, was reserved by the Sāsānians exclu- sively as a gesture of worship for deities. Since the female figure on the right side of the obverse and reverse fields of Wahrâm's coinage extends a diadem and receives the two 44 See Christopher J.

Identification of this goddess is possible from the following features: she is erect, high girded with prominent breasts, and wears a pleated garment (Plate 10, 1 and 5-7); she wears four-sided earrings (Plate 10, 1) and a neckpace (Plate 10, 1, 5, and 7) ; the diadem of her crown has a prominent rim (Plate 10, 5-6), and is adorned with ribbons (Plate 10, 1 and 6-7). The physical attributes of this deity match those of only one ancient Iranian goddess, Anāhitā (Anãhld), whose cult was widespread under the Achaemenians and Sāsānians. This goddess incorporated, by the Sāsānian era, not only the Avestan water deity Aradvī Sūrā Anāhitā but also the ancient west Iranian goddess *Anāhiti, the personification of Venus, who had previously been fused with the great Mesopotamian deity Ishtar.47 Anāhitā even took over the attributes of Aši, the Avestan goddess of fortune. Thus as goddess of victory and kingship (*Anāhiti), of water and fertility (Anā- hitā), and even fortune (Aši), Aradvï Sūrā Anāhitā could bestow king- ship upon individuals whom she favored. The Ābān Yašt, modified prior to the Sāsānian period to include the expansion of Anāhitā's divine role, describes her as follows: Aradvī Sūrā Anāhitā who is always to be seen in the form of a beautiful, very strong maiden, fair of body, high girded, erect, of noble origin, of noble lineage, dressed in a valuable much- pleated golden garment. . . . displaying her four-sided golden earrings, Aradvī Sūrā Anāhitā of noble birth, always wears a necklace around her beautiful neck. She girds herself around the waist in order that [her] breasts are well shaped and swell out. Upon [her head] Aradvī Sūrā Anāhitā wears a beautiful, well-made, golden diadem, with a hundred stars, eight-sided, made like the body of a chariot, adorned with ribbons, [and] 47 This goddess's cult is described by Mary Boy ce, "ArdwTsür Anāhīd," Encyclo- paedia Iranica , vol. 1, 9, pp. 1003-5; and Marie Louise Chaumont, "Anāhīd: The Cult and Its Diffusion," Encyclopaedia Iranica, vol. 1, 9, pp. 1006-9.

Aradvī Sūrā Anāhitā wears beaver robes. . . .48 There are, of course, variations between the Avestan depiction of Anāhitā and her depiction on the imperial coinage. The eight-sided star-spangled crown was replaced with either a beaver-headed crown (Plate 10,6) or an eagle-headed crown (Plate 10, 1). This variation is not surprising because it is unlikely that the Sāsānian rulers, the Zoroastrian priests, and the die engravers fully comprehended the language of the Y ašt.*9 It is more likely that the popular descriptions of this goddess's incarnate form, preserved in oral religious traditions and folk poetry, were utilized in creating the coin images. The beaver would have been prominently associated with Anāhitā because of her role as a water goddess; the coin portraits maintained this symbolic association by placing a beaver-headed crown upon her head. Similarly, the eagle would have been connected to her function as a bestower of kingship.60 In addition, as noted earlier, the eagle was linked to the royal glory or xvardnah which ensured legitimacy of rule. Hence, its insertion on Anā- hitā's bonnet in Wahrâm's coinage was symbolically valid. Conse- quently, A. Shapur Shahbazi's argument that Sāsānian representations of Anāhitā would have carefully maintained every detail of her Avestan description is implausible.51 Shahbazi has raised another objection to the identification of Anāhitā figures in Sāsānian art and iconography. Basing his analysis on the rock relief commissioned by king Narseh (ruled 293-302) at Naqsh-e Rostam where the king and a woman jointly wield the beribboned diadem, Shahbazi has accurately argued that the female figure cannot be a 48 Ābān Yašt ( Yašt 5), 11. 126-29. 49 Robert C.

The elongate sewn sleeve was indeed a sign of deference to the king of kings even in Wahräm II's era as is attested by his queen on his rock reliefs at Barm-e Dilak and Sar Mashhad. However, on the reverse of Wahräm's coins Anāhitā's left hand was not enclosed by a long sewn sleeve, but was placed at her waist just as Mithra's was on Hormizd I's investiture coins (Plate 10,1 and 5-8). Further, unlike queen Shäpürduxtag II on Narseh's rock relief, Anāhitā does not share the diadem with the monarch; she alone wields it, and confers it upon Wahräm. Therefore, although Shahbazi's conclusion is valid for the rock relief of Narseh, it cannot be applied to the image on Wahräm II's coins. As a result it is safe to conclude that the female figure on the right side of the obverse field and the right side of the reverse field of the imperial coinage of this king was meant to represent the Zoroastrian goddess Anāhitā. On the obverses of these coins she fulfills her role as bestower of kingship by investing Wahräm II with the beribboned diadem of sovereignty (Plate 10, 1 and 5-7). On the reverse, the goddess either confers the berib- boned diadem of sovereignty (Plate 10, 5) or the plain diadem of victory (Plate 10, 1 and 6-7) upon the king of kings. V drdOrayna The identity of the male figure whose bust bears horse, eagle, and boar-headed crowns now must be deciphered.53 This individual was portrayed as a mature, young man (Plate 10, 2), not a tender youth as was the crown prince (Plate 10, 11). As discussed earlier in this study, the horse, eagle, and boar were incarnations of the Zoroastrian god of victory Varaôrayna.54 According to the Yašt dedicated to this deity, Varaörayna could also take the form of a heroic young man: "The lord- 62 Shahbazi (above, n. 15), pp. 262-63, with pls. 24-25. 58 Gobi, Sasanian Numismatics (above, n. 5), pl. 4, 55-56, 63-64, provides photo- graphs of coins with this bust wearing the complete range of crowns. 64 Above, pp. 120-21 and 123.</page><page sequence="18">134 Jamsheed K. Choksy created Varaflrayna approached a tenth time, hastening in the form of a handsome, intelligent, Mazdā-created hero."55 The incarnations listed in the A vesta thus correlate closely with the coin image: the bust represented the deity in his incarnation as a hero, and the crowns symbolized three other important forms he could assume. In addition, the motif of an eagle or royal falcon linked Vdrdd- rayna to the royal glory which also assumed this form.56 Further evidence that the eagle served as an iconographie symbol of this god is found in a series of gold coins issued by the Kushān ruler Kaniška I who probably ruled during the first century A.D. The reverse fields of this issue bear the erect image of Varaôrayna (OPAArNO - Orlayno) wearing a crown that bears an eagle.57 Likewise, the god was associated through name with the monarch on the obverse and the regnal fire on the reverse of each coin. Finally, a bust engraved in a medallion on the Sāsānian silver cup discovered at Sargveshi in Georgia must have been intended to depict Varaôrayna and not the crown prince, because king Wahräm II was shown paying reverence with a bent forefinger to the god who may be identified by the horse-headed crown which he wears. Additionally, Var90rayna extends a plain diadem. Indeed, the bust in the medallion closely resembles the busts of Varaflrayna on the coins.58 In summary, the present study has demonstrated that the obverse fields of Wahräm II's imperial coins bore the busts of (a) Wahräm II, the king of kings of Iran, (b) Shäpürduxtag, the queen of queens, and (c) either Wahräm the crown prince, the goddess Anähitä, or the god Var^örayna. The crown prince was always depited wearing a Median bonnet, Anähitä with an eagle or beaver-headed crown and a berib- boned diadem, and VaraÔrayna wearing a horse, eagle, or boar-headed 56 Wahräm Yašt ( Yašt 14), 1.27. 56 Above, p. 123. 57 Robert Gobi, Münzprägung des Kušānreiches (Vienna, 1984), p. 44, pl. 8, 63. 58 See Lukonin (above, n. 9), pl. 23.

The reverse fields of these coins were of two types (a) the monarch and a priest, or occasionally dual images of the monarch, flank- ing the regnal fire, and (b) the king paying reverence to Anāhitā while receiving the beribboned diadem of sovereignty or the plain diadem of victory from her across the regnal fire. There is no numismatic evidence that Wahrãm II propagated a dynastic principle of succession by depic- tion of his family on the coinage. The iconography of Wahrãm ITs coinage represented manifestations of the symbolics of power.59 Claims to legitimate rule were transmitted throughout the empire by manipula- tion of divine images that Iranians could apprehend in both religious and secular terms. 69 An interesting general discussion on the symbolism of royal authority is offered by Clifford Geertz, "Centers, Kings, and Charisma: Reflections on the Symbolics of Power," Local Knowledge : Further Essays in Interpretive Anthropology (New York, 1983), pp. 121-46.</page><page sequence="20">Plate 10 Wahram II</page></plain_text>
