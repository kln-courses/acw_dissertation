Associated with the Cerny Culture, these vestiges offer a privileged insight into the social transformations of Middle Neolithic communities in France. Following bioarchaeological analyses, the aim of this paper is to compare and discuss the social status of the dead in the monumental cemeteries characterised by their long barrows, and the flat graves without structures. The biological identity of the dead (age-at-death and sex), the grave goods and the spatial organisation of the graves underlines the prominence and the role of diverse categories of individuals, which could be related to different social ranks ordered into a hierarchy. The women are marginalised and few men appear to be the central figures of the monumental cemeteries. Surprisingly the same individualisation is present in flat cemeteries and the mortuary organisation suggests similar status. The highly structured society of the dead as it appears inside and outside the giant enclosures questions the monument as a significant element of social discriminations.

The sex-ratio in PTS cemeteries is inversed: Some "remarkable instruments" can be distinguished 57% of the adults are men. In this case, the proportion from "common tools" according to a specific function, of individuals of unknown sex is quite large (n = 20) and a rare representation or a sophisticated shaping could highly influence the results.

However, it is the to the age-at-death of the individuals (adults/children: age limit under which the children are frequently Fisher's exact test, P = 0.0319), and the grave good excluded from the cemeteries. This report suggests that distribution (presence/absence: Fisher's exact test, the age-at-death criterion could not be given as a strict P = 0.0152) (Thomas 2011: 406–407). Thus, the graves and unique reason to explain the differential mortuary located west of the cemetery (group A) are those of pattern among the children.
