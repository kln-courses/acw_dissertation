This essay considers the relation of oral and written traditions to landscape and trees with reference to Murray Bail's novel Eucalyptus and Virginia Woolfs "Anon."

Broadly, these two approaches could be summarized as, on the one hand, scientific, rational, straightforward, and written, and, on the other, intuitive, natural, circuitous, and oral. This essay relates Bail's novel to Virginia Woolf s late, unpublished essay of about 1940-41, "Anon," which emphasizes the connection that existed between an oral tradition and the landscape and open air, before Caxtons printing press and the predominance of the printed word changed a communal "audience" into indoor, individual readers and writers of texts. The essay also refers to more recent writers, including Michael Pollan, who seek to recover "the complex reciprocal relationship between the human and natural world" (Pollan xiv). These contributions further displace the once prevailing, confident anthropocen- trism in relation to the natural world, highlighting instead the agency of non-human life forms, the interdependency of species, and the co-evolution of their histories.

Ostensibly, Eucalyptus sits unproblematically in the genre of fiction. However, my claim is that the novel Eucalyptus can also be sit- uated within the "new poetics" of "co-eveolutionary histories," although most of the other titles in this genre are categorized as "popular science." Entitled simply with the name of a tree (or genus of trees), who are the eponymous main character(s), the novel also focuses on the human behaviours prompted by those trees, and the modes of narration used to express human/arboreal relations. At the human core of the novel Eucalyptus is the tale of a man called Holland who, after acquiring property in western New South Wales, despite scarcity, time-con- straints, and environmental adversity, collects and cultivates as many species of euca- lypt as he possibly can: On days when Holland secured an especially rare specimen he felt like a pearl-diver who has burst to the surface, holding up a treasure. Certain eucalypts were rare because they rarely took root beyond a narrow radius. They were sensitive to drainage, lime in the soil, degrees of frost, elevation, rainfall and God knows what. Some stubbornly refused to grow in the month of March, others the week after Christmas. One tree would thrive in the shade of another; another would not. They were hypochondriacs demanding esoteric manures and watering by hand. How he managed to cultivate to healthy size a Darwin Woollybutt (E. miniata ), or those born in sandy deserts, is a mystery. The Silvertop Stringybark (E. laevopinea) requires 1000mm rainfall every year, and the Snow Gum, its name proclaims, thrives on altitude, sleet and ice. Somehow he had eucalypts coming forth on ordinary ground when normally they demanded clay, flat marsh or granite. After many false starts he encouraged the little Yellowtop Ash, so called, to poke out of some rocks. And so on. (44-45) Obsessed with eucalypts, he creates what is "virtually an outdoor museum of trees" and becomes "a world authority in a narrow field" (45). But these trees are not the only thing in his care - nor are they the only living things on which he tries to impose his nurturing will. His beautiful daughter Ellen, who had once been his helper and had shared his interest in the trees, is now listlessly yearning for a life and interest of her own, perhaps in Sydney. Her father has other plans for her. Of the various testaments cited on the cover and first pages of the paperback edi- tion by London's Harvill Press, few would lead the reader to believe that the eucalyp- tus itself was anything other than incidental or an atmospheric backdrop. Most reviews note that an unusual courtship is central to the tale and that a suitor appears</page><page sequence="3">Shelley Saguaro 41 to a young woman from "among the gum trees." There are various cover designs for the several editions that have appeared since the novel was first published (and indeed, several change the title to Eucalyptus : A Novel perhaps in case anyone should be misled generically). However, on the Harvill edition, the frontispiece is a stand- alone, black-and-white botanical illustration of a eucalypt, courtesy of the Natural History Museum of London. Within that edition, as in every edition of the novel, each of the chapter titles is the Latin name of one of the extremely diverse species of Eucalyptus. The first is "Obliqua" (the pages that follow have the heading E. obliqua), the second " Eximia " (and E. eximia ), and so on, through to Chapter 39, " Confluens ," a name that signifies not just in botanical but also in literary terms, in the bringing together of narrative threads and the happy conjoining of lovers. There are more eucalypts in the world than the thirty-nine chapter headings; indeed, the story begins by stating that there are in existence "several hundred eucalypts; there is no precise number" (3), and each headed chapter may also contain reference to several other species. This is not, then, should anyone briefly suppose it, a reliable or comprehen- sive botanical compendium, but rather something playful. However, these conceits and the story itself are, on closer inspection, highly topical and a reflection on some serious matters that both include and extend beyond botanical collections. The duces narrator eucalypts opens obliquely, the novel in in line a conversational with the named mode species with a discussion and chapter that heading intro- duces eucalypts obliquely, in line with the named species and chapter heading Obliqua : "We could begin with desertorum , common name Hooked Mallee" (3). A lit- tle later, dispensing with "the very word, desert-or-um" because it "harks back to a stale version of the national landscape and from there in a more or less straight line on to the national character," the voice continues: "We might as well turn to the rarely sighted Eucalyptus pulverulenta, which has an energetic name and curious heart-shaped leaves, and is found only on two narrow ledges of the Blue Mountains. What about diversifo- lia or transcontinental7" (4). The first two or more pages of the narrative include a halting deliberation about which eucalypt could best begin this novel: "all thaťs needed, aside from a beginning itself, is a eucalypt independent of, yet one which ... it doesn't really matter." In the next line, the narrator resorts to an anthropocentric nov- elistic convention: "Once upon a time there was a man - what's wrong with that? Not the most original way to begin, but certainly tried and proven over time" (5). If the nar- rator falls back on convention, he does so only to highlight it as such. Nonetheless, nov- elty is retained in the way in which consideration of eucalypts continues to punctuate, even drive, the narrative. For instance, Chapter 2 begins by departing from the narra- tive momentum of the story of Holland's courtship, his marriage, and the birth of his</page><page sequence="4">42 Mosaic 42/3 (September 2009 ) daughter to consider tree qualities as metaphors for national attributes: "Some peo- ple, some nations, are permanently in the shade. Some people cast a shadow. [. . .] It's very pine-like. [. . .] Clarity, lack of darkness - these might be called 'eucalyptus qual- ities"' (16), and, by extension, "Australian" attributes. Chapter 3, on E. australiana , commences by acknowledging: "Some description of the landscape is necessary. At the same time (be assured) strenuous efforts will be made to avoid the rusty traps set by ideas of a National Landscape, which is of course an interior landscape, fitted out with blue sky and the obligatory tremendous gum tree [. . .] the kind of landscape seen during homesickness and in full colour on suburban butchers' calendars." The passage continues, "Every country has its own landscape which deposits itself in lay- ers on the consciousness of its citizens" (24), and it is not generally difficult to iden- tify the botanical icons in various national landscapes: the robust oak in England; the dour Scots pine; the vivid Canadian maple; the imposing American redwood; the resilient baobob of Africa. If a national or individual character might be seen as "pine- like" or as having "eucalypt qualities," then trees are also given human attributes: for example, "cussedness," having "civil disobedience in its nature," or being "proud" (59). Australia has its iconic "gum tree," which belies the variety and diversity of Eucalyptus as a genus. Bail exploits the propensity to burden trees with métonymie and metaphorical connotations: while the conflation of all diversity into the reductive "gum tree" is one danger, the other lies in the profusion, and confusion, of specific names, both Latin and common, of so many species. For instance, while the very name E. australiana conjures up residual connections "as a sort of flagpole of the sub- conscious" in its Australian context, the very same tree is also a native of Tasmania, where it is commonly known as the black peppermint gum. Bail's narrator irritably corrects Holland's too hasty and sedimented unconscious iconography when prompted by the nationalistic Latinised name: "Of course, from any angle the Black Peppermint looks nothing like a flagpole (and Holland had no right to load a simple eucalypt with such a worthless association)" (37). On the other hand, to name a thing is to "see" it, as the story-telling young suitor explains: "We are not comfortable if a thing we have seen isn't attached to a name. An object can hardly be said to exist until it has a name, even an approximate name" (261). The naming of trees, their attributes, and their connection with the stereotypes that accrue to national identities, including landscapes, are playfully explored by Bail and his narrator. How and why do trees get named - and by whom? As postcolonial writers such as Jamaica Kincaid have argued, "to name is to possess." In Kincaid's view, the naming and claiming of indigenous species by European collectors and sci- entists, often with eponymous epithets, were acts of both egocentricity and disrespect.</page><page sequence="5">Shelley Saguaro 43 This naming also heralded a dislocation for the inhabitants, who lived among the flora and fauna of their own habitat (home), which was, in Kincaid's case, Antigua: "This ignorance of the botany of the place I am from (and am of) really only reflects the fact that when I lived there, I was of the conquered class and living in a conquered place; a principle of this condition is that nothing about you is of any interest unless the conqueror deems it so" (89). For the metropolitan conquerors, "these new plants from far away, had no history, no names, and so they could be given names" (91). When seventeenth-century European explorers and collectors arrived on mainland Australia, where all but two of the six hundred species of Eucalyptus grow, they at first misrecognized the tree as a European species commonly found in Madeira and the Canary Islands, Sanguis draconis , or dragon tree, but then "discovered" that this gum- exuding tree was "new": the eucalyptus (Santos). Colin Tudge notes that, with trees, "there are three main routes to identification" (34). These are: "botanical 'keys,'" DNA samples, and "to know" (emph. mine); the post-Enlightenment Europeans have favoured the two former "scientific" methods, whereas indigenous peoples have relied on the latter, relational approach. As Tudge explains, this method "is how we recognize friends and family. Recognition is uncon- scious; and the unconscious does not need to check out the shortlist of diagnostic fea- tures that the key-makers or the forensic image-makers must refer to, but takes into account a dozen (or a hundred?) secondary clues. [. . .] Many people grew up in trop- ical forests and some of them recognize trees [. . .] as readily as any of us recognize our cousins and our aunts. In Brazil these indigenous experts are called mateirios " (35). Sometimes the mateirios disagree with the scientists and specialists, and reput- edly "the mateirios have never been wrong" (35). However, the indigenous expert is only "supremely at home" with knowledge (of this particular kind) in one place, the place in which an interrelationship has been formed. For a wider application, a world- wide compendium required something more objective, empirical, and methodical to avoid inaccuracies and confusion. However, the naming of trees, particularly when "English names have been conferred by many different groups of people with many different traditions and for different purposes" (40), often created a muddle rather than a method: "Australians - or, rather, the British who first colonized Australia - seem to specialize in confusion. The true oaks belong to the genus Quercus in the fam- ily Fagaceae. But the Tasmanian oak is a eucalypt, Eucalyptus delegatensis in the family of Myrtaceae; and the silky oak is Grevillea robusta , one of the Proteaceae. [. . .] On the other hand, Australia's 'mountain ash' - the world's tallest broadleaved tree - is another eucalypt. Britain's 'mountain ash,' better known as the rowan, is Sorbus aucu- paria, a member of the Rosaceae. Hmm" (41).</page><page sequence="6">44 Mosaic 42/3 (September 2009) Traces and transliterations of the names used by the Aborigines, whose way of knowing trees would have been along the lines of the Brazilian mateirios and whose naming will have referred to meaningful features and attributes now obscured, are also presently to be found in the "Australian" common colloquial names for various types of eucalypt: jarrah, mallee, coolabah, wandoo. In the novel Eucalyptus , it is "this chaotic diversity," this "maze of half-words and part-descriptions," "constantly con- tracting and expanding, almost out of control" (36), that both engendered and thwarted the efforts to impose an orderly system. A recent authoritative book, The Eucalyptus: A Natural and Commercial History of the Gum Tree , notes on its opening pages, "It has been little more than two hundred years since the founders of modern botany recognized Eucalyptus as an evergreen hardwood genus belonging to the myrtle family (Myrtaceae)" (Doughty 1). However, as Murray Bail's narrator explains, even as the Europeans worked diligently towards a system, idiosyncrasies prevailed: The scientific naming of trees doesn't follow a pattern. In some respects it has an attractive, amateur randomness just like the distribution of the trees themselves. Some names are descriptive of bark, leaves and so on; towns and mountain ranges close to a eucalypťs habi- tat become lengthened and latinised ; explorers and a few tree-interested politicians have left their mark; many professional and amateur plant collectors, and a few watercolour artists, are honoured. The Reverend E.N. McKie, a Presbyterian minister at Guyra, was one enthu- siast, specialising in stringybarks - McKie's Stringybark (E. mckieana). Very often it is the common name that is instantly evocative: Leather Jacket, Weeping Gum, Ghost Gum, Coolibah to name some. How did E. nubilis get its name? A curious one. Nubilis means "marriagable." (98) Nubilis, maidenii, feocunda : so many of the Latin names represent sexual analogies that, while thoroughly anthropomorphic, are also culturally contingent. "This attempt to 'humanise' nature by naming its parts has a long and distinguished history" of thinking "order could be imposed on [. . .] nature's unruly endlessness" (35-36), asserts Bail's narrator. One of the founding fathers of plant classification was the Swedish botanist Carl Linneaus (1707-78), who was devoted to the comprehensive naming of plants and their orders according to a meticulous empiricism. Impartial and scientific as he aimed to be, Linneaus was nonetheless subjected to the mores of his times and thus, as Patricia Fara puts it, "the prejudices of Enlightenment Christian morals are built right into the heart of this scientific plan for plants, which Linnaeus outlined by using romantic words such as 'bride' and 'marriage'" (21). Chapter 4 of Eucalyptus begins with an example of a coy analogy that is "all very prudish": "The word eucalypt</page><page sequence="7">Shelley Saguaro 45 is from the Greek, 'well' and 'covered.' It describes something peculiar to the genus. Until they open, ready for fertilization, the eucalypti buds are covered by an opercu- lum, in effect putting a lid on the reproductive organs" (35). Holland participates in the devotion to analogies of this kind when he gives his thirteen-year-old daughter a gift of Eucalyptus maidenii, a gift that leaves her crestfallen. It is, perhaps, a botanist father s hopeful tribute to his daughter's demure girlhood, but Ellen perceives it as a gift to himself rather than to her: "No amount of blue ribbon around the terracotta pot or explaining the exactness of the botanical name could disguise her disappoint- ment. [. . .] What could she do with a tree?" (91). For Ellen, the analogy between human and tree reproduction seems irrelevant until, wandering several years later, she finds the tree's main trunk impaled with a nail, in an act that is purposeless, incon- gruous, and surely done by her father. It is inexplicable and abstract, and yet it also heralds her own sexual awakening: "She was that age" (92). Ellen, like the trees, is not circumscribed by analogy, metaphor, and definition. There is always something "inex- plicable" exceeding the order imposed. In extends the narrative them to as his a whole, role as Holland a father: takes one two as distinct artist/creator approaches and the to his other trees as - cura- and extends them to his role as a father: one as artist/creator and the other as cura- tor/warden. When Holland first takes over the ownership of the property, he walks over it, touching the ground and meeting it step by step, in a manner that is much less newly proprietorial than humble and attentive. Holland's stance at this early juncture seems to hark back to an earlier era, pre-scientific, pre-systematic, pre-Natural History, akin to if not identical to that of the mateirios. Instead of naming and claiming, Holland is, albeit briefly, described as listening to the landscape; this is an annuncia- tion of land to man, in contrast to the Adamie mode of man in charge, actively nam- ing. "With each step the landscape unfolded and named itself. The man's voice could be heard singing out-of-tune songs" (6). Soon, however, Holland starts to plant his trees, and at first it is "casually" with "no apparent design" (34). Then he becomes more systematic, although he studiously maintains the effect of randomness, as metropoli- tan garden designers had done before him: "he followed the greatest painters and English landscape gardeners who struggled with the difficulty of reproducing the ran- domness of true harmony, demonstrated so casually in nature" (39). After this, his scheme moves on and his poetics become more precise: "parallel to one side of the house, he planted 110 seedlings in scientific formation" (40). Then he mirrors by pro- gressive enactment the "developments" of horticultural history, at home and abroad: "on the flat ground alongside the river, species of smooth girth had been chosen to represent (so it seemed), the uniform stillness of a rubber plantation" (41). Similarly,</page><page sequence="8">46 Mosaic 42/3 (September 2009) he treats his daughter as if she should be penned or staked or planted by "trying to prescribe a narrow radius for a daughter over undulating ground" (55). He has more success with his collection of trees. Holland becomes at last aware that his adolescent daughter does not share his penchant for the eucalyptus trees, at least not in the same way, but he nonetheless devises a plan whereby only a man who shares his passion for eucalypts could be her husband. The man in question must identify and recite correctly the name of every tree on the property. Ellen becomes the prize-in-waiting as he escorts the contestants around his "museum." There are several suitors, with varying degrees of knowledge and obsession, such as the man "with impressive credentials" whose "ambition was to discover an unknown eucalypt species, even a subspecies in order to have it named after him" and who, unbeknownst, had "recently on a ledge in the Grampians [. . .] trodden on and destroyed the only remaining plant of an unknown dwarf euca- lypt" (97). One suitor in particular makes his application, comes to stay, and threat- ens to succeed. He is Mr. Cave from Adelaide, "the city of eucalypts," an expert with a reputation - he has "quite a name in the eucalyptus world" (67) - and a confident contender: it is "a sure sign of confidence to call eucalypts 'things'" (77). Then another contender appears, one who is definitely "unofficial" and elusive: "the stranger," who is unnamed and unknown, and who appears out-of-doors, among the trees, to Ellen alone. He tells her stories that she realizes, as time goes on, are somehow, though not obviously, bound up with the trees themselves. On the one hand, Mr. Cave, like his host - who is "methodical" and "always going forward" (79) - desires that the world, and any stories telling of it, be matter-of-fact. He values information, facts, and certainty, and the well-ordered world of scientifically classified trees provides protection against feeling that things, including himself, are "accidental": "At least the world of trees offered a solid base. After all, here was an entire world, psychology-free, a world both open and closed. The task of classification and description was complexity enough. Eucalypts, for example, were an intricate subject he could almost contain with his own shape, as if it was a single, endlessly reproducing person" (162). On the other hand, the stranger, the wooer among trees, the mean- derer - who speaks "words and words, hour after hour, from tree to tree" (153) - has a completely different relation to story-telling and to the trees and their names: "As Ellen entered the stories, or his sketches for stories, she saw how they grew from the names of the eucalypts, usually the less fancy common names. And if many of the stories were based on the flimsiest of foundations, or even a complete misreading of the name, it hardly mattered" (153). Interestingly, however, "the stranger never actually named the tree" (106). Although her strange outdoor suitor eschews "general knowledge" as</page><page sequence="9">Shelley Saguaro 47 "probably overrated," Ellen soon realizes that "to tell the stories it was necessary for him to know the names of many eucalypts. [. . .] Story followed story, in and out of the trees" (231). Ellen's extreme malaise, her longing for the elusive story- weaving suitor and dread of the imminent success of the list-loving, classification-adept Mr. Cave, is eventually diagnosed: "She could only be brought back to life by a story" (243). Mr. Cave makes his own attempt at a cure, with a succinct, terse-sentenced narrative about his former fiancée and their unromantic, expedient attachment. His method of narra- tion has a similar sense of expedience and desperation: "He too would have to try something. If a story he told could bring her back to life their problems, whatever they were, were solved. He began racking his brains. It's always easier telling a story in the first person. The going feels altogether smoother. It can produce a rushing frankness in the story-teller, as if the T was actually revealing some distinct inner truth" (245). Hitherto, the stranger's tales have "none of them relied on the usual 'I this, I that' which all adds up to 'I am'" (256). Even a "personal reminiscence" is all told "without the insistent T"(257), and with an acknowledgment of outdoor influences: "'The most important events of my life,' he began, 'have taken place in parks, gardens, light forests . . .'" (256). At last, the stranger reveals that although his naming of the euca- lyptus trees has been circumloquacious, he is in possession of every single name of every single tree, having delivered the order of the printed metal name plates and ticked them off the list: "All the trees named, every single one of them" (264). Thus, the stranger wins the contest by virtue of a list of botanical names, but, unlike Mr. Cave, he woos and wins Ellen with his out-of-doors inspiration and his interconnect- edness with the trees, the landscape, and Ellen herself. The stranger, with his mysteri- ous anonymity and his relational intimacy, is thus reminiscent more of the mateirios or troubadour than of the botanist or scientist. Virginia was unpublished Woolf s essay in her "Anon," lifetime, on is which germane she to worked the un-named, in 1940 and wandering, 1941, and wooing, which was unpublished in her lifetime, is germane to the un-named, wandering, wooing, out-of-doors storyteller in Eucalyptusy with his oral narrative and his "I-lessness." In the essay, Woolf traces the impact of the Caxton's printing press, in particular, on Anon, who in a pre-literary time was "the common voice singing out of doors," giv- ing "voice to the old stories": The voice that broke the silence of the forest was the voice of Anon. [. . .] Thus the singer had his audience but the audience was so little interested in his name that he never thought to give it. [. . .] Everybody shared in the emotion of Anon's song, and supplied the story. Anon sang because spring has come; or winter is gone; because he loves; because he is hungry, or</page><page sequence="10">48 Mosaic 42/3 (September 2009) lustful; or merry: or because he adores some God. Anon is sometimes man; sometimes woman. He is the common voice singing out of doors. He has no house. He lives a roam- ing life crossing the fields, mounting the hills, lying under the hawthorn to listen to the nightingale. (382) According to Woolf, "Caxton's printing press foretold the end of that anonymous world; It is now written down; fixed; nothing will be added" ("Anon" 385), and installed the difference between the writer - "whose words are printed in a book with his name to it" (389) - and the minstrel of the seasons, of the passions and instincts, of "common belief" (389). Mr. Cave, though no writer as such, has an allegiance to the printed word, to "the I," to names and classifications, to facts - the effects of Caxton's press, the scientific Enlightenment, and the more contemporary context of "the growth in higher education and leisure time" (Bail 260). Thus, Cave's propensity, like those "founders of modern botany" (Doughty 1), is to see named objects, rather than the trees themselves. Interestingly, ecologist and philosopher David Abram, in The Spell of the Sensuous : Perception and Language in a More-than-Human World, writes in a vein reminiscent of Woolf 's essay of more than half a century earlier. Like Woolf, he notes that the development of the printing press in the fifteenth century gave rise to "the profoundly detached view of 'nature,"' that also brought the demise of the anonymous minstrel and storyteller: "The highly anthropocentric (human-centered) mode of experience endemic to alphabetic culture spread throughout Europe in the course of two mil- lennia, receiving a great boost from the calligraphic innovations introduced to us in the monastic scriptoria [. . .] and a major thrust from the invention of movable type by Johann Gutenberg (c. 1394-1468), in the fifteenth century. The printing press, and the dissemination of uniformly printed texts that it made possible, ushered in the Enlightenment and the profoundly detached view of 'nature' that was to prevail in the modern period" (138). Abram discusses the manner in which the printed word now thoroughly eclipses the living referents, akin to Bail's statement "an object can hardly be said to exist until it has a name." Abram is looking for ways to close the gap between the subject and "object" worlds, a gap into which the printed sign intrudes: "Indeed, today it is virtually impossible for us to look at a printed word without see- ing, or rather hearing, what 'it says.' For our senses are now coupled, synaesthetically, to these printed shapes as profoundly as they were once wedded to cedar trees, ravens, and the moon. As the hills and the bending grass once spoke to our tribal ancestors, so these written letters and words now speak to us" (138). Holland's wish to have his collection of trees "fitted with nameplates, the way they do it in zoos and the Botanical</page><page sequence="11">Shelley Saguaro 49 Gardens" (229) is an indication of just how far he has "developed" and moved away from his original communion with this land. Hollands and Cave's allegiance to sci- entific systems, classifications, and collections is reflected in their own narrative propensities, in the widest sense: Mr. Cave's "storytelling" is a straightforward and perfunctory "exchange of information" (163), and his engagement with the trees is "like a machine," as every time he "identified a tree he ticked it off like a tally clerk" (168). The counterpoint to this is, of course, Ellen's and her suitor's intercourse with "the flow of nature" (190), similar to what Abram, citing Maurice Merleau-Ponty, notes as the "I-less" (anonymous) reciprocal engagement with the animate world which "actively 'expresses itself' directly to our senses, so that we may ultimately describe perception as a mutual interaction, an intercourse, 'a coition, so to speak, of [the] body with things'" (55). He continues, "We conceptually immobilize or objec- tify the phenomenon only by mentally absenting ourselves from this relation, by for- getting or repressing our sensuous involvement. To define another being as an inert or passive object is to deny its ability to actively engage us and to provoke our senses; we thus block our perceptual reciprocity with that being " (56, emph. Abram's). Murray Bail is a contemporary writer, alert to the conventions engendered by lit- erary culture and to those aspects of orality and spontaneity now largely abandoned by it. The narrator in Eucalyptus reflects specifically on the changes that shifts in apprehension of and engagement with the world effect on narrative modes: A paragraph is not so different from a paddock - similar shape; similar function. And [. . .] as paddocks are becoming larger, the corresponding shift in the cities where serious print- ing's done is for paragraphs smaller. [. . .] The single-idea paragraph which crowds the newspapers is a difficulty [. . .] everybody knows that a brief rectangular view is not enough. [. . .] Words, yakety-yak, are spoken within the paddock (paragraph). The rectan- gle is a sign of civilization: Europe from the air. Civilisation? A paragraph begins as a rec- tangle and by chance may finish up a square. Who was it said the square doesn't exist in nature? [. . .] A paragraph is supposed to fence off wandering thoughts. (33-34) The paragraph/paddock/civilized mode contrasts specifically with the unnamed alfresco-suitor's sensuous, meandering narrative. This narrator "had a circuitous story-telling manner, as if he was making it up, and what is more, he told it under a tree where the crows were making their din; he also added bits of factual information she had no way of verifying, which seemed to have little bearing on the main thing being said. For all these distractions Ellen found the story powerful for what it may have represented, in other words, for what it didn't say exactly" (99). This out-of-</page><page sequence="12">50 Mosaic 42/3 (September 2009) doors approach, with story-telling effects and narrative contributions from uncon- trolled elements and entities, is the kind of relational position that several authors, including Woolf, in the early 1940s, and Abram and Bail, in the 1990s, have all rec- ommended. In Eucalyptus these effects come from crows, while in "Anon" and Woolf 's related novel Between the Acts, they are the contributions of nightingales, ravens, and cows. These writers seek, not to abandon the written word, but rather to reconnect with those qualities that have been lost or suppressed or obscured by an emphasis on written knowledge. For Woolf, to recuperate Anon and his troubadour qualities is to reconnect with something primal, instinctual, and universal. In her working notes for her last unpublished essays, "Anon" and "The Reader," Woolf listed the following: Ideas for the shape of the book. To begin with the country. The eye the youthful sense. Our floods. This brings back the wildness. Out of doors. Indoors. No study no library. Songs sung at the door. The importance of the audience. No public, in our sense. Anonymity. The song ... the call to our primitive instincts. Rhythm - Sound. Sight. The universality of the creative instinct . . . Stone, wool, words, paint, discuss words. [ . . . ] The wind &amp; the rain. The "modern" . . . the growth of articulateness. The split into several languages for writers. Music . . . Rhythm. The young ladies singing [ . . . ] The chorus. The sound. The song coming in. The nonsense. The Beauty. Something very deep - Primitive. Not yet extinct. the eye, the ear: the senses. (374-76) The aim of both Woolf and Abram, albeit in relation to different crises (imminent invasion and environmental catastrophe, respectively) is to bring us back to our</page><page sequence="13">Shelley Saguaro 51 senses. Abram exhorts readers, writers, all of us, to implement an "ecological approach" and mode of practice: A genuinely ecological approach does not work to attain a mentally envisioned future, but strives to enter, ever more deeply, into the sensorial present. It strives to become ever more awake to the other lives, the other forms of sentience and sensibility that surround us in the open field of the present moment. For the other animals and the gathering clouds do not exist in linear time. We meet them only when the thrust of historical time begins to open itself out- ward, when we walk out of our heads into the cycling life of the land around us. This wild expanse has its own timing, its rhythms of dawning and dusk, its seasons of gestation and bud and blossom. It is here, and not in linear history, that the ravens reside. (273-74, emph. mine) However, Abram's and Bail's approaches, set in the context of late-twentieth and twenty-first-century environmental crises, global warming, climate change, and the cumulative urgencies of ecology and sustainability, are, as we have seen, not new, nor is the connection made between the prevailing view of the world and its narratolo - gies. Perhaps authors, like trees, are eclipsed or delimited by the tags they accrue: for example, Woolf 's perceived status as urbane Bloomsbury modernist. Intriguingly, in 1979 the "postmodernist" John Fowles (who, again, is not well-known for an ecolog- ical approach or for nature-writing) wrote a long essay entitled The Tree , which was reprinted in 2000. In this he too discusses the limitations of the "frozen medium of the printed text" and recounts his sensuous, and writerly, relationship with trees in ways that are reminiscent of the anonymous out-of-doors minstrel in Woolf 's "Anon" and of Bail's suitor/storyteller wandering amongst the eucalypts. He explains, "I do not plan my fiction any more than I normally plan woodland walks; I follow the path that seems most promising at any given point, not some itinerary decided before entry" (59). Fowles expands upon this parallel: In some mysterious way woods have never seemed to me to be static things. In physical terms, I move through them; yet in metaphysical ones, they seem to move through me. [. . .] But even the most "unreadable" woods and forests are in fact subtler than any conceivable fiction, which can never represent the actual multiplicity of choice of paths in a wood, but only one particular path through it. Yet that multiplicity of choice, though it cannot be con- veyed in the frozen medium of the printed text, is very characteristic of the actual writing; of the constant dilemma - pain or pleasure according to the circumstances - its actual practice represents, from the formation of the basic sentence structure to the larger matter of narrative line, character development, ending. [. . .] I now hit on the passage through an unknown wood as an analogy. [. . .] I see now that what I liked best about the green den- sity [. . .] was its explorability. [. . .] I like a kind of wandering wood acquaintance [. . .] always the green chaos rather than the printed map. (58-61)</page><page sequence="14">52 Mosaic 42/3 (September 2009) Thus, Fowles is not merely a "paddock writer" of rectangular paragraphs and linear progression. He retains something of the troubadour, the adventitiousness of wan- dering out-of-doors in the forest, tapping into and contributing to "the reservoir of common belief," "the world beneath our consciousness; the anonymous world to which we can still return" (Woolf, "Anon" 385). The attempt to control by virtue of naming, claiming, organizing, regulating is, as Bail's narrator explains, "residual evi- dence of the oldest fear, the fear of the infinite. Anything to escape the darkness of the forest" (36-37). We should not read this as a simplistic recommendation for a thor- oughgoing return to pre-literary modes or medieval times, however. (These are writ- ers, after all, and the storyteller in Eucalyptus nonetheless wins his suit by reading the list of names.) Rather, the reintegration of elements of a former mode of connectiv- ity and voice with those of science and contract - and linearity - is appropriate for the present ethos, as in the combination, say, of the qualities of orality and writing, of mythos and logos, or in Woolf's terms, of the "butterfly's wing" with "iron girders" (Lighthouse 185). Such combination recovers the "rapture" (Lighthouse 55) of reci- procity and connection, like Abram's "a coition, so to speak" (55). A "nature's recuperation unruly of the endlessness" mysteries to and combine uncertainties them with of "the the darkness prevailing of the ethos forest" of scien- and "nature's unruly endlessness" to combine them with the prevailing ethos of scien- tific and linguistic order has in some cases been deliberate, and in others perhaps less conscious. Of late, alongside a range of other discourses and material on the environ- ment, on sustainability or climate change or biodiversity or regional/seasonal "slow food," a new literary phenomenon is quietly but distinctively emerging. Perhaps "genre" is too delimiting and too reminiscent of that drive to categorize, but popular books published in the last eight to ten years reveal a preoccupation: telling new sto- ries on behalf of botanical species, for instance, with titles such as: The Potato: From the Andes in the Sixteenth Century to Fish and Chips , the Story of How a Vegetable Changed the World (Larry Zuckerman, 1999); The Tulip: The Story of the Flower that has Made Men Mad (Anna Pavord, 1999); Orchid Fever: A Horticultural Tale of Love, Lust and Lunacy (Eric Hansen, 2000); The Botany of Desire: A Planťs-Eye View of the World (Michael Pollan, 2000); The Secret Life of Trees (Colin Tudge, 2005); and Beechcombings: The Narratives of Trees (Richard Mabey, 2007). The titular terms - "story," "tale of love," "life," personal "view" - are familiar, but not in relation to plants or science. Here there is a different slant. The central protagonists are not people, as might be expected, and the verbs in the titles show that it is the plants who are active and the human subjects who are acted upon. People are present in these tales, and there is no doubt that it is people who are telling them. People are not, however, unquestioningly</page><page sequence="15">Shelley Saguaro 53 or omnisciently the prime subjects and active agents. They are not dealing with and describing objects of the natural world simply from an authoritative (epistemological and ideological) perspective, as specimens to be discovered, classified, exploited, transported, and collected. Instead, these are stories in which the "objects" take cen- tre-stage and the human subjects are constellated around them and affected by them. Rather than attempting proprietorial and objective accounts, these narratives reveal instead a "pattern that connects," as architect and designer Charles Jencks puts it, one indicative of a new alignment by which "the universe, not man [...], becomes the 'mea- sure of all things'" (69). For Jencks, this new alignment constitutes, in landscape archi- tecture as in literature, "a new poetics" (69). This new poetics is manifest in those recent accounts of interaction, adaptation, and reciprocal effect noted above: the sto- ries, tales, and narratives of the influence of plants upon humans. In just this vein, Michael Pollan introduces The Botany of Desire: A Planťs-Eye View of the World with an acknowledgment of his own former preconceptions about human autonomy and authority: The ancient relationship between bees and flowers is a classic example of what is known as "coevolution." In a coevolutionary bargain like the one struck by the bee and the apple tree, the two parties act on each other to advance their individual interests but wind up trading favors: food for the bee; transportation for the apple genes. Consciousness needn't enter into it on either side, and the traditional distinction between subject and object is mean- ingless. [. . .] All these plants, which I'd always regarded as the objects of my desire, were also, I realized, subjects acting on me, getting me to do things for them they couldn't do for themselves, (xiii-xiv) With a long career as a "nature writer," from Food For Free in the 1970s to the recent Beechcombings in 2007, Richard Mabey contributes to the new poetics with an emphasis on "conversation": "But perhaps we need a spell not of stories, of mono- logues, but of conversations, mutual exchanges. [. . .] Could we think our way back to a symbiosis with trees, where, in everything that we do with them, we consider what is good for the tree community on its own terms as well as what we can get out of it? [. . .] That's always been our problem with nature, trying to accept its otherness, its independence, at the same time as acknowledging the resonances between our lives, all of us trying to hold the centre. Welcome to the family" (262). Mabey focuses on the beech, the tree he knows and loves best (even though it is "awkward" and "moody," creative and resilient, and "has always been a challenge"), but his approach "applies to all trees" (262) and to other species besides: fish, bees, worms, butterflies, minerals (salt and gem-stones), and more. The shift in emphasis and orientation also affects</page><page sequence="16">54 Mosaic 42/3 (September 2009) the formal aspects of these texts. The volumes mentioned above as indicators of a new literary "genre" are in many ways conventional; they rely on print and the usual para- textual features (such as illustrations, references, and acknowledgments), and they com- prise chapters consisting of contiguous inquiry and argument. They make unproblematic reference, for the most part, to significant dates, scientific developments, and cultural specificities. However, although these books are apparently straightforward and have the conventional authoritative status of a publication, their shift in emphasis from human-centred account to explorations of interrelationship and reciprocity does bring to the texts facets such as conversation, hearsay, snippet, meander, speculation, awe, uncertainty, delight, and, instead of confidence, a questioning concern. The over- riding feature of co-evolutionary histories, from, say, Eucalyptus: A Novel to The Secret Life of Trees: How They Live and Why They Matter, is the displacement of the confi- dent anthropocentric drive to objectify and control nature that is to a large extent brought about through a controlled written discourse. With recent scientific discoveries - such as those announced by the Human Genome Project, revealing that, contrary to expectation, the number of human genes was not outstandingly high, but rather "only one third greater than that of the simple roundworm C. elegans " (Claverie 1255-57) - the evidence for and emphasis on the co-evolution, commonality, and interdependence of species is now overwhelming. As Owain Jones and Paul Cloke have explained in Tree Culture: The Place of Trees and Trees in their Place, it is not that trees, or any other species, are "like" humans, as such, but rather that they nonetheless "possess very significant forms of active agency, which have usually been assumed to exist only in the human realm" (49). Co-evolu- tionary histories, although multiple in mode and method, have this at their core: "Humans are actors in stories and processes which they did not start and will not fin- ish" (Jones and Cloke 55). The reintegration of those repressed aspects into narratives has a correlation with the reinstatement of humans within a web or family of life forms rather than as their controller, collector, or curator. There is no going back to Anon (this is not simply about nostalgia), but what is called for is a more appropriate acknowledgment of the interdependency of life forms and, in our histories, of our uncertainties (and wonderment). In fact, for some this inclusiveness would extend beyond the familiar species of the "natural world." For the "feminist technoscientist" Donna Haraway, an interdependent familial network would include patented life forms such as cyborgs, computer-mediated representations, genetic modifications, and other "artifactual chimeras" (7). These are contemporary phenomena about which Woolf, Abram, and Bail have nothing to say (although they are within Michael Pollan's scope). And yet, Haraway s inclusiveness and sense of</page><page sequence="17">Shelley Saguaro 55 inter-relationships are familiar: "I insist that social relationships include nonhumans as well as humans as socially [. . .] active partners. All that is unhuman is not un-kind, outside kinship, outside the orders of signification, excluded from trading in signs and wonders" (8). Writing in 1997, Haraway anticipates what has become even more acute as the twenty-first century unfolds, with second millennium "narratives of disasters in the technical and popular cultures of technoscience" (44). She cautions that "we might profitably learn to doubt our fears and uncertainties of disasters as much as our dreams of progress" but asserts that "changing the stories, in both material and semi- otic senses, is a modest intervention worth making" (44-^5). Despite her laboratory focus, Haraway s own narrative method when "changing the stories" is not so unlike those of Woolf s out-of-doors troubador or Bail's storyteller amidst the trees, and it has many features in common with those narratives discussed here as "co -evolution- ary histories." As George Myerson describes, Haraway s narrative style "is full of echoes and linkages, repetitions and returns. There are academic footnotes and plenty of references to fellow scholars and experts. But the voice is fluid. [. . .] In some ways, Modest Witness is like a novel and Haraway does draw as much upon fiction as upon academic sources" (8). It is this - a new poetics - that is now being made manifest in a wide range of writing from early in the first decade of the twenty-first century. That new poetics responds variously to notions of "interrelationship" and "co-evolution" and acknowledges, amidst the crises and concerns, that a new epoch will, and must, have new kinship stories to tell.
