<plain_text><page sequence="1">Paul Lippert* ET CETERA? A fortieth short time anniversary ago I had issue the of Et privilege cetera which of helping was a collection to put together of reprints the fortieth anniversary issue of Et cetera , which was a collection of reprints from the journal's first twenty years of publication. Reading through the back issues, I got a fair sampling of the thoughts of a wide range of writers on general semantics. I was also able to further my understanding of the his- tory of general semantics as an intellectual movement. Most apparent to me in my search through the scores of articles running from 1943 until the present was the persistence of our authors in applying general semantics principles to the changing trends in society. Through cold war, political and cultural upheaval, crisis in education, new conceptuali- zations of selfhood, the pages of Et cetera continuously brought the maps of general semantics close to a shifting, surprising, and at times, scary reality. In our most recent period of publication, the years of Neil Postman's editor- ship, we have taken on the challenge of the greatest upheaval in the sym- bolic environment that our culture has yet experienced: the advent of elec- tronic media. This move has thrust Et cetera into a very important position within the extremely popular and extremely relevant new discipline of mass media research. In addition to bringing a new direction to general semantics, the move comes at a crucial time in the history of the other disciplines as well. When mass communication began to develop as a discipline back in the thirties and forties, it was conceived by many as a project with significance well beyond its own boundaries. More than a mere contemporary adjunct of the older mainstream social disciplines, it was planned to be a workshop for the development of a truly scientific methodology for the social sciences in general. Essentially by trying to adapt the methods of the hard sciences to the study of social processes, this methodology would be used to discover the "laws" of human social behavior. At the same time, researchers in the field began seeking ways of finding the "effects" of mass media along with their causative properties. But as time went on it became increasingly apparent that people are not like orbiting planets or chemically reacting molecules, and that the original *Paul Lippert is Assistant Professor of Speech Communication at East Stroudsburg Univer- sity and Managing Editor of Et cetera. 100</page><page sequence="2">Et Cetera? 101 plan of research was going nowhere. After tens of thousands of studies of such subjects as the effects of televised violence on the behavior of children, we now know that certain people may be influenced by media in some ways, some of the time, under some circumstances, but only if they feel like it (and, in any case, that the methodology needs refining and further research is needed. Amen.). Yet although research in the field has at times tended toward the ridicu- lous, there is no sign of a decline in activity. In fact, everyone seems to want to get into the act, with communication departments springing up and growing not only in the United States but abroad as well. This serves as per- haps the best testimony that although research has been dull and unproduc- tive, the issues arising from the subject are on the minds of many and are too important to leave untreated. The shortcoming of mass communication research can be characterized briefly as a mechanistic approach toward the communication process which fails to take into account the unique qualities of human symboling behaviors. For it is through symbols that we think consciously and act upon free deci- sions by means of reasoning, not causation. And it is also within this sym- boling process, I might add, that so many of our troubles get started. Well, how we use symbols to think and act is just what general semantics is all about. And when over two decades ago, Marshall McLuhan entered the mass communication field with the slogan "The Medium is the Mes- sage," the phrase should rightfully have served as a call to arms for general semanticists who were greatly needed in a difficult battle of ideas. For McLuhan's insights were resisted for years and are only recently beginning to have a revolutionary impact on the discipline. Throughout this intellectual ferment, I am proud to say, Et cetera has been the only journal to consistently address mass media issues from a general semantics point of view. Although, if you take a look at a recent issue of Journal of Communication, you will find that they are now talking more like us. But this is not enough. I believe that we have the opportunity and should make it our goal to make Et cetera not just a general semantics journal that addresses media issues, but also a media journal that brings people to general semantics. In expanding our frontiers fully to take on the new electronic environment as part of our subject matter, we will be applying general semantics to a broader and newer range of phenomena than ever before. But as we enrich the study of this environment with our ideas, we must also be willing to learn from our experience in this new area. Based upon my own experience, I would like to suggest five areas which I believe the study of the electronic media environment should bring us to address with regard to the theoretical develop- ment of general semantics. The first area that I would like to suggest is what I would like to call the semantics of orality and literacy. This subject deals with the differences in</page><page sequence="3">102 Et cetera â€¢ SPRING 1986 thought between groups of people whose use of language is only through speech and those who make use of both speech and writing. Of the five areas that I am suggesting, this is perhaps the one that the present body of thought in general semantics is best equipped to deal with and has so far done the most to address. This is because orality-literacy contrasts stem primarily from different uses of language and because many of the semantic problems of reification, abstraction, and Aristotelianism can be seen as particularly literate language biases. When the spoken word, which is an event taking place between specific individuals in a concrete context, is reduced to a visual mark on a solid substance, it becomes a thing and can come to take on more of a life of its own. Making words into things in this way greatly unleashes the abstraction process, as an ever-larger quantity of words is built up in books, leaving their contexts far behind. When developed in the black-and-white world of writing, logic becomes detached from the rich ambiguity of ever- changing reality and is pinned down in neat equations, airtight categories, and unchanging absolute statements. But all of this has been with us since at least the time of Plato's attack on the poets, although it has taken until the age of Korzybski to launch an ade- quate counterattack. Perhaps it was necessary for the culture of typography, which further developed the split between oral and literate noetics, to come to its full flowering before a significant reaction could take place. Just why a Korzybski came along when he did is an interesting question in the history of thought. But in the meantime quite a few other things have been going on to undermine the literate thought bias which may be more pervasive than Korzybski's ideas and which are not necessarily so contribu- tory to semantic sanity. These events are more pervasive because, unlike general semantics and other non-aristotelian philosophies which are deliber- ately articulated discourses meant to be consciously thought about and crit- ically evaluated, they are environments, which generally go unnoticed, and which set the conditions for thought rather than being thought about them- selves. They hamper the quest for semantic sanity because while dissolving many literate biases they set up mischievous biases all their own. I am referring, of course, to the doings of television and its kindred media which are now in the process of setting up a semantic environment which is shaping language to its own proclivities. It is an environment with many of the characteristics of orality, but which is not purely oral. For whereas the public discourse disseminated daily over electronic media has the seeming freshness of oral dialogue, it is pre-programmed with written scripting. What is produced through this process of preplanning oral spontaneity through writing has been called "secondary orality." It is a situation similar to that which existed in classical times when so much of the writing was done to prepare for oral recitation and debate before non-literate audiences. As people today receive more and more of their important information through the elec- tronically spoken word and become increasingly unfamiliar with the style</page><page sequence="4">Et Cetera? 103 of discourse peculiar to print, society is bound to fall prey to a whole new and different set of semantic problems. And although print biases will prob- ably not become extinct for some time to come, general semantics will have to supplement the principles it has developed in dealing with the literate mentality with new ones which will address the emerging problems of this secondary orality. But this is only the tip of the electronic iceberg. For what I have been talking about so far has kept us safely within the bounds of our most familiar mode of symbolic expression: language. Yet many who are concerned with the shift in our semantic environment following on the heels of the elec- tronic revolution believe that the greatest changes involve not a transforma- tion of the form of language use but a diminishing of the very role that lan- guage itself plays within the culture. With radio and other audio media dealing primarily in music, and visual media using images, music, and sound effects, at the expense of even spoken language, a great part of our public discourse is being conducted in symbolic forms which are less amenable to conscious reasoning and whose semantics have barely begun to be studied. As a group, these are what the late Susanne Langer called presentational or non-discursive forms -a class long dismissed by neo-positivist philosophers with high hopes for language as the sole vehicle for the expression of any real thought beyond "the barking of dogs." Langer 's lifelong work on the significance of these forms in human thought deserves consideration by general semanticists not only for its implications about art and the mentality involved in basic perception, but because our society is coming to be domi- nated by media which are primarily presentational. For mathematicians, scientists, and even philosophers of an earlier age, it may have been possible to ignore these forms, so long as one steered clear of questions involving such supposedly irrational subjects as art and religion. But today things are different. Political discourse is conducted in iconic images. Economic discourse is accompanied by music. Nuclear particle acceleration is explained by the image of a man riding on a bicycle. The alphabet is taught by animated letters which dance across the television screen. As the second area that I would like to suggest for new general semantics research, we need to investigate not only the inherent properties of presentational forms but the semantic consequences of their widescale use in modes of discourse which have traditionally been dominated by lan- guage. The third area that I would like to suggest for new research in general semantics arises as an indirect consequence of the bias toward presentational forms in our media environment. It has always been true that human artifacts, among them commodities, have the tendency to take on symbolic as well as practical values. A sword can come to symbolize authority. Clothes can signify social status. Architecture can be used to express a conception of the cosmos. But today this tendency to grant physical things symbolic status has</page><page sequence="5">104 Et cetera â€¢ SPRING 1986 been tremendously amplified. The common objects found in our daily lives supply the imagery which functions as the vocabulary of mass media dis- course. And when narrative forsakes words for these images, it is inevitable that the objects that these images represent will increasingly be seen as part of the discourse. Add to this the commercial imperative to endow mundane commodities with sexual, anthropomorphic, mystical, and status-conferring qualities, and we approach a situation where the things that we buy and sur- round ourselves with are more symbol than technology. And although it can be argued that beyond the bare requirements of physiological survival humankind's needs are for the most part at once symbolic and impractical, this is the first time in history that the production process of material goods has so consciously and systematically been driven forward by a mythic dream- world composed of images and music. As general semanticists, we need to assess this symbolification of our mate- rial lives, to make others more aware of it, and to help them to cope with it in a way that enhances their power and freedom to define the things around them in ways that they find productive. The fourth area that I would like to suggest for new research in general semantics is one that has already been dealt with somewhat, though prescrip- tively and pessimistically rather than descriptively and in an open-minded fashion. I am referring to the twin worlds of myth and ritual, which, with the rise of logic and empirical science to positions of supreme authority in the print-dominated culture, have been repressed and supposedly driven from the realm of serious thought. Whereas myth was once seen to represent the deepest form of human truth, it has in the modern world come to be seen as synonymous with misconception, superstition, and outright lie. Oper- ating under the unconscious influence of its own implicit myths, among them the myth of the objectivity of scientific knowledge, the forces of rational thought have approached myth as a type of disease to be eradicated. But rather than disappearing, myth has merely gone underground, resurfacing in liter- ature, art, and in the fabric of metaphor out of which our scientific vestments are tailored. For as work in general semantics tells us, all human knowledge is grounded upon sensations in our nervous systems, upon a certain sub- jectivity or "to me-ness." Science can strive to bring a level of intersubjec- tivity to our knowledge. But since all experience has a certain component of intensionality to it, the most objective knowledge we can produce will inevitably bear the stamp of "to us-ness." It is this "to us-ness" of our knowl- edge that myth makes explicit. Though inevitable, it is nothing to be feared unless it is ignored or denied. In feet it can be argued that knowledge is objec- tive only when its subjective aspects are identified and considered as part of it. If it was unwise to ignore or deny the omnipresence of myth in systems of knowledge during the age of print, it is ridiculous to do so in the age of electronic media. For regardless of what one might think about particular</page><page sequence="6">Et Cetera? 105 myths or about myth itself, it is an undeniable fact that mythic styles of expression and thought are resurfacing in our culture on a grand scale. On MTV youths gaze upon Olympian rock stars enacting sagas of social iden- tity, self-expression, and personal potency. In television commercials con- sumers are presented with parables of the technologically correct means of dealing with the problems of daily life. Television dramas provide us with perhaps the most comprehensive guide to the mores and folkways of our cul- ture. The problems of our national dignity are symbolized through the vehicle of a Herculean god named Rambo. Now, although I have asserted and would argue that myth cannot be abolished -made to disappear in a puff of logic, if you will -I think most would agree that a culture is by no means stuck with any particular set of myths, that a culture's myths change from time to time to meet changing circumstances and changing human goals. Beginning with an investigation of the semantic process by which particular mythological systems arise and evolve, I believe general semanticists should move on to explore the possi- bility of helping to make this process more subject to human consciousness, criticism, and control. We must be open to the possibility, however, that this quest may have its limits. As the last area that I would like to suggest for further research in general semantics, I would like to refer you to the methodological controversy going on in mass communication research that I mentioned earlier. As I said before, classical mass communication research has been traditionally envisioned as a workshop for the development of methodologies for all of the social sciences. But knowing what we do about the symboling behavior of humans, I believe we must confront this research project with the question: Can there really ever be a science of human behavior in the sense that physics or chemistry are sciences? Are there laws to human behavior? Is there causation in human affairs? These questions are more than academic. For how they are answered, par- ticularly within the field of mass communication research, will play a large part in how the masses of people in our society will be addressed by those who control the media: whether they will be addressed as cogs to be manipu- lated or as individuals making free choices. Perhaps more important, it will affect the way we regard ourselves. Do we merely react as determined by the social forces which condition us? Or do our symbol-using capacities enable us to do more? Well, these suggestions ought to keep us busy at least until the next con- ference, and I suppose that other people may have a few of their own. But the most important thing to stress is that we must use Et cetera as well as the other resources available to us to keep general semantics open to new ideas, new areas of work, and new growth. For if we can at least do this, though we may never do away with semantic insanity, the effort will have been worthwhile.</page></plain_text>
