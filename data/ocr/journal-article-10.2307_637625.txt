In 43 M reads dvovo'dpov 7i-a:' av60ovotpoduas (Porson) is almost universally adopted.z However, dvOovodtov -ra (Tucker) is printed in the current Oxford text (I955).3 Porson's emendation was attacked by Tucker on various grounds: (I) it was palaeographically unsatisfactory, (2) it added an otiose epithet to 7poydvov flods but left Fvw unqualified, (3) it involved a 'scarcely Greek' use of the participle, and (4) it coined a form in -votdwo having the unique sense 'graze' instead of 'handle'. My purpose is to defend dvOovotpodaas as the true reading and to explore its contextual significance. I begin by taking Tucker's objections in order. I. dvOovoptov'eas is not difficult to justify palaeographically. The reading of M (where the superscribed dots indicate deletion of the sigma)4 may be T ascribed to a previous ANOONOMOYCAC, the variant arising, and being ultimately preferred, through the unusualness of the verb &amp;dv0ovop'w, which would have encouraged the word-division &amp;dvovo'pov ais.s 2. By Tucker's criterion of relevance the epithet in (e.g.) olarpo8dvov flods (Supp. I6-I 7) is otiose. His supplementary point as to balance of epithets is also of doubtful validity; this (unfinished) sentence is not characterized by sym- metrical structure. Nor is the relevance of the description to lo (or Epaphos) merely a stylistic question: it will be discussed more fully below. 3. dv6OvoPvooasa can only be quasi-adjectival, characterizing Io qua flos, the form in which she is usually visualized in the play.6 The use of the participle, often co-ordinate with an adjective, to denote a permanent characteristic, is of frequent occurrence in predicative expressions, as, for example, Supp. 750 o0Adpo- VES 8K KELVL, ooAot T-L8ES / &amp;vcavyvO"LS ..pE..v.

The verb v6Oovo&amp;dw, derived from av0ovdtpos (itself attested only at Supp. 539) and perhaps an Aeschylean coinage,4 bears a meaning associated not, indeed, with other compounds in -volE'o, but with vEpw, or rather vILopaL. Comparable is the use of (e.g.) dv6Ooopow, from av0o0o'pos, by Theaetetus (A.P. Io. I6. 2) in the unparalleled sense (guaranteed by the context) of 'produce flowers'. This goes back to 0cpw; it is not, according to LSJ, attested for Oopow. Licence of this type is not un-Aeschylean. The present case would have similarities with the unique use of Evvopos not as 'lawful', 'law-abiding', but as equivalent to E"VOLKO, in Supp. 565 po7r-o 8', oCY y is r' ~av EvvotLoL, of which it has been remarked: 'Abusio facta est derivando novam notionem ab alio eiusdem originis vocabulo, sc. a verbo vEpEaL0a, quod valet incolere, vel a substantivo vopo'L, quod notat sedem, domicilium.'s An adequate example of the 'analogous verb' required by Tucker does, moreover, exist in Pfovvot~'w = 'pasture cattle', found at Str. 13. I. 7, where Edovv6dLE paraphrases II. 15. 547 9o0.s9 /o'aKf'. None of Tucker's observations is, therefore, decisive against the reading dvOovotpotas: but together they may conduce to a slight preference for his own dvovodtov --is on the ground of its comparative simplicity. Palaeographically it is straightforward enough: assimilation of dvOovo'tov to the genitive of the next words will have been followed by intrusion of a final a (deleted when the error was noticed) through minuscule 7/ra7 corruption.6 The striking phrase wytv dvOovdwov is comparable, in its juxtaposition of the human-divine and the animal,7 to the preceding A ~ov rd'pnv and the following rrpoydvov 3o ds.8 It does, however, obscure the notional antithesis which underlies the chiastic arrangement d ~ov rTw'P7CV. . . Mv 7'... f.ods, paraphrased by Tucker as 'the calf, though son of Zeus ... the human being, though son of the cow'.9 Since either reading is admissible, it is desirable to decide the question to whom, Epaphos or lo, the description 'flower-browsing' is (stylistic considera- tions apart) more appropriate.

Assuming that the epithet is applied to Epaphos, Rose suggests that it may be merely 'ornamental': 'it seems possible that Aesch. is picturing Io in her cow-form producing such offspring as a cow might have'-a looseness surely out of place in this direct and earnest appeal to the actual person. Alternatively, Epaphos may be envisaged as a bull and identified with the Egyptian Apis.z Aeschylus implies this identification in two amphibolical passages in the play: 117 = 128 Ar1'av floivvy (= (i) 'hilly Apia', (ii) 'cow country of Apis'), 776 1 , y oya Ov... /.. o ../ . . . o Io w yev Ana gowo'.; (with similar double meaning).3 But though Epaphos is, to produce a paradox, called a 7rcdprs here and in 314, he is never pictured, realistically or 'orna- mentally', as pursuing bovine activities: the vivid description 'flower-browsing' would stand by itself. Nor have I found such a description attached to him outside Aeschylus. Io's exploits in cow-form constitute, on the other hand, a prominent motif in the Supplices.4 Most notably, a lyrical narration of her flight from Argos (538 ff.) opens with a compressed but unambiguous allusion to her browsing on flowers under her herdsman's supervision: 7raAadv 8' Elg t'Xvos ptLE rav, / pLar'pos cvOovdpovs E'7T7Twds, / AEtpva flov'xAov, EVGEV 'I6 K7rA. Moreover, the antistrophe which follows our present passage (49 ff.) runs: vr' EmAf apELa, / VVV EV 7TOOVopoLS pa-rpog apXataaS rroSo T / Tcov pO pOE TdYoWY ,v vaaatEva KTA. Here 7TroLovopoLs has the appearance, supported by the parallelism of the openings, of repeating in less specific manner the content of an earlier dv0ovotPodeas in 43. The assumption is not incompatible with the distinction already noticed between a6vOa and vol-i as types of fodder. The new epithet is applied not to Io herself but to the present scene of her former pastures; rolr) functions here as an inclusive term, as in, e.g., II. 14- 347 TOLUL 8' 57I xO&amp;v 8ga eWEv vEyo01Aa roliqv, / Awrdv 0' .p..'Evra 8IU KpOKOV 778' vaKLOV K7T.5 These two passages strongly support attribution of the epithet to lo, and this is, furthermore, appropriate to, if not absolutely required by, the imagery of the context itself. From early on in the play the Danaids identify themselves with their ancestress, who was like them subjected to erotic persecution and forced to flee from her country.6 This identification emerges first in the opening lyrics, 40 ff., where it is introduced by means of a carefully worked-out transition.7 In 43, if dvOovopoodIaa is read, Io is described as 'flower-browsing'. In the antistrophe the allusion (50 roLov 'pots) shifts to the setting of Io's past I It is suggestive that Nemea, where Io grazed (Luc. D. Deor. 3) was said by some to be named from the browsing of Hera's sacred cattle (refs. in. R.-E. xxxii. 2313, s.v. ; cf. A. B. Cook, Zeus, i [I9x4], p. 446). 2 Cf. Hdt. 2. 38, 2. 153, 3. 27-28, R.-E. v. 2709, s.v. 3 See Murray, Motifoflo, pp. 24, 27. The concealed meaning could be 'bull country': the word floiE is applied exclusively to Io (07, 44, 170o, 275, 299, 300oo, 303, 306, 314, 569), but &amp;Aoeal4otov in 855 would refer more suitably to Epaphos than to Io.

At length the Danaids enlarge on their own wretchedness and picture themselves in Io's place:' 73 yOESvd S' dvOsle opta -they too feed on flowers, though theirs are flowers of grief.z If cv6ovdtpov -is is read, dvOpEldopta implies that the Danaids identify themselves with Epaphos, or, if -rotovJOLoLs is not to be redundant, with Epaphos and Io. Either alterna- tive dissipates all the image's force, for the Danaids' persecution, flight, and presence in Argos have no analogy in Epaphos' career. Elsewhere they associate him with themselves only as also being of the race of Io and Zeus (170-2, 275).3 The internal evidence alone thus establishes with sufficient clarity the superiority of Porson's &amp;v6ovouovuas: it remains only to consider how far the context can be illuminated from sources outside the play. In the classical period testimony to Io's flowery diet is slight and uncertain. Aeschylus himself has Io ignore it in the Prometheus, perhaps because the idea would be grotesque when Io was herself present to view in the form of a horned but otherwise human biped.4 A vestige of the motif may appear in Bacchylides' description of Io's destination as the 'flowery Nile' (18. 39 trap' dv6BEL[wEa / Nehov a'KETr' o['UTrpo7rAl / 'Id6). The mention of flowers in the dramatist Chaere- mon's 'Ic6 (Fr. 9) cannot be specially significant, as his fondness for them makes him mention them in many plays.s However, it is suggestive that an Attic red-figure hydria of the early fifth century shows the heifer Io in motion with flowers sprouting beneath her, and Argos, pursued by Hermes, at her side: the setting is surely Io's dvOovdpot ~ rrwal (Supp. 539).6 In the Roman poets Io's browsing often features in the story, but flowers are not mentioned and the emphasis is on the disagreeableness of her unfamiliar sustenance: Licinius Calvus Fr. 9 Morel ap. Serv. ad Virg. E. 6. 47 a virgo infelix, herbis pasceris amaris! Prop. 2. 33. I I a quotiens quernis laesisti frondibus ora, / man- disti et stabulis arbuta pasta tuis!, Ov. Her. 14. 96, Met. i. 632; N.B. Val. Fl. 4. 379. This treatment perhaps derives from the 'lo60s &amp;!StS of Callimachus and other Hellenistic poems.7 It is only from still later sources that real light is thrown on the Aeschylean context. A late rhetorician, in a passage first quoted in this connexion by Headlam,8 relates that after Io's metamorphosis flowers sprouted from the earth for her to feed on: Severus ap. Walz, Rhetores Graeci, i. 537 rclqcaa 7r 7^y T)V T7 iJt E'pWtLzV)v 4vO&amp;S aC KE T ^j rfot v E"CrOat.

It is reasonable to conclude, as Headlam did, that this detail is traditional and lies behind the Aeschylean allusions: the long interval of silence is not without parallel.9 Cf.

Hipp. 1425-7. But the force of the suffix -Lw is imprecise and varies according to context (cf. Fraenkel on Ag. 286, 960): Aeschylus chooses a word which continues the idea of divOovotdw but avoids the grotes- queness of describing humans as 'browsing'. Cf.

WHITTLE Accordingly, since Io's name is not directly revealed until Supp. I62 (Paley is surely right in seeing a concealed allusion to it in 69 'Iaovlotau), JvOovowodkaas serves not merely as a picturesque description but also as a stage in a cumula- tive process of identification (with which one might compare, though it is in a dramatic, not lyrical, context, the gradual disclosure in the Prometheus of the god's identity which culminates in the utterance of his name at Pr. 66). This process begins with the first mention of Io, 16 7 s or? -po6dvov / flods, where her identity is similarly indicated by a distinctive epithet: cf. Pr. 589 rrVs ' oi KAVXC M-! OcTTPpo&amp;v ToV KOp'S ' 7T . 'I9vaXEtag...; S. El. 5 T7S ot1'TporA7)yos Auaos 'Ivdxov Kdpql, also A. Supp. 573, Pr. 681. But dvOovotoduaas may even constitute a precise allusion to Io's name, which fuller quotation of a context cited earlier shows to have been associated, despite the different quantity of the iota, with the 'ov, which, in this account, constituted her special food: Severus ap. Walz, Rhetores Graeci, i. 537 (also ap. A. Wester- mann, Mythographi (1843), P. 373): rrEpl 'lob .

It has also received consideration from philologists in modern times.' If an etymological link between Io's name and the bov figured in the story of her browsing as it was known to Aeschylus, he was surely referring to this in JvOovopLo aaas-though it is conceivable that the etymology current in his time derived the name from the flower (not the reverse), as in the case of Iamos, who was named after the i'a among which he lay as a baby.2 It is customary in such etymological allusions for the name itself to be included,3 as in A. Supp. 287 KpEO%%dpov at avas-, an analogous mention of idiosyncratic diet which hints at a traditional derivation of 4itabdv from alpha privative + ea.4 But in which Tereus becomes a hawk, not a hoopoe, occurs in Aeschylus (Supp. 62) for the first time, but does not reappear for many centuries: Hyginus Fab. 45. 5, Deme- trius Hieracosophium II (ap. Aeliani De Animalium Natura ed. R. Hercher (I866), ii. 333 ff.), Pseudo-Eutecnius Paraphrasis Oppiani (vel Dionysii) Ixeuticorum I. 4 (ap. Oppiani De Venatione etc. ed. J. G. Schneider [1776], pp. I7 ff.) ; hints of it occur in Ach. Tat. 5- 3- 3 ff. (see E. Oder, Rh. M. xliii [ 888], 547) and Serv. ad Virg. E. 6. 78 (see G. Mihailov, Annuaire de l'Universit! de Sofia, 1. 2 [1955] (Facult des Lettres), 167). An obscure expression in a tragic fragment (A. Fr. 304- 4-5= S. Fr. 58x. 4-5) may be an attempt to reconcile the hawk and hoopoe versions. See R.-E. ix. 1740, s.v. Io (Eitrem citing Fick-Bechtel), ii. 797-8, s.v. Argos (Wer- nicke, who is followed by Durrbach ap. Daremberg-Saglio Dictionnaire des antiquitis, iii. 568, s.v. Io). 2 Pi. 0. 6. 53-57, a passage cited, as well as that of Severus, by Headlam in the manu- script notes in his interleaved copies of Wecklein's edition of Aeschylus; this suggests that Headlam may have entertained the possibility that Aeschylus was etymologizing.

It is to this less explicit type ofetymologizing that dv6ovojuoaruas may perhaps belong.

'IM), id', or i'douat is present in 162, it need amount to no more than a verbal jingles and does not exclude the possibility of earlier etymologiz- ing on different lines.6 The etymology hinted for 'MI by ivOovojoauas- would have no pervasive significance; contrast the emphatic explanation of Epaphos' name found in 45-47, which relates to a dominant motif in the drama.7 The presence of such an allusion here must, however, remain no more than a possibility. Severus' version of the legend may, after all, amount merely to an ingenious fusing of the flower-browsing motif with an unconnected and perhaps late etymology of Io's name. But, etymologizing apart, the richness of association contained in av6ovotzov-as- as a description of Io is sufficiently evident. This is the true reading in Supp. 43 and should no longer be excluded from the Oxford text.

E. Or. 1426 I(pvylotro vdolots-: but what is there specifically Hellenic in the sentence's content? Emendation to vojlotut (for the plural cf. h.Ven. 78, 169, h.Merc. 492, E. Cyc. 61) eliminates such problems and enriches the sense. NELAoOEp? in 71 now has the effect of contrasting the Nile, whence the Danaids have fled, with the place where they seek refuge, the 'pastures' of Greece (cf. E. Rh. 477 vo~dv cv 'EAAd3os-, S. O.C. Io6i). The force of the nightingale comparison emerges clearly, for vouoFta suggests a bird's habitat (cf. Ar. Av. 239) and refers back to 760dewv in 64: cf. E. Fr. 636. 7 KAhLTv q'OGr TE Kaia Vojxv 0fltov (sc. the dAtalETro), also II. 6. 5II, 15. 268. The Danaids see themselves as resembling the nightingale not merely in their 'fondness for lament' (68) but also in their reason for it, enforced exile from their native haunts. At the same time voj1ao^t aids in reintroducing the Io theme of 40 f., which the nightingale digression has temporarily interrupted. Io's 'pasturing' on flowers, twice alluded to, in dv6ovojloaruas- (43) and 7rotovdoots- (50), has been established as a motif by the otherwise gratuitous continuation of idea and expression in yatovd"1cotut (54).5 The image is now revived in voljuotc and applied figuratively to the Danaids: they picture themselves as 'devouring cheek and heart'6 and as 'cropping flowers of grief'.7 Thus vo oorr, in producing a tem- porary synthesis of the nightingale and Io images, serves simultaneously to terminate the one and to reactivate the other. The combination 'Iaovtou volotirt succinctly recalls and paraphrases the earlier expression E'v TOCovdl0ots / pUa-rp'S dpXalas ro' 7TOL(50-5 ). The epithet is not merely (though appropriate enough as such) a foreigner's synonym for 'Greek',8 but functions also as a possessive adjective formed from 'Ic6, like 'Idvwos in I Cf. A. Ag. I4142, 1 153, Ar. Av. 21o, Ra. 684. One may note here that, contrary to Paley's surmise, the emendation dc6ovtowat (Pearson, or Spanheim) has no palaeo- graphical basis: the traces visible in Ros- tagno's facsimile of M suggest merely that the scribe first wrote lovtotaL, then erased the first letter and substituted la-, cf. A. Pers. 897. 2 Apart from the apparent inconsistency with I18= 129 (on which see Shepphard, C.Q.v [1911 ], 226), the hypothetical augur's mistake becomes less comprehensible if the supposed nightingale-voice is avowedly singing in his own tongue (N.B. Hdt. 2. 56-57). In 234 ff. Pelasgos, though much struck by the Danaids' exotic appearance, ignores the possibility of a language barrier (cf. esp. 245). If they were to be visualized as conversing in Greek, it must have been mentioned and related to their claim of Argive ancestry. N.B. also 973 JAAoOpdo'Ls. 3 Cf.

Should it be the case that dv6ovotokaasa in 43 alludes to an etymological connexion of Io's name with the t'a on which she is said to have browsed, 'Iaoviotat has also the connotation 'full of 'a' (a paronomasia attested in Nic.
