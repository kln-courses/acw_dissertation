<plain_text><page sequence="1">RESULTS OF SOVIET INVESTIGATIONS IN SIBERIA, 1940-1941 By HENRY FIELD AND EUGENE PROSTOV THE following report' reveals the application of anthropological data to the problem of the origin of the peoples of northwestern Siberia. 1. No Mousterian sites are as yet known from Siberia. Upper Paleolithic sites have been discovered in the Altai Mountains, near Tomsk, in the upper part of the Yenisei Valley, in the Angara Valley and in Trans-Baikalia. Human finds, however, have been very few. The origin and the racial types of the popu- lations during the Paleolithic period in western and eastern Siberia can not as yet be determined. The oldest anthropological objects from the Altai and Minusinsk, attrib- uted to about 2,000 B.C. and belonging to the period of the Afanas'evo culture are characterized by pronounced traits of the Europoid peoples. Twenty-four skulls from Afanas'evo sites possess similar characters. In addition to such Europoid traits as a prominent nose and an orthognathous, relatively short and unflattened face,'the Afanas'evo skulls have an elongated form and are massive. The latter is expressed in a greater facial breadth, a greater slant of the forehead, and in highly developed supraorbital crests. This combination of characters is unknown among the modern European races but occurs in the Upper Paleolithic period. The closest analogy to the Afanas'evo skulls is offered by the Cr6-Magnon type of western Europe. Since all Afanas'evo skulls belong to this type with no Mongoloid admixture, it is most probable that the ancient inhabitants of western Siberia belonged to this type. The first explanation is that the Afanas'evo people migrated into western Siberia and eliminated the autochthons. The second possibility is that the Afanas'evo type resembled or was connected closely with that of the more ancient populations. At that particular stage of historical development it is difficult to under- stand in what manner on such extensive a territory as the steppes of western Siberia there should have occurred such a complete displacement of a people by later invaders. It is far more plausible that the most ancient populations of the steppe belt of western Siberia down to the Minusinsk region originated from and belonged anthropologically to the Cr6-Magnon type of western Europe. The situation is completely different in eastern Siberia. Several dozen well- preserved Mongoloid skeletons and skulls from Neolithic burials of the Lake Baikal area were entirely different from those of western Siberia. A. P. Oklad- 1 G. F. Debets, Problema zaseleniu Severo-Zapadnol Sibiri po dannym paleoanthropologii: The problem of early settling of northwestern Siberia on the basis of paleoanthropological data (Kratkie Soobshchenifia No. 9, Moscow, 1941), pp. 14-18. 388</page><page sequence="2">FIELD AND PROSTOV] SOVIET INVESTIGATIONS IN SIBERIA 389 nikov stated that this type is also present among the Tungus of Lake Baikal. In addition to the Huns, this type extends west down to and includes Hungary. A slight Europoid admixture observed among the Baikalian type does not change the picture, and the populations of this area should be considered as belonging to the Mongoloid Race. There are no reasons to suppose that these populations of the Baikal region were not descended from the oldest popula- tions of this area, and Debets considers it possible that the entire Baikal area was populated by Mongoloids since a very early period. The problem of the most ancient population of western Siberia is far more complex. Only a small amount of data regarding the fossil man in this area is available. Some curious conclusions can be made on the basis of these finds. Firstly, we have the small series of skulls belonging to the Krasnoiarsk Eneo- lithic culture, apparently contemporaneous with the Andronovo and Karasuk culture, from Bazaikha and Perevozania near Krasnoiarsk. In contradistinc- tion to the Afanas'evo (southern steppe) skulls these are characterized by fairly well-expressed Mongoloid traits. While it is true that these can not be identified with the Baikal Neolithic peoples, because of the small amount of data from Krasnoiarsk, and the fact that we have to deal with the second order of differences, necessitating further statistical materials to establish the fact, a general conclusion yet can be made that the Neolithic population of the Yenisei Valley near Krasnoiarsk belonged to the Mongoloid type at a fairly distant period, while the Europoid racial type predominated in the steppes to the south. A great antiquity of this Krasnoiarsk type is suggested by the finding of a skull fragment at the Paleolithic site of Afontovo II near Krasnoiarsk by the members of the XVII International Geological Congress in 1937. In spite of the small size of the fragment, consisting of the frontal bone with a portion of the nasion, there is no doubt as to its Mongoloid char- acter. The height of the nasion corresponds to the lowest limit of the variation observed in children's skulls of the Chukchis. Such a degree of nasion flatness is only seldom observed among the modern Mongoloids and is never known among the Europoids, even in the case of the newborn. Thus it appears that the populations of the Yenisei Valley belonged to the Europoid type near the Minusinsk depression, and to the Mongoloid further downstream. It is here, consequently, that we have the dividing area between the Mongoloid region of Central Asia and that of the forest belt of western Siberia. Debets assumes, therefore, that the forest belt of western Siberia was in- habited not along the rivers from the south but rather from the east. The forest belt of western Siberia is now populated by racial types transitional between the Europoid and Mongoloid races. During 1939 in the Tym and Vakh valleys and in the area lying between the Ob and Yenisei valleys the Expedition found a strong Europoid admixture. This cannot be explained by mestization with</page><page sequence="3">390 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 44, 1942 Russian traders since it is so much stronger than among the Tungus and other tribes having a comparable amount of intercourse with the Russians, and also because of the extremely isolated character of the Tym and Vakh valleys. The problems arising in connection with the origin of this mixed Europoid- Mongoloid type are complicated by the lack of paleoanthropological materials from this part of western Siberia. While the data regarding the modern population of this area furnish the starting point of the investigation, the distribution in time of various elements present in modern material requires confirmation. At the same time we have some anthropological materials from the forest belt of eastern Europe. A slight but distinct admixture of Mongoloid traits was established by E. V. Zhirov in the case of the skeletal materials from Olenil Ostrov on Lake Onega. These conclusions were verified by A. IA. Briusov from skeletal material obtained from the Neolithic cemetery at the same site. The Mongoloid element, form- ing part of the Neolithic populations of northern Russia, could only have been of eastern origin. Southern and eastern zones of Europe were settled by Europoid types. The Mongoloid admixture, present as far as the Baltic coun- tries and possibly as far as Scandinavia, could have come only from western Siberia and through the Urals. This explains the presence of Mongoloid traits among modern Lapps, and also the scattered traces of some Mongoloid or Lapponoid types encountered much farther west. The distribution of great races during the period immediately preceding the beginning of the Christian era is accordingly depicted as follows: In the steppe belt from the Urals to Minusinsk we find the descendants of the Proto-European type connected with the Cr6-Magnon race (in the larger sense of the word). Near Baikal we find the Mongoloid type, extended to the west as far as the Baltic area, and in the extreme west mestisized during the Neolithic period with the Europoids who migrated from the south and settled in the forest belt of European Russia. Extensive changes in the boundaries of distribution of the great races occurred during the beginning of the Christian era when mass admixture of Mongoloid types is first noticed in the Minusinsk area. This was first discerned in the numerous burial masks of the Tashtyk culture. Anthropological analysis reveals that these represent a mixture of equal proportions of Europoid and Mongoloid elements. During the seventh to the ninth centuries A.D. the Mongoloid type pre- dominated on the steppes of western Siberia; almost no Europoid admixture has been discerned in the available paleoanthropological materials from this period. Had we not known definitely that these Iron Age Mongoloids settled on the territory formerly occupied by Europoid representatives, it would be quite probable that we would not be able even to assume the existence of the latter. It is, however, true that a possible Europoid admixture is discerned from anthropological materials belonging to some of the tribes of the Saian-</page><page sequence="4">FIELD AND PROSTOV] SOVIET INVESTIGATIONS IN SIBERIA 391 Altai uplands. Among the Shortsi this admixture is present among the tribes along the Abakan in Khakassia. From ethnographic and linguistic evidence Chernetsov and Prokof'ev con- clude that about the beginning of the present era certain ethnic waves were pushing to the northwest out of the Saian-Altai uplands and southern Siberia. To the same period in all probability belongs the infiltration of Europoid elements into the areas of northwest Siberia which are now inhabited by the Khant-Mansi and the tribes of the Samodian group. During the same period the Mongoloid elements also penetrated from the southeast into the steppe area of western Siberia. It is possible that to the same period belongs the penetration of Europoid types into the forest belt of western Siberia. The formation of mixed Europoido-Mongoloid types of west- ern Siberia took place: (a). In the north, as a result of migration of Europoids into the territories formerly occupied by Mongoloids. (b). In the south (Altai and Khakassia) as a result of migration of Mongo- loids into the territory formerly occupied by Europoids. These conclusions, however, must remain tentative. There is still a lack of data regarding many of the modern peoples of western and central Siberia. Thus no anthropological data whatsoever are available regarding the Taz group and only fragmentary information regarding the Kets. Fossil materials from northwestern Siberia are completely lacking. These would be necessary in order to erect the basic reference points for chronological interrelations between the aforementioned anthropological types. This is particularly true of the solution of the problem of the existence in northwestern Siberia of an Europoid admixture earlier than that which apparently had penetrated there at approximately the beginning of the present era. 2. According to Okladnikov2 the study of the ancient populations was not started until the latter part of the nineteenth century. M. A. Castren was first to discover the kinship of the Finnish, Turkish and Samoyed languages. Ac- cording to his theory the Saian-Altai highlands were the original home of these three groups. He was followed by Leopold J. von Schrenk, according to whose hypothesis all the peripheral tribes of northern Asia and those isolated tribes of the interior belonged to one group which he called Paleo-Asiatic. According to von Schrenk, the Paleo-Asiatics occupied originally a far more extensive territory than at present, but retreated under the pressure of the invaders and became finally established along the edges of the continent. Until recent archaeological data were available no evidence was on hand to establish either of the two great theories, the Ural-Altaian and the Paleo- Asiatic. In addition no facts could establish with any degree of exactness the 2 A. P. Okladnikov, Neolithic monuments as sources for the ethnogeny of Siberia and the Far East (Kratkie Soobshchenifn No. 9, Moscow, 1941), pp. 5-14.</page><page sequence="5">392 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s. 44 1942 interrelation of various ethnological and chronological data. A study of the Neolithic culture has revealed several previous errors such as the reputed uni- formity of the Siberian Neolithic, its identity with the forest belt of European Russia, its recent date and its "ethnographical character." It has now been firmly established that the Siberian Neolithic period is not at all uniform, and that it is not particularly recent. Of particular interest for the study of ethnogenesis was the discovery of great territorial groups of monuments with corresponding four local cultures: (a) Baikalian, central for Siberian Neolithic, expanded through the taigas, depending upon hunting and partly upon fishing. (b) Amur, opposite of (a) and the two Kamchatka cultures based on fishing. (c) Ob, coinciding in certain phases with the Amur Neolithic, in material culture and fishing. (d) Arctic, which it is impossible to comprehend outside the stern natural conditions and the peculiar economy of the sea-going hunters. Underlying these local Neolithic cultures are the peculiarities of the people associated with them and the ethnic formations of the past. According to the archaeological evidence each ethnic group of the Neolithic period had its own cultural life, its complex historical evolution, becoming still more complex because of the contacts with neighboring ethnic formations, the best known of which is the Neolithic period of the Baikal area. Here are discerned five successive stages ranging from the sixth millennium to the tenth century B.C. (a) Khin'skaia; (b) Isakovskaia; (c) Serovskaia; (d) Kitolskaia; (e) and Glazkovskaia, coinciding with the transition to metals. The Glazkovskaia stage, attributed to the end of the second millennium B.C., is significant for the study of ethnic relations between northern and eastern Asia. According to Ogorodnikov, the author of the first general Siberian history, during the latter part of the Ice Age the northern part of Europe and Asia was occupied by a dolichocephalic people, who inhabited this area until the close of the Neolithic period. Simultaneously since a very early period in Central Asia, there was formed a brachycephalic group, which during many centuries peopled the extensive areas of this part of the world and a large part of Europe. The brachycephals carried with them to the new lands the begin- ning of a high culture, based upon using the plow and raising cattle. They could also work in copper, bronze and gold. The main centers of this culture were China and Babylonia. The brachycephalic bearers of the copper-bronze culture left their homeland in two streams, one of which penetrated to southern Siberia, and on to the Saian-Altai highlands. The brachycephalic invaders partly destroyed and partly assimilated the less advanced dolichocephals of the Stone Age.</page><page sequence="6">FIELD AND PROSTOV] SOVIET INVESTIGATIONS IN SIBERIA 393 Other archaeologists, while accepting in general the theory of a radical and practically instantaneous change of populations and cultures through the ar- rival of a new race, claimed that in eastern Siberia, where the bronze-using con- querors of the steppes of western Siberia did not penetrate, this catastrophe occurred much later, during the Iron Age. This theory was based on: the reput- edly established hiatus between the Neolithic and the Iron Age cultures in eastern Siberia; the lack of monuments of true Bronze Age culture on the taiga; and of direct descendants of the Neolithic dolichocephals among the modern inhabitants of the Baikal area. All the more unexpected were the results of a study of Neolithic crania. Debets, who succeeded Roginskii in studying the skulls from Neolithic burials in the Baikal area, concluded during 1929-30 that Type "A" possessed "full- fledged ethnogeographic reality." According to Debets, "the type, provisionally called Type 'A' is most closely related to the skulls of the early Iron Age in Trans-Baikalia, and to the modern Tungus skulls of the northern Baikal area. I call this type Baikalian; in general, it is close to Buinak's Uralian type and to the Eskimo. It is more correct, however, to differentiate both as special types of the Paleo-Siberian variant (Race). Such a designation seems to be most convenient if one takes into consideration the wide distribution of this variant among totally different linguistic groups, the broken character of its area of distribution, which con- sists of small islands lying away from the paths of the later Ural-Altaian coloni- zation. It is possible that the North American (Eskimo) type will have to be set apart as a special variant. It appears sufficiently clear that the entire Paleo- Siberian variant belongs with the Mongoloids. It has all the diagnostic char- acters of the Mongoloid skull, among them a high, wide and flat face, a low nose with narrow nasal bones and high orbits." At that time Debets still did not have the necessary comparative crani- ological data for some of the other peoples of Siberia, especially the Evenks. He had data upon only four Tungus skulls from north of Baikal. Later Rogin- skil published the unique collection of anthropological materials made during 1927 by the expeditions from the Anthropological Institute of the First Mos- cow State University and the Central Museum of Ethnology among the Evenks of the Kindigir, Chilchagir and Shemagir clans from the northern shore of Lake Baikal. These materials completely confirmed the correctness of relating Type "A" skulls of Baikalian Neolithic sites with the skulls of the modern Evenks and Tungus. Roginskii concluded that the "Baikalian group is more ancient than the modern ethnic and linguistic subdivisions of northern Asia, that they did not come from any particular place, but had been formed upon the extensive expanse of the forest belt of Siberia." In the light of these anthropological studies of particular importance are some of the recent archaeological finds which can now be explained.</page><page sequence="7">394 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 44, 1942 Some of the recent discoveries at Khabsagaev burial ground on the Lena, at Fofanovo on the Selenga, and Pad Nokhol, Lenkovka, and other cemeteries in the Angara Valley have not only yielded the ornaments used during the Eneolithic Period, but because of the location of the ornaments consisting of hundreds of nacre beads, nephrite circlets, and pear-shaped beads manufac- tured from deer teeth it is possible to judge the general character of the cloth- ing. The most typical article of clothing was a bib or apron, embroidered and set with circlets of shell and stone. An apron from Fofanovo consisted of a solid broad strip formed of shining nacre beads reaching from the neck to the thighs. In the Nokhol burials the narrower strip widened at the pelvis and covered the spine of the deceased. Such a bib or apron was a necessary article in the costume of the modern Tungus, invariably supplementing the "tailcoat" opening in front. This type of costume is known from early accounts of the Tungus. The Cossacks in Siberia collected tribute in the form of these "Tungusic fur jackets (shubenki)." Georgi3 described richly ornamented bibs embroidered with dyed horsehair, attached to the neck by a string and reaching halfway down the thighs, a palm's breadth above and a span's breadth below. The Eneolithic peoples of the Baikal area wore clothes of the same cut as that of the modern Evenks, whose national costume differs radically from the customary garb of either the steppe-dwelling Buriats, the reindeer-raising tribes of the tundra, or the settled maritime folk of northeastern Siberia. It is also possible to reconstruct the headgear of the Eneolithic period, which most frequently was in the shape of a diadem, a narrow band spanning the forehead from temple to temple. The nephrite circlets and copper rings decorated the diadem in the middle of the forehead. At Lenkovka Pad' site four circlets of nephrite were located on the forehead, temples and the back of the head, in addition to the diadem spanning the forehead. Similar ornaments survived in the Evenk costumes until the seventeenth century in the form of buckles, locally manufactured of Chinese silver, sur- rounding their skull caps. Both the Evenki and the Eneolithic peoples decor- ated their footgear, the former with glass and paste beads, the latter with nacre and stone circlets. Of particular interest was the costume of the "Shaman woman" from Burial No. 3 at Ust Ude. The traditional diadem, with the central nephrite ring, surrounded her cap. On her breast were placed the stone ornaments of the apron, which was also decorated with two carved anthropomorphic effigies of mammoth ivory. A similar miniature anthropomorphic effigy was found in association with a child's burial near Bratsk. Such effigies, a close counterpart 8 Johann Gottlieb Georgi (1729-1802) author of Bemerkungen einer Reise im Russischen Reich im Jahre 1772, St. Petersburg, 1775.</page><page sequence="8">FIELD AND PROSTOV] SOVIET INVESTIGATIONS IN SIBERIA 395 of the Neolithic objects, are depicted on Georgi's plates depicting Tungus in hunting dress. According to Georgi, the Tungus habitually wore tin idols upon their aprons and during the summer upon their bodies, and used them as amulets to guarantee good hunting. The parallels between the Eneolithic people and the Evenks are not limited to costume. Similar traits are also manifested in their material culture: (a) In economy, both groups used hunting in the taiga and fishing as their basic industries. (b) In corresponding affairs related to domestic life: the tent-like shelter (chum) covered with turf, skins, or bast; implements; birch-bark boats; bone fish hooks of a characteristic form; bone fish-lures (kayadas); and many others. (c) Social order. (d) Rectilinear geometric ornamentation, schematization and conventional treatment of subjects and "pointed headed" deities. This was the true native soil of the art of the contemporary forest tribes of Siberia. (e) The Eneolithic people had a complex and apparently highly-developed religion, having much in common with shamanism recently practised by the Evenks. Shamans in their characteristic garb were found in the burials at Ust' Uda and Anosovo. Many mortuary rites of the Epipaleolithic period are explained by the recent beliefs of the Evenks. Thus the presence of ocher in graves is reflected in the Evenk legends about Kheladan, describing ocher as the blood of the dead; the eastern orientation of Neolithic skeletons and invocations of guiding spirits referring to it; river orientations and the belief in a "river of the dead" among the Evenks and the curious survivals of fisherman's customs amid the deer-raising Evenks, explicable only by the place of fishing in the life of their Eneolithic ancestors. There remain the special problems of the relation of the Eneolithic an- cestors of the Evenks to other tribes, and in particular to: the contemporane- ous Europoid steppe tribes; the modern forest tribes (Voguls); the Arctic tribes (Eskimo); and to Manchurians, Turks, and Mongols. Another problem of the same type would be the developments between the Eneolithic period and the seventeenth to the nineteenth century. At this stage it would be premature to attempt the solution of such prob- lems. It suffices to recognize that the available facts definitely connect the Evenks with their distant fore-fathers. Such facts demand that the traditional theories of the southern origin of the Tungus should be re-examined. The most recent supporter of this theory, S. M. Shirokogorov, derived the Tungus not only from northeastern Korea and Manchuria but also from China. His basic theses were: anthropological similarity between the Tungus and the North Chinese "Gamma" type described by him; the "southern" cut of Evenk costume; and the "southern" (not reflex) bow.</page><page sequence="9">396 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 44, 1942 Koppers further attributed to the Tungus the southern "agricultural" cult of heaven, and the Indian [?] serpent cult. However, these have been dismissed by anthropologists as artificially segregated types. The cults of heaven and of the serpent are universal phenomena, known for example from the Magda- lenian sites of Malta in Siberia and Mezin. The simple bow is also widely known, being the earliest stage of its history. Thus the only truly distinctive ethnological trait, the "southern" costume, simply goes to demonstrate the Tungus autochthony in the taiga, the "flying open" and "light" clothing facilitating the progress of the forest hunter, the ideal suitability to the natural and social. The Tungus' complete adaptation to their natural milieu is reflected not only in their clothes but in their entire domestic and cultural pattern including the sleighs, skis, and types of shelter present during the first Russian contacts -with the Tungus in the seventeenth century and apparently also 3000 years ago during the Eneolithic period on the shores of Lake Baikal and beside the Lena, Angara and Selenga rivers. A second important center of ethnogeny during the Neolithic period in Asiatic Russia was the area of distribution of the Amurian Neolithic culture. The peoples of this area followed a completely separate development. The following were typical: (a) Fishing rather than hunting as the principal occupation. (b) Settlements of sedentary fishermen rather than in the light "chum" shelters of the Baikalian hunters. (c) Flat-based rather than pointed pottery. (d) Basically a different art: unexpectedly rich, curvilinear ornamentation related to that of the Ainu and Maoris on one side and to the Neolithic cultures of China (Yangshao) and Japan (Jomon) on the other; consisting particularly of that type of ribbon ornamentation characterized by complex motifs such as the weave, spiral and meander in contradistinction to the rectilinear geometric decoration of the Baikalian culture. What are the chronological limits of the Amurian Neolithic period? On one side the proximity to the powerful focus of Chinese culture has been felt here since an early date. Late Chou burials near Khabarovsk coincide with the latter phases of the Neolithic period, attributed to the second or third millennium B.C. This dating is supported by parallels with Yangshao cultural types in China and Shakuotun types in southwestern Manchuria discernible in many of the Amurian Neolithic monuments of the character of the oldest settlement on Suchu Island. It is natural that the vestiges of the most ancient culture of this type should have been most completely preserved during the largest period of time in the most backward regions of the Amur, among the Ulchis, Gilyaks [Nivkhs] and the Ainu. Thus on the basis of these new data appears confirmation of Sternberg's theories concerning the Ainu.</page><page sequence="10">FIELD AND PROSTOV] SOVIET INVESTIGATIONS IN SIBERIA 397 While a true northern or Siberian culture was developing in the Baikal region, a definite southern culture with Pacific affinities, possibly of Pacific origin, was growing in the Amur region during the Neolithic period. The latter, a direct extension of the cultures of the insular world surrounding eastern and southeastern Asia, penetrated to the center of northeastern Asia along one of the greatest rivers of this continent. This contribution from archaeological evidence appears to be still more important in view of the fact that an analogous picture is disclosed for north- eastern and northwestern Siberia. No such direct connection between the ancient and northern populations can be traced either upon the much more extensively explored territory of western Europe, or even in the steppe belt of Siberia. It is doubtful if anybody will be able to compare Mongols and Kazakhs with the Neolithic peoples of this area. The main reason is that one must con- sider the vast expanse of Siberia with its variety of natural conditions, and the presence of independent ecological areas (zones of taiga, tundra, steppes and specific geomorphic areas such as the steppe areas of Minusinsk and the moun- tainous belt of the Saians). This geographical variability has tended to pre- dispose the native populations to independent and original development, aid- ing in the early growth of specific local cultures of fishermen, hunters, sea-going hunters, and steppe nomads. By isolating individual tribes the large forests and broad rivers of the taiga helped to preserve their native way of life and local traits as well as their anthropological types. Still more important were the general backwardness of culture and the severity of the climate determining the slow tempo of the development of these isolated Hyperboreans. Except for China the advanced centers of the world were too far removed for cultural contacts. However, China remained for a long time isolated within its boundaries. It must be observed that in the Siberian Neolithic and Eneolithic periods the Afanas'evo culture of the steppes is a radical and yet explicable exception from the general pattern. In modern Siberia we find neither any direct descendants of the Afanas'evo peoples nor any survivals of their widespread, colorful, and original culture. In order to understand and explain these facts, it is necessary to take into account two circumstances: (a) Notwithstanding some attempts to derive one directly from the other, the Afanas'evo culture is entirely alien to the Siberian forest Neolithic period, at the present time the most completely known of the Siberian Neolithic cul- tures. The Afanas'evo pottery is most characteristically different from the Baikalian forest pottery. No significant groups of Neolithic monuments have been discovered on the territory of Afanas'evo culture. (b) In view of this, it is still more interesting that the Afanas'evo culture emerges by revealing traits of a very high degree of development. The most sig-</page><page sequence="11">398 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 44, 1942 nificant fact is that the Afanas'evo people knew the principal varieties of do- mesticated animals such as the horse, cow, and sheep. They were also considerably advanced in the techniques of working metals, using hafted knives and covering their vessels with hammered copper. In addition, the Afanas'evo culture was succeeded directly by the Andro- novo culture using celts and other objects of a very highly perfected type. Many elements in the inventories of Afanas'evo culture, obviously alien to Siberia and particularly to eastern Siberia, must not pass unnoticed. Here be- long: Corbicula fluminalis shells from the region of the Aral Sea; dwellings, without chimneys, of the pit-and-catacomb type; painted vessels described by S. V. Kiselev from Tesino burial ground; animal husbandry; and metal-working techniques. No less important is the fact that during the Afanas'evo period, coinciding with the end of the Kitoian and the beginning of the Glazkovian stages, there can be discerned in the Yenisei the dividing line between the basically Mongo- loid types near Baikal and the Europoid peoples of the steppes. With what cultures and peoples of the west were connected the Europoid bearers of the Afanas'evo culture it is possible to decide by comparing it with the remains of the pit-and-catacomb culture on the steppes of southern Russia and in the North Caucasus, and, especially with the newly-discovered Kelte- minar culture in Khwarazm on the lower Amu Darya. The Afanas'evo culture, genetically connected with the west and the Europoid peoples of the west, ini- tiated the Bronze culture of the steppes. The development of these cultures was not rectilinear. Anthropological evidence shows that a new Mongoloid popula- tion as well as several completely new ethnic groups extended over the steppes. In contradistinction to the forests, the steppes, with the emergence of ani- mal husbandry, became the main arteries for the diffusion of cultural influences and for migrations. The processes of intensive hybridization and mixture of tribes and cultures began at a very early period on the Siberian steppes. It is therefore impossible to trace the direct connections between the ancient and modern ethnic formations, a theoretical possibility in the wilder forest regions of Siberia. 3. Wooden "idols" or human effigies were discovered by the Uralian Expeditions4 of the State Historical Museum, Moscow, during excavations from 1926 to 1931 at Gorbunovo in the Lower Tagil district of the Sverdlovsk region. These objects were attributed to the end of the second or to the beginning of the first millennium B.C. Of the five objects from Gorbunovo four are of indeterminate sex and one of a male deity. Two fragments of effigies, one a male, were found at Shigir Gorodishche. 4 D. N. Eding, Idoly Gorbunovskogo torfianika: Idols from the Gobrunovo peet marsh (Sovets- kafa Arkheologia, No. 4, 1937), pp. 133-146.</page><page sequence="12">FIELD AND PROSTOV] SOVIET INVESTIGATIONS IN SIBERIA 399 Eding noted the phallic character of two of the effigies and concluded that the appearance of male deities indicated the decline of matriarchate in the Urals at this period. These effigies are excessively crude compared to the high artistic stand- ards attained by other contemporaneous Uralian craftsmen. Eding explains this either by the religious fear of the people that exact portraits of the dead might result in too close a connection between the spirits and the idols or that the preparation of the effigies was in the hands of a priestly class or some other social group not endowed artistically. Among the Ostyaks, Kalmuks, Samoyeds, Tungus and Buriats of Siberia a similar r6le played by the Shamans was recorded by early travelers in Siberia. Eding also describes a slate slab, bearing a sketch of a similar figurine, which was excavated at Shigir. A similar amber amulet was found in Finland. 4. This report5 is the first attempt to cotirdinate the materials regarding the history of the Ostyaks and the Voguls inhabiting the middle and lower courses of the Ob' River, a territory divided into taiga and tundra zones. This variation in the ecology of the north and south of these areas resulted in the different cultural patterns. The earliest archaeological monuments of the taiga zone belong to the Up- per Neolithic period. These indicate a population whose main occupations were hunting and fishing. One of the best preserved sites is a settlement on a sand promontory of a now dry lake near the upper course of the Liapin River, a tributary of the northern Sosva. This site, partly excavated by S. G. Boch dur- ing 1934 and by V. N. Chernetsov in 1935, consisted of about twenty rec- tangular holes, originally dugout dwellings, some large (25 by 25 meters or 28 by 22 meters, and three 20 by 20 meters) but the most common size was 10 by 10 meters. The largest hole was 3.0 meters deep. One of the small dwellings excavated during 1935 yielded polished chisels, scrapers, points and knives of hard slate, and small scrapers and flakes of flint and quartz. The pottery vessels made of clay rolls had oviform bases and were decorated from top to bottom with comb ornament. On the basis of the animal remains in the cultural stratum, the natives en- gaged in fishing and hunting, mainly elks. Similar data were found at contemporaneous sites such as at the mouth of Khulium Sunt River and from below the cultural stratum of the Sartyn'e Gorodishche No. 1. Among the objects were a drilled stone disk, a crudely worked cuneiform slate implement with badly-worn argtes possibly used as a hoe, and a scraper of very high workmanship. The implements and pottery from all these sites are closely related to the 6 V. N.

Thus they can be attributed provisionally to the second millennium B. C. A similar but more highly developed culture was encountered in the monu- ments of the end of the second or at the beginning of the first millennium B. C. Stone implements became less common. Arrowheads and scrapers are abun- dant. Pottery became more variegated both as to forms and ornament. Flat- based vessels and shallow bowls appeared for the first time. The dugout dwelling was still used, but decreased in size, rarely exceeding 300 square meters. A different type of culture is found in the northern part of the Ob territory. The first settlements of marine hunters were discovered by Chenetsov during 1929 on IAmal Peninsula. While these monuments belong to a much later pe- riod, they are undoubtedly connected with a more remote period, and deserve study. A site, consisting of three shallow, round dugouts, was found on TiuteTi- Sale ("Walrus") promontory along the rise of the precipitous escarpment at the confluence of the Tiutel IAga and Ser IAga rivers. Each hearth was located in the middle of the dugout, the roof being sup- ported by vertical poles. The floors were covered with thick compressed layers of wood chips, coal, charred bones, scraps of leather and whalebone, all indi- cating a long occupation. The bones consisted of seal, walrus, arctic bear and whale, with a few of reindeer, polar fox and various birds. Stone implements and potsherds were found in one house. Stone implements included a quartz scraper for leather- working, fragments of polished implements, and whetstones of sandstone and slate. Among bone implements were crude arrowheads, chisels, rowlocks, spoons and spatulate scrapers for leather-working. Many remains of wooden imple- ments also were excavated. The pottery, manufactured of bluish clay with ad- mixture of coarse sand, was represented by two main forms: round-based with long and straight necks; flat-based, barrel-shaped with a low bottom; and a few shallow bowls. The stamp ornament, produced with a comb and other blocks, is relatively rich and graceful. A few iron objects including arrowheads, a knife, and a ring were found. This site is therefore attributed to the first millennium A.D. From apparently contemporaneous sites bronze objects such as an epau- lette-like clasp with the effigy of a bear of P'ianoborsk type, rectangular buckles, and the Lomovatoe type bird effigy confirm this dating. These sites are located along the shores of the IAmal and IArai Peninsula, on Belyi Island, down to the mouth of Khatanga River on the east, and along the shores of the Bol'shezemel'skaia and Malozelmel'skaia tundras down to Kania Nos Peninsula in the west. This peculiar maritime culture has ob- viously developed out of the "Arctic Neolithic," the monuments of which, dated in the middle of the first millennium B.C., had been found along the</page><page sequence="14">FIELD AND PROSTOV] SOVIET INVESTIGATIONS IN SIBERIA 401 Pechora River, on Cheshskaia Gvuba Cape at the mouth of the Indiga River, and at Olenil Island near Murmansk shore. Both cultures have identically shaped bone harpoons with hafted points and with one or two symmetrical barbs. In contradistinction to the Behring Sea harpoons, the points of the west- ern harpoons were not hafted for insertion into the bone tube of the harpoon, but were fitted over it. Other significant parallels between the two cultures were: the permanent settlement of dugout dwellings close to the sea; profusion of bone implements and pottery; use of leather kayaks of Eskimo type; and the use of whale bones in building. The eastern maritime culture survived down to the middle of the second millennium A.D., and, in certain areas, later. Some evidence on the life of the marine hunters has been preserved in accounts of old travelers such as Stephen Barrow, Pierre de la Martiniere and Beliavskil and in local traditions among the reindeer-breeding tundra-dwellers, the Nentsis. According to these records the seashore settlements were used only during winter. In summer the hunters went into the taiga to hunt deer and geese, and to fish in the lakes and rivers. Some sites, located on the tundra lakes, on the dunes of Tazovskaia Guba and Obskaia Guba Capes, and on the shores of the Kara Sea, were attributed to the early or middle Bronze Age and contained bone points, stone scrapers, and flint arrowheads, all associated with pottery closely related to that of Tiutef- Sale. Other dune sites of the late Bronze and Iron Ages were found to the south of Tiutei Cape and in the delta of the Ob. Very little can be said regarding the ethnic affinities of the Upper Neolithic peoples of the Middle and Lower Ob area. No anthropological differences were observed between the northern and the southern peoples, both showing the presence of Mongoloid traits, apparently ancient in this area. Both groups, however, reveal an affinity with the peoples of eastern Siberia. According to Prokof'ev, who bases his conclusions upon philological6 evidence, the Arctic tribes were in some manner related to the peoples of northeastern Siberia. A Mongoloid skull was excavated at a site on Khaen Sale Cape on Malygin Straits. The type of stone axe with perforated lugs, a type hitherto considered peculiar to eastern Siberia, was found at taiga sites in the Ob region. During the second half of the first millennium B.C. in the culture of the tribes of northwestern Siberia begin to appear for the first time certain ele- ments from the culture of southern steppes. Such elements became well-ex- pressed toward the beginning of the Christian era. Earliest of these are bronze kettles from the sites in the forest belt of the Ob and Irtysh rivers; some, namely those from KullaI Mountain in Narym, probably belong to the Minu- sinsk tumulus stage. Bronze celts and a miniature votive hammer (klevets) found at the mouth of the Poluf River, a battle-axe and a hammer from near Berezovo are attributed to the second half of the first millennium B.C. 6 The most deceptive and unreliable criterion (H.F.).</page><page sequence="15">402 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 44, 1942 Locally manufactured objects related to the importations from the steppes appeared at the beginning of the Christian era. Most significant were clay copies of Scythian kettles which practically replaced local types. These vessels are found throughout the Ostyak-Vogul area. Of particular importance for the comprehension of the events at the be- ginning of the present era is the recently discovered site at the mouth of the Polul River. This site, on a high sandy bank at the confluence of the Ob and the PoluI, near Ob Cape, at the boundary of the forest and tundra belts, was occupied from long before the beginning of the Christian Era until at least the fifth or sixth century A.D. In turn this site had been used as: a settlement, during Anan'ino-P'ianoborsk Period; a sacrificial area, fourth to eighth cen- tury A.D.; at some time a combination of the previous two; and at an unde- terminate period a gorodishche, of which parts of the moat and breastworks still survive. About 12,000 objects were excavated at Polui. The main industries were hunting, especially sea animals, and fishing. Finds included: well-made bone harpoons; arrowheads of many shapes, mainly trihedral and rhomboidal, and also barbed and with elongated hafts; and bone tablets used for tipping bows, The inhabitants also engaged in food-gathering, since bone portions of digging sticks came to light. Many bronze objects included celts and arrowheads of original types. Stone pestles and querns were apparently used in grinding edible roots and berries. Among domesticated animals, the dog was most prominent. The dog was used not only as a draft animal (bone parts of harness were found together with a carved image of a harnessed dog) but also as sacrificial animal since there were many canine skulls with perforated occipital bones. While the use of domesticated reindeer' was known, some evidence suggests that tamed deer may have been used as lures in hunting. Thus at Ust' Polul we find a combination of two widely different cultures, the arctic hunting-fishing culture, and the southern steppe culture. To the lat- ter belong, in addition to the numerous importations, such objects as the high- based clay vessels imitating the bronze kettles of the steppes, daggers resem- bling Scytho-Sarmatian, votive bronze daggers and hammers (klevtsi) of late Tagar type, and carved combs. This duality of culture is also reflected in the highly developed decorative art of this period. On one side, it shows purely realistic traditions, as for example the naturalistic animal effigies reminiscent of those of the Upper Neolithic and early Bronze periods from the central Urals. However, a completely different artistic tradition appears on many other objects, such as the motif of an eagle attacking a deer-a subject well- known in the art of early Siberian nomads. To the same tradition belongs the circular effigy of a bird of prey scratched upon one of the bronze disks of the SCf. AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST, Vol. 40, No. 4, footnote 39, p. 678, 1938.</page><page sequence="16">FIELD AND PROSTOV] SOVIET INVESTIGATIONS IN SIBERIA 403 P'ianoborsk period. Further connections with the steppe tradition were found in the eastern part of the territory: a scaly horn breastplate of Sarmatian type found during the digging of the Ob-Yenisei Canal; Scythian kettles; effigies of animals alien to the taiga, such as the ram and the boar; and the cast bronze, circular figurine of a reclining wild animal from near Narym. The amplitude of the cultural changes testifies that these were due not only to the development of barter with the south, but also with the appearance in northwestern Siberia of a new ethnic element bearing with it the traditions of the Scytho-Sarmatian culture of the steppes. Certain Ostyak and Vogul ethnonymic and toponymic words are variously connected with the tribal names of the Huns, particularly the native names of the Ostyaks-Khante-Khuntu, compared to the Hun Hunnu, and of Voguls, Man'si, compared to the Magyar of the Hungarians. Parallels between the Hungarian and Vogul terms pertaining to horse-breeding suggest a common Iranian origin. From the mixture of this new ethnic element in the Ob area with the ab- original populations there resulted the contemporary Ostyaks and Voguls.s In general, this process took place within the limits of the P'ianoborsk period. The new arrivals, who used a Ugrian tongue, were originally a part of the Scytho-Sarmatian world of the steppes. Coming north they abandoned horse- breeding and engaged in hunting and fishing. At the same time they exercised a profound influence upon the technique, social order, ideology and, particularly upon the language of the native peoples, the latter becoming mainly Ugrian. The former companionship with the horse was retained only in decorative art, folklore, and ritual. With the arrival of the Ugrians into the Ob area, metallurgy, which if it existed here at all must have been very primitive, began to develop rapidly. Local metallurgical industry appeared during the early Ugrian period, con- temporaneous with the P'ianoborsk culture in the western Urals. Here belong very archaic and primitive copper objects, flat animal and human figurines, 8 Cf. N. N. Cheboksarov and T. A. Trofimova, Antropologicheskoe isushenie Mansi [Anthro- pological investigation of the Mansi] (Kratkie soobshchenfa IIMK, No. 9, 1941), pp. 28-37. Here- tofore the anthropological type of Voguls ("Mansi" as they call themselves) had been known from a series of measurements on seventy-five individuals made by S. I. Rudenko in the basin of the northern Sosva River. On the basis of these data the Voguls were stated to be the most typical representatives of the Ugrian or Uralian group, usually considered to be Mongoloid, but with cer- tain transitional Europoid traits. During 1939 a series of 213 men and 187 women were measured in the Molotov and Sverdlovsk regions by the North Uralian Expedition of the Anthropological Museum of Moscow State University. Studies revealed a close parallelism between the Mansi and the Kets from the Yenisei River, the Yenisei Americanoid complex being represented more or less strongly in one of the three large groups measured. Closely related is IArkho's South Siberian type, widespread among the Kazakhs and Kirghiz. An admixture of a mesocephalic Europoid type, possibly Ugrian, was also discerned. Connection of the Yenisei type with the Paleo-Asiatic tribes from the east is also indicated.</page><page sequence="17">404 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 44, 1942 sometimes combining zoimorphic and anthropomorphic features, roughly cast in earthen moulds. Two types have been recognized: one in the east, centering on the upper course of the Ob and in the area between the Ob and the Yenisei; the other in the west in the middle and probably in the lower basin of the Ob River. While each earthen mould could have been used only once, twenty copies of a motif have often been found. Sometimes each item of the entire series of such objects as the group of running wolves found near the Irtysh River is broken in half. These undoubtedly possessed a ritual or magic character. A similar use of copper figurines was recorded among the Kandinsk Voguls at the beginning of the twentieth century. A further connection between the flat figurines from the western area with the southern steppe culture is seen from the resemblance of the treatment of the latter with the series of flat figurines of warriors, whose armaments re- sembled Scytho-Sarmatian weapons, from Sapogovaia near Sverdlovsk. The metal objects from the eastern area are distinguished by the unique filigree type of casting. These can only be compared with the latter shamanistic paraphernalia current among the Kets. Apparently the flat archaic casting was retained in P'ianoborsk culture together with highly advanced techniques of metal working because of the religious r6le of the former. The latter had supposedly developed under the influence of the P'ianoborsk culture of the western Urals. From that area many typical objects were carried from the Urals to the Ob area, notably the peculiar epaulette-like clasps of the Kama type, the introduction of which resulted in a local Obian variant. By the middle of the first millennium of A.D. the ethnogenetic process had become completed. Thus, there appeared in the Ob area two peoples closely related by language and culture-the Khants (Ostyaks) and the Mansi (Voguls). To the east in the Narym country and in the area lying between the Ob and the Yenisei a new ethnic wave made its appearance about the middle of the first millennium A.D. These were the Samodian tribes, who came in contact with the Kets and with the eastern group of the Ob-Ugrian tribes. As a result of their arrival there was formed a new people, the Selkups, uniting the traits of the local, Ugrian, and Kettan populations with those of the Samodian in- vaders, while adopting to a large degree the language of the latter. The ethnological distribution of populations in northwestern Siberia during the second half of the first millennium A.D. may be described as follows: To the east, along the left bank of the Yenisei, lived the Kets and their westerly neighbors, the Selkups. The Ob-Ugrian tribes, the Voguls and Ostyaks lived in the basin of the middle and lower Ob and on the lower course of the Irtysh River. To the south Ostyaks bordered on the Kara Kidans, whom they</page><page sequence="18">FIELD AND PROSTOV] SOVIET INVESTIGATIONS IN SIBERIA 405 called Khatan-the term which later was used to designate Tatars. To the west, Ugrian tribes, probably the Voguls, inhabited the slopes of the middle Ural Mountains down to the modern city of Sverdlovsk along the Tura, Tagil, Neiva, and Rezh rivers; and on the western slope along the Chusovaia and in the basins of the Upper Kama and Upper Pechora rivers. Beyond the polar circle to the north the Ugrians bordered on the ancient aboriginal Arctic tribes, while the tundra was but sparsely populated. The interrelations between the taiga and the steppe areas of Siberia were not unilateral. Many finds testify to the penetration of typical Ob and western slope objects, such as bird figurines and pendants, far to the east and southeast down to the foothills of the Altai. Further connections of the Ostyaks and Voguls with the outer world took place during the second half of the first millennium A.D. The former contacts of the Ugrians were not abandoned after their migration into the Ob area. Commodities from Iran and Khwarazm were carried north along the familiar routes and traded for furs, mammoth ivory and "fish teeth" [whale bone]. Traces of these relations are also obvious from the frequent discoveries of silver trays in the Ob basin and in the Kama Urals. Such trays were used in the religious ceremonies connected with the Sun cult of the Ob-Ugrians wide- spread during first millennium A.D., and are frequently found in sacrificial spots and in hoards. The existence of commercial relations between the more highly cultured western neighbors of the Ugrians and the Iranian world is mentioned by several Arabic authors. As a result of the commerical development many new elements mingled with Ugrian culture, especially in the areas adjoining trade routes. Discoveries at Barsov Gorodok in Surgut Region and at Isker near Tobolsk reveal that in conjunction with many stable cultural traditions of the past the existence of cattle-raising and iron-working resulted in profound changes both in material culture and in social development. In the more distant parts, however, primi- tive community life, centering around large collective dwellings, survived into the second millennium. Approximately in the tenth century first appear on the tundras of north- western Siberia the nomadic, reindeer-breeding Samodians. Progressing west- ward they gradually assimilated the aboriginal Arctic tribes and, in part the northern groups of the Ugrians, retaining such elements from the cultures of the latter as were best adapted to the local physical conditions. The conquest of the tundra by the Samodian tribes was probably completed during the first centuries of the second millennium, but the ancient maritime culture of the Arctic littoral survived in places down to the sixteenth and seventeenth cen- turies A.D. During the first centuries of the second millennium the northern Ugrian tribes borrowed from the Nentsi the practice of raising reindeer.</page><page sequence="19">406 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N.
