<plain_text><page sequence="1">MEANING AND ACTION* MAY BRODBECK University of Minnesota This paper examines the current variant of the view that meaningful human actions are not amenable to causal, scientific explanation. Rather, the view examined holds that, understanding the language, we understand the meaning of other people's overt acts by analyzing the concepts appropriately applied to the situation, tracing their logical connections with other mentalistic concepts. A matter of conceptual analysis, our under- standing of man is held to be a priori and necessary rather than, as with the natural sciences, a posteriori and contingent. Various uses of 'concept', 'meaning', and 'understanding' are here distinguished. It is then shown, first, how the objectivist can in principle account for intentionality and for "rule-governed" behavior, that is, for the presence and efficacy of mind in the world. Secondly, current criticisms of the objectivist program are examined. An uncritical use of 'concept' and of 'rule', as well as a fusion of various uses of 'meaning' and 'under- standing', gives those criticisms a specious plausibility that does not withstand close analysis. It is concluded that the objectivist program has not been shown to be untenable. "What is left over if I subtract the fact that my arm goes up from the fact that I raise my arm?" ([9], p. 161, ?621) One may interpret Wittgenstein's question to concern the nature of human action. Recently, that question has been given a certain answer from which a moral has been drawn regarding the nature of our knowledge and understanding of man. Briefly, the something "left over" that distinguishes a mere bodily movement from an action is, according to the answer, the meaning of that movement. The moral drawn is that the meaningful constituents of an action make it logically impossible to explain human actions causally, in the sense in which we can causally explain physical events like bodily movements. Though the answer itself requires considerable unpacking, it is, I believe, essentially correct. But once that necessary analysis is made, the moral drawn, I shall try to show, is a non sequitur. An action, as I shall use that term, is any bit of behavior whose complete description, that is, an account of what is occurring, requires mention, in addition to manifest behavior, either of such things as the person's motives, intentions and thoughts or of such things as moral, legal, or conventional standards or rules. Strictly speaking, an explicit mention of standards is redundant, since they essentially involve thoughts or purposes. However, since these standards need not be in the mind of the person acting in accordance with a rule, as well as for other reasons that will appear as the argument unfolds, it may help to mention standards separately. The discussions stimulated by Wittgenstein's question have revived one side of an old controversy embodied in the question, "Can there be a science of man and society ?" The side now revived opposes the affirmative answer of those who stress an essential identity in method between the physical sciences and the study of man. The latter reason (in part) along the following lines. Other people's mental states, their thoughts, feelings, wishes, and hopes, are not directly accessible to public inspection. Nor can we test the everyday inferences we make to them, from what we do observe, in the * Received June 1962.

Though we frequently may be right in our everyday inferences to other people's mental states from their behavior, all we have to go on is what people choose to tell us or their observable behavior. Since there is no way of independently testing for the occurrence of these criteria and what they are criteria for, the proponents of a science of man eschew all talk about mental states. They maintain that nevertheless a complete description and causal explanation of human actions can be given in principle by means of terms that, like those of physical science, have reference only to objectively observable properties of material objects. The material objects of their concern are of course people's bodies, the characters, among others, are the observable behaviors of these bodies under certain conditions and in certain environments. The mentalistic terms characterizing actions, like 'purpose' and 'thought', are, on this account, all eliminable by definitions using only nonmentalistic terms. On this view, the social scientist is a spectator of the human scene, noting its observable features and the connections among them. He seeks regularities in human behavior, just as the physicist looks for them in inanimate behavior. His assertions being based upon observation are also refutable by it. Like those of natural science, they are at best contingent, empirical truths. This view, within psychology, is of course known as behaviorism. For a broader notion to encompass all social areas, as well as to avoid certain connotations of that term, I shall call the doctrine "objectivism." Revived now is the negative side of the controversy, namely, the insistence upon an intrinsic difference between the study of man and of things. The objectivist pro- gram is held to be hopelessly misguided, not merely because it is practically unfeosible but because it is radically mistaken. By the spectator methods, all that the objectivist can learn are, on this view, the external, overt features of actions. Their internal aspects, the motives, intentions, and reflections, by which overt behavior is understood as meaningful human action elude him entirely. To understand a human action is to know its motive. Motive explanations, however, are neither a species of causal expla- nations nor are they replaceable by such explanations. Social concepts, like money or voting, cannot be adequately described in "neutral" nonmentalistic terms or under- stood by objectivist methods. We observe only manifest behavior, like a hand going up or pulling a lever, not the internal meaning of an action, like hand-raising or voting. This meaning lies in the logical connections the action has with the complex of desires, intentions, choices, reasons, conventions and moral rules that are all inextricably involved together in social life. As participants in a community, we have learned to use these concepts. Understanding the language, we understand the meaning of other people's overt acts by analyzing the concepts appropriately applied to the situation, tracing their logical connections with the other mentalistic concepts. A matter of conceptual analysis, our understanding and knowledge of man is therefore a priori and necessary rather than, as with the natural sciences, a posteriori and contingent. The empirical science of man envisaged by the objectivist is thus in principle, that is, conceptually or logically, impossible.' Since belief in the essential ineliminability of mentalistic terms is central to the current rejection of "objectivism," I shall call this position "mentalism." Possibly there is some incongruity in attributing "mentalism" to some among these critics 1 Extended statements of the position here outlined are to be found in [8] and [7]. I shall be concerned in this paper primarily, though not solely, with their formulations.</page><page sequence="3">MEANING AND ACTION 311 who deny, or appear to deny, that terms ever have a reference to private mental states. But the mentalistic label seems to be justifiable not only historically, but also systematic- ally, by the emphasis on the uneliminability of the mentalistic terms. The incongruity, if any, is, I suggest, not of my making. First of all, I wish to explain some notions which, though now controversial, are nevertheless indispensable to clarity about the issues at stake. The word 'concept' is ambiguous. In one usage, 'concept' is applied to those classes of words, either sounds or marks, that are used to refer to characters of things, either properties or relations. I shall call them terms. 'White' and 'bianco' are two different words, but only one term. 'Concept' also has a mentalistic use, as applied to the content of a thought. I shall use 'concept' in this way for, generally, the content of any mental act, whether it be thinking, perceiving, believing, hoping, or intending. (A mental act is not, of course, an action, though they are intimately connected.) The thought of something's being green, of a unicorn in the garden, or of rain tomorrow, are all, in this usage, concepts. Terms may be used to refer either to concepts, that is, to someone's thought of something, or to nonmentalistic things and their characters. When, in any context, we know the character or characters that a term is being used to refer to, the term has a reference or, as I shall call it, meaning,. When, within natural science, the reference of a term, say, 'pressure', is known to be lawfully connected to other things, as the pressure of a gas is connected with its volume and temperature, then the term is also significant or "meaningful" or has what I shall call meaning2. The meaning1 of a term is a matter of convention; its meaning2, if any, is a matter of fact. Only these two uses of 'meaning' are appropriately applied to scientific terms. They do not, however, exhaust the uses of 'meaning'. Though concepts or mental states are the reference of some terms, they do not themselves refer to anything, any more than (nonlinguistic) physical states refer to anything. Yet, thoughts do "mean" other things, in a way in which nonmental or physical events do not "mean" anything. It is characteristic of mental acts generally, and of mental acts alone, that they "mean" or are directed toward something else. The thought or concept of a castle or of rain tomorrow is about a kind of material thing or event. What the thought "means" is, by a dead teleological metaphor, called its intention. Obviously, one need not adopt the metaphysics of an active Self to recognize that thoughts are about something. 'Meaning' is ambiguous even in this particular context. Sometimes the thought itself is called the "meaning," for it is that which means or intends. When used in this way, a "meaning" is what I am calling a concept. Sometimes, what the thought intends or means is called the "meaning." In this use, a meaning is often something nonmen-tal, though, of course, we often also think about thoughts, our own and others'. I shall here use 'intentional meaning' so that intentional meaning or, briefly, meaning3 is what a mental act intends, means, or is about. To have a thought or to think about something is one fact; what this thought intends or means3 is a different, usually nonmental, fact. Terms refer, concepts intend. The term 'green' means1 the color green, because we have chosen to use the term in this way. Meaning1 or reference is a complex natural or descriptive relation between language users, language, and the world. A set of marks or sounds does not intrinsically refer to anything. On the other hand, it is intrinsic to mental concepts that they mean or intend something else, either in the present, past, or future. Intentionality or meaning3 is characteristic of thoughts, not something we bestow upon them. However, the meaning3 relation between a thought and its intention is neither a natural relation, like taller or being to the left of, nor a</page><page sequence="4">312 MAY BRODBECK causal relation. The reasons it is neither are fairly obvious. For there to be a descriptive relation, both terms of that relation must exist. But we can think what is false or imagine something that does not exist. Moreover, thinking about something does not, in any relevant sense, causally affect the thing thought about. Meaning3, the relation between a thought and its intention, is, in a specificable sense, a logical relation.2 Still another difference between concepts and terms is crucial. Two terms may refer to or mean, the same thing. Two concepts never intend or mean3 the same thing. The expressions ethe square of three' and 'the sum of 7 and 2' both may be used to refer to the same thing, namely, nine. But the concept or thought-of-three-square does not intentionally mean the same as the thought-of-the-sum-of-7-and-2. We may express thoughts in various ways, by action or by speech, but to describe them we need language. The linguistic expression describing the thought is the text of that thought. Two different linguistic events may express the same facts, but are the texts of two different thoughts. The sentence, S1, "There are seven plus two buttons in the box" referentially means the same as the sentence, S2, "There are three-square buttons in the box," but they are the texts of two different thoughts, for the thought- that-S1 does not intentionally mean the same as the thought-that-S2, since one may firmly believe the former and doubt the latter. Though the term 'nine', means1 the same as the term cthe square of three', the concept of nine does not intentionally mean3 the same as the concept of the square of three. Even when two different expressions refer to the same thing, the concepts of which they are the texts do not have the same (intentional) meaning3. Generally, in mental contexts, like Mary knows, believes, or remembers that-S, replacing the text of S with another expression having the same referential meaning need not preserve the truth of the whole statement. In fact, no two different concepts ever mean3 the same, for they are different just because they have different intentional meanings. Intentional meaning of concepts is unique, while referential meaning of terms is not. To think that it might snow tomorrow and to think about putting snowtires on the car are different thoughts, nor is either the same as actually performing that task or having a disposition to do so. Thinking about something, say, castles in Spain, is, like the dreary rain that may evoke the thought, a particular occurrence at a particular time. Generally such mental episodes are not identical with any behavior or dispositions to behave that, as we significantly say, manifest them. Moreover, bodily states manifest mental ones, not tautologically, as bending "manifests" flexibility, but contingently, as exploding manifests chemical composition. Our everyday statements about minds, our own and others, are categorical. The mentalistic terms they contain have reference to states of mind that, unlike bodily states, cannot be inspected publicly. Since mental- istic terms do not either referentially or intentionally mean the same as nonmentalistic terms, they cannot be replaced "without residue" by such terms. All this I take to be common sense, that is, something we all know from our own experience. I take it also to be a commonsensical core of the mentalistic thesis, whether or not its proponents would agree with my way of putting it. Though we cannot observe another man's conscious states, we certainly often can tell what other people are thinking or feeling. We can do so because, whether volun- tarily or involuntarily, we evince our mental states by overt physical features, including behavior, or by dispositions to exhibit such features under certain conditions. Privacy, in other words, does not entail ignorance about other people's mental states, merely that 2 For details, see [1], [2], and [3].</page><page sequence="5">MEANING AND ACTION 313 we know them differently from the way we know our own. Yet, though there are minds and bodies, there are no interacting minds. This is a piece of scientific common sense, that is, something scientists believe on the basis of their extended experience. This belief has two components. First, that there are no disembodied minds or, more precisely, whenever there is a mental state, there is always a corresponding bodily state, either neurological, physiological, behavioral, or some combination of these. The connection between mental states and such bodily states is correlational. That is how we can tell, by inference, what other people are thinking. Secondly, mental events parallel but do not interact with physical events. In other words, despite the correlation between mind and body, no mental state causally affects any material state and conversely. In a phrase, the view is that the physical world, including men's bodies, is causally closed with respect to minds. Unpacked, the phrase means that the laws used to explain and to predict physical phenomena need mention nothing nonphysical, in the broad sense of 'physical' which includes not only the terms of physics, but also overt behavior, utterances, physiological, and environmental char- acters that are describable in nonmentalistic terms. To deny that minds and bodies interact is to assert that the laws permitting us scientifically to explain human behavior need not mention anything mental. Parallelism and the belief in physical determinism form the basis for the objectivist belief that a complete account of human activities can be given in nonmentalistic terms. Some philosophical problems arise because certain sets of facts, taken together, are perplexing. In the present instance, the commonsense fact, upon which the mentalists rightly insist, that mind and intelligence make a difference in the world seems to conflict with the denial of causal interaction between mind and body. Yet this denial is justified by what we know from the natural sciences. This is what makes it a piece of scientific common sense. To deny it outright is to tilt quixotically at wind mills. The contemporary mentalist does not deny it outright. Instead, he denies its relevance, by asserting that scientific, that is, causal explanation and description are "inappropriate" to the explanation and description of human activities. He accepts physical determinism for physical events, agrees and even insists that both cause and effect must be physical, but, denying that human actions can be completely described in physical terms, denies that causal attribution can legitimately be made to actions. Bodies and minds neither interact nor don't interact. Rather, there is a sort of paral- lelism between mind and body, reflected by two different realms of discourse or ccconceptual systems," one for the mental, the other for the physical. Within each realm of discourse, different sorts of explanation are appropriate. We understand man by mentalistic explanation, for instance, by motives; we understand body by physical explanation, that is, by causes. The attempt to replace the former by the latter is a "conceptual" error, a priori doomed to failure. Even granting such a "conceptual" parallelism, an action, like signalling or buying a house, is an event taking place at a particular time. Actions are as much facts in the world as earthquakes or any natural phenomenon in which mind does not play a role. A world with actions is different from one without them. Questions about actions, therefore, cannot merely be linguistic, for the conceptual systems in which action- terms occur, if they are to be of any relevance, must be about actual occurrences, in exactly the same sense as conceptual systems of physics are not speculative fancies but about physical occurrences. Two kinds of questions, in particular, that may be asked regarding any event cannot arbitrarily be ruled out on linguistic grounds alone. For one, one may ask whether action-events have causes, for there is nothing in the</page><page sequence="6">314 MAY BRODBECK meaning of 'cause', as that term is normally used in science, to make this question in any sense "ungrammatical." The denial of interactionism does not follow from the meaning of 'cause', but from facts and laws of the kind I mentioned. It could be false, but it is not linguistic nonsense. Moreover, since actions are events, one may also legitimately ask how we know when statements about them are true or false. The answer given, as I mentioned earlier, is that all such statements are "conceptually," hence a priori, true. The prima facie rationalism of this answer to questions about matters of fact may, with some justice, lead one to suspect that something has gone radically wrong. Later, I shall try to locate what has gone wrong. On the positive side, there is at least one sense in which the mentalists are certainly right in asserting that talk about actions or, for that matter, motives cannot have the same "meaning" as talk about behavior or, for that matter, causes. For such statements have, at the very least, different intentional meanings. The objectivist must show h.ow, eschewing mentalistic terms, he can account for this difference in (intentional) meaning3. And, since actions are events, he must also show how parallelism allows him to account adequately for the presence and efficacy of mind in the world. I shall first suggest how, within his framework, the objectivist can in principle accomplish this first goal and, then, by considering certain mentalistic objections, show how he can in principle also accomplish the second. To every mental event there corresponds one or, more likely, several material events. What occurs when Jones sees a tree ? There are the mental act of seeing, certain states of his body and, presumably, a tree in his immediate environment. When Jones says, "I see a tree," he describes directly his mental state. The objectivist scientist cannot do this, since the mentalistic term is not part of his vocabulary This does not mean that Jones describes the situation for him. Jones' utterance is just part of the total situation that the scientist must describe in his own language In his language, which is in principle different from that of his subject, he introduces an inseparable complex term 'seeing-a-tree', which contains neither 'seeing' nor, for that matter, 'tree'. This term is defined dispositionally by means of terms referring to those physical states of the person (including his verbal behavior if asked what he sees) that accompany Jones' state of consciousness when he sees a tree. Although Jones' term 'see' refers to a conscious state and the scientist's complex term 'sees-a-tree' refers to behavioral and environmental items, the latter term will be truly applicable to Jones if and only if Jones is in fact at that time seeing a tree. He knows this commonsensically, so to speak, not as a scientist. He knows it from self-examination when he applies the defined term to himself, or from what Jones tells him, though again, what Jones tells him is data, not description. The investigator may of course make mistakes. But his mistakes will reveal them- selves by failure of the predictions that he makes from his description. He will predict something different from Jones sees-a-tree, then from Jones sees-a-tiger. If Jones turns and runs, he may conclude that either he was wrong in applying his complex terms to Jones, or else he was wrong in defining 'seeing-a-tree' in the way he did. "Wrong" in the only way a definition can be wrong, namely, that it does not provide a significant term, that is, one that figures in confirmable laws. On the other hand, he might still be right. Jones might have a neurotic fear of trees. In that case, he has failed to take account of other operative factors. If he is right and, in principle, there is always a right physical description corresponding to the mental event, then we may speak of the former as an indirect reference to the latter. Analogously, the physicist indirectly refers to the perceptual color red when he speaks of "the color with the</page><page sequence="7">MEANING AND ACTION 315 longest wave length." Seen in this way, objectivism is merely a way of talking about minds. By capturing its reflection in the material world, the behavior scientist can indirectly speak about mind. What then is the reflection of intentional meaning? Meaning1 (reference) and meaning2 (significance) are applicable to the technical terms of science. Terms and expressions have meaning for persons. When the scientist investigates this "meaning," then 'meaning' becomes one of his technical terms, call it psychological meaning or meaning4. Meaning4 is thus a term within science, which must itself be given meaning13a. Certain physical patterns have meaning4 for an indi- vidual. Depending upon the circumstances and manner in which it is uttered, the sound 'fire' for instance may mean4 to Jones either danger or warmth. Which it means4, we determine by the bodily states, behavioral and physiological, that hearing the word elicits in Jones. Generally, 'meaning4' refers to, or means1, certain other things, verbal or nonverbal, that a person does upon hearing sounds or seeing certain marks. Jones' awareness of the referential use, if any, of the expression he hears is an essential part of the situation to which he reacts. But an expression need not have (referential) meaning1, in order for it to have (psychological) meaning4 for someone. 'The Lord is my shepherd' has no meaning1, but it has meaning4. People use it, utter it, and behave upon hearing or uttering it in certain ways. Similarly with many expres- sions of religion, poetry, exclamations, commands, and so forth. Being used on certain occasions, they have meaning4. As with 'seeing', so with 'meaning'. The psychologist's technical term occurs in a hyphenated expression, say, 'S-means-P-to-Jones', defined in terms of a certain disposi- tional relation holding between, first, the sounds S and Jones, he hears them, and, secondly, certain later states of Jones' body. Just as neither 'see' nor 'tree' occurs in seeing-a-tree', so neither'S' nor 'means' occurs in 'S-means-P-to-Jones'. To put it differently, since S is a pattern of sounds and P a pattern of bodily states, verbal re- sponses, and overt behavior, no substitution can occur in the hyphenated expression.3 Therefore, from the fact that two expressions, two patterns of sounds, may both be used to refer to the same states of affairs, it does not follow that they both mean4 the same to Jones. The intentional uniqueness of concepts is reflected by their having different linguistic texts. The observable responses to two different expressions may be different. (Psychological) meaning4 depends, in other words, not only upon what is being asserted, but also upon the linguistic form in which it is asserted. This uniqueness of meaning4, objectively defined, of linguistic expressions-experimentally established, by the way-reflects the uniqueness of (intentional) meaning3 of thought or concepts. The shadow, if not the substance, of intentionality can thus be captured by the objectivist. Before considering certain objections to this optimistic objectivist tale, it will be helpful to sort out some uses of 'understand'. I shall indicate the various uses by subscripts. The contexts in which these subscript-terms occur will explicate their uses. I can understand1 English but not Finnish. To understand a language is to know how to use certain classes of sounds or marks to express and to convey to others our thoughts, attitudes, queries, wishes, and, among other things, information about the world. To accomplish this, I must know the conditions for applying certain expressions and not others. What is involved in understanding1 varies with the kind of expression. Some I understand1 only in context when they are combined with other terms. 3 See also Grossmann, [5]. 3a Meaning4 and meaning2 may both be called 'contextual meaning'; but meaning2, like meaning,, is applicable to scientific terms, including meaning4.</page><page sequence="8">316 MAY BRODBECK Clearly, we could not use or understand, a language if all of its terms were under- stood only in context by means of other terms. Armed only with a wholly Finnish dictionary, I could not understand, Finnish. Some expressions, therefore, I under- stand, only if I know what conditions of myself, the world, or other people they are being used to express, that is, only if I know their (referential) meaning1. I do not understand2 what it meant to have been a member of the Italian Resistance. Nor do I understand2 what it means to lose an only son. This sense of 'understanding' has nothing to do with language, for of course I understand, what it is that I am said not to understand2. I do not understand2 these things because I have not had the special feelings, emotions, or attitudes that are aroused only by having undergone certain experiences or participated in certain kinds of events. Toward those who have my empathy is limited in a way it is not limited toward people with toothaches. For I understand2 what it is to have a toothache. Understanding2 is a mixture of knowing meaning, and meaning2. I must know to what unique feelings, of pain or of grief, the terms are being used to refer, or, as in the case of being a member of the Italian Resistance, I must know what feelings were associated with those underground activities referred to by the term. I do understand3 what it meant to be a member of the Resistance, just as I under- stand3 what a golden mountain would be like. The unique phenomenological expe- rience that is the resultant of fear, patriotism, courage, hatred of tyranny, all acting jointly, I do not understand2. But, because I understand, the meaning1 of the phrase 'being a member of the Italian Resistance' and because I also understand2 the meaning of fear, patriotism, and so on, I can understand3 what it meant to be a member of the Resistance. In this sense too, since I have suffered the loss of loved ones, I can understand3 what it means to have lost an only son, though I have never had a son. By understanding3 one may empathize with the bereaved mother, though less com- pletely than one who understands2, that is, one who has also lost a son. I understand4 why Tom Jones left school; he wanted to make a lot of money quickly. If we know the motives and purposes of people's actions, then we under- stand4 why people did what they did. Here we must distinguish between under- standing, the action-term, that is, knowing to what the term is referring, and knowing the motive for the action. The purposes, duties, and so on, mentioned in the description of the action will, of course, be different from the purpose for which the action is performed. I shall return to this distinction presently. (Below, pp. 320-22.) For the moment, let it stand that understanding4 consists in knowing motives. This may mean knowing what an action itself is or in knowing motives for it. I understand5 that increased costs of production mean an increase in selling price. The pious man understands5 that regular church attendance means salvation in after- life. The wife understood5 that her husband's silence meant disapproval. The farmer understands5 that a fiery red sunset means rain the next day. Generally, we under- stand5 a kind of thing, event, or behavior when we know or believe that there are some other things, events, and so on, with which it is in some way associated. In other words, we understand5 the meaning of something when it does not stand isolated, so to speak, before our minds. The "meaning" that we thus understand or attribute to events is what I called significance or meaning2. If we do not know the meaning2 of an event, then we do not understand5 the phenomenon referred to by the term expressing the occurrence. Again, I can understand, what I do not understand5. Obviously, this significance or meaning2 need not reflect any true connections among things. Yet, true or false, imaginary or superstitious, all of these occurrences of 'understand5'</page><page sequence="9">MEANING AND ACTION 317 are the same use, for they imply that one kind of thing is believed to be connected with something else. Understanding5 thus comprehends tested generalizations of science that give their terms significance, as well as the connections, whether from common experience or fancy, that people believe certain things have with others. When these associations of one thing with another actually do reflect empirical lawful connections, then understanding5 coincides with scientific explanation. There are of course other uses of 'explain'.4 I turn now to criticisms of the objectivist program. The mentalist claims that "understanding of society cannot be observational and experimental" ([8], p. 110) because, first of all, the investigator must understand the language of the people he studies. One learns a language by sharing a mode of life. The investigator, therefore, cannot stand in the observor-observed relation to his subject matter. Moreover, the natural scientist uses external criteria to decide when two events are of the same kind. But that two actions sharing no overt features are of the "same kind" must be decided by the participant, not the spectator. The method by which we understand others is accordingly subjective, not objective. Logically, therefore, there cannot be generaliza- tions about man and society, as there are about stones and stars. What is involved in the idea, for instance, of prayer is a religious not a sociological question. An idea cannot be torn out of context, for it gets its meaning from the role it plays in the system. Men's actions are intelligible when we understand their motives and the rules in accordance with which they act. But appeals to standards and to motives "rule out" appeals to causes. Mechanical, causal explanations of human actions are therefore logically inappropriate.5 Using the distinctions drawn among the various uses of 'meaning' and of 'understanding', I should like to examine these claims. Does the fact that the investigator must understand1 the language of the people he studies vitiate the objectivist thesis? By a fairly elaborate conditioning process, a child learns, say, to call a small, furry, meowing animal a cat, not a dog. He also learns to say "He was ..." not "He were ...". Pointing, obviously, is not the only method used in teaching a language. Nor can we teach the (referential) meaning1 of mentalistic terms, like 'headache' and 'sorrow', by pointing. These are learned by means of their public accompaniments. It is truistic that learning a language is "rooted in a social context." Far from vitiating the objectivist thesis, the truism is a fundamental part of it. Yet undoubtedly there is a difficulty. An almost infinite number of sound patterns can be used to express the same terms. Moreover, only slight oral or typo- graphical changes create huge differences in behavior. As the old "telegram-argument," frequently adduced by the idealists, insisted, there is an enormous difference between a telegram from a friend that says "Our son was killed" and one that reads "Your son was killed." The difference in (referential) meaning, and consequently in the reactions they arouse (meaning4) is hugely disproportionate to the slight typographical differ- ences between the marks on paper. A man presumably also reacts differently when he hears the words "I love you" than upon hearing "I love him." The considerable physical difference between 'you' and 'him' suggests how, in principle, the investigator could dispense with knowing a common language. And the argument on both sides is one of principle or "logic" only. Still, the enormous difficulty of correlating slight differences in physical cues with huge differences in behavior are obvious. In practice, these difficulties may well be 4 See also [4]. 5 Cf. [7], pp. 4, 12, et pass. and [8], pp. 78, 82, et pass. With respect to the ineliminability of mentalistic terms and the claim that motives cannot be causes, see also [6].</page><page sequence="10">318 MAY BRODBECK insuperable. In practice, therefore, except when he is actually studying (psychological) meaning4, the investigator simply assumes that he and the subject understand1 the same language. It is not hard to tell, in purely objective ways, whether or not a person understands1 what is being said to him. People behave very differently if they under- stand1 what is being said than if they do not. If two people understand1 the same language, presumably because they have both learned it in the same social context, then they can communicate with each other. There is nothing inherently subjective about the success or failure of this communication. Once we know from a prior and different investigation that a language is understoodl, its users may be observed. The fact that the scientist learns the language as a participant in the social process does not imply that he can never, so to speak, stop being a participant. To think that it does is to fall victim to the genetic fallacy. The mentalist confuses how we come to understand1 a statement of, say, a belief with using that understanding1, once learned, to observe that an individual has a certain belief or, at least, says he has. Most probably, in practice subject and scientist must, as we say, speak the same language. But our saying this leads to a second confusion, namely, between the scientist's language and that which he shares with the subject. For, as I mentioned earlier, in another sense they do not "speak the same language." The language that the scientist uses to describe what he learns about his subject is in principle not the same language that he may use to communicate with him. What Jones says (and what the investigator says to him in Jones' language) is part of what is going on, which the investigator describes in his own language. In other words, everything that Jones says occurs only within quotation marks in the investigator's language. The subject's use of, say, the term 'prayer' in certain ways and under specifiable conditions is an interesting and important, because meaningful2 or lawfully significant, part of the investigator's data. If the latter uses that term to describe what is going on, its "mea- ning" in any and all senses of 'meaning' will not be the same as the subject's term. The subject's concept of prayer will of course have an (intentional) meaning3 for him that it will not have for a nonreligious person and need not have for the inves- tigator. Only in this sense of 'meaning', is it even plausible to say that only the religious man can "make sense" of religion. The sociologist may understand5 religion without also understanding2 it. For the participant, 'attending church services regularly' means3,4 salvation in after-life. For the observor-scientist, the same behavior means2 something quite different, namely, certain other actions of the person and perhaps certain effects upon the community. A sociologist may call two patterns of behavior in different cultures 'baptism', or two other patterns 'marriage', even though the Christian "would not agree" they were the same, ([8], p. 108), not merely because they happen to have certain overt features in common, nor yet "arbitrarily," but because they are believed to be similarly connected to other aspects of behavior and society. To the economist, automobiles and human labor are both commodities, not because he is insensitive to human dignity, but because they have similar properties in relation to other things, such as supply and demand. In sum, the use of a common language for purposes of communication is not in itself "incompatible," as alleged, with the external observor-observed point of view. To what are we referring when we use such terms as 'a smile,' 'a salute,' or 'money'? A salute, surely, had better be something observable. A smile is, according to Webster, a brightening of the eyes and upward curving of the corners of the mouth. Yet, a salute is more than a position of the hand. And to describe "writhing in pain" or Ccsigning a contract" is indeed more than to give a description "in purely mechanical</page><page sequence="11">MEANING AND ACTION 319 terms, using a set of space-time coordinates" ([8], p. 73 and [7], p. 13). "Money" is more than pieces of metal, paper, or beads. But is the "something more" of actions and artifacts only describable in nonphysical terms? One reason for thinking so is an invidious use of 'physical' in the narrow sense of that term. Such items as muscle- twitches, glandular secretions, shape and size are, on this usage, the only "physical" properties. But a pattern of overt behavior is also something physical, since it is certainly nonmental. A second reason for the belief that terms referring to actions and artifacts must mean, something "nonphysical" or "something more" than overt behavior is a mistaken notion of observable reference. On this usage, only manifest or "occurrent" characters are observable. But flexibility is no less observable than bent. Our everyday statements about actions are, as I mentioned before, mentalistic and categorical. But the scientific terms corresponding to these mentalistic ones, like cseeing-green' or 'meaning-p' are all dispositional. Dispositional characters merely require more complex observations than do manifest ones; they are no less observable. Actions, in one way or another, involve a reference to thought or purposes. An objectivist definition of 'purpose', corresponding to the mental state, can be con- structed. The difference between just "walking down the street" and doing so "in order to mail a letter" is not in what is presently observed, but a way of speaking about something else which we expect to occur later bringing this action to a close. Or, as with 'looking for' something, it may be a way of speaking about some past event which led to the present behavior or, possibly, some combination of things in the past and future. All this makes 'purpose' a more complex term than 'tall', but not on that account "nonphysical." Generally, a pattern of behavior observed in the past or to be observed in the future toward things and other people is the "something more" than present or manifest characters that is meant, by defined terms referring to actions. Social artifacts, like money, tools, and weapons, are defined by the behavior of people with respect to inanimate, material objects. In and of itself, a scarlet letter or a yellow arm-badge is no different in "meaning" from an iron cross or a purple heart. As material objects they are all equally "meaningless." What gives them (referential) meaning, as rewards or punishments is, of course, the behavior of people toward them. A cathedral is not just a pile of stones, not even just a pile of stones arranged in a certain pattern. 'Cathedral' (referentially) means1 a physical structure of a certain kind and certain ways people behave towards it, like entering it at certain intervals and performing certain activities, which the people, not the investigator, describe as worshipping. For the rest, the "meaning" of 'cathedral' is either the associations that people have to it, meaning4 (reflecting intentional meaning3), or else its meaning2, that is, its connections with other aspects of the culture, such as the kind of economy or other behaviors, like being charitable. Such connections among kinds of behavior are observable. The investigator's own past experience, aided perhaps by a class of judges, may be drawn upon to determine tentatively the identifying characteristics of, say, "friendly" behavior. But this usable past is not part of the criteria by which he now identifies the action. The belief that it is and thus requires "participation," confuses the origins of a classification with what that category now refers to. Not all of the past and future behaviors that are connected with, say, "friendly', but not with "hostile' actions, are part of the (referential) meaning, of the terms, only enough of them to distinguish friendly from hostile actions. How else could we assent to the proposition that a man may smile and smile, yet be a villain? It is true, even tautologically true, that "an idea gets its sense from the role it plays in a system" only if "meaning" is construed intentionally, as meaning3 (reflected by the psycho- 2</page><page sequence="12">320 MAY BRODBECK logist's meaning4), or, for scientific terms, as significance or meaning2. If I under- stand1 another person's language, I don't necessarily also know all the "meaning" that his terms carry for him. From understanding, alone, we do not ipso facto learn everything that any user of that language might associate with terms. This must be discovered. Nor need I know everything about a system of religious beliefs in order to know the meaning1 of 'baptism', any more than I need to know everything about an economic system is order to know the meaning1 of cmoney'. Neither to understand a language nor to know the meaning1 of its referential terms, need I know how every- thing is connected with everything else. I understand, the meaning1 of 'sell' and of cprice', both terms with complex definitions, without also understanding5 the con- nection between, say, selling price and cost price. Nor is the way they vary together merely a "conceptual" matter. Learning to use the word 'cost' does not entail learning all the laws of economics, any more than learning to use the word 'marriage' tells me all about marriage. Of course, to have "genuine understanding," if that means under- standing2, then one must be married. But "genuine understanding" may also mean knowing connections among things. And a bachelor sociologist's understanding5 of this meaning2, that is, the connections the institution of marriage has with, say, property-distribution, education, job-stability, and so on, may well exceed that of the most-often married person. Nor can he discover these things by analyzing the concept of marriage. The most one can thus discover, besides the legal definition of the term, is the (psychological) meaning4 it has for certain people, the gratifications and respon- sibilities they associate with it. For the meaning2 or significance of marriage he will have to grub among the facts. A pervasive fusion of the various meanings of 'meaning' and of 'understanding', lends a specious plausibility to the insistence upon the "total context" in order to grasp "meaning" and have "genuine understanding." What a term is used to refer to (meaning,) is confused, on the one hand, with the psychological associations (meanings3,4) we have to it and, on the other, with the lawful connections (meaning2) the object of reference has with other things. An uncritical use of "concept', blurs the distinction between our thought of something, "our idea of it," and the characteristics referred to by a term which is the text of that thought. Thoughts or concepts are sometimes also called "meanings." By spinning out these "meanings," we are said to "understand" human and social concepts, man and society. If we unpack the various uses of "meaning' and of "understanding', it is clear that at best such "conceptual analysis" can tell us what things (some) people think go together, not how things are actually connected. The difference between the action of raising my arm and the movement of my arm going up is that the former is done intentionally or for a purpose. The purpose need not be conscious; an action may be performed habitually, as reaching for a cigarette, or spontaneously, as jumping to dodge a car. In other words, there need not be any mental act present when performing an action. Automatic signalling for a left turn is also an action. However, a complete description of what was done, of the (referential) meaning, of 'signalling', requires mention of motives or purposes that are part of the action. Nor need these purposes be those of the person performing the action. Many of our actions require reference to a standard for complete description. To describe what is happening when a man tips his hat to a woman acquaintance requires a set of statements that mention, besides the regularity of his behavior, the presence in society of certain standards or norms. Norms don't exist by themselves; they ultimately involve mental acts. They may be explicated as, say, certain definite and durable</page><page sequence="13">MEANING AND ACTION 321 expectations that people in a society have about each other's behavior. 'Expectation', in turn, can be defined by certain dispositions, such as the imposition of penalties if certain behavior does not occur. The new recruit's salute is not yet habitual, but may well become so. What makes it "rule-governed," while the habit of chain-smoking is not, is the recruit's membership in a hierarchically-structured institution in which such behavior is "expected." Regularity of behavior under certain circumstances characterizes both "rule-governed" and merely habitual behavior. The "something more" in the former is the different way in which these regularities were acquired. The two expressions craising an arm' and 'arm going up' differ in "meaning" in all four senses of 'meaning", referentially, intentionally, psychologically, and in significance. In this sense, and so far as it goes, the mentalist's answer to Wittgenstein's question is correct. There is certainly difference in "meaning." The relevant differences, however, can be objectively construed without appealing to any vitiating participant "inside knowledge." In this respect, there is nothing about such terms marking them as "logically" different from those of natural science. Behind the rejection of so-called "mechanical" explanation seems to lie the notion that any explanation that does not use mentalistic terms in their mentalistic sense is "Emechanical," that is, is about movements in space, not about intelligent, purposive behavior. Partly, we have again the narrow use of 'physical', so that only the terms of physics and chemistry are physical or nonmental. But the definition of an action as a set of behavioral dispositions, bodily states, and environmental circumstances surely does not mention merely "movements." Nor, as I have suggested schematically in discussing 'purpose', is there any reason to believe that an objectivist account cannot be given of "intelligent" behavior, that is, the ability to vary behavior relative to a goal, under changing circumstances. Man of course "understands his situation," while a dog does not. This use of 'understanding' can be objectively construed by means of dispositional and occurrent factors present in and operating on the man but not the dog; for instance, his past learning of certain rules (standards and regularities) or his present awareness of them. To be sure, explanation by causes is only one use of 'explain'. Citing a motive also explains, as does giving a detailed description, as when we explain, say, the structure of feudalism ([47]). These different uses of 'explain', among others, also have their corresponding senses of 'understand'. They are not mutually incompatible. Which is "appropriate" depends upon what the person wants to know. Sometimes motives are causes, sometimes not. Buying a house is an action whose complete description in "neutral" or nonmentalistic terms would be quite complicated, requiring mention among other things of certain legal statutes. But an answer to why Jones bought a house might well state a motive, namely, a desire for privacy. This motive is hardly part of the (referential) meaning, of 'buying a house'. It is, though, part of its meaning2, that is, living in one's own house is a way of getting privacy. Here a motive is also a cause. Doubtless other (concurrent) causes are also operative. At other times, to cite a motive is not to give a cause but to tell what is happening, as when explaining what a signal or salute is. A reference to standards and motives will occur in the descriptions of these actions. But explaining what an action is and explaining why it occurred are two different things. Each may require mention of motives, though, of course, not the same ones. Jumping out a window is one action, of which the desire for death might be a cause. On the other hand, we would not say that a man committed suicide because he wanted to kill himself, since this wish is part of the (referential) meaning, of suicide.</page><page sequence="14">322 MAY BRODBECK Over-attention to cases of the latter kind perhaps is the source of a basic error that unfortunately pervades Melden's temperate and frequently illuminating book. He argues that a motive can never be a cause since, on good Hrumean principles, the cause must be logically distinct from the effect. He interprets this to imply that a description of the cause must not contain "any reference" to the effect. But 'wanting- to-do-X' mentions 'doing-X' and, generally, a description of a desire requires reference to the object desired. Hence, Melden concludes, they are not logically independent and motives cannot be causes for actions ([6], pp. 53, 114, 128). But there is no logical implication between wanting-to-do-X and actually doing X. The thought-of-snow- tomorrow means3 or intends snow tomorrow, but it does not logically entail that it will snow tomorrow. No more does the thought-of-doing-X logically entail doing-X. An adequate analysis of the nature of mental acts and how they are related to their intentions is indispensable. Although the relation of meaning3 between a thought and its intention is a logical one, the (occurrence of) thought itself no more entails its intention than, analogously, the logical relation "or' permits the deduction of 'q' from 'p or q'. A thought, after all, can mean3 what does not and never will exist. The mental act of wantinig-to-do-X is one fact. Doing-X is quite another and distinct fact. The former might on some occasions cause the latter. In some contexts standards and motives are causes; in some other contexts, they describe the action. Those enchanted by "rule-governed" behavior now tell us again and again that unless something is done in accordance with a rule, it is not really an action. This restriction has the odd consequence that a man may act purposively and yet not be doing anything. A married man making advances to a choir boy is not really doing anything, but instead has something "happening" to him ([7], p. 10). I see no warrant either in common usage or in common sense for this restrictive use of "action', based, at least in part, on a bad pun on "what is done" or "not done." Even granting the dubious doctrine that we only ask for a man's motives when he deviates from the "done" thing, we want the motives for his action, that is, for his purposive behavior, not for something, like a brick falling on his head, that merely happened to him. People are often punished for doing the "not done" thing, which is hardly reasonable if, like the brick, it just "'happened" to them. Freud indeed taught us how narrow is the line between what a man does and what happens to him. But it was, alas, the sphere of the latter, not that of the former, which he restricted. The distinction between the what and the why of actions is also relevant to the notion that causal explanations are only appropriate to our "deviations from norms" [7], p. 10) - (which, not quite incidentally, also may be instances of rational, pur- posive behavior). Partly, this view seems to stem from the fact that when we reply to a why-question by stating a norm, we often are explaining what is occurring, that being all the person wants to know. By definition, such an answer could not be given for "deviant" behavior. Even more fundamental is a pervasive equivocation between different uses of 'rule', once as a descriptive regularity and once as a prescriptive standard or norm. We do indeed consider that an insane man, incapable of judging between alternative courses of action, thus deviating from descriptively regular or normal human behavior, has things "?happen" to him that a normal man "does." A man who deviates from a prescriptive norm, however, is not necessarily insane. He may be the only sane one among us. On this possibly frivolous note, I conclude that the objectivist program emerges unscathed from the barrage of criticisms recently directed against it. Yet, some uneasiness about the objectivist thesis remains to be allayed. When all is said and done,</page><page sequence="15">MEANING AND ACTION 323 is the objectivist talking about the "same facts" as we describe in everyday mentalistic language ? Can talk about causes replace, without residue, talk about motives ? Can the scientist's non-interactionist account be made to accord with our commonsense (and clinical) belief that mind and body do affect each other ? As a final therapeutic step, it may pay to be explicit by distinguishing three uses of the phrase "same fact" that are relevant to this discussion. 1) Two statements may describe different states of affairs, yet be such that one of them is true (false) if and only if the other is also true (false). Such (synthetically) extensional equivalences may be said to express the same1 fact. In particular, if to any given statement about a person's motives or other mental states, there is another containing only physiological, behavioral, and environmental terms that is extensionally equivalent to the first, then they express the same1 fact. They do not mean the same either intentionally or referentially. The scientist's description, containing no terms referring to conscious states, thus "leaves out" minds. Talk about overt behavior and other physical items does not replace "without residue" talk about motives. On the other hand, since they express the same, fact, whenever the objectivist descrip- tion is true of anyone, a corresponding mentalistic account will also be true. 2) We can strengthen, beyond mere extensional equivalence, the use of "same fact". The term 'red', for instance, directly refers to a color. Light waves cause but are not colors. However, the descriptive phrase 'the color with the longest wave length' is a way of indirectly referring to the color red. 'The color of this book is red' and 'The color of this book is the color with the longest wave length' express the same2 fact. Similarly, a mentalistic term, like 'thinking-about-Italym' directly describes a state of consciousness, while its objectivist parallel 'thinking-about-Italyo' indirectly refers to this state. Generally, two different statements express the same2 fact, if the terms in which they differ are related to each other as direct and indirect descriptions or ways of referring. Since corresponding mentalistic and objectivist statements in this twofold way express the same1,2 facts, their "sameness" is stronger than the mere extensional equivalence of, say, 'Roses are red' and 'Sugar is sweet'. We say that mental anguish, for instance, anxiety, causes ulcers or that a bodily wound causes pain. Our common language is interactionist through and through. Extensional equivalence and direct versus indirect reference permit us to fit scientific parallelism with this piece of interactionist commonsense. On the objectivist account, a mental state can affect the body only through its corresponding physical state. But the objectivist termnanxietyo' is an indirect description of the mentalistic(anxiety"'. They may thus each be used to express the same2 fact. In particular, if it is true that anxietyo causes ulcers, we may also truly say that anxietym causes ulcers. The two causal attributions, the everyday interactionist one and that of the objectivist, are extensionally equivalent and express the same1 fact. Since they also express the same2 fact, there is more than mere extensional equivalence. We can thus make sense both of our commonsense interactionism as well as of its scientific denial. This is as it should be for, as we know, philosophy leaves everything as it is. 3) The statement-form 'P or Q' is logically equivalent to "not both not-P and not-Q'. By virtue of this tautology, 'Either Jones has a daughter or he has a son' expresses the same3 fact as It is not the case that Jones has neither a daughter nor a son'. Generally, two statements may be said to express the same3 fact, if they are logically, that is, tautologically equivalent, or, to say the same thing differently, if the statement of their equivalence is analytic. Statements containing terms directly referring to mental states are not tautologically equivalent to statements containing</page><page sequence="16">324 MAY BRODBECK their corresponding indirectly-referring objectivist terms. They do not therefore express the same3 facts. However, most if not all action and other social terms must be explicated, that is, given "real definitions" of their (referential) meaning1, whether in everyday speech or in science. Given such explications of usage, the terms, like Cowning property' or even 'behaving according to a standard', serve as abbreviatory expressions for the more complex ones. Statements containing the abbreviatory terms are then analytically 'equivalent to statements containing, in their place, the longer explicating expressions. They thus express the same3 fact. But even in such cases, the two expressions, the short and the long ones, would not have the same (intentional or associational) meanings3,4. Two expressions that are "logically" different in a use of 'logical' that encompasses and conflates several different ways that an expression can mean may yet be logically the same in a different and precise sense of 'logical'. The crucial terms in this controversy are 'meaning' and 'understanding'. Often in philosophical controversy, once several uses of certain crucial terms have been distinguished, little remains to argue about. Doubtless this happy outcome is too much to hope for now, though I hope that some contribution has at least been made to clarity about the issues at stake. I hazard the diagnosis that a vast irresolution about the status of mind lies at the root of the revived attempt to resolve empirical matters of fact "logically" or "conceptually." Unwilling to grant ontological status to mind, what properly belongs to mind, our thoughts or concepts, is projected on to the world. This is the road, not trodden for the first time, that leads to anthropomorphic rationalism. REFERENCES [1] BERGMANN, Gustav, Meaning and E.xistence (Wisconsin, 1959), pp. 3-38, 106-14.
