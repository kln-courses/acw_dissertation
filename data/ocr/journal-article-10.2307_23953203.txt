<plain_text><page sequence="1">16 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES PSALM X: A RECONSTRUCTION1 Psalm χ has perhaps more cruces than any other passage of equal length in the Hebrew Bible. Scarcely a line is free from obscurity. The first difficulty which confronts us is the alphabetical scheme. Unlike Ps. ix, which forms the first half of the whole poem, the acrostics in Ps. χ are far from easy to enucleate. Only the last verses, 12-18, exhibit in normal sequence the last four letters of the alphabet. One scholar has ingeniously claimed to discover a reversed alphabetical scheme (תשר״ק) in verses 1,3,5 0 ל כ)·* Biit his arguments have so far failed to convince, as he has not been able to carry his scheme through beyond these verses. The only place where I have retained the reversed form is in verses 7-8. Here, following MT, the develop ment of the thought seems to justify the precedence of the D-strophe over over the V-strophe.3 One of the remarkable features of this psalm is the number of times certain words and phrases recur. אמר בלבו occurs three times, in verses 6, 11, and 13. In my notes I have given reasons for the view that the phrase is also required in verse 4. One verse, 13, echoes and largely repeats the words in verse 4, thus providing a valuable clue as to the original form of the latter. The psalm is also notable for the number of times transitive verbs occur in which the object is implied rather than expressed. In order to facilitate comparison I have added a translation, which draws heavily upon R.V. wherever possible.

We should expect עלים® to be followed by an object like ךך ,עי|יןי|, or צקף¥· But the verb is here used elliptically, the object being implied rather than expressed. Other examples of such usage will be found in these notes. 2. I adopt the readings 5גאןתו (Olshausen) and לתפשו (Halevy).' 3. The emendation by Τ. K. Abbott (Z.A.W. xvi. 292) of מהלל for פי הלל (in order to supply the D-strophe) is improved by the suggestion of Professor G. R. Driver (privately made) of הלל!?. He translates the first stich of this verse, 'The wicked is frantic for his soul's desire'. ובצע ב?ע בדך] the reading of Ehrlich, ' and the covetous blesses gain'. 4. I follow G. R. Driver in the first stich (J.T.S. xliii. 151). In the second stich the phrase אמר בלבו is necessary to complete the sense. R.V., rightly sensing the difficulty, inserts ' saith'. A clue to the missing words which should not be overlooked is to be found in verse 13, which reproduces largely the phrasing of verse 4. בל־ידרש[בל־ידרש] sc. 'me׳. 5. I transfer אץ־אלהים כל־מזמותיו from its place as second stich in verse 4, where it is awkward, to form the second stich in verse 5, where it falls into its right place. As regards the translation, I transcribe the illuminating note sent to me by Prof. G. R. Driver: ' In ver. 5 "all his thoughts are, There is no God" seems to me impossible; this would require מחשבה, while מזמה is always "(evil) purpose, 1 Recherches bibltques, iii. 33.

For the pseudo anthropomorphic use of אלהים cp. Hebr. כסאן* אלהים "thy throne is God" = godlike (Ps. xlv. 7) and Ass. segarka aAnum, "thy word is the heaven-god" = "high as heaven" ("Creation" iv. 4).' מרום יכו׳] In order to supply the missing 0-strophe the emenda tion סרו (for מרום) was proposed by Τ. K. Abbott (Z.A.W. I.e. 292). This is on the right lines, but what is required is a passive rather than active meaning. To conceive of משפטים as 'departing' is a usage essentially alien to the peculiarly concrete literary genius of the writers of the Hebrew Bible. I therefore propose סורים in the sense of 'discarded', a verbal adjective of the katul form, like 0וךה in Isa.Isa. xlix. 21 (also Jer. ii. 21 andtheKere in Jer.xvii. 13). SeeKautzsch Cowley, Heb. Gram. § 72 p. 6. On the basis of previous emendations (Graetz, G. R. Driver)' I propose א*ירי לא לכרע 'my footstep will not falter', for the hope lessly corrupt אשר לא־ברע. In agreement with אמוט an imperfect form of כרע (with a future meaning) is indicated rather than the perfect. For the equally dubious אלה I suggest לה?. 7. I emend ומרמות to מרמות, which finds support in some Hebrew manuscripts (Kennicott), 'his mouth is full of deceit and oppression '. Delitzsch, who retains the taaw of ומרמות but transfers it to מלא renders 'deceit and oppression fill his mouth'. 7-8. I adhere to the sequence of the 6ן1^81-ע after the 11€^810-פ, following MT. חצרים] I adopt רצחים (G. R. Driver, privately), an improvement on Graetz's רצחים,* as it differentiates the casual murderer (0לצ) from the hardened one (.(!צח לצפנו] I adopt G. R. Driver's (J.T.S. 1. c. 152) ·לצפיץ לסרג] I adopt the reading, with some of the versions, of לסרג (Kittel-Kahle, Bibl. Hebr. 983). 9. יחטוף עגי] These words are best deleted (Buhl, with Peshltta and two Hebrew manuscripts cited by Kennicott). In the second stich a word like ילכדגו seems necessary both for the sake of the stress and the sense. 10. וגפל בעצומיו חלכאים] The plural חלכאים cannot be made to agree with the singular of וגפל. Ehrlich's suggestion that א(י)ם is a dittographic error due to the immediately following (אמ(ר is more 1 1. c., 152. * Kritischer Kommentar zu den Psalmen, 184.</page><page sequence="4">NOTES AND STUDIES 19 ingenious than convincing.1 I would render, ' and he [i.e. the צדיק] falls like helpless people', which in effect would = ' and he falls helpless'. The omission of the comparative particle 9 is found else where. See Kautzsch-Cowley, Hebr. Gram. § 141 d. בעצומיו[בעצומיו] 'by reason of his [the rashas] strength'. I take עצומים to be an abstract noun.1 12. אל is superfluous after יהרה, but may have originally appeared in the second stich, after אל־תשכח. It is tempting, however, to read with Gunkel אל־תשכח צעקת עניים for the second stich (cp. Ps. ix. 13) and to delete אל altogether. 14. This verse should be carefully studied for the light it throws upon the original form of verses 3-4. כי־אתה is, of course, im possible. The simplest (and most effective) emendation is to alter the vowels of אתה but not the consonants and to read אתה,' Thou hast seen (or seest) that mischief and spite are his' [literally, ' with him', i.e. the .[רשע תביט לתת 3ילף] Another crux, as 1תת? must have an object. I would suggest 1תת אותו? or (with the least possible alteration) . תביט לתתו would have the force of התו וכר (or תביט ליום (לעת, 'Thou waitest for (the time of) his delivery into thy hand(s)'. A tempting emendation would be תביט לתת לו בךךכיו ' Thou bidest thy time in order to requite him according to his ways'. This would postulate the dropping out of לו and the corruption כדרכיו into בידן״. (Allowing for the frequent confusion of ב with כ, four of the con sonants of כדרכיו are present in (.בידך עליך נעזב] sc.sc. יחו&lt;!? '(the helpless and the orphan) give free course to their complaint unto thee'. Cp. Job x. 1. 15. בל־ת?!ןנא] makes nonsense. A slight alteration converts בל to כלו ' (Thou wilt detect) all of it'. 17. תאות in the sense of 'desire' is unsuitable. One listens to a complaint, not to a desire. G. R. Driver on Ps. xxxviii. 10 (J.T.S. xliii. 153), proposes the translation 'all my lament' for כל־תאותי; here too this sense would suit the context admirably. תבין לבם] The suggestion of תכן for תבץ sounds intolerably prosy. ' Contents' is not a word redolent of poetry either in English or in its Hebrew equivalent. The emendation לבף seems more attractive.3 The meaning would then be, 'Thou inclinest thy heart to the complaint of the poor (or meek)'. 1 Die Psalmen, 1905, p. 21. 2 עצומים may thus be added to other examples of similar abstract nouns given by G. R. Driver, J.T.S. 1. c., 151. 3 See Ehrlich, Die Psalmen, 22. In the ancient alphabet כ (J) and י) מ^) resemble each other.</page><page sequence="5">2ο2ο THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES 18. 3ל־יו9יף עוד · · ·] The inclusion of עוד in the first stich makes it top-heavy. I would suggest transferring it to the second stich; יוסיף with לשפם would thus balance עוד with לערץ (G. R. Driver, privately). In sympathy with לשפם ,לעדץ must have the meaning of 'judge severely, punish'. The translation would therefore be, 'He shall no more judge harshly the fatherless and the oppressed: (Or) frighten again man off the earth'. Translation Translation ι Why standest thou far off, Ο Lord ? Why hidest thou in times of trouble ? 2 The wicked in his pride hotly pursueth the poor; He taketh him in the devices that he hath imagined. 3 The wicked is frantic for his soul's desire, And the covetous blesses gain. 4 In the height of his anger fie despiseth the Lord : He saith in his heart, 'He will not seek me out*. 5 His ways are firm at all times; All his purposes are godless. Thy judgements are rejected before him: As for all his adversaries, he puffeth at them. 6 He saith in his heart, I shall not be moved: To generation unto generation my footstep shall not falter. Selah. 7 His mouth is full of deceit and oppression: Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity. 8 He sitteth in the lurking places of murderers : In the covert places to slay the innocent. His eyes keep watch for the helpless: He lieth in wait in the covert like a lion in his lair. 9 He lieth in wait to seize the poor: He catcheth him by drawing him into his net, 10 The righteous is crushed, he sinketh down; And he falleth helpless by reason of his strength. 11 He saith in his heart, ' God hath forgotten : He hideth his face; he will never see'. 12 Arise, Ο Lord, lift up thine hand; Ο God, forget not the meek. 13 Wherefore doth the wicked despise God, And say in his heart, 'Thou wilt not seek me out' ? 14 Thou seest that mischief and spite are his: Thou waitest for his delivery into thy hand(s). Unto thee the hapless and the orphan give free course to their complaint; Thou hast ever been a helper.</page><page sequence="6">NOTES AND STUDIES 21 15 Break thou the arm of the wicked ; Thou wilt seek out his evil doing ; thou wilt find it all out. 16 The Lord is king for ever and ever : Nations are perished out of his land. 17 Thou hast heard, Ο Lord, the lament of the meek : Thou inclinest thy heart ; thou causest thy ear to listen. 18 He shall no more condemn the fatherless and the oppressed, Or frighten again man off the earth.
