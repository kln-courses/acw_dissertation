<plain_text><page sequence="1">LOWELL AS A POET OF NATURE So circumspect a critic as Mr. Brownell has recently said that Lowell's nature poetry is probably the best that America has contributed. Perhaps it is ; but many devotees of Emerson, or Whittier, or Whitman, would answer in the negative, and even if Thoreau's verse is halt, lame, and blind, his prose in Waiden and the fournal contains poetry of a high and durable order. In artistic form Lowell's verse unquestionably ranks first, yet if there is anything that Lowell was not, it is the artist : not one of his poems in which nature dominates has the ring and swing of the perfect lyric. In this matter of comparison, the artistic element seems to me therefore irrelevant. It will be necessary, in the romantic way, to concentrate on the "message," on the effectiveness of the emotion which nature rouses in the poet. From this point of view, however, nothing final can as yet be said. The modern nature cult, as Lowell himself observed, is largely the last refinement of a refined age ? primitivism, especially, is a token of over-cultivation?and the age is thus, in a measure, discredited in any endeavor it may make to estimate the real importance of its nature poets. But looking at the matter as clearly as possible, we are, I think, drawn to the con clusion that Emerson and Thoreau and Whitman will ever be poets for the few and Lowell and Whittier poets for the many; and further, if "communion with nature," a religious love of nature, be the characteristic attitude in years to come, the first three are most likely to dominate, whereas if a Chaucerian love of nature or a semi-classical view of nature (in which man is of central interest) be the attitude of the future, the last two will probably dominate. How far the present reaction against romanticism, which has as yet barely touched several of the arts, will carry us, no one can say; but in any case, Lowell, thanks to his avoidance of the eccentric and the tangential, seems less open to attack than Thoreau and other mystics and pseudo-mystics of America and England. Whatever may be Lowell's degree of excellence, in kind he seems fairly safe in any age. His devotion to nature was not</page><page sequence="2">Lowell as a Poet of Nature 423 complete or jealous, his love was not abandoned. There was nothing of the recluse, the cynic, the devotee of the tower of ivory in him, or if there was he persistently exorcised it. There was nothing of Whitman's lawless mysticism or of Jefferies's sentimental mysticism. Few men have had three such diverse passions in so high a degree : his country and its ideals, his books and the greatness of man celebrated in them, his Elmwood meadows and river with the delight and calm they afforded ? these three passions intermingled in him from his schoolboy days to his death. His patriotism naturally attained its climax at the time of the war, his love of literature culminated in his studies as a professor of Harvard College, and his love of nature, though it seemed to bring most delight to his boyhood years, brought its greatest calm and quiet joy in his latest years. In general, then, the three passions matured in a parallel way, and not one of them ever gave signs of waning. Of the three, the chief, perhaps, was his patriotism, or, to be more inclusive, his love of men. He loved his country more or less as an entity, but he loved also the individual man. Freedom ? no-slavery?and brother hood, a more fundamental word for the same conception, are the great motifs of Lowell's poetry. Nature is usually ancillary, illustrative. In his life, also, men were all-important: "Books are good dry forage," he wrote in a letter, "but, after all, men are the only fresh pasture." His letters are full of a wistful pleading affection? "I do like to be liked," "I would rather be loved than anything else in the world"?while his days were made happy by many close friendships, and he could boast that he had never lost a single friend. His love for his wife, Maria White, was passionate and solicitous, but so great was his craving for the support of affection that he married again some years after her death. When he went out among his fellow-men, the in difference of passing strangers could even bring tears to his eyes. Lowell would thus reverse the sentiment "I love not man the less, but nature more," and he would do so even in an age when the emphasis was on nature. From the documents of the past, his books, he extracted the wisdom of the great men of the ages; from the documents of the present, his friends, he derived the inspiration given by personal intimacy. Nature was subordinated</page><page sequence="3">424 The Sewanee Review to literature and to man. He inured himself in this wise against the aloofness and purposeless dreaming that only too often char acterize the romantic poet. He realized, it seems, the danger of lapsing into dreamy sensuousness if he devoted himself to nature solely. Even if he lacked the essentials of a great critic, he had a modicum of intellectuality, and he certainly possessed a large fund of Yankee common sense. Lowell had, it is obvious, the curbed and humanized, and yet enthusiastic, love of nature that seems essential for enduring literature. In gen eral kind, then, his poetry is of a sort that will live; it appears to be wanting, rather, in quality?in high poise, in individuality, in sincerity. Unconscious insincerity is perhaps the central trait of Lowell's poetry. Once or twice, as in the Commemoration Ode, he was able to concentrate his faculties upon a theme that had entirely possessed him; but in general his verse suffers from a hundred dis quieting influences, echoes from his aesthetic, philosophic, and reli gious doubts. Though an obvious disciple of Carlyle in his hatred of insincerity, he is never fully himself in his poetry, and even in his literary criticism suffers from the same lack of an internal cen tral authority. This constitutional insincerity involves the other two qualities that I have mentioned almost at random, lack of individuality and of high poise, and involves fundamentally any other qualities one may seek in him. There is unquestionably, in my opinion, an element of romantic irony in Lowell. He is inconsistent, not only outwardly, but in spirit. Heart and mind are never long at one. He exemplifies and violates his theories. From the calm heights of intellect he seems to look down upon the play of emotion within him, condemning much that he does even while he does it. Referring to his essay on Carlyle, he wrote to Leslie Stephen that he was perhaps harder on him than he meant, because he was "fighting against a secret partiality." He is always fighting against secret partialities. He scorns Pe trarch's sentimentalism, and Rousseau's for some reason to a less degree, and sentimentalism in general ; yet he had his period of Wertherism and never completely freed himself from it. He admits that, in common with Petrarch, Dante, Tasso, and Byron, he was "desperately in love" before he was ten years old and</page><page sequence="4">Lowell as a Poet of Nature 425 suffered pangs beyond our comprehension. At the age of eigh teen, he preferred poetry like that of Byron and Campbell, which can "bring tears to one's eyes." When twenty years old, he was on the point of enacting the conclusion of the Werther melo drama, but was unable to pull the trigger. At an indefinite period in his early years, he "was never a single night unvisited by visions." Tennyson's "Maud" made him, at the age of thirty six, break down "in the middle in a subdued passion of tears." Once when he was sick late in life he lost all consciousness of his flesh and was mixed with the Milky Way. All these phenomena he is inclined to attribute to his conscience, handed down by his "Puritan forbears" (ursa novanglica, he calls them). Yet this same victim of the Zeitgeist denounced as constantly as a prosy utilitarian everything tainted with sentimentalism. "I do abhor sentimentality from the bottom of my soul," he wrote when the death of his wife roused his deepest emotions. The "poetical temperament" really fascinated him; for though he never failed to express his contempt for it and its sensitiveness and fondness for "unnoticed nothings," one feels below the sur face an ever-recurring secret partiality. A letter which he wrote in 1866 to Charles Eliot Norton?one of his most inti mate correspondents?is worth quoting as illustrative of the shifting from heart to mind, the ebb and flow of impulse even as he wrote : ? The older I grow the more I am convinced that there are no satisfactions so deep and so permanent as our sympathies with outward nature. I have not said just what I meant, for we are thrilled even more by any spectacle of human heroism. But the others seem to bind our lives together by a more visible and unbroken chain of purifying and softening emotion. In this way the flowering of the buttercups is always a great and I may truly say religious event in my year. But I am talking too unguardedly. You know what a deep distrust I have of the poetical temperament, with its self-deception, its real unrealities, and its power of some times unblest magic, building its New Jerusalem in a sunset cloud rather than in a world of actuality and man. I find the words "convinced," "religious event," "unguardedly," "distrust," and "self-deception" especially suggestive. "How</page><page sequence="5">426 The Sewanee Review far can I trust my feelings?" is the overtone of all his work. It is this that produces the impression of insincerity in all he did. On the one hand is what Leslie Stephen called so well his "ine radicable boyishness" of spirit; on the other, his ineradicable in tellectual distrust. The religious outcome was a reliance on "motherly-tender" Earth; desire for faith in the Rock of Ages together with hatred of evolutionary science, which again was combined with an impulse toward acceptance of it because of his love of reason ; and finally, a preference of the Church of Eng land service. The union, or disunion, of these elements was far from unique among nineteenth-century poets, but unfortunately in Lowell no one of the elements dominated long enough for him to produce really sincere, spontaneous work. What seems most regrettable in Lowell's unending shift from boyish gusto to intellectual distrust is the fact that at bottom he was delightfully masculine. He refers justly to an "immense ballast of common-sense" which he carries. In reading Grote's History of Greece, he finds his "prosy good sense medicinal," his "honest incapacity of imagination singularly soothing." Lowell's own prose style is distinctly masculine. It is full of energy, and never languishes. His remarks are, for one thing, replete with words of action. Writing to Holmes, whose book on Emerson he had just read, he commented in this wise: "There are admirable things in the chapter about Emerson's poetry, many that made me slap my thigh with emphatic enjoyment. You say the book tired you, but I see no sign of it, and your wind is firm to the end. I thank you for helping me to a con clusion I was fumbling for" That is scarcely the style of a dreamer in a perfumed tower of ivory. Physically, Lowell was as robust as a cab-driver (he would have relished the compari son). In his honeymoon days at Baltimore, he was so red cheeked that it seemed to him he must have scraped all the brick walls in the town. Throughout his life he enjoyed fishing, sailing, and winter walks in the teeth of a gale; and for some years he went annually to the Adirondacks, where, according to Thoreau, he at least shot a bear. The possibility of an unearned increment in flesh vexed him into "three hundred strokes with a pair of twenty-four pound dumb-bells every morning and</page><page sequence="6">Lowell as a Poet of Nature 427 evening"; nor did other nightcaps fail to interest him. Those who knew him personally are agreed that he was very much alive, thoroughly wholesome, and a brilliant talker. Lowell was no sentimental dreamer, but a man of action,? a lover of out door exercise, a tireless student, an abolitionist leader, and min ister to Spain and England. Disagreeing with some general remarks in Mr. Greenslet's de lightful biography of Lowell, Mr. Brownell says, rightly I think, "There is no more the mystic, than there is a morbid, note in his composition." The essential manliness of Lowell seems to me un questionable. One may say of him, as of many literary figures, that his merits were his own, his faults those of his age; or to put the matter otherwise, he used to his disadvantage what the nine teenth century gave him. He was never at one with himself; he really liked Rousseau and Wordsworth and Thoreau, but his intellect and wide reading told him that romanticism had gone too far, and he enlisted in the opposition. Yet he lacked the poise of Matthew Arnold, for instance, whose writings he disliked because of the suggestion of a clear, cold winter day in them. Born into a spontaneous century, Lowell might have been either a great critic or a great poet, more likely the latter; born into a conscious century, he had its consciousness at all times, and in prose and verse was never quite genuine. One phase of nineteenth-century consciousness deserves a few words of special attention. The century was one of wide and wise erudition. The classics, the Oriental literatures, the writings of the Middle Ages, were carefully studied and sympathetically interpreted. Dante and Calder?n were the objects of deep regard. The Elizabethans were read and lauded as never before. It was a century of books as well as of nature. In America, this literary trend was exemplified best by Lowell, the foremost humanist of our Renaissance. He read incessantly; his library at Elmwood was almost a sanctuary?the incense tobacco. He knew the classics, read fluently French, German, Spanish, and Italian. Shakespeare and the lesser Elizabethans, Spenser, Wordsworth, Dante, Calder?n, and the romances of the Middle Ages, were his favorites : a goodly host of whom he never tried. His library was remarkable for the time. He read for many hours at a</page><page sequence="7">428 The Sewanee Review stretch, and carried bookishness with him wherever he went. His prose is notoriously clogged with na?ve and recondite allusions,1 his verse is full or echoes of substance and manner. Whitman was not far from the truth when he felt that Lowell's poems did not grow, but were built. Lowell himself realized the obstacle that study interposed between him and expression ; more than once in his letters he intimates that he has "estranged the muse by donning a professor's gown." In his most exalted moments, I fancy, Lowell had lurking in his mind a consciousness of what the centuries had done. If he expressed rapture, it was not with the instinctive restraint of the artist, but with a conscious restraint determined by the reading of the classics of literature. As a poet of nature, then, Lowell's inborn enthusiasm suffers from many sorts of consciousness. Not only bookishness ? the sense of what the masters have done?but also an intellectual distrust, with countless ramifications, modified seriously the work which he produced. We shall see, in examining that work, just what these modifications were. But first we shall find it profitable to survey the observation and knowledge of nature which Lowell manifested, and to point out the aspects of nature that particularly attracted him. We shall thus discern dimly what his work might have been but for his unwitting insincerity. I What The Wakes was to Gilbert White of Selborne, Elmwood was to Lowell. If he travelled farther than White, he travelled not much oftener, and returned to his home if anything even more eagerly. "I like Cambridge better than any other spot of the earth's surface," he wrote to his friend Norton, then abroad. When he himself was abroad he was often unhappy with a sense of homesickness ? an oppressive emptiness of the heart that could not be relieved by social intercourse or by travel. "I shall not overstay my two years by a single day if I can help it," he wrote in 1873 when he was abroad preparing for his Harvard professorship. He felt like an exile when in Italy, and as he passed into Germany was elated at the sight of northern 1 In his nature essay, " My Garden Acquaintance," Lowell embellishes forty-one birds with forty-eight allusions.</page><page sequence="8">Lowell as a Poet of Nature 429 vegetation ? firs and pines and mountain-ashes. Nor was he really happy in France and Germany: "the buttercups stare at me as a stranger and the birds have a foreign accent. I'll be hanged but the very clouds put on strange looks to thwart me." Once back in Massachusetts, he was not satisfied unless he could stay at Elmwood; writing from Southborough he said: "I am one of those men who depend greatly on the kind offices of the genius loci, and am a good while in winning the confidences of a new one. I am just getting on speaking terms with the shy little fellow who has charge of the hills and pastures and wood paths here," and he fears that he cannot write in the alien land of Boston ? only three miles from his Elmwood ! Writing to Thomas Bailey Aldrich, who was occupying Elmwood in 1873, ne warned him : " It will make a frightful conservative of you before you know it. It was born a Tory and will die so.I often wish I had not grown into it so. I am not happy anywhere else." In his love of home, Lowell was a typical New Englander of his time. Emerson was firmly planted in Concord, Thoreau lost his intimacy with nature when he left his native village, Long fellow belonged to his adopted town, Holmes loved Boston as Dr. Johnson loved London. But Lowell's love was far more definite ? it was not his village, but his house that was indispens able to his existence. One can imagine his consternation when fire attacked it, fortunately without serious results. And unques tionably the Elmwood of his day was worthy of affection. The house itself is roomy, and comely enough, and even to-day the surroundings are pleasant. But fifty years ago, when Cambridge was still scarcely more than a village, the fields roundabout had not yet been disturbed and the marshes still afforded crops of hay. From the upper windows one could see the broad pasture lands extending to the elms and spires of the town, and to the right the Charles quietly curving though salt marshes, with a mast or two at the edge, and Corey's Hill a mile back. Not far behind the house lay Fresh Pond, blue or gray as the sky willed, imbedded in green woods and piny fields. English elms, walnuts, button-woods, pines, cherry-trees, smoke-trees, and many more surrounded the house, giving it in summer "a cool and rustling privacy of leaves," filled with birds and bird-song?ori</page><page sequence="9">430 The Sewanee Review oles, robins, jays, catbirds, and countless others?and the perfume of honeysuckle, roses, sweet peas, and lilac bushes. Here he enjoyed transparent northwesterly days in early summer, the haze and color of autumn, driving fog and rain laden with the salt of the sea, landscapes of virgin snow still and shining under the full moon. Elmwood deserved the love Lowell gave it. A study of Lowell's attitude toward nature is thus concerned chiefly with the gentle country surrounding Elmwood. He spent some time on the Massachusetts coast, in Maine, in the Adirondacks, in the West, in Italy, and in England. Several times he accompanied Leslie Stephen to Land's End ; ten or more summers he whiled away at Whitby, the watering-place of the North. But mountains and seashore, after all, meant little to him. He had in many ways an eighteenth-century love of nature ; for nature dominated by man gave him as much delight as he craved, and the "mountain gloom" and the solitude of the ocean seemed to repel him. In his poetry he employed the ocean often ; but it was always the ocean from the shore, to him the only fit place for real enjoyment of the sea, as he has indi cated in the opening sentence of his Italian journal. To* be sure, he wrote to a friend, "We sea-board fellows cannot live long without snuffing salt-water." But the sea as thus detected at Elmwood, or at best the sea as he knew it at the Isles of Shoals, amply sufficed him : in mid-ocean he was frankly bored. Of the four seasons, Lowell was most fond of summer, espe cially early summer ? when "the trees are all alive with the west wind" and the birds are singing and nesting in them. Spring was too fickle, perhaps too sentimental, for him ; autumn invited moods and preluded decay. Winter he liked, however,? the buffeting wind, the misty, dancing multitudinous snow-fall and the re fulgent fields when the sun blazed from a pale sky. He wrote an elaborate defense of winter,?forgetting, perhaps, that English are not American winters. He treated autumn in "An Indian-Summer Reverie," a tiresome poem patched with purple. But summer^? June particularly?he celebrated again and again, most notably in "Sir Launfal" and "My Garden Acquaintance." From these facts we may corroborate an impression received from a reading of Lowell's poems ? that he was most fond of the part of the year</page><page sequence="10">Lowell as a Poet of Nature 431 when nature is at her "high-tide." He did not seek inspiration on the ocean or in mountainous country, where nature rules man, nor did he seek it in the subtleties of spring and autumn ; his predilection was for a humanized landscape replete with light and vivacity. Joy is the effect produced on him by nature, a " pagan sensuousness" commonly devoid of thought or aspiration. To enter into the joy of nature was his desire, to luxuriate in the sunshine, to feel the soft lapping of the summer breeze coming over the meadows with the fragrance of buttercups and clover and the tinkling rapture of the bobolink. He was distinctly the poet of June. If we turn to the particular phases of nature treated in his poetry ? the birds, trees, flowers, insects, and the like ? we shall see that he was fondest of trees, singularly thoughtless and healthy creatures, and of birds, joyous and tuneful beings that live in healthy trees. The flowery meadows about Elmwood were, of course, full of insects, butterflies especially; yet in all his poetry I find but two references to butterflies, one in the service of a moral, the other, a yellow butterfly, in the service of a picture. The cricket, an incessant chirper of these same meadows, receives a bonus of three words: "The cricket chirps." The cicada, though prominent in Cambridge from July to November, he mentions but twice, under the vulgar name of "locust." The dragon-fly fares a little better; he gets a simile "Though Love's May time be as brief as a dragon-fly's repose," and the blue "swamp-fly" occurs twice. The firefly is even more fortunate. In addition to several brief descriptions, Lowell uses this fitfully gleaming wanderer in a poem on anthropomorphism ; the firefly does not so much as question that the lightning flashes of the sky "Are made, a fool could understand, By some superior kind of fly. Finally, "the buccaneering bee" buzzes in the lilies, clover, and linden-trees of every volume ? in all sixteen times, four times as often as his nearest insect rival. In general, then, the insects of Elmwood eluded Lowell's observation. Like most people, he observed closely only what interested him, and his love of nature was not particular enough to find a unique delight in each species of insect. Really, only the firefly and dragon-fly seem to have attracted</page><page sequence="11">432 The Sewanee Review his more particular attention. He did not, apparently, care to peep and entomologize. As for the bee, despite his constant use of this insect, it is clear that he had no comradeship with it; very likely he used it so often because it is a conventional subject of similes in English classical poetry. The small fur-bearing animals of Elmwood do not occur often in Lowell's poetry. There is a "slow water-rat" in one of his early poems, and a stanza-long chipmunk in the "Indian-Summer Reverie." But there are no woodchucks, weasels, moles, and what is more surprising, no squirrels. The electric twitches which the red squirrel can put into his tail should have won Lowell's esteem; but then, as he recorded in "My Garden Acqaintance," the squirrel is inclined to look twice at birds' eggs. A trained botanist could have named a host of wild flowers in the Elmwood country of that day, but only a small number of them blossom fitfully in Lowell's poetry. Typical New England flowers are rare : there are the pond-lily, dandelion, buttercup, clover, daisy, aster, bloodroot (sanguinaria seemed more poetic), hardhack, goldenrod, succory, and a few others, but most of these are mentioned only once. The glory of late summer in New England, goldenrod, occurs only in a brief list of flowers, and then perhaps merely to supply a rhyme for "sod." The dandelion is favored with a poem of that name, a poem of con siderable merit ; yet I have a lurking suspicion that Lowell is here the critic, or the advocate, a suspicion given weight by his almost utter neglect of the flower elsewhere. Lowell's only genuine love among the flowers is, I think, the buttercup. It symbolizes June ; it brims over with the fulness of summer, shines brilliantly, and plays with the breezes. The counterpart of the bee among the flowers is the rose, a favorite in classical poetry and Lowell's regular recourse when he wants a flower figure. Even more constantly do we find the violet, a conventional flower in romantic poetry, which appropriately enough decorates most notably Lowell's early and romantic verse?six times in his first eighty pages and in the five hundred later pages only six times more. Lowell's knowledge of flowers was manifestly limited, and his use of them rarely individual. With the trees and birds of his poetry it is otherwise.</page><page sequence="12">Lowell as a Poet of Nature 433 Lowell might well have found six or eight trees sufficient for his not very considerable body of nature poetry, yet he used more than twenty?eighteen in the first volume alone. Though it ordinarily seemed to him inadvisable to give exact names, he mentioned not only pines, but yellow pines, not only oaks, but swamp-, red-, and scrub-oaks. The tree of Transcendental New England, the white pine, looms up mournfully again and again, now singing "old songs of the brine," now shedding its needles profusely and silently. "Pine-dark solitudes, With soft brown silence carpeted" he invaded when he sought the Muse, just as Emerson and Thoreau did. But it is a significant fact that he used the pine as often in his first volume as in all his remaining work together : it was naturally the tree, just as the violet was the flower, of his more sentimental years. Later he devoted one entire poem "To a White Pine" which had impressed him on his trip to the Moosehead country: ? Far up on Katahdin thou towerest, Purple-blue with the distance and vast. Though very little of this lyric is spontaneous, the last two stanzas are interesting, in their still, pictorial intensity, as showing Lowell at his closest to the wilder aspects of nature ? to the majesty of the pine on the mountain crest: ? Thou alone know'st the splendor of winter, Mid thy snow-silvered, hushed precipices, Hearing crags of green ice groan and splinter, And then plunge down the muffled abysses In the quiet of midnight. Thou alone know'st the glory of summer, Gazing down on thy broad seas of forest, On thy subjects that send a proud murmur Up to thee, to their sachem, who towerest From thy bleak throne to heaven. But, after all, Lowell was not mystical enough for a true love of the white pine : his intimate trees were rather the elm and birch. Unlike the pine, the elm is mentioned as often in the last volume as in the first : Lowell never tired of the tree that graced and named his house. Now his emphasis is on the leaves "dark and dewy," now on the "elm's straight stem," again on the general effect, when he sees the moon ? Through leaf-fringed abbey-arches of the elms Curve her mild sickle in the West. 28</page><page sequence="13">434 The Sewanee Review He loved the elm somewhat as he loved the rich arches of a Gothic cathedral, and in a more personal way as the home of his spirited orioles. But though the elm recurs constantly in his poetry, it was perhaps too close to him to win the prominence given the birch. Mentioned but thrice in all his poetry (the elm was used eleven times), the birch yet received a liberal share of his im agination and fancy. Lowell was seldom more sympathetic than when he wrote the phrase "its tremulous hair," and the entire poem called "The Birch-Tree." In that poem, the best in some ways of Lowell's nature work, the birch is given a lasting place in American literature. It is so familiar that it scarcely deserves quotation here ; yet I would remark in passing that save in bits of verse here and there Lowell never surpassed the second and third stanzas of the poem. Lowell's acquaintance with the trees of the Elmwood country was, then, at once extensive and intimate. Their size, their permanence, their swaying branches and rippling leaves, their fulness of life, attracted him far more than the humble flowers of his neighborhood, and less only than the birds. In "My Garden Acquaintance" Lowell mentioned forty-one birds. The emphasis on birds in this essay is due, however, not only to the fact that they are more prone to wander into gardens than alien flowers and trees, but also to the fact that Lowell was fonder of them than of the inanimate objects of the natural world. In his poems likewise (curiously enough) he mentioned forty-one species (a half-dozen of them English, however). Though I have not catalogued Wordsworth's birds, I suspect that in his eight volumes he finds use for a number considerably below forty-one. A significant inference presents itself : whereas Wordsworth was interested, not so much in the names and ways of birds and flowers as in the emotions roused by natural objects in general, or by any natural object, Lowell, in the mood of the amateur naturalist or of the critic, was interested almost as much in names and ways as in emotions. In his first volume alone I find seven teen birds (many of them several times) ; and the remaining twenty-four flutter in at short intervals in his later work. He was never at a loss for the proper bird in a given picture or figure of speech. Had he written four more volumes, I dare say a</page><page sequence="14">Lowell as a Poet of Nature 435 fair number of newcomers would have sung for him. He used not only the conventional birds of poetry and the everyday birds of the farmer's acquaintance, but also species unknown save by those who look for them ; not only swans, larks, and robins, but also chewinks, chickadees, cliff-swallows, coots, sparrow-hawks, wood-thrushes, and hermit-thrushes, while in his Elmwood essay he named as old friends cross-bills, rose-breasted grosbeaks, tree sparrows, Wilson's thrushes, pewees, and cliff-, bank-, barn-, and chimney-swallows. In range, therefore, Lowell's observation of birds was rather unusual : and he was not wanting in accuracy or sympathy. In early summer, when some of the late migrants have not yet passed on to their nesting grounds, he watches a retired bird : ? Through the dim arbor, himself more dim, Silently hops the hermit-thrush, The withered leaves keep dumb for him. Nowhere else in American literature do we see so perfectly ? The bluebird, shifting his light load of song From post to post along the cheerless fence. Indeed, what chiefly made Lowell's observation so accurate was his sympathy. As I have already remarked, he loved light and vivacity in nature ? the flooding light that makes early June in New England memorable, the vivacity of wind-enlivened trees and of incessantly active birds. He cared less for "tranced summer-nights" when? Tall oaks, branch-charmed by the earnest stars, Dream, and so dream all night without a star? than for rapturous summer days when the willow, "friend of all the winds,"? Glints his steely aglets in the sun, Or whitens fitfully with sudden bloom Of leaves breeze-lifted. Similiarly, he cared less for the ethereal chanting of our thrushes than for the confused, ecstatic music of the thrasher, catbird, and bobolink. In England he turned traitor for a time, in sisting that the nightingale and blackbird "beat any of ours,"? traitor to our birds, not to the sort of song he liked,?but back</page><page sequence="15">436 The Sewanee Review at Elmwood he usually held the bobolink "the best singer in the world, even undervaluing the lark and the nightingle in the com parison"; "that liquid tinkle of theirs is the true fountain of youth if one can only drink it with the right ears, and I always date the New Year from the day of my first draught." Every thing in spring is prelusive to the bobolink, and summer has lost its crowning glory when he becomes silent. Yet for some reason the bobolink occurs but three times in Lowell's poetry. Second in his esteem is the oriole; in every one of nine cases it is associated with the elms that stood guard along the lane. He envied the oriole its happy life in the elm-tops, and admired its "note, rich as the orange of his throat." The catbird was another favorite, who sang delightfully in the syringa thicket? a "season-ticket" to his music affords the rhyme; but he suf fered in comparison with Calder?n, who sang "a music of all moods and climes." The ph be, though it gets a whole poem all to itself, was, I think, no favorite of Lowell's. That poem was written abroad; it voices his homesickness, an estimable but ineffective emotion as Lowell expressed it; the ph be's song, echoing in his memory, is rife? With longings unappeased, and tears Drawn from the very source of life,? and the longings and tears of Lowell are somehow insipid and uncomely and uncharacteristic. At home he seems to have heard this bird's petulant, melancholy call with more composure. The robin and swallow Lowell used frequently in his poetry, but rarely with enthusiasm; the former seemed to him a sober phil istine, the latter, I fancy, a finely sailing bird, unfortunately almost songless. The chickadee, a brave and gentle little fellow loved by Emerson and Thoreau, surely visited Elmwood every day for whole weeks annually, perhaps nested on Lowell's prop erty; yet he failed to mention him in "My Garden Aquaint ance," and found a niche for him in only a line and a half of all his poetry. There he is "the hidden chickadee." Lowell be stowed his affection, it seems, only on such birds as the fiery, darting oriole, and "that devil-may-care, the bobolink," who swooped and poured forth music in the open fields.</page><page sequence="16">Lowell as a Poet of Nature 437 II Something remains to be said about the quality and quantity of Lowell's nature verse, and of its meaning to-day. Lowell had had his training "in the great school of the senses.'' Born in the country, he lived there, roughly speaking, all his life. The wide fields, the green woods of "Sweet Auburn," the meandering Charles, were his daily surroundings, and they bred in him early an interest in the ways of nature together with a deep love of her. A natural gift of expression, and the fluent vocabulary won from the reading of many books, gave him the means of poetic composition. Poetry was in the air?throughout New England, and particularly about Boston, men, women and children were freely opening their hearts ? his own wife was a poetess?"The Band," a crew of youthful poetasters of whom he was one, read and wrote verses with a species of soul-hunger not always affected ? there was every encouragement for Lowell to engage in the gentle art of verse-making. Unconscious insincerity, on which I have dwelt at length, and another defect which I have but hinted at ? Lowell's lack of ar tistic instinct ? kept the work resulting from these several in fluences from taking high rank in literature. Desire to write artistically was not wanting in Lowell. He insists that no man ever lived who put into his verses more conscience, and he un derscores the word ; he may be a bad poet (not that he is), but he is a good versifier, for does he not write with ease, and has he not studied versecraft till he understands it "from beginning to end" ? Like Carlyle, whom he resembled in more ways than one, he finds that his brain "requires a long brooding time ere it can hatch anything" ; he gets an idea, which settles and clari fies, till he needs only tap it and draw it off the lees,?not a bad method if rightly used. But though the id?e-m?re is delightful to him, he has "no pleasure in working it up." It flows easily, because of his natural fluency, but it does not interest him. Lowell knew only the joy of conception; the joy of elaboration was denied him. Like Carlyle, he was liable to "splash down" rather than compose. Rough lines are rare in his work, but dif fuse stanzas are all too abundant. The art of leaving out was strange to him. And if he lacked the power of compressed and</page><page sequence="17">438 The Sewanee Review well-formed composition, he lacked also what might have miti gated the evil consequences?the art of revision. In his early and middle life he was notoriously careless; later, it is true, he gave more attention to his proofs, but so late as 1884 he wrote in a letter, "The great fault I am always taxing myself with is impatience of revision," and two years after, he wrote to Aldrich apropos of his "Credidimus" poem: "Cut out what you please. There are two or three bright spots. If these be left, all will be well." All will be well! As if poetry were random, protracted utterance to be sliced and combined into a harmonious dish! Lowell was only for moments the artist. Just as the great lack in his temperament was that of poise, true sincerity, and largeness, so in his art, the making of poems, he was without the poise, the calm intensity, that shapes the vision into a lasting reality. In inspiration and workmanship alike Lowell was so seriously de ficient that his poems, with one or two exceptions, hardly fall into the second class. In quantity Lowell's nature verse, though it is a large part of his poetry, is really not considerable. In 1840, just after he reached manhood, he published his first volume, A Year's Life, a volume thin in more senses than one. It is full of maudlin forevermores, weary seas, moaning pines, dear violets, portentous moons, desire for the days of childhood, revolt against silken bards, a sense of "loving God's dear power," and blocks of moralizing wedged in here and there to give a more distinct uplift. Though nature is used as theme or background in most of the poems, it is never used with sustained spontaneity. Between 1840 and 1848 Lowell published a fair amount of verse. Subjects so romantically diverse as Brittany, Pro metheus (a popular romantic hero), the Chippewa tribe, Free dom, Columbus, Hunger and Cold, the Pine-tree, the Past, the Future, the Present Crisis, an Indian-Summer Reverie, the Birch-tree, the Dandelion, Longing, France, Lamartine, and Sir Launfal are all celebrated in these years. All three of Lowell's passions ? patriotism, books, nature?are here exem plified. The Rousseauistic ideas of impassioned recollection, of brotherhood, of freedom, of innate goodness are all distinct, and the idea of the golden age of childhood, in a Wordsworthian</page><page sequence="18">Lowell as a Poet of Nature 439 guise, is already dwelt upon frequently. Yet nature receives more attention and genuine feeling in these years than before or after. The pine-tree is no longer the forlorn Ossianic symbol of the early poems. "An Indian-Summer Reverie," even though in the diffuse and turgid style of Thomson, contains many verses in which the emotion is heightened and rings true. The dandelion poem is pretty, and pleasant in tone. The birch-tree verses are the best of a meditative sort that Lowell ever wrote. The two preludes of Sir Launfal, especially the June passage ? both are thoroughly characteristic of New England ? are decid edly memorable. Lowell's nature poetry of the forties is the most significant of his career. In the years of his maturity we find his most individual work, such as the "Fable for Critics," the "Biglow Papers," and the "Commemoration Ode," his greatest achievement. Nature ap pealed less to his poetic bent: "Under the Willows," "Pictures from Appledore," "A Mood,'* "The Fountain of Youth," "The Nightingale in the Study," "The Nest," "Phcebe," "The Maple" are not remarkable in quantity or quality as the output of the second half of a lifetime. Lowell was turning more and more to patriotic and occasional themes. His nature in these years is not the June and bobolinks and buttercups of his middle period, nor the pseudo-mystical nature of his lonely-sea period ; it?or she?is a creature inseparable from science and the mis cellaneous doubts of the nineteenth century. After all, his best nature poetry dates from the ante-bellum years. Ill The salient traits of Lowell's attitude toward nature are not without meaning in a day when the literary treatment of nature is being debased by the encroachments of science and by the ex cesses of sentimental devotion. Writing in middle age, Lowell observes that he is "grateful for anything that renews in me that capacity for mere delight which made my childhood the richest part of my life. It seems to me as if I had never seen nature again since those days." Throughout his life he looked back, in the manner of Words worth, on the sunny days of his childhood, when nature was</page><page sequence="19">440 The Sewanee Review frank and open and joyous. Even before he was of age he wrote "To Perdita, Singing":? Oh, sing them back, as fresh as ever, .... The sunshine and the merriment. Later, the sight of the dandelion recalled the robin's song of his earliest years, an angel voice? Fresh every day to my untainted ears. The children are "the only rich"; they enjoy "wisely vacant days"?which suggests Wordsworth's "wise passiveness." In one of his latest poems, "The Oracle of the Goldfishes," he peers wistfully into his boyhood, when he? .... by no problem-debts distrest, Sate at life's board, a welcome guest. O golden age, not yet dethroned ! What made me happy, that I owned. In several poems he declared that nature had not lost the glamor of his early years, while in his letters he spoke of the quieting, sustaining influence which, as he grew older, was taking the place of the old unthinking joy. It is clear that the latter assertion is closer to the truth. There were times, no doubt, when for a space he was a boy again ? the bobolinks saw to that ? but in general he was distrest with problem-debts, whatever that may mean. No bird, he says, speaking of the bobolink, "seems to me so thoroughly happy as he, so void of all arri?re pens?e about get ting a livelihood"?"he takes a thoughtless delight in present sunshine." His heart went out, not to the meditative hermit thrush, anchorite of the pine wood, but to the bobolink, joyous reveler over fields of clover. He hated heartily the arri?re pens?e forced upon him by nineteenth-century rationalism, for somehow the theory of evolution ? the fetich of protoplasm, he was tempted to call it ? interfered with his pleasure in the song of birds and the silent shimmer of the moon on the river. Now, June came nearer the mood of childhood than any other month, and helped him to momentary forgetfulness of problem debts; so June became Lowell's month. The fulness of early</page><page sequence="20">Lowell as a Poet of Nature 441 summer gratified him beyond anything else; "filled up," "run o'er," "brimmed o'er" are regular verbs with him, "heaven's cup" he drank in supernaculum fashion. He preferred, not the gloom of the evening, or the mystery of night, or the chill, creeping fogs of early spring, but light and vivacity?clear blue ness and greenness, and free action, buoyancy, enthusiasm. Sometimes a mood, not so much of childhood, rather of the ecstatic poet, seemed to come upon him. We find in Lowell, here and there, expressions of the modern desire to melt into nature, to confuse body and soul and the outer world in spiritual union. More than once he lay on the warm earth under the willow,? .... gathering virtue in at every pore Till it possessed me wholly, and thought ceased, Or was transfused in something to which thought Is coarse and dull of sense. Myself was lost, Gone from me like an ache, and what remained Became a part of the universal joy. My soul went forth, and, mingling with the tree, Danced in the leaves. But these abandonments are rare in Lowell, and never have a quite genuine ring. They suggest the nightly visions of his youth, and seem reflections from those days, or from his read ing, rather than genuine experiences. Lowell's love of nature was at its best Chaucer's pleasure heightened to joy; the modern mystical note in it appears to be false. Thoughtlessness ? not immersion, not reverie ? was the mood Lowell sought when he wished to be happy. The strife of thought, the pitiless hurly burly of the intellect, wore him out. Nature brought repose, made life sufferable, and at times invited the thoughtless joy of youth. To sit on a fence and bask in the sun in the latter days of May was, he says, what he was born for ? not precisely to stand as the great humanist of our renaissance! A dreamer, a lover of secret pangs, of cloistered reverie, Lowell was not and never really tended to be. Sentimentalism of the enthusiastic sort he tried to shun?and shunned with it, unfortunately, much genuine and legitimate enthusiasm. Senti mentalism of the dreamy sort he wisely shunned throughout his mature years. He was not by nature a pale-eyed dreamer, per</page><page sequence="21">442 The Sewanee Review fumed of person and style, but a particularly healthy and witty Yankee, essentially full of enthusiasms and affections, fond of orioles, Nortons, and Calderons. He depended more than was wise, he feared, on the love of his friends ? certainly he did not seclude himself in his library or in an amorphous pine-grove adjoining the Garden of Eden. In his works and in his life, man was never far away. His philosophy was not unlike that of his logger in the Maine woods: "We don't live none too long, any how; and without society a fellow couldn't tell more'n half the time whether he was alive or not." Lowell's poetry, as well as his prose writings and letters ? indeed his whole career?is, among other things, a protest against the modern exclusive love of nature. When the literary treat ment of nature tends to become on the one hand didactic and scientific in its accuracy, and on the other hand dreamy and at tenuated in its affected emotion about the union of the soul of man with the soul of nature, it is time that we turn back to a poet who dared to say, in the words of Fitz Adam, that he loved nature "where she most grandeur shows,?in man," and this despite his fondness for the fields and woods. That Lowell was not one of the great poets is beside the question ; that, his in veterate boyishness notwithstanding, he had a bookish conscious ness and a disturbing intellectual distrust, without the poise and balance of a great spirit?of a Goethe?does not change the meaning of his example. The literary artist should not neglect man in favor of science, or of dreamy personal emotionalism. The true Shekinah is indeed man, civilized man. Perhaps life in the woods is good ; but our civilization, even when it threatens to lurch back to an ignoble savageness, has virtues and graces not easily negligible. To-day more than ever, in the hour of ship wreck, we know how sweet the land is ? how priceless are the humane traits that have hitherto rendered civilization possible. Clearly, the hope of the future is not in the woods ; it is within man. Norman Foerster. The University of North Carolina.</page></plain_text>
