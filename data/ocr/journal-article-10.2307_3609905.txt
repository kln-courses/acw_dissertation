<plain_text><page sequence="1">308 THE MATHEMATICAL GAZETTE fessor of astronomy, has had access to Adams's private papers and has, there- fore, set out the whole story in detail from every angle and with many refer- ences. The computation of a planet position after allowing for the pertur- bations of known planets is complicated enough but the inverse problem of analysing the perturbations so as to discover the position of the unknown planet is of much greater difficulty. Adams gave his solution to the latter problem in his paper, " On the perturbations of Uranus " which is published as No. 8 in the Appendices to Nautical Almanacs 1834-54 while Airy's paper on "Calculations of Perturbations " is No. 6. It is clear from the outset that Adams is indebted to Pontecoulant's Theorie Analytique du Systeme du Monde, Vol. I, p. 486, for his expression of the perturbations of mean longi- tude. Meanwhile, Le Verrier published in June 1846 his second memoir announcing the position of the disturbing planet within 1? of that found by Adams. He appealed to Berlin and on September 23, the same evening, Galle took his place at the telescope and called out what he saw to D'Arrest who followed on the map. Neptune was thus found by Galle within 1? of the place predicted by Le Verrier. Professor Smart describes the ensuing contro- versy about priority in detail. The story makes fascinating reading. One of the main characters, Airy, was undoubtedly a busy man. He was, during this period, called on to attend meetings of the railway gauge committees, to report on the engines of H.M.S. Janus, to inspect a new sawmill at Chatham, and to attend meetings of the Tidal Harbour Commission, etc. Challis was unlucky in that he made over 3000 observations without recognising three observations of the new planet. His defect was that he could have started in September 1845 instead of July 1846. Lalande also observed it in 1795, not only on the 10th May but also on the 8th May, and Lamont on October 25, 1845, and September 11 and 17, 1846. Galle, like Adams, was the eldest of seven children, and, although he lived to be 98 years of age, received no special award from a British Society. On pages 50-1 Smart answers Pierce's criticism that the discovery of Neptune was a happy accident.* An account of the early life of Adams is also given. He is in some ways a model for our schools. He started with the inner urge for a noble science on the practical side and his mathematical training was built up around this practice. He was nurtured in the pure air of the country in the midst of hard work and simple religious piety. He calculated eclipses at the age of sixteen and saw Halley's comet in 1835, and he became Senior Wrangler with 4000 marks while the proxime accessit had only 2000 marks. This volume is worth a place in every school library and everywhere where applications of mathematics are considered. The Royal Astronomical Society is to be congratulated on its new venture. A similar volume could include the talks given to the Forces during the war. The whole is abundant evidence that " the mighty breath which hath invoked my lay " can also descend upon the mathematician and even the technician as well as on the artist, musician, philosopher and poet. A. B. Nicolaus Copernicus, de Revolutionibus, Preface and Book I. Translated by J. F. DOBSON with the assistance of S. BRODETSKY. Pp. 32. 3s. 6d. 1947. (Royal Astronomical Society) The year 1543, in which appeared the epoch-making work of Copernicus, The Torinensian, may be regarded as marking the transition from mediaeval to modern science and the De Revolutionibus bears, therefore, a message of special significance to all who are concerned with the history of scientific thought. * Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Vol. I (1846-8).</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 309 While the book is remarkable in many ways for its modern outlook and approach, it remains overlaid with much that is characteristically archaic, anthropomorphic and even sentimental. Metaphors such as the following are not uncommon. " In the middle of all sits Sun enthroned. In this most beautiful temple could we place this luminary in any better position... ?" Yet there is one celebrated passage in which the idea of universal gravitation " seems to have hovered before the mind of this great man ", and there are many in which strong emphasis is laid upon the essentially relative character of the celestial motions. Thus he argues, "And why not grant that the diurnal rotation is only apparent in the Heavens but real in the Earth? It is but as the saying of Aeneas in Virgil-' We sail forth from the harbour, and lands and cities retire.' As the ship floats along in the calm, all external things seem to have the motion that is really that of the ship, while those within the ship feel that they and all its contents are at rest ". He explains that " Circular motion ... may be combined with the rectilinear-just as a creature may be at once animal and horse ". Copernicus sets out to refute the traditional arguments against the helio- centric theory and we find in one place the prescient suggestion: " Let us then leave to the Physicists the question whether the Universe be finite or no, holding only to this that Earth is finite and spherical." The writing throughout breathes a spirit of humility, reverence and awe. In the preface addressed to Pope Paul III he explains his reluctance to have the volume published on account of the " novelty and incongruity " of his theory; having " kept it in store not for nine years only, but to a fourth period of nine years " he finally yielded to the persuasion of his friends. Printed originally as Occasional Notes of the Royal Astronomical Society, the pamphlet under review is an example of fine and graceful scholarship. The brief extracts quoted above will serve to convey the quality of the trans- lation from the Latin; a valuable feature is the annotation which is very full and informative. The excellence of the printing, reproductions and illus- trations is outstanding in these days of austerity and the booklet is in every respect up to the high standard of the Society's publications. T. A. BROWT. Surveying instruments, their history and class-room use. By E. R. KEILY. Pp. 411. N.p. 1947. Nineteenth Yearbook of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. (525 West 120th Street, New York, 27) "Measurement ", says an Irish poet and writer ", is only a matter of men's prying into the secrets of nature ", and he implies that it is symbolic of " the fall from heaven to earth, which is half the fall of Lucifer ". Brother Edmond R. Kiely, of the Christian Brothers of Ireland, however, invites us to reflect or the romance of measurement. He has had experience in high school and junior engineering mathematics, and from this background he presents a wealth of historical material, which, hitherto, has not been readily available. He then proceeds to adapt the elementary portions to actual mathematical class-room use. If we could only write the history of science with the same accuracy as the orbit of Neptune, then indeed we should have a science of history. The risings and settings of Venus can be calculated backwards to show us when Amnizaduga lived but the science of history does not rest on such a sure foundation. Much of the story of early invention and development of mechan- isms and processes in surveying is necessarily lost beyond recall. Petzval, for instance, produced his prescriptions but his calculations will always be wrapped up in mystery. Nevertheless, this work is an attractive attempt to compress into 237 pages the history of surveying instruments throughout about thirty-two centuries. The Romance of Measurement is here portrayed</page></plain_text>
