(Studies in Mediterranean Archaeology and Literature, 130.) Pp. iv + 186. 49 ills. Jonsered: Paul Astrom, 1995. Paper, Swed. kr. 250. ISBN: 91-7081-085-0. This is the 130th in Paul Astrom's series of publications on Mediterranean subjects and, like many others in the series, it started life as a doctoral dissertation. The area of the study is the Risano valley, in the Istrian peninsula in Slovenia, at the head of the Adriatic Sea. The text is in Italian, with a short summary in English. It covers the protohistoric and Roman periods, with a chronological range of c. 1800 B.C.-A.D. 500. This publication is based on a combination of archaeological field survey, synthesis of earlier archaeological research, and assessment of the ancient written sources. The fieldwork combined intensive fieldwalking of known sites and less intensive survey of areas without known sites, but it is very inadequately described: there is, for instance, no precise description or plan of the areas surveyed. I was concerned to read that the survey employed the 'British method'. By this the author apparently means that they walked the fields in straight lines ten metres apart-a minimal level of recognition for the long tradition of British archaeological field survey! The central and most useful part of the book is the catalogue of sites: eleven protohistoric, all fortified settlements of the type known as castellieri, and forty-three Roman, including towns, working villas situated along the river, and luxury villas on the coast. Maps showing locations are provided for many of these sites, but precise positions are not given for the sites without maps. The rest of the book contains short chapters discussing respectively the archaeological material, toponyms, family and personal names on inscriptions, cults and priests, aspects of the agrarian economy, and harbours and roads. It ends with a chapter summarizing the main conclusions. It describes the gradual Romanization of an area previously occupied by populations based in the castellieri. Romanization was intensified after the foundation in 52 B.C. of the municipium of Aegida (which the author believes was situated at the foot of Sermino). In the first century A.D., settlement in towns such as Capodistria and Sermino was complemented by working villas with residential quarters along the Risano River, while luxurious villas for the Roman elite were built along the coast. At this time viticulture became an important part of the economy and wine was the most important export from the area-a pattern which lasted throughout the Roman occupation to the fifth century A.D. and beyond. Although the book is generally produced to a reasonable standard, the quality of the illustrations is rather poor and they are organized in a frustrating way, using a single series of numbers, but placing the maps and site plans within the text, the finds illustrations at the back of the book. It has to be said that this is one of the lesser offerings in Astrom's valuable series. It is a regionally and chronologically restricted study, without methodological or theoretical innovations to give it wider relevance. It will be useful for scholars working in the study area or adjacent regions, but is unlikely to achieve wider readership. University College London RUTH D. WHITEHOUSE M. DE'SPAGNOLIS CONTICELLO: n Pons Sarni di Scafati e la Via Nuceria-Pompeios. (Ministero per i beni culturali e ambientali. Soprintendza Archeologica di Pompei Monografie, 8.) Pp. 112, 71 plates, 4 maps. Rome: 'L'Erma' di Bretschneider, 1994. ISBN: 88-7062-878-7. This monograph presents the results of a general exploration, including excavations, of a region to the east of Pompeii, in the territory of modern Scafati. S.C. gives a detailed summary of previous studies and describes the buildings, tombs, and other archaeological remains discovered along the line of the ancient road running between Pompeii and Nuceria. The book is well produced, with copious maps, figures, and photographs and colour plates of the frescos of a villa rustica at Scafati. However, it would be easier to make use of this material if it were divided into relevant sections, or at least provided with an index. ?

She provides evidence to support the theory that the consular road between Puteoli and Nuceria ran through the plain to the south of Pompeii rather than through the town itself. She then offers her own theory that this road continued straight to Nuceria, crossing the Sarno at Scafati, rather than turning south to Stabiae: in other words, that her newly charted road is in fact the main Puteoli-Nuceria highway. It certainly continued in use after the eruption of A.D. 79, showing its importance as a route, and an inscription found at Scafati may suggest that the road and its bridge were repaired as a matter of urgency after the earthquake of 62. There is, moreover, no trace of another road coming up the river from Stabiae. The book concentrates on this narrow question, but it contains material with wider implications. Any new information on the hinterland of Pompeii is welcome, especially further evidence that some areas were occupied after the eruption. Above all, the study raises interesting questions about the relationship between Pompeii and Nuceria. S.C. notes, on the basis of different patterns of centuriation, that the Sarno marked the boundary between them, but there remains the question of which town had control over the bridge at Scafati. A cippus found there records the repair of the via Pontis et substructiones by two aediles, M. Antonius [...] and C. Cornelius Fuscus. Both the Antonii and the Cornelii are attested at Pompeii, and S.C. identifies the first man with M. Antonius Tertius, aedile in 62: the bridge was therefore clearly under Pompeian control, and must have been repaired almost immediately after the earthquake. This seems a little tenuous: we have no idea whether these families were not also to be found at Nuceria, and the milestone adjacent to the cippus does mark the distance from that town rather than from Pompeii. More significant for studies of relations between the two towns is the fact that, whatever their allegiance, the magistrates did not feel it necessary to record it on the inscription, although the bridge must have been an important point of interaction between the territories.

Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 1996. $42.50. ISBN: 0-472-10571-X. This monograph gives a complete account of the architectural decoration of the Regia in the sixth century B.C., expanding D.'s account in E. Rystedt, C. Wikander, O. Wikander (edd.), Deliciae Fictiles (Stockholm, 1993) (rev. JRS 85 [1996], 285-6), a fundamental collection of articles on this craft. Hellenistic terracottas from the area are not included, since they belong to a separate building. This leaves the third and fourth phases of the Regia (c. 570 B.C. and the third quarter of the sixth century respectively). D.'s detailed and careful research allows her to distinguish a series of female head antefixes and a strigilated sima with panther's head spout (i.e. a covering for the eaves, which also acted as a gutter on the long sides of temples, to keep water away from the elaborate decoration at the top of the walls) as the sole remaining part of the fourth phase. Even this small amount of evidence can tell us that by this time the Regia stands clearly in the larger pattern of Central Italic architectural decoration, with standardized moulds and centres of production. The earlier third phase is more experimental. Various aspects can be related to other buildings at the Forum Boarium complex, or in Murlo and Acquarossa, but the frieze plaques which show felines, a bird, and a 'Minotaur' are uniquely Roman-these are assigned to a raking cornice and architrave in a pediment on the south side. D. also tentatively hypothesizes a ridge-pole with an anthropomorphic statue and vegetal acroteria, using Murlo and Acquarossa as guides. Quite how this rather axial roof system fits onto the non-axial ground plan of this complex and difficult building is not at all clear; a reconstruction drawing of elevations, however tentative, would have been useful in visualizing how the system would have worked. The presentation is clear; the two phases are taken separately, discussed type by type, with a general conclusion to each, followed by a catalogue and good plans and illustrations. There is a highly useful glossary of terms. One of D.'s great virtues is her careful and cautious explanation ? Oxford University Press, 1997</page></plain_text>
