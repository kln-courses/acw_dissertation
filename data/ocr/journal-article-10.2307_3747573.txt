<plain_text><page sequence="1">NATURE'S EDUCATION OF MAN SOME REMARKS ON THE PHILOSOPHY OF WORDSWORTH C. CLARKE. THE essence of Wordsworth's creed appears, at first glance, to be simple and unambiguous: if we train the eye and ear to become receptive to the influence of natural pbjects, we come in time to receive "authentic tidings of invisible things," intuitive knowledge of a Spirit which informs both Nature and the mind of man. This Spirit is a source of spiritual power; communion with it brings serenity and joy. But for all the apparent simplicity of this creed, we are soon forced to ask difficult questions about it. For example, how, precisely, are we to conceive of this universal Spirit? It is "a motion and a spirit" which informs all things; but what else is it? If it can elevate the thoughts of man, is it itself possessed of moral attributes? Is it, for instance, a Spirit of Love? In order to under- stand more precisely how Wordsworth believed the Spirit, par- ticularly as it manifested itself in the works of Nature, could influence and shape the mind of man, it will be necessary to turn chiefly to The Prelude and, by reference to it, to endeavour to answer the following questions: (I) What, besides motion and infinitude, did Wordsworth consider the properties of the Universal Spirit to be ? (2) How did he believe man acquires knowledge of it? And (3) In what precise sense did he maintain that Nature can educate man morally? All quotations from The Prelude, unless otherwise stated, will be drawn from the I805-6 version of the poem. The conclusions arrived at in this essay are not substantially affected by the changes in Wordsworth's philosophy which began to manifest themselves after this date. In one or two instances, however, a brief consideration of these changes will be necessary. The first question is the most difficult to answer. Again and again Wordsworth tried to translate his vivid awareness of the actual con- crete presence of the Spirit into language that was equally vivid and concrete. The language in which he describes the Spirit and its work- ings is therefore often highly metaphorical. So it is misleading at 302</page><page sequence="2">NATURE'S EDUCATION OF MAN times to take his statements quite at their face value. All statements about a universal Spirit (or any spirit) must be metaphorical; but there are degrees of anthropomorphism in metaphor and sometimes Wordsworth uses metaphors of a more animistic character than at others. It will be necessary to bear in mind this difference in kinds, or levels, of metaphor if we are to determine what are the essential attributes of the Spirit. Wordsworth himself complained that some failed to do this when reading his Ode, Intimations of Immortality. In the Fenwick note to the Ode Wordsworth denies that he meant to inculcate a belief in the pre-existence of souls: "I took hold of the notion of pre-existence as having sufficient foundation in humanity for authorizing me to make for my purpose the best use of it I could as a poet," namely, to express the vividness, dream-like splendour and visionary qualities of the child's sensations. In the same way, Wordsworth sometimes makes relatively direct statements about the Universal Spirit while at other times he is content to shadow forth its nature in terms of animistic metaphor. The first property which Wordsworth quite unambiguously attributes to the whole universe is life: ... in all things now I saw one life and felt that it was joy.' There is not only universal motion, but there is universal life. Furthermore, the Spirit is eternal; it is the one in the many. In "the press of self-destroying, transitory things" it abides, The Soul of Beauty and enduring life .. .2 From this point we begin to tread more doubtful ground. For instance, Wordsworth frequently refers to the "liberty" and the "power" of things. Frequently, of course,he speaks of the spiritualpower which comes to the lover of Nature. But it is clear that he considers the concept of power to have a much wider connotation than this. Power is not merely an idea, or a spiritual condition, the effect of the impact of Nature on the human mind; "ever-during power"3 is itself a property of the universal spir:t. It is the positive, active quality of things by which they influence and dominate other things. It is energy conceived of poetically. Of the positive influence of books, he writes that he will . . . speak of them as Powers For ever to be hallowed; only less, For what we may become, and what we need, Than Nature's self, which is the breath of God.4 The mind may be influenced, in a particularly imperative way, by the power of mountains. Mountains are to Wordsworth obvious I The Prelude, II, 429-30. 2 Ibid., VII, 736. 3 The Excursion, IV, II43. 4 The Prelude, V, 219-22. 303</page><page sequence="3">PHILOSOPHY and striking manifestations of power; they envelop and hang over the habitations of men as a brooding presence. For the human mind is as responsive to emanations of power as all other things in the universe. Indeed much more so. The mind is certainly no exception to the universal law that each thing "feels" emissions of power from the other things which surround it. The mountain's presence ... shapes The measure and the prospect of the soul To majesty .... The concept of power is intimately related to the concept of liberty. For example, the imagination of man, his power to "half create"2 sensations, only develops when he is free from enslavement to the despotic bodily eye and the other senses. During childhood and youth the mind is held "in absolute dominion"3 by the senses. But as the power of imagination develops, it frees the mind and makes both the senses, and the objects with which the senses deal, . . . subservient in their turn To the great ends of Iiberty and Power.4 Both the concepts "liberty" and "power" are embraced within the even more important concept of "imagination." Imagination is at once the liberty and the power of things. In the final book he says of imagination that it "alone is genuine liberty."5 Imagination is a property of the universe as a whole. It is the creative principle in all things, the power which creates a unity out of a given multi- plicity. Wordsworth conceived of all things as, in varying degrees, creative. Perception is regarded, not as a purely human activity, but as a process which has its equivalents throughout the whole of Nature. In the lines prefaced to The Excursion he announces that in the proposed philosophical poem The Recluse his theme will be how exquisitely the human mind and the external world are fitted to each other; he will write of . . . the creation (by no lower name Can it be called) which they with blended might Accomplish.... This power to create is the greatest virtue that a thing can possess.6 In the celebrated passages on imagination in the final book, Words- worth makes it quite clear that imagination in Nature is identical in kind with the imagination which is present in man,2 and pre- eminently so in higher minds. Moreover, the relationship of "mutual x The Prelude, VII, 723-5. 2 Lines composed above Tintern Abbey, I, io6. 3 The Prelude, XI, 176. 4 Ibid., XI, I83-4. 5 Ibid., XIII, 122. 6 Ibid., XII, 378-9. 7 Ibid., XIII, 84-92. 304</page><page sequence="4">NATURE'S EDUCATION OF MAN domination"I or "interchangeable supremacy"' which exists between all things is not an external one. There is an interpenetration of all things in the universe, an interfusion of all the parts in an organic whole. He records a moment of supreme intuition when he felt all things Were half confounded in each other's blaze, One galaxy of life and joy.2 Nothing exists independently, for everything is informed by the one Spirit. It is because the Spirit is the Spirit of God that its operations are so highly integrated, "like the workings of one mind."3 In the introduction to his edition of The Prelude, de Selincourt writes: "In the highest mood of ecstasy, (Wordsworth's) consciousness of com- plete oneness with God is so overwhelming, that his other attributes as man seem to fall from him, and he knows only that one interior life In which all beings live with God, themselves Are God.... " and in the note to lines 220-4, Book II, he writes, that an essential feature of this mystical experience is "the sense that God in Nature is one with God in the soul, so that the soul seems to be God or be Nature." The lines quoted immediately above appear in a notebook, but not in any completed poem of Wordsworth's. They do justice to the immanence of God in the universe, but not to his transcendence of it. Wordsworth appears to have conceived of God as a Being who both transcended the universe and also breathed a Spirit of life and creativeness into it, and particularly into the mind of man. The Spirit is "Nature's self, which is the breath of God."4 In a later book the metaphor from breathing is repeated. . . Great God! Who send'st thyself into this breathing world Through Nature and through every kind of life, And mak'st man what he is, Creature divine. .. .5 God sends himself into the breathing world; that is, he sends his breath into the world. Nature and man are divine because they are inspired (in the etymological sense of the word) by this divine breath. Indeed, they are God's breath, because the breath is their essence. Wordsworth was, of course, emphatically opposed to the idea that Nature and man stand over against God as things which he has made, as a watchmaker makes a watch. But because he repudiated this view he was not therefore committed to pantheism. De Selincourt I See The Prelude, I850 version, XIV, 8i-4. 2 Ibid., VIII, 629-30. 3 Ibid., VI, 568. 4 Ibid., V, 222. 5 Ibid., X, 386-9. U 305</page><page sequence="5">PHILOSOPH Y points out how several lines are altered by Wordsworth, in the I850 version, "to cover up the traces of his early pantheism." For example, the line God and nature's single sovereignty' becomes Presences of God's mysterious power Made manifest in Nature's sovereignty. But it is not clear that the line quoted here from the I805 version is a completely accurate expression of Wordsworth's faith at that time. It needs to be balanced, or augmented, by other lines from the I805 Prelude, such as those already quoted (X, 386-9), which do more justice to the transcendence of God. "All beings live with God, them- selves are God" because God is the soul of Nature. Without him it would be as a carcase. Nature is therefore different, and yet not different, from God. It is allowable to speak of "God and nature's single sovereignty." And yet this is only a partial expression of the truth, for God also transcends Nature. It may be safely asserted, then, that Wordsworth attributed to the universal Spirit the properties of movement, infinity, life, eternal endurance, power and liberty (or imagination), and unity. And, finally, he felt the Spirit to be divine. When he speaks of the power or the liberty of things, he means such metaphors to be taken seri- ously. What it means to take a Wordsworthian metaphor seriously may be illustrated from the following passage: For me, when my affections first were led From kindred, friends, and playmates, to partake Love for the human creature's absolute self, That noticeable kindliness of heart Sprang out of fountains.; Wordsworth is not merely saying here that fountains spring up spontaneously and give themselves freely as though they were kind, and that he drew a lesson from this appearance of kindliness and applied it in the field of human action. The metaphor is no such tame and commonplace thing. The language is direct, unequivocal and compelling. It demands to be taken seriously. Wordsworth is saying that his own kindliness of heart sprang out of fountains. The fountains are themselves kindly, and the kindliness of fountains and the kindliness of the human heart is one thing. He is expressing his intuitive awareness of the upsurging, creative and loving spirit that is in all things. But though we take this metaphor seriously we are not required, as a consequence, to take all the "human" meaning associated with I The Prelude, IX, 237. 2 Ibid., I850 version, VIII, I2I-5. 306</page><page sequence="6">NATURE'S EDUCATION OF MAN the phrase "kindliness of heart" and apply it in the case of fountains. A kindly heart is kindly disposed towards someone, and the "love" in the lines quoted above is directed towards "the human creature's absolute self." Is the kindliness of the fountains also directed towards something? Is the universal Spirit a loving Spirit in a fully anthro- pomorphic sense? In the early books of The Prelude there is no men- tion of universal love, but only of the mother's love. We learn that the universal Spirit is a joyously assertive Spirit; it is glad, spon- taneous, creative and powerful. Joy, and not love, is the characteristic word. But towards the end of the poem the emphasis alters; we find Wordsworth writing of the "pervading love"' in all creatures, of love in Nature and of the "tender ways"' of the lamb and the lamb's mother. But what is this "pervading love" directed towards? The difficulty here is that the verb "love" is transitive. When Wordsworth writes of the unutterable love on the face of the clouds,2 he is not speaking, in an orthodox way, of a God who loves humanity, but rather of a God who loves-what? presumably to create and to con- template his creation. The highest sort of love, the pure spiritual love of God, is inseparably linked with creation. It neither acts "nor can exist without Imagination."3 Here we recognize the familiar theo- logical notion that God creates because he loves. But what He loves is-creating. We hear echoes here of Spinoza's Intellectual Love of God, which is that reflexive love of God whereby God loves himself. The fountain's loving and joyous flow is God loving himself, and the love of the clouds is not directed towards man. It is more difficult to determine the meaning of some of the basic Wordsworthian metaphors than of others. The metaphors of love and joy are particularly difficult. In what sense can joy be considered a property of the universal Spirit? How are we to understand the line: I saw one life and felt that it was joy4 . . . ? or how interpret the statement that "every flower enjoys the air it breathes"? Though the metaphor here is a highly anthropomorphic one, it does not follow that there is not some real sense in which it has a universal applicability. The human experience of enjoyment may have its equivalents in the natural world. One is reminded of the use of the word "enjoyment" in the metaphysics of Samuel Alexander. Indeed, in endeavouring to shadow forth the nature of the uni- versal Spirit, Wordsworth fell very easily and very frequently into the language of animism. De Selincourt writes (in the note to lines 351-72, Book I): "It is interesting to notice that when Words- I The Prelude, XIII, I49-56. X The Excursion, I, 203-5. 3 The Prelude, 1850 version, XIV, I88-9. 4 Ibid., II, 430. 307</page><page sequence="7">PHILOSOPHY worth began to write The Prelude he still delighted to conceive of Nature not merely as the expression of one divine spirit, but as in its several parts animated by individual spirits who had, like human beings, an independent life and power of action. This was obviously his firm belief in the primitive paganism of his boyhood and long after he had given up definite belief in it he cherished it as a more than poetic fancy." In the book on childhood there are two obvious examples of this primitivism. There are the lines in which he describes how he stole trapped woodcocks and heard Low breathings conling after me, and sounds Of undistinguishable motion, steps Almost as silent as the turf they trod.I And there is the episode of the stolen boat.z But such language is not confined to the first book. In the later books which tell of the experi- ences of youth and manhood traces of the early paganism are still visible. When he is describing his experience in the Simplon Pass, he tells how waterfalls, rocks and winds all seemed to him "like work- ings of one mind." Yet in this very passage where he is recording an intuition of the unity of the Spirit, he drops for two or three lines into language which bears the unmistakable marks of a more primitive belief: The rocks that mutter'd close upon our ears, Black drizzling crags that spake by the way-side As if a voice were in them . . .3 We are reminded here of the Fenwick note on the Ode, Intimations, which has been already quoted. The notion that rocks mutter, like the notion of pre-existence, has sufficient foundation in humanity for authorizing Wordsworth to make for his purpose the best use he can of it as a poet. The result is a sort of animism, but again it cannot be negligently dismissed as "mere" animism. The basic ideas of the life, mutual domination and interpenetration of all things are here being expressed in terms of a very appropriate myth. All the separate ideas of universal life, power and so on are compositely and con- cretely felt when we read of crags that speak by the wayside. The intimate interpenetration of things is suggested by "the rocks that mutter'd close upon our ears." The low breathings that came after the poet as a child were not, it is true, the breathings of an individual spirit, but nor were they entirely unreal. They were a manifestation of the intimate domination of the mind by Nature. The basic Wordsworthian metaphors, such as power and liberty, are drawn from the sphere of human mental activity and invested with a less restricted and grander significance. In the new universe of discourse they shed many of their distinctively human associations. I The Prelude, I, 330-2. 2 Ibid., I, 409-12. 3 Ibid., VI, 562-4. 308</page><page sequence="8">NATURE'S EDUCATION OF MAN We have been trying to distinguish these metaphors from those such as "love," which retain many of their human associations even in their new setting-and are intended to do so. Any endeavour to determine what properties may actually be ascribed to the universal Spirit soon resolves itself into an attempt to distinguish these two sorts of metaphor, or, more often, into an attempt (with the example of such a metaphor as pre-existence in mind) to determine how much of a given metaphor is to be interpreted "unmetaphorically," and how much is to be regarded as a poetic device for suggesting vividly the nature of the basic reality. Power and liberty may be regarded as typical instances of real attributes of the Spirit; and "kindliness of heart" and "love," in the transitive, human sense, as instances of anthropomorphic attributes, though it is necessary to remember that there is a sense in which all the attributes may be considered anthropomorphic, and that the one class shades into the other. The "joyfulness" of the sea is a metaphor which falls somewhere between the two classes. So, in the context of Wordsworth's poetry, the archaic animism implicit in some of the dead metaphors of everyday language acquires an unexpected and startling significance. When he writes of the grandeur or solemnity of the hills, he is expressing "a more than poetic fancy." II The Prelude is the record of the "Growth of a Poet's Mind." One aspect of that growth is the evolution of the poet's conception of the universal Spirit. In boyhood he conceives of it animistically; as he matures this conception is gradually refined. This evolution corresponds with a development in the actual process of knowing. Wordsworth believed that there are two ways of knowing-by asso- ciation of ideas, and by intuition. The theory of the association of ideas was peculiarly attractive to him, and there appears to have been a period in his life, corresponding perhaps with the period in which he was most under the influence of Godwinian intellectualism, when he believed that the theory explained completely how the human mind acquires knowledge. His kinship with Hartley and English sensationalism has been thoroughly established by Professor Beatty in his study William Wordsworth: His Mind and Art. Words- worth was greatly attracted by the theory that sensations are the very stuff out of which the moral life is built; indeed this was in large measure his own faith. Hartley had methodically traced such a con- nection between sensations and character, and had endeavoured to show that the whole fabric of man's intellectual and moral life is built up by one single process, the association, into increasingly com- 309</page><page sequence="9">PHILOSOPHY plex systems, of simple ideas, or sensations. But this theory could not for long hold Wordsworth's complete allegiance, for it could not explain, and it allowed no place to, those direct intuitions of reality which visited him more and more frequently as he approached man- hood. De Selincourt has remarked that for Wordsworth "there was always this great paradox, that though it is simply by the proper exercise of eye and ear that man reaches his full moral and intellectual stature, yet revelation flashes upon him when "the light of sense goes out" and "laid asleep in body," he becomes deeply conscious of the presence of God within him." Wordsworth makes the difference between these two ways of knowing clear in a number of passages. It is important to realize this because there is at least one critic, namely Professor Beatty, who maintains that Wordsworth remained a strict associationist to his last days. But this is not borne out by the evi- dence of his autobiographical poem. Even the tempestuous enjoy- ments of his childhood were illumined occasionally by "gleams like the flashing of a shield,"I rare flashes of intuitive insight which had nothing to do with an association of ideas. In the second book he makes the distinction between the two ways of knowing quite explicit: My seventeenth year was come And, whether... To unorganic natures I transferr'd My own enjoyments, or, the power of truth Coming in revelation, I convers'd With things that really are, I, at this time Saw blessings spread around me like a sea.s The mind of the child arrives at an animistic conception of Nature because its knowledge is, with the exception of occasional "gleams," gained by the association of ideas; insight into the real nature of the universal Spirit mostly comes later and is achieved through intuition. But such intuition is only possible to the mind which has been disci- plined to receive it by "the proper exercise of eye and ear." Indeed it would be wrong to imagine that, because the two ways of knowing are antithetical, there is therefore a fundamental antagonism between them. The object of the one knowing process is different from that of the other. The object of knowledge through association of ideas is Nature, in the sense of the world of natural objects; the object of intuitive insight is Nature in the sense of an ultimate, non-visible Reality. (Wordsworth uses the word in both senses.) The worship of Nature, that is, the world of natural objects, is not an end in itself. It is to be valued because it leads to that higher sort of knowing by which 'we see into the life of things.'3 Such insight, however, only I The Prelude, I, 614. 2 Ibid., II, 405-I4. 3 Lines composed above Tintern Abbey, I, 49. 3I0</page><page sequence="10">NATURE'S EDUCATION OF MAN came to Wordsworth because he had first learned to love Nature. And it is through an association of ideas that such love develops. Sensations from the world of natural beauty are associated in infancy with love for the mother and also, in childhood, with the pleasurable organic sensations which accompany physical activity. The beauty of Nature is at this stage valued only secondarily, because it is asso- ciated with animal pleasures and sports. The association of beauty with pleasure is, however, to be a lifelong possession. In those hours of childhood when "from excess of happiness" the blood appears "to flow with its own pleasure,"I a scene of natural beauty, such as the setting of the sun, has a peculiar power to disturb the boy. For he is receiving sensations of colour and form from Nature at the same time that he is most aware of the exuberant life within him. As a consequence, the "internal" pleasure is transferred to, or comes to be associated with, the object of perception in the world of Nature. So there comes a time when the setting of the sun can act alone as a primary stimulus to pleasure and can set in motion, in mind and body, a complex system of ideas, feelings and sensations. Included in this system are those sensations of joyful organic activity which have so often accompanied his perception of a sunset. So the child comes to have premonitions of the truth that there is a joyful life in the sun as there is a joyful life in his own body. But how can it be proved that this is truth? Does not mere animal vitality cast an illusion over life? Because a healthy boy feels very much alive, are we to believe that all nature is alive with him? Wordsworth was not unaware of this problem. The lines quoted above (whether ... to unorganic natures I transferr'd my own enjoyments) tend to suggest that he regarded "knowledge" gained by the association of ideas as having a doubtful validity, and that there is a sharp distinction between such "knowledge" (or opinion), and knowledge gained by intuition, since the one projects qualities into Nature and the other discovers them there. But this was not, in fact, Wordsworth's belief. He certainly believed that Fancy-par- ticularly the Fancy of the adolescent-could read into Nature much that was not there. But it was also his deep conviction that animistic fancies were, most often, the crude expression of important truths. We have already noticed that he refined the language of animism and made use of it to communicate his own intuitions. In fact, Wordsworth was not seriously troubled by the philosophical doubt that he might have been transferring his own enjoyments into "unorganic natures." He was not, like Coleridge, racked by the thought that we receive but what we give And in our life alone does Nature live. The Prelude, II, I9I-3. 3II</page><page sequence="11">PHILOSOPHY His answer to such a doubt was that he did "transfer his enjoy- ments" as a child but that his later intuitions proved he had not been deceived by Nature in doing this. The wild impulses of the child had proved essentially trustworthy. He believed that the impulses of the child and the intuitions of the man were both reliable. The intuitions proved the impulses to be reliable, and the intuitions were reliable because they were intuitions, and because Nature is good and does not deceive. This is his natural piety, his faith that Nature never did betray The heart that loved her., So we find him writing of Emotion which best foresight need not fear,z Most worthy then of trust when most intense. There is fresh evidence here of the importance to Wordsworth of the basic concepts of Liberty and Imagination. The development of man in moral stature depends on the free, imaginative, assertion of his emotional life, in accordance with Nature and the vital, expansive Spirit in all things. He was very soon, in the Ode to Duty, to repudiate this romantic ethic, and even in the last book of The Prelude itself he voices a doubt about it. The impulsive affirmations of Nature are not, perhaps, always good and trustworthy. It is necessary to keep In wholesome separation the two natures The one that feels, the other that observes.3 In The Prelude as a whole, however, no such reservations are made. Natural impulses are there regarded as completely trustworthy and as the ultimate source of all knowledge. They bring authentic tidings of Reality. III We have examined Wordsworth's beliefs concerning the nature of Reality and the knowing mind, that is, his beliefs concerning the properties of the universal Spirit and how man acquires knowledge of it. We are now in a position to consider the final question, how Nature, informed by this Spirit, can not only supply man with know- ledge, but also contribute to his moral education. There are two questions involved here: first, how can communing with Nature have any moral effect on us at all, and second, how, in particular, can it teach us to love man ? In his notes to his edition of Wordsworth, William Knight pooh- poohed the idea that people who live in beautiful natural surround- I Lines composed above Tintern Abbey, I, I22-3. z The Prelude, XIII, II5-I7. 3 Ibid., 330-I. 312</page><page sequence="12">NATURE'S EDUCATION OF MAN ings are any more moral than people who do not. But Wordsworth did not claim that education against a background of Nature was the only way of developing morally. In Book VII on his Residence in London, he writes of the bewildering multiplicity of sights in the city. It is difficult for the human mind to grasp and master such diversity. But it is not bewildering to all minds: It is not wholly so to him who looks In steadiness, who hath among least things An under-sense of greatest; sees the parts As parts, but with a feeling of the whole. This, of all acquisitions first, awaits On sundry and most widely different modes Of education; nor with least delight On that through which I pass'd.I And secondly, it is not natural beauty, unaided, which Words- worth considered a great moral educator. It is natural beauty in alliance with other sources of power-and chiefly books, and the sturdy, simple life of the dalesmen. He is aware that sensitive souls who have been brought up in surroundings of natural beauty are liable to develop a deep appreciation of poetry. But he is also aware that reading poetry will make them more able to appreciate natural beauty: Visionary Power Attends upon the motions of the winds Embodied in the mystery of words.2 It is the association of natural beauty with human virtue which he considered so valuable an educational force. This is particularly clear in the passage on admiration and love from the notebook Y which de Selincourt has published, and in the passage in Book II on the mental development of the baby. The baby sees love in the mother's eye and holds "mute dialogues" with her heart. Because it is loved it learns to love in return, and by association learns to love, in addition, all the sensations in the mother's environment. Thus from birth love and sensation, virtue and beauty, are indissolubly connected. Indeed, love acts as an actual synthesizing principle in perception. Of the baby and the mother's love for it, he writes: Such feelings pass into his torpid life Like an awakening breeze, and hence his mind Even in the first trial of its powers Is prompt and watchful, eager to combine In one appearance, all the elements And parts of the same object, else detach'd And loth to coalesce. Thus, day by day, Subjected to the discipline of love, The Prelude, VII, 709-I5. 2 Ibid., V, 619-2I. 313</page><page sequence="13">PHILOSOPHY His organs and recipient faculties Are quicken'd, are more vigorous, his mind spreads, Tenacious of the forms which it receives., and again, of the mother: From this beloved Presence, there exists A virtue which irradiates and exalts All objects through all intercourse of sense.2 That is why perception is described, on more than one occasion, as a process of creation as well as of receiving.3 A human being loves sensations from birth; he seizes them; he goes half-way to meet them; he orders and synthesizes them. And when the source of love is removed (as in Wordsworth's case by the death of both parents) the association of love and beauty remains, because it has become an established habit. The next step is the widening of this association to include others beyond the circle of family and playfellows. Man is first seen against the background of Nature in the persons of the simple, virtuous shepherd class. So again an important association is formed. Love of Nature leads gradually to love of the noble men associated with Nature. But along with this moral development in accordance with the principle of association, and tending to supersede it, there goes a different sort of education which has affinities with the second way of knowing, namely the intuitive. And here we reach that part of Wordsworth's teaching which is most familiar. He maintained that those whose sensory responses are not deadened by habit but are vitalized by imagination (whose function it is to create and to counteract the tendency of things to mechanically repeat the past), may draw spiritual power from Nature by merely being in her presence. No principle of association is involved to explain how this occurs. Nature stamps her impressions directly on the mind of man and thereby chastens, subdues and strengthens him. But bearing Knight's criticism in mind, it is important to remember that this effect is not automatic simply because it is direct. It operates only on those who predispose themselves to receive it, who break the bonds of habit and sense with a wise passiveness. The compelling immediacy of the imprint is conveyed in the following lines: Oh! then the calm And dead still water lay upon my mind Even with a weight of pleasure, and the sky Never before so beautiful, sank down Into my heart, and held me like a dream.4 The Prelude, II, 244-54. 2 Ibid., 258-60. 3 Lines composed above Tintern Abbey, I, I05-7. 4 The Prelude, II, 176-80. 314</page><page sequence="14">NATURE'S EDUCATION OF MAN The water lies directly on the mind and tranquillizes it. And again: By influence habitual to the mind The mountain's outline and its steady form Gives a pure grandeur, and its presence shapes The measure and the prospect of the soul To majesty.....I The influence here is habitual but, though habitual, it does not operate through the association of ideas. Rather it is by the constant repetition of unnoticed, but direct, impulses. The mountain, directly and immediately, gives its grandeur and shapes the soul. The moun- tain can communicate its power to the human mind in the same way that any natural object can influence or dominate another-in the same way, for instance, that a river flows into and enriches the sea. There is no special problem about the way in which Nature can directly influence the human mind, though the susceptibility of human minds to such influence varies greatly. These direct impulses from natural objects have affinities with the highest type of mystical intuition, and yet they are clearly different. For these experiences are not the occasions when "the light of sense goes out," though they are the forerunners of such occasions. This type of direct moral education through incipiently mystical experiences, is related also to moral education through the associa- tion of ideas, that is, through the association of love and beauty. In fact it is only those objects which the child has learned to love through an association of ideas which are capable later of striking upon his mind with the impact of revelation. The child learns to love the object in a general way and, thus predisposed, he comes to receive direct impulses from Nature which, though often marginal and subtle, have a most powerful moral effect, for they are harbingers of the highest type of intuition.
