One sense refers to the fact that the circumcision ritual of the Merina o1 Madagascar begins with a request for the blessing of God anc the ancestors but ends with a number of acts of violence, bot[ symbolical and real. The other relates to the fact that the ritual was at certain historical periods and under certain circum- stances seen simply as part of the mystical transmission of the moral identity of descent groups through time but at other historical periods became part of the legitimation of the domi- nation of one group of Merina over others and a celebration o1 the conquest of non-Merina by the Merina rulers and theii army. While at first these two senses might appear to be quit( different, the purpose of the book is to show that they are crucially and illuminatingly related. It is argued that the ele- ment of violence that is always found in the symbolism of social reproduction but in this case takes the form of the wounding of the child's genitalia and the requirement thai participants spiritually surrender to the will of the ancestors can, under the right political circumstances, be transformec into a legitimation of expansionism and military aggression. The book therefore seeks to discover the roots of that which makes members of social groups feel that they are always straining at the leash, ready to conquer and consume others symbolically or in fact. It finds these roots in religious illumina- tion of the most profound and self-denying kind. 1 Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1986. Vol. 27 * No. 4 * August-October 1986 The aim of the book, then, is first of all a general theoretical one, but its theoretical propositions are demonstrated by means of a detailed analysis of a particular case: the history of the Merina circumcision ritual and its transformations over a period of approximately 200 years. Two kinds of factual study are combined in this analysis. One could be seen as a typical product of the anthropological academic tradition, the other as a typical product of the histor- ical academic tradition. The anthropological side consists of an analysis of the ritual symbolism. It makes use of a number of techniques recently developed in anthropology which involve not just an analysis of the religious themes as they occur in this particular ritual but also and inevitably an analysis of those themes as they occur in other rituals and other manifestations. As a result, the detailed analysis of this particular ritual can also be seen as a general study of Merina religion. The book also contains a relatively traditional historical study of the Merina circumcision ritual, examining the changes in it over time and the changes in its importance for the Merina and in its place in the overall religious and sociopolitical system. The study covers the period roughly from 1780 to 1970, which saw the virtual creation and extraordinary expansion of the Merina state during the early 19th century, the conversion of the Merina ruler and of many of her subjects to Protestant Chris- tianity, the subsequent defeat of the Merina state at the hands of a French colonial invasion, the growth of a nationalist oppo- sition closely associated with the Protestant churches, indepen- dence from France, and finally the growing antagonism be- tween a bourgeoisie focussed on the capital and the expatriate Malagasy communities in France and, on the other side of the class divide, a poor rural peasantry. The combination of anthropology and history is attempted 349</page><page sequence="2">here because it enables us to seek answers to many fundamen- tal questions which recur in the social sciences but which re- quire a longer time-span than is usually taken into account in anthropological studies. Some of these questions are the fol- lowing: (1) If we assume, with most anthropological theorists of religion, that there is a connection between religious prac- tices and belief, on the one hand, and socioeconomic condi- tions, on the other, how is it that religious phenomena can remain largely unchanged in times of dramatic social change? (2) Why is it that people-women in this case-may be enthu- siastic participants in ritual practices which seem to humiliate them? (3) What type of knowledge is religious knowledge, and how is it related to other types of knowledge? (4) What is the relationship between symbolic violence and military violence? In the remaining part of this article, I shall briefly outline how these questions are approached in the book. 1. When we look at Merina circumcision in history, we are faced with a paradox. If we concentrate on the symbols used, the songs sung, the dances danced, and the overall ritual se- quence, there seems to have been extraordinarily little change. The earliest account found of the Merina circumcision ritual, which refers to a period antedating 1825, could apply with very few modifications to a ritual that I observed in 1971 and that is described and analyzed in great detail in the book by way of an example. Of course, there are certain differences in detail, but these do not seem to modify the overall symbolical structure of the ritual. What was done before 1825 and not done in 1971 is a matter of mere repetitions of symbols or actions that occur in other parts of the ritual and are performed in all recorded versions of the ritual irrespective of their date. However, if we look at the ritual from a functionalist point of view, in terms of its apparent social role, we get a picture of amazingly rapid change. For the earliest period, before 1825, the ritual seems to have been concerned only with ensuring the mystical reproduction of descent groups represented in ritual as permanent and unchanging. Then, after 1825, as the Merina kingdom established itself during the 19th century, royal involvement became a major factor in the transformation of the political and social significance of the ritual. This royal involvement had two aspects. First of all, the circumcision ritual of the boys of the royal family became not just a descent-group ritual for the royal descent group but also probably the largest-scale state ritual of the Merina kingdom, involving much of the vast population of this kingdom and a large part of the army. The incorporation of non-royals in what was at the same time a ritual of the royal family parallels the way the Merina rulers often represented their whole kingdom. In their speeches, kings and queens talked of their subjects as though they formed one vast descent group of which the monarch was a kind of super-elder in mystical contact with his predecessors-who were thus also ambiguously represented as either his ancestors only or the ancestors of the whole Merina nation. Second, the circumcision of commoner boys was also affected by the expansion and bureaucratisation of the Merina state. The performance of the circumcision ritual by subjects became allowable by law only after the royal circumcision ritual, which occurred in the capital at governmentally fixed intervals. As a result, the ritual became an act of allegiance as well as a descent-group ritual. The dates specified by the gov- ernment for the performance of the circumcision ritual also became the occasion for a royal census of the population and for the collection of certain taxes. Even the content of the ritual for subjects was affected by this state interference in that a part of the traditional role of elders was, during the first half of the 19th century, taken by the ruler or his representative and no longer by a member of the descent group. This administrative involvement also led to practical difficulties which themselves brought about further minor changes. Then, towards the middle of the century, for reasons which 350 had much to do with the bizarre personality of the ruler, the royal involvement in the circumcision ritual ended. This, among other things, led to a traditionalist revolt with millena- rian overtones which involved an attempt by the rebels to force the king to carry out the royal circumcision ritual and to restore the "traditional" practices-in fact innovations of the previous half-century. The restoration of the royal circumcision cere- mony was short-lived. Soon after the revolt, the Merina rulers and a large part of the population officially became Christian. This meant that although the ritual was not abandoned, it became a discreet affair and royal involvement was no longer in evidence. The ritual became very small-scale and its coexis- tence with Christianity something of an embarrassment. By and large, this situation did not change after the French conquest in 1896. A new element, however, began to gain significance during the colonial period. Christianity, which had previously been much resented as a foreign intrusion by large sectors of the population, became, for a number of rea- sons, associated with the remarkably advanced and well- organised Malagasy nationalist resistance to the colonial gov- ernment. This resistance movement waxed and waned, but it was already well developed by the time of World War I and reached a peak after the abortive rebellion of 1947. This meant that for the period from about 1870 to 1950 the circumcision ceremony, which was one of the few traditional practices seen by the Merina as unambiguously non-Christian, became a dou- ble embarrassment to many Merina; it was seen as "barbarous" and a leftover of a primitive past and also suggested a kind of betrayal of the nationalist-cum-Christian cause. The post-Independence Malagasy state set up in the early 1960s changed the picture only gradually. The most significant fact was that, after Independence, those who had previously been in the vanguard of nationalist resistance to the French came to be seen, by the rural Merina at least, as a new ex- ploitative bourgeoisie. This altered the attitude to Christianity in the countryside and had a significant effect on the circumci- sion ceremony. Precisely because it had previously been seen as the least Christian and most traditional ritual still performed, it suddenly gained greatly in importance once more, this time as a way of expressing latent anti-elite, and therefore poten- tially anti-Christian, sentiment. This history of the place of the circumcision ritual in the socioeconomic history of the Merina is not difficult to under- stand, but it raises the following question: Why did this func- tional change have so little effect on the symbolical content of the ritual? The answer given in the book is twofold and con- cerns the nature of the ritual itself. First, the ritual is understood as a mystical means whereby the participants transform their being from one which they represent as earthly and sensuously enjoyable to one which is other-worldly, associated with the ancestors, moral, and above all death-vanquishing. The circumcision ritual is a matter of plunging oneself into the transcendental by breaking away from ordinary existence, the validity of which is at the same time symbolically denied. It is argued that the practice is to a certain extent successful and that therefore the world created by the ritual is indeed largely isolated from the vicissitudes of events. More precisely, while the uses of the ritual change, that aspect of the ritual which is other-worldly is largely unaffected by these events. Second, the very nature of ritual communication makes this relative isolation from events of the ritual content possible in that the "argument" is expressed in the non-discursive medium of singing, dancing, and material symbols. This means that the ritual form can be either repeated or abandoned but cannot, in the short term at least, be easily modified. Indeed, the two aspects of the disconnection of the ritual context from history are two sides of the same phenomenon. As the ritual attempts to project the participants beyond this world and therefore CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="3">beyond history, the participants slip into a form of communica- tion in which they appear, both to themselves and to others, not as the subject of the discourse but as its object. Of course, once this point about the stability of the content of the ritual in rapdily changing circumstances has been made, it must also rapidly be modified. Clearly, rituals such as the one in question do change, clearly, they are open to manipula- tion, but they are still much less plastic than other aspects of culture. This fact in itself has general theoretical implications. For example, it might suggest that very long-term cultural con- tinuities might be explained by the stability of this kind of ritual. There remains one problem, however: Why is it that a rela- tively unchanging ritual such as this one can continue to have political relevance in dramatically changing historical circum- stances? The answer is again to be found in the nature of the ritual. The ritual is the replacement of the order of this world by an alternative other-worldly order. Parallel to this replace- ment is a replacement of the value of types of action: thus, this- worldly creativity in the hands of mortals becomes irrelevant, while true creativity, in the world evoked by the ritual, comes only from the other world. However, the ritual also creates a crucial earthly role, that of intermediaries through whom tran- scendental power comes to earth. In most of the circumcision rituals examined, these intermediaries are elders, who are the agents among the living of the other-worldly ancestors. Any person exercising this role is by definition a legitimate power holder, since the source of legitimate power in the world at- tempted by the ritual is the ancestors. This intermediary role explains the paradox of both the specificity of this role and its lack of specificity. The power holder in this world is anyone who can convince others or coerce them into thinking that he has a right to such exercise; in the other world this aspect is irrelevant, and insofar as he represents the ancestors he need not change. This means that people with power can seize the ritual in changing circumstances and through it can be fixed in an apparently unchanging order. This is precisely what hap- pened. For example, when the king began to extend his control into areas which had previously been monopolised by descent- group elders, he took over some aspects of the role of inter- mediary without changing the symbolical part of the ritual to any significant extent. 2. The next question to be considered is one which has al- ways been central to any theory of ideology. If the analysis of a practice such as the ritual discussed in this book can convinc- ingly be shown to legitimate the domination of one group of people by another, we must ask why the dominated group acquiesces in and is moved by that practice. The problem takes a very obvious form in the ritual in question in connection with the role of women. Unlike many other male initiation rituals, the Merina cir- cumcision ceremony gives women a significant role. This role is, however, negative in many ways, since the element they represent is dramatically defeated in the ritual. As we have seen, the circumcision ritual, like other Merina rituals, creates a dualistic image of the person. On the one hand, people are born like animals and retain this animal nature to a certain extent throughout their lives. This is associated by the Merina with wetness, sensuality, and bodily processes, especially the processes of birth and decomposition after death. This side of the person is felt to be feminine, and so it is normal that in the ritual it should be embodied by women and their role. The other side of the person is ancestral. It is created by receiving the blessing of the ancestors throughout one's life and espe- cially at rituals of blessing such as circumcision. As one goes through life, this blessing transforms one inwardly by changing one s substance from wet to dry. There is another way of visu- alising this process. Since what differentiates the living from the dead is that they are wet while the dead in the tomb are, Vol. 27 *No. 4 *August-October 1986 and should be, dry, one becomes gradually more ancestral as one goes through life. Now, although this element contrasting with the wet feminine is not specifically male (indeed, the an- cestors are symbolically androgynous), it is represented in the ritual by men, who therefore act the nobler and holier side. Much of the ritual takes the form of a battle between the two elements, in which the women are finally defeated. Indeed, the symbolism goes further. The feminine side, although defeated, is not simply driven out, even though at certain stages in the ritual it looks as if this is what is happening. Such a solution would be unthinkable, since it would imply that those who received the blessing would be made ancestors by it, in other words, would be killed. Instead, the feminine element which has been driven out is recovered but conquered, to be con- sumed symbolically by the ancestral, which then incorporates it. This second part of the defeat of the feminine is symbolised by acts which are the equivalent of rape. Given all this, we could be excused for expecting that women would be unwilling participants in such a ritual. In fact, the opposite is the case. The explanation for this rather strange fact lies in the dual- istic Merina notion of the person. For the Merina everyone is, while alive, a complex balance between a vital and feminine side and a growing ancestral side. The ancestral side is imper- sonal and represents the descent group in the self. As a result, its victory is the victory of the ancestral side of the self. This is true for both men and women, and so women in the circumci- sion ritual are taking part in a dramatic struggle in which they can see themselves both as vanquished and humiliated and as victors and celebrants. Indeed, the same could be said to be true for the boy who is being circumcised, since the ritual acts out both his conquest and consumption, marked by the wound of the operation and in a multitude of other symbolical ways, and his victory as a descent-group being. In this light it be- comes easier to understand women's willing participation in a ritual which might also be seen as humiliating them. They are willing and eager participants because in that context at least their identity as descent-group members predominates over their identity as females. The matter is not, however, quite as simple as this. Al- though women and men can both be seen as equally divided between two sides, Merina symbolism also implies that men become ancestral sooner than women, in part as a result of the fact that they are circumcised and women are not. Behind the apparent equality there does indeed lie a legitimation of in- equality, but a much more subtle and complex one than might have appeared at first, and this complexity still allows for women to be able to welcome their own humiliation. Indeed, this complexity has other political implications. As noted above, the circumcision ritual became during the 19th century a major royal ritual in which the subjects were repre- sented as the children of the ruler. Clearly, such a representa- tion can be understood as legitimating state domination. It is even easy to see how it would have emotional meaning for the subjects in that they could then represent their participation, even though this marked their inferiority, as a glorification of themselves as members of a group which reproduced itself by the symbolic conquest of new generations. Here again, the same pattern that we saw with the women recurs. It makes it possible for people to see their submission as part of a process of symbolical reproduction in which all are conquerors and conquered at the same time, while in fact they are also being conquered absolutely. This, the book suggests, is the mechanism which makes ideology and the legitimation of domination possible. Such an answer has very broad theoretical implications. What is ar- gued is that, at bottom, all ideology is concerned with mortal- ity and the experience of insufficient control. This experience is dealt with by religious alienation, which consists in a devalua- tion of this life so that it may be replaced with a transcendental 351</page><page sequence="4">order, a form of immortality, created in ritual by antithetical symbolism. This practice, fundamental to all religions, be- comes a legitimation of domination so long as one group can then be represented as mediators of the death-defying tran- scendental to the polluted existence with which it has been contrasted. Such mediators not only are closer to the tran- scendental but become the legitimate users and moulders of the non-transcendental, since as mediators they are concerned with the presence of the transcendental in the nontran- scendental. In this way ideology merges the symbolism of reproduction and the victory over death with that of domina- tion. Ideology is therefore anchored at the most fundamental level of human experience, and this has its own implications. The basis of ideology is the symbolic devaluation of this life relative to the transcendental. Once the threshold of turning against the value of this earthly creativity has been crossed, an almost infinite number of inequalities can be legitimated on the same basis. Thus we find that the same symbolism can equally legiti- mate gender hierarchy, the domination of elders, or the domi- nation of rulers within a state; indeed, in this example all these legitimations occur, either together or separately. This general- ity of ideology is one of its basic characteristics and explains its historical stability as it is recovered from one group of dominators by another. 3. The next question to be considered concerns the nature of religious knowledge. The ritual creates, however hazily, an image of the world that is dominated by the principles of de- scent and that, in its ultimate implications, denies the relevance of the passage of time and of the moral implication of the processes of birth and death. There are two ways in which this image could be considered. On the one hand, it could be ar- gued that it is a cosmology, a master plan organising Merina cognition. On the other hand, it could be argued that it is only one among others, an ideological construct existing in contrast to non-ideological cognition. This is the position which is taken in the book. Two arguments are invoked in support of this position. The first concerns the way the ritual creates its image of a timeless world. Above all this is done by antithesis. For example, the ritual seems to argue that true birth is brought about by the process of blessing of which the circumcision ritual is a part. Paradoxically, and the paradoxical seems typical of religion, this birth is identical to death, since one is fully born as a member of a descent group when one becomes an ancestor. Now, such a re-presentation is achieved dramatically by a quasi-theatrical demonstration of the lack of value of what may be called "biological birth." This shows that the denial of something by antithesis calls at the same time for the recogni- tion of its existence and seems to me sufficient evidence that the ideological representation does not obliterate all other knowl- edge. The second reason for arguing that the image constructed during the ritual cannot be taken as a "cosmology" lies in the non-discursive nature of ritual communication. Communicat- ing through song, dance, formalised speech, and material sym- bols, the participants in the ritual process begin to lose their individual ability to control what is being expressed. This means that the experience which is created remains largely isolated from non-ritual communication, as though it were per- manently in inverted commas (Sperber). Thus there cannot be a way whereby this type of knowledge can merge unprob- lematically with other types of knowledge. Ideology, it is argued, is created in a society such as that of the Merina very largely through rituals, which are matters of throwing oneself into the beyond by representations which must be experienced as both true and false, that is, as paradox- ical. As a result, the emotions of ritual colour but do not ex- haust knowledge; they intensify and fade at different moments, 352 moments governed by circumstances quite external to ideol- ogy. 4. Finally, we can consider the question of violence. That violence should be so prominent in a ritual of blessing is at first sight surprising, and it becomes all the more arresting when we realize that the element of violence is prominent in all initiation rituals and also in large numbers of other rituals, such as sacrifices. The answer suggested in the book is that violence is an inevitable consequence of the symbolical construction of the transcendental and that this symbolic basis has important political and ideological consequences. As noted above, the transcendental is constructed on the negation of the value of this world and a valuation of a life-and-death-defying alterna- tive. This presents a problem for a ritual such as this, which is, in part at least, concerned with the continuation of life in this world. The apparent contradiction is resolved by acting out the conquest of this world by the transcendental, a conquest which is in the hands of the representatives of the transcendental. This explains why the circumcision ritual, like all initiation rituals, begins with the symbolism of death, since it is first concerned with leaving this world behind but then goes on to act out a violent re-entry into the world. The child, having been symbolically killed and taken to the ancestors in the first part of the proceedings, is returned to the symbols of earthly existence, which he can then legitimately enjoy as a superior being who consumes it for his higher ancestral purposes. In this way the creation of the transcendental seems to lead logi- cally to violence and conquest. Within the confines of the descent group, such violence and conquest may be understood simply within the idiom of repro- duction; that is, each generation is conquered and consumed by the ancestors through blessing so that it may, in its turn, conquer the next, thereby maintaining the transcendental per- manence of the ancestral order. However, when we remember that the circumcision ritual was at certain times not just a familial but also a state ritual, the significance of the conquest and consumption represented in its symbolism begins to take on other overtones. In one sense, the symbolism is the same in either case. In the state rituals the whole kingdom, represented as one large descent group, was seen as reproducing itself through time by means of such practices as the royal circumci- sion ritual and the violence it implied; indeed, this is how the matter was presented by rulers to their subjects in the speeches they made on such occasions. However, this equation of the state and the descent group was somewhat disingenuous, since, although subjects were talked of as if they were the children of the ruler, they lacked the essential characteristic of true descendants-that of being successors. In other words, the symbolical conquest of juniors by elders implied in the circumcision ritual was in the case of state rituals one that did not promise the conquered a similar conquest of their own. The symbolism of reproduction has thus imperceptibly become merely the symbolism of violent subordination. The implications of this transformation do not, however, end here. In all the rituals examined in the book, what is conquered and consumed is not just the next generation, which will conquer in its turn, but also non-human species such as cattle and wild plants. In the ritual these are symbolically conquered absolutely by those who have allowed themselves to be conquered by the ancestors. When the ritual became a state ritual, this "external" conquest was emphasised, and the non- descent elements conquered came to be associated with non- Merina, whose symbolical role became something like that of cattle in sacrifice. The state ritual of circumcision became, in this way, a celebration of Merina aggression towards neigh- bours and outsiders. This element was emphasised by the growing role of the Merina army in the royal circumcision rituals during the 19th century. In this way the symbolical conquest of new generations by their moral side, that is, by CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="5">their ancestors, which, as we have seen, lies at the very heart of the symbolism of Merina circumcision, was imperceptibly transformed into the image of military conquest-the passage from blessing to violence had shifted from religious symbolism to an exhortation to military violence. Reviews by GERALD M. BERG Department of History, Sweet Briar College, Sweet Briar, Va. 24595, U.S.A. Bloch's plea for a historical approach to ritual ought to be welcomed by historians, who will find in his nuanced under- standing of dialectics a less formulaic analysis than is often perceived by historians looking for theoretical insights in an- thropology. I wonder, however, whether history can bear the heavy burden of transcending the theoretical problems arising from the attempt to link cultural phenomena such as ritual to politicoeconomic conjunctures. Nevertheless, Bloch's call for a history of the relation of ritual to practical knowledge should provide a promising agenda, and I attempt here only to call attention to several historical questions raised by his analysis. The functional pattern to circumcision ritual as described by Bloch accords well with what we know of other Merina rituals, such as those concerning protective amulets known as sampy. Here too, what started off two centuries ago as a familial ritual defining hierarchy was gradually appropriated by rulers who transformed it into a baroque elaboration emphasizing royal domination. There was very little change in symbolic content except for the insertion of the monarch at the apex of the ritual hierarchy, much like the substitution of the monarch as the breaker of the gourd in circumcision ritual. Thus, despite ex- traordinary politicoeconomic change, sampy ritual, like that of circumcision, shows considerable "plasticity," allowing for a variety of functional roles over time. But sampy ritual seems at times to be less isolated from social reality than Bloch's general theory would allow. For example, when muskets became a critical aspect of coercive power in the late 18th century, they were substituted for cattle in ritual offerings to superiors, thus recognizing symbolically what was indeed a social fact. This leads us to consider what is perhaps Bloch's most im- portant conclusion: the relative stability of ritual symbols aris- ing from the disconnection of ritual knowledge and practical knowledge. This disconnection would be all the more striking in circumcision ritual, since circumcision marks the passage of an initiate into a descent group based on land, a passage of utmost practical significance in that land, for a good portion of the period in question, was the principal source of wealth. Therefore, before accepting this disconnection, some attention needs to be paid to matters of landownership and exploitation. In the early 18th century land was owned by those who resided on it and cultivated it. Towards the middle of the century, however, the widespread construction of large irrigation sys- tems brought with it a transformation in landownership. Land passed from the individual households so devalued in circum- cision ritual to those who constructed and maintained irriga- tion systems, namely, the deme hierarchy that was exalted in circumcision ritual. Ultimately, by the end of the 18th century, rulers gained control of irrigation systems, and accordingly their rights in land grew. If, as Bloch convincingly demon- strates, the central symbolic content of circumcision ritual ex- presses the transcendence of the deme over the divisiveness of households, ritual at its very heart was an exact reflection of the social realities of agrarian production. Moreover, the intru- sion of royalty into the ritual accurately mirrored the ruler's dominant position in the ordering of land use. It would seem, therefore, that the relation of ritual symbols to practical knowl- Vol. 27 *No. 4 *August-October 1986 edge was quite intimate and that ritual was less a masking of the social formation by fuzzy ritual language than an almost contractual expression of it in a form perhaps similar to the Franco-German Armistice of 1940, which couched domination in terms of the rights of nations. Thus, violence begat blessings of a sort. Bloch's point that would-be rulers knew what they were doing when using rituals suggests that at least for a por- tion of the population symbols had an exact and rational refer- ence to the real world. It was during a later period, with the decline of monarchy and the imposition of colonial rule, that the symbols lost their reference to the real world and the distinction between ritual knowledge and practical knowledge became a yawning gap. Land was no longer the principal source of power; urban pro- fessionals, bureaucrats, and merchants replaced the deme hierarchy as the major social formation of power. Thus we might posit two phases in the history of conjunction between ritual and practical knowledge: one in which ritual expressed contractually the social hierarchy based on land and controlled by the descent group and another, beginning in the 1860s, in which symbols came to refer less to the real world than to the perfect world beyond death. As Bloch suggests, ritual in the second phase expressed a desire for order and tradition which might overcome the social displacements of the colonial period and provide a language of comfort for individuals seeking a means of group identity. In this historical scheme, symbols remain constant over two centuries although their meanings change as they refer to new social realities. The emotional appeal of ritual derived in the first phase primarily from the legal order established through ritual and in the second phase from the comfort provided by participating in a sacred tradition. For both phases, as Bloch states, ritual legitimized authority. What is lacking is more historical information about changes in landownership, changes in the rights and obligations of initiates with regard to land and other forms of wealth, variation in the performance of circumcision rituals among outgroups such as slaves or hin- terland demes far from power, and changes in the relation of urban to rural elites at the close of the 19th century. It is a measure of the power of Bloch's analysis that these issues can be examined within a coherent theoretical frame which inte- grates a wide variety of historical perspectives. by TOMAS GERHOLM Department of Social Anthropology, University of Stock- holm, Stockholm, Sweden. Bloch's new book is anthropology at its best: detailed ethnog- raphy made to speak to central theoretical issues. The 200-year record of continuity and change in a single ritual is a unique contribution to the literature. The space that has been allotted to me could be used entirely for praising the book, but let me instead move directly to some of its more dubious points. I shall be concerned with Bloch's claim that historical analysis solves or bypasses the problems that have bedevilled intellec- tualist/symbolic as well as functionalist approaches. I also have some quarrel with his view of the essence of ritual and espe- cially with the way he analyses the circumcision ritual as fall- ing between statement and action. The main finding of the historical analysis is that the very core of the circumcision ritual has not been affected by the spectacular events of the last two centuries of Merina history: "we are faced with an extraordinary stability" (p. 167). As Bloch notes, this stability is puzzling, especially since thefunc- tion of the ritual within the Merina social formation seems to have undergone major changes. If a ritual remains essentially unchanged throughout 200 years of recorded history, a reasonable conclusion would seem to be that history has very little to tell us about it. Bloch is 353</page><page sequence="6">convinced, however, that history does have the key, although two centuries are far too short a time for history to produce it. Given enough documentation, it would be possible to show how a ritual is gradually constituted by the addition of ele- ments and the transformation of existing ones (there are no zero points in history, no absolute beginnings, as Bloch use- fully reminds us). I agree, but this agreement is a matter of faith and not a result of his analysis. "Because only two hun- dred years will have been examined, only a part of the ritual can be accounted for" (p. 10). The truth is that no part of the ritual core has been accounted for. It is no mean achievement to have documented the social uses of the ritual, as Bloch has done, but it is not tantamount to demonstrating the general superiority of historical analysis. What characterizes ritual, according to Bloch, is that it is neither statement nor action but something in between, show- ing elements of both. "Because of this any representation of the 'argument' of a ritual as such is misleading. But because ritual does have elements that are like statements, because it does retain some propositional force, the opposite attitude, which would deny any validity to an analysis of content of ritual, would also be misleading" (p. 10). Bloch tries to solve this problem by using the methods of the two extremes of his continuum, hoping, presumably, that they will balance each other and produce a picture of what lies in between. He starts by analysing the ritual symbolically "as though it were a proposition" and then "heavily qualifies this presentation, in part by examining its historical destiny" (p. 11). The problem with this procedure is that whereas the anal- ysis of the ritual as a statement is clear enough-in fact, hard to distinguish from any competent conventional analysis of the "meaning" of a ritual-it is very difficult to see in what the qualification might consist, beyond several reminders to the effect that the whole exercise is misleading if taken as anything but a ritual statement. This is the easy way out, and I do not think it will do. It allows Bloch to display his (considerable) gifts as an interpreter of "meaning" while at the same time telling us (following the lead of Sperber and others) "how totally wrong it is to ap- proach ritual and symbolism as though the task in hand was a matter of decoding and translation" (p. 10). Instead of letting this insight have direct consequences for his analysis, Bloch provides us with two different analyses, each in its way per- fectly conventional. Rather than adding up to a synthesis they produce only confusion. Bloch's unstated conclusion seems to be: this is what the ritual means, but you should not under- stand it to mean what I say it means. To see how Bloch gets bogged down in the same type of problems that have brought symbolic analysis into disrepute in certain quarters, let us look at just one little example of how he "reads" the circumcision ritual (p. 94): in order to replace birth, descent has to borrow from birth and biology a symbolism which in some ways almost undermines the whole basis of the ritual. The "non-biological" birth acts out metaphorically a birth that inevitably has to be indicated by ways which refer back to biol- ogy.... The symbolical problem is thought-provoking: even in a ritual process dedicated to negating the material process of existence there are, in the end, no resources available for doing this other than the process itself. The image conveyed is that of a ritual struggling to put a message across in words that seem to mean the opposite of what the ritual wants to say. Now, is this "symbolical prob- lem" a problem of the ritual and in the ritual, or is it a result of Bloch's (possibly mistaken) endeavour to find a clear message in the ritual? I think the latter is the case. It is by embarking on a conventional symbolic analysis that Bloch (1) finds one mes- sage which is in harmony with what he knows about Merina cosmology while (2) at the same time observing that this very message is contradicted by other elements in the ritual. Instead 354 of retracing his steps and trying out another platform for ritual analysis, another view of what ritual is, he comes up with the idea-which is strange even if we disregard the unfortunate anthropomorphic terminology-that the ritual is struggling to put a clear message across in spite of the ambiguous means at its disposal. Although Bloch's book is impressive in many ways, I doubt that his approach, even if rid of some of the weaknesses I have pointed out, will take us closer to an understanding of ritual. The conjunction of the anthropologist's ideal model of the ritual as a statement and the historian's sweeping account of its role in the Merina social formation leads Bloch away from the task of grappling with the ritual as an event- performed, watched, and experienced by individuals. In spite of Bloch's presence at almost a dozen such rituals, we get little sense of the "emotional climate" of the ritual. The words of the songs are painstakingly noted, but the sound of the music, the voices, the movement-that is, everything that (I would as- sume) makes the circumcision ritual an intense experience for everyone present-is strangely absent. When all this has been left out, it is not surprising that the analyst's focus ends up being that of "meaning," meaning that can be put into words. It is also not surprising that the final result becomes an over- dose of such meaning. by MANASSit ESOAVELOMANDROSO Department of History, University of Madagascar, B.P. 907, Antananarivo, Madagascar. Bloch sets out to show the importance of circumcision and tsodrano (benediction) among the 19th-century Merina and then continues his examination into the 20th century, even though contemporary Merina society differs fundamentally from that of the previous century. This is a shrewd apprecia- tion of the Merina by a scholar who has done much work on the subject and is held in high regard by his peers in Madagascar and in France. The most important aspect of the book is, in my opinion, the way he has organised his study of the 19th-century Merina. In Chapters 2 and 3 he uses in turn the transformations which took place within the areas of poli- tics and religion, the changes undergone by the localised groups that he calls "demes," and the successive modifications in the circumcision ritual to characterise in a new way succes- sive periods of the 19th century (the reigns of An- drianampoinimerina, Radama I, Ranavalona I, and Radama II and the government of Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony). Un- like some scholars, for the most part 19th- and 20th-century Malagasy, who stress Andrianampoinimerina (calling him "the unifier of Imerina" and seeing him as the organiser of the king- dom), Radama I ("modernist king" and "unifier of Madagas- car"), and Ranavalona I (defender of the ancestral heritage), and unlike others, mainly Europeans and Malagasy Chris- tians, who prefer to emphasise Radama I, Radama II, and Rainilaiarivony, who all played a part in opening their country up to Western influences, Bloch focuses on the reigns of Ranavalona I and Radama II as the pivotal period of the 19th century. Ranavalona I fought Christianity because, in her eyes, it posed a threat to her power, her legitimacy, and-since poli- tics and religion were still inseparable-her sanctity. In con- trast, under Radama II religion and politics were distinguished and religion became an institution separate from Merina monarchy. Bloch subtly analyses the attitude of Ranavalona I towards Protestantism, the social origins of converts, the Ramanenjana movement during the reign of Radama II, and the causes and consequences of the conversion of the monarchy in 1869. The text deserves careful and considered study and suggests new and more rigorous directions for research. The brief account of the revolt of the Menalamba, of the nationalist CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="7">movements (Vy Vato Sakelika and 1947), and of the Anko- ton'ny Kongresy ny-Fahaleovantena Malagasy is fascinating and suggestive, though it deserves more detailed study either by Bloch or by other researchers. One reservation, however: there is no mention of Rainilaiarivony's role in the founding of the "Palace Church," which, organised by him as a means of achieving political domination, should have been distinguished from the other Protestant churches. Bloch's book raises many important themes not only for the history of the Merina but also for the history of Madagascar. One of these themes is the relationship between politics and religion or, more precisely, the manipulation of religion for political ends. The reign of Andrianampoinimerina was rich in religious innovation. To consolidate his power, the great king not only strengthened established institutions (for example, royal traditions such as circumcision) but also introduced, im- posed, and maintained the cult of the royal sampy. Ranavalona I based her legitimacy on her relationship to her ancestors, whom she represented as the ancestors of all Merina. The state therefore was conceived as a vast descent group with the queen at its head. In her hands its political power increased with the growing bureaucracy and army but also through the strengthening of the cult of the royal sampy; state rituals such as thefandroana or royal bath and the circumcision of Prince Rakotondradama (later Radama II) became more and more grandiose. Religion also became the tool of those who resisted royal power, as occurred during the Ramanenjana, which the enemies of Radama II used to fight his liberalisation policies and which became the rationale for his assassination. Finally, it was religion-or, more precisely, Protestantism, which had been selected and imposed as the state religion-which Rainilaiarivony utilised to reaffirm his personal power and to govern the "Kingdom of Madagascar." Religion also played a role in the resistance of the Menalamba and of the partisans of the VVS and the Mouvement Democratique de la Renovation Malgache, who used "ancestral religion" against Christianity, which was seen as imported and foreign. In this way religion served a dual purpose, supporting and legitimising the domi- nation of those who held positions of power but also inspiring ordinary people who rebelled against that domination. Al- though those in power and those who opposed them often adhered to two different religions, they sometimes supported the same Christian religion for contradictory purposes (for ex- ample, during the rule of Rainilaiarivony and in the 20th cen- tury). The other important theme is the notion of "deme," which Bloch develops in Chapter 3. This concept, which he has used since the 1960s, describes the foko or fokonolona, the village community, and deserves further discussion by scholars in the human sciences or social sciences working on Imerina and other areas of Madagascar. According to Bloch, the deme, which is the focus of rural social organisation, is a descent group with a common origin associated with a specific terri- tory. The members of this unit are heirs to rights to this ances- tral territory, and on it they build their tombs, which symbolise the unity of the people with their land and illustrate the sol- idarity of the members among themselves and with their ances- tors as well as the permanence of the spiritual bonds between the living and the dead. Demes have undergone major trans- formations during the 19th and 20th centuries, and these are clearly explained. Endogamy within the deme is an aspect of the members' duty towards their ancestors, intended as it is to prevent the dispersal of people and rights to the land. Since Merina kinship is bilateral and therefore both boys and girls belong to the demes of both their parents and inherit rights to land from them, exogamy would present a threat to their integrity. Deme endogamy occurs in many regions of Madagascar; the bilat- erality of Merina kinship is, however, exceptional and needs to be studied further. Since the 19th century, particularly in the Vol. 27 *No. 4 *August-October 1986 marginal regions of Imerina, Andrianampoinimerina and suc- cessive rulers, using their right as "owners of the kingdom," gave individuals a variety of types of land which had previ- ously been beyond the control of the demes, a process which was completed by the generalisation of land registration during the colonial period. This means that the situation as regards inheritance was different before the reign of Andrianam- poinimerina and has been changing ever since. Nevertheless, the cohesion of demes is an important fact right up to the present day, and from this emerges the third important theme which is raised by Bloch, the significance of "tradition" or "traditional authority." In considering the 19th century and, even more so, the 20th, he stresses the opposition between the urban and the rural worlds. This opposition has its origin in the Manichaean view in rural communities of the town as the root of all evil and the rural world as the preserver of tradition and thus the guardian and defender of all that is good. But what is this tradition? The "tradition" invoked by Ranavalona was very different to the "tradition" invoked by Rainilaiarivony and used by him to rule the country, and it in turn differed from the "tradition" ad- vocated by the VVS or the MDRM and also from the "tradi- tion" of the rural communities that have continued to reject in its name all forms of government since 1960. Tradition is not one thing but many and is continually being created; it is an ideological exercise used to mobilize rural communities against towns and the power which emanates from them. This ex- plains "the extraordinary power of traditional authority" re- ferred to by Bloch in Chapter 8. It is this power which explains the failure of governments, whether royal or colonial or repub- lican, to break down the demes so that they would have to deal only with isolated individuals. Bloch's book is rich and stimulating; much more than simply a commentary on circumcision and tsodrano, it is an important contribution to the history of power in Imerina. Although writ- ten by an anthropologist, it is sure to delight historians of Madagascar, although they may have some reservations con- cerning its overall plan (which leads to redundancy between Chapters 2 and 3 and an awkward break between Chapters 6 and 7) and may find some assertions insufficiently documented. by SUZETTE HEALD Department of Sociology, University of Lancaster, Lancaster LA1 4YL, England. Over the last 15 years, Maurice Bloch has produced a number of provocative theses on the nature of ritual. He has elaborated upon the theses that religion is the most extreme form of tradi- tional authority and that it is a tool of hierarchy, definitionally false and, in hiding the world, opposed to natural logic. The impact of his work has come not only from his attack on the more positive evaluation of ritual in social anthropology, where, following Durkheim, it has been seen as the source of the cosmological, moral, and social schemas of society, but from the intriguing way his theses have been linked. In this latest book, the presentation of religion as ideology is again his main purpose, but his focus has shifted to history. His aim is to establish through historical analysis the relation- ship of ideology, as exemplified in a ritual, and the social for- mation. This takes us to the heart of social theory, to the conditions of reproduction which have been seen as predicated upon ideology. Taking a 200-year span of Merina history, Bloch details the changing nature of the circumcision ritual. In the first half of the 19th century the ritual developed from a small familial celebration to become a grandiose display of royal might congruent with both the centralisation of the king- dom and its opposition to the imperialist powers. However, with the acceptance of Christianity as the Merina state religion in 1869 it went into a decline as a national ritual and even apparently as a familial one, becoming small-scale and largely 355</page><page sequence="8">hidden. Yet the story is not over, for the decade after Indepen- dence saw its resurgence as a family and descent-group ritual and a vector for Merina traditionalism, a development which BlocI relates to growing rural opposition to the powerful urban elites. Yet amid so much change in its political use, in its function, he finds that the symbolic patterning of the ritual remained surprisingly static. On this level, what is documented, then, ic an elaborate negative instance and one which it might b( thought would destroy the idea of ritual as ideology, as in th( more normal usages of that term (i.e., as a reflection of mate- rial interests and specifically those of the hegemonic class) il surely would. But Bloch, working within an original Enligh- tenment antithesis which opposes ideology as illusion to sciencc as true knowledge, finds in this lack of adaptability-the ver~ insensitivity of the ritual to changing political circumstance- further evidence for its ideological status. On the one hand, much of its content may be said to be irrelevant, since as long as it allows the powerful to identify with the source of tran- scendental authority its legitimating function is assured. Morc central to Bloch's purpose, however, is to specify the nature oi the content of ritual which contrasts it to non-ritual knowledge and which might explain both its power and its stability. To a large extent the argument here is an elaboration on earlier ones (Bloch 1974, 1977). First, the peculiar character oi ritual communication, its formalisation and repetition, createE the possibility of a break with normal cognition and knowl- edge. Indeed, it is isolated from it "in a heavy world between actions and statements" (p. 188) and does not compete with it. Ultimately, however, Bloch argues that the ritual constituteE an attack on non-ritual experience, creating "the ordered tran- scendental by devaluation of the value of human experience and action" (p. 175), and that this is true not only of Merina circumcision ritual but of all ritual. Ritual is thus opposed in two senses to non-ritual knowledge: it is both insulated from it and antagonistic to it. The one allows the other, and while this can presumably explain the stability of form, by the same to- ken it renders ritual so truly ineffectual that its supposed sub- versive message appears hardly relevant. Further, people's participation in ritual, by this turn of argu- ment, is rendered problematic. This becomes a central prob- lem for Bloch, who asks why women, for example, should participate so enthusiastically in a ritual which he sees as humiliating them. Some options are ruled out by his position. Thus he rejects a conspiracy theory on the grounds that this presents an implausible view of human motivation and a social-determination-of-knowledge position on the grounds that the study proves the opposite, that is, the lack of conjunc- tive response. The view that the rituals do not codify social relationships solves part of his problem: the women are only acting a part. Other answers he suggests may be found in the nature of the symbolism itself and the fact that women too may ultimately identify with its message. The central ritual act is the act of blessing (tsodrano) ir which, immediately following the circumcision, an elder blows water over the child, thus transferring "the power, the life force and the fertility of previous generations" (p. 41). But the medium of the blessing, the water, is associated not with an cestral power but with the "unappropriated fertility of th4 land," with the defeated Vazimba, the autochthonous but dis possessed owners of the land (and of all those who leave nc living descendants). Vazimba power is thus outside ancestra power and is associated with powerful (muhery) wild things But it is also associated with the natural fertility of people anc as such with women, birth, procreation, and the child himself Children are thought of as matrilineally created. The circumci sion of the boy at the age of two or three is thus criticall3 important for his incorporation into the bilateral desceni group, the deme, and the establishment of patrifiliation. Ir this, it is both a second birth and a harbinger of death, a firs step towards the dry, cold tomb in which all descent-grout 356 members are finally interned and become impersonal, indivis- ible, and eternal. The solid rock of the tomb is an apt symbol of the enduring deme. The act of blessing is thus profoundly ambiguous, combin- ing as it does ancestral and muhery power. What is the rela- tionship between them? At the most obvious level, what the ritual may be stating is the necessity of both elements for suc- cessful life; the powers of ancestry must harness or incorporate the vitality of the Vazimba. Perhaps, too, descent must be represented as supreme. It is here that Bloch finds the main clue to interpreting many aspects of the ritual; in the interest of descent (and, by implication, death/eternal life), muhery ele- ments are vilified, captured, and conquered by violence. Some aspects of the violence that surrounds various episodes in the ritual thus become explicable, but the question of the interpretation of action as violent and thus as violating arises. As he sees it, such violence is largely gratuitous, an aspect of the devaluation of this world and specifically of human vitality and femininity. Yet many of the acts presented in this way as violent are, from another point of view, necessary and in- trinsic, essential, indeed, for life and reproduction. There is no space to detail the ethnography, but the question is, are the mock battles, cuttings, and consumptions an aspect of negative violence and thus to be seen as a denigration of non-ancestral power, or are they, alternatively, establishing, by an eleborate metaphor, a particular mode of creation whereby "violence" releases generative potential? An image of vegetative propaga- tion pervades the ritual. Thus, it could be argued that the cutting of the child establishes in a fairly straightforward way his independent fertility, in the same way that a plant scion is removed from the parent stock. The "violence" then is no more than is necessary and positive, not negative and denying. If, at the moment of circumcision, "femininity" is undervalued, this occurs in a context in which previously it was overvalued as the only source of creation. Of course, both aspects are proba- bly implied, and Bloch's treatment of the complex oppositions set up in the ritual is often fascinating. The issue is whether, in the interest of giving an almost rhetorical flourish to his nega- tive opinion of ritual action, he does not overstress the element of violent conquest. A tendentious note is sometimes struck, as, for example: "Once the child has been conquered in his muhery, feminine aspect he himself then becomes the violent conquerer of the same entity. He reenters the female house through the window, an act full of violence and sexuality" (p. 172). Yet in his earlier account of this episode, Bloch writes that after the circumcision and blessing, "the terrified and cry- ing child was handed back to his real mother through the window.... The child was comforted by his mother inside the house and was given a chicken to be cooked for him later" (p. 80). I think we have reason to wonder whether this should really be construed as an act of violent conquest. The questions that do not go away are the same as those raised by Beidelman (1966) in his critique of Gluckman's rituals-of-rebellion thesis. These are the basic questions of at- tributing meaning to action. If, as Bloch maintains, the for- malisation of ritual in action renders it uncreative for the par- ticipants, the same cognitive constraintg do not hold when it comes to exegesis, which would appear to free the creative imaginations of both participants and observers. Then, as he recognises, symbols are subject to constant manipulation, pro- ducing an infinite regress of meaning. Yet are symbols really so slippery? The doubt that remains is that this is an artifact of method, a product of anthropological decontextualisation. Bloch raises this question forcefully, and, though he does not solve it, the original way in which he sets up the problem and worries the issues through will undoubtedly stimulate debate. Other readers will enjoy as I have his puzzling out of Merina circumcision ritual, which, even when explored through his- tory, function, and meaning, reveals itself as surprisingly underdetermined . CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="9">by J. D. Y. PEEL Department of Sociology, University of Liverpool, Liver- pool, England. This is a complex and impressive book which requires evalua- tion at several distinct levels. It belongs to that genre in an- thropology which seeks to draw from the detailed analysis of some aspect of the life of one people far-ranging generalizations about the nature of Man or Society. It is perhaps the most ambitious essay of its kind by a British anthropologist since the works of Mary Douglas and Victor Turner in the 1960s. Like those works, it is focussed on ritual, and even though it comes to radically opposed conclusions it still has much of the 1960s about it. The main argument of the book arises from an ethnographic puzzle. Rich source materials from the 19th century enable Bloch to show that the symbolic structure of a major cultural phenomenon-the Merina circumcision ritual-has changed remarkably little over two centuries of very eventful history. Once an irregularly performed family rite, it became part of a regularly enacted state ritual associated with taxation and mili- tary enrolment; then, after the adoption of Christianity, it re- verted to being a private, small-scale affair, and latterly it has revived as a vehicle of rural, anti-elite sentiment. Thus there is no "correspondence" of culture and society in either of the opposed ways in which Durkheimian anthropology and Marx- ism have conceived it. Put another way, the Merina situation affronts the theory of the "bourgeois Marx," Pareto, that it is the cultural rationalizations ("derivations") which show enor- mous variety, while the interests which they serve ("residues") are few and constant. This combination of symbolic stability and ideological plasticity highlights the limitations of both ma- jor anthropological approaches to religion, intellectualism and sociological functionalism. It is historical analysis which has revealed the problem. Bloch adds his voice to those that would argue for an an- thropology that takes proper cognizance of the essential histor- icity of its subject matter. Specifically, he argues that by "analysing how the ritual is manifested in history" we may avoid the limitations of both intellectualism ("the search for meaning, though not pointless, has no end" [p. 11]) and func- tionalism ("the uncertainties of seeing what [rituals] do for par- ticipants" [p. 183]). But since history deals with nothing other than the interplay of intentions and effects, it is optimistic to hope that it can bring any final or certain solution to these old anthropological snags. In fact, Bloch uses history in a very particular way, to complement his theory of ritual. It is a paradoxical history, since ritual is doubly against change: it changes little itself, and it conveys a sense of social timelessness to its participants. This timelessness arises in part from the content of this particular ritual and in part, Bloch argues, from the nature of ritual itself. His contention on the latter point is that, because ritual shares the properties of both statements and actions, it is weakly propositional and therefore highly adaptable to novel situations. Actually, a fuller integration of history and anthropology would put Bloch's problem-cultural continuity combined with structural change-in a rather different light. Before he comes to the analysis of the circumcision ritual itself, Bloch presents two background chapters on Merina society and his- tory. Each is well done in itself, but their disjunction is strik- ing. One deals with the politico-religious history, and the other, in an anthropological mode, presents "social organiza- tion and religion. " Moreover, the former deals with the Merina state, the latter with village-level society; and while religion appears as a common theme, it is the vicissitudes of Christian- ity which predominate in the first case and "traditional reli- gion" in its most enduring elements in the second. What in the end slips through the categories here is a proper social history of the relations of state and society, of religous change and ritual stability. Vol. 27 *No. 4 *August-October 1986 The centrepiece of the book is a brillant and detailed account of the circumcision ritual itself that derives its cogency not only from the analysis of the symbolism but from its thorough grounding in the relevant social institutions: the village com- munity or "deme," descent groups, gender relations, authority patterns, etc. When circumcision became part of the royal ritu- als of the Merina state, the latter's power depended on the successful transference to the state of commitments engendered in the local community. Here Bloch's account has very impor- tant comparative implications-not especially emphasized by him here-for our understanding of political development in other African kingdoms of the 18th and 19th centuries such as Asante and Dahomey. It demonstrates how, far from requiring the destruction of lower-order institutions like lineages, polit- ical centralization may gain vital support from their ideological appropriation. This in turn seems to depend on the continued existence and vitality of these local institutions. But if this is so, then the ritual continuity is itself less puzzling than Bloch makes out, for the local institutions are just such as any "social correspondence" theory would invoke to explain it. Instead, we have the irony of a "materialist"-as Bloch professes to be-making cultural continuity depend less on social condi- tions than on the nature of "ritual communication" itself. Bloch's broader argument about ritual is confused, but also in a sense made possible, by his using the word with a double reference. Most of the time, which includes his discussion of the circumcision ritual itself, it is in the usual, narrower sense of a certain kind of stereotyped performance, but elsewhere he adopts the structural-functionalist habit of using it virtually as a synonym for religion. Of course, ritual tends to be important in religion, though its importance there is highly variable. In the first chapter ("The Social Determination of Ritual") many of the theorists whom Bloch discusses were producing not a theory of ritual, but a theory of religion. The "intellectualists," indeed, explicitly argued against the centrality of ritual in reli- gion. Since the interplay or overlap of ritual, ideology, and religion in the making of a history is precisely the issue to be resolved, this terminological confusion has serious conse- quences. The effect of this kind of metonymy-rather analo- gous to one which Bloch rightly deplores, the analysis of cul- ture in terms drawn from language-is to build a theory into a definition. Bloch effectively demonstrates that this ritual is the vehicle of ideology which sustains authority, but does it follow that "ritual has the chief burden of carrying ideology" in Merina society (p. 176)? If "ritual" is here intended in the narrower sense, it seems empirically doubtful, since much of Merina religion seems not to have the stability of the circumcision ritual. There appears to be much change, we learn in passing, in the cults attaching to Vazimba spirits and to sampy (fetishes); and, in any case, "the most important feature of the religious life of present-day Merina is that they are Christians" (p. 39). If, on the other hand, he means "ritual" in a sense equivalent to religion, the proposition may stand but has to be detached from his specific theory about the importance of stereotyped "ritual communication." The basic problem here is again how to move back from a system of abstracted dichotomies (ritual/non-ritual, stability/change, village/state), each of which has analytical value, to the synthesis of causes working through time which must be the objective of a histor- ical anthropology. It is from the close detail of the circumcision ritual itself that Bloch draws his broadest anthropological assertions. The ritual has the general form of a "blessing" bestowed by elders on the child; its main sociological message is to elevate descent- group solidarity (symbolized by the tomb and the ancestors) over division and dispersal (symbolized by the house and the real parents, especially the mother). But the things of life and natural power (muhery) which are conveyed in the elders' blessing, whose key symbol is water, are also the very things 357</page><page sequence="10">whose unruliness threatens the order of the descent group. The ritual therefore enacts their forceful subordination and de- values those social elements (e.g., women on their own rather than as descent-group members) which correspond to them. Equally convincing is his assessment of the historical sig- nificance of the ritual when it was taken over by the Merina state. Its message that cultural maleness requires the conquest of the "feminine" part of the self corresponded nicely with the requirement for the Merina to be subdued, by their rulers, before they could subdue neighbouring peoples in 19th-century Madagascar. So far, so good. But Bloch's argument here switches into another mode. Shedding the deliberate care with which he has elucidated the ritual's symbols in social and historical context, he suddenly tells us that the ritual is against "creativity," that it "cultivates the hatred of life for the sake of authority" (p. 175). This goes beyond free translation to the tendentious elaboration of what the ritual "says." The Merina have become a vehicle for a contemporary Western Weltanschauung. The simplest level of meaning in the Merina ritual is one that it shares with virtually all other rituals of initiation: a message that culture or, rather, this particular way of life depends on a mastery of natural powers and impulses and that its acquisition depends on the subordination of children to elders. It is the very banal ines- capability-or, to put it more bluntly, the truth-of such no- tions that makes them such a solid basis for the creation of more questionable forms of self-discipline and social hierarchy, as the Merina rulers realized. By contrast, Bloch implies a quite chimerical alternative, in which human "creativity" is somehow pre-cultural, in which full "creativity" and "life" can take place outside the cognitive and social structures through which all cultures are realized. When he attributes to ritual the proposition that "creativity is not the product of human action but is due to a tran- scendental force that is mediated by authority" (p. 187), the false antithesis is plain. Creativity, or the realization of a his- tory, depends both on human action and on criteria or catego- ries which are received as authoritative or even transcendent. Bloch here introduces the distinction between practical and ritual knowledge developed in some of his earlier writings. "Practical knowledge," insofar as this is supposed to result from experience unmediated by culture, is another head of the same chimera. The postulates of this argument-a naively em- piricist epistemology and a hippie ideology of liberation-have a definite whiff of the 1960s about them, but their roots lie farther back. The past in Bloch's present is not really Marx, even young Marx, but Rousseau. by ERIC R. WOLF Herbert H. Lehman College, City University of New York, New York, N.Y. 10468, U.S.A. This book once again establishes Maurice Bloch as one of the most thoughtful and innovative anthropologists at work at this time, if only because he strives to integrate and synthesize the various perspectives that have come out of functionalism, structuralism, and Marxism, rather than let the field slide into conceptual atomization. This study of how the Merina ritual of circumcision, first practiced on the household level, then pro- moted and intensified as a ritual of the developing Merina state, only to "descend" once more to the level of household and descent group after the end of Merina domination, is nota- ble for its detailed ethnography, its careful historical recon- struction, and its disciplined exercise of the anthropological imagination. The account benefits from Bloch's insistence that the way to understand ritual and its symbolic matrix is to study it in its development and trajectory over time, to map its re- sponses to major changes in the wider political-economic field. This allows one to see what changes but also to take note of what remains the same, and the continuity of Merina symbolic 358 forms in the midst of functional adaptations to political- economic change is the major theme of this book. To Bloch the circumcision ritual appears "almost as a barometer of the polit- ical situation," and yet the central symbolism exhibited by the rite demonstrates "an extraordinary stability" (p. 165). This counterpoint creates the tension and excitement that charac- terize the book. The Merina define circumcision as a blessing, but Bloch notes that the crucial idea informing that blessing is the taming of chaotic vitality by the imperatives of descent. The blessing is enacted in a ritual of violence. The child, kin to other wild and powerfully vital objects, is refashioned, transformed by the ritual into a being that derives its potency from incorporation into the ordered world of descent and its associated impera- tives of authority and obedience. This act is shown by Bloch to assume "central political significance," for it comes to stand as a key representation of conquest and obedience in the political sphere, as well as of control and orderly conduct in the sphere of the household. Here the book carries forward some central insights already formulated by Bloch in previous work. He argues that Merina circumcision, like other Merina rites and, indeed, "also others throughout the world" (p. 175), achieves this incorporation of the untamed and uncut being by creating "a transcendental order." This order negates and devalues workaday human life and experience by making ordinary existence subservient to a "higher" order. All such rituals make this same basic point, "the cultivation of the hatred of life for the sake of authority" (p. 175). This bears directly upon the understanding of ideol- ogy. Bloch argues that among the Merina ritual is the main carrier of ideology. It establishes the ancestors, rather than ordinary folk in their workaday world, as the true source of creativity, just as capitalist societies-according to Marx- constitute capital as the main source of creativity to which ordinary workers must subject themselves in the process of production. Yet there is also a difference. Under capitalism it is the creativity of labor that is devalued and fetishized; among the Merina ritual encompasses and subjugates both human labor and human reproduction. But Bloch does not leave it at this. He shows how ideology mystifies, but he also wants to explain how ideology exercises the compulsive power that makes people want to do what they have to do. Here he takes issue with other interpreters of ritual and ideology, those who see ideology primarily as cosmology, as organizing cognition and knowledge about the whole cos- mos, as well as those who stress the performative aspect of ritual while denying its capacity to express meaning. Instead, Bloch argues, ritual communication is powerful precisely be- cause it both secures "the prominence of the illocutionary act" over its "propositional force" and narrows its propositional capacity in order to install a particular and obligatory view of the world. Ritual makes use of the repetition of fixed forms to deny the variable particularity and specificity of events in favor of a fixed and timeless state that abrogates "the validity of this world" (p. 185). What gives ritual its power is that it "transforms" knowledge and experience in the real world into an assertion of "everybody's victory over this life and death" (p. 189). There are echoes here of Durkheim and Turner, as well as of Mannheim, Marx, and even Roland Barthes, but I was struck above all by remembrances of Freud, especially the Freud of Civilization and Its Discontents, with its central theme of vio- lence done to the free-floating vital energy of the id by the imposition of authority. There are good reasons that an- thropologists have hesitated to traffic with notions of "energy" and "libido," but when-with Bloch-we wish to understand how ritual and ideology exercise power within human beings, and not over human beings, a return to Freud is probably inevitable. Another theme, even more surprising perhaps in someone CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="11">raised within the British anthropological tradition, is the in- troduction or reintroduction of an almost Boasian concept of culture. Bloch concludes his study by advancing the notion that "different cultural phenomena react to events differently" (p. 194). Some parts of culture change, but others exhibit "long-term cultural continuities." There may well be an un- usual continuity of symbolic forms in Madagascar; writing from a rather different perspective than Bloch's, Kottak (1980) has similarly stressed the enduring significance of proto- Malagasy cultural forms and the tenacity of Malagasy groups in "preserving the essentials of an ancestral cultural plan, their fombandrazana, in the face of change" (p. 289). Yet similar claims about age-old continuities have been made by other scholars, working far away from Madagascar in Afro-American and Amerind America. There may be no more to say about this, especially if one is satisfied with the postulate of an un- fathomable Mind ever working along tracks laid out long ago in some dim and indefinable past. But one may surely raise the question of how such continuity-repetition and redundancy over long periods of time-is to be explained. Here Bloch may provide a clue when he says that "ritual is a vague, weakly propositional, construction of timelessness built upon an anti- thesis that will do for any domination" (p. 191, my emphasis). There may well be more explanatory power in this notion than Bloch makes use of in the present book. He argues, nega- tively, as it were, that the Merina forms stayed on track be- cause external forces were too weak to derail them. French defeat of Merina millenarian revolts closed off the potential development of heterodox alternatives, while any tendency to transform Merina ritual and ideology into political instrumen- talities to counter the dominance of the urban, Christian, mod- ernizing bourgeoisie proved ineffectual and ended in failure. Yet it may also be worthwhile to think of Merina ideology, positively, as an instrument in ethnic politics. The French strove to weaken Merina dominance, first through their poli- tique des races and, after World War II, through regional decentralization. At the same time, Merina-making use of early and privileged access to education-staffed the profes- sions and the lower rungs of the bureaucracy and took advan- tage of the peace imposed by the French to enlarge their com- mercial operations. As Bloch has well shown on numerous occasions, this development further displaced Merina from their ancestral homeland, placing them as emigrant colonists among other ethnic groups. It also posed for them in salient ways the opposition between adherence to ancestral custom and acceptance of European ways. Yet, beyond this, one may well ask whether this enhanced geographical and social mobil- ity did not create new resource-dispensing networks for the Merina. These not only might have enlarged opportunities but would have had to be secured against competitors from within the island or from abroad. Conceivably, continued assertion or revival of Merina ritual and symbolism might have played a part in such competition over resources. Bloch himself has stressed the key role of the Merina professional stratum, with its links to rich landowners and merchants in other parts of the island, as "the social focus of their descent groups, many mem- bers of which gained educational and administrative advan- tage from the prominence of their kinsmen" (p. 32). One might guess, then, that there is a relationship also between the main- tenance and intensification of Merina ritual and the intensified competition for access to resources, including those managed by the state, among state-making and state-dependent elites, together with their networks of retainers. As in other ethnically diverse situations, moreover, the enactment of ritual can also serve to counter any tendency of the poor to seek and find allies among non-Merina (p. 32); the rituals would remind all partici- pants of just who it is from whom all blessings flow. Thus further explanations for the persistence of Merina symbolic forms in the modern period may perhaps lie in the ongoing competition over control and influence in the political- Vol. 27 *No. 4 *August-October 1986 economic kingdom. The conquest of the putative original Vazimba inhabitants of Imerina by the Merina, adumbrated in the circumcision ritual as a conquest at once of self and of others, thus may have continued relevance in who gets what, when, and from whom. Reply by MAURICE BLOCH London, England. These reviews probe usefully most of the important issues raised in the book and are themselves significant contributions to the theoretical debate of which the book is a part. They offer welcome suggestions for further work. Perhaps Gerholm raises the most fundamental problem: does the historical approach to ritual really help in understand- ing the nature of the phenomena under examination? He doubts that it does, because he does not see the history binding into a synthesis the symbolical and sociological, and he is right in believing that this was my intention. In answer I would like to reiterate what it is that we have learnt by this way of looking at things and leave to the reader to decide whether such con- clusions have clarified the issue. First of all, this approach demonstrates the limitations of functionalist and other simple deterministic theories, which assume that a ritual such as the one under examination can be explained in terms of how it is employed at a particular mo- ment in time. The stability which is demonstrated clearly gives the lie to such an assumption, and such assumptions still im- plicitly underlie much social theory. At the same time, the prominence of instrumentality is made clear, and it is shown that it too must be taken into account, but in a more circum- spect way, in order not only to explain the way the ritual is carried out but also to explain those few aspects which do change. The complexity of the situation which is revealed be- comes an analysis of the character of what is being studied; it shows that not all aspects of the ritual are of the same kind, since they do not all change in the same way, and furthermore the nature of these different aspects is revealed precisely by the way they change or do not change with the passage of time. These points are themselves a challenge to another way of looking at rituals, which would have us view them as though they were models of and models for the world-a world which often seems outside history, as is indicated by the labelling of such images with a word such as "cosmology." The world with which the ritual has a relation is actually a continually chang- ing social world, and the relation between ritual and world must be indirect if we are to be able to understand the ritual's stability. What the historical destiny of the ritual tells us is that it must be both relevant to specific instances and not directly tied to these instances and that no blanket theory which sees it as either a reflection of events or a model for behaviour can achieve this. The history of the ritual has thus defined what it is that we must seek to understand, and, as far as I know, the problem has never been formulated in this way. Furthermore, the book does suggest an answer to the histori- cally formulated question and, more particularly, to the para- dox of the combination of stability and change. It is necessary to go over this explanation, since it is challenged in a number of reviews, notably those by Peel, Heald, and Gerholm. The basis of the argument is that ritual, like other religious phe- nomena, is an attempt to transcend this life but that this at- tempt is only possible with the means and images available in the world which is being denied. It is argued, therefore, that the core of the ritual consists in an opposition between, on the one hand, an image of the everyday world and its causation and, on the other, an image of a transcendental order, gov- erned by different principles, which is vaguely and allusively 359</page><page sequence="12">evoked in the ritual. The transcendental order appears to van- quish the everyday, but since it is created by the negation of the everyday it in fact cannot avoid at the same time implicitly demonstrating the latter's primacy. The recognition of this opposition is not a hangover from some kind of naive empiricism, as Peel seems to believe, or from an Enlightenment contrast between true natural knowl- edge and tainted cultural knowledge, as Heald suggests. If it were, it would indeed be untenable. Of course, knowledge cannot be a mere reflection of the world or a mere registering of the effects of the world on our senses; this goes without saying. We know from Piaget, as if Kant were not sufficient, that all knowledge is the product of construction and that this con- struction is in part cultural. I thought I had made this clear in the book, and I have spelt it out at length in a recently pub- lished version of lectures I delivered some time back (Bloch 1985). The recognition that knowledge is cultural does not, however, imply that it is all of a kind and that it relates to the world always in the same way. This is what I am arguing against, and the different stages in a ritual such as this illus- trate the point. First, I am stating that this ritual, like other religious phenomena, attacks operational knowledge in order to get to the "beyond," to "see the world differently as it would be without death," to see "the invisible," to "communicate with the dead," etc., all paradoxical things to do. Like all paradox this requires an implied negation of the everyday. Secondly, I am arguing that ritual is partly successful in this attempt to throw the participants into the "beyond" and that it does this by using a medium which appears to leave the world behind, if only for limited periods. Thirdly, I am showing that the process of apparently denying the everyday and leaving the world behind opens the door for the legitimation of authority and domination. Fourthly, I demonstrate that because legiti- mation is achieved by attaching authority to a process which attempts to transcend the world this legitimation is unspecific and therefore recoverable by one type of authority from an- other, hence its stability. This is not an empiricist argument, and its first step, which Peel feels has a whiff of "a hippie ideology of liberation," is in fact shared with that of a number of apologists of religion. The only element in the book not covered in the four points outlined in the previous paragraph is the way such a process requires actual and symbolical violence, which can then be- come the justification of state violence. Heald recognises the centrality of violence in the ritual, and indeed it would be difficult not to, given the continual spearings, killings, and woundings which it involves, but she criticises me for seeing this violence in a purely negative light. This is very far from my intention. There is no doubt that this violence can be seen as creative and illuminating; indeed, my argument is that it is precisely because it can be seen in this way that it is welcomed by those against whom it is directed and that it can thus func- tion as ideology. This, however, does not mean that it is for all that not real violence or potentially destructive. Anthropolo- gists often overlook the significance of violence in what they study and as a result are continually caught unawares and unprepared by dramatic transformations in the societies which they have represented as peaceable and sleepy. Heald is also mistaken when she doubts the violence in the symbolism of the re-entry of the child through the window after the operation, even though, as far as the child and its mother are concerned, the procedure may be more reassuring than anything else. The child is symbolically returning as a conqueror, in control of what previously controlled him, and this is well illustrated by the fact that among neighbouring peoples this symbolic re- entry involves breaking down the wall of the house of circum- cision with spears. While I have no doubt that the historical approach trans- forms many problems of theory that appear impossible to grasp by traditional anthropological methods so that they can be 360 dealt with positively, the practical problem of combining infor- mation from two academic traditions remains formidable. I had intended to leave general historical questions to the spe- cialists and invoke their work merely as background. This was in order to keep the project within reasonable limits and for reasons of space. The questions raised by Wolf, Berg, and Esoavelomandroso, however, show that the whole matter is not so simple. Wolf raises the question of how far the continuity, and in- deed revival, of traditional practices by the Merina in the 20th century may be explained in terms of the ethnic situation. There can be no doubt that this is an important element, and this point is probably insufficiently stressed in the book. The basic problem, nonetheless, remains, and such an observation would never explain why the ritual takes the particular form it does or why it has the power to move participants in the mean- ingful way it does. Berg is concerned with two more specific points. He argues that towards the end of the 18th century the property-owning aspect of the individual household was attacked by the cen- tralising state and that the anti-household symbolism in the ritual can be explained in this way. I am sceptical on this point for a number of reasons. First of all, I very much doubt that the evidence for such a change is available. Second, and more important, the symbolism of the house is so fundamental and found in so many parts of Madagascar that it is difficult to believe that it could have such a simple cause. Third, it seems odd if, as Berg suggests, the symbolism reacted in this direct way at a particular moment in history that it would then have stopped reacting when the property situation changed again, such as after the French conquest. Another point raised by Berg seems very interesting. He notes how the relative stability of the circumcision ritual con- trasts with the much more plastic response of other aspects of Merina religion, such as the sampy, which he has illuminat- ingly discussed. This is interesting not only in itself but also because a central question raised by the book and not properly examined is the differential response of different social phe- nomena to events. Esoavelomandroso also asks for further research within the framework suggested, especially for the period when Raini- laiarivony was in control. He is right in pointing out that this period is only cursorily dealt with. The reason is that it is a period for which the circumcision ritual is poorly documented. However, his remarks echo another criticism made by Peel- that the information on Christianity is insufficiently incorpo- rated into the main themes of the book. On reflection I can only agree. Overall, these requests for further research on the historical aspects seem to me encouraging. The book is, after all, in- tended to synthesise approaches from history and anthropology not just so that anthropologists and historians can pool their knowledge but so that the different theoretical traditions will interact creatively and we will be able to ask new and more probing questions of our material. I hope this has been achieved. References Cited BEIDELMAN, T. 0. 1966. Swazi royal ritual. Africa 36:373-405. [SH] BLOCH, M. 1974.
