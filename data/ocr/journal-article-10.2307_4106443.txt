<plain_text><page sequence="1">109 III. SYMPOSIUM: CAN INDIVIDUAL MINDS BE INCLUDED IN THE MIND OF GOD ? By HASTINGS RASHDALL, J. H. MUIRHIEAD, F. C. S. SCHILLER, and C. F. D'ARcY, Bishop of Down. I. By HASTINGS RASHDALL. I THINK it is unfortunate that this Symposium should be opened by one who gives the negative answer to the question. It will hardly be denied that this answer is the view of common- sense. I am very far from making common-sense, i.e., the average opinion of the unphilosophical, into a final court of appeal in matters of metaphysic. But the opening of such a discussion would seem naturally to belong to those who deny, rather than to those who affirm, on this particular matter what may be called the vulgar view. Moreover, the arrangement which has been adopted puts me under a peculiar disadvantage. It is a general principle of philosophic strategy that the offensive is the best defensive. And that is peculiarly the case on such a subject as the present: because the only kind of argument which is possible to a disputant who affirms what seems to him an obvious and self-evident truth is to exhibit the difficulties in which we are landed by the denial of it. Since, however, those who assail the common-sense thesis are by no means agreed either as to what they affirm or as to the grounds on which they affirm it, it will be always possible for my antagonist to contend that he is not responsible for the positions or for the arguments of any particular writer against whom I may have tilted. However, since it has been otherwise determined, and I have lost the advantage of position, I must do my best. To me it seems obvious and self-evident that a moment of</page><page sequence="2">110 HASTINGS RASHDALL. consciousness is always unique, and cannot be thought of as included in or forming part of some other consciousness. When this position is attacked, it is usual to mix it up with some quite different positions with which it is not necessarily connected. The maintainer of this thesis is made responsible for various theories about eternally pre-existent spirits or windowless monads or impenetrable individual minds, or for pluralistic denials that the Universe is a Cosmos, or the like. I am not now defending any of these views-none of which, indeed, I hold. Nor for the moment am I defending any particular theory of the Universe. I do not mind how close and intimate you make the union between the Divine Spirit and the lesser spirits which are supposed to be contained in it. The "Universal Mind" may have the most perfect and intimate knowledge of these spirits. He may know them, as the fashionable phrase is, from within. He may know all they know, experience all that they experience, apprehend the same world which they apprehend. They may be dependent upon Him in the most intimate manner conceivable. He may be the cause or the ground or the condition of their existence from moment to moment. They may with Him form an Absolute outside which nothing exists. I deny none of these things. What I am denying is simply that the consciousness at any moment of an individual mind can be thought of as at the same time part of a wider mind. Take, for instance, a moment of pain-say tooth-ache. I maintain that it is meaningless to say "The Universal spirit feels that tooth- ache: that tooth-ache is part of the experience of the Universal Mind, and there is no tooth-ache in the world which does not form part of it." I believe that to be equally the case with consciousness looked upon on the knowing side: it would equally be true of my consciousness of the most abstract truth. My knowledge of Euclid's axioms or Euclid's propositions is not at the same time part of the divine consciousness of them. But the difficulty of the position</page><page sequence="3">INDIVIDUAL MINDS AND THE MIND OF GOD. 11l comes out with peculiar clearness when applied to the case of pleasant or painful sensations-particularly painful ones. The only way in which I can argue in support of so obvious a proposition is either to show that those who appear to maintain it do not really or consistently maintain it; or that, in so far as they really do so, they involve themselves in inextricable difficulties, ambiguities, or contradictions. Now, in the first place, it is clear that the position which I am attacking is one which can only be held by those who really believe in a Universal Mind who is neither, on the one hand, (a) simply the sum or the system of individual minds, however much they may be looked upon as forming a system which is not a mere aggregate, however much you may insist upon the doctrine that the universal is more than the sum of its particulars; nor, on the other hand, (b) an Absolute which is really thought of not as mind at all but as an ultimate being in which all minds are included, and of which they constitute in some sense the attributes-an ultimate being in which all distinction between subject and object, mind and matter, is transcended and annihilated. It is, therefore, unnecessary to examine the position of Spinoza or of those Hegelians who approach the Spinozistic position. There is, I believe, something like a consensus among present- day philosophers that Spinoza did not believe in a Universal Mind, that his "God" is not the God of religion or of spiritualism or of idealism, but simply a name for nature or the universe, one attribute of which is that which reveals itself in the minds of finite spirits, but which has no existence outside those spirits. I strongly suspect that many Hegelians who use this language about an all-inclusive Absolute are in much the same position. How far this is true of Hegel himself, I will not undertake to say. Dr. McTaggart would, I believe, support me if I contended that that is Hegel's real meaning. There are others about whom no such doubt can be entertained, e.g., the late T. H. Green. Green undoubtedly</page><page sequence="4">112 HASTINGS RASHDALL. believed that God is a self-consciousness which is not merely the finite spirits taken together; but he was so vague about the relation between the universal self-consciousness and finite spirits, he tends so much vaguely to identify them without asking what kind of difference there is between them, that it is really impossible to subject his view to any clear analysis. Moreover, the tendency of Green and his school was to make the Universal Ego simply a thinker. Professor Hobhouse is quite justified in saying that it is difficult to discover what place he assigned to sensation in the formation of our knowledge, except that it is a contemptible one. But one thing is certain. Green would have been horrified at the idea of making the Absolute feel or experience a human tooth-ache. It may be doubted whether Green's Deity would even have been aware of so contemptible and "particular " an accident. Green can only make the Universal Mind all- inclusive by treating individual sensations as mere nothings. They are not outside God, because in point of fact they do not exist at all. They are in fact the Platonic lpI br. Green is not really an advocate of the thesis which I deny. Very different is the position of Mr. Bradley. Nothing can exceed the definiteness with which Mr. Bradley asserts that the experience of finite spirits is ultimately part of-or rather (since the word "part" implies relation and the relational form is the mark of unreality), absorbed in, an adjective of, an element in, a single relationless and all-inclusive experience. Moreover, in this experience these finite experiences are not merely absorbed; they are transmuted. When looked at from the point of view of the Absolute, in so far as they come into the Absolute experience, they lose all in them that is inharmonious, imperfect, evil. No previous writer had ever perhaps asserted with so much definiteness that each human tooth-ache enters into and forms part of the absolute experience. But we are further told that, though our pains enter into that experience, they do not enter into it as pains. The pain is transmuted</page><page sequence="5">INDIVIDUAL MINDS AND THE MIND OF GOD. 113 into, and becomes an element in, a whole which is not painful, as discords are said to be resolved in the symphony. Well now, if that is so, I submit that Mr. Bradley admits that pain as such does fall outside the Absolute experience. If God does not feel the pain as painful, He does not feel what I feel. And what I feel is something. To me this tooth-ache is painful: my pain has an existence, however imperfect, self-contradictory and generally contemptible an existence it may be. If, there- fore, there is no pain inside the Absolute experience, the pain- the painfulness of the pain-falls outside that experience. You may say what you like about the individual's experience, or the individual himself, not being ultimately real, about it and he being mere adjectives or the like. That does not affect the proposition that pains have their place in the universe- pains felt as pains. No account of the universe can express the whole truth about it which does not recognise that fact. If the absolute experience does not include that fact, then it is something which is outside the absolute experience, so long as you mean by the absolute experience the experience of a conscious mind. It is not outside the totality of things: it is not outside the Absolute, if you like to distinguish between the Absolute and the Universal Mind: but on Mr. Bradley's own showing, it is not an element in the Universal Mind, and yet he does not deny it some sort of existence. I have nothing to do with the ultimate metaphysical reality of finite minds and their contents. I am only attacking the psychological propo- sition that this moment's painful consciousness of mine can be regarded as being also at the same time the painful conscious- ness of a larger mind. And that is a proposition which Mr. Bradley does not assert. I have so far been criticizing Mr. Bradley upon the assump- tion that he really believes in a single conscious experience which is more than the combined (if you like), the absorbed, transmuted, harmonized, and (if I may so say) optimized expe- rience of all the finite minds taken together. But as we</page><page sequence="6">114 HASTINGS RASHDALL. proceed with Appearance and Reality, especially as we read it in the light of its author's later utterances, it becomes more and more doubtful whether he really does believe in any consciousness that is not simply the consciousnesses of men and animals looked at from some transcendental point of view in which the differences between them vanish, and they pass into mere elements in a whole. From this point of view the Absolute becomes a mere ideal of a possible experience, never actually realized-a logical implication of knowledge but an implication which involves the suicidal consequence that all knowledge is necessarily false. In so far as Mr. Bradley gives up thinking of the Absolute as a conscious experience, his position approximates to that of Spinoza, and he can still less be regarded as holding the thesis which I attack. For one who does not believe in a Universal Mind the problem does not exist. For Mr. Bradley as for Spinoza it may be true that the only real experience of my pain is as the adjective of the Absolute, but then that really existing Absolute is not a mind or a consciousness at all. I have not dealt with the question whether there is any real meaning in the language used by Mr. Bradley-and also by the eminent philosopher who is in the too modest habit of speaking of himself as a disciple of Mr. Bradley-about pains and other experiences being absorbed, harmonized, transmuted, and the like in the Absolute. The position of Mr. Bradley and Professor Bosanquet in this matter has never been so acutely criticized, its essential meaninglessness has never been so remorselessly exposed, as in Professor Pringle-Pattison's recent book, The Idea of God. On this head I can only humbly subscribe to all that he has said. And yet, after 'all, Professor Pringle-Pattison himself ends by maintaining verbally the same thesis of an inclusive Mind, inasmuch as he still persists in identifying God and the Absolute; and the Absolute is of course, for him as for every one who uses the term, all-inclusive. But in dealing with Professor Pringle-Pattison's position, I</page><page sequence="7">INDIVIDUAL MINDS AND THE MIND OF GOD. 115 shall venture to contend not merely (as with Mr. Bradley) that he ought logically to admit all that I am asserting, but that he does explicitly admit it, however inconsistent it may be with his other contentions. " It takes two not only to make a bargain: it takes two to love and to be loved, two to worship and to be worshipped, and many combined in a common purpose to form a society or a people." For Professor Pringle- Pattison as for me-God and man-God and any man-are two minds, though they are doubtless part of one universe or totality of being. I will not quote any more of the passages from his book which seem to me to contain an admission of all that I contend for, and will only refer to the still more explicit statements made in a reply which he did me the honour of making to my article in Mind upon his book. If ever controversy is justified it is when it leads to such explanation as that article contains: whether for explanation the word "recantation " might not be respectfully substituted, I will leave others to judge. "No mental experience of mine can, in the sense in which it is my experience, form part of the experience of any other mind. This is the formal distinction of selves which Professor Bosanquet so disparages, and which I have defended against him in a series of passages some of which Dr. Rashdall quotes. I reject the whole conception of the 'confluence' and over- lapping of selves as existents. A self may be largely identical in content with other selves, but to speak as if their common content affected in any way their existential distinctness is, I contend, to be the victim of a confusion. Uniqueness belongs to the very notion of a self or consciousness. No one ever can, literally or directly, see the world through my eyes. That being so, it follows-follows, I might say, ex vi termini -that it is meaningless, as Dr. Rashdall contends, to speak of one consciousness as 'included in another,' or to speak of 'a Mind which includes all minds,' and of man as, in that sense, 'a part of God.' What holds good as between finite conscious-</page><page sequence="8">116 HASTINGS RASHDALL. nesses would also be true of a divine experience, so far as that is conceived as a self-consciousness essentially similar in structure to our own." . . . . "So far, then, as we think of God simply as self-consciousness, this element of otherness must remain: the experiences of finite selves do not form part of the divine experience in the same sense in which they are the experiences of the selves in question." Save for the qualification contained in the last half-sentence, I want nothing more. I should have liked to add " or in any other sense." I would only submit that in the light of this explanation of his real meaning, there are a good many passages in Tike Idea of God which should be cancelled or re-written. These passages are, to say the truth, contained chiefly in his criticisms upon myself. After reading them, I feel that Professor Pringle-Pattison objects to my saying exactly what he says himself. As one so constantly finds in philosophical criticism, one man may steal the horse while another may not look over the fence. He objects to my talking of "separate and mutually exclusive centres of consciousness." But I have not called God and man "separate" or "mutually exclusive" in any sense in which the Professor has not so called them. When he goes on to accuse me of treating the universal as one of the particulars, he is simply falling back, as it seems to me, into that way of treating God as a mere abstract universal against which he has himself so energetically protested. And above all, as it seems to me, he fails altogether to give adequate reasons for that identification of God with the Absolute from which I dissent. What his defence seems to amount to is simply this; he admits that he uses the term God in two senses. He admits that God considered as consciousness does not exclude the finite centres of consciousness: but in view of the essen- tiality of God to the whole universe, in view of the identity of content between our minds and the divine mind, of the presence (in limited and imperfect degree) of the same ideals of truth, beauty and goodness which are of the essence of His</page><page sequence="9">INDIVIDUAL MINDS AND THE MIND OF GOD. 117 Being, he thinks himself entitled to use the word God also to denote that All outside of which there is nothing, and which philosophers have been in the habit of calling the Absolute. I submit that this usage is, to say the least of it, confusing. It savours a little too much of an attempt to keep on good terms with the religious world which thinks of God as a Self and with that philosophical world which will have no God but the Absolute. It would be better, if we must keep the word Absolute, to use the term God only for " God considered as a con- sciousness" and the term Absolute only for " God considered as all-inclusive." Nothing but a tradition of the schools prevents Professor Pringle-Pattison from recognizing frankly that God and the selves together make up one Absolute. On this particular point the difference between us is merely one of language. Whatever other differences there may be between Professor Pringle-Pattison's view of the universe and mine, they are irrelevant to the present issue. No doubt some of my hearers may be impatient at this criticism of a particular writer, for whom they are not responsible. I will defend myself in the language which Pro- fessor Hobhouse has used in reference to John Stuart Mill. "Mill," he says, "was guilty of shortcomings and incon- sistencies, like other philosophers, but the head and front of his offending was that, unlike many other philosphers, he wrote intelligibly enough to be found out." It is for that reason that I have taken Professor Pringle-Pattison as an illustration of the view which I am examining. But I believe that the same line of criticism could be adopted with every other writer who has used similar language--except, indeed, the mystics who frankly admit that reason is not adequate to the task of recon- ciling their contradictions, and that you have got to enter into some super-logical experience in which contradictions vanish. I admit that I cannot follow them into that region. There is only one other line of defence which is possible to him who undertakes to defend views which to him seem truths</page><page sequence="10">118 HASTINGS RASHDALL. against criticism of his opponent's and that is to show the source of the mistake which has been so widely made. No one has pointed out the mistake more clearly than Professor Pringle-Pattison; it consists in taking identity of content to be synonymous with identity of existence. In so far as I know what another person knows, it is assumed, I am identical with that other person. If, therefore, God knows all that I know, my being must be entirely compre- hended in His. Another way of putting the same point is to say that the mistake is due to the habit of assuming that the real being of a mind, its priwipium individuationis is, as may be the case with the being of a mere thing, constituted by what that mind is for another mind which knows it. It is, there- fore, argued that if per impossibile, two disembodied minds could have exactly the same experiences, they would be not two minds but one. I submit that there is nothing contra- dictory or inconceivable in the supposition that there might be two minds whose content was exactly the same; and yet they would be two and not one; although, so far as all that a third person knew about them goes, there would be no means of dis- tinguishing between them. All that the third person could know would be that there was such a content in and for two minds. The essence of a mind is what it is for itself, not what it is for an other. The essence of a mind is not to be known but to know, to will, to feel-in a word, to be conscious. The individual mind itself would have no difficulty in distinguishing itself from the other mind which repeated its experiences; it might know that there was another such mind in the world, but it would not have the least difficulty in distinguishing itself from that other or any number of such others. Consciousness is not the same thing as thought about consciousness. The absurdity of the contrary supposition may be illustrated by supposing two minds with a content partially the same- thinking (to some extent) the same things, willing the same things, feeling the same things. In a certain sense, it is true</page><page sequence="11">INDIVIDUAL MINDS AND THE MIND OF GOD. 119 to say that, so far as the contents of the two minds are alike, they are the same; though it will hardly be denied that after all it remains true that, even in respect of this identical content, there is also a difference, since the identical content is experienced twice over. All similarity is identity and difference; and so long as there is that consciousness of the same twice over, there is difference as well as identity. Now let us suppose that these two consciousnesses were to become more and more alike, i.e., that the identity becomes greater and greater, the difference less and less. If there is any difficulty in supposing, even with the per impossibile, that increase of experience should involve decrease of individuality, we may suppose that the identity is secured by a gradual deterioration, including complete forgetfulness of their own differing past. It is admitted that, so long as any difference in content at all remained, we might still speak of two minds, two knowing experiences or two pains. But now let us suppose that the difference in content disappears altogether; it would follow according to the contention, that they would suddenly cease to be two minds and collapse into one. Surely that inference constitutes a reductio ad absurdunm. Up to the moment of complete identity of content there are two consciousnesses of the common content: why should that twoness disappear because the content becomes absolutely identical ? There is one possible line of reply on which I must say a word. The champion of the all-inclusive mind may fall back upon this line of argument: " All you say may be true so long as you look at things from the temporal point of view. So long as you mean by minds so many streams of consciousness in time, it is true that these must be regarded as numerically different from one another, and they would be different from the divine mind also if that mind were simply another succession of conscious states. But these streams of temporal consciousness are not the reality: nor do they, as such, even make parts of the reality. The Absolute Mind is super-temporal; and from the timeless</page><page sequence="12">120 HASTINGS RASHDALL. point of view, streams of consciousness become nothing and are reduced to an aspect of a changeless, eternal mind. Just as the mutual exclusiveness of successive moments of conscious- ness is from the absolute point of view a mere illusion, so the numerical identity and distinguishableness of contemporary streams of consciousness is a mere delusion, which disappears when looked at from the absolute point of view." To this line of thought I should reply: (1) I do not admit that from any possible point of view, the successive moments of consciousness can be reduced to mere aspects or adjectives of a reality which is timeless. One unintelligibility is not made more intelligible by comparing it to another unintelligibility. And (2) even if you could treat time as unreal or (with Green) regard the individual ego as timeless, I do not see that that in the least reduces the difficulty of identifying two conscious selves with one another. I recognise the difficulty of regarding our temporal point of view as the only and ultimately truthful point of view. I do not believe that the old Kantian antinomy has ever been transcended. But, whatever be the true way of bridging it, it cannot be bridged by the simple denial of the validity of time-distinctions. To think of God as a time- occupying consciousness like ours-persisting through a succes- sion of moments or rather a continuum of experience-may be, and doubtless is, an inadequate way of thinking; but it is at least more adequate than to talk about Him as timeless. For our knowledge nothing can be timeless except truth. Very largely, I believe, the notion of the All-inclusive Mind arises from the same mistake as the notion of a timeless Absolute. Both arise from the confusion of content with existence. Existence, of course, cannot be abstracted from content, but neither can content be abstracted from existence. Or rather it can be abstracted in thought, but such an abstraction is not reality. To think of the Absolute Mind as timeless is to confuse abstract truth or knowledge with the mind that knows. Truth, of course, is timeless; but truth is not reality. There</page><page sequence="13">INDIVIDUAL MINDS AND THE MIND OF GOD. 121 must be some way of getting over the antinomy involved in our thought of time; but nothing can be gained by using meaning- less language about a timeless mind or self. We do not under- stand time, if I may borrow an expression of Professor Stout's, but we shall not understand it any the better by talking nonsense about it. And even if we do attempt to think of a mind or an experience that is timeless, the relations between such a timeless experience and our essentially temporal experience would remain as unintelligible as ever. The notion of a mind which eternally or extra-temporally swallows up experiences which, as actually experienced, are unique and individual, involves the reduction of the facts of consciousness to mere appearances, and in the end to delusive appearances. It involves the line of thought which many have attempted to follow, but which hardly any Western philosopher has followed out to its logical consequences except Mr. Bradley. And when Mr. Bradley after all admits that the Absolute exists only in its appearances, he is really admitting that the Absolute is after all only an ideal of a possible and yet intrinsically unattainable knowledge--not a self or a mind which includes other minds. In an ideal of conceivable knowledge, a know- ledge which passes beyond knowledge into reality, the experiences of many selves may no doubt find a place. But they are no longer the actual experiences of the finite selves. Considered as experiences of finite selves, they are indeed from that point of view appearances; but it is to these experiences that my thesis relates. Once again, the problem is a problem of psychology rather than of metaphysic, though I should hasten to add that a sane metaphysic must not con- tradict sane psychology. Before I conclude, I should like to return once more for a moment to Professor Pringle-Pattison's criticisms upon myself. His reply to me makes it plain that he did not object to my language about the relation of God to the human mind because of my denial of the all-inclusive notion of God, but K</page><page sequence="14">122 HASTINGS RASHDALL. because of certain other views of mine as to the relation between God and Man. In particular, my language seemed to him to exaggerate the analogy between God and the finite self-to treat God too much as if He were merely another self, only more knowing, more powerful than other selves. In fact his criticism amounts simply to the old cry of anthropo- morphism which is always raised when a philosopher attempts to take theism seriously. I submit that Professor Pringle- Pattison has gone much too far in this direction himself to be entitled to throw that stone at me. I agree with him that our only possible knowledge of the ultimate nature of reality is to be derived from our knowledge of the human mind at its highest. But I should admit fully the inadequacy of such knowledge. I should be quite ready with the schoolmen to say that all our language about God must be understood sensu eminentiori, a much more reasonable creed than a monism of the pantheistic type. I submit that, when it is admitted that our ideas about ultimate reality are inadequate, it is impossible for us to show in detail wherein the inadequacy consists. A theistic view of the universe must admit a large background of agnosticism: but it is, I submit, illogical first to use such language as mind, self-consciousness, person, and then to be continually shouting " anthropomorphism " whenever one encounters some obvious implication of these terms. We must of course deny to God characteristics of mentality, consciousness, personality which are obviously inconsistent with the idea of a mind which is to be regarded as " somehow" -here I purposely avoid using more definite language which may be disputed-the ground of all reality, particularly those features of some human minds which are absent, absolutely or relatively, in the highest human minds. We must deny to Him the limitations which are intrinsically inconsistent with the very idea of a universal knowing or willing. Yet we must not deny to Him the characteristics which belong to the nature of mind or consciousness as such. To be unique is a charac-</page><page sequence="15">INDIVIDUAL MINDS AND THE MIND OF GOD. 123 teristic of the highest as of the lowest consciousness. My submission is that, if and so far as we are going to recognize as the ultimate ground of things a mind greater than any mind we know, the otherness of that mind to all other minds must be accepted as a consequence of our hypothesis. That otherness belongs not to the limitations of consciousness but to its "esse." The hypothesis of a mind which altogether and completely overcomes and annihilates this otherness is one which there is nothing in our human experience to suggest, to justify, or even to make intelligible. It constitutes all that we mean by calling it mind. Certainly every mind---divine or human-must be thought of as a part of a whole which includes all minds and the world which all minds know. Certainly these minds must form a unity, and for those who include in these minds a mind which can be entitled to the name of God, the superiority and the all-pervasiveness of this mind cannot be too strongly asserted. The minds must form a unity; but that unity is not the particular sort of unity which belongs to self-consciousness. The Absolute certainly- if you must indulge in that "blessed word "-includes other minds; God, if He is a Mind, does not. K2</page><page sequence="16">124 J. H. MUIRHEAD. II. By J. H. MUIRHEAD. DEAN RASHDALL complains that owing to the order of these papers he has lost the advantage of position. Instead of leading a brilliant offensive, as he is so well capable of doing, he has had to dig himself in in a defensive of negation and await the attacli of others. After hearing his paper, we shall agree that he has executed this movement with his usual ingenuity and thoroughness and succeeded in fortifying himself with bristling lines of wire entanglements; but I wish to add at once without, as it seems to me, his usual caution. Granted that by inclusion is meant the destruc'tion of separate existence, it is easy to show that it is a contradiction in terms to speak of minds or indeed of anything as included in anything else. But when this position is at once extended, as it is by Dean Rashdall, into the denial that there is any sense in which a mind can be said to form a whole with another mind, the line of his trench seems to me lamentably inadequate to the ground it seeks to defend. In other words he has proved too much. One might have thought that the instance with which he himself starts "every moment of consciousness is unique," would have been sufficient warning against this mistake. What, we might ask, of the separate moments of an individual mind? It is quite true that there is a sense in which every moment is unique, but it is a uniqueness which not only falls within the whole of the continuous life of the individual but which derives its character of uniqueness from its relation to that whole. If this criticism be valid my dissent (it will be seen) from Dean Rashdall consists not in denying that he has made good his contention with regard to a particular interpretation of the relation of inclusion, but that he has failed to realise that the matter cannot end there. There are interests involved which he would be the last to deny and which make it necessary to go</page><page sequence="17">INDIVIDUAL MINDS AND THE MIND OF GOD. 125 beyond a blank negative and to inquire whether there may not be a sense in which, while safeguarding the valuable element in the independence for which he stands, we may yet support the affirmative thesis. I agree with Dean Rashdall that it might have been well to have had the sense in which any of the symposiasts is prepared to do this clearly stated at the outset. I am not any more than Dr. Rashdall in the secrets of those who are responsible for the conundrum which stands at the head of this Symposium. But if I might surmise what they had in mind, it would seem to me somewhat as follows. (The members will forgive me if I seem to be recalling ancient and familiar history):- Since the publication of Appearance and Reality in 1893, and more particularly since the brilliant anti-theistic applica- tion of its principles to the solution of the problems of Indi- viduality and of Individual Value and Destiny by Mr. Bosanquet in the sphere of religion, we have had within the precincts of what is still perhaps best described as Objective Idealism, a remarkable reaction in favour of a form of doctrine, which, while avoiding the error of an unmitigated pluralism of finite and infinite mind, shall yet preserve the essentials of self-hood to both. It would be invidious to single out names, but the writers who have taken this line, with whom I happen to be most familiar, are Professors Sorley and A. E. Taylor, Mr. Clement Webb, and Professor Pringle-Pattison. I wish to say at once how deeply I sympathize with this movement. I have always thought that the Hegelian doctrine of "Aufhebung " in being translated into the Bradleyan "transcendence " and "transformation" has been in danger of losing an essential part of its original truth. I think it is William Wallace who reminds us that Aufheben, like the Scotch "put by " or "put past," has a double significance. The thing is not merely put aside or relegated to the past, but held over and carried on into the future. The emphasis which modern idealist writers (mainly, I think, English) have put</page><page sequence="18">126 J. H. MUIRHEAD. upon the first part of the meaning has thrown the second into the background-and gone far to obliterate it altogether. It is not denied that in the transition from the lower to the higher category, e.g., from mechanism to life and from life to con- sciousness, the lower, with all the transformation which it suffers, remains a recognizable element. It is only when it comes to a question of the limits of our ordinary self-con- sciousness, whether in the life of will, of knowledge, or of feeling, that it is thought necessary to suggest that, in transcending these limits, the focalization which is the essence of self-consciousness must disappear in a form of experience admittedly unintelligible, and only by courtesy describable as experience at all. It is not necessary to maintain that the highest and most real form of experience is merely an enlarged replica of our finite and recognizably imperfect self-conscious- ness. What it does seem necessary to maintain is that the focalisation to which the universe attains in self-conscious minds remains the essential form of its highest manifestations. Instead of conceiving of it as an Aufgehobener Standpunkt in the ordinary sense of the word, might it not be truer to conceive of it as intensified, and at the same time solidified in the wider, more comprehensive, and harmonized experience which these writers mean by the Absolute ? Be this as it may, in such a reading of the ultimate reality, the necessity of denying mind in any intelligible sense to the Absolute, and therewith of making a distinction between the God of religion and the Absolute or Eternal of philosophy seems to be removed. But it is idle to deny that these advantages are purchased at a great price, or that the new theism brings its own problems with it. With the interpretation of the whole or the Absolute as mind comes, in a new form, the question of its relation to the individual selves of our ordinary experience. That in some sense the Absolute must include the relative, the intinite the finite, seems to be demanded not only of the theoretic,</page><page sequence="19">INDIVIDUAL MINDS AND THE MIND OF GOD. 127 but of the religious consciousness.* Yet it would seem to be just this relation of reciprocal inclusion that the argument which has brought us so far seems to render difficult to conceive. We may, indeed, having arrived at this point, take refuge in ignorance, and renounce all attempts at a solution as in its nature self-contradictory. This seems the position taken up by Professor Pringle-Pattison in his Gifford Lectures on the Idea of God.f But that his critics are dissatisfied with this reply is proved, if by nothing else, by our assembly here. Had I myself been satisfied with this result, I should, I suppose, not have accepted the invitation to take a leading part in the discussion. As it is, and in view of the admiration I have always felt for the author's wise philosophic caution, I recog- nize the risk I run in stepping in where he has feared to tread. I only do it in the conviction that, unless we can succeed in making the relation between the finite and the infinite spirit at least more intelligible than it is here left, we risk losing all that he and others have contended for. What I propose to do is (1) very shortly to review the analogies that have actually been suggested by different writers. (2) In so far as any of them seems bound to inquire whether * There are perhaps no religious phrases that have been more powerful and universal in their appeal than that which claims for the saint a life that is hid with Christ in God (Col. iii, 3), and that other which describes the ideal Christian experience, " I in them and Thou in me that they may be perfected in one" (St. John's Gospel xvii, 23; cf. xv, 4, 6). + " It is in the very nature of the case impossible that we should understand the relation (if one may even use such a finite term as relation) between a creative Spirit and its creatures, whether as regards the independence conferred or the mode in which the life-history of the finite being still remains part of the infinite experience. Finite beings know one another from the outside, as it were, the knower being ipso facto excluded from the immediate experience of other centres. But there can be no such barrier, we may suppose, between the finite consciousness and the Being in which its existence is rooted. It must remain open and accessible-it must enter into the divine experience in a way for which our mode of knowing hardly furnishes us with an analogy." (See the whole passage, op. cit., p. 293.)</page><page sequence="20">128 J. H. MUIRHEAD. the relation so conceived can be properly described as one of inclusion. There are three ways in which the attempt has been made by different writers to make the relation between the infinite and the finite mind intelligible. (1) There is in the first place what might be called the aesthetic analogy. The relation of the divine to the human mind has been compared to the relation of the dramatist to the characters in his work. I need not enlarge on the suggestion. Many probably besides Mr. Webb (God and Personality, pp. 126, 127) have felt its attraction, but I do not suppose it has satisfied any of us either from the philosophical or the religious point of view, and it is important before leaving it to realise wherein its unsatisfactoriness consists. It is not, I take it, that the characters have not a certain individuality and independence of their own. That is just what they have. R. L. Stevenson used to say that he did not make his characters do this or that: he merely watched them doing it. Nor is it, I think, that the existence of the characters depends on the author's or the reader's thinking of them, as the dead in the Blue Bird come in and out of existence as they are remembered or forgotten by the living. On any theory of a sustaining deity the finite must be conceived of as not only called into existence but preserved in existence by a mind that neither slumbers nor sleeps, neither forgets nor has to recall. The objection is that the characters receive the life and individuality, which they seem to, and really do possess independently of their creator, from their being conceived consistently with the laws of a real world, on which like their creator himself they depend. It is the nature of this primary dependence of both on a real universe that we are seeking to make intelligible to ourselves; and it is just this upon which the secondary dependence of created on creator in art fails to throw light. 2. Others have sought in the facts of divided personality and the relation of the subordinate to the principal personality</page><page sequence="21">INDIVIDUAL MINDS AND THE MIND OF GOD. 129 a clue to the relation we are considering (see e.g. A. E. Taylor, Proc. Arist. Soc., IX, 206, 214). As contrasted with oestheti- cally imagined, these subordinate psychic personalities are at any rate existing entities. They are moreover sub- stantial in a sense that makes it impossible to treat them as mere predicates of the principal or normal personality. A further advantage is the warning the recognition of the facts conveys against the dogmatism which assumes that in "personality " we have a crisp, easily definable idea and denies the possibility of overlapping and interpenetrating personalities. Lastly, the analogy seems to make comprehensible to us how, what in the divided personality has taken up an independent place in time as a real psychical entity-a "centre," or as I should prefer to say a nucleus of conscious experience, may gain in value by having to resign its separate existence and take its place as a subordinate element in a larger life. But it is just here that the analogy would seem to break down for the purpose of this paper. For in the first place the union is effected by a process of merging of the subordinate personality in the dominant, rather than a reformation of its contents within the form of a separate experience; and in the second place the change takes place by a process which, coming as we must assume it does from some change in the nervous conditions, if the subordinate personality could reflect upon it, would appear to it as something magical and coming from without (as in the case of Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde, or' the Bishop in Mr. H. G. Wells's Soul of a Bishop), instead of by a spiritual process of self-transcendence. What is absent in such cases is any fundamental unity of purpose with the normal personality, whether explicit or implicit; and to those of us who hold, with Dante, that the key to the relation of the finite to the infinite mind must be sought for in the possibility of a real unity of will and purpose, no analogy which ignores this can be of any real assistance. 3. It is just herein that the value of the third analogy to</page><page sequence="22">130 J. H. MUIRHEAD. which appeal has been made, that of the relation between the general and the individual will in society, consists. Admitting the reality of a general will in the sense not merely of a common element or abstract universal but of a dominating purpose which gives meaning to particular purposes, we can see how self-trans- cendence so far from meaning a sacrifice of individuality is the only way to realise it. The will that is one with the will of the whole is more of a will, the person who accepts the common good as his own is more of a person, than the will and the person that is still enslaved to some partial exclusive good. Since writing this paper I have read Sir Henry Jones's Principles of Citizenship, in which in Chapters III and IV this point is driven powerfully home. The point at which the analogy falls under suspicion for our present purpose is where it seems to strain the legal notion of corporate personality to cover the real separate existence implied in the full-bodied idea. To establish the analogy it seems as though we should have to fall back on a mysticism such as that which, at a certain stage in his mental development, attracted John Henry Newman, and which assigned their own angels to all forms of corporate life (Apologia pro Vita Sua, pp. 28, 29). If this, as we shall probably agree, is untenable, we seem to be shut up to Professor Pringle-Pattison's despairing conclusion. A question of this magnitude can obviously only be dealt with in the most cursory way in the space I have at my disposal. I must content myself with a bare hint of the line on which it still seems to me possible to find a more promising answer, and of the reason why Professor Pringle-Pattison and other writers who agree with him have refused to adopt it. So long as we approach the question, so to speak, from below, that is from the point of view of the life in time of finite persons, forming themselves, in circumstances largely accidental, into communities, we shall find it difficult to see ground for any mind and will over and above their own. But that is only one and a very partial point of view. Philosophy demands</page><page sequence="23">INDIVIDUAL MINDS AND THE MIND OF GOD. 131 that we look at the matter of our world sub specie eternitatis: from the point of view of the principle, good, or purpose which is operative in the creative, preservative, and progressive im- provement of terrestrial societies. From this point of view without cancelling in Spinoza's manner the substantial reality of the finite we can see how the purpose that the com- munity embodies must be conceived of as living elsewhere than in the finite minds and wills which seek to give expression to it, seeing that it is from it they draw such substantiality and permanence as they possess. This being granted, we are strongly tempted to make a leap, seeing that from the idea of purpose to a "spiritual principle," and from a spiritual principle to a mind seems but a step. We think in this connexion of Green, whom in the article referred to, Professor Taylor seems to follow. But since Green's time the study of the teleological element in subhuman nature and the subconscious in man has brought home to us what, in Spinoza's phrase, " the body can do of itself," and we have to walk warily. Yet we may find the path is open still. What the " body" and its achievements force us to admit is the necessity of the hypothesis of latent purpose, as in physics we have to make the assumption of latent energy. But the physical analogy warns us of the limits of the validity of the concept. As we can only really conceive of latent energy as suspended kinetic energy, so we can only conceive of latent purpose as conscious purpose suspended in a medium of the unconscious. If we are serious with " body," a " bodily purpose " is as much a con- tradiction in terms as an " inert energy." It is for this reason that while I am unwilling to commit myself to the finality of the conception of purpose as we understand it, I yet hold that at the level at which we find it forced upon us we are free to assert that it brings with it and justifies the interpretation of the world, not only (in Schopenhauer's sense of the words) as will and idea but as mind. It is doubtless a difficulty that mind as we know it, whatever it may become through the</page><page sequence="24">132 J. H. MUIRHEAD. extension of its content, takes its starting point from a unique complex of organic feeling. This is a difficulty that attaches to any form of theism, but it can only seem formidable to one who fails to realise that such unique feeling is only the starting point, the mere &amp;8vapCt and not the essence or evepyeeta of individuality, and that it is mere dogmatism tc assert that the one condition of such a nucleus is the con- stellation of nervous elements we are familiar with in our own bodies. If this contention is valid, it seems to me to provide us with a point of view from which it is possible to see beyond the blank negative with which Dean Rashdall meets the question before us. Accepting the reality, and even, in the sense explained, the ultimate reality of selfhood, we may admit at once that there can be no inclusion of the human in the Divine mind, which implies the merging of one in the other. But to admit this is one thing, to deny that minds can enter into organic relations with one another in any way that justifies us in speaking of them as whole and part is quite another. There would surely be something paradoxical, except on the assumption of the hardest-shelled individualism, in admitting a relation of inclusion in this sense of lower forms of reality, e.g., the chapters of a book or the members of a physical organism, and denying it of the highest. It is hardly necessary to traverse Dean Rashdall's examples to perceive their irrelevance to such a conception. We may be willing to recognise the truth of his contention with regard to pain and sensation, and yet maintain that even here there is a very real sense in which the same pain may be felt by two individuals. I am not thinking of Plato's pain in the finger, which is also a pain in the whole organism. Dean Rashdall would meet this by the denial of a separate mind in the finger. I would merely insist on the fact that uniqueness of sensory experience does not exclude, but is the condition of what we might call a sympathetic whole. It is not, however, on the possibility</page><page sequence="25">INDIVIDUAL MINDS AND THE MIND OF GOD. 133 of sharing these particular moments of experience that the case rests; but on the unity which is effected by that kind of sharing which is only possible to minds-the sharing of a common meaning. It is in the universal which is implicit in every particular human experience that minds meet and inter- penetrate; and, granted there is a mind in whose experience the paitially discerned meanings of our world form a harmonious whole, the quality of inclusiveness is not strained in being applied to such a relation. It is this application that finds support in our third analogy. A purpose is a universal. It is a meaning or direction given to particular actions. The actions, if you will, belong to the individuals, and cannot without contradiction belong, in the same sense, to another individual. But their purposes, in so far as they are harmonised, are included in the organic system of purposes which we have agreed can only be real in so far as they are the purposes of a universal mind. I shall be told, of course, that I am playing fast and loose with the ambiguity of mind. In such phrases as " let this mind be in you," etc., or again, when " our wills are ours to make them Thine," all that is meant is that we may share a content without ceasing to have our own minds and wills. But it is just the impossibility (adimitted by both Professor Pringle-Pattison and Dean Rashdall) of separating existence from content that makes it legitimate to insist that the real unity of content must be conceived of as penetrating the existence of the separate wills and legiti- mising language which, if unfamiliar to common sense, is at least natural to the deeper forms of religious experience. I do not claim that this attempt to justify the language of religion disposes of the manifold difficulties that surround the attempt to identify the Supreme Will of religious experience with the philosopher's Absolute. It is addressed to the single point of the legitimacy of expressing the relation of the Supreme Mind, in which the meanings and purposes of finite minds must be conceived of as in some sense fulfilled, as one of</page><page sequence="26">134 J. H. MUIRHEAD. inclusion. My contention is that Professor Pringle-Pattison and those who agree with him have been too modest and exposed themselves unnecessarily to criticism such as that which Dean Rashdall has not been slow to bring against them, in admitting that such a relation goes beyond all analogies of experience. They would, I believe, have done better to have had the courage of their conviction and supported their theistic conclusion by claiming the power of self-inclusion in the life of the whole through unity of purpose, as of the very essence of spirit.</page><page sequence="27">INDIVIDUAL MINDS AND THE MIND OF GOD. 135 III. By F. C. S. SCHILLER. THE truthseeker's safest and best method of approaching any philosophic question is assuredly to begin by asking what it means, in order that he may not be enmeshed in ambiguities and beguiled into investigating something that is intrinsically void of meaning; but when I remember the severe rebuke administered to Professor Alexander and myself at our last annual gathering for presuming to 'quarrel with our question,' I realize that even as the Kingdom of God can be entered only by little children, so admission to the sublime realm of metaphysics must be sought in the spirit of a schoolboy, who knows that he will get bad marks if he does not answer his questions as he is expected to do by those who set them. And yet presumably a schoolboy is (or ought to be) also a learner, and it seems to me that we all have much to learn in metaphysics. Now, we refuse to assume the learner's attitude when we assume that the problems of metaphysics have already been so completely explored that there can be a question only of determining which of the catalogued varieties is the true and final metaphysic. We refuse to assume the learner's attitude when we assume that the terms in which we put our questions are all clear, definite, and unambiguous, and so that our questions have a meaning and are susceptible of an answer. We refuse even to put ourselves into a posture in which learning is possible when we refuse to discuss with those who are raising a question what meanings they attach to its terms, and are content to proceed at cross purposes to crooked answers. To me it seems that this whole procedure should be reversed, if a discussion is to be profitable. Disputants should first of all be invited to come to terms, and to understand each other. After that it may be possible to formulate questions that have a determinate meaning and admit of a definite answer. After that, again, it may be possible</page><page sequence="28">136 F. C. S. SCHILLER. to enunciate a number of answers, and to determine which of them is the best. Until we do this, the terms of metaphysics will remain as obscure, the questions as ambiguous, the answers as vague and meaningless, and their discussion as unsatisfactory, as they are at present. At the same time I must joyfully admit that the present discussion is in a large measure exceptional. The credit for this is primarily due to the Dean of Carlisle. Rivalling another famous Dean in his outspokenness, he has cleared away an enormous amount of philosophic fog, and traced it to its sources. I entirely agree with him that on the assumptions of common- sense one mind does not include another and that the terms of our question are, humanly speaking, nonsense. I entirely agree with him that the arguments for philosophic Absolutism are vitiated by the most tantalising vagueness and are devoid of all logical cogency. I am full of admiration for his candour, courage, and clearness, and of approval of his contentions, though I should hardly have ventured to indicate so bluntly that the whole mass of problems about the 'mind' of the Absolute has been generated by attempts on the part of philo- sophers to run with the hare and to hunt with the hounds, " to keep on good terms with the religious world which thinks of God as a Self and with that philosophical world which will have no God but the Absolute." This cap undoubtedly fits a great many philosophers, and it has ever been a cap of darkness. Nevertheless, these philosophers are not alone to blame. The religious world has played straight into their hands, when they endeavoured to confuse the values of terms by affixing a religious label to the Absolute, which is properly speaking nothing but a technical term for the Whole. For the religious world had always exhibited a curious preference for leaving the meaning of certain terms vague and indeterminate, and even logically self-contradictory. This phenomenon is much too general and persistent to be ascribed to accident, and is maintained with far too much ingenuity to be set down to stupidity. It may be</page><page sequence="29">INDIVIDUAL MINDS AND THE MIND OF GOD. 137 suggested, therefore, that it is not really the intellectual defect it seems to be. The apparent intellectual defect may be only religious camouflage, only the paradoxical expression of a profound religious craving, which is not intellectual in its nature. It is easily traced to its real source when we consent to consider the psychology of religion. When we realise that religious conceptions are, in general, more or less disguised postulates, it becomes intelligible why some of them can only perform their religious functions by being left vague, and others by combining incompatible postulates in a manner that is logically indefensible but psychologically imperative. As an example of the former type we may adduce the belief in 'Heaven,' as one of the latter, that in 'God.' The religious conception of Heaven is left vague, partly because it is not easy to think it out in a manner wholly satisfactory to all the instincts that call for it, partly because serious and detailed concern with it would involve thoughts of death, from which the religious mind shrinks as much as the secular. Conse- quently a blank denial of immortality is not more shocking to the religious mind than a matter-of-fact elaboration of the idea, such as is not infrequently put forward by the spiritists. Similarly the religious sentiment does plainly postulate a 'God' who is both benevolent and omnipotent, though a child can see that these two postulates are logically incompatible. But it is felt that unless 'God' is benevolent, he will not be willing, unless he is omnipotent he may not be able, to grant his worshippers all that they desire. For they desire so much! So they demand benevolence and omnipotence. The logical incongruity does not matter psychologically; for the two demands are not made simultaneously or in the context of the same train of thought. Theology, of course, merely takes over, and formulates in technical language, these peremptory demands of the religious sentiment. We must recognise then the existence of conceptions which are essentially self-contradictory, and the religious demand that L</page><page sequence="30">138 F. C. S. SCHILLER. every soul shall be itself, and responsible for itself, and that yet God shall be " all in all," and all-inclusive, may be one of them. Moreover, self-contradictory conceptions do not occur only in religion. Where would our sciences be if they had to abjure the use of fictions?. The more ancient and respectable they are, the more prone are they to postulate the impossible and contradictory. The mathematician thinks nothing of inventing a symbol for an impossible operation, like V/-1, or a locus for pooling his contradictions, like 'infinity'; and when he has done so, troubles himself no further with any logical protests. It has to be recognised also that self-contradictions are normal incidents in the development of scientific notions. For such notions have continually to assimilate new discoveries, which are often of considerable magnitude. They can do so only by continually transforming themselves and disavowing a past which nevertheless clings to their formulation. They are required to be elastic, and the process of stretching the old meaning over the new facts often puts an intolerable strain upon it. The new as it accrues always conflicts with the old, and ultimately contradicts it outright. But this does not matter scientifically. No one thinks the worse of an 'atom' because it has become a divisible 'indivisible.' If a scientist stopped to notice such an incongruity, he would only pooh-pooh it as a passing phase in the growth of his science. This is doubtless true of the particular instance, but does not alter the fact that there are always some conceptions which are in this self-con- tradictory condition. Now the religious conceptions are so very instructive because they are so poignantly and permanently self-contradictory; they thereby yield a precious indication of the true nature of human conceptions. For when they are adequately probed, they never turn out to be the merely intellectual affairs they are superficially supposed to be; they can always be traced to a source in the aims and demands of our whole nature. They</page><page sequence="31">INDIVIDUAL MINDS AND THE MIND OF GOD. 139 formulate a human interest taken in the objects they refer to, and when this interest is cleft by conflicts and divided against itself, the conceptions which reflect it naturally become 'self- contradictory.' Hence, even when to a rationalistic logic they are foolishness, they can still be vehicles of a deep spiritual significance. I must conclude, therefore, that the confusion of God with the Absolute is not entirely due to the dishonesty of philosophers. Nor am I entirely satisfied that the common-sense objection to including one mind in another is quite conclusive. It is, of course, roughly, borne out by the facts and by the notions we have framed on the basis of ordinary experience. But have we considered all the facts and framed notions which are adequate to deal with all of them ? Until we can feel sure of this, it is hardly wise to deny dogmatically that one 'mind' (with a definition yet to be completed) can ' include' (in a sense as yet elastic) another (to an extent not yet determined). We have surely still far too much to learn about 'minds' and their construction, operation, and powers, to dogmatise thus. We do not know as yet where the limits of 'mind' are set in nature, nor do we know exhaustively what powers and means a particular mind may have of influencing another. What if there occur 'telepathic' transfer of contents from one mind to another ? There is a respectable body of evidence that goes to show that this does occur. It has even suggested to so great a psychologist as William James the possibilities that minds may be subliminally in communication with each other, and even that individual minds may be separate only as a sub- merged mountain range may appear as a chain of islands above the surface of the sea. Now it is true that ' telepathic' is only a word that conveys no explanation of its modus operandi, and that the suggested universal 'reservoir,' in which all the individual streams of consciousness are to be pooled, is only a problem; but any success in using either notion might pro- foundly transform our present conception of ' mind.' Whether L2</page><page sequence="32">140 F. C. S. SCHILLER. we should be willing to call such a universal mind' divine' would be a further question. To dub it 'God' would merely be to express faith in its positive value; but it might well prove to be the very devil. Without going all these lengths, which will strike many as fantastic, and should only be entertained hypothetically, we may find ourselves seriously summoned to take account of empirical evidence which appears to illustrate quite definitely the inclu- sion of one mind by another, and to throw much light upon the process. "I refer, of course, to some of the incidents in the 'dissociations' of personality, of which many cases have now been fully studied and recorded,* and to which I am glad to see Professor Muirhead also has referred. From these records we may gather, not only a definite idea of what is meant in the concrete by the including of one mind in another, but also abundant illustration of the varieties, degrees, operation, and consequences of this remarkable relation. Thus we find that 'Sally Beauchamp' had direct, immediate access to all that 'B. I' did, felt and thought, without in the least identifying herself with 'B. I' or confusing her experiences with her own. To 'B. IV' her relation was different; she was aware of what ' B. IV' did, felt and dreamt, but not what she thought, a fact which sometimes enabled the subtler mind of 'B. IV' to deceive 'Sally,' and to get the better of her. Moreover, these relations were not reciprocal, but were what is now called 'asymmetrical'; for both ' B. I' and ' B. IV,' the existence of 'Sally,' was inferential. In the ' Doris Fischer' case, at one time, the relations were still more complicated. (1) The primary personality, 'Real Doris,' who had suffered dissociation at the early age of three, had no direct cognizance of any of her asso- ciates, though thoughts of 'Margaret' might ' bubble up' into * Cf. particularly, Sidis and Goodhart, Multiple Personality, Morton Prince, The Dissociation of a Personality, and W. F. Prince, The Case of Doris Fischer (in Vols. IX, X, XI of the Proceedings of the American Society for Psychical Research).</page><page sequence="33">INDIVIDUAL MINDS AND THE MIND OF GOD. 141 her mind. (2) 'Sick Doris' knew (or could know) all that entered the mind of 'Real Doris,' but had no access to the mind of (3) 'Margaret' (the equivalent of 'Sally' in the Beauchamp Case), who had full access to the minds of ' R.D.' and of ' S.D.' The most inclusive 'mind,' however, was that of (4) 'Sleeping Margaret,' who saw 'Margaret's' thoughts directly, those of ' S.D.' reflected via 'Margaret,' and those of 'R.D.' reflected from ' S.D.' via 'Margaret.'* It would seem then that under these peculiar conditions of 'dissociation' one mind can include others. But this capacity does not guarantee to it any other superiority, nor tend as such to edification. The more inclusive mind does not thereby become the higher or better or wiser mind. Neither does it ex officio love the minds it includes. Both ' Sally' and 'Mar- garet' were distinctly childish minds that did not, and could not, understand the higher qualities of ' B. I' and 'Real Doris.' So far from loving, 'Sally' detested ' B. IV,' despised' B. I,' and found her chief delight in tormenting both. Similarly, 'Mar- garet,' though at first she devoted herself to the instruction of 'Sick Doris' and to the concealment of her total ignorance of the life into which she had suddenly been launched at the age of 17, soon quarrelled with her, and treated her little better than ' Sally' did 'B. I.' It is true that ' Margaret' did not hate 'Real Doris,' and that the two halves of the ' Rev. Mr. Hanna' (before the fall and after) ardently desired to be re-united; but on the whole the indications are that when a mind 'dissociates' the resultant personalities will be on bad terms both with each other and with their including mind. Which no doubt would explain the state of the world on the theory that we are all 'dissociations' of the Absolute, but is not otherwise a particu- larly cheerful or elevating doctrine. Mention must finally be made of the most normal and common, though least sensational, case of the inclusion of one * Cf. my review of this case in Proc. S. P. R., Pt. 74, p. 389.</page><page sequence="34">142 F. C. S. SCHILLER. mind by another; viz., that which occurs in the relations of the waking serf to the dream-life. Whenever we 'remember a dream' we 'include' a dream self; whenever a dream rehearses forgotten memories, it 'includes' some contents of the waking self. Altogether, then, it seems that there is empirical support for the contention that one mind may be capable of including others, though it must be confessed that we do not as yet understand how this is done nor know what the limits of the process are. On the other hand, the religious value of these phenomena seems extremely dubious, and whether any such including mind can properly be identified with 'the Divine Mind' is another question altogether. On the whole, the evidence does not suggest that the including mind must be either one and the same for all, or worthy of the predicate 'divine.' But neither did the evidence suggest to any but those with a certain philosophic bias that the Absolute or cosmic whole tout cru was worthy of being deified: the natural inference is rather, as I suggested long ago,* that if all minds are comprehended in a Universal Mind as its dissociated personalities, this Absolute is mad. But as there is anyhow a good deal of madness to be included in the universe, this corollary might actually prove to be, theoretically, an advantage. By allowing my comments on Dr. Rashdall's paper to carry me so far, I find I have left myself too little space to deal with Professor Muirhead's. But it seems to me to illustrate very well what was said above about the postulatory character of religious conceptions and the naturalness of 'contradictions' in a mind distracted by conflicting desires. In the great army of Absolutism Professor Muirhead evidently belongs neither to the band that professes open atheism, nor to those who annex * Cf. Studies in Hunmanism, ch. xi.</page><page sequence="35">INDIVIDUAL MINDS AND THE MIND OF GOD. 143 the term ' God' and use it as a pseudonym for the Whole, but to the right wing that is genuinely puzzled to discover some reputable way of transferring the attributes of a Deity they cling to to the Whole they believe to be an intellectual necessity. This endeavour naturally leaves them exposed on both flanks. They have to make good their position on the one side against the antitheistic attacks of Messrs. Bradley and Bosanquet, and one is sorry to see that they still seem as unable to make headway against them as when Professor J. A. Stewart called attention to this weakness a good many years ago.* On the other side they have to maintain themselves against those who, whether or not they concede the validity of applying our notion of a whole to the real,t are at all events clear that the Ce ica 7rav can have neither religious nor moral value. But their severest struggle is evidently in their own minds, and with the contradictions and problems they engender. These difficulties would, of course, disappear if they would only abandon their philosophic ambitions, and be content with being merely religious and so with holding their beliefs as entirely 'matters of faith.' But as they claim to be philosophers who will not merge the logical standpoint in the psychological, it is impossible to help them, however much one sympathizes with their embarrassments. One can only watch their struggles to construct a coherent and intelligible conception of a Whole which is also worthy of being called 'God.' For my part I should predict their failure in the future, as in the past. They are likely to fail at the very first step they have to take, viz., in constructing the notion of an 'infinite' mind. This step Professor Muirhead skips when he formulates * Cf. Mind, XI, 369, No. 43. It is hardly possible to treat as serious expostulation the reference to the ambiguity of Hegel's use of aufgehoben. For though (as usual) Hegel was playing with words, and almost punning, there is no doubt that what he meant is what Mr. Bradley and Dr. Bosanquet have understood. t To me it seems very disputable. Cf. Proc. A ris. Soc., 1918, p. 253.</page><page sequence="36">144 F. C. S. SCHILLER. his problem of " making the relation between the infinite and the finite mind intelligible." For until the conception of infinite mind has been established, no question about its relation to finite minds can arise, and even then it will not follow that 'the' relation will be either single or simple. I entirely agree, however, with Professor Muirhead that the 'analogies' by which this paradoxical relation is construed, all break down. The dramatic analogy, which makes history a (senseless) game the Al'iv plays with himself, regardless of the feelings of his pieces, is sufficiently answered by its Omarian statement, that we become "But helpless Pieces of the Game He plays, Upon this chequer-board of Nights and Days, Hither and thither moves, and checks, and slays." The trouble about it is not intellectual, but moral. For whereas "The ball no question makes of Ayes and Noes, But Here or There, as strikes the Player, goes," we emphatically do. We do want to know whither we are going, and what the game is for. The inadequacy of the dissociation of personality analogy has been sufficiently discussed. The 'general will' analogy might do better service if it had been previously established that this hazy notion is not merely a metaphorical expression, either for the fact that the collective action of men differs in various but psychologically traceable respects from their indi- vidual action, or else for the political camouflage by which the ruled are beguiled into acquiescing in the acts of their rulers. There remains, then, only Professor Muirhead's own sug- gestion that the conception of purpose may bridge the gulf between the human mind and the Absolute. He is aware that this too involves difficulties, and mentions one of them, but not the greatest and most fatal. Yet it is obvious that purpose in a human mind is relative to its so-called ' finiteness.' A purpose implies a future, an end yet-to-be-attained, and a will</page><page sequence="37">INDIVIDUAL MINDS AND THE MIND OF GOD. 145 to use the necessary means. Why are means necessary ? Because of the defect of its power. Like all reasoning in the relation of means to ends, purpose presupposes a process of achieving and a limitation of the mind that entertains it. Purposes can only exist in minds that cannot achieve their ends by a mere fiat, and have to contemplate the fulfilment of their desires as ideals to be realised, before transforming them into actual facts. How, then, is it possible to attach any meaning to the notion of purpose in the unlimited operations of a universal mind? Let us grant Professor Muirhead his first step, that a mind can be conceived which can intelligibly be denominated 'universal.' That will not enable him to take his second step and to prove that such a mind can share a common meaning with all other minds. For if we ask what such phrases really mean, and discriminate between a claim to a 'common' meaning and a real assurance that it exists, we shall speedily find that what we need is a specific ground for the belief that a meaning has been effectively communicated and is really common. Such a ground is to be found only in the acts that ensue upon the communication. The way to show that we understand. what was meant when asked to shut the door, is to get up and shut it; the only convincing proof that we see a 'common' red is to agree with others in arranging colours. But where are the acts that prove to us that the Universal Mind understands our meanings, or conversely ? The most impossible step, however, is the third. What purpose is it humanly possible to attribute to the Universal Mind ? Is it to have unachieved ends in a distant future ? Is it to be limited in the choice of its means, so that it can display intelligence in our eyes by conforming its procedure to ours (cf. Proc. Aris. Soc., 1918, pp. 262-3)? Is it perchance to 'direct' the process and to develop the meanings of finite minds, and so to fall into process itself ? Surely the only 'purpose' that could conceivably be</page><page sequence="38">146 F. C. S. SCHILLER. ascribed to it would be that of in suo esse perseverare. For this would need no future achievement and need not imply any limitation in the self-satisfied mind that aims at only this. The only 'end,' 'purpose,' or 'will' we can attribute to the Absolute is that of preserving its identity, and being what it is to all eternity. But it is clear that this utterly breaks down the analogy with 'finite' mind. Such is not the nature of any human end or purpose. Our ends are not all eternally achieved. And so, if the Universal Mind is such as to inhabit a Nunc Stans, and if the only 'end' it is after is the preservation of what is, I for one cannot approve of it, or accept it as a common end for me to share in. For it would be a blank negation of all hope of progress or betterment, an inhuman stereotyping of all the evils and errors that exist. Morally speaking, there is nothing I can have in common with such an Absolute. I cannot swallow it, and if it absorbs me, it will have to digest an unmitigated con- tradiction. I do not say, of course, that it cannot do so, for with such a 'God' anything is possible, and there is every reason to anticipate the worst. Neither do I deny that such an attitude of moral protest may be vain, and crassly philistine, and unworthy of a truly eulightened rationalism which has soared far above "the red mist of doing" and the crudities of the moral judgment. It may even be irreligious, if it be de rigueur to construe quite prosaically the metaphors of devotion and ecstasy. But, if so, I am tempted to retort that the self-surrender of the absolutist to his deity is not perhaps quite so innocent of self-interest as it looks. It emphasises one side only of the transaction. But when we look at the other, it will be seen to be a shrewd bargain redolent of canniness or self-conceit. For does it not mean self-deification on its other side, and require the Uni- versal Mind to identify itself with Tom, Dick, and Harry ? And one can well imagine that even though there be a Uni- versal Mind capable of absorbing Tom, Dick, and Harry, it</page><page sequence="39">INDIVIDUAL MINDS AND THE MIND OF GOD. 147 might find them anything but palatable. I should conclude, therefore, that if a tithe of the ingenuity which has been bestowed upon the deifying of the Whole had been devoted to exploring the possibilities of a divine intelligence more in accord with human nature, philosophic inquiry might have attained results far more considerable and satisfactory.</page><page sequence="40">148 c. F. D'ARCY. IV. By C. F. D'ARCY, Bishop of Down. As one who is prepared to give an affirmative answer to the question which is the theme of our discussion, I have the singular advantage of having before me the arguments of two very powerful and persuasive critics on the negative side. In philosophy, as in most other things, it is always easier to be destructive than constructive, to attack than to defend. It was therefore a nice judgment which allowed the disputants on the positive side in this controversy to know the main lines of their opponents' assault. It was also a generous arrangement, for which we have reason to be grateful. May I say that I should have welcomed a more detailed examination of the meaning of the word " include" ? It is full of ambiguities. (1) It has a spatial or material sense. The largest of a set of Chinese boxes includes all the rest. It is not in this sense that the mind of God can be said to include individual minds. Yet it is well to be clear on this point, because philosophers and psychologists have a habit of using spatial, or material, metaphors with great and dangerous freedom. Thereby they gain an illusive and misleading clearness. The late William James was sometimes misled by his pictorial imagination. (2) The word "include" can be used in a logical sense. A more general notion includes a number of less general notions. A genus includes many species. A species includes many individuals. Here the abstract includes the concrete. It seems to me very important to define this meaning. There are forms of Hegelianism which give an affirmative answer to our question, because they identify God with the universal idea. T. H. Green seems to have been sometimes misled in this way. Some of his language seems to reduce God</page><page sequence="41">INDIVIDUAL MINDS AND THE MIND OF GOD. 149 to an abstract principle of unity. I do not think that Hegel himself ever really faced this problem. He seems to me to vary, sometimes endeavouring to grasp the concrete, and some- times falling back on the easy inclusiveness of abstraction. (3) It is possible to speak of a self including its experience. Or perhaps it would make for clearness if we said that experience includes all the elements into which it can be diferentiated. The experience of a self is certainly possessed of a peculiar unity. It is a whole. It is concrete, not abstract. It can be differentiated by processes which can be variously described by such terms as attention, abstraction, thought, purpose. Any particular instance of mental activity will be found to contain all these processes in varying degrees. The particular thing, idea, or object, which is thus presented, is always a part of experience, taking its place in the whole, and linked up by innumerable relations with all other elements in experience. Thus, the experience of a self includes an indefinite multitude of things, ideas wishes, aims, etc. Each one of these, as presented in conscious- ness, is an object; so that we may say that the experience of the self includes all its objects. Here the concrete includes the abstract. If we are to think of God including human minds, we must surely begin our investigation from this third sense of the word. God cannot be another name for infinite space, nor can He be an abstract formula. He must be, at least, a self with experience. And here we come up sharp against the objec- tion which I take to be Dean Rashdall's central criticism. If God is a self and all other minds are included within His experience, then these other minds must be, in relation to Him, objects, not subjects. But, as Dean Rashdall points out, "The essence of a mind is what it is for itself, not what it is for another. The essence of a mind is not to be known, but to know, to will, to feel-in a word, to be conscious." This criticism seems to me to be thoroughly sound. If God be but one self among many, He cannot, it would seem to me, be all-inclusive in</page><page sequence="42">150 c. F. D'ARCY. relation to the multitude of human selves. The arguments from telepathy and mental dissociation seem to me to prove nothing. Even if it be true that the whole or part of the content of one mind can be shared by another, the for-itself- ness, which is the essence of selfhood, is incommunicable. Here, again, Dean Rashdall's argument seems to me unanswerable. But it has not been proved that the content of any mind, as qualified by its own peculiar point of view, can be shared by another mind. The very disagreement between the dis- sociated selves in the abnormal cases referred to by Dr. Schiller is an indication of this. It is my complete agreement with Dean Rashdall in this contention that forces me to accept Mr. Bradley's doctrine that the self does not supply us with a satisfying account of the nature of the Absolute, while dissenting emphatically from his further doctrine that the individual self with all its peculiar experiences is merged, transmuted, lost, in a single relationless immediacy. In regard to this last conclusion, the criticisms of Dean Rashdall and Professor Pringle-Pattison seem unanswerable. Let me now venture to set forth briefly the reasons which seem to me to prove the necessity of believing in the all- inclusiveness of God. The argument consists in a careful feeling of the way upward from the lower levels of experience to the higher. I ask you to follow a lowly path. Nor do I profess to reach a conclusion which cannot be criticised. Like all conclusions arrived at on probable grounds it will be open to the charge that it involves contradictions. Dr. Schiller has pointed out with great clearness that science is never afraid of contradictions, because she is well aware that all her conclusions are provisional. " Self-contradictions," as he says, "are normal incidents in the development of scientific notions. For such notions have continually to assimilate new discoveries." He is quite right; but why does he refuse to the gropings of theology the freedom he claims for the gropings of science ? Philosophy</page><page sequence="43">INDIVIDUAL MINDS AND THE MIND OF GOD. 151 is really in a better position than science in this respect, because she can more frequently show how the contradictions arise. What we have to consider first is the relation between self and the world. The material world, as I know it, is a portion of my experience. Or put it thus-All of the material world, so far as it is known to me, is a portion of my experience. It is included within that sphere of knowledge and effort which I call my experience, and which, from my point of view, is myself. I do not think that the new realists have done any- thing to overthrow this position. All they have done is to call mind awareness, and to transfer the activities of thought and effort to the world of which mind is aware, which still remains a whole constituted by these activities. And M. Bergson, who is commonly supposed to be a realist, has done more than anyone else to show that we think and make our world to suit our practical needs. It would seem to me that the new realism is only a complicated way of getting to the position of the old idealism. We have then self including the world of its experience. But there is a multitude of selves, each including the world of its own distinctive experience. And there is a great universe of things in space which, somehow or other, integrates all the spatial worlds included in all experiences. Or, to put it in the language of common sense, we all know, each in his own partial way, the same great material universe. That is the fundamental fact which must form the basis of every possible doctrine. Now, if I understand Dean Rashdall and those who agree with him aright, they are prepared, on the analogy of human experience, to argue from the material universe to the exist- ence of God. They conclude that, because our minds are organic to experience, and therefore to nature, and because nature at the same time passes beyond all human experiences, a great world-positing mind must exist. But why do they stop</page><page sequence="44">152 c. F. D'ARCY. there ? What is the relation between that great world-positing mind and our minds ? Surely there must be some interpretation of the fact that our knowledge of the material universe is the partial knowledge of an experience greater than our own. How is it that the experience of God integrates all our experiences ? Green used to explain it by saying that an eternally complete consciousness realises itself gradually and with interruptions in our consciousness. That will not satisfy us now. But we must have some explanation of a fact so fundamental. One thing is surely quite clear. There must be some organic relationship between the world-consciousness and the human consciousness. God and the multitude of human minds cannot form a mere collection of separate disconnected monads. It seems to me that, in Dean Rashdall's thought, they are nothing more than this. But that is impossible, for, on the material side, the relationship of the corresponding worlds of experience is a unification so complete that it is hard to distinguish it from identity. There must, therefore, be in God, not only a world-positing self, but a principle which brings into unity the seemingly disconnected multiplicity of the spiritual world. This means that self-hood, while true as a description of the nature of God, so far as we can see, is not sufficient. There must be a principle of unity which overcomes the oppositions between selves and creates a final unification. If this be correct, it would seem that to describe God in terms of self-hood, or personality, is insufficient. He is personal and something more. Here we seem to be driven back to Mr. Bradley's Absolute, or something very like it. But must we suppose that, in the final unification, all the personal distinctions which mark the world of our experience are absorbed and lost ? Does pain cease to be pain ? Are good and evil merged and transmuted ? Here is where, it seems to me, Mr. Bradley has allowed his metaphysics to obscure the teaching of experience. If we keep close to experience, we shall find that we are led to a very different</page><page sequence="45">INDIVIDUAL MINDS AND THE MIND OF GOD. 153 conclusion. The basis of all our reasonings is the relation between the mind and its experience of the world. The mind, or self, in its experience of the material universe, acts the part of a unifier. The unity of the self is the unity of experience, and this is the unity of all that we know. But does this unification deprive the individual thing within the world of our experience of its proper quality ? We know that it does not. On the contrary, it is the relations which each thing bears to everything else which constitutes its peculiar nature and gives it its character: and these relations are parts of the system contained within, and sustained by, the whole unity of experience. So far then as our experience extends, the unification of a multiplicity does not involve the absorption of the peculiar quality of each element. On the contrary, it insures the preservation of that quality. Now as mind unifies the multiplicity of the material world, so does God unify the multiplicity of the spiritual world. And, as in the former case, unification involves the securing to each element of its proper nature, so surely we must expect that the unification of the spiritual world in God involves the securing to every individual self of its own peculiar character. That is the teaching of analogy; and we have no other guide. There are three stages of reality under our review:- (1.) The material universe. (2.) The principle of self-hood. (3.) God-the ultimate unity and unifier. The first and second of these we know, and the relation between them. The third, in its final nature, we do not know; but from the relation between the first and second, we can form a judgment as to the relation, in certain respects, between the second and the third. Our knowledge in this latter case can never be complete, but it can be sufficient to satisfy us as to the security of the foundations of our life. So far, we have considered this subject mainly from the side of knowledge. It is specially interesting to consider it from the side of will. Let us take the three stages of reality just M</page><page sequence="46">154 c. F. D'ARCY. mentioned: the material world, the self, God. The more fully the material world is examined, the more completely does it resolve itself into a system of necessary causes and effects. There is no place left for freedom, or, shall we say, spontaneity. The appearance is presented of a great universal order in which everything is settled beforehand. Thinkers who have become absorbed in this way of regarding the world come to believe in a doctrine of universal mechanical determinism. Mind comes to be regarded as an epiphenomenon, a meaning- less phosphorescence playing over the surface of an iron necessity. Practical experience, however, shows us man controlling natural forces for his own purposes. Moreover, it is the uniformity of natural law which gives man his power over natural forces. If these forces worked capriciously, it would be impossible to count upon their producing any desired effect. The more science extends the area of natural necessity, the more complete becomes man's power to subordinate nature to his will. In fact, the necessary sequence of physical cause and effect is the essential and appropriate instrument of freedom. Here we have a singular illustration of the dominance of the practical, and of the misleading character of a philosophy based exclusively on a speculative foundation. I hope I carry Dr. Schiller with me in this contention. The only possible interpretation of the fact I have just set before you seems to me to be this: the material world within which necessity reigns is an abstract world. It is isolated from the rest of experience by a process of abstraction, and when so isolated and defined is found to be a coherent whole, just as the still more abstract world of geometry is isolated and found to be a coherent whole. The wider spiritual world includes therefore within itself these narrower worlds. But the elements in these narrower worlds do not become lost or absorbed in the greater world. On the contrary, they persist, maintaining always their own peculiar character, and just because they do so,</page><page sequence="47">INDIVIDUAL MINDS AND THE MIND OF GOD. 155 contributing to the full and proper life of the larger world in which they are included. Now, suppose it be true that there is a higher spiritual life in which all human minds are included, we must surely be guided by this analogy and believe that, in that higher life, every human mind retains its own peculiar individuality and character. Further, I hold that we must postulate such a higher spiritual life, because there is no other way of recon- ciling two facts that we know to be true: (1) the incomplete- ness with which each individual human mind grasps the physical world in its dealing with the practical problems of its life, and (2) the common use of the physical world in which we all share. If this be a correct inference, it is clear that the higher spiritual life cannot be completely defined in terms of personality or self-hood. But we know no principle higher than personality; and therefore it will be said the argument is an effort to explain the known by the unknown. This is an obvious objection. But it is founded on a misapprehension. The argument I have ventured to place before you is based on analogy. It advances from the known relation of the material and the spiritual, as lower and higher in the scale of being, to the relation of the spiritual as it is in us and the spiritual as it must exist in the whole. The argument may be compared with that by which physicists arrived at the doctrine of the ether. Finding it necessary to suppose the existence of some medium more universal than matter and not manifesting itself in the ways characteristic of matter, they used the material analogy as far as they could, and corrected it where it failed to correspond with the facts. So for us, contemplating the necessity of some supreme, all-embracing, unity, it cannot be illegitimate to use the idea of self-hood, or personality, as far as it will go, and, where it fails, fall back on the idea of a universal concrete unification. May I say that I agree fully with Dr. Schiller that the M2</page><page sequence="48">156 c. F. D'ARCY. Absolute is "properly speaking nothing but a technical name for the Whole." But it makes all the difference in the world how we conceive the whole. If we think of the whole in terms of crude physics, as a mere collection of things in time and space, the Absolute can certainly have no religious value. Or if we conceive it in pluralistic terms, as a multitude of selves with or without an independent physical environment, the Absolute as such will not stir religious emotions. These emotions, if they exist, will attach themselves to the idea of one self supreme among the rest, or perhaps a group of selves, conceived as eminently mighty, good, or worthy of devotion. It is here worth our consideration that Dr. McTaggart has presented the idea of the Absolute as a system of selves, and has apparently found in this conception religious value of a very high order. It is a phase of thought curiously charac- teristic of our time; for it may be called a democratic con- ception of the Absolute. Most interesting, however, is it to observe that Dr. McTaggart secures the religious value of his doctrine by insisting on the unity which is involved in the fact that the selves form a system. While the whole or the Absolute is conceived as a mere collection of things, or of persons and things, or of persons only, it has no religious value. But the moment there comes the conception of a universal unity, a spiritual whole in which every life has a sphere and function, religious value arises. If we believe in God as the all-inclusive life of the universe, and as in this sense the Absolute, or the Whole, we attain a conception which has proved itself, in the many forms in which it has been expressed, whether in theology, in mysticism, or in poetry, to possess the highest possible religious value. Professor Muirhead rests his contention for the affirmative side in our discussion on the sharing of meaning and purpose which is possible to selves. I have no doubt he is right in considering that here we have an indication of the existence of a universal mind. But it seems to me a mistake to suppose</page><page sequence="49">INDIVIDUAL MINDS AND THE MIND OF GOD. 157 that it would help us at all, were we able to prove that selves interpenetrate one another. It would certainly not prove that they are included in the mind of God. For, if it belonged to the nature of a self to include all other selves, the Absolute would be already given in every experience. There would be either no God at all, or the human self would be the only possible God. It is the very multiplicity of the spiritual world which forces us to believe in a uniting principle higher than that of the individual self. Dean Rashdall holds that the contents of consciousness are for every self unique and incom- municable. While not accepting language which seems to imply that consciousness is divided up into distinct and isolated moments, I agree with him that, as between one human self and another, the concrete contents of each mind are its own exclusive possession. Only abstract elements, such as meanings and purposes, can be conveyed from one to another. But it is this very human limitation which forces us to seek the final unification in God. And it is just here that the religious value of the all-inclusiveness of God appears. The religious mind always thinks of God as knowing the secrets of every heart. And, as to the instance of pain, which Dean Rashdall thinks so conclusive, we have surely had sufficient evidence in the course of recent events that the only conception of God for which suffering humanity has any use is that which presents Him as sharing in all human sufferings. I am anxious to make it clear that in all that I have said hitherto I have carefully avoided all such conceptions as "Infinite Mind," " Omnipotence," "Nunc Stans," and so on. The whole argument rests on the limitations of self-hood as it exists in us, the necessity of believing in a higher unification, and the analogy from the relation of the material world, and the self to the relation of the self and the higher unity. This is not a metaphysical argument in the old sense at all. But I feel justified in falling back on metaphysics in the full sense of the term, and pressing an argument which seems to me really</page><page sequence="50">158 INDIVIDUAL MINDS AND THE MIND OF GOD. unanswerable when once the spiritual view of reality is admitted. In a spiritual world the whole is prior to the parts in the order of being. William James and others may have thrown stones in a highly entertaining fashion at this doctrine, but they never succeeded in overthrowing it. The order of becoming is one thing, the order of being is another. If a meaning or a purpose is being worked out by slow degrees, the full reality of the whole is to be found, not in any stage of the process, but in its completion. Isolate any individual experience and suppose it complete-which in practice it never is--and the full reality, the whole, is the self. The full reality, the whole, of the universe cannot then be a plurality; it cannot be a collection of things or selves; it must be an all-inclusive unity. Nor can this all-inclusive unity be a mere individual self, because the individual self is always one among many: for no individual experience is, or can be, a complete self-sufficing whole. It will be evident that this doctrine is but the old a priori proof of the being of God turning up once again. It is what Hegel expressed in his own curious fashion in a famous passage. And it is hard to see how it can be controverted, if it is once admitted that the texture of experience is spiritual, not material. In view of recent criticisms of the " idealist " position, may I add that I accept, in the most exact and literal sense, the statement, said to be the basis of modern realism, that "the knower is everywhere in direct relation with his object." It is the real world that we know, not our own " ideas." This seems to me the very essence of all true idealism. But I am quite content to adopt Professor Pringle-Pattison's language, and say that mind is organic to the world, and the world organic to mind. Yet surely this must include the primary and secondary as well as the tertiary qualities.</page></plain_text>
