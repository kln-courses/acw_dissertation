Introduction The first Australians are believed to have arrived by boat some 50 60,000 years ago1 with the northern coastline of the continent a likely beach-head.2 The prospect of intact or even partial remains of ancient watercrafi turning up in the archaeological record is remote.3 The expansion and contraction of the coastline over the last 60,000 years means that early landing sites would have been inundated as sea levels rose and fell, and the organic materials, perhaps wood or other plant material, from which such early watercraft would have been constructed have long since rotted away.4 Rock art assemblages from Australia's north then, represent the most likely record of venturesome mariners, who may have reached the coast over the millennia since initial occupation, or of watercraft constructed by Aboriginal inhabitants settled in coastal regions. Australia's vast coastline was the point of entry from the earliest landings on the continent to recent European colonisation, and remained so until the middle of the twentieth century. Mariners arriving on the coast were guaranteed a relatively resource-rich welcome to what is largely, an arid continent. The significance of the role the sea plays in 55</page><page sequence="2">The Great Circle June Ross and Meg Travers Vol. 35, No. 2. the life of coastal dwellers is emphasised by Clarke &amp; Frederick:5 For Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians alike, the sea is as significant as the land for our shared histories. It is understood as the space of arrival and departure and as a continuing source of sustenance. Indigenous Australians sing and perform the sea in ritual ... For non-Indigenous Australians the sea also serves a central role in the foundation narratives of the colony characterized in oceanic journeys, continental circumnavigations and coastal explorations. The events, outcomes, and historical figures of these colonial endeavours are commemorated in song, story and art... by Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians alike. Rock art from the coastal fringe therefore is a potential source of information about arrivals and the cross-cultural interactions between Indigenous inhabitants and newcomers. As all newcomers arrived on watercraft of some type, rock art assemblages that include depictions of boats provide a visual record of the ways in which Aboriginal people chose to represent particular aspects of their encounters with outsiders. Boat depictions are produced as a result of observing and experiencing other cultural groups and their watercraft, thus they form an important archive of cross cultural interaction imbued with social meaning. We propose that the boat depictions from the northwest Kimberley, the social and environmental context of their production, set against ethnographic and historical evidence can be used to examine the 'complexity of relationships, meanings, representations and exchanges'6 between local inhabitants and outsiders. Ethnographic and historical records of the last two centuries attest to the incorporation of new marine technology and the adoption of new watercraft by Aboriginal groups in the northwest Kimberley. In many regions of Australia, contact between outsiders and Aboriginal populations is considered to have a time depth measured in hundreds of years. An analysis of the rock art assemblage could provide evidence of an earlier period of contact in the northwest Kimberley. The Change and Continuity Research Project The current research, commenced in 2010, has been undertaken as part of a collaborative project that aims to develop a broader understanding of the past lives of the Aboriginal people in the northwest Kimberley. A multidisciplinary team, in partnership with Wunambal Gaambera people, are addressing questions relating to the initial occupation of the region, and questions that seek to establish a timeframe for stylistic 56</page><page sequence="3">The Great Circle 'Ancient Mariners ' Vol. 35, No. 2. changes in the vast rock art assemblage, and explain the social and environmental circumstances in which these events occurred. Wunambal Gaambera Country lies in the northwest Kimberley area of Western Australia (Figure 1). It incorporates some 200 kilometres of ragged coastline including the Bonaparte Archipelago and Admiralty Gulf, and a scattering of islands and offshore reefs. The Wunambal Gaambera people explain that the saltwater Wanjina, called Gayarra 'created the sea (saltwater country), coastal mountains, rivers, rocky shores, sandy beaches, mangroves and reefs and put all the things in our saltwater country'.7 The significance of saltwater country to Aboriginal people both today and in the past is evident in the archaeological record and the activities of the Ancestral Beings. The present-day coastline comprises deeply indented bays, river estuaries, mangrove swamps and sandy beaches and is subjected to 'dangerous and rapid tidal surges',8 and in the wet season to violent Figure 1 .The Northwest Kimberley 57</page><page sequence="4">The Great Circle June Ross and Meg Travers Vol. 35, No. 2. tropical storms and occasional cyclonic winds. Aboriginal people attribute such extreme weather events to the actions of Ancestral Beings.9 Deep gorges have been scoured out by two major regional rivers, the Mitchell (Kandiwal)10 and the Lawley (Dorre) as they flow through a series of dramatic waterfalls from their headwaters on the Mitchell Plateau (Ngauwudu) to the sea. Abundant rockshelters suitable for occupation have formed in the deeply dissected King Leopold Sandstone. The smooth light coloured substrates within the overhangs and rockshelters provide ideal surfaces for the production of rock art. The area is extremely rugged and remote with access limited to boat, helicopter or foot. Nine topographic and environmental zones were targeted for archaeological surveys during the project including riverine corridors, coastal rockshelters and middens, and wooded grasslands, inland on the plateau. Two hundred and nine rock art sites have been fully documented, samples have been collected for dating the rock art assemblage, nine excavations have been completed and extensive archaeological and environmental surveys have been undertaken. Watercraft in the northwest Kimberley rock art assemblage jf-p Figure 2. Sailing vessels, Lawley River, left) LR16-1-7602, right) LR16-1-7603 58</page><page sequence="5">The Great Circle 'Ancient Mariners' Vol. 35, No. 2. As part of the current research, seventeen depictions of watercraft (Table 1 on page 60) were documented in the rock art assemblage within the Mitchell and Lawley River catchments (Figure 2). These will be considered alongside an additional twenty-three watercraft depictions from adjacent areas along the northwest Kimberley coastline (Table 2 on page 61). The types of vessels most commonly represented are canoes and two masted sailing ships, probably sloops or schooners typical of the European-style trading, pearling or fishing vessels that operated along the northern coastlines from the 1870s." The watercraft are executed in a variety of styles and an array of pigments, and range from relatively simple outlines and silhouettes, to more detailed bi-chrome paintings, some with crews and aspects of marine technology depicted. Most are painted in shades of mulberry, red or yellow ochre, with others produced in white kaolinite or huntite, some are drawn with charcoal and a single example is engraved. The relative state of weathering varies across the depictions from fresh, bright paintings and sharp drawings to paintings with eroded sections, and others obscured by opaque silica skins. The variation in the form and apparent age of watercraft depictions poses a number of questions. Are they images of ancient mariners observed from the shore, or perhaps foreign arrivals or annual visitors? Alternatively, are they images of Aboriginal seafarers? If they are images (as some surely are) of intruders, what do the depictions and the context of their production say about relations between Aboriginal people and outsiders? How can we interpret the social 'meaning' of boats depicted in the assemblage? Clarke and Frederick's analysis of watercraft depicted in Groote Eylandt rock art demonstrates the potential of a study that does more than simply examine 'the configuration of the masts and sails, the decking, the hull structure, the rudders and the internal storage of dugout canoes and cooking pots'.12 By moving 'beyond technological and functional interpretations'13 they 'consider the complexity of social meaning embodied in the experiences encountered seeing and depicting boats and the associated dimensions of the cross cultural relationships they convey'.14 We begin with a technological and functional analysis.

Details of the hull shape and rigging denote the seaworthiness of the watercraft and the role it may have played in the lives of Aboriginal people in the past. The form, technique and context of boat motifs is analysed and compared to the relative stylistic sequence proposed by Grahame Walsh.15 Many of the boat motifs in the northwest Kimberley are depicted with crew. The predominance of anthropomorphic figures in early Kimberley rock art, especially in the Gwion Period provide examples with diagnostic characteristics and accoutrements for comparison with depictions of crew members as a means of placing them into a relative sequence. The distinctive bi-chrome forms and conventional renderings of the Wanjina period provide additional chronological markers. In a further attempt to refine the chronology, a number of dating techniques has been applied to the boat images in the research area including Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) (Kira Westaway), radiocarbon and Uranium Series dating (Maxime Aubert). On a broader scale, an analysis of geological substrates on which the motifs occur and the relative weathering of the motifs themselves provides more general supporting evidence of age. 61</page><page sequence="8">The Great Circle June Ross and Meg Travers Vol.35, No. 2. An analysis of the spatial distribution of particular boats, their relationships to sea level change, to seasonal foraging patterns and site occupation is undertaken, and associations between boat motifs and particular topographic or environmental features is assessed. In the Wellington Range, northwestern Arnhem Land, May et al.16 demonstrated the significance of plotting the distribution of contact motifs, showing that inhabitants altered their travel routes following participation in the trepang industry. Rock art evidence, in association with the wider archaeological context revealed a major departure from previous occupation patterns, and a withdrawal to just a few strategic sites in the Wellington Range during the period of contact. This contraction of residential mobility was seen as a means of taking advantage of the new economy. Subsequent restructuring of Indigenous land-use 'strengthened traditional practices, but also created new social capital'.17 History of South East Asian and European watercraft in the Kimberley Seafarers from South East Asia came predominately from Macassar in southern Sulawesi (now Udjung Pandang) and other parts of the Indonesian archipelago including the islands of Timor, Roti and Aru.18 All groups are now generally known under the term 'Macassans'. The fleet sailed south with the onset of the north-west monsoon in about December to collect marine resources along Australia's northern coastline. In particular, they scoured the shallow areas of continental shelf for trepang or beche-de-mer, a delicacy smoked on-shore and sold on to the Chinese for use in soups, as a stimulant and as an aphrodisiac.19 Turtle shell, clam meat, shark fins, wood and pearl shell were also collected.20 As the monsoon subsided around April or May, the fleet returned home with the south-east wind behind them. Ian Crawford, who completed a study of Macassan sites along the northwest Kimberley coast in the 1960s21 proposed that visits began between AD 1669 and 1750 but historical records of the Dutch East India Company suggest that the Macassar trade in trepang began about 1710, becoming more intense around 1720.22 However, new radiocarbon dates of 1664 AD for a wax rock art motif over-lying a painting of a Macassan perahu recorded at Djulirri in northwestern Arnhem Land23 62</page><page sequence="9">The Great Circle 'Ancient Mariners ' Vol. 35, No. 2. indicates that the earlier date proposed by Crawford might be a more accurate estimate for the founding of this industry in Australia. From the 1870s, visits from large Macassan vessels to the Kimberley coast declined to be replaced, in the early years of the twentieth century, by smaller perahus, especially from Roti and Timor,24 some with British or Australian captains.25 A different type of perahu called a leti-leti typical of vessels from eastern Java also visited the coast in the 1920s.26 During this period, Australian vessels using Aboriginal labour also began working the shallows off the Kimberley coast. The expansion of the Australian Fishing Zone from three to 12 nautical miles in 1968 and amendments to other relevant legislation discouraged fishing close to shore and made the collection of sedentary marine species illegal, which led to a further decline in the industry. However, the remoteness of the region allowed small numbers of Indonesian crews to continue to fish in the area unobserved.27 The Kimberley coast was known to Indonesian seafarers as Kaju Djawa2S, Kai Jawa or Kaju Jawa29 meaning 'situated by Marege' being the name for the areas to the east in Arnhem Land and the Gulf of Carpentaria where there is extensive historical and archaeological evidence of their fishing activities.30 The term Kaju Jawa derives from a particular mangrove tree that grows along the mud flats of the Kimberley, the bark of which was used to give the bêche-de-mer a distinctive red colour.31 Trepang was collected and processed on-shore by Macassans from Napier Broome Bay in the north and southwest as far as Cape Leveque.32 History of Indigenous Kimberley watercraft Anthropologist and long-time Kimberley scholar, Kim Akerman33 has reviewed historical accounts and ethnographic evidence to produce a detailed history of Indigenous watercraft used in the Kimberley over the past two centuries. Early accounts suggest that watercraft of any type were scarce or non-existant in the Kimberley. William Dampier, explorer and buccaneer who sailed along the Kimberley coast in 1688, stated that the Aboriginal people he saw were swimming from one island to another as they did not have the use of any boats, canoes or bark-logs.34 Similarly, John Lort Stokes who sailed through the region almost 150 years later in 1838 recorded that he 'saw no single instance 63</page><page sequence="10">The Great Circle June Ross and Meg Travers Vol. 35, No. 2. of the use or even existence of any proa,35 or canoe'36 and concluded 'that the canoe is not used upon the north-west coast'.37 Stokes, however, noted the use of float logs or rafts in the region38 providing a description of the single fan-shaped raft. Kalumburu missionary, Father Seraphim Sanz de Galdeano, and Dolores Djinmora39 record two types of rafts, used by groups to the northeast of the research area, one for sea voyages and one for river crossings. Linguist, Arthur Capell40 recorded terms for rafts from three Wunambal dialects indicating that rafts were used in Wunambal Gaambera country in the past although they do not appear to have been depicted in the rock art of the region. Missionary, J.R.B. Love41 reported that by the 1930s, the kalum or double raft, built and used by the Worora, was found from King Sound to the Prince Regent River but was not used by the Wunambal or people further to the northeast. Akerman42 assigned the origin of dugout canoes in the north Kimberley to Macassan fishermen. Fleets of perahus sailed from South East Asia bringing with them canoes, which they used to collect trepang (nguru ngururu) and turtle from the shallows. Crawford suggested that as well as the theft of canoes from the Macassans: Aborigines could gain some benefits by allowing peaceful access to water and to wood, some probably worked for the Makasans, and Aboriginal women provided sex: in return, Aborigines received food and drink, iron goods and perhaps a dugout canoe at the end of the season. With iron tools, they learnt how to make dugout canoes, and these gave them safer access to the more remote islands off the coast.43 By 1938 when Andreas Lommel, a member of the Frobenius expedition arrived in the northwest Kimberley, he recorded that the canoe had become the preferred form of transport for the Wunambal stating that 'when travelling in their territory the Unambal go by sea as far as possible. They journey by dugout canoe'.44 Crawford45 and Akerman46 state that Aborigines constructed canoes using metal {labra) axes or adzes and 'a large investment in labour' (Figure 3). Petri, another member of the Frobenius expedition recorded that canoes were fashioned from the massive trunks of the kadjeput trees (a genus of Melaleuca) 'in a lengthy and laborious operation'.47 He detailed the method used to hollow out the log where sections were burnt and the charcoal layers removed. He noted that these vessels had 'the advantage 64</page><page sequence="11">The Great Circle 'Ancient Mariners ' Vol. 35, No. 2. ••'v. TT ir Figure 3. Traditional canoe, made in Kalumburu by Waigan Djanghara in 1976 (photo Kim Akerman) that many individuals can travel in them dry and with their household effects'48 and that canoes afforded 'better protection against the large alligators [sic] sharks and water snakes'.49 It is evident then, that within the past two centuries there has been considerable change in the types of watercraft used by the Aboriginal people of the Kimberley.50 Depictions of Watercraft Of the forty watercraft depicted in the rock art assemblage across the northwest Kimberley (Tables 1 &amp; 2), twenty-eight represent canoes and twelve sailing vessels. Two results were unexpected. First, sailing vessels and canoes are the only motifs in the northwest Kimberley rock art assemblage identifiable as depictions of outsiders, or their material culture; there is nothing that represents 'the shock of the new'.51 O'Connor et al.52 recorded a similarly sparse contact rock art assemblage in the southern Kimberley. Walsh, referring to motifs produced over the past two hundred years relates the absence of 'contact' motifs to the religious role that rock art played in the most recent Wanjina period suggesting that people 'resisted any divergence to record the secular wonders of new people, animals and objects'.53 This singling out of watercraft as the only record of new arrivals attests to the importance of sea-faring vessels as defining symbols of the technology and culture of foreigners. Second, there are no depictions at all of the classic perahu so evident in the Arnhem Land and Groote Eylandt rock art assemblages,54 nor are there any depictions of steam ships. Perahu were rigged with a distinctive tripod mast and a tilted rectangular main sail.55 Rather, the sailing 65</page><page sequence="12">The Great Circle June Ross and Meg Travers Vol. 35, No. 2. vessels depicted in the northwest Kimberley assemblage represent the types of vessels used in the more recent past such as luggers, sloops and schooners suggesting that interaction between Macassans and the Aboriginal population may have developed more slowly than in other parts of the northern coastline so that it was not until the early twentieth century that sailing vessels were incorporated into the art assemblage. Artistic conventions appear to persist through time, with all but two of the 40 watercraft depicted in profile, a perspective that provides the greatest opportunity to portray characteristic details that define each type of watercraft. All sailing vessels recorded are relatively recent, pearling luggers, two masted schooners and possibly a sloop.56 The shape and proportion of canoe motifs differs: many comprise a simple outline while others incorporate superstructure, paddles and steering oars. Of the canoes, eighteen are manned with at least one crew member, while a single example is shown with seven standing crew members (Figure 4). Only two sailing vessels are depicted with crew on board, one with a single sailor and the other with two crew members. It is clear that people are not as strongly associated with sailing vessels as they are with canoes suggesting that the people onshore were less familiar with those on board the vessels. A similar absence of crew was identified by Clarke and Frederick in Groote Eylandt depictions, and they contended 'that European boats, and the peoples associated with them, were glimpsed or sighted rather than directly encountered'.57 However, the history of marine industries along the northwest Kimberley coastline includes accounts of Aboriginal people working as crew members or actively involved in on-shore activities such as the collection of wood for processing the trepang catch. One painting of a schooner (CC04-6 3566) has a group of nine figures surrounding the vessel. The figures are depicted with their arms raised as if waving (Figure 5) providing some evidence of closer interaction between the local inhabitants and the visiting fishermen. The inclusion of these figures is unusual as recent Kimberley rock art shows a disregard for the depiction of humans and their daily activities, rather the focus of artists was on Ancestral Beings, spirit figures and totemic species. The depiction of crew members is not as tightly constrained by artistic convention as the form of the boats themselves. Crew in vessels 66</page><page sequence="13">The Great Circle 'Ancient Mariners ' Vol. 35, No. 2. produced over the past two centuries are more likely to be painted or drawn in a full frontal position, while canoes are shown with crews in a "IBSPSEê?-» Figure 4.

All the depictions of sailing vessels are at sites within seven kilometres (an easy walk) of the present day coastline and are in rockshelters that provide protection from the extremes of Kimberley weather. The rock art assemblage at Camp Creek where five of the sailing vessels were recorded includes more than 300 motifs representing all phases of Kimberley rock art production, attesting to the ongoing significance of this site. Depictions of canoes are located at shoreline sites on Bigge Island and at One Tree Beach (OTB02-5-2272, OTB05-3-2352) but also on sites adjacent to the Mitchell River, a considerable distance *;• ifp ifi&lt;\£Y * V*' -i:' - i J &gt; 1 v. -v- a **:•- 2-» &lt;»C&gt;. * &amp;V * n f^&gt;"3£iDF *#' '.^ *W&gt; •' ■' yl ,. • -I'l "S TVi . : iliilf 1 ' Figure 7.

The art site at Bigge Island is the only location where both sailing boats and canoes are included in the assemblage. One of the coastal canoe motifs (OTB05-3-2352) is drawn with a fine, sharp ochre line in a style that is dissimilar to other drawn motifs recorded in the region, casting doubt on the origin and age of the motif (Figure 6). Ian Crawford58 recorded a large red and white image in a cavernous rockshelter in the lower Lawley River area in the 1980s. Aboriginal informants travelling with him identified the motif as 'almost certainly a perhau with what appears to be a party of men and women on board'.59 The image (reproduced upside down and back to front) depicts a large, ovoid shape with a row of seven superimposed figures, many with exaggerated genitalia similar in form to motifs identified as 'spirit figures' by Traditional Owners today. The outline of the 'perhau' (LR03D-13-1429) depicts two Wanjina-style eyes, a short beak and a short tapering tail (Figure 7). Three similar images with beaks, tails and eyes have been recorded in the research area, all in locations close to present day shorelines. The largest is over eight metres in length and more than a metre wide, all are oval in shape, have irregular outlines and one has what appear to be reproductive organs under the 'tail'. The paintings do not appear to be literal representations of any marine or terrestrial animal evident in the region today. The informants' identification of the 'perhau' may rest on their observation of visiting South East Asian vessels, as some types of boats used by fishermen, traders and timber carriers in the late nineteenth century in northern waters had large eyes (oculi) painted on their bows60 to ward off evil spirits. For example, oculi feature on Macassan vessels depicted on Aboriginal bark paintings from Groote Eylandt.61 It may well be that the large 'eyes' portrayed on the 'perhau' motif led the informants to identify the painting as a Macassan vessel. The beak and tail could be seen as representing the bow sprit and stern in a manner similar to those depicted on Macassan perahus painted on bark.62 Sam Woolagoodjah described one type of perahu called a leti-leti stating that '... and they got the, might be some kind of animal written on it, you know, they got the head and body and neck. They're built like that'.63 However, as OSL dating of a mud-wasps' nest over one of the spirit figures superimposing the 'perhau', returned a minimum date of940±28 years (Kim-CA-7)64 the image cannot represent watercraft associated 69</page><page sequence="16">The Great Circle June Ross and Meg Travers Vol. 35, No. 2. with traditional Macassan trepang vessels or any other recent visitors to the Kimberley coast. A radiocarbon date on resin (LR3D-01) over the same figure returned a slightly older minimum date of 1,230±35 (S-ANU 33109.9551 ),65 supporting this conclusion. However, two brass objects, a flat rectangular block with a filed edge and a heavy rod, 52cm long, were found cached at sites in this complex and were probably scavenged from sailing vessels, indicating the strong association between this area and the coast. Father Nicholas d'Emo, a Spanish monk was one of three founding Catholic missionaries who established the Drysdale River Mission at Pago on Napier Broome Bay in 1908.66 During his time at the mission, Father Nicholas recorded numerous rock art sites along the coast from Pago (20km north of Kalumburu, where the Mission is located today) Olkww! diawiny not lo sc*k V XZH3" trJ- t——-7 r—d "" ' " Gnahwl &lt;)i&lt;tw&gt;ix; -v&gt;l to tai*\ ^ S &gt; WW" jf K 1 Figure 8.

However, Crawford68 identified Macassan hearths and pottery in the Parry Harbour area during his doctoral research indicating that the simple canoe outlines are likely to represent Macassan canoes. The canoe profiles drawn in the sand for Ian Crawford by Rankin Waranggala illustrated three typical forms of canoe69 (Figure 8). All of the canoe forms recorded by Father Nicholas fit within these parameters. Canoes may have been gifted to Aborigines after the Macassan fishing season was concluded, they may have been stolen by Aborigines or, alternatively they may represent canoes made by Aborigines for their own use.70 Father Nicholas concluded that a single depiction of a canoe 'measuring 44 feet long ... carved in a flat rock in one of the bays of Parry Harbour'71 seemed to serve 'as a model for the maker of canoes'72 although he questions the origin of the motif as the lines are 'so long'73 and so 'straight'.74 Ancient Mariners? Seven paintings of canoes were recorded in the Lower Mitchell Falls area (LMR01B-3-5790,91,93, LMR02N-1-6536,37 and LMRNOR2-2-6942,43), all within easy access to the lower reaches of the Mitchell River below the falls at the saltwater interchange. Walsh75 concluded that four of these canoes depict 'ancient' watercraft. Akerman remains unconvinced that the depictions of canoes in the rock art of this region76 represent ancient watercraft as the rockshelters in which they are located would have been 'in some cases more than a hundred kilometres'77 from the shoreline during the Last Glacial Maximum. The sites in the Lower Mitchell Falls area would have been approximately 50km from the nearest coastline at 1 Oka when sea level was 32m lower than present, and more than 250km at 20ka when the sea level was 129m below today's level.78 What remains unclear is the width and depth of the Mitchell River in the past, although it is unlikely to have been navigable when sea levels were considerably lower than today, when the river is broad and open to the sea from the Lower Falls. It is possible that the canoe depictions may illustrate watercraft used on 71</page><page sequence="18">The Great Circle June Ross and Meg Travers Vol. 35, No. 2. river systems. Depictions of watercraft have been recorded at considerable distances from the coast in other areas of Australia. Depictions of perahu in sites at Mount Borradaile in Arnhem Land are some 40-50km from the nearest coastal sites where Macassans erected their temporary settlements.79 In the southern Kimberley, O'Connor et al.*° recorded a depiction of a ship, thought to be a screw steamer in Mimbi Caves, nearly 300km from the coast. As the steamer probably dates from the late nineteenth century, traditional movements across country would have been disrupted by this time as Aborigines were drawn to the attractions of distant towns and pastoral stations. In contrast, Wunambal people led a relatively uninterrupted traditional life into the twentieth century. Crawford et a/.81 describe the traditional seasonal movements of people in the study area. Groups congregated on the coast to harvest marine resources in the late dry season when shell fish were in prime condition. With the coming of the rains in December, Aborigines moved back into the escarpment where they sought protection from the weather in the many sandstone rockshelters. When the rains abated, root crops were harvested on the alluvial flats associated with the rivers and after the country dried out, grass fires were lit on the upland slopes driving game such as kangaroo, emu and turkeys onto the plateau where they were speared. More recently, Aboriginal informants from the same area described a different pattern of seasonal movement82 where people congregated around permanent water wherever it occurred in the dry season providing opportunities to hold ceremonies, and dispersed across the landscape during the wet season. While neither of these accounts of seasonal movements provides evidence for long distance travel in itself, it is clear that people in the recent past utilised different ecological zones, a pattern likely to have considerable time depth. Walsh has argued that the high prow and stern evident in weathered canoe motifs (Figure 9) in the Lower Mitchell Falls area represent ocean-going reed boats. Walsh83 observed that watercraft in other parts of the world such as Egypt and Peru were made by binding reeds together in this form making them remarkably stable and capable of major ocean voyages. Further, Walsh suggests that 'the buoyancy of reed boats permits them to ride over very rough seas and their high flexibility permits them to flex effortlessly to follow wave contours'.84 72</page><page sequence="19">The Great Circle 'Ancient Mariners ' Vol. 35, No. 2. The potential for transoceanic crossing in reed boats was demonstrated by Thor Hyerdahl, who in 1970, on his second attempt, sailed from Morocco to Barbados in the West Indes in Ra II, a distance of approximately 6,100km in a vessel constructed from papyrus reeds.85 With the distance between Indonesian islands and Sahul in the past being as little as 120km, a similar reed or bamboo vessel would provide a suitable craft to make the sea crossing. Walsh eschews a local origin for the canoe arguing that reeds suitable for making ocean going watercraft do not grow in the Kimberley today, nor does bamboo. The only record of watercraft made with bundles of plant material in the northwest Kimberley describes rafts made with stacked bundles of bark used in freshwater billabongs and for inland river crossing rather than on the open ocean.86 In addition, the bowed shape of the canoes, especially the example above the Mitchell River (LMRNOR2-2-6942), is more extreme than any of the published canoe profiles (Figure 9), suggesting the form is unlike any plying the Kimberley waterways in the recent past. Figure 9. Canoes above Mitchell River, left) LMRNOR2-2-6942, right) LMRNOR2-2-6943 A comparison between the relative stylistic sequence formulated by Grahame Walsh (and broadly supported by our research) and the style in which crew members depicted in and around the canoes provides additional chronological evidence. A group of three canoes are painted on an exposed vertical panel that forms a low escarpment approximately three kilometres from the Mitchell River. The crew standing in the canoe (LMR01B-3-5790, Figure 4) are represented in a row of stiff, elongated, red figures, with narrow chests, round headdresses and no 73</page><page sequence="20">The Great Circle June Ross and Meg Travers Vol. 35, No. 2. hands. Four have a form of 'shoulder spike' or 'nosebone'. While the variation in form and features amongst Gwion style figures makes it difficult to accurately attribute these to a subgroup, they display features of Wararrajai Gwion Figures (Clothes Peg Figures) that emerge towards the end of the Gwion phase. The identification of the elongated solid bodies of the crew members as long robes or skirts on what are small figures87 is problematic as many of the later Gwion style figures have bodies without waist definition. Both the other canoes at this site have crews with similar features although headdress details are varied with those on LMR01B-3-5793 similar to those classified as 'Hand' headdresses by Grahame Walsh. An excavation88 adjacent to the canoe panel produced evidence of occupation dating back to 13,000±1,000 BP (OSL, Kira Westaway). Seventeen additional rock art sites were recorded in this area with examples of grass prints, Gwion, Painted Hand and Wanjina Periods art indicating that the area has been used over an extended period of time. The pair of canoes (LMRNOR2-2-6942 and LMRNOR2-2-6943) painted at the base of a vertical shelf in a low rockshelter overlooking the Mitchell River depict seated or kneeling crews (Figure 9). Figures are shown in profile, some leaning back in a position typical of rowing or paddling although no oars are depicted. The five figures in the right hand canoe (LMRNOR2-2-6943) are painted in red orange ochre with their folded legs clearly visible through the eroded ochre of the hull. Despite the deterioration of the motifs, details of the figures can be identified when the photograph is digitally enhanced using DStretch.89 All three figures at the back of the canoe have 'shoulder spikes' or 'nosebone' features similar to those identified at the previous site suggesting that they too could be classified as Wararrajai Gwion figures. The second crew member from the stern is depicted wearing a headdress type known as a 'Cap with Ribbons', which Walsh attributes to the Wararrajai Gwion Period (Clothes Peg Period), a conclusion that our analysis supports. The second canoe at this site provides additional evidence to support our conclusion that the figures relate to the Wararrajai Gwion Period. The original red orange canoe has been repainted with a dark red pigment with a roughly executed, rectangular cross-hatched infill, perhaps intended to represent the material from which the canoe was 74</page><page sequence="21">The Great Circle 'Ancient Mariners ' Vol. 35, No. 2. constructed. However, literal interpretations of infill have proved problematic in the past.90 Again, several of the crew are depicted with 'shoulder spikes' or 'nosebone' features similar to those described previously. A pair of multi-barbed spears, aligned back-to-back in the characteristic manner associated with the Wararrajai Gwion Period are stored in the stern of the canoe. Two cross-legged figures with stylistic characteristics representative of the same period have been added in the same pigment as the repainted hull, one with an outstretched arm overlying the stern of the canoe indicating that the figures must post date the original, poorly preserved canoe. Significantly, the stylistic features of the two figures sitting beside the boat indicate that they too could be classified as Wararrajai Gwion figures. They are depicted with straight limbs, without defined muscles, hands and feet, or headdresses, they have narrow chests and round heads, and lack the grace of Elegant Action Figures, the period to which many cross-legged figures are assigned in Walsh's sequence. The last pair of canoes at LMR02N are also painted along the base of a vertical hanging ledge. The crew in these canoes are more difficult to discern and to classify as they lack detail and appear as simple stick figures (Figure 10). A mineral skin has formed an opaque film over parts of the motifs and another section of the motif is obscured where water runs down the panel. However, the size of the figures in relation to the size of the canoe suggests that the canoe is reasonably large, perhaps large enough for an ocean voyage. The inclusion of a cargo or superstructure in each of the canoes suggests a larger capacity than a simple dugout canoe. Attempts at dating the mineral coatings covering the pair of canoe Figure 10. DStretch images of canoes, Lower Mitchell River, a) LMR02N-1-6536, b) LMR02N-1-6537 75</page><page sequence="22">The Great Circle June Ross and Meg Travers Vol. 35, No. 2. motifs at LMR02N were unsuccessful. Two rock surface coatings of similar appearance were sampled for uranium-series dating. One sample, (LMRBR-on) directly overlay the boat motif, while the other sample, (LMRBR-off) was analysed for mineral composition. The off-art sample is composed of a mixture of amorphous silica, calcium phosphate and gypsum. The on-art sample yielded insufficient uranium and thorium for Uranium-Series dating, while the off-art sample was too contaminated with detrital material to provide a meaningful age estimate.91 Conclusions It is apparent that the history of watercraft in the Kimberley has a greater time depth than generally accepted. While uncertainty remains over the origin of the canoes and the identity of the crews depicted in the three sites in the Lower Mitchell Falls area, the weathered state of the motifs, the form of the canoes and their location adjacent to a major fresh water supply provide plausible evidence for considerable antiquity. The focus on the painting of anthropomorphic figures in earlier Kimberley art periods, and an established relative chronology provided a means to analyse the crew depicted. The stylistic analysis provides the most convincing support for an argument espousing an earlier appearance of canoes in the northwest Kimberley. Characteristic features, typical of anthropomorphic figures in the Wararrajai Gwion Period assemblage were documented on crew members suggesting that they represent local inhabitants rather than outsiders. Alternatively, artistic conventions may have prescribed the way that local artists portrayed all figures. We could speculate that if the cluster of canoes at the Lower Falls represents earlier marine incursions, the material from which the canoes were constructed such as reeds, bamboo or mangroves, may not have been available to local inhabitants. Lack of suitable material from which to construct similar canoes may explain the absence of Indigenous watercraft prior to the arrival of Macassan fishermen, as noted by early explorers and mariners visiting the northwest Kimberley coast. Dating rock art in the Kimberley remains a challenge.92 Previous OSL dating of quartz grains from a mud-wasp's nest overlaying a Gwion Figure produced a minimum age of 16,400±l,800years.93 Radiocarbon dating of calcium oxalate crusts in association with a Gwion Figure 76</page><page sequence="23">The Great Circle 'Ancient Mariners ' Vol. 35, No. 2. produced a maximum age of 3,880±110 BP.94 Wararrajai Gwion figures appear towards the end of the Gwion Period. Until a chronological sequence is established with a series of corresponding dates produced using different dating techniques, the timing of significant events in the Kimberley remains unknown. The depictions of watercraft associated with Macassan seafarers are less problematic as their origin and chronology are clearly defined. The northwest Kimberley examples lack the fine detail of those in other rock art provinces to the east. It has been argued that the intricate knowledge of the technological aspects of Macassan watercraft required in order to illustrate the boat images in such detail, demonstrates close contact and an embracing of outsiders and their new ways. The relatively few motifs depicting vessels from this era and the simplicity of their form suggests a more moderated relationship between local inhabitants and fishermen in the northwest Kimberley. The absence of depictions of crew on many of the sailing vessels supports this conclusion. After all, Macassans were visitors to the coast not settlers so there would not have been pressure on Aboriginal people to draw them into close social kinship systems. However, the inclusion of Macassan vessels as the only 'contact' motif in the rock art assemblage demonstrates their status amongst Aboriginal inhabitants. By far the most numerous watercraft motifs were simple canoes signifying the economic importance of these vessels to Aboriginal people in the recent past and the rapid adoption of their use. Harvesting of marine resources retains its importance but today the aluminium tinny takes pride of place along the shoreline adjacent to Aboriginal communities replacing the less stable wooden canoe.
