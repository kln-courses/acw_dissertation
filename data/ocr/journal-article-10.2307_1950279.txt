<plain_text><page sequence="1">DISCUSSION HERBERT A. SIMON Carnegie Institute of Technology In Mr. Perry's paper, he develops a distinction, which he considers basic, between the natural and the social sciences. This distinction he rests upon the unique role of language in social behavior, and upon what he describes as the "artificiality" of social institutions (as distinguished, presumably, from the "naturalness" of nature). From his consideration of this basic distinction, Mr. Perry concludes (1) that the methods of the natural sciences are not applicable to the social sciences, and (2) that the social sciences must make use of a par- ticular conceptual scheme-the scheme of action. In the action scheme, lan- guage functions to orient behavior to the environment, to social institutions, and to values. In this comment, I shall argue that Mr. Perry's first conclusion is incorrect, and that his second conclusion is correct-but not for the reasons he gives. Instead of developing my argument as a criticism of Mr. Perry's criticism of naturalism in the social sciences, I shall attempt to state it in a positive fashion. The "frustrated semanticists"' of whom Mr. Perry speaks discovered one very important principle which, if consistently applied, clears up much of the confusion about natural versus social science. This principle is that one must not speak of "language" but of "languages.' When I say: "It is snowing,"'1 I am speaking in a language that refers to events in the external environment. But when-I say: " 'Snow' is an English word," I am speaking in a language that refers to events in language-that is, to social events. For many purposes, various languages can be mixed in a single discourse without confusion, but a discussion of scientific methodology is not one of these purposes. In discussing the methodology of social science, we must be careful to distinguish between sentences in the scientist's language (i.e., sentences in social science), and sen- tences in the language of the society he is observing. To postulate a language of social science is to assume the existence of a scientist, employing this language, who is not (and whose statements are not) a part of the system of behavior to which this language refers. The necessity for this assumption is easily seen from the following example of a self-confirm- ing prediction. If I say, "There will be a depression in 1950," I am making a prediction, in the language of social science, about social events. But if my prediction is communicated to many other people, and if I have a reputation of infallibility, then there almost certainly will be a depression in 1950-brought about by the panic induced by the communication of my prediction. But the sentence I have just written is not in the same language as my prediction-it is in the language of a social scientist who is observing a larger social system that contains my prediction as a part. As Mr. Perry shows, language is an integral part of social institutions, and the language employed by a society embodies a mass of "commonsense" that affects and directs behavior. But a science of society must explain the phe- 407</page><page sequence="2">408 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW nomena of society, including the phenomena of language and the common- sense imbedded in language. Therefore, commonsense, far from providing the basis for social science, is not even expressed in the same language as social science. Rather, it is a part of the data with which social science must deal. Systematic ambiguity between these two languages-the common practice of using for social science the same vocabulary and rules of grammar as are used in the society we are studying-should never conceal from us the fact that two distinct languages really are involved. Hence, in methodological discussions-we are in great danger of confusion unless we assume that our social scientist is a man from Mars (or from a flying saucer), who does not communicate with the people whose behavior he is ob- serving and predicting, or alternatively, that he is a man to whose predictions other people do not pay any particular attention. In either case, we may ex- clude statements in the language of social science from the system of behavior to which these statements refer. This is an exclusion we cannot avoid, regardless of whether we accept or reject the natural science framework. Let us, for simplicity, adopt the Martian alternative. Then we must dis-- tinguish statements in Martian from statements in English. The former are propositions of social science that refer to social phenomena, including English language phenomena. Our Martian, being incurably addicted to the methodol- ogy of the natural sciences, wishes to make generalizations and predictions about the behavior of the curious people who speak English. If our Martian is wise, he will begin his investigations not with the whole society of English-speaking people, but with a particular individual. He will discover, first of all, that this individual does not really distinguish in his own language between statements about the natural environment and statements about "artificial' society. To the individual, the society in which he lives is just as much a part of his environment as are stones and trees. When he touches a bare wire, he receives a shock; when he tickles the hind leg of a mule, he receives a kick; when he raids the cookie jar, he receives a slap (commonsense regarding child psychology being quite primitive in the society our Martian is studying). Through such experiences, he learns "appropriate" ways of behaving in rela- tion to wires, mules, and parents. His ways of behaving may include "appro- priate" language behaviors (in English). He swears at the wire, says "Whoa!" to the mule, and lies to the parent. "Role playing" is one of the adjustments he makes in order to get the responses he desires from his environment, in- cluding among these responses the approval of other people. This process of socialization, as analyzed by Cooley, Meade, and others, involves nothing "unnatural" or "artificial." II You will notice that our Martian scientist is already using the action scheme -and in particular, the notion of purpose or value-in his analysis of the behavior of his subject. This does not, in itself, imply any peculiar role for language. If he were observing rats instead of men he might still find it useful</page><page sequence="3">THE SEMANTICS OF POLITICAL SCIENCE-DISCUSSION 409 to describe their behavior in terms of the purpose of obtaining cheese, the desire to avoid a shock, or the desire for the approval of a lady rat. To say that it is often convenient to use the term "purpose" in social science means no more and no less than to say that it is often convenient to use the term "force" in physics. A physical force is no more directly observable than a social purpose (and indeed, physical laws are generally capable of being trans- lated into fully teleological terms-e.g., the principles of least action and of conservation of energy). To bar from natural or social science all terms that do not refer to directly observable events is to confuse deduction with induction. All that we require of the language of a science is that its propositions, whether directly observable or not, permit us to deduce other propositions that are directly observable, and hence testable. Propositions about "purposes" and "desires" do permit such predictions and tests, and hence are not different from propositions in the natural sciences. It is very easy to test whether a rat has a desire for cheese, and even how strong this desire is in comparison with other desires. Suppose, to borrow Mr. Perry's example, our Martian wished to test whether a particular document is a "map" of a certain area. He would first examine the geometry of the design on the paper in relation to the geometry of the area, and discover certain rules of isomorphism between them. He would then con- tract with the Martian Survey Research Center to conduct an opinion survey in order to determine on what occasions English-speaking people utter the sentence, "The paper, A, is a map of the area, B." He may discover that this statement is uttered whenever A reveals the same isomorphism to B that he discovered in the relation of his piece of paper to the geographical area. He then concludes that the paper was indeed intended to be a "map." He can even discover to what extent it is an accurate "map"-i.e., to what extent the map- maker correctly interpreted the meaning of the word "map." Through all this procedure, our Martian is operating exactly like a natural scientist. When he says: "The map-maker made these marks because he was trying to make a map," this is much the same as if he said: "This apple fell because it was acted on by the force of gravity." Both propositions are tested in about the same way. I Thus far I have set forth (although not demonstrated in any rigorous fashion) three propositions: 1. The action scheme is very likely a useful scheme-perhaps the most useful-for the framework of a theory of human behavior (and indeed, of rat behavior). 2. The use of this scheme neither requires nor permits any deviation from the methodology of the natural sciences. The task of the scientist is still that of framing and testing propositions about observable events, including behavioral events and language events. The techniques of social, as of natural, science are those of model-construction, deduction, and observation. ' It should be noted that throughout this discussion the word "map" is a word in English, not in Martian.</page><page sequence="4">410 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW 3. The action scheme may be very useful for describing systems of behavior (e.g., animal behavior) where language is not involved. III If these propositions are correct, Mr. Perry is wrong in arguing that it is be- cause of language the action scheme is required in the social sciences, and that the action scheme implies some "artificiality" of social phenomena. But per- haps the artificiality of social phenomena is implied by language alone, apart from the matter of teleology. Let us examine this question next. With Mr. Perry's acute observations about the intertwining of language and institutions one cannot quarrel. It must likewise be admitted that in some sense both language and institutions are conventional-they certainly are not uniquely determined by physical or biological circumstances, except possibly in some long-term developmental sense. Yet we have seen that for a particular individual in our English speaking society, social institutions have the same reality as natural laws. Mr. Perry argues that: "There can be, strictly speaking, no science about artificial objects." Yet our Martian has been able to test propositions of the following kind: "Given a child who has had certain experiences in a society with certain mores, and given a particular situation in which the child is placed, he will behave in such and such a fashion." This is a proposition of exactly the same kind as: "Given a planetary system with particles having certain positions and masses, and given a comet having a certain position and velocity, the comet will move along such and such a path.". To be sure, in the first case we do not explain how the mores of society got to be what they are; but in the second we do not explain how the planetary system got where it is. In dach case we fail to explain why the play is what it is, but we do explain why the actor acts as he does. As a matter of fact, our predictions in social science can go much farther than the above illustration indicates. Just as in natural science we can predict for a whole system from a given (unexplained) situation to later situations, so in social science we can predict from an initial (unexplained) social state to a later state. And I would submit that the construction of such predictions, rather than the construction of generalizations which are independent of initial condi- tions, is the task of the social, as of the natural, sciences. The institutions of society appear "artificial" only when we impose on social science the meaning- less task of explaining why they are as they are without any assumptions as to what they have been in the past. Nature would appear equally artificial if we attempted to impose the same task on astronomy or geology. Mr. Perry may be quite right in asserting that the application of natural science methods to social phenomena has not yet produced much of a science. Some of us would be a little more sanguine than he about progress to date, but this is not the essential point. The real question is whether acceptance of the action scheme requires a departure from the methods of natural science, and this it does not.</page><page sequence="5">THE SEMANTICS OF POLITICAL SCIENCE-DISCUSSION 411 IV One can find many things to complain about in political science. Excessive emphasis on natural science methodology is not one of them. On the other hand, we must agree with Mr. Perry that a fruitful application of any scientific methodology to political science requires us, as political scientists, to be much more sophisticated than we have ever been about the semantic underpinning of our work. From a semantic standpoint two basic methodological reforms are needed: 1. We must learn to distinguish the various languages with which we are concerned. We must separate the commonsense that is part of our data from the propositions of our science. In particular, it is time that we maintained' consistent distinctions between political theory (i.e., scientific statements about the phenomena of politics) and the history of political thought (i.e., statements about what people have said about political theory and political ethics). 2. We must develop more explicitly the action scheme as a basic framework of analysis of behavior. We must clarify the status of such concepts as "pur- pose" in our scientific scheme by specifying the kinds of observations that will test the correctness of scientific propositions containing these concepts. Through such clarification we will in time recognize that, while social phe- nomena are teleological, social science (statements about such phenomena) is not. In conclusion I should like to add my enthusiastic endorsement to Mr. Perry's comments about the unfortunate consequences of the excessive speciali- zation of the several social sciences. Political science has probably suffered more than any other from its separation from its sister sciences, for it has inherited from its origins in history, law, and ethics an antiquated methodology that is in need of drastic reconstruction. A fuller communication with psychology and sociology in particular would save political scientists the task of rediscovering the important methodological advances that have taken place in these fields in the last generation. In those areas of political science where there has already been some effective communication-notably in the field of political behavior and public opinion-the impact of newer methods upon our field is noticeable and encouraging. Political theory, public law, and public administration need and deserve similar assistance. MAX RADIN Institute of Advanced Study Mr. Perry's study seems to be based on two key-words, "commonsense "- written as a single word and not as a hyphenated compound-and "language." Evidently these words must be examined rather than defined. It is-or should be-a semantic axiom that definition in the sense of precise delimitation, per genus et speciem, is quite impossible for any words except symbolic references to individual concrete objects.</page><page sequence="6">412 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW But since I regard both these terms as good and useful, it is highly desirable to see where they direct our thoughts and analysis. Although Mr. Perry rejects the notion that commonsense is something which gets its name from the fact that it is the common possession of most persons, this must after all be a part of what he has in mind. I take commonsense to be the conscious reaction of ordinary people to the world they know, above all to the presence in it of other persons, who form a group to which they themselves belong, as well as to the physical surroundings in which and with which they all work. And I exclude from the class of "ordinary" people in this situation those who are especially gifted or exceptionally unendowed, as well as those who ex professo have made social relations their object of interest. Common- sense is therefore the means by which ordinary persons mentally adjust them- selves to their human and non-human environment. The danger in the use of such a term is that once it is established, it tends to get invested with a precision and unified character which it can possess only to a limited degree, since the "ordinary man" is as much a fiction as the economic or the rational man, and the commonsense will vary with the individ- ual in its penumbra of connotations and indeed in a great many aspects that any particular individual will treat as important. But there will be, after all, a common core which most persons will expect to find when they think of the commonsense of others as well as of their own, that is to say, there will be a substantial group of aspects in which the social and physical world will seem alike to the people to whom commonsense may be attributed. To pragmatists, this kind of commonsense is not only knowledge but it is the only kind of knowledge, since it is as Mr. Perry says, concerned with "practice,"-and what is not so concerned, pragmatists do not regard as knowl- edge at all. But we must take care to enlarge "practice"- to include much more than bodily activity and the satisfaction of bodily needs. Commonsense takes a great many moral valuations into account and in a large number of situations will pronounce acts and results of acts to be "good" or "bad," "right" or "wrong," "desirable" or "undesirable." Polities are built on such valuations and no social'group has continuity or a qualified permanence until valuations are made and become a part of commonsense. That the penumbra of individual variations will be larger and more diverse in political matters than in other commonsense aspects of the social environment is undoubtedly true but does not change the basic character of just these value-terms. And since we are deal- ing with the "semantics of politics," they must not be disregarded because they are difficult. That commonsense operates through language and can operate through nothing else is undoubted. Mr. Perry is quite right in making "language' his second key-word and calling attention to the fact that there are other groups of symbols besides the ordinary verbal ones which make up language. There is in speaking of language, however, a danger somewhat akin to that which attends the word "commonsense." The impression might be created that language is a force by itself, something that operates independently. Mr. Perrv</page><page sequence="7">THE SEMANTICS OF POLITICAL SCIENCE-DISCUSSION 413 certainly intends no such thing. Language is not something independent, but merely the externalizing of commonsense. This results from the fact that commonsense is the adjustment of a person to an environment in which other persons are far the most important elements, elements which are essential to his living, since man as man is a social and not a solitary animal. The specific difference between man and other animals- Mr. Perry speaks of "simian" creatures-is the fact that in order to live, man must put himself in communication with his human environment and this communication is language, i.e., a system of conventional symbols, chiefly but not exclusively, verbal ones. It becomes at once apparent that we can know the character, and even the existence, of commonsense only in its external form. Persons use language not only in a commonsense effort to induce other persons to act in a certain way but also to express valuations and, if they are generally accepted, to construct institutions by means of them. But what form commonsense takes in the minds of the persons who possess it only each individual can know for himself and only if he has skill in introspection, which is a rare skill. And it is here that we discover logic, an operational method necessary for sciences of all kinds including the science of politics. That commonsense unex- pressed-let us say, "thinking"-uses logic is very doubtful. We may forego the attempt to apply any particular psychological theory or to create a new one. But it is scarcely open to question that thousands of the things of which we are ourselves conscious and which we call mental facts are presented, when they occur or before they are arranged for communication, in a form that certainly cannot be called logical. But when commonsense is externalized, that is to say, when we try to com- municate with other persons, this form must be given to it. The commonsense, as it then appears, must be rationalized. Nothing is communicable unless it "makes sense,' i.e., unless it is capable of being put in "logical" form. This does not mean that it takes the form of "logic" as logic is studied by logicians and mathematicians. They use logic as an operational device of great value for their purposes which are only in a small degree the purposes of lan- guage. But to that small degree logic is quite necessary. Communication, I have said, must "make sense." There must be no obvious contradictions. The premises under which, after the event, the justifications for action are sub- sumed, must have some general acceptance, although they might frequently fail to sustain themselves on factual examination. Whether with all this we can have a "science'` of politics, depends on what we want a science for. If we wish merely to describe the situations under which groups of men have managed to organize themselves for internal order and external defense-the bare bones of government-it is perfectly good English and in accord with commonsense, to call the result a science. And if government assumes welfare functions within a polity and seeks by combination to create the basis for what may be a world polity, this expansion merely makes the materials to be scientifically put together more diverse and more complicated.</page><page sequence="8">414 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW But if the purpose for which we want a science of politics is to relate political facts in some way to other complexes of social data like economics and sociology or to such specialized sciences as psychology, so far as the human environment is concerned, or geography or technology for the non-human part of the en- vironment, if this is the purpose of our science, we have a more difficult but by no means an insuperable task. We cannot find precise quantitative relations between sequences of human behavior, even if the non-human conditions re- main constant, as they do not remain. But in spite of all the variables for which we must allow, we can make valid statements about many sequences of be- havior and these statements can be expressed in commonsense terms. We can say that certain situations "generally", produce certain political results. That is different from saying that when we apply heat to pure distilled water at the pressure of one atmosphere at sea-level, the water will boil when the heat reaches 212 degrees, Fahrenheit. I suppose no one will doubt that the latter is a scientific statement. Our political statement may even be different in kind from our statement about water. But is is nonetheless a scientific statement and its scientific character can be denied only by begging the question. In dealing with politics as a science, all that is necessary is to avoid the always present danger of assuming that words exist independently of the phrases of which they are parts, or that all the suggestions and directions in- volved in word-groups are either invariant or precise. There is, likewise, the almost equal danger in assuming that there is no persistence whatever in se- mantic symbols, either as single words or as larger or smaller word-groups. Commonsense, both as inferred in the minds of men and as externalized in language, is not quite so chaotic as that. In these comments on Mr. Perry's paper, I have, as is apparent, attempted no detailed criticism. What I have presented here has, however, it seems to me, relevance to the problem he attacks. I offer it as a group of suggestions which do not involve any change in the results he reaches. GEORGE A. LUNDBERG University of Washington I use the title, "The Semantics of Charner Perry," for these remarks not be- cause I want to be unduly personal, but because I think the title describes what is in fact the subject of my paper and, also, I think, of Professor Perry's essay. I find his discussion very much more revealing as an example of his own seman- tic difficulties than as an analysis of the actual semantic problems frustrating the development of a science of political behavior. Accordingly, my remarks will be directed mainly at this particular presentation rather than at political science or political scientists generally. Professor Perry declares categorically that "institutions, despite figures of speech, are not mechanisms." The statement betrays one of the most funda- mental of semantic fallacies, namely, that words have intrinsic meanings which make it unpermissible for us to classify together, as similar in some ways and</page><page sequence="9">THE SEMANTICS OF POLITICAL SCIENCE-DISCUSSION 415 for some purposes of understanding phenomena, things that are in other re- spects vastly different from each other. Since Professor Perry's difficulty with this phase of semantics recurs at many other points in his paper, and since it is an illustration of the kind of crippling semantic confusion which has unneces- sarily retarded the development of the social sciences and especially political science, let us consider the above obiter dictum from a semantic viewpoint. In science it is not a question of what institutions (or anything else) are in a metaphysical sense by a priori declaration. The question is how it is scientifi- cally profitable to regard them. It is a matter of deciding experimentally in what category to classify a phenomenon in order to advance most efficiently our scientific understanding of it. What institutions (or man, society, mind, culture, invention, artifact, etc., etc.) are, is therefore to the scientist a practical question of what assumptions regarding them most effectively advance our scien- tific understanding of them. We decide on this basis whether to call them (whether they "are" !) mechanisms or not. Scientific utility is subject to demonstration because the criteria of scientific understanding reduce to certain practical tests of corroboration, predictability, or control. Until this attitude in science to- ward the adoption or rejection of categories like "mechanism" is thoroughly grasped by social scientists, they will never rid themselves of pre-scientific preconceptions regarding social phenomena, which today frustrate the devel- opment of social science. It is precisely on this basis that the word "mechanism" has been adopted both in physiology and in sociology to describe segments of behavior and se- quences of events. Professor Perry's declaration that institutions are not mech- anisms is almost a paraphrase of one of the most pious cliches in philosophy, namely, that "after all, [sic] man is not a machine." When pronounced in the right tone of voice and preferably with a rolling of the eyes heavenward, it is almost impossible to resist this fine phrase or to doubt that it partakes of the nature of eternal and self-evident truth. Yet, if we turn to any respectable re- cent treatise on physiology, we find numerous references to mechanisms of the human body without apology or implication that this is a "figurative" usage.' Physiologists have adopted the word mechanism to describe specific sequences of events because they recognize that the success of the physical and the chemi- cal sciences has consisted precisely of this: the designation of important phe- 1 Note on this subject the title as well as the content of the recent text by A. J. Carlson and V. Johnson, The Machinery of the Body (3rd ed., Chicago, 1948). See especially the section on mechanisms, pp. 4 and 5. The authors' illustrations of the fallacy of confusing (a) the evolution and utility of a system for (b) the machinery for bringing it about is wholly applicable to much writing in the social sciences. The appearance of such chapter headings as "The Decline of the Mechanistic View" (A. Einstein and L. Infeld, Evolution of Physics [New York, 19381, Ch. 2) in respectable physics books has misled many to the conclusion that we are returning to an orientation (e.g., vitalism) in vogue before the mech- anistic view developed. A little further reading will soon convince anyone of the error of that assumption. The point is that field theory and relativity instead represent much more sophisticated "mechanical" views. The same may be said for the unwarranted glee with which some theologians greet Heisenberg's principle of indeterminism.</page><page sequence="10">416 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW nomena by a careful description of the observable sequences of events, rather than by words purporting to designate utility, purpose, motive, property, being or other vitalistic terms of no determinable reference, which are imputed to the behavior by the speaker instead of being observable and subject to corrobora- tion by rigorously specified methods. In short, to call something a mechanism suggests the permissibility and, in- deed, the necessity, of further inquiry and corroboration. To ascribe the be- havior to a "purpose" or a "property" leaves nothing to investigate. It is not all "merely" a question of words but of what the words in accepted usage stand for, in terms of the concrete operations through which science tests its under- standing, in corroboration, prediction, and control. It is not true that a rose by any other name smells as sweet, as the psychologists have shown. The charac- ter of man's activities in a situation depends largely upon the kind of words and sentences in terms of which he appraises that situation-whether he attempts, for example, to influence it (a) by magical incantations or (b) by scientific methods. The only scientific importance of whether or not to call institutions mechanisms, or e.g., "group instincts," lies in the effect of one or the other usages on the scientists further inquiry. If he regards institutions as mechanisms, many questions call for in quiry and answers-inquiries of the sort that have advanced science in every field. If he regards institutions as instincts or "properties" of human groups, scientific inquiry tends to stop at that point. What has Veen said above regarding the physiologists' use of the word "mech- anism" to explain human behavior applies with equal force to the desirability of regarding social institutions as mechanisms.2 For that matter, the dictionary defines mechanism as "the arrangement or relation of parts of anything as adapted to produce an effect." Doubtless this describes the various gadgets which, in a technological culture, we most frequently think of as mechanisms. But does not this definition also describe the phenomenon social scientists aim to designate by the word institution? IFurther illustration of how the projection of Professor Perry's language structure upon the nature of phenomena affects his methods of inquiry in the social sciences may be found throughout his whole paper. For example, he elects to regard social phenomena as "artificial" as compared with the other phenom- ena of nature. He quotes iMierriam to the effect that "the organs, devices, and techniques of government are not fixed or frozen but are in a process of change and development occasioned by new needs, new problems, and new instru- ments," etc. The clear implication is that the organs, devices, and techniques of 'nature" are, in contrast, fixed and frozen! Having thus erected an entirely unwarranted (in the sense of blocking scientific understanding) dichot- omy in the phenomena of nature, he follows it with another obiter dictum to the 2 For a full statement of this position see my Foundations of Sociology (New York, 1939), Chs. 5 and 6. For a briefer and more recent statement see my paper before the AAAS, December 28, 1947, "Human Social Problems as a Type of Disequilibrium in a Biological Integration," American Sociological Review, Vol. 13, pp. 689-699 (December, 1948).</page><page sequence="11">THE SEMANTICS OF POLITICAL SCIENCE-DISCUSSION 417 effect that "there can be, strictly speaking, no science about artificial objects." Such are the real semantic muddles that have handicapped and are handi- capping the social sciences. In spite of the inhibitions mentioned, the word "mechanism" and other terms designating behavior subject to observation and corroboration are coming increasingly into usage in reference to social behavior. Thus, perhaps no one but a pedant would challenge the increasing tendency to refer, for example, to a committee as a mechanism for achieving certain ends. Doubtless the lore- language which is so highly valued in some quarters, originated in the same way except that in first selecting his terminology man drew on anthropomorphic, anthropocentric, and metaphysical sources instead of on terms drawn from a technological culture and from science. His subsequent attitude and approaches to the phenomena designated was largely influenced by the kind of terms with which he happened first to designate them, and subsequent liberation from the preconceptions created by anthropomorphic concepts has been a major problem in the history of every science. Scientists, realizing these facts regarding the nature of all language, proceed quite cavalierly either to invent entirely new terms or to select colorful ones from the folk lore (such as horsepower, candlepower, etc.), but defining them operationally in specific ways that may or may not have the slightest relation to the traditional meanings. Like Humpty Dumpty, they make their words mean what they want them to mean-neither more nor less. Thus they cir- cumvent the whole dreadful morass of traditional philosophizing simply by observing what results they get with the terms they select, as defined and used, and adapting both their words and their methods accordingly. It is a practice social scientists could profitably adopt instead of arguing whether man is a machine, whether institutions are mechanisms, whether culture and inventions are artificial, etc., etc. In so doing, it is highly likely that a great many terms drawn from the physical sciences will be adopted and, even with their present definitions, will be found applicable to social phenomena. The principle of parsimony and the constant striving of scientists for greater generality in their concepts is likely to result in bringing human social behavior and the behavior of "nature" increasingly under common concepts and laws.3 Professor Perry, however, apparently believes that only the terminology ordained by folk lore to designate social behavior is suitable or useful for this purpose, because "the distinctions and preconceptions of common sense have quickly reim- 3 See in this connection the opinion of a physicist, Lancelot Law Whyte, "Scientific Thought in the Coming Ages," Harper's Magazine, Vol. 197 (November, 1948). "It is not possible to set out the evidence here, but there are many signs that the coming period may see the establishment of a single unified science covering the inorganic and organic realms and also providing the valid scientific approach to the subject matter of psychology and possibly also of sociology." For illustrations, see S. C. Dodd, Dimensions of Society (New York, 1942), pp. 742-743 and J. Q.

Zipf, Human Behavior and the Principle of Least Effort (Boston, 1949), esp. Part 2.</page><page sequence="12">418 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW posed themselves even when mutilated by a strained terminology." Doubt- less the physicists had the same trouble with terms, such as horsepower and candlepower, to begin with. But it may be noted that today the preconcep- tions of common sense have been supplanted even in folk lore by the scientific meaning of these terms. Except for the fact that the whole burden of Professor Perry's paper is that the phenomenon of language behavior is not only unique but that it apparently precludes the application of the methods of natural science to the study of social phenomena I should not, of course, devote so much space to his mere statement that institutions are not mechanisms. I refer to that statement at length only because it seems to me to typify the fallacy and the confusion that underlies his whole paper. For other examples, consider the following: "Institutions are not mechanisms; they are resultants of human behavior." Are not the mechan- isms of the solar system or of digestion also "resultants" of behavior? (Actually, of course, the behavior, viewed in a certain sequential way is, in science, the referent of the word "mechanism.") Another illustration: "Politics is obviously mostly a matter of talk." The implication is that therefore it is not subject to scientific study. And again: "Justice is not a simian activity merely more efficiently performed through a division of labor mediated by language." This appears to be important only because it has previously been decreed by Pro- fessor Perry that simian chatter is subject to scientific study as a natural phe- nomenon, whereas sophisticated language behavior apparently is not. The basic difficulty in Professor Perry's analysis is that he commits the se- mantic fallacy of assuming that the barriers erected by his language represent, in fact, barriers in nature; that, as a result, the phenomena of nature are divided into compartments corresponding to the language structure in which much current philosophy and social science happens to be carried on; and that we must behave toward nature according to this language structure rather than by modifying our language and our abstractions to serve the ends we seek. This attitude is widespread in the social sciences in spite of the plain fact of history that scientific triumphs have come largely through the abandonment of traditional barriers erected by folk language. Instead, scientists have pros- pered by recognizing that the unique data of different fields are subsumable under more and more general abstractions and linguistic structures. As Whitehead has said, "A civilization which cannot burst through its current abstractions is doomed to sterility after a very limited period of progress.'' It would be impossible to find a better illustration of the principle than in most philosophy and social science. Professor Perry finds language and cultural phenomena "artificial," the result of "invention," with the latter ones so based on the earlier ones that the relation of the result to "nature" or to "human nature," is extremely tenuous. To be sure, all this is "learned," "acquired," "external," etc. But except for the language forms in terms of which we are accustomed to dichotomize and discuss these phenomena, how are they any less natural processes evolving, changing, developing, growing in environment than the mechanisms of breath-</page><page sequence="13">THE SEMANTICS OF POLITICAL SCIENCE-DISCUSSION 419 ing, digestion, etc? Do these mechanisms and functions have a determinable natural history (and, for that matter, a probable future course of development) or are they still mysterious "instincts," ''properties," or "essences" not to be further inquired into? In short, does not the word "invention" stand for a social process or develop- ment as observable, and describable as osmosis, digestion, or maturation? "Social techniques," says Professor Perry, "are not tools which one picks up and lays down as one might a hammer." I don't know what he means by a social technique, how literally he wants his figure to be taken, and, in any case, the significance of his illustration. The difference, he implies, is that social tech- niques are "integral with the behavior in which they function.i' In what sense is a hammer not integral with the behavior in which it functions (i.e., in a ham- mering situation)? How is the hammer "external" to this situation? Why is it not part of the "essential stuff or structure of the behavior situation about which we are talking'"'? Is it a social technique for me to communicate to a student that the square root of 300 is 17.3205081? If so, is the table of squares which I pick up and lay down and by means of which I accomplish the communica- tion sufficiently "like a hammer" for purposes of the present discussion? Professor Perry concludes quite correctly that language "and the various systems of symbols more or less distinctly dependent on language are not only the basic technique but even today the framework upon which the super- structure of society is supported." My question is, what of it? Is not this language behavior and its results and residues in all forms of culture, material and "spiritual," a wholly natural phenomenon subject to study by the same general methods as the rest of the natural universe of which it is surely a part? Having erected an unnecessary linguistic barrier between civilization and nature by calling the former artificial, the difficulties with which Professor Perry labors throughout the rest of his paper doubtless follow. He has correctly recognized that while both the chatter of monkeys and the discussion of social scientists are doubtless functional, the latter is far more complex and far-reach- ing in its cultural ramifications, as represented by our institutions and culture generally. In this connection, also, he correctly finds that culture (such as sci- ence and social institutions) is "radically conditioned by systems of language and symbols" and that language, in turn, is "a system of functions, coincident with the operation of various parts of civilization." This "double fact," he says, "has baffled many social scientists and semanticists." Alas, yes; but why? What is more common in scientific thinking than the fact of interaction in the parts of a situation? I leave to the semanticists the pleasure of further comment on Professor Perry's remark that in their alleged attempt to "construct an isolable system of denotable objects semanticists exhaust themselves in con- structing a barbarous terminology for talking about some of the accidental [?] and superficial[?] aspects of language" (brackets mine). I suppose he refers to symbolic logic and new mathematical systems. The very least that the semanti- cists can retort is that, if we accept the dictionary's definition of "barbarous" as meaning pertaining to or like a barbarian, then an objective examination of</page><page sequence="14">420 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW the case will probably reveal that it is Professor Perry's terminology rather than that of the semanticists that most closely resembles the language of bar- barians. Professor Perry is surely right when he emphasizes the vast quantity and importance of common sense knowledge couched in common sense language. It is true, as he says, that "commonsense was formed in relation to and for the guidance of practice. Its distinctions and terms reflect the purpose, needs, and exigencies of action.' Social scientists should remember that the advancement of the other sciences has been characterized by the abandonment of the primi- tive method of explaining their phenomena in terms of needs and purposes. Having established that a great deal of the social sciences has to do with lan- guage behavior, Professor Perry notes that "the subject matter of the natural sciences does not include language or behavior built on language." I suppose that conclusion inevitably follows as long as he has arbitrarily excluded social behavior as a proper subject matter for natural science. This superstitious atti- tude toward language which has inhibited social scientists from dealing with it as merely another phenomenon of nature has been a vast detriment to the development of social science. Regarding Professor Perry's statement that "so far as I know there have been no important contributions in the field [social science] resulting from the application of scientific method," there is no disputing his privilege to so ap- praise the situation. Nevertheless, this is an amazing statement even as quali- fied by the phrase "as far as I know." I do not know what are Professor Perry's criteria of important contributions or to what extent his statement is a con- sidered one based on familiarity with what has in fact occurred in the social sciences in the last thirty years. He is entitled to his judgment. I shall, therefore, merely register my disagreement, and in support thereof mention only one recent survey of the subject in fairly popular form, which is by no means the full story nor does it include many of the choicest exhibits. I refer to Stuart Chase's recent volume, The Proper Study of Mankind.4 Again, I do not know what Professor Perry's notion of scientific work may be. But at least it may be said that physical scientists of unquestioned repute have recently stated that on the basis of actual performance, there appears to be no reason or barrier to the achievement of strictly scientific results through the proper study of the subject matter which Professor Perry finds beyond the reach of such methods.5 Finally, it may be pointed out that, if it is a test of science to be able to predict with reliability the important political behavior of millions of people, then such social science has indubitably appeared in the last fifteen years. Nor is that fact altered by the journalistic comments of political scientists and others about other shortcomings of the new methods. With Professor Perry's designation of the present situation in political science as well as in the other social sciences as a bad case of schizophrenia, I am in- clined to agree. It corresponds in fact with the diagnosis which I have elabo- I (New York, 1948). 5 See Science, Vol. 111, p. 500 (May 5, 1950).</page><page sequence="15">THE SEMANTICS OF POLITICAL SCIENCE-DISCUSSION 421 rated in Can Science Save Us?6 The remedy, however, I have argued, seems to me to be to go over to the scientific orientation in our approach to the social as well as to physical problems. Professor Perry deplores this. He says "it inhibits the systematic exploitation of the common sense conceptual scheme." But is it not the continued exploitation of this common sense conceptual scheme in the social field while and after the physical sciences have abandoned it, which is responsible for the schizophrenia he correctly diagnoses? The psychiatrist may agree with Professor Perry that contemporary culture, of which science is a major component, being incompatible with the infantile and fantastic orientation of many a common sense conceptualization is, in fact, the cause of his patient's schizophrenia. But the practical situation is such that the treatment, nevertheless, consists of an attempt to reorient the patient to this culture with which he must come to grips, rather than to attempt to re- furbish the culture to conform to the patient's primitive and pre-scientific orientation. As Professor Perry correctly says, "to many people who have be- come habituated to science, the propositions of political theory have a char- acter of unreality and futility that bars out any serious interest in their dis- cussion." The fact that scientists "bar out serious interest" in the "unreality" of current political theory, indicates that they have either been cured from (or have never suffered) the schizophrenia which Professor Perry correctly detects in those who try to operate according to (a) the orientations of modern science in their adjustment to the physical world and according to (b) the orientation of Plato and Aristotle in relation to their social world. Unless we contemplate the abandonment of the whole structure of modern science and a return to Aristotle also in physical science, the only cure for Professor Perry's schizophrenics is to adopt the orientation of modern natural science also for the social world. The first step in the therapy is to find out what the methods of natural science are. For such has been the result of our absurd reliance on the "humanities," and especially on the definition of the humanities which excludes modern science from them, that the overwhelming majority of college graduates have no adequate grasp whatever of what natural science and scientific methods are. The unfortunate divorce of the social sciences and the humanities which Professor Perry mentions is only a byproduct of a far more unfortunate divorce, namely, that between humanities and science. As a result, people apparently think that Hume represents modern science. Herein lies the main source of the schizophrenia correctly discerned by Professor Perry. He obviously does not share my idea as to the remedy, however. He speaks vaguely of "the confused ideal of a value-free social science."7 I certainly agree with Professor Perry that "any projected study of society which disregards the intricate ways in which behavior is structured by linguistic 6 (New York, 1947). See especially Ch. 1. 7 I have dealt with that subject in a separate paper, "Alleged Obstacles to Social Science," Scientific Monthly, Vol. 70, pp. 299-305 (May, 1950). See also "Human Values- A Research Program," forthcoming in Research Studies of the State College of Washington (September, 1950). (Mimeographed copies available from author.)</page><page sequence="16">422 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW functions will surely be vain and empty."- But his further statement on this subject seems to me most dubious: "First and foremost the universe of dis- course of language and common sense, however subjective and fictitious its teleological categories may seem, is certainly real, since it is a counterpart of society and civilization, which are certainly actual." If I understand this state- ment, it seems to assert the grossly fallacious notion that because there are words in folk language, there must be referents in nature for these words. It is a widespread but a thoroughly mischievous semantic error. I have no objec- tion to his further statement objecting to the idea that "there is no knowledge except that which runs in terms of concepts of natural science in non-teleologi- cal categories in terms of 'colorless, impersonal sequences of cause and effect'." I would merely distinguish scientific knowledge which, as a matter of definition, has this character, from other knowledge which falls short of these character- istics. There are many things in Professor Perry'Ss paper which I have not com- mented upon and to which I have no objection. His suggestion that perhaps political science should devote itself to the art of public administration, analogously to the medical profession, engineering, or social work, rather than strive for independent status as a science, is an idea which I also advocated in a paper at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Associa- tion in 1948. Even in this role political scientists need to be on their guard against the kind of semantic fallacies I have discussed elsewhere.8 In any event, the importance of the semantic aspect of the social sciences at present cannot be overestimated. I am not sure I understand exactly what Professor Perry means when he says, "social knowledge does not lie unborn, awaiting the mid- wifery of a new conceptual system." But I would call his attention to the follow- ing views on the subject by a person who speaks with some authority regarding the role of concepts in science: "The only justification for our concepts and system of concepts is that they serve to represent the complex of our experi- ences; beyond this they have no legitimacy. I am convinced that the philoso- phers have had a harmful effect upon the progress of scientific thinking in re- moving certain fundamental concepts from the domain of empiricism, where they are under our control, to the intangible heights of the a priori.9 HAROLD D. LASSWELL Yale University No useful purpose is served by trying to establish uniformity of usage for a word of such importance in modern civilization as "science." Not long ago it was common to regard as science any systematic body of descriptive rather than "intuitive" or "supernatural" knowledge. In this sense "political science' continues to be a well-chosen name for the empirical study of power and its institutions. More recently many specialized and narrowed definitions of science have been proposed, usually modelled upon some of the more complex and suc- cessful branches of physical science. Science comes to mean a body of descrip- 8 "Some Views on Semantics in International Relations," American Perspective, Vol. 2 (June, 1948), reprinted in Etc.: A Review of General Semantics, Vol. 6 (Summer, 1949). 9 A. Einstein, The Meaning of Relativity (Princeton, 1945), p. 2.</page><page sequence="17">THE SEMANTICS OF POLITICAL SCIENCE-DISCUSSION 423 tive propositions which are not at once obvious to commonsense, and which depend upon rigorously constructed theoretical models which are verified by the data assembled by special procedures of observation. A"perfectionist" definition can be used to assert roundly that some of the physical or social sciences which are often called sciences are not "really" sciences. The restric- tions that can be made to qualify nuclear physics as a science may exclude plant and animal ecology. And what of it? Is the implication that they cannot become more scientific, even in the "perfectionist" sense? I doubt whether the history of past guessing about the future of knowledge gives us much confidence in contemporary prophets or that much energy can usefully be expended on per- fectionist definitions. So far as political science is concerned Mr. Perry, for instance, apparently has some doubts because Aristotle would not be startled by present results in the field. Although I do not accept the idea that shocking Aristotle is a valid criterion of attainment in political science, I think a Rip van Aristotle would look with warm approval at many of the methods and findings of modern re- search into political personality and perspective. His broad experience in em- pirical inquiry would probably render him peculiarly alert to advances in proce- dures of observation, no less than findings. The following additional remarks are numbered solely for convenience of reference. 1. It needs to be more generally recognized that the most important generali- zations of political science relate to contexts which are rather circumscribed in time and place. We can dispense with the truistic statements that sometimes pass for the universal laws.' (or hypotheses) of all cultures, classes, crises and forms of personality. It is more important to know the interdependencies which charac- terize voting responses, for example, in contemporary American civilization. 2. Many if not all of our generalizations need to be "kept up to date" by appropriate institutions for the self-observation of society. As the context changes, personal strategies connected with decision change. Hence the relations which have been found to hold true in the past between income and voting may be modified in the future. Our modes of self-observation must be- on the alert for such significant shifts of context. 3. In the immediate future it is probable that political scientists can improve their results by paying more attention to the construction of theoretical models. We now know that there are examples of "oligarchical" and of anti-oligarchi- cal tendencies in mass parties. Further advance depends upon improving the theoretical models provided by Roberto Michels, perhaps transforming them into "cycle" models in which the significant factors working for and against concentration of power are revised. Many other cyclical models would be valuable aids to the unifying of scat- tered observations on political behavior. One example is the "expansion-purge- expansion" cycle of single party systems. Another is the "reform-relapse- ref orm" cycle so often noted in American municipal affairs. It is not a question of a spurious "law of the pendulum," but of discovering by research the component factors sufficient to account for deviations from</page><page sequence="18">424 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW and restorations of a given pattern of political equilibrium. Cycle models are especially helpful in revealing structural changes, and in contributing to im- proved "trend models." (This has been convincingly shown in modern work on business fluctuations, as reviewed in the volumes of Wesley C. Mitchell or Joseph A. Schumpeter.) 4. Among the theoretical models which look promising for political science is the "impact model." An impact model would be the equivalent in political science of the "input- output" models which Leontief and associates have worked out for American industry. Each industry is considered as receiving economic inputs from other industries and sending economic outputs to other industries. When these connections are understood, it is possible to trace the effect of a specific innova- tion-such as increased use of oil by the railroad industry-through the entire economy. An agency of government, or a group, is always making political impacts upon other agencies or groups, and receiving impacts in turn. During a given period agency A may reduce the influence of B by cutting appropriations, by curtailing authority, by rejecting policy proposals, by criticizing in public; meanwhile agency A may be suffering similar treatment from C. It is possible to supplement the picture of our economy with a detailed and verified model of the polity. 5. Attention needs to be given to newly developed models of the decision making process. The mathematician von Neumann and the economist Morgenstern collabo- rated in 1944 in applying game theory to the study of choice. This is the first mathematically well-developed theory of rational judgment and confronts the political scientist with the problem of determining whether the terms used in the mathematical notation can be given operational meaning in the situations relevant to political science. The von Neumann-Morgenstern theory can be modified in order to "ex- plain" choices as well as to advise on "rational" decisions. The votes of elector- ates, legislators, administrative bodies and courts may be accounted for by allowing for various degrees of true, false and doubtful information; by permit- ting several values to be demanded; and by allowing some demands to be rather vaguely formulated under postulated conditions of expectation. 6. From the point of view of theory and data-gathering political science can be improved by the more skillful employment of teams in the conduct of research. The modern tools of theory building and observation are so complicated that scholarly Robinson Crusoes are often actual drags on the growth of knowl- edge. We need more, rather than fewer, experiments in joint investigation be- tween mathematicians, economists, sociologists, geographers, psychologists, anthropologists and political scientists. Consider how field interviews can be more effectively handled by joint effort. It is unnecessary for the field interviewer to be a trained psychiatrist or test psychologist if he has the benefit of advice and aid from these specialists while his work is planned and executed. By "interviewing the interviewer" it is pos-</page><page sequence="19">THE SEMANTICS OF POLITICAL SCIENCE-DISCUSSION 425 sible to sensitize the field worker to many items of behavior that he would other- wise ignore. A trusted field worker can often obtain the consent of his subjects to take a test, provided that he administers it. It has often been pointed out that the work now done in scattered fashion at many colleges and universities by political scientists could be more effectively performed if some of it, at least, were voluntarily fitted into a common program. This could be done through a national office, such as the REVIEW. Many surveys of opinion, personnel and impact relations-whether cyclical or not-could be made more meaningful for science and policy in this way. It is often inexpedient for local scholars to study and make public major facts about local politics. This difficulty can be largely overcome by agreements which enable a political scientist based on Chicago to study Los Angeles, and a political scientist based on Los Angeles to study Chicago. (The same point applies across frontiers, like Mexico City and Washington.) 7. In the selection of research problems, it is important to take the major policy issues of our epoch into consideration. Several sciences of politics are possible, including a science of democracy, and a science of pacific relations. No problem of objectivity need arise, since scientific objectivity refers to the use of the tools and not to the preferences of the observer about choice of topic. Among the urgent questions are: How can the prospects of peace be improved in a bipolar pattern of world politics? How can the likelihood of cooperation be increased under such conditions? Under crisis conditions how can the influ- ence of civilian agencies and policies be sustained? How can the influence of political police be kept at a minimum in such a continuing crisis? What dis- closures endanger national security, and how can secrecy be restricted to such matters? 8. As theory and procedures are improved many of our predictions will become more trustworthy. Already we do rather well in predicting many kinds of political phenomena; so well, in fact, that failure brings consternation. 9. But the ideal aim of scientific work in political affairs is not prediction but freedom. The ultimate aim of scientific generalizations about politics is to increase the indeterminacy of important political judgments. Consider the following: Assume that research on personnel selection reveals a tendency on the part of top administrators to choose as assistants and successors persons who are calm, conciliatory, but uninterested in substantive policy. If this is not brought to general notice, the tendency may continue. But if the findings are adver- tised, the resulting insight may modify future selection policy. The policy may thus be evaluated (and rejected) as inconsistent with the goal values of a democratic society. Ideally our generalizations increase freedom of choice by revealing compul- sive rigidities which have determined choices in the past, and which may now be modified through insight. Hence, the ultimate aim of discovering past deter- minacies is to increase the indeterminacy of the future among all who have access to the findings.</page></plain_text>
