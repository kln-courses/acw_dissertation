<plain_text><page sequence="1">339 for typological abstraction and to sever links between mystical experience and morality, it appears more likely that theology plays a constitutive role within the established mystical traditions. It is also probable that being a certain kind of person is as important within these traditions as having enjoyed enlightenment experiences. How mystical experiences might have cognitive value is better examined within the theological and ethical contexts within which they occur than by abstracting mystical experiences from their contexts. JOHN Y. FENTON Emory University Five Mountains: The Rinzai Zen Monastic Institution in Medieval Japan. By Martin Collcutt. Cambridge, Massachusetts, and London: Harvard University Press, 1981. Pp. xxi + 399. $20.00. Although the essence of Zen enlightenment is the transhistorical duplication of the eternal moment of Sakyamuni's awakening, the success of Zen as the dominant religious insti- tution of medieval Japan was not necessarily based on its spiritual attractiveness in an age when alternative means of salvation, particularly Tendai and various Pure Land prac- tices, were well-established and proliferating. Rather, as Martin Collcutt argues in Five Mountains, the phenomenal growth of the Rinzai "five mountains" (gozan) monastic network, centered first in Kamakura and then in Kyoto, from the later twelfth through the fifteenth centuries seemed to depend largely on the elite but pervasive patronage of the Hojo regents and Ashikaga shoguns as well as the shrewd estate management policies of key monastic abbots. The leaders of the warrior government (bakufu), he carefully illustrates, were not interested in the attainment of Buddhist Dharma but sought to gain a level of cultural prestige, otherwise unavailable, through a fiscal and organizational association with Zen monks, who were the primary transmitters of the extraordinary literary and artistic accomplishments of Sung China. As the Bakufu itself rapidly declined after the Onin War (1467-1477), precipitating a long and intense era of civil strife, the gozan system quickly broke up; Rinzai Zen survived, but in a splintered and less vibrant form. Collcutt focuses exclusively on the history of Zen's rise as an institution in order to compensate for what he feels is the deficiency of the vast majority of previous studies which have stressed only its abstract and theoretical developments, as if Zen were cut off from actual circumstances. "Readers seeking an understanding of Zen enlightenment or of the essence of Zen-related aesthetics are unlikely to find it here," he insists. "They should, however, gain some insight into the importance that Zen monks have always attached to the disciplined organization of monastic life and the careful management of resources in sustaining an environment conducive to the monk's striving for enlighten- ment" (p. xx). Within the limits he sets, Collcutt is successful in highlighting Zen's unique role in the long-range social-historical conflict between the fading Heian cultural world of the aesthete and the emerging warrior society, which yearned for-and apparently evaluated itself in terms of-the respect it gained from its victims. His detailed examination of the</page><page sequence="2">340 Book Reviews motives and maneuverings of particular patrons and of the landholding practices and hierarchical structure of the main gozan temples makes clear how and why Zen became so firmly established among the warrior class. Collcutt lucidly reconstructs the economic base of the Engakuji (Kamakura) and Nanzenji (Kyoto) temples in addition to Daitokuji temple (one of the leading non-gozan temples known for its strict enforcement of the monastic code which gained prominence after the decline of the "five mountains" network). In addition, Collcutt's analysis of the temple ground-plan and building lay-out and its contrast with that of the other sects is helpful in bringing to light the life of daily training in medieval Zen and its influence on modern practice. An interesting point is how the gozan temples generally followed Dogen's anthropomorphic conception of the Zen monastery with the Dharma hall as the head and the Buddha hall and gate as the body forming the central axis, and the monk's hall and latrine along with the dining hall and bathhouse constituting the right and left limbs, respectively. The difficulty with Collcutt's approach, however, is that its appeal may be rather limited at this stage of Zen studies when so little has been translated or discussed concerning the history of the ideas, literature or art of the gozan period. Collcutt gives us no information about and-more significantly-no sense of the creative power and meaning of the tremendously rich developments of gozan bungaku (poetry and prose written in Chinese) and monochromatic painting. The question of whether the flourishing of Zen culture came at the expense of its religious impact or enhanced it is left untouched. Thus, Five Mountains represents a signal indicating how much of Zen's cultural legacy we are still missing, but it will perhaps not be fully appreciated until this material becomes available.
