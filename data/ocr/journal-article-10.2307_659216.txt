<plain_text><page sequence="1">PERIODICAL LITERATURE CONDUCTED BY DR ALEXANDER F. CHAMBERLAIN GENERAL Anthony (R.) Modifications musculaires consecutives A des variations osseuses d'origine congenitale ou traumatique chez un renard. (Bull. et Mum. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1901, ve S., II, 490- 505.) Treats, with 4 figures, of defective development of the distal extremity of the fifth digit (right forefoot) and short- ening of the free portion of the calca- neum (left forefoot) in a fox, and their relation to the morphogeny of the mus- cles in general. The author thinks that a muscle may increase its power by augmenting the quality of its con- tractile substance without varying its volume. The multiplication of the constitutive fibers of the muscle and not the increase of each in volume may explain the augmentation of muscular volume in athletes, etc. The modifi- cations of volume due to certain patho- logical conditions are also briefly considered. In the discussion follow- ing, F. Regnault pointed out that a weight-lifter, a disk-thrower, etc., have larger muscles than a laborer,-they can perform a larger amount of work in a unit of time, but are incapable of accomplishing the same number of kilogrammeters in a day; dock-labor- ers, navvies, etc., whose muscles are not so thick, accomplish an enormous number of kilogrammeters in a day, but cannot make suddenly a considera- ble effort; the best laborers for works of fatigue are poor wrestlers and easily thrown; the leg of the bicyclist is not so developed as that of the professional danseuse. The effect of modern "gymnastic" systems upon the mus- cles and the health of the human sub- ject generally (the authors do not consider this kind of exercise favorably) is to be discussed in a forthcoming book by M. Regnault and M. Pag&amp;s. Azoulay (Dr) Le musee phonograph- ique de la Societe d'Anthropologie. (Ibid., 327-330.) Brief account of re- cent work for the Phonographic Mu- seum. There are now 331 phonograms collected for and maintained by the Museum, besides a set of 55 others (16 relate to Chinese dialects; the rest to Chinese music) given by Sir Robert Hart and his agent at Paris. In Eu- rope 22 languages and dialects are rep- resented, in Asia 20, in Africa 33, in America 2, in Oceania I. See also 436-439. Bateson (W.) Heredity, differentia- tion, and other conceptions of biology, etc. (Proc. R. Soc., Lond., 1901, LXIX, 193-205.) A criticism of Pro- fessor K. Pearson's recent discussion of homotyposis. Mr Bateson holds that " the resemblance we call heredity may be a special case of the phenomenon of symmetry." Much of Professor Pear- son's work relates to normality rather than to evolution. Beeton (Mary) and Pearson (K.) On the inheritance of the duration of life, and on the intensity of natural selection in man. (Biometrika, London, 19Ol, I, 50-89.) This statistical discussion, with 8 curves and 25 tables, leads to the following among other conclusions: That the elder members of a family live sensibly longer than the young. That the expectation of life is seriously modified by either the ages of death of their relatives or their present ages. The expectation of widowhood must be based not only on the present age of the husband, or on the age of relatives, but on the age at death of children. Inheritance is stronger in members of the same sex. The daughter seems to be more closely related in duration of life to her parents than the son. Women are sensibly more variable in their age at death than men. With a given environment individuals having certain constitutions are fitter to sur- vive than others. Natural selection is manifestly at work in man, and is a factor in 50 to 80 per cent. of deaths. 309</page><page sequence="2">310 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 4, 1902 Bellucci (G.) Collezione paletnologica ed etnologica Bellucci in Perugia. (Arch. p. I'Antrop., Firenze, 1901, xxxI, 299-312.) Account of origin, development, and present condition of the Bellucci palethnological and ethno- logical collection at Perugia. The collection consists of a geological-pale- ontological, a palethnological, and a palethnographical-ethnographical sec- tion, and contains altogether some 30,- ooospecimens. The first section consists of specimens of rocks and fossils found in deposits where evidences of human industry were discovered. The second (the richest) consists chiefly of speci- mens from the various prehistoric peri- ods, from various parts of Italia(Umbria especially). The third section com- prises besides the well-known collec- tions of ancient and modern Italian amulets (and many others from all over the world) a collection of ancient and modern Italian ex-voti and donaria. A "bibliographic note" on pages 311- 312 gives the titles of 32 publications by the author relating to his collection and to the ethnology of Umbria. Boas (F.) The relations between the vari- ability of organisms and that of their constituent elements. (Science, N. Y., 1902, N. S., XV, 1-5.) General discus- sion. The author concludes that " the problem of variability may be treated by a study of the variability and of the correlations of the constituent elements of organisms. The study of physiolog- ical and pathological variations that elu- cidate correlations will, therefore, be a most powerful factor in the discussion of the problem of variability." This view is not far from that of Virchow, who looks for the clue for the problems of variability in the study of cellular variation. Cabibbe (G.) Il processo postglenoideo nei cranii di normali, alienati, criminali in rapporto a quello dei varii ordini di mammiferi. (Anat. Anz. Jena, 19Ol, xx, 81-95.) Comparative study, with 8 text-figures, of the post-glenoid pro- cess in man and other mammals. It is evidently, the author thinks, an anomaly of degenerative significance,- more common in criminals and the men- tally and physically abnormal; also more common in men than in women, and in adults than in the young. Daffner (F.) Anthropologische Beitr~ge zur Kenntnis der Gesichtsbildung. (Arch. f. Anthr., Brnschwg., Iqoi, XXVII, 337-364.) Treats with consid- erable detail (and resumes of various in- vestigations) of the development and growth of the face in general and of its various elements in particular,--frontal bone, malar bones, upper and lower jawbones, nasal bones, ear, etc.,-from birth onwards. Daffner agrees with Holl in thinking that the beauty and ugliness of the human face are condi- tioned in the first place by its bony parts. The soft parts may give a tem- porary beauty to an ugly countenance, which years or diseases soon destroy. The bony structure, on the other hand, may cause the face to retain its beauty, even in old age. Dwight (T.) Os intercuneiforme tarsi, Os paracuneiforme tarsi, Calcaneus sec- undarius. (Anat. Anz., Jena, 1902, XX, 465-472.) Treats, with 3 text-figures, of certain peculiarities of the bony struc- ture of the foot. The intercuneiform and paracuneiform bones are thought to be new, also the other peculiarity noted. Fischer (E.) Zur Kenntnis des Primor- dialcraniums der Affen. (Ibid., 410o- 417.) Gives results of study of an embryonal skull of a Cercopithecus cyno- molgus, with comparison of human em- bryonal skull. Dr Fisher agrees with Schwalbe in holding that the protype of ape and man had a broad interorbital septum. Galton (F.) The possible improvement of the human breed under existing con- ditions of law and sentiment. (Pop. Sci. Mo., N. Y., 1902, LX, 218-233.) Among the topics briefly discussed are : Human variety, distribution of qualities in a nation, comparison of the normal classes with those of Mr Booth, worth of children, descent of qualities in a population (the standard scheme of de- scent is given on page 224), economy of effort, marriage of like to like, diplomas, correlation between promise in youth and subsequent performance (this has never been properly investigated), aug- mentation of favored stock, profit and loss, existing activities, prospects. The author holds, among other things, that "' the brains of the nation lie in the higher of our classes. If such people as would be classed w or x could be distinguished as children and procur- able by money in order to be reared as Englishmen, it would be a cheap bar-</page><page sequence="3">PERIODICAL LITERATURE 311 Galton-Continued. gain for the nation to buy them at the rate of many hundred or some thousands of pounds per head."-Farr's estimate of the value of an Essex laborer's baby was /5 ; Galton estimates the value of his x-class baby as thousands of pounds. Again: " The great gain that England received through the immigration of the Huguenots would be insignificant to what she would derive from an annual addition of a few hundred children of the classes w and x." But such argu- ments are not as valid as they seem. The segregation of habitual criminals and the denial to them of opportunities for reproduction are favored by Galton. Marriage-diplomas, and social pressure to make the best marry the best, the increase of voluntary and public activi- ties to such end, etc., are also advo- cated. See also Nature, London, 1901, LXIV, 659-665. Gaudry (A.) Sur la similitude des dents de l'homme et de quelques animaux. (Anthropologie, Paris, I9or, xII, 513- 525.) Continued from XII, 93-10o2. Dis- cusses, with 18 text-figures, the dental peculiarities of several species of anth- ropoids in relation to those of the lower and higher races of man. The author believes that "in their dentition the anthropomorphic apes differ less from the quadrupeds of the dawn of the terti- ary era than they do from other animals of the present time." Moreover, we " must admit that we do not yet know whence have come the animals nearest to man." Giglioli (E. H.) Materiali per lo studio della "Eta della pietra" dai tempi preistorici all'epoca attuale [orignie e sviluppo della mia collezione]. (Arch. p. l'Antrop., Firenze, 19o0, xxxI, 19- 264.) In this elaborate descriptive ar- ticle, with 57 text-figures of specimens, Dr Giglioli gives an account (according to geographical divisions) of his valua- ble collection illustrating the Stone age from prehistoric times down to the present day. The nucleus of the Gig- lioli collections was some weapons, etc., from the Kweiying of Formosa, given the author while a student under Huxley in London in 1863, but the special collection now under considera- tion was begun in 1883. Europe is represented chiefly by prehistoric im- plements and by a series of modern stone implements still in use. Asia is fairly well represented considering the general scarcity of Asiatic lithic imple- ments in museums. From Africa there are nearly I,ooo specimens. The chief part of the article is devoted to Austral- asia (Australia, Tasmania, Micronesia, Melanesia, Papuasia, Polynesia) and America, the former taking up pages 41-143 and the latter pages 143-262. The part of the collection relating to America is particularly rich and im- portant. Guyot (Y.) Des caractbres de l''volu- tion et de la regression des soci'tes. (Bull. et Mum. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 19o01, ve s., II, 541-558.) Gen- eral discussion of the progressive and regressive characters of human socie- ties. Among the topics treated are: Definition of evolution, primitive peo- ples, the physical milieu, the social milieu, subjective tyrannies, survivals, miseoneism. According to the author: When man is content to adapt himself to his environment, he stagnates; when he adapts his environment to his needs he is perfectible. The less he is a slave of his environment and the more he is able to transform it, the more advanced is man in evolution. The history of human progress is the study of the transformations of the physical and the social environments. The degree of civilization may be measured by the independence enjoyed by woman and the respect which she inspires. Evo- lution means the predominance of ob- jective over subjective conceptions. Ancient culture was stratified, modern civilization is fluid. Altogether, evo- lution is in proportion to man's ability to transform his intellectual, moral, and social milieu as well as his physical. Helm (0.) Chemische Untersuchung von Bernstein-Perlen aus alten Tempel- Ruinen Babyloniens und aus Gribern Italiens, sowie Verfahren zur Bestim- mung der Bernsteinsiure im Bernstein. (Verh. d. Berl. Ges. f. Anthr., 19o0, 400-403.) Gives the results of the chemical examination of two amber beads from Nippur, one also from Poggio alla Guardia (Vetulonia) in Etruria and another from the necropo- lis of Novilara near Pesaro (Pisaurum) in Umbria, together with the nature of the process employed. The results of the examination of ten other beads and articles of amber from various parts of Italy, received some time previously,</page><page sequence="4">3I2 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 4, 1902 Helm-Continued. are also given. The Babylonian beads seem to be of succinite or real amber, likewise also those from Italy. Herman (O.) Die Fingigkeit der Fisch- zaune und Fischreusen. (Mitth. d. anthrop. Ges. in Wien, 19go, xxxI, 38-51.) Discusses, with 23 text-fig- ures, the form and construction of fish- traps, fish-weirs, etc., with respect to their catching power and the way the fish come in to be kept prisoners. The most primitive fish-weir, the author thinks, is the rdczvejsze of the Mag- yars (used also by the Roumanians). Catching fish by means of weirs or wickerwork apparatus belongs to the earliest period,-more primitive are the methods of catching fish by means of the human body and its members (" driving fish," e. g., as practised by the women even now in parts of Hun- gary). Another interesting fish-trap is the Russian zabojka. The Chinese fish-traps have some peculiarities of their own, while the Japanese yeri is very complicated as compared with some of the others. Holl (M.) Mozart's Ohr. Eine anatom- ische Studie. (Ibid., 1-12.) In this article, with 3 text-figures, the author discusses the ear of Mozart, which, from the water-painting in the Mozart Museum at Salzburg, has been recog- nized as " unusual." The conclusion reached is that "there is here no ques- tion of a malformation or of a lower development of the ear, but of a varie- tal formation, an individual variation of the concha, which special peculiarity of form, instead of being termed 'defi- cient concha,' might be called 'the Mo- zart ear.' " This peculiarity seems to have been present in the left ear only of both father and son. Hrdlicka (A.) New instances of com- plete division of the malar bone, with notes on incomplete division. (Amer. Nat., Boston, 1902, XXXVI, 273-294.) After historical introduction the author gives details of seven cases (one in an adult white woman, one in an adult ancient Peruvian man) of complete malar division. On pages 290-291 are tables giving the frequency of partial malar division in skulls of various races (chiefly Amerindian) examined by Dr Hrdlitka. It would appear that par- tial malar division is much more com- mon with Indians than with whites in America, and with them somewhat more common in men, and most fre- quent of all in children. The Peruvi- ans and the southern Utah Cliff Dwellers exhibit this peculiarity the most,-it did not occur in any of twenty Australian and Polynesian skulls ex- amined. In mammals below man ma- lar incisures are very rare. The paper is accompanied by 15 text-figures. Keasbey (L. M.) The descent of man. (Pop. Sci. Mo., N. Y., 1902, LX, 365- 376.) General discussion of the physi- cal and psychical characteristics of the human prototype,-the superiority of the human being "consisted in the ac- quisition of qualities and the occupation of an environment which enabled him to widen the range of his food-choice." The author holds that " the prototype was differentiated from the apes in Indo-Malaysia, during the pliocene pe- riod, and arrived in remote regions of the earth before the prehistoric epoch," -the dispersion of the human race be- ing coincident with the Ice age. The lines of probable migration are also pointed out. Professor Keasbey thinks that " there is archeological and ethno- logical evidence to show that primeval men migrated originally along the lines laid down by the climate and topog- raphy of the glacial periods,"-there were at least three of them. Kjell6n (R.) Om maritim anpassning. (Ymer, Stockholm, 19go, xxI, 417-426.) A general discussion of "maritime ap- titudes," based upon Professor H. H. von Schwerin's Om kustv olks olika sjf'- duglighet in the Lund's Univ. Arsskrift for 19oo. The unequal aptitudes for the sea of various coast-peoples are pointed out, together with differences within the same race. Natural environ- ment and racial disposition are dis- cussed. The most anti-pelagic people of the world are said to be the Alfurus of Buru and Celebes, who are forbidden on pain of death to approach the sea so near as to hear the roar of the waves. The Hovas of Madagascar are not fond of the sea like their kinsmen of the Pacific. The Krumen of western Africa have learned the art, their ancestors having been inland negroes. The AEol- ians differed from the Ionians of old Greece. Kraus (A.) Museo Etnografico-psico- logico-musicale Kraus in Firenze. (Arch. per l'Antrop., Firenze, 190l,</page><page sequence="5">PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 313 Kraus--Continued. xxxI, 271-297.) Brief account of the Kraus Ethnographic- Psychological- Musical Museum in Florence with a catalogue of musical instruments and appliances (now more than Iooo) in the collection. Asia is represented by I8, Australasia and Polynesia by 21, Africa by 32, Europe by 870, and America by 26 specimens. The Kraus collection has already been of great service to students of the history of music. Krause (E.) Zur Frage von der Rot- firbung vorgeschichtlicher Skelett- knochen. (Globus, Brnschwg., 19o1, LXXX, 361-367.) Interesting discus- sion, with bibliographic references, of the coloration (red) naturally or arti- ficially of the bones of prehistoric skele- tons. The coloration in the finds at Brinn, des Hautaux, Mas-d' Azil, Ag- nani and Klein-Cernosek appear to in- dicate intentional reddening, in the last two cases with cinnabar. This paper should be read in connection with Dr Hrdliika's study of red coloration in the American Anthropologist (1901, N. S., III, 714-725). Kretschmer (P.) Das Mirchen von Blaubart. (Mitth. d. anthrop. Ges. in Wien, Igol, xxxI, 62-70.) Discusses the French, and Sicilian versions in particular, the relations of the Blue- beard MAdrchen to demonology and folk- song, etc. The Styrian folk-song, " Es war einmal ein Rittersmann," with the children's song based upon the same theme, "Lieb Anna sasz auf einem Stein, "-in Swabia it appears as "Bertha and the Robber, "-are referred to, and the resemblances of this wide- spread European ballad to the Blue- beard tale indicated. Like many of the versions of the ballad, the Perrault Bluebeard tale has originated " through the contamination of two different stor- ies,-a myth of the demon of the lower world, and a tale of murder living in folk-song and folktale." No such par- ticular individual as Gilles de Retz is commemorated. The author agrees with Hofmann as to the meaning of the term " Bluebeard," and notes that an East Prussian story makes it " Green- beard. " Lacassagne (A.) La mddecine d'autre- fois et le medecin au XXe sidcle. (Rev. Scientif., Paris, 1901, 4e s., XVII, 193- 204.) This study of medicine and the physician past and present includes a brief sketch of their character from ancient Egypt to the present. Lejeune (C.) La repr sentation sexuelle en religion, art et p'dagogie. (Bull. et Mem. Soc. d' Anthr. de Paris, 19or, ve s., II, 465-481.) The author dis- cusses (with 3 text-figures) the uni- versality of the phallic cult and its ramifications, its heirlooms to early Christianity, its symbols, etc. The pen- dant of the phallus, the author thinks, is the triangle (symbolic of the pubic region of the female), and in the lingam both are united. In India the triangle is also the symbol of the trinity. The cross, too, M. Lejeune would derive from the reverse aspect of the human figure. Passing to the consideration of sex and the nude in art, the author treats in general terms the ancient and Christian ideas on these subjects, noting that while in the East religion has gained from the contemplation of the sex-beautiful, in the Occident it has lost not a little. The remaining part of the paper discusses the question of imparting a proper knowledge of sex and generation to the young, a pro- cedure of which M. Lejeune is heartily in favor. Lesshaft (P.) Das Handgelenk des Men- schen. (Anat. Anz., Jena, 190o, xx, 320-340.) General discussion, with re- view of literature of the subject. Lewy (H.) Das Vogelnest im Aberglau- ben. (Ztschr. d. Ver. f. Volkskunde, Berlin, Iqor, xI, 462-463.) Traces the popular superstition (letting the mother- bird fly away) in connection with the finding of a bird's nest to the Biblical admonition in Deut. XXII, 6. Lombroso (C.) La puberte chez les hommes de genie. (Rev. d. Psych. Clin. and Thirap., Paris, 1901, v, 355- 367.) After briefly discussing some geniuses (who seem to have had no fav- oring circumstances) Lombroso treats of emotion during puberty, beauty, pu- berty, tardy emotions, etc. His theory is that the factor determining the real efficacy and specialty of genius is "a strong emotion at the time of puberty." This orients and establishes the indivi- dual as a genius. Beauty and love, religion, etc., may be this inspirer and shepherd of the mind. Lugaro (E.) Una definizione obiettiva dei fenomeni psichici.

The author concludes that "the psychic processes consist of dynamic adaptations obtained by means of the systematic co-ordination of internal pro- cesses which correspond symbolically to external reality, to the needs and dan- gers of the organism, to the reactions of which it is capable." von Luschan (F.) Schbdel aus Guate- mala, Massai-Land und Neu-Britan- nien. (Verh. d. Berl. Ges. f. Anthr., 1901, 285.) Dr von Luschan exhibited to the Society a deformed skull from Guatemala with an index of 123, a not- ably capacious (2000 ccm.) Masai skull, and a skull from New Britain with un- usually large pre-nasal fossa. Magnanimi (R.) Sullx superficie del corpo umano. (Atti d. Soc. Rom. di Antr., 1901 [1902], VIII, 114-120.) In this article, with 3 tables of measure- ments, the author discusses the calcula- tion of the superficies of the human body, its relation to stature, weight, age, and sex. The previous work of Meeh, Fubini and Ronchi, Miwa and Stoeltzner is referred to briefly. The subjects studied were pupils of the Royal Naval Academy at Leghorn (13- 20 years of age) and of the Military School at Milan (11-19 years). Dr Magnanimi uses a special formula of his own and compares the results with those obtained by the Miwa-Stoeltzner process. Mayet (L.) Ueber Hypertrichosis lumbo- sacralis und ihre Auffassung als ein Stigma (Merkmal) von Entartung. (Verh. d. Berl. Ges. f. Anthr., 19g0, 426-430.) Discusses, with I text-fig- ure and a bibliography of 50 titles, lumbo-sacral hypertrichosis as a "de- generative stigma." The special case cited by the author is that of a woman in Lyons, France, who was undoubt- edly a degenerate. Hypertrichosis lumbo-sacralis is to be regarded as "an anatomical degenerative stigma." de Mortillet (P.) Liste des publications de Gabriel de Mortillet. (Bull. et Mem. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 19g0, ve s, 11, 448-468.) Chronological bib- liography 1845-1898. Contains some 400 items, books, articles, reviews, etc. von Negelein (J.) Das Pferd im See- lenglauben und Totenkult. (Ztschr. d. Ver. f. Volkskunde, Berlin, 19Or, xI, 406-420.) First part of an essay on the horse in soul-lore and the cult of the dead. Among the topics consid- ered are: The horse as a religious sac- rifice, the relation of the horse to spirit - phenomena, the horse as an omen-animal, the headless horse, the horse as messenger and carrier to the other world, the white horse and death- steed, the storm-steeds, the devil-horse. In many respects the Semitic ostrich corresponds to the Aryan horse. The article is well-provided with biblio- graphical references. Netri (F.) Identificazione dei recidivi. Sistemo dattiloscopico. (Atti d. Soc. Rom. di Antr., 1901 [1902], viii, 121- 123.) ResumIs Dr Quesada's recent report on the identification of recidivists (Buenos Aires, 1901), advocating the finger-print method. Notes and queries on totemism. (Folk- Lore, Lond., 1901, xII, 385-393.) A questionnaire with 29 rubrics. The introduction defines and describes to- temism generally. Nuttall (G. H. F.) The new biological test for blood in relation to zoological classification. (Proc. Roy. Soc., Lond., LXIX, 150-153.) In the experiments of the author, " the only bloods which gave a reaction similar to that of human bloods have been the bloods of differ- ent species of monkeys,"-the reaction is different only in degree, monkey blood giving a feebler reaction than human blood with the anti-serum for human blood. In the case of the New World monkeys the reaction is less marked than with the Old World mon- keys; the Hapalidae reacted least of all (18 species were tested). Dr Nuttall thinks it may be possible to " determine chemical differences in the blood of the various races of man," so that we will no longer need to depend solely upon morphological characters for the differ- entiation of species. Nystrom (A.) Ueber die Formenverdn- derungen des menschlichen Schidels und deren Ursachen. Ein Beitrag zur Rassenlehre. (Arch. f. Anthr., Brnschwg., 1901, xxvII, 317-336.)

Dr Nystr6m sees a connection between the use of means of transport (horses, sleds, etc.) and brachycephaly, citing as ex- amples certain Mongols, the Lapps, etc., but meets difficulty when he comes to the Chinese and the Eskimo. Some of the brachycephaly of eastern Europe ancient and modern he attributes to wide-spread use of the horse, sleds, car- riages, etc. Artificial deformations have, of course, counted for something. Paul-Boncour (G.) Etude des modifi- cations squelettiques consicutives 'a 1'hemiplegie infantile. (Bull. et Mem. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1901, ve s., II, 382-395.) This second section treats of the humerus (chiefly), radius, and cubitus. The diseased humerus is slenderer, more rounded (anterior edge less prominent), with less voluminous rugosities, narrower and shallower ole- cranian cavity, less torsion, etc. De- tails of the condition of the humeri studied are given. The olecranic per- foration is due to mechanical causes. Pearson (K.) On the inheritance of the mental characters in man. (Proc. Roy. Soc., Lond., LXIX, 153-156.) As the result of very elaborate observations of physical characters in upwards of Ioo families (father,. mother, son, daughter) and IooO pairs of brothers, Professor Pearson concludes that "the mental characters in man are inherited in pre- cisely the same manner as the physi- cal," and "our mental and moral nature is, quite as much as our physical nature, the outcome of hereditary factors." See also Beeton (M.) Pigorini (L.) Museo Preistorico ed Et- nografico di Roma. (Arch. p. 1'Antr., Firenze, 1901, xxxI, 313-317.) Brief account of the origin and present con- dition of the Prehistoric Ethnographic Museum at Rome, founded by the au- thor in 1875. In arrangement the eth- nographic collections of the Museum precede the palethnological (those of Italy first, then other countries). The ethnographic material is arranged geo- graphically. Placzek (S.) Die Skelet-Entwickelung der Idioten. (Verh. d. Berl. Ges. f. Anthr., 1901, 335-345.) Treats, with 12 text-figures (from Rontgen pictures), of the skeletal development of idiots, with particular reference to the hand. The subjects number io, of whom the majority were ca. seven years old. As the result of his careful investiga- tions the author concludes: That in idiots with incomplete growth in height, no arrest of the bony " anlage " exists, but rather a quicker development. Idi- ocy proper is to be distinguished sharply from cretinism. In the discussion on this paper Professor Rudolf Virchow took occasion to say that he had never maintained that cretinism was due to premature synostosis of the cranial bones; what he had maintained was that the peculiar "cretin face " was due to a shortening of the basis of the skull, induced by premature synostosis. Regilia (E.) II Museo Nazionale d' Antropologia in Firenze. (Arch. p. 1' Antrop., Firenze, 1r9o, xxxI, 9-18.) The National Anthropological Museum in Florence was founded in 1869, the first in Italy. The catalogue of ana- tomical material now numbers 4,416 and that of the ethnological 8,o14 speci- mens. Among the more important ana- tomical collections are those of Etruscan and Papuan crania; the Mazzei group of Peruvian skulls; Sommier's collec- tion of Ostiak and Samoyed crania; and Parkinson's collection of 179 New Britain skulls. Of the ethnological the following deserve particular mention: The collection of Capt.

Furia collection from the Gran Chaco; the Scheidel collection from Australasia, Melanesia, Polynesia; the Seton-Karr collection from the Wadi-el-Sheik, etc. The list given on page 17 of Italian and foreign scientific men who have vis- ited the Museum or taken advantage of its collections for their investigations, shows to what good use it has been put. The" Indian Museum "has, since 1891, been under the control of the National Anthropological Museum. - Collezione osteologica di E. Re- gilia in Firenze. (Ibid., 265-270.) The Regalia osteological collection. in Florence consists of the skeletons of terrestrial vertebrates, mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians, and is the best of its kind in Italy, both as to manner of preparation and number of speci- mens. Many distinguished naturalists have consulted it for their studies. It is the result of more than 18 years of labor and sacrifice on the part of Dr Reg ia. It is a museum for the study of quaternary fauna and of great value to the palethnologist. Regnault (F.) La femme &amp; deux nez et le polyzoisme toratologique. (Bull. et Mem. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1901, ve S., II, 333-337.) Brief account of a woman (otherwise normal, intelligent, aged 52 at death) with two noses,-the skull is in the Montpellier Museum. The case ist "a rhinodym variety of a splanchnodym monster." Thesemon- sters arise from the more or less com- plete merging of two embryos,-two primitive individuals fuse and form one. Although having but one brain this monster originated from two embryos. Teratology has evidently something to say to the spiritistic philosophers about the unity of the ego. The paper has 3 text-figures. -- Action du condyle et du muscle temporal sur endocr.ne. (Ibid., 398- 400.) Treats, with I text-figure (cra- nium of hydrocephalous infant), of the effects of contact of the condyle and the temporal muscle with the skull,-the increased elevation of the glenoid fossa in the interior of the skull, the increased prominence of the temporal fossa by reason of internal pressure, etc. - Fmur: empreinte iliaque et angle du col. (Ibid., 377-381.) Treats, with 2 text-figures, of the iliac imprint of the femur (extent, form, edges, ele- vation, degree, mechanism of forma- tion, etc.) and the angle of the neck of the femur (normal and pathological). The angle of the femoral neck dimin- ishes during growth, but is the same in adult and old age. Roediger (M.) Karl Weinhold. Ge- ddchtnisrede. (Ztschr. d. Ver. f. Volks- kunde, Berlin, I90o, xI, 353-376.) Memorial address on Professor Karl Weinhold before the Berlin Verein far Volkskunde, October 25, 1901. At pages 364-376 is given a chronological list of Weinhold's publications, 1843- 19g0, including book-reviews, etc. Showerman (G.) The great mother of the gods. (Bull. Univ. Wisc., Madi- son, 1901, Phil.-Lit. ser., I, No. 3, I- xio.) In this interesting and valuable essay the author summarizes, with 4 plates and 2 text-figures, our knowledge of the "great mother" and her cult from its beginnings in ancient Asia to its eclipse with the Roman empire. The religious, artistic, and literary as- pects of the subject are all considered. Simons (Sarah E.) Social assimilation. (Amer. 3. Sociol., Chicago, nIoI, vII, 53-79, 234-274.) These second and third sections treat of assimilation in the ancient world (Egypt, Greece, Rome), in the Middle Ages in Europe, and in modern times in Russia. Sokeland (H.) On ancient desemers or steelyards. (Ann. Rep. Smithson. Inst. 19o00, Wash., g19O, 551-564.)

In this extensive article Dr Teumin gives the results of the measurements (45 items) of Ioo women students of the University of Ztirich,-- Jewish 47 (Little Russian 31, Polish 16), Russian 32 (Little Russian 4, Great Russian 20), Polish 14, Lithuanian 3, German 3, Armenian I,-taken in the summer and fall of 1899. The num- bers concerned are too small to allow of dogmatic conclusions, but some in- teresting differences appear to be in- dicated. Thompson (A. H.) The cultural sig- nificance of primitive implements and weapons. (Amer. Antiq., Chicago, 1902, XXIV, 37-43.) This first part of Dr Thompson's paper deals with " the gifts of nature." From the vegetal kingdom came "limbs, fruits, etc., of trees, which might be crudely employed as tools and weapons without modifica- tion," the result of prehuman arboreal life. Thus arose the club, the throw- ing-stick, the boomerang, and like weapons and implements. From the mineral kingdom came stones of vari- ous forms and densities ready to the hand, the flint chip, etc., whence the hammer, the knife, the arrowhead. The animal world provided bones, teeth, horn, shell, etc., from which valuable weapons and implements were made. del Torto (0.) Trasferti e raccordi psichici. (Arch. p. l'Antrop., Firenze, 1901, xxxI, 479-500.) General dis- cussion of thought-transference and al- lied subjects. The author reports some of his own experiments. Variot (G.) L'elevage des enfants atro- phiques par 1'emploi methodique du lait sterilise. (Rev. Scientif., Paris, 1901, 4e s., XVII, 225-235.) Gives curves for growth in weight of several atrophic infants fed on sterilized milk. These figures prove the ability of such children to gain the whole or a greater part of the normal weight when well and properly fed. Voss (A.) Nachahmungen von Metall- Gefissen in der prihistorischen Ke- ramik. (Verh. d. Berl. Ges. f. Anthr., 1901, 277-284.) Discusses, with II text-figures, the imitation of metal ves- sels in the prehistoric pottery of central Europe. Among the examples cited are the imitation of a " beak-vessel " in clay from the cemetery of Molinazzo- Arbedo in Tessino, a bird-head handled cup from Weisenacker in Bavaria, a bronze-pail imitated by clay vessel from Forhde in West Havelland, a flat vessel from Brandenburg, a vessel of unusual form from Buchheim in southern Ba- varia. Wake (C. S.) The beard as a test for classification of races. (Amer. Antiq., Chicago, 190, XXIV, 43-45.)

Novyeishie ous- py&amp;chi k' ovdasti antropologii kostnoi sistemy. (Russk. Antrop. Zhur., Moskva, 1901, II, No. 2, 92-125.) This elaborate resume of recent studies of the osseous system of the human body is illustrated with 3 text-figures, and the accompanying bibliography (pages 111-125), which (with a few ex- ceptions) relates to 1899-19oo00, em- braces 315 titles in all European languages. Wilson (T.) Classification des pointes de fl&amp;ches, des points de lances et des couteaux en pierre. (Anthropologie, Paris, I901, xII, 568-594.) This arti- cle, illustrated with 15 plates, classifies arrowheads, lance-points, and stone knives under four large divisions (based upon the general form) with many sub- divisions or classes. The four chief forms are the leaf-shaped, the triangu- lar, the pedunculated, and the aber- rant. This paper is based upon the more extended study by Dr Wilson in the AReport of the U. S. National Museum for 1897. EUROPE Addy (S. O.) Garland day at Castleton. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1901, XII, 394- 430.) A somewhat detailed account, with 4 plates, of the ceremony of " gar- land day" at the village of Castleton, in the High Peak of Derbyshire. Mor- ris-dancers with a king and a queen (man dressed in woman's clothes) per- ambulate the village to music, after which the garlands are raised to the top</page><page sequence="10">318 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 4, 1902 Addy-Continued. of the church tower and fixed upon the pinnacles. The tune to which the pro- cession moves is given with notes on the air known as " Rowty Tow," and some of the words sung to it. The ceremony resembles that of the " grass king " in some parts of Germany. The introduction (pages 395-407) treats of the folklore of Castleton in general. Adler (M.) Zwei Volkslieder aus dem Geiselthal bei Merseburg. (Ztschr. d. Ver. f. Volkskunde, Berlin, 19o0, xI, 449-461.) Texts of two folk-songs, one of which seems historically based upon the suicide of an unfortunate girl some 30 years ago. The author considers it " an example of how folk-songs origi- nate, live on, and, by their continuance, preserve the knowledge of events unre- membered by official documents." Amalfi (G.) Novelluzze raccolte in Te- giano, Prov. di Salerno. (Arch. p. 1. Stud. d. Trad. Pop., Palermo-Torino, 1901, xx, 156-164, 300-311.)

Brief discussion of the fate of pure race types in mixed populations, with special ref- erence to Baden. The physical char- acters of race are transmitted in such a way that all possible theoretical combi- nations occur,-heredity tends to mix distinct characters (dark eyes and blond hair, e. g.). The more characters we consider the less pure types do we find. Very rare is the combination of 5 char- acters of the so-called Teutonic type (blue eyes, blond hair, white skin, tall stature, mesocephaly)-only 1.45~ in Baden. The consideration of other characters would lower still more the percentage. The number of individu- als possessing the original characters, when the mixture is complete, can never sink below a certain limit since such individuals are always reproduced by new combinations. Alleged typi- cally pure racial specimens may thus be nothing more than accidental com- binations. Individuals of "pure race" may exist no more than peoples of " pure race." Bacher (J.) Von dem deutschen Grenz- posten Lus?'rn im wilschen SUdtirol. (Ztschr. d. Ver. f. Volkskunde, Berlin, 1901, xI, 443-452.) Continued from previous number. Contains 66 items (dialect text and literary German rend- ering) of folk-beliefs, customs and say- ings concerning birth and baptism, childhood, youth and love, courting and marriage. Balladoro (A.) Spigolature poetiche Veronesi. (Arch. p. 1. Stud. d. Trad. Pop., Palermo-Torino, 19go, xx, 195- 20.) These " poetical gleanings" con- sist of some 25 brief folk-poems on a variety of topics, from divers parts of the region of Verona (from Pacengo chiefly). Some prayers and lullabies are included. A number of the verses are satirical. - Filastrocche popolari Veronesi. (Ibid., 311-318.) Text of eight " non- sense" poems from the region of Ver- ona, with some explanatory notes. Bellino (A.) Habitagao urbana. (Portu- galia, Porto, 1901, I, 613-618.) Brief account, with I I text-figures, of remark- able urban dwellings in Braga and Gui- maraes. Bloch (A.) De 1' origine des brachy- cephales neolithiques de la France. (An- thropologie, Paris, 1901, xII, 541-549.) From*the consideration of the seriation of the cephalic indices of the race of Petit-Morin Dr Bloch concludes that they exemplify not a mixed race of longheads and shortheads, but a dolicho- cephalic race in process of metamor- phosis into a brachycephalic, thereby giving rise to neolithic shortheads in France. The presence of the latter is due to anatomical variation and repre- sents no sudden inroad of brachyce- phalic tribes from abroad. The presence of the metopic suture "is a manifest proof of the gradual transformation of the primitive dolichocephalic type into a brachycephalic." At Petit-Morin this had been already accomplished, but not at Baumes-Chaudes. The au- thor's general thesis is that " the neo- lithic brachycephals of France are the direct descendants, without intermix- ture, of the neolithic dolichocephals, which last are themselves the descend- ants of the paleolithic dolichocephals." The discussion following this paper was rather against the author. Bolte (J.) Eine geistliche Auslegung des Kartenspiels. (Ztschr. d. Ver. f. Volks- kunde, Berlin, 1901o, xI, 376-4o6.) A</page><page sequence="11">PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 319 Bolte- Continued. well-documented account of the "spirit- ual interpretation " of playing-cards,- the usual form is the tale of the excuse of a soldier found card-playing in church, -in the European folk-literature of the nineteenth century. The tale is known from French, English, Swedish, Danish, Dutch, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and Icelandic sources. The texts of the oldest German, the Portu- guese, and the Italian versions of the tale are given (pages 382-387). Pages 387-405 treat of the spiritual explana- tions in folk-songs (" number songs") of the card-numbers I-rto and the lists of sacred numbers I-12, in Europe, the Orient, etc. The texts and music of a number of the songs are given. In the versions of the soldier's excuse the card- numbers appear as follows: Ace = one God, one belief, one baptism; deuce = Old and New Testament, body and soul, God and Christ, two natures of Christ, two thieves, virtue and vice, two sacra- ments, two tables of the law; trey-= Trinity, the three days of Jonah in the whale's belly, three Graces; four = the last things (death, judgment, hell, para- dise), the evangelists, the seasons, the four estates; five-- the wise virgins, the wounds of Christ, the senses; six = days of the creation, work-days, the petitions in the Lord's Prayer, the pil- grimages of man; seven = -the day of rest, the words of Christ on the cross, the Sacraments, the petitions in the Lord's Prayer, the wonders of the world, the planets; eight = the family of Noah, the benedictions of the ser- mon on the mount, the mountains of Calvary; nine = the ungrateful lepers, the choirs of angels, the virgins who adored Christ, the Muses, the hours of Christ on the cross; ten = the ten com- mandments; Jacks = Judas (Jack of clubs or of spades) and the soldiers who maltreated Jesus; Queens = Queen of Sheba, Mary and the three women at the grave of Christ; Kings = God, the sovereign, Herod, the three Kings at the cradle of Christ, the judges of Christ, the evangelists. Besides all this, the four colors signify the seasons, red and black the blood and passions of Christ, diamonds the place where the body of Christ was put (also the four corners of the church); spades the spear or the grave of Christ; hearts the love of Christ, or the devotion of the church- goer; clover the union, zeal, and love of the three women who went to the tomb, the cross, or the crown of thorns. The twelve card-pictures represent the months, the fifty-two cards the weeks, the 365 points the days of the year. Braga (T.) Sobre as estampas ou grav- uras dos livros populares. (Portugalia, Porto, 1901, I, 497-512.) This inter- esting account of prints and engravings in Portuguese popular literature is illus- trated with 46 text-figures. The livros de cordel correspond to the French Bib- liotheque bleue and the Spanish Pliegos sueltos. By their contents very many of these brochures show their origin from the popular literature of medieval Europe,-reduced and distorted legends and stories of heathen heroes and Chris- tian saints, tales of adventure and shipwreck, accounts of monsters, calamities, etc., great natural phenom- ena, comical and facetious deeds and es- capades. The most picturesque thing about them is the illustrations, a neces- sary part of these little books. A good many of these pictures are pretty rude examples of Portuguese esthetics, both those going with verse and those with prose. Some of the flysheets had an immense circulation. When the old xylography is being superseded by zinco- graphy, illustration becomes accurate and spontaneous, natural and esthetic. So the future of illustration would seem to be the popularizing of photographs and esthetic ideas of the great masters. Thus it will still exercise a great sug- gestive r6le in the popular imagination. The illustrations for such works as the Historia do Propheta e Santo Rei David, Historia do Imperador Carlos MIagno, the numerous Autos, the Lunario Per- .petuo (astrological almanacs), etc., re- produced by the author are curious and sometimes wonderful. Many literary works got into popular favor in this way-Don Quixote, Gil Blas, Paul and Virginia, A'obinson Crusoe, Gulliver's Travels, Thousand and One Nights, besides native Pdrtuguese books. The subject of Portuguese popular literature in general was treated by Braga at pages 448-498 of his former study O Povo portuguez nos seus Costumes, Crenfas e Tradi4does (Lisboa, I885). Calvert (F.) Ein Idol vom thracischen Chersones. (Verh. d. Berl. Ges. f. Anthr., 190IgoI, 329-330.) This brief note (in English), with text-figure, de- scribes an idol in white marble from Kilia (Ccela), representing "a grotesque human form," with wings and some</page><page sequence="12">320 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N.

(Folk-Lore, Lond., 1901, XII, 455-456.) Brief account of the " Madonna in the oak," at the edge of the forests of Mt Aimata, Tuscany. The church-authorities have been un- able to prevent the people adoring their tree. Capitan (L.) Gravures rupestres dans les Vosges. (Anthropologie, Paris, 1901, XII, 539-540.) Brief account of the sculptures on the Pierre A Mulet in the Bois de Marey near Martigny-les- Bains, Department of the Vosges. Dr Capitan, who examined the rock quite recently, found more figures than those reported by Voulot. Among these are numerous crosses, two horseshoes (one of a Gallic type), pittings, etc., and many other curious signs. These in- scriptions are probably quite ancient. The author suggests comparison with the wasin (" property marks ") of the nomadic Arabs. They may have also a religious or fetishistic significance. - Sur les grands anneaux enpierre de 1'dpoque ndolithique. (Ibid., 556- 557.) Brief discussion of the large flat stone rings of hard stone (jadeite, nephrite, etc.) found at Quiberon, Vol- ney, Tararou, etc. Dr Capitan com- pares them with similar rings of less size in use as priestly ornaments in Japan, farther India, Mexico. Their presence in Gaulish sepulchres may have a religious significance. The breast - rings of the menhir - statues of the Aveyron may thus represent real stone rings of this kind and not rings of metal as some have supposed. Cauderlier (G.) Les causes de la de- population de la France. (Bull. et Mem. Soc. d'Anths. de Paris, 1901, ve s., II, 520-540.) The author's gen- eral thesis, discussed more at length in his recent book, Les lois de la popula- tion, is that " population increases with the increase of the proportion of re- sources to needs, and vice versa." This law has, however, modifications, excep- tions, and particular exemplifications. Among the results of this general law are: Population varies according to eco- nomic conditions; the depopulation of the country districts and mountain val- leys; tendency of coastal fishing popu- lations to increase (the sea-food being inexhausible) ; countries rich in mineral wealth will increase indefinitely in population with proper means of trans- portation at home and abroad; coun- tries dependent upon commerce principally will increase in population indefinitely if trade is not interfered with by legislation; the rich and well- to-do population of the country seeks the city where the means are at hand to satisfy the new needs created by the progress of civilization; centralization of public service in one town or in a few injures the general population; laws of succession are without influence upon the development of population, except as they may increase or decrease resources and needs; so too with all legislative and fiscal measures intended to increase directly marriages and births; the celibacy of priests and monks and nuns will influence very little the total population, because the majority of them render to the collec- tivity what services they can,-not so however with the idle celibates who give society no service; the diminu- tion of mortality acts differently upon th e tot al population according to whether it bears upon men and women capable of working and producing or upon the incapable. The discussion of this paper revealed many disagree- ments with the author. Chauvet (G.) Poteries prdhistoriques A ornaments geometriques en creux, val- lee de la Charente. (Anthropologie, Paris, 1901, xIi, 641-661.) Discusses, with I plate and 16 text-figures, the remains of pottery with incised geomet- ric ornamentation discovered at the "station" of Bois du Roc. The first part of the paper gives a resume, with numerous bibliographical references, of our knowledge of the distribution of this kind of pottery over Europe and the Mediterranean region generally. According to the author in neolithic pottery of the Charente valley this sort of ornamentation (rare on funeral pot- tery, more common on camp pottery) has no very deep lines, nor were the incisures filled with coloring matter; this ornamentation reaches its maximum with the age of bronze-the incisures deeper and larger, perhaps to receive coloring matter; the geometric orna- mentation does not disappear with the Iron age, but the incisures do; the</page><page sequence="13">PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 321 Chauvet--Continued. variations in type are such as might readily occur in the local development of the industry. The study of the pot- tery of Bois du Roc seems to " indicate closer relations of central Europe with Spain and the Mediterranean." Coelho (F. A.) A pedagogia do povo Portugues. (Portugalia, Porto, 1901, I, 475-496.) Continued from the pre- vious two numbers. This third chap. ter deals with proverbs in general. After a general introduction (historical and bibliographical) the author dis- cusses Portuguese proverbs and pro- verbial phrases under the following heads: Religious, ecclesiastical (heathen - Christian), - God, Christ, Trinity, Saints, Devil, Clergy and ecclesiastical persons, Paradise, church, religious acts, festivals, Rome, etc.; geographical and historical (medieval and modern),- Moors, modern peo- ples, countries and places, institutions, customs, weights, measures, money, military and civil personages, historical facts and persons, etc. Many of the proverbs relating to Christian matters are really of heathen origin, proper names, etc., being changed. Among the words for " proverb " now or for- merly in use in Portuguese are the following: vervo or vervo antigo (used in the Cancioneiros of the xIi-xiv cen- turies), exemplo (common in the xv-xvI centuries), refrdo (borrowed from France in the Middle Ages), adagio (a purely literary word), ditado (popular in sense of " proverb "), proverbio (liter- ary, but becoming popular). Dr Coelho prefers the last term. A curi- ious term for " the proverb runs, etc.," is " the parrot (papagaio) says." The article is to be continued in the next number. - Alfaia agricola portugueza. (Ibid., 398-416, 633-649.) An elaborate and interesting account, with 23 text- figures, of Portuguese agricultural im- plements. Dr Coelho concludes that two facts especially are brought out by this study, viz., the very archaic form of many of the implements and the exceptional preponderance of Latin terminology. The last fact proves rather a greater Romanization in the matter of language than an origin of some of these implements and appli- ances through contact with the Latins. Cordell (E. F.) The medicine and doc- tors of Horace. (Bull. J. H. U. Hosp., Baltimore, Igo1, XII, 233-240.) An interesting discussion of the references to physicians and medical matters in the old Roman poet. The author re marks that " nowhere in all his extant writings is there a word of unkindness or ridicule of the professors of medi- cine." This is noteworthy, "when we reflect upon the character of the Ro- man profession of his day, just emerg- ing from obscurity, and chiefly in the hands of slaves and foreign adventurers, bent in most cases solely upon self-ag- grandizement." Horace, too, was a de- cided invalid for the last half of his life. A list of diseases mentioned by Horace and of his limited materia medica is given on pages 238 and 239. Corsi (G. B.) La mezza quaresima in Siena e nel Senese. (Arch. p. 1. Stud. d. Trad. Pop., Palermo-Torino, 19or, xx, I45-155.) Brief account of the customs and ceremonies at Mid-Lent in Siena and the surrounding region, based on the diary (1785-1838) of A. F. Ban- dini. Bonfires, dances, puppet-shows directed against the monks, effigy- burning, feasts, etc., are noted. Ac- cording to Corsi a sort of charivari is still enacted on this day in parts of the Siena country. The play, too, survives, but " the old woman" has taken the place of the monk. The verses re- cited are given on pages 15 1-155. Coutil (L.) L' industrie primitive du cuivre et du bronze en Normandie. L' analyse des principales formes d' in- struments. (Anthropologie, Paris, 90oI, xII, 624-628.) Gives details of an- alyses of axes of red copper from the department of Eure and bronze axes and swords from the departments of Seine-Inferieure and Eure in Nor- mandy. From these analyses the author concludes that classification by amount of tin is not decisive. Two copper axes from Leubecourt, about the same in form and size, contained the one 0.4 of tin, the other 3.8. In the bronze axes the tin varied from 0o.I to 18.I. The iron in the bronze swords varies from 1.8 to 4.2 per cent. Crocioni (G.) Novelle popolari in dia- letto di Canistro. (Ibid., 185-194.)

Brief account, with 3 text- figures, of the finds at the neolithic burial-place of Presles (stone chamber, resembling some dolmens of the Aveyron and Morbihan). Beside osseous re- mains (for the discussion of which see the article of M. Manouvrier), there were also found a fine polished flint axe, another of serpentine, fragment of characteristic neolithic pottery. The cover of the chamber is missing, and certain fragments of Merovingian pot- tery discovered may have been intro- duced at the time of its removal. See Manouvrier. - Silex des stations ndolithiques de Presles. (Ibid., 376). Brief notice of flints found on the surface at Mont- Joli and Carri~re-Martin near the neo- lithic burial-place previously described. Friederichsen (M.) Beitrdge zur geo- graphischen Characteristik der Bretagne und des franz6sischen Zentralmassivs. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1901, LXXX, 297- 302, 315-323, 334-339.) This article with 25 text-illustrations contains a few remarks upon the stone monuments of Brittany. Furno (A.) Uno stornellaio Fiorentino. (Arch. p. 1. Stud. d. Trad. Pop., Palermo-Torino, 19or, XX, 340-347.) Brief account of a Florentine singer of stornelli, with numerous specimens of his verses and the notes of the music. von Gabnay (F.) Rachepuppen aus Ungarn. (Globus, Brnschwg., 19o0, LXXX, 373.) Brief account, with text- figure, of a witch-doll from the Hun- garian Roumanians of Petirs in the county of Temes. Such dolls are made by old witches for young women who have been deceived by their lovers. Gotze (A.) Antwort auf die Angriffe des Hrn. Reinecke. (Verh. d. Berl. Ges. f. Anthr., 1901, 414-422.) Reply to P. Reinecke's criticism (in the Ver- handlungen for 900oo) of the author's views on neolithic pottery, its ornamen- tation, chronological succession of types, etc. de la Granciire (A.) Passage du ndo- lithique aux metaux en Armorique oc- cidentale et plus specialement dans le Morbihan. (Anthropologie, Paris, ,90go, xII, 629-640.) According to the author, in Morbihan and all western Brittany, there is no evidence of a veri-</page><page sequence="15">PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 323 de la Granciere-Continued. table Copper age preceding that of Bronze; nor has any axe of pure cop- per made upon the model of polished stone axes been found in western Ar- morica, as has been the case in certain parts of southern and central Europe. The transition from the Stone to the Bronze age in Brittany was not at all sudden. The use of bronze came in gradually and stone implements sur- vived long after its beginning as may be seen from the " furniture " of the Ar- morican monuments, and the structure of the monuments themselves. Grip (E.) SkuttungemMlets ljudlaira. (Svenska LandsmMlen, Stockholm, 1901, xvIII, No. 6, 1-186.) This elaborate study of the phonology of the dialect of Skuttunge is a thesis for the doctor's degree at the University of Upsala. The material was collected in the sum- mers of I896-1900. da Guerra (L. de F.) Uma povoaqCo subterrada. (Portugalia, Porto, Iqol, I, 609-612.) Brief account of the bur- ied town of Neiva (submerged in the latter part of the sixteenth century). Halbherr (F.) Report on the researches at Proesos. (Amer. J. Archoeol., Nor- wood, Mass., 1901, SEC. S., V, 371-392.) Brief account, with 3 plates and 25 text-figures, of investigations at the an- cient Cretan city of Praesos, with de- scriptions of objects found. The votive terra-cottas are particularly rich and primitive. The little bronzes re- semble those of Mt Ida, but they do not predominate at Praesos. Like Mt Ida, Proesos was a " place of worship of ancient origin, practiced without a temple, in the midst of the wildness of nature," at Mt Ida in a cave, at Prae- sos in the open air. - Ruins of unknown cities at Hag- hios Ilias and PriniL. (Ibid., 393- 403.) Brief account, with 17 text-fig- ures, of finds at the unknown Cretan cities of Haghios Ilias in Pediada and PriniA in Malevisi. Where the chief temple of the first city once stood is now the little country church of St Elijah. Some of the inscriptions are very archaic. Hermet (L'Abbd) Stafues-menhirs de l'Aveyron, du Tarn, et de 1'Herault. (Anthropologie, Paris, Igo1, xII, 595- 608.) Brief account of the menhir- statues of Aveyron (I2 in number), AM. ANTH. N. S., 4-21 Tarn (8), Herault (2), with remarks as to their age and intention. Of these 9 are of males, 6 of females, 7 doubtful. Hoernes (M.) Gegenwdirtiger Stand der keltischen Archaologie. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1901, LXXX, 329-332.) Resume, based on Dichelette's recent article, " L'Archeologie Celtique," in the Revue de synthe/se historique. Dechelette divides the "Keltic pe- riod" (which includes the last eight centuries B.C.) into proto-Keltic (Hall- statt) and Keltic proper (La TVne). The Keltic inroad is assigned a much later date than many other authorities would give it. Altogether Dichelette takes too conservative a view of the whole matter. Keltic imitation of Greek and Roman art is given promi- nence by Dichelette. Hoffmann-Krayer (E.) Die Berufe in der Volkskunde. (Schweiz. Arch. f. Volkskunde, Zurich, I9oI, v, 304- 308.) Gives dialect texts of a number of popular and satirical verses relating to trades and professions, particularly that of the tailor. The rhymes cited are chiefly from Zurich. Hifler (M.) Die Hedwig- Sohlen. (Ztschr. d. Ver. f. Volkskunde, Berlin, 1901, xT, 455-458.) Brief account, with I plate (14 figs.), of the " stock- ing-soles," or "St Hedwig's soles," a species of bread or cake baked in Bres- lau, Neisse, Treibnitz, etc., on the 17th October in honor of St Hedwig, who is said to have founded this baking as a gift to the poor. The author is in- clined to believe that we have here a transformation of the older Teutonic " death shoe" or " sacrificial shoe" into a charity-loaf, etc. Hull (Eleanor) The silver bough in Irish legend. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 90go, xII, 431-445.) Discusses the " silver bough" referred to in the Voyage of Bran, the Sickbed of Cuchulainn, Cormac's Adventure in the Land of Promise, Conla Ruadh, and other old Irish tales and stories and its relation to the talismanic apple-branch and " golden bough " of other legends and myths. Miss Hull asks in conclusion : " Is not the Gaelic apple-bough of en- trance into the unseen world nearer in idea to the conception of Virgil [of the bough plucked by command of the Sybil and carried by AEneas into the under-world] than the legend of</page><page sequence="16">324 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 4, 1902 Hull-Continued. the bloody sacrifice within the groves of Nemi, or the story of the flight of Orestes from which this is supposed to have had its origin ? " lIwolf (F.) Volkstumliches aus Jonathan Swift. (Ztschr. d. Ver. f. Volkskunde, Berlin, 1901, xI, 463-464.) The author compares the " penny-tossing " with the Steirmark game "Anmiuerln "; also Swift's remarks about holy-water sprink- ling with procedures still in use in the Alpine country. Ive (A.) Novelline, storie, leggende in Veglioto odierno. (Arch. p. 1. Stud. d. Trad. Pop., Palermo-Torino, I9go, xx, 289-299.) Continued from previous volume. Nos.

Ger- man text of 27 brief tales from the Val d'Anniviers between the Rhone glacier and the lake of Geneva. These folk- tales were gathered in July and Sep- tember, 19oo, and January, 1901. They treat of fairies, cows, buried treasures, ghosts, the devil, witches, human sacri- fice, robbers, magic, etc. Jetta (J.) e Giannini (G.) L' ultimo giorno di carnevale a Bibbiena. (Arch. p. 1. Stud. d. Trad. Pop., Palermo- Torino, 1901, xx, 209-218.) Brief ac- count of the songs, ceremonies, etc., of the last day of the carnival at Bibbiena in Casentino, with bibliographical notes. The texts of the songs are given. The ceremonies in question are said to go back at least to the middle of the 14th century. Kahle (B.) Von de la Martinieres Reise nach dem Norden. (Ztschr. d. Ver. f. Volkskunde, Berlin, 1901r, XI, 431-443.) Resumes, from the German edition of 1706, the chief items concerning Nor- way, the Lapps, the Russians (marriage- customs particularly), Samoyeds, etc., in the account of his travels in far north- ern countries in the year 1653, given by the surgeon, Pierre Martin de la Mar- tinibre. The oldest edition extant seems to be a French one published at Paris in 1671. The natives of the island of Zembla were reported to worship trees shaped rudely to resemble the human form. The name for such a figure is given as fetitzo, evidently, as Feilberg notes, the Portuguese feitifo, ourfetish, an early instance of the use of this word in German. Kasser(H.) Die Reinhardt'sche Samm- lung von Schweizer Trachten aus den Jahren 1789-1797. (Schweiz. Arch. f. Volkskunde, ZUrich, 1901, v, 269-280.) Brief account, with 2 plates (one col- ored), of the Reinhardt collection of paintings of Swiss costumes, now in the Bern Historical Museum. Of the 124 paintings 9 represent Zurich, 12 Bern, 7 Luzern, 4 Uri, 9 Schwyz, 5 Unter- walden, 4 Zug, I Appenzell, 4 Glarus, Io Freiburg, 7 Solothurn, I Thurgau, 3 Basel, 8 Schaafhausen, 3 Appenzell A./Rh., 4 Appenzell I./Rh., 7 St Gallen, I Baselland, 15 Aargau, 2 Waadt, I Wallis, 2 Neuenberg, 4 Schwarzwald, I Bregenzerwald. They were all painted by Joseph Reinhardt between 1789 and 1797. Of the paint- ings II8 containing 279 portraits are dated, and the artist has inscribed upon the back of each picture the names of his subjects. The paintings are all at full length. The collection is of great value for the historical study of cos- tume. Kollmann (J.) Die Fingerspitzen aus dem Pfahlbau von Corcelettes, Schweiz. (Arch. p. I'Antr., 1901, xxxI, 403-412.) General discussion, with 2 text-figures, of the impressions of finger-ends, nails, and knuckles on pottery from the lake- dwelling of Corcelletes on the left shore of Lake Neuchbtel. See American Anthropologist, 1901, III, 183. Kraitschek (G.) Der alpine Typus. (Cbl. f. Anthr., Jena, 1901, VI, 321- 330o.) The author takes the view that Ripley's assumption of three European basal races (Teutonic, Alpine. Mediter- ranean) is untenable, since the so-called "Alpine race" is an evidently mixed stock, and not in any sense co-equal with the other two. The variation in the characters of the " Alpine type " is far too great to allow us to reckon it as a primitive race-form,--roundish head and medium stature seem to be about the only constant factors here; color of skin, eyes, hair, form of face, nose, etc., differ widely in the " Alpine type." Often we meet with a mixture of Teu-</page><page sequence="17">PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 325 Kraitschek-Contiuued. tonic skull and Mongolian face, or of a broad head and a long face, etc.-we have to do with diverse combinations of short-heads and long-heads. Ripley's term (the homo alpinus of Linnaeus) is better than the other designations (Cel- tic, Ligurian, Turanian, etc.), provided it does not carry the implication that the whole Alpine xegion is populated by a unitary type. Krause (E.) Eisensachen der Wikinger- Zeit von Mewe, Westpr. (Verh. d. Berl. Ges. f. Anthr., 1901, 350-352.) Brief account of the iron objects (sword, stirrup, buckles, buttons, snaffles, weight, lance-point, knives, nails, etc.) discovered at the first find of the viking period hitherto made in West Prussia. The weight had been coated with bronze. A more detailed description of this important find is promised later. La Colombina in Firenze nelsabato santo del IgoI. (Arch. p. 1. Stud. d. Trad. Pop,, Palermo-Torino, I901, XX, 416- 417.) Brief account of the " flight of the dove" at Easter in Florence,-still an augury of an auspicious season. La Corte-Cailler (G.) Burle del secolo xvII agli schiavi in Messina. (Ibid., 202-208.) Cites from a Ms. of 1695 passages concerning the slaves in Mes- sina, their confraternity, and their cere- monial processions, together with many silly actions and jests on their part and against them by the populace of Mes- sina. Burle, facezie e motti dei monelli in Messina nel secolo xvIi. (Ibid., 365-386.) Cites from a MS. of 1695 examples of the jests, satire, bon-mot, facetiousness, etc., of the rogues, pick- pockets, etc., of Messina in the 17th century. Not only the monks, but the highest in the land fell victims to the rude wit of these fellows. The negro slaves were an especial object of their raillery. They applauded the Span- iards and abused the French. Lampa (S. M.) FAleberg. Anteckningar om en gammal Vistg6taby. (Svenska Landsmalen, Stockholm, 1901, XIx, No. 5, 1-32). Treats, with 13 illustra- tions and 4 maps, of the old town of FAleberg in West Gotland from the I3th century down. Houses, inhabi- tants, etc., at various periods are dis- cussed. La vie de Paris, les cris de la rue. (Arch. p. 1. Stud. d. Trad. Pop., Pa- lermo- Torino, 1901, xx, 253-256.) Brief description of the life of the streets in Paris, the street-cries, etc., from winter to winter again. Laville (A.) Etude de couches Sannois- iennes ddmantel1es, de'layees et ddpo- s6es sur les pentes A l'dpoque pleistoc6ne A Montmagny, Villetaneuse et Villejuif. (Bull. et Mum. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1901go, ve s., , 338-341.) In this paper (with 3 text-figures) the author reaches the conclusion that the deposits in question " are only a local facies of quaternary clays and represent the strata e-h of the middle quaternary beds of the division of Ladri&amp;re." This paper is preliminary to a general work on the quaternary deposits of Paris. - Silex taillis recueillis A Therdonne, pr&amp;s Beauvais, Oise. (Ibid., 401-402.) Brief note on flints found at Therdonne near Beauvais in August, I900. Lockyer (N.) An attempt to ascertain the date of the original construction of Stonehenge from its orientation. (Proc. Roy. Soc., Lond., 1901, LXIX, I37- I47.) Takingthe viewthat Stonehenge was a "solar temple," and that the orientation of the avenue accords with that of its axis, the author comes to the conclusion that 1680 (?4 200) B.C. is the date of construction of this famous monument. See also NVature, London, I901I, LXV, 55-57. de Lo8 (A.) Decouverte de palafittes en Belgique. (Anthropologie, Paris, 1901o, XII, 558-564.) After noting pre- vious discoveries of less extent and im- portance, the author gives a brief account of the discovery in 1899 of remains of lake-dwellings at Roulers, Emelghem, and Denterghem, in the Mandel valley, West Flanders. The most important finds were made during the draining of a marshy meadow at Denterghem, where 300 oaken piles, many planks, beams, etc., large num- bers of flint and bone implements and rejects,fragments of implements of great variety, fragments of human and many bones of a great number of animals (wolf, dog, fox, deer, horse, boar, goat, ox), besides bronze objects, pottery (whole and fragmentary, hand and wheel made) of periods from neolithic times to the 15th century, a coin of</page><page sequence="18">326 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 4, 1902 de Lo?--Continued. Trajan, the bottom of an earthen vessel marked Conatius, etc., were found. The Denterghem remains are important as indicating the presence in lower Bel- gium of extensive lake-dwellings and their continuous or repeated occupancy from the neolithic period to about the close of the Middle Ages of European history. The condition and state of the piles, no less than the objects dis- covered, argue in favor of this view. Lutzu (P.) La festa di S. Giovanni in Montiferro. (Arch. p. 1. Stud. d. Trad. Pop., Palermo-Torino, 1901, xx, 257- 259.) Brief account of the festival of St John in Montiferro, Sardinia. Macnamara (N. C.) Studien iiber den prihistorischen Menschen und sein VerhSiltniss zu der jetzigen Bev1lkerung Westeuropas. (Arch. f. Anthr., Brn- schwg., Iqgo, XXVII, 365-378.) Inthis article, illustrated by 3 plates con- taining 33 figures of crania and living individuals, the author discusses pre- historic man in general and his relation to the present population of western Europe. Dr Macnamara maintains, among other things, that the factors determining the growth of the skull are different from those that develop the brain, and that the inhabitants of west- ern Europe in the late tertiary and early quaternary period had, with respect to the shape of the frontal region of their skulls, a form much nearer that of the chimpanzee than is that of the skulls of modern European races. The author refers to the various prehistoric races of Europe - the Iberian (Mediterranean, or Africo-European, "the only race in Europe at the beginning of the neolithic period"), the proto-Aryan (Asiatic, or Cro-Magnon) of the middle neolithic age, the tall, blond Mongolian (North Asiatic, the first brachycephalic race to penetrate into Europe), the south Mon- golian (short, brachycephalic) of the Bronze age. Each of these races had its peculiar culture and has left its peculiar relics, and each has its modern representatives today, with their dif- fering temperaments and intellectual equipment, in England and various parts of the Continent. Some of the opinions expressed in this study need a great deal more proof, those especially relating to Asiatic immigration into Europe in prehistoric times. The same questions have been discussed at greater length by Dr Macnamara in his book, Origin and Character of the British People (London, 1900). Macquart (E.) L'augmentation de la morti-natalite. (Bull. et Mem. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 19go, ve s,, II, 482- 490.) Brief discussion of the increase in the proportion of still-born to total births in France and other European countries. The author concludes that the generative power of Frenchmen in particular is diminishing, whatever other factors may enter into the re- sult. In the discussion, M. Papil- lault warned against attributing the increase of still-born to either pri- mordial weakness of the germ or social, intellectual, or other inferiority acting upon it, when so many accidental or incidental factors might share in the matter. Magni (A.) Pietre cupelliformi nuo- vamente scoperte nei dintorni di Como. (Riv. Arch. Com., Como, Igoi, 19- 134.) A detailed account, with 22 plates (53 figs.) and a topographical map, of cupped and pitted stones re- cently discovered in the neighborhood of Como. The various theories as to the origin of these "cup stones" are discussed, and pages 124-134 are occu- pied by a chronological (1801-1901) bibliography of the general subject. Manouvrier (L.) Note sur les osse- ments recueillis dans la sdpulture dol- menique de Presles. (Bull. et Mr m. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, g19O, le s., II, 425-427.) Brief account of human bones (fragments of femurs and tibias) from the dolmen-grave of Presles in Seine-et-Oise. At least 8 persons (2 men, 3 women, and 3 children) were buried there. The measurements of the fragments are given. See Fou- jou (G.). Mantegazza (P.) Trent'Anni di storia della Societ? Italiana d'Antropologia, Etnologia e Psicologia comparata.

First part of transcription,from " an old MS." (in the Sicilian dialect), of a long ac- count and description of buried treas- ures and how to recover them. These treasures were " buried " by the Greeks in the time of the Emperor Michael Balbus. de Mattos (M.) Cultura dos trigaes no Alemtejo. (Portugalia, Porto, 1goI, I, 622.) Brief description of the pro- cess of treating the soil, known as moreias, in use in Alemtejo. Mayet (L.) Nouvelles recherches sur la r6partition geographique du goitre et du cretinisme. (Bull. et Mdm. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, I9OI, ve S., II, 431- 436.) General discussion of the sub- ject, with three maps. Goitre is very common in 35 departments, rare in 19, and almost unknown in the rest. It is most frequent in the mountainous re- gions (except that it is common in Aisne and Orne),--as in Switzerland, Italy, Germany, etc. That endemic goitre and cretinism are related is proved by clinical observation and experiment, but the statistics in the matter hardly yield more than negative results. The causes of idiocy are varied and often multiple, and goitre is neither the only cause, nor the only sign in the regions where both prevail. Dr Mayet notes that there is less and less tendency to- day to make distinctions of importance between idiocy proper and' cretinism, while the division of goitre into endemic and sporadic is largely artificial. Mochi (A.) L'istituzione di un labora- torio antropometrico nel Museo Nazi- onale d'Antropologia dell' Istituto di Studi Superiori in Firenze. (Arch. p. 1'Antrop., Firenze, 1901, xxxI, 319- 340o.) The author argues for the insti- tution of anthropometric laboratories and sketches the history of the move- ment which has resulted in the estab- lishment of the Mantegazza memorial laboratory in the Istituto di Studi Su- periori, in Florence. At pages 329-335 is given a list of the observations, ex- periments, measurements, etc., to be undertaken in such a laboratory. Modin (E.) Hirjedalens ortnamn ock bygdesdgner. (Svenska Landsmalen, Stockholm, 1901, xix, No. 2, 1-128.) An interesting study of place-names and folk-history in Harjedal. On pages 12-20 are given lists of terms for mountain and hill, woodland, waters and their environment, meadows, etc. At pages 21-26 is a list of old Hirjedal personal names. The names are treated by parishes. The oldest form of the name of the province itself seems to be Heriardal in 1273 A.D. Monteiro (R.) Os palitos. (Portugalia, Porto, 1901, I, 627-628.) Brief ac- count of one of the old, disappearing industries of Portugal, the making of tooth-picks by hand. The manufac- ture is traditionally localized in Lorvao and Coimbra. The material used is the Salix alba. The fabrication has now become a mere automatism, the older ornamentation having been dropped. Montelius (0.) La chronologie prdhis- torique en France et en d'autres pays celtiques. (Anthropologie, Paris, 19ol, XII, 609-623.) In this article, illustrated by 5 figures showing 63 specimens, the author discusses the chronology of France and other Celtic countries in prehistoric times, relative and ab- solute. Morax (R.) Le carnaval dans la vallie de Conches. (Schweiz. Arch. f. Volks- kunde, Zurich, 1901, v, 281-287.) Brief account of the amusements and ceremonies of carnival week in the Conches valley of upper Valais. The Einreden, dances, music, Giger Mon- tag, etc., are referred to. The adults' attempt to suppress the Einreden, something akin to flirtation, has not succeeded. At the dances old music is in vogue. During the carnival the na- tural gaiety of the people has free rein. de Mortillet (P.) Coup de poing chellen du Visinet. (Bull. et Mim. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1901, ve S., II, 403.) Note on a fine specimen of " coup de poing " of the Chelles type from Visinet in Seine-et-Oise. Natividade (M. V.) Grutas de Alcobaga. (Portugalia, Porto, 1901, I, 433-474.) This article, with 24 plates containing 237 figures of implements of stone, bone, pottery, etc., and map of the</page><page sequence="20">328 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 4, 1902 Natividade--Continued. archeological province of Alcobaga, gives a brief account of investigations of the various neolithic " stations " (caves) in the region of Alcobaga in western central Portugal. The author divides the "stations" explored into seven groups: I. Type of Lagoa do Cdo. With rude neolithic objects and pottery. Predominance of flints with thick tri- angular section. Flint spear-heads. Schist axes. Bear's teeth. No orna- ments. 2. Type of Pena da Velha. Mouth of cave partly obstructed by large stones. Mortuary caves with human bones. Ornaments few, axes few, flint blades abundant. Teeth (canis, felis) bored for suspension. Re- mains of cow, stag, pig, rabbit. 3. Type of CabePo da Ministra. Mouth of cave defended with stones rudely cemented. Rich in neolithic objects. Great variety of well and delicately made flint implements. Schist axes, adzes, etc. Many ornamental objects. Ornamented pottery. Flint implements, nuclei and refuse. Teeth (felis, canis) bored for suspension. 4. Type of Er- videira. Knowledge of panification and agriculture, grinding-mills of primi- tive type. Predominance of bone im- plements. Retouched flints rare. Pottery rude and unornamented. Simul- taneity of hunting and fishing life. Imperfect axes. Flints rare. 5. Type of Redondas. Copper implements. Stone implements rare. Pottery abun- dant with variety of form. Schist plates bored for suspension. 6. Type of Cabeyo dos Mosqueiros (lower). Im- plements and instruments few. Pottery curiously worked with wheel. Copper implements. 7. Type of Casa da Genia. Implements of iron. Remains*of large, thick pottery. Sculptures in bone. Of the fourth, sixth, and seventh types only one " station" each is known. In all 14 caves were investigated,- details of the finds in each, number of specimens, etc., are given. Pages 460-473 are oc- cupied by an ethnographical sketch of Alcobaga based upon the results of these investigations. The seven crania ob- tained from these "stations" and the few long-bones indicate a small-statured but strong-muscled people, generally dolichocephalic. The type of axe rep- resented in figure 236 the author con- siders unique. One of the most curious objects discovered (at the Casa da Genia cave) is a rude bone carving, apparently of a woman (fig. 232). At Cabego dos Mosqueiros some glass beads (Roman ?) were found. Nerucci (G.) Maramao! (Arch. p. 1. Stud. d. Trad. Pop., Palermo-Torino, 1901o, xx, 273-274.) The author con- siders this much discussed word to be "simply a folk-exclamation." It has nothing to do with the proper name Maramaldo. Norrby (R.) Nir blev Sverges befolk- ning i egentlig meningbofast ? (Svenska Landsmilen, Stockholm, 19i0, xIx, No. 4, 1-22.) Treats of the first per- manent settlement of Sweden as re- vealed by the terms for " village," " farmstead," etc. On page 22 the author gives his scheme of the develop- ment of these names. The contrast between the older names and the later, between the " flyttare " and the " bo- faste,"- the somewhat nomadic and the permanently settled,- is brought out. Oberg (S.)

Uma iconographia popular em azulejos. (Portugalia, Porto, 19o0, I, 585-590.) Treats, with io text- figures, of the pictures on tiles or pottery squares. - Os cercos. (Ibid., 623-624.) In con- nection with Coelho's recent study of similar rites, the author argues that the cdrcos, a sort of beating the parish bounds at Easter, until lately in use in many parts of Portugal, are relics of, or substitutions for heathen ceremonies concerned with the protection of the fields from evil spirits, noxious animals, etc. He agrees with Coelho in regard- ing the Rogation rites of the Christian church as an ecclesiastical substitution for the heathen ceremony. Picio (J. da S.) Ethnographia do Alto Alemtejo. (Ibid., 535-548.) This second section treats of the " montes," or isolated country habitations, which are one of the most notable characteris- tics of the trans-Tagan province. There are five classes of "montes." They are the residence-houses of large estates, and are like what are called in other provinces, granja, casa, quinta, etc. They consist of dwelling-houses, out-</page><page sequence="21">PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 329 Picao- Continued. buildings of various sorts, and some- times a chapel. From one point of view they are magazines of all that agriculture produces, a picturesque synthesis of Alemtejan country-life (man, beast, bird, etc.). They are also free inns for travelers and beggars, permanent refectories for all sorts of needs, asylums of the old and sick, homes of abandoned children, and re- fuges of the persecuted. Details of the various buildings, etc,, are given with 5 text-figures. Picco (F.) e Bollea (C.) Spigolature dal "Libro de los enxiemplos del Conte Lucanor et de Patronis" di Juan Manuel, s. xiv. Saggio di traduzione corredata di alcune annotazioni com- parative. (Arch. p. 1. Stud. d. Trad. Pop., Palermo-Torino, 1901, xx, 219- 244.) These "gleanings" consist of exempla I-v from the book of exempla of Juan Manuel (fourteenth century), known as " Libro de los enxiemplos del Conte Lucanor et de Patronis." The comparative notes are to be published in a subsequent issue. Pirez (A. T.) Amuletos. (Portugalia, Porto, 190o, I, 618-622.) A list of "pagan amulets " still in use among the people of Elvas and the reasons given for their employment by the populace today. Of the amulets in question 18 are for infants, 5 for lactation, 25 against diseases, dangers, etc. A brief description of each amulet is given. Pitri (G.) Modi proverbiali e motti storici di Palermo. Raccolti ed illus- trati. (Arch. p. 1. Stud. d. Trad. Pop., Palermo-Torino, I90or, xx, 387-408.) Historical and explanatory notes on 48 proverbial expressions and historical sayings from Palermo. Pommerol (F.) La fete des brandons et le dieu gaulois Grannus. (Bull. et Mim. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1901, ve s., II, 427-431.) Brief account of the ceremony of the Granno mio on the first Sunday of Lent in the Auvergne - " torch Sunday." From a bonfire (around which the people dance) at night straw-torches are lit, which are then passed under the trees, etc., with appropriate exclamatory verses. The characteristic accompaniment of the ceremony is the cry "Granno mio, Granno mon poubre, Granno mo mou- &amp;re" (" Grannus, my friend ; Grannus, my father ; Grannus, my mother.") Dr Pommerol considers that this ceremony is what remains of an ancient solar germ-cult, and would identify Granno with the Apollo Grannus to whom altars have been found dedicated in England and Alsace,- a Gaulish deity. This name he would connect with certain Celtic words for " sun " (Irish grian, Welsh greian), from which he also sug- gests the much discussed French word brillant may have been derived. von Preen (H.) Opferung aus Thon- kopfurnen in Haselbach bei Braunau am Inn und im Taubenbach. (Mitth. d. anthrop. Ges. in Wien, 19go, xxxI, 52-61.) Brief account, with 30 text- figures, of the pilgrim-shrine (Church of St Valentine) in Haselbach, near Braunau on the Inn, and the clay-heads offered up there for votive purposes. Also a description of similar votive of- ferings at Taubenbach in lower Bavaria. The author concludes that "we have here, both in Haselbach and in Tau- benbach, beyond a doubt, the continua- tion of an ancient cult, of which only the outward form has maintained itself until the present time." Raccuglia (S.) Proverbi e modi pro- verbiali riguardanti persone e paesi di Sicilia. (Arch. p. 1. Stud. d. Trad. Pop., Palermo-Torino, 1901, xx, 260- 262.)

Persone di cittadinanza itali- ana che parlano abitualmente in familia un idioma straniero, secondo i risultati del censimento generale della popola- zione del io febbraio 1901. (Atti. d. Soc. Rom. di Antr., 1901 [1902], viii,, 89-99.) Statistics of foreign-speaking population of Italy according to census. of 1901, with discussion of data. The number of families and individuals. (Italian citizens) habitually speaking a. foreign language was in 190o as fol- lows: Provengal French 19,005 (80,200), German 2,308 (II,4oo), Slavonic 5,868 (30,0ooo0), Albanian 21,564 (9o,ooo), Greek 7,4o08 (31,200), Catalan 2,055 (9,8oo). This makes a total of 58,208 families and 252,600o individuals, rep- resenting 178 communes. The mass of the French-Provengals are in Aosta, of the Slavs in Udine, of the Greeks in Lecce and Calabria. In Aosta the French-Provengal has preserved its im-</page><page sequence="22">330 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 4, 1902 Raseri- Continued. portance, but has diminished since 1861 in Pinerolo and Susa. There are two groups of Germans in Italy, the Pied- montese and the Venetian (relics of the 13 communes of Verona, etc.); the number of those speaking German in the Venetian region has decreased a half since the middle of the last century; the other German " island" seems to have increased. There are also two Slav- speaking groups, one in Friuli, the other in the Abruzzi ; the former has decreased since IS5i,-the one is Slo- venian, the other Servian. The in- crease from 55,453 in 1861 to 90,000 in 1901o of individuals speaking Alba- nian is due partly to natural increase and partly to the more careful census- taking of the past year. The same re- marks apply to the population speaking Greek. The Catalan element, confined to the city of Alghero (and environs) in Sardinia, is descended from a colony arriving in 1354 A.D., which was fa- vored during the long Spanish rule of the island. Counting transients at the date of the census the foreign-speaking population of Italy amounts to ca. I %. Reinach (S.) La station ndolithique de Jablanica, Serbie. (Anthropologie, Paris, 1901, xII, 527-533.) Brief ac- count, with 15 text-figures (terra-cotta figurines, pottery, etc.) of the "purely neolithic " station of Jablanica in Servia. This extensive archeological location was examined in September, 1900, by M. Vassits, now director of the new Museum at Belgrade. The most inter- esting specimens found are terra-cotta statuettes (more than 80o in number), dispersed in such a manner as to indi- cate that they belonged to the primitive household furniture of the cabins of these prehistoric people. While some of these figurines represent women and others animals (these are fewer and ruder), there appear to be none repre- senting the male form. The finds in general indicate that the station of Ja- blanica "constitutes a new link in the chain uniting Bosnia to the Troad and Phrygia, on the one hand, and, on the other, to Hungary and southwestern Russia." Over all this great area in neolithic times there existed "the same primitive civilization characterized by statuettes and pottery of almost identi- cal form and workmanship." Such secondary differences as are present may be attributed to the developments of local industries, and there is no need for the hypothesis of a unique center of manufacture and diffusion. The ethnic relationship of the creators of this primitive culture is not very clear. They may have been the ancestors or predecessors of the Thraco-Illyrians. - Un enicropole en Albanie. (Ibid., 662-670.) Brief account, with 22 text-figures, of the results of the in- vestigations (in 1898) of M. Degrand at the necropolis of Komani, not far from Skutari, in Albania, with descriptions of some of the bronze and silver objects there found. Riviire (E.) Les dessins graves de la grotte de la Mouthe, Dordogne. (Bull. et Mdm. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 19o01, ve s., II, 509-517.) Brief description, with 8 figures (bison, cow, reindeer, goats, mammoth, horses), of the rock sculptures of the Grotte de la Mouthe, Dordogne. See American Anthropolo- gist, 1902, IV, 164. Rossi (P.) I cicli nelle " rumanze." (Arch. p. 1. Stud. d. Trad. Pop., Pal- ermo-Torino, Igol, xx, 165-184.) This article is extracted from the author's work Le " rumanze" ed ii folklore in Calabria. According to Rossi, the rumanza is polycyclic. In these folk- tales there can be detected a Christian (naively ignorant and humorous), a Celtic (with fairies and goblindom), a human (redolent of everyday life and activities), a semi-heroic (akin to the Arthurian), and possibly an Arabian (re- flected from "The Thousand and One Nights") cycle. Sui generis are the rumanze di lugale, in which appears the countryman half-fool, half-thief, deceived today, tomorrow the trickster himself. When the rumanza treats of Christian topics it is in a happy vein. de Saint-Venant (M. J.) Dissemina- tion des produits des ateliers des Grand- Pressigny aux temps prehistoriques. (Anthropologie, Paris, ig9o, xii, 550- 555.) According to the author, who has carefully studied the subject, the area of distribution of Pressinian flint implements, representing the primitive industry of southern Touraine, does not include all of ancient Gaul, and the dis- tribution has taken place in three direc- tions chiefly,--(I) by the Loire valley to Brittany, (2) northward toward the Channel and Belgium, (3) eastward into Switzerland. The rejects are known</page><page sequence="23">PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 331 de Saint Venant-Continued. locally as livres de beurre. According to M. Rutot the flint deposits of Bel- gium furnish abundance of material identical with that of Grand-Pressigny. Salomone-Marino (S.)

Pop., Paler- mo-Torino, I9I01, xx, 267-272.) Gen- eral index of authors and subjects to the study of " Folktales in Sicilian Poetry since the Fifteenth Century," which has appeared in previous issues. Sampaio (A.) As "villas" do Norte de Portugal. (Portugalia, Porto, 1901, I, 549-584.) Continued from previous two numbers. This section (chapters ix-xii) of Sampaio's study of the "vil- las" of northern Portugal treats of the classes of the villa population, perma- nence of the villas, Neo-Visigoths (seig- neurs and farmers), transformation of the villas (petty proprietorship). Much interesting historical detail is given. de Sanctis (S.) e Toscano (P.) Le im- pronte digitali dei fanciulli normali, frenastenici e sordomuti. (Atti d. Soc. Rom. di Antr., 1901 [1902], viII, 62- 79.) After a general introduction the authors give in detail the results of the investigation of the finger-prints of 1o3 boys between 6 and 14 years of age, of whom 40 were pupils in an elementary school in Rome, 40 feeble-minded chil- dren (none complete idiots) from an Asilo-Scuola for the poor, and 23 deaf- mutes from the Royal Institution in Rome, all more or less developed in intelligence. The chief conclusionsar- rived at are: The feeble-minded and the deaf-mutes tend to have a simple and uniform (i. e. repeated on all Io fingers) design of finger-print,--sim- plicity of design is "the fundamental and typical anomaly and of certain de- generative significance." Anomalous forms abound in the feeble-minded and deaf-mutes, and both (the latter more than the former) present, in considerable proportion, the " uniformn-anomalous type" (uniformity of design on all fin- gers and anomalous form of this design). The so-called " radial opening" occurs in all three groups exclusively on the index-fingers, the finger which is physi- ologically most evolved. The article is accompanied by 4 tables and 9 text- figures. In connection with this paper should be read Vucetich's Conferencia sobre el Sistema dactiloscopico (La Plata, 1901). Sanfilippo (F.)

Archaeol., Norwood, Mass., I9o0, Sec. s., v, 404-417.) Describes, with two plates (24 figures) and 2 text-figures, numerous frag- ments of pithoi from Haghios Ilias and PriniA. The author considers these finds " a fresh and noteworthy contri- bution to the history of Greek pottery modelled in relief." Schukowitz (H.) Das Kellerrecht. (Ibid., 452-455.) Gives the text of a "wine-cellar law " of 1614 A.D., from a MS. in the author's possession. This "law" had long been kept in the Kinsky cellars at Matzen in Marchfeld. Schiilte (0.)

Archaol., Norwood, Mass., Igor, Sec. s., v, 418-436.) Historical and archeological notes (with 2 text- figures) on Phaestos, once mistress of the central part of the island of Crete, and a maritime city, with account of recent finds there, including a great mass of pottery fragments of both the rough and finer kinds. The ornamen- tal motifs, etc., are discussed. The author seeks to identify the Philistines with the Pelasgi, and the Pulasati of the Egyptians. Mt Ida, he thinks, was the center of the Pelasgic domination, and partly in possession of the Phaes- tians, who may have been numbered among the corsairs of the isles. - A visit to the grotto of Camares on Mt Ida. (Ibid., 437-451.) Ac- count, with 5 text-figures, of a visit in June, 1894, to the votive cavern, or Grotto of Camares, on the southern ridge of Mt Ida, "the religious center" of the extensive Phaestian dis- trict of Crete, and of the explorations there made. The pottery remains are of particular interest and are " charac- teristic of the successive stages of culture evolved in the island." Thieullen (A.) Os travaillis l&amp; 1'poque de Chelles. (Bull. et Mdm. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 19go, ve S., II, 347- 362.) In this paper, with 6 text-fig- ures, the author argues that man of the Chellean epoch already fashioned bones for his use.

Among the topics discussed are: Origin of the Lapps, their name, religion, drums, Christianity, church-service, courting and marriage, physical and mental characteristics, clothing, reindeer, travels, hunting, fishing, bird-catching, food, trade, etc. Traeger (P.) Ueber das Gewohnheits- recht der Hochlinder in Albanien. (Verh. d. Berl. Ges. f. Anthr., 1901, 352-363.)

Meetings of the whole tribe are held several times a year. Venturi (S.) La settimana santa in Cala- bria. (Arch. p. 1. Stud. d. Trad. Pop., Palermo-Torino, 190I, xx, 358-364.) Describes the ceremonies and festivi- ties of Holy Week in the villages of Calabria. Holy Thursday is a day of flagellations of "i battenti," as they are called, and imitations of all sorts of the Passion of Christ. On Holy Friday the scene changes and pleasures of the mind and the high suggestions of art are attended to. The drama of La Pigliata, a poem of the Passion, is re- cited. On Saturday the Cascata is performed, and on Easter Sunday the Confronta, in which is represented the happy and glorious meeting of Jesus with the Madonna. Virchow (R.) Sur un dpa6t des temps neolithiques, forme d'une coquille de Tritonium remplie d'aclats de silex taillus. (Anthropologie, Paris, 193O, XII, 565-567.)

(Portugalia, Porto, 1901, 1, 5[3-534.) In these contributions towards a collec- tion of Portuguese proverbs, the author cites 548 proverbs from the works of Gil Vicente (Nos. I-9I), Antonio Pres- tes (92-122), Antonio Ribeiro Chiado (I23-I96), Lope de Vega (197-336), a song-book of the I6th century (337- 363), a MS. of the I6th century belong- ing to the Monastery of Santa Cruz, Coimbra (364-547),-of these authori- ties the fourth and fifth are in Spanish. A collection of Adagios portuguez was published by Antonio Delicado at Lis- bon in 1651, which book the author uses as a basis of comparison. - As candeias na industria e nastra- diyges populares Portuguez. (Ibid., 629-631.) Additions to article in pre- vious number on lamps (candeias) in Portuguese popular industries and folk- lore. Volkov (T.) Kourgans et trouvailles arch(ologiques prAs du bourg de Smi6la. (Bull. et M6m. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 190o, ve S., I1, 424-425.) Resumes briefly the work of Count Bobrinsky, the results of which have been pub- lished in 3 volumes (1887, 1894, 1901). The field covered is the southern parts of the governments of Kiev and Pol- tava. The following periods are rec- ognized: I. Stone age. 2. Eneolithic (vii-vI centuries B.c., -appearance of bronze at close of neolithic period). 3. Scytho-kSarmatian (vI-i i centuries B.C.). 4. Period of Roman influence (i-iAll centuries A.D.). 6. Slavonic period (vi-ix centuries). 7. Byzantine influence, -period of Grand Dukes of Kiev (x-xii centuries). Flint imple- ments are rare in the Stone age,-nat- ural fragments, however, may have been used the Count thinks. In the Eneolithic period we meet with crouched burials, and the use of red ocher. The swastika he considers the conventional- ization of a flying bird. - Antiquitg s de la r(gion de Dnie- per. (Ibid., 421-422.) Briefly resumes the work of Mr and Mrs Khanenko on the archeology of the Dnieper region. The numerous remains treated of by these authors belong to the periods of Roman, Slavonic (?), Gothic, Sassa- nide, and central and eastern Asiatic influence. Among the relics noted is a bronze plate with a Tai-ki of the Song dynasty (1128-1278 A.D.). Vukasovic (V. V.) " Bugarilje" ovvero " Naricace" presso gli Slavi meridio- nali. (Arch. p. 1. Stud. d. Trad. Pop., Palermo-Torino, 1901, xx, 354-357.) Brief account of the bugarilje, or weep- ing women singers at funerals among the southern Slavs (Montenegrins). The texts of two "elegies" sung by such women are given,-of one both the Montenegrin and the Italian version.</page><page sequence="26">334 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 4, 1902 Weichel (Dr) Der Wall im Oberholz bei Thrina. (Verh. d. Berl. Ges. f. Anthr., 19go, 409-4II.) Brief account, with plan, of the " Ringwall" in the Oberholz near Thrina, made doubtless for purposes of defence-a sort of " city of refuge" for the people of this re- gion, dating back to pre-Slavonic times in Saxony. Winkler (H.) Das Finnenthum der Magyaren. (Ztschr. f. Ethnol., Ber- lin, 1901, xxxIII, 157-171.) After briefly discussing the various theories as to the origin of the Magyars of Hun- gary, particularly Bilint's attempt (on linguistic grounds chiefly) to make them out to be Dravidians, Dr Winkler indicates the results of his very recent studies of the pure Magyar type of the Alfold region, which represents, he thinks, the pre-migrational Magyar stock. Elsewhere in Hungary the Magyars are a very mixed people-- primitive Altaic, Huns, and Avars, " Turks," together with Slavs of all sorts, Roumanians, Italians, Teutons, have all contributed their share,-and can hardly be taken as the earliest type of the race. According to Dr Winkler, the investigation of the Al- fold Magyars proves anthropologically and ethnologically even more than lin- guistically their relationship to the East-Finnic stock of Ural-Altaic peo- ples,-the Magyar proper is a rather pure Finn so far as type is concerned. Before their settlement in central Eu- rope the Magyars were influenced by Turkic, Iranic, and Mongol peoples, for after their separation from their Finnish cognates, they wandered east- ward as a "steppe-people," where these and other contacts took place. Dr Winkler thinks that B6lint's demon- stration of Magyar-Dravidian relation- ship (the Magyars are not Dravidians) and certain Caucasic elements in the Magyar tongue are to be explained from the points of contact in pre-Euro- pean days. Thus Turkic, Iranian, Mongol, Dravidian, and Caucasic ele- ments exist in Magyar. Some of the questions here broached are to be fur- ther considered in Dr Winkler's forth- coming work, Die uralaltaischen Sprachen. Zaborowski (M.) Portraits de la Ven- dee, des Deux-Sevres, de la Vienne. (Bull. et Mom. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1901, ve S., II, 403-404.) Calls atten- tion to the value for ethnography (head- dresses, etc.) of the portraits of women on illustrated postal cards. Many pho- tographic collections of peasant types have also been made. Zanardelli (T.) I nomi etnici nella toponomastica. (Atti d. Soc. Rom. di Antr., g190 [1902], vIIi, 100-113.) Discusses names of places and persons in Italy derived from ethnic appella- tions, directly or indirectly, popular and literary. Italia itself is such a name. The various modes of forma- tion of such words are enumerated. Among the ethnic names whose deriva- tives in Italy are treated more or less at length are: Boil, Dani, Burgundi (Burgondiones), Suevi, Bulgari, Un- gari, Baschi, Frisii (Frisiones, etc.), Germani, Sarmati, etc. The number of such names is very large. Names like Africanus, Germanicus, " richer spoils than the peoples themselves," traveled far from their home, when Ro- man conquerors took them with them. The etymology of some names is of interest as showing the difficulties of the study of such words. The Pergin- ese Germans were nicknamed by their Italian neighbors Mdcheni, from their frequent use of the verb machen. One can easily see, that, if they had made their appearance in remote times, these Mdcheni would have been an ethnic puzzle for later etymologists. There are many curious facts in this article. Zemmrich (J.) Das deutsche Sprachge- biet in Stid und Ostb6hmen. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1901, LXXX, 345-356.) A detailed historical-ethnographical ac- count, with map, of the German lan- guage in southern and eastern Bohemia. The most remarkable section of (,er- man speech in this region is the "lin- guistic island" of Budweis, begun by Swabian immigrants in the I3th cen- tury. Interesting also is the "lin- guistic island " of Iglau. This paper is a useful contribution to the literature of the Teuto-Slav linguistic conflict in central Europe. The author is moved by a strong patriotic spirit on behalf of the 18o,ooo Germans here considered. AFRICA Buschan (G.) Zur Pathologie der Neger. (Arch. p. l'Antrop., Firenze, 1901, xxxI, 357-375.)

The author is of opinion that the negro has a special race rela- tion in the matter of pathology, and that other races also have their own characteristics with respect to disease. The negro enjoys a greater or less im- munity from malarial and yellow fever, abdominal typhus, erysipelas, scarlet fever, complications resulting from ac- cidental wounds, trachoma, carcinoma, (less for sarcoma), varicocele, hyper- trophy of prostate, bladder and gall stones, ovarial tumors, hare-lip, spina bifida, cleft palate, chorea, melan- cholia, tabes, chronic delirium (Mag- nan). More than the white the negro suffers from tuberculosis, dermoid cysts, aneurism, tetanus, mania, dementia paralytica. The so-called" sleepy sick- ness" seems to be a specific neurosis of the African race. Before the entrance of the negro into the social life of the whites idiocy appears to have been (as in Africa) the form of nervous disease occurring, but now most of the forms known among the whites are found among the negroes as well. The author rejects the idea recently current that the immunity of the negro for malaria is not primary, but acquired through a slight infection in childhood. Pages 372-375 are occupied by a bibliography of 81 titles. Etnografia Africana. (Arch. p. 1. Stud. d. T'rad. Pop., Palermo-Torino, g9l, xx, 409-411.)

Das Fetischdorf Avhegame und seine Bewohner auf dem Aguberge in Deutsch-Togo. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1901, LXXX, 377-384.) Somewhat de- tailed account, with 4 text-figures, of the fetish-village of Avhegame on Mt Agu in the German Togo country,- the natives belong to the Erve stock, who permit both men and women to be shamans. The priests are law-givers and dictate the times of sowing and harvest. Their "pulpit" is a large rock. The author's visit took place in December, 1897. Lately this fetish- village has been losing in vogue and importance, with the increasing activity of the missionaries. Flamand (G. B. M.) Les pierres ecrites (Hadjrat mektoubat) du nord de 1' Afrique et specialement de la r6gion d' In-Salah. (Anthropologie, Paris, 190o, XII, 535-538.) Brief abstract, with discussion, of paper read at Congress of Igoo. The stations at which exist hadjrat mektoubat (" written stones"), or rock-engravings, in northern Africa, as reported by the author, number some 54, not including those of the north- east where 700 figures have been studied by him. The prehistoric (neolithic) rock-sculptures contain figures of ani- mals some of which no longer exist in that part of the world, while the later or Libyco-Berber contain inscriptions in alphabetical characters and repre- sentations of animals living still in the country, or farther south. Grogan (E. S.) Through Africa from the Cape to Cairo. (Ann. Rep. Smith- son. Inst., Igoo, Wash., 1901, 431-448.)

Brief general account based on The Natives of South Africa, published by the South African Committee (the in- vestigation began in 1899gg). Between 189I and 1898 the Bantu population has increased 35%, while the Bushmen and Hottentots have fallen off about r.8%. In British South Africa there are nearly 4,000,000 blacks and other " colored" people. Of the Bantus it may be said "contact with peoples more advanced in evolution than them- selves, far from being fatal to them, has actually increased their vigor and vitality." They are evidently destined to rise rapidly to a state of culture that will give them an important po- sition in the future development of this part of the world. An interesting sec- tion of the South African world is formed by the 14,000 Malays imported from the East Indies, who have mixed with the other natives, but retain their creed of Islam. There are also many coojies from Hindustan. - Les Vaalpens. (Ibid., 411-414.)

Their habitat is the bend of the Limpopo and they are said to be physically, linguistically and culturally sui generis. Their own name is Kattea. They are a species of dwarfs and "may be considered the aborigines of South Africa." But much more information is needed. Hutter (D.) Westafrikanisches Stations- leben.

Brief sketch of the character of the Bantu Negro of wes- tern Africa and the way to treat him. Among the bad qualities noted by Captain Hutter are idleness (lack also of idea of time and its value), ingrati- tude, greed, and the vices due to the development of his essentially commer- cial and speculative nature. On the good side may be reckoned good- naturedness, dependence, sense of hu- mor, keen observation-gift, etc. In dealing with him seriousness (with play of humor), justice, impartiality, pa- tience, veracity, personality are all needed and necessary for more or less complete success. Laidlaw (G. E.) Some ethnological ob- servations in South Africa. (Amer. Antiq., Chicago, 1902, xxIv, 77-84.) Notes on Zulus and Kaffirs made dur- ing service with the British army in I9oo-IgoI. The Zulus " are mentally, morally and physically, the superior native people of South Africa." Their sexual morality and the virtue of their women are noteworthy. In many ways the Zulus are " the gentlemen of South Africa." To the "blanket Indian" of North America corresponds the " red Kaffir," who still lives the old, wild life to a large extent. Between the "red Kaffir" and the civilized, settled negro, there exists a semi-civilized class, who live by intermittent work for the whites. " Kitchen Dutch" (the lan- guage used when addressing negro ser- vants and white people), the author says, with some libel of the Canadien- Frangais, "bears the same relation to high Dutch, that the French Canadian 'habitant patois' does to Parisian French." The 'rickshaw men of Dur- ban are Zulus. Olshausen (Dr) Aegyptische hausurn- enihnliche Thon-Gefdsse. (Verh. d. Berl. Ges. f. Anthr., I901, 424-426.) The author calls attention to the re- semblance between two clay vessels from ancient Egypt (figured in Petrie's Diospolis par'a) and certain old Danish and German "hut urns." The Egyp- tian vessels are thought to be models of granaries,-and some of the German " hut urns" may have a similar origin. The Egyptian vessels in question be- long to the first half of the second mil- lennium B.C., much earlier than the earliest known Teutonic "hut urns."

Brief account, with 2 text- figures, of some images in talc-schist from the Mendi country in the south of Sierra Leone, and another similar im- age from the island of Bulama (Bissa- yos). The last represents rudely the female form. The Mendi images are said to be buried in fields as protection for crops, etc. The heads are hollowed out so that they may be filled with grain, seeds, etc. Seidel (H.) Kbrperverunstaltungen im Siiden Deutsch-Ostafrikas. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1901, LXXX, 290-292.) Treats, with 2 text-figures, of bodily mutilations,-scar-tattooing, filing and knocking out of teeth, boring of lips, ears, nose, etc.,-among the Bantu tribes of the southern regions of Ger- man East Africa. Tattooing is in vogue for esthetic purposes and also for an interesting sexual reason in the case of women. With the huntsman it is for luck. The patterns preferred differ considerably with the various tribes. The pelele is more common with women. With the Wagogo the ear-ornament carried in the perforation serves as a sort of pocket for snuff and the like. The clay-ball head-dress of the Wakinga (figured on page 291) is remarkable. Mutilations for punish- ment are corfiparatively rare. Sergi (G.) Crani arabi. (Atti d. Soc. Rom. di Antr., I901 [1902], viii, 80- 88.)

Of these skulls (14 are male) some are from Algiers, others from Arabia. All except two (82.8, 89.4) are dolichocephalic and meso- cephalic. The cranial capacity ranges from 1205 to 1595 cc. As to form 16 are "ellipsoid," ii "ovoid," and 2 " sphenoid." The two brachycephalic skulls Sergi considers "foreign and Asiatic, with Mongolian characters, like those so common in the population of central Europe (Slavs, Teutons, Celts)." The average skull-capacity (1365 5) is not large and the skulls are heavier and not so well-formed as those of the Mediterranean race. The as- pect of the face is dolicho-ellipsoidal. Virchow (R.) Bildtafeln aus igypt- ischen Mumien. (Verh. d. Berl. Ges. f. Anthr., 1901, 259-265.) Brief ac- count (from letters) of Th.

There is a striking likeness between some of the old Egyptian portraits and those on coins of the Ptolemies. The paper is illustrated by 4 text-figures, 2 of which represent Cleopatra. Weeks (J. H.)

La donna fra i Basuto. (Arch. p. 1'Antrop., Firenze, 1901, xxxI, 459-478.) Brief account of the position and activities of woman among the Basuto, as an individual, in the family, in society, and in relation to re- ligion. Birth, name-giving, puberty and initiation, clothing and ornament, are referred to, the ceremonies of the puberty-period being given with some detail. Old maids are very rare (polyg- amy is common). On pages 469-470 the author tells of a real love-romance of which he was himself a witness. The account of marriage is also rather detailed. The childless wife is in sad case (several cures for this are noted). To bear all boys is a sort of financial disgrace, since girls are a sort of femi- nine capital (there is a " cure " for this also). Besides prostitution, the careers of the prophet and the exercise of civil power(as chief even) are open to women. According to the author the pagan Basuto woman manifests no more re- ligiosity than the man, but after accept- ing Christianity sincerely "she shows herself capable of a delicacy of con- science and an elevation of feeling, which make her the worthy rival of her white coreligionists." The Basuto Christian churches contain two men for one woman. The author seems to think that the greater freedom of wo- men under Christianity accounts for some of this. Zaborowski (M.) De l'influence de l'ancienne civilisation gyptienne dans l'Afrique occidentale. (Bull. et Mim. Soc. d. Anthr. de Paris, 1901, ve s., II, 323-326.) Brief note and discus- sion - the paper has appeared in the Revue de l'Ecole d'Anthropologie (see American Anthropologist, 1901, III, 782.) In the discussion MM. Verneau and Delisle seemed favorable to the idea of ancient Egyptian influence in West Africa. ASIA Adler (B.) Der nordasiatische Pfeil. Ein Beitrag zur Kenntnis der Anthro- pogeographie des asiatischen Nordens. (Int. Arch. f. Ethnogr., Leiden, 190O, XIV, suppl., 1-40.) In this valuable monograph, accompanied by 8 plates (ca. 200 figures) and a distribution-map, the author treats of the arrow among the peoples of northeastern Asia: Gen- eral character, material, weight and size, notch, fastening of point, orna- mentation, poison, forms of the point, position of the point with respect to the notch, feathering (coast form, Aino type, Bering Sea form, Siberian and South-Siberian or Kirghiz form), etc. The author agrees with Ratzel and others in considering the arrow to be older than the bow, since it is a de- velopment from a weapon hurled from the hand (a throw-arrow). T-he north- ern arrow is a product of N. E. Asia and N. W. America,-quite possibly it originated with the Eskimo and was by them transferred to N. E. Asia. The Eskimo-arrow too recalls that of the European Stone age. As now extant the North-Asiatic arrow is somewhat degenerate. The Finnic peoples, by reason of their contact with the Slavs, have more or less given up their old weapons, while the Turkic group of the</page><page sequence="30">338 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 4, 1902 Adler--Continued. Mongolian stock have developed them farther (Yakuts, Mantchu, and Kirghiz especially). The migrations of the vari- ous peoples of northern Asia and their contact with tribes to the south have had some influence upon their arrows. The Aino, Adler regards as a people of southern origin and inclines to agree with Peschel's theory that they are " a Mongolian branch of the Negritos of the Philippines." Aristov' (N.) Etnitcheskiya otnocheniya na Pamirye, etc. (Russk. Antrop. Zhur., Moskva, I9go, ii, No. 2, 33-61.) Continued from previous volume. This fourth chapter of the author's ethno- graphical study of the natives of Pamir according to ancient Chinese and other historical documents deals with Chinese documents of the period from the fifth to the eighth century,-the Annals of the Yuen-Wei and Tan Dynasties, and the accounts of Buddhist travelers to India (Fa-hsien in particular). Belck (W.) Mittheilungen tiber arme- nische Streitfragen. (Verh. d. Berl. Ges. f. Anthr., 1901, 284-328.) Largely a reply to criticisms of Dr Lehmann regarding the cuneiform inscriptions at the source of the Tigris and other mat- ters connected with the Armenian Ex- pedition. Delitzsch (F.) Discoveries in Mesopo- tamia. (Ann. Rep. Smithson. Inst. 1900o, Wash., 1901, 535-549.) This article, illustrated with io plates, is translated from the author's Ex Oriente Lux (Berlin, 1898). Drummond (R. J.) The rice-harvest in Ceylon. (Folklore, Lond., I901, xu, 457-458.) Brief account of an annual ceremony of the Tamil and the "rice- thrashing" of the Singhalese. The former is the expression of the belief that " after the rice is harvested, the 'god must be killed,' and a new god found like a new born baby come to life, and it must be found, or' the great rain' will not come, and the sowing of rice will fail." Fridolin (J.) Burjiten-und Kalmlicken- schldel. (Arch. f. Anthr., Brnschwg., 1901, xxvII, 303-316.) This article, which is illustrated with 14 plates con- taining 56 figures of crania, gives measurements and descriptions of I6 Buriat and 29 Kalmuck skulls from the collection of the Imperial Academy of Sciences, St Petersburg. The Buriat male skulls have an average cephalic index of 83.6 (range 79.5-89.7), the Kalmuck male skulls 81.2 (range 73.1- 86.8), female 82.9 (range 80.0-86.2). From this it appears that the Buriats are somewhat more brachycephalic than the Kalmucks. Among the most inter- esting specimens are 4 skulls of Buriat shamans and one of a Kalmuck prophet- ess, the peculiarities of which would be useful to Lombroso. Gorostchenko (K.) SoYoty. (Russ. Antrop. Zhur., Moskva, I901, In, No. 2, 62-73.) A brief account of the Soyotes, the Ne-yang-hai of the Chinese, a Mon- golian people of the Sajan-Altai region, usually classed with the Samoyeds, with anthropometric details of 72 male (18- 74 years) and 20 female (20-71 years) subjects. The average stature of the men is 1597 (range 1494-1709) and of the women 1512 mm. (range 1425- 1569). The average cephalic index of the men is 83.03 (range 76.03-92.13), of the women 82.57s(range 77.25-89.59). The author seems to think they ap- proach in some respects the Turkic type. von Hahn (C.) Sitten und Gebriuche in Imeritien. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1901, LXXX, 302-306.) Treats of wed- ding-customs, usages in sickness, death and burial, festivals, etc., superstitions, witchcraft, fortune-telling, among the Imers, a Georgian people of the Cau- casus. According to Dr von Hahn " the Mongolian yoke has left its deep- est impression in Imeritia upon the re- lations between husband and wife." Though the Christianity of the Imers dates from the 4th century, the su- perstitions and practices of the common people perpetuate a number of ancient heathen beliefs,- e. g., the placating of the batonebi (" Lord"), or invisible spirit of disease and sickness. The mountain of Tabakela, near Choni, is a regular " witch-hill." Water-sprites and wood-monsters also abound. Huntington (E.) Weitere Berichte tiber Forschungen in Armenien und Commagene.

An inter- esting account, well-illustrated with 35 text-figures, of the travels and investi- gations of Messrs Huntington and Knapp in Armenia, etc., during the fall of Igoo and the spring of Igor. Among the topics treated are: The</page><page sequence="31">PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 339 Huntington- Continued. Chaldic ruins and cuneiform inscrip- tions at Baghin, the castles at Mazgerd (in pure Chaldic style), Murad-lai, Per- tag, Gerger, Harput, the inscription of Izoly, etc. In the east wall of the church at Baghin is a basaltic block with Chaldic inscriptions on both sides. The kurgan-like mounds of Mazgerd are noted. The building and use of the kelek, the primitive vessel of this region are illustrated on pages 184-185. Of peculiar interest and importance is the Chaldic castle in the Murad-6ai be- tween Achar and its mouth,-- "a re- markable monument of military and architectural technique." The ancient Assyrians must have used the kelek, as the fishermen do today. A few notes on the Armenians and Kizil-bas are given, and on page 194 is a picture of one of the latter crossing the Euphrates on a burguk, or inflated skin, just as figured on the old inscriptions. Of the sculpture of the lions on the rocks near Uytik the author says the attitude and form recall those of Mycenae. The double nomenclature and religious life of the young people of part of the region in question is very interesting. Lehmann (C. F.) Ueber die chaldische Inschrift auf dem Bingol-dagh. (Verh. d. Berl. Ges. f. Anthr., 1901, 422- 424.) Brief account of the Bing6l-dagh cuneiform inscription, which, the au- thor tells, is no "myth " as some have thought was the case. A brief list of new Chaldic inscriptions is added. Mainov (I. I.) Dva tipa Tungusov. (Russk. Antr. Zhur., Moskva, 1901o, II, No. 2, 1-16.) In this article, with 4 text-figures, the author treats of the two different physical types, the northern and the southern, present among the Tungus of northeastern Siberia. The northern type is described as small- statured, mesocephalic, with retreating forehead and chin, broad and short nose, and yellowish-white skin; the southern is medium-statured, sub-doli- chocephalic, with prominent nose (straight or concave) and cheek-bones, and brownish-yellow skin. The usual measurements are given with some de- tail of tables, etc. The subjects num- bered about Ioo. The range of stature of the men was I486-I776, of the women (Io in number) I457-1607 mm. Maslovskii (S.) Gal'tcha. (Ibid., I7- 32). A general discussion of the Gal- chas, a primitive Aryan people of Turkestan. The author seeks to dis- tinguish among them five types: Arab, Jewish, Slavonic, Armenian, and East- ern Iranian. In the table of measure- ments are given the averages of 381 Tadjiks of the plain, 42 of the East- Iranian (mountain) type, 46 of the Arab (mountain 29, plains, 17) type, and 13 of the Jewish type. The Jewish type of the plains seems to have the highest average stature (1780 mm. for 41 individuals), the Arab type of the plains the lowest (1637 for 17 indi- viduals,)- the 18 Afghans measured averaged 1638, and the author classes them with the Jewish type. The mountain Arab type is taller (1664 for 29 individuals) than that of the plains. The most brachycephalic is the moun- tain East-Iranian type (89.I for 42 in- dividuals), the least the Arab type of the plains (82.1). The author is of opinion that among the Galchas we have " isolated" the diverse elements which have combined to form the Tad- jiks of the Iranian-Turkestan region. On page 23 a brief comparative vocabu- lary is given. Myrial (Alexandra) Les mantras aux Indes. (Bull. et M6m. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1901, ve S., II, 404-4II.) Brief account of the mantras or for- mulae recited, chanted, or sung in a set fashion in order to obtain certain physi- cal or psychical effects. They may be used to make or stop rain, cause the wind to blow, cure or cause disease, make flocks prosper, cause springs to burst forth, charm animals, aid or pre- vent conception, obtain the favor of deities, in fact for almost anything, for their number is legion. They are used to produce all sorts of psychical effects as well,- to aid meditation. Often the sound alone is efficacious, all knowledge of the sense of the formula having long ago disappeared.

Note volanti sui Karaciai ed alcune misure di Abash, Kabardini e Abasekh. (Arch. p. l'Antrop., Fir- enze, 1901, XXXI, 413-457.) In this article, with ?4 text-figures, Dr Som- mier gives the results of his visit in 189o among the Karatcai, Abas6, Kabar- dines, and Abasekh of the Caucasus. Anthropometric details of 21 Karatcai men, 32 Swanetians (men 26), 23 Abasa men, 6 Kabardine men, and one Aba- sdkh are included in this valuable paper. The hands were given special attention. The Karatcai (some 20,000 in number) inhabit the western slope of Elbruz. They are Mohammedans, and their vil- lages " reminded me specially of the au'l of the Tatars of the Baraba steppe in Siberia." Many traces of Mongolian blood are indeed discernible. Others resemble the Georgian, others still the Semitic type. Their language belongs with that of the Nogai and the Ader- baidjani. Notes on domestic life, dress, industries, etc., follow. The average stature of the Karatcai is 1675 mm., of the Swanetians (men 1695, women 1540), of the Abasi 1690, of the Ka- bardines 1,720. The cephalic index of the 23 Abasa was 82.5 (range 76.7- 87-4), of the Kabardines 83.1, of 21 Karatcai 84.44 (range 80.9-90.0). Williams (F. W.) Chinese folklore and some western analogies. (Ann.

After comparing the Chi- nese and Japanese accounts of creation the author cites analogies between the folklore of China and that of the Occi- dent such as the story of Ko-ai (cp. " Swan Maidens"), the feather-dress motif, the wife tested, the girl and the dragon, the fairy islands of the East (cp. Hesperides, etc.), long sleeps (Rip van Winkle), " judgments of Solomon," name-sanctity, euphemisms, female de- mons (Lilith), demonology, witchcraft, soul-wanderings, etc. Wu Ting Fang.

Treats, with I plate, of the transition from plaiting to weaving with special refer- ence to the art of weaving in Melanesia. Plaiting requires no special apparatus, but the first necessity of weaving is the formation of a warp by means of a tenter-frame. The primitive tenter- frame is not unlike a bow,-around this the warp is wound. This primi- tive apparatus comes from the Nissan or Sir Charles Hardy group in the "blackest" part of Melanesia. Dr Danneil calls attention to the fact that "all points in Melanesia from which weaving is known as yet, belong to the frontier regions of Melanesia towards the lighter colored peoples of the Pa- cific."</page><page sequence="33">PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 341 Giuffrida-Ruggeri (V.)

Besides Chinese and Europeans (with their followers) the natives of Sarawak consist of the following groups : Punan (and other nomadic hunter tribes) in the interior; Kalamantan (numerous agricultural communities) found over a large portion of the district; Kenyah- Kayan (powerful and well-organized groups, whose ancestors are said to have migrated from Dutch Borneo sev- eral centuries ago), occupying the best tracts of land between the swampy low country and the mountains at the river-sources; Ibans, or " Sea Dayak" (on the lower reaches of the rivers,- they are rapidly extending themselves) ; Malay (the true Orang Malayu in scattered places along the coast and a short distance up a few of the rivers,-- the Malay traders, however, have pene- trated farther). The Punan " are one of the most primitive and least ad- vanced tribes in Borneo, but they are very gentle savages." Pulo Kalaman- tan, " the island of the Kalamantan," is one of the Malay names of Borneo. The Kenyah-Kayan are expert boat- men ; they smelt iron, and make excel- lent sword blades and spear-heads. In language, decorative art, etc., the Iban differ considerably from the other groups, and, according to Hose, are related to the original Malays. The Malays of Sarawak have mixed a good deal with the coast peoples. On pages 344-347 are given the head-measure- ments of 274 natives of Sarawak, and on pages 349-351 the particulars of 80o crania of each of which the history is known. A table of statures is also given on page 351. The anthropo- metric and cranial data agree on the whole very well. The Moloh and Sebop of the Kalamantan group are dolichocephalic, the Melanan brachy- cephalic. The general tendency of the Kalamantan is to be dolichocephalic, of the Iban to be brachycephalic, both with a long range. The Kayan and Punans are "distinctly mesaticephalic and low brachycephalic," while the mixed group of the Kenyah " extends nearly along the whole scale." The Punan are of low stature (average 1555 mm.), rather taller than the Kenyah (1541) and rather shorter than the Kayan (1559). The average stature of the Iban is 1590 mm. The ethnologi- cal history of Sarawak begins with the nomadic, hunting savages of whom the Punans, Ukits, etc., are the modern representatives. About the same time, or somewhat later, came the Kalaman- tan, who mixed with the Punan, and again with the immigrant Kenyah- Kayan. Another invasion of brachy- cephals, from the west, came in the Iban, who were followed by the brachy- cephalic Malays. The other inva- sions of Borneo have not added new races. So far as Sarawak is concerned "the Hindu influence was almost en- tirely cultural.'" Of the presence of Negritos in Borneo no authoritative evidence is forthcoming. For the East Indian Archipelago in general Profes- sor Haddon recognizes, apart from the Negritos, Melanesians, and later immi- grants from the Asiatic mainland, the existence of "two races or distinct varieties of man,"-the Indonesians (dolichocephalic) and proto-Malays (brachycephalic). For a thousand years these in varying mixtures have been the real peoples of the islands. Laville (A.) Vase canaque. (Bull. et Mim. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 19or, ve s., II, 402.) Brief account of an earthen vessel from the Caket tribe of New Caledonia. The "teats" of the vessel recall those of certain neolithic pottery. In French canaque is applied to the natives of New Caledonia. Lissauer (A.) Ueber die Anthropolo- gie der Anachoreten- und der Duke of York-Inseln. (Verh. d. Berl. Ges. f. Anthr., 1901, 367-389.) In this ar- ticle, with 2 plates and a table of cranial measurements, the author de- scribes in detail 9 skulls (male 5, female 4) of natives of the Hermit islands, near the Equator to the north of the New Britain group; also a deformed</page><page sequence="34">342 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 4, 1902 Lissauer- Continued. skull (index 85) frpm Mioko in the Duke of York group. Of the Her- mit Islands skulls 6 are mesocephalic, 2 brachycephalic, and I dolicho- cephalic. Pages 367-371 are occupied with a general anthropological discus- sion of the subject, and pages 371-375 by an excursus on Sergi's taxonomic method of cranial investigation. Be- sides the 9 skulls here treated of in detail there are 6 others in the Luschan collection in the Museum fir V1lkerkunde, Berlin. Physically the Hermit islanders differ in certain re- spects from the Papuans, while their language, according to Kubary, is akin to that of the natives of Samoa and the Carolines. The Papuan customs of boring the septum of the nose and slit- ting the ear (in women) occur among them. Out of the 15 skulls 14 are bored just above the orbit, probably for purposes of suspension, in accordance with the skull-cult so widespread in Melanesia. In the Hermit islands the body is burnt, but the skull, with flowers in the eye-sockets, is hung up on a tree. Altogether these islanders are Polynesian rather than Melanesian. Sergi's chief error, Dr. Lissauer thinks, is that he has taken individual varia- tions for race-characters. Deformation of the skull is mentioned neither by Schellong nor Krause as practiced on the Duke of York island, so the case here discussed seems new. This skull has also traces of having been painted red. Mathews (R. H.) Organisation sociale des tribus aborigines de l'Australie. (Bull. et M m. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 19o01, ve s., 11, 415-419.) Brief ac- count of the social organization of the Yungmunni tribe of the Northern Ter- ritory of Australia. According to the author, "marriage, relationship, and the line of descent among the Austra- lian tribes depends principally on the father. " Modigliani (E.) Piccolo contributo alla conoscenza dei canti popolari malesi. (Arch. p. l'Antrop., Firenze, 19iO, xxxI, 381-401.) After a brief general introduction, chiefly concerned with the fantdn (pantoum), the author gives a pantoum-series (49 quatrains) obtained by him orally in Malaysia. The Malay text and Italian version are given, also specimens of the music (opposite page 388). These verses belong to the sim- ple poetry of the people, and remind one of the performances of the Italian improvvisatori, particularly the stornelli of the Tuscans. Some of the pantoums, in old Malay, are known all over the archipelago. The first pantoum pub- lished in Europe is to be found in Mars- den's History of Sumatra (London, 18II) and is reproduced by the author. The authenticity of a pantoum cited by Ragusa-Moleti in his Poesie dei popoli selvaggi (Palermo, 1891) is shown by Modigliani who came across the Malay original. The words signd, "a half-breed Dutchman (Dutch father, Malay mother)," bdba, " children of foreign Asiatics (particularly Chinese) born in Malaysia," entcic, " Malaysian descendants of Bengalese," are worth noting here. Powys (A. O.) Data for the problem of evolution in man. Anthropological data from Australia. (Biometrika, London, 1901, I, 30-49.) Treats, with 8 tables and II curves, of fertility of man and woman in relation to age, correlation between duration of life and number of offspring, stature of man be- tween the ages of 15 and 85, alteration of stature with old age. In New South Wales there is a more rapid develop- ment of women, due, perhaps, to the warmer climate. The statistics seem to indicate that " for the Anglo-Saxon race the view of Korosi that the fertility is greater the younger the wife is not cor- rect " (p. 34). Extreme longevity is not in all cases conducive to maximum re- productivity. The interesting fact is brought out here that "a new com- munity like New South Wales, with plenty of food and occupation for all, is seen to resemble an old community like England in this relationship, and not a new community like America." As to stature the tendency is towards increased variability with old age. Man seems to reach his maximum stature at 28, woman at 25, and the age of maximum fertility approaches, if it does not coincide with the age of maximum stature. Pulle (A. W.) Een Atjehsch wapen. (Int. Arch. f. Ethnogr., Leiden, 1901, XIv, 238-239.)

G. F.) Ueber die sogenann- ten Mongolen-Flecke der Kinder. (Verh. d. Berl. Ges. f. Anthr., 1901, 393.) Brief note recalling the fact that the author had seen the " Mongolian spots " in Celebes children and else- where in Indonesia; also in a Papuan girl. Scharlau (B.) Beschreibung von 5 minn- lichen und 3 weiblichen Australierbec- ken. (Anat. Anz., Jena, 1901, XX, 380-385.) Brief description, with de- tails of measurements of 8 pelves of Australians now in the Grassi Museum, Leipzig. They had been partly meas- ured and studiedby Prochowink in 1887. It is doubtful if all the pelves represent full-blood natives, since they come from a part of the N. E. coast, where inter- mixture with whites is known to have taken place. Of the pelves in question 3 are dolichopellic, 3 mesatipellic, and 2 platypellic. These 8 pelves (the au- thor intends making a study of a series of 58 others) are hardly to be taken as a norm for the Australians. Schulze (F.) Der Mensch in den Tro- pen. (Verh. d. Berl. Ges. f. Anthr., 1901, 394-400.) General discussion of the subject based upon 43 years' resi- dence in the East Indies and many journeys through and through the Malay archipelago. The article was called forth by an essay by Dr J. Myleus in Vol. xx of Vom Fels zum Meer, with many of the statements in which Capt. Schulze finds himself in entire disagreement. Capt. Schulze takes a much more favorable view of the residence and labor of Europeans in the tropics, physically, mentally, and morally. The order of capacity for acclimatization in the Malay archipel- ago is: Germans, Portuguese, Spaniards, French, Italians, Dutch, and, last of all, English,- they persist in being "too English" for one thing. European colonization in general and the acclima- tization of Europeans in the tropics he considers very possible. More labor, he thinks, is performed by Europeans in the Indies than is generally believed. The chief requisites for health in the Indies are proper and sufficient food, rest after exertion, and a minimum of alcohol. It must be admitted, however, that the author's views are rather rosy. The firewalk ceremony in Tahiti. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1901, xII, 446-447.) Reprint (with plate from photograph) of Professor Langley's account of Papa -Ita in Nature for Aug. 22, 1901, Andrew Lang's comments in the Morn- ing Post for Sept. 21, and a resum6 of Mr F. Davey's observations in the Wide World for June, 1901. The photograph is reproduced from the last and represents the exhibition given by Papa-Ita at Honolulu, January 19, 1901. Yamasaki (N.) Ein Besuch in den KopfjigerdBrfern auf Formosa. (Mitth. d. anthrop. Ges. in Wien, 90go, xxxI, 23-37.) Brief account, with 24 text- figures of which 14 reproduce native drawings, of a visit in December, 1896, among the tattooed head-hunters, - the Taiyal as they call themselves (the Seiban, or "raw barbarians" of the Chinese),- of the northern half of the central mountain-chain of Formosa. The village of H6g6, its inhabitants, houses, skull-frames, tattooing, cloth- ing, weaving, food, drawings, etc., are described. Pages 34-37 contain a Ger- man-Taiyal and a Taiyal-German vocabulary of some 225 words. The village of Plran was also visited. The friendliness shown by the Taiyal to the Japanese, the author thinks, may be due to the fact that the latter conquered the Chinese, the former's enemies. Twice a year (at least), at the spring marriage-festival and the autumnal harvest-festival, these people still go out on the hunt for human heads,- those of Chinese generally. The tattooing of the women is more highly developed than that of the men. The women use a simple weaving apparatus. The drawings which the natives made for the author are quite simple and like those of children,-those reproduced are chiefly of men and animals,--and they are, unintentionally, often comical. AMERICA Baelz (H.) Zur frage von der Rassen- Verwandschaft zwischen Mongolen und Indianern. (Verh. d. Berl. Ges. f. Anthr., 1901, 393-394.) Dr Baelz, who has recently been in British Co- lumbia, reports as having found on two Indian children (a pure blood two years old and a half-breed eleven months) the " blue spots," but not so clearly marked as in Mongolian children. The author suggests that since the " Alpine race" (Celtic) of Europe has been suspected</page><page sequence="36">344 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N.

Discussion of the results of an inquiry among 1200oo ne- gro children as to their desires for wealth and their reasons for them. The author concludes that " the negro's real menace to the South consists in the pau- city of his earthly wants." To the negro children " wealth means only the satisfaction of the simplest and most legitimate wants." Field work of the ethnological division of the American Museum of Natural History in 1901oI. (Science, N. Y., 1902, N. s., xv, 96-98.) Brief notes of the work of Swanton (Queen Charlotte Is.), Jochelson and Bogoras (northeast- ern Asia), the work of various other in- vestigators represented in the various publications of the Museum, a list of which for the past year is given,- par- ticularly in the northwestern U.

Dis- cusses, with 5 text-figures, the hiero- glyphic signs for "north" among the Aztecs and the Mayas, particularly the Aztec day-sign ozomatli and the Maya chuen, the Maya God C., etc. The conventional sign for ozomatil has arisen from a monkey head, representing the " Little Bear" constellation. Fuhse (F.) Amerikanische Museen. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1901, LXXX, 313- 314.) Brief notes based on Dr A. B. Meyer's recent Report on the museums of eastern United States. Guevara (T.) Historia de la civilizacion de Araucania. (An. de la Univ., San- tiago de Chile, IgoI, 377-427.) Treats of the social condition of the south at the end of the eighteenth century, with a map showing the distribution of the principal tribes in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Notes on the chroniclers of the Araucanian wars, who are quite numerous, are included. Also an account of the missionary la- bors of the Jesuits, Franciscans, etc. The Indians seemed to have believed that baptism caused the death of their children, and many other beliefs and obstacles made the missions ineffective during this period, and even till the present day, though, from the account of the prefect of the Castro missions in 1897, the Indian opposition is weaken- ing. At Cholchol and Maquehua Pro- testant missions have been at work since 1897 with some success. Hallock (C.) The ancestors of the American indigenes. (Amer. Antiq., Chicago, 1902, XXIV, 2-18.) The au- thor argues in favor of a high anti- quity of ancient American civilization and its close relations with the peoples of Egypt and Asia. Among other things, he believes that " the progeni- tors of the ancestors of the Mexicans were an Asiatic colony from Corea," that " the sun-dance of the plains In- dians is a relic of the sun worship of Chichen-Itza and Peru," etc. Hartman (C. V.) Etnografiska under- sakningar afver aztekerna i Salvador. (Ymer, Stockholm, 19oi, XXI, 277- 324.) This account of ethnographical researches among the Aztecs (Pipils, etc.) of the Republic of Salvador in Central America, is illustrated with 30 figures. People, houses and furniture, implements, industries, playthings of children, religious ceremonies, dances, and masks are treated of. The Aztecs of western Salvador number some Ioo,ooo. The seats figured on page 3o0 resemble some reported from Brazil by von den Steinen. A top from Na- huizalco seems identical with one from Ancon (Peru). Basketry, which is considered in some detail (pp. 303- 311), is a chief industry of these peo- ple. Four principal kinds of reed- baskets are made. Pages 314-322 are concerned with religious ceremonies, dances, and masks (a number of these are figured on pages 319 and 320). Nominally Catholics, the Aztecs of Salvador retain something of the old heathenisrix. The dramatic dance still survives among them, and other old heathen customs have attached them- selves to the church processions, etc. Lasch (R.) Die Versttimmlung der Ziahne in Amerika und Bemerkungen zur Zahndeformierung im Allgemeinen, (Mitth. d. anthrop. Ges. in Wien, IgoI,</page><page sequence="37">PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 345 Lasch- Continued. xxxI, 13-22.) Discusses, with numer- ous bibliographical references, the prac- tice of deforming the teeth (knocking out, filing, coloring) among the Ameri- can aborigines, in relation to the gen- eral subject. Dr Lasch concludes that knocking out teeth, filing teeth, and coloring teeth are all at bottom cos- metic practices, intended to attract the other sex. Vanity, not superstition, as so many have supposed, is the primitive stimulus here, as with other bodily mutilations, etc. Of course connection of teeth-deformation with rites and ceremonies is not excluded, but these (the puberty-practice, e. g.) come later. It is easy to see how coloring the teeth may be cosmetic in origin, but some of the other customs are not so readily explained. Macclintock (S. S.) The Kentucky mountains and their feuds. (Amer. J. Sociol., Chicago, 1901, VII, 1-28, 171- 187.) Illustrated general account. En- vironment, food, houses, religion, cloth- ing, marriage, language (it has "a Chaucerian smack"), feuds, etc., are briefly discussed. MacCurdy (G. G.) The American As- sociation for the Advancement of Science. Section H. Anthropology. (Science, N. Y., 1902, N. S., XV, 121- 126.) Brief abstracts of papers read at the Chicago Meeting, Dec. 31, 1901, to Jan. 2, 1902. - The teaching of anthropology in the United States. (Ibid., 211-216.) From investigations made by the author it appears that ' of the 31 universities and colleges offering anthropology, it is found to be an adjunct of sociology in 9, of philosophy in 5, of psychology in 3, of geology and zoology in 5, and of medicine in I; while in 5 instances it stands practically alone, and in 3 it is unclassed." The reports of the vari- ous instructors are given. Dr Mac- Curdy sees reason to believe that an- thropology will soon find a place in every institution of higher learning in the country. - Twenty years of Section H., Anthropology. (Ibid., 532-534.) Sta- tistics, according to geography of sub- jects treated, of the papers read at the meetings of the Anthropological Section of the A. A. A. S. x882-1901, com- pared with the papers of the British Association (Section H) 1893-1896, French Association 1893-1896, German Anthropological Society, 1897-1900oo. The great preponderance in the Ameri- can Association of papers treating American subjects only is noted, also the domination of archeological topics, with ethnological next. Out of atotal of 589 papers read during the period 1887- 19Ol only 5.4% were devoted solely to foreign lands. Mason (0. T.) Environment in relation to sex in human culture. (Pop. Sci. Mo., N. Y., 1902, LX, 336-345.) After a brief discussion of the animal, vegetal, and mineral kingdoms and the forces of nature in relation to social and tech- nical activities of the sexes, Professor Mason takes up in succession the vari- ous culture-areas of the New World: The birch-bark area (better for men than women), north Atlantic area (cul- tivation of maize by women and its results), Mississippi valley area (buffalo and prairie cultures), Muskhogean area (a bi-sexual province), south Atlantic area (two sexes equally non-progressive, but well-fed), north Pacific area (canoe- culture province), Oregon-California area (woman the basket-maker), the Pueblo area (feminal life higher than the virile-religion and art largely fem- inal), Mexican area (art-forms, etc., virile), Colombian area (women farmers, potters, weavers), Peruvian area (the zenith of virile Amerindian art). Peet (S. D.) Ethnic styles in architec- ture. (Amer. Antiq., Chicago, 1902, xxIV, 19-34, 61-76.) Illustrated gen- eral discussion of different styles of architecture in use among the Amerinds. of North America,-the Muskhogees, Pueblos, Mexicans, Mayas in partic- ular. Preuss (T.) Parallelen zwischen den alten Mexikanern und den heutigen Huicholindianern. (Globus, Brnschwg., 19I01, LXXX, 314-315.)

Anthr., 1901, 266.) According to Dr Seler the two hieroglyphic paintings recently published by Chavero,-the Mapa de Tlaxcallan and the Cddice ciclogrdftco,--are fabrications by a clever young artist of Tabasco, who also</page><page sequence="38">346 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 4, 1902 Seler- Continued. palmed off one of his Mss. on the Duc de Loubat, and whose hand is also to be seen in the Relieves de Chiapas, pub- lished by the Mexican Junta Colom- bina. These fabrications are made up from figures in Kingsborough and in various Mexican and Maya Mss., the mixture often exhibiting crass igno- rance of Central American paleography. Slocum (C. E.) A plea for greater simplicity, and greater accuracy, in the writings of the future regarding the American aborigines. (Amer. Antiq., Chicago, g192, XXIV, 46-48.) The au- thor argues in favor of the designation "aborigines" as both appropriate and expressive. " Indian," " American Race," "Red Race," and "Amerind " he objects to. The last expression he thinks " the most inexcusable of all, and likely to be confined to a few persons of the present generation." When he stigmatizes " Amerind" as a " bastard " term, Dr Slocum ought to have remem- bered how the once denounced "bas- tard" term sociology has found an abiding place in civilized tongues in the Old World and in the New. Denuncia- tions of this sort will help on, rather than hinder, the use of Amerind. von den Steinen (K.) Eine anthro- pomorphe Todten-Urne von Maraca. (Verh. d. Berl. Ges. f. Anthr., 19o0, 387-389.) Describes, with plate, a funeral urn from the caves of Maraca in the Amazonian region of Brazil, now in the Museum fiir V61lkerkunde in Berlin,-another is in the Ethnographic Museum of Christiania, and both re- semble urns figured by Hartt, which were found at Maraca by Penna in 1872. The covers of the urns make the faces. The Berlin urn is skeletal in some points, aswell asanthropomorphic. Dr von den Steinen notes how seldom in America the cover of a vessel has been given independent form. - Ueber die Guayaqui-Sammlung des Hrn. Dr. v. Weickhmann. (Ibid., 267-271.) Brief account of a collection of Guayaqui ethnological material (weapons, implements, orna- ments, etc.) left behind in 1899 by a group of Guayaquf Indians of Paraguay in their flight from the white investiga- tor and his companions. This collec- tion is now in the Berlin Museum fftr V6lkerkunde. Very interesting is the use the Guayaquf make of wax in smear- ing their baskets for use as water-vessels and for improving the poor clay of which their pottery is made. The paper includes two brief vocabularies obtained from a boy who was aban- doned by his people on their sudden departure. The presence of a consider- able number of words coinciding with corresponding Guarani terms seems to indicate that the Guayaqui may after all belong to the Guarani linguistic stock. Uhle (M.) Die deformirten K6pfe von peruanischen Mumien und die Uta- Krankheit. (Ibid., 404-409.) The Uta disease seems to be of a venereal sort. The author argues that Peruvian skull-deformation has been largely intentional, citing from Spanish ecclesi- astical and historical documents in proof of this view. Local and tribal differences in the matter of deformation seem to have prevailed (e. g., the Caba- nas preferred a long, the Collaguas a broad, head). Among the Collaguas the head of infants was deformed to make the cap fit well. In the discus- sion, Professor Rudolf Virchow reiter- ated his opinion that the deformation of Peruvian skulls was intentional. Virchow (R.) Die beiden Azteken. (Ibid., 348-350.) Brief notes, with 2 figures from photographs of naked bodies, of the two microcephalic individ- uals Bartola and Maximo, known as " Aztecs." Dr Virchow notes the re- semblance of their features to those on ancient Central America pottery and clay-images. The woman is much better developed physically than the man, and his legs and arms are much longer. Both are in good health. Their intellectual development can hardly be said to have made any progress in the last 35 years. Their feelings are given only feeble expression; deep emotions are foreign to them ; their laughter has a mechanical character. - Ueber den ausgeweideten Kopf eines Jivaro. (Ibid., 265.) Brief note on the dried head of a Jivaro Indian from the sources of the Amazon, on exhibition before the Society. Also reference to another head of a Guambia Indian belonging to Dr Virchow.

Hafted knives, etc., from ancient Mexico, the Ohio mounds, the cliff-houses of the southwest, are briefly described. The cliff-house double-bladed knife, figured on page 4, is said to resemble a similar object "shown in the hand of a god issuing from the mouth of a serpent sculptured upon one of the lintels of a temple at Yaxchilan, southern Mexico."</page></plain_text>
