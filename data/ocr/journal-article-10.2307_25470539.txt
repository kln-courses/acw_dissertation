<plain_text><page sequence="1">HIERARCHY, COMMUNALISM, AND THE SPATIAL ORDER OF NORTHWEST COAST PLANK HOUSES: A COMPARATIVE STUDY Gary Coupland, Terence Clark, and Amanda Palmer The tension between hierarchy and communalism is a prominent feature of social life in transegalitarian societies. How are hierarchy and communalism combined in these societies? How are they materialized in everyday life? In this paper, we examine the relationship between hierarchy and communalism in the transegalitarian societies of the Northwest Coast of North America. We focus on households, the primary socioeconomic units of the culture area, and on the plank houses that contained them. Despite the apparent contradiction between hierarchy and communalism, we find that in Northwest Coast households with highly developed social hierarchies, communal practices remained deeply entrenched, while in households with weaker hierarchies, communalism was less developed. The relative importance of hierarchy and communalism in daily household life was clearly materialized in the spatial order of plank houses. By simultaneously objectifying both principles, the house may have played an important role in easing the tension between them. La tension entre jerarquia y comunalismo es un rasgo prominente en la vida social de las sociedades trans-igualitarias. i Como se combina la jerarquia y el comunalismo en estas sociedades? iComo se materializan en la vida cotidiana? En este trabajo, examinamos la relacion entre jerarquia y comunalismo dentro de las sociedades trans-igualitarias de la costa noroeste de Norte America. Nosfocalizamos en las tenencias familiares, en tanto unidades socio-economicas primarias de la cultura local, y en las estructuras residenciales que las contenian. Aun cuando existe una aparente contradiccion entre jerarquia y comu nalismo, encontramos que en la costa noroeste, donde existen tenencias familiares con jerarquias sociales altamente desar rolladas, las prdcticas comunales se mantuvieron profundamente establecidas, mientras que en tenencias familiares con jerarquias mas debiles, el comunalismo fue menos desarrollado. La importancia relativa de jerarquia y comunalismo en la vida cotidiana de las tenencias familiares se materializaba claramente en el orden espacial de las estructuras residenciales. Al objetivizar simultaneamente estos principios, la estructura residencial habria jugado un rol importante regulando la ten sion entre ambos. In fact, it could be argued that the contradic tion between communal forms and emerging hierarchy has provided much of the energy for the social dynamic during long periods of human history... prior to the development of classes [Richard Lee 1990:230]. Between bands and states there exists, and has long existed, a large and diverse group of human societies that have been labeled by various terms, perhaps the most encompassing of which is "transegalitarian" (Clark and Blake 1994; Hayden 1995; Sassaman 2004). The defin ing feature of transegalitarian societies is that they are neither egalitarian in their social relations, nor fully stratified. Understood by many to be inter mediate or even transitional between societies ordered by kinship and those ordered by class, transegalitarian societies combine two key, and in many ways contradictory, elements of social structure?hierarchy and communalism?and, as Richard Lee suggests, the tension between the two is never far below the surface. In this paper, we examine evidence for hierar chy and communalism in the transegalitarian soci eties of the Northwest Coast of North America. Our primary analytic units are the household and its material correlate, that iconic feature of the Northwest Coast culture area, the plank house. We focus on multifamily households and the plank houses that contained them because in Northwest Coast societies, as in many transegalitarian soci Gary Coupland, Terence Clark, and Amanda Palmer Department of Anthropology, University of Toronto, 19 Russell Street, Toronto, Ontario M5S 2S2, Canada (coupland@chass.utoronto.ca) (terence.clark@utoronto.ca) (manda.palmer @ utoronto. ca) American Antiquity 74(1), 2009, pp. 77-106 Copyright ?2009 by the Society for American Archaeology 77</page><page sequence="2">78 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 74, No. 1, 2009 eties, the household was the primary domain of social reproductive behavior (Blanton 1995:108). Hierarchy and communalism were contested, nego tiated, and reproduced, first and foremost, within the house. We have two objectives. One is to examine the ways in which hierarchy and communalism were combined in Northwest Coast households. In areas of the coast where household hierarchies were strongly developed, were communal practices muted or did they remain deeply entrenched? Con versely, how strong was household communalism in other areas of the coast where household hier archies were less strongly developed? Our other objective is to investigate the ways in which hier archy and communalism were materialized in the daily lives of Northwest Coast households. How and to what extent were these important "taxo nomic principles" (Bourdieu 1977:89) objectified in the spatial order of plank houses? Did the house itself have a role to play in resolving some of the tension between hierarchy and communalism? Our approach is comparative. We examine regional variation in the practice of hierarchy and communalism by drawing on household evidence from four subareas of the Northwest Coast: the north coast, the Wakashan subarea of the central coast, the Coast Salish subarea of the central coast, and the south coast (Figure 1). First, we review ethnographic evidence for the importance of hier archy and communalism in the structuring of household life in each subarea. Then we turn to the material evidence of plank houses from each sub area, including our own archaeological data from Prince Rupert harbor and the lower Skeena River on the north coast, to examine how the material ization of hierarchy and communalism in houses varies through the region. Hierarchy and Communalism in Transegalitarian Societies Archaeologists studying transegalitarian societies have been primarily interested in the emergence of hierarchy (e.g., Arnold 2000; Hayden 1995). By hierarchy, we refer to a non-egalitarian structure organized into a graded series of ranks, each rank subordinate to those above it. In hierarchical soci eties, goods and services are mobilized upwards through the ranks, resulting in unequal access to wealth, status, and power. The gaining of personal prestige and status may not only be tolerated but cel ebrated in these societies?in the Northwest Coast context Wayne Suttles (1968) has referred to this as "the drive for prestige"?and may lead to intense competition between individuals. Less attention has been paid to the study of communalism in transe galitarian societies (cf., Canuto and Yaeger 2000; Saitta and Keene 1990). By communalism, we mean something very similar to what Lewis Henry Mor gan (1965 [1881]) meant well over a century ago? a local community, larger than the nuclear family, that forms the basic unit of production and con sumption, and that is characterized by cohesiveness and solidarity (see Bohannan 1965:xi).! In com munal formations the goals of the community over ride those of the individual, or as Moemeka (1998:119) puts it, "individuals virtually 'lose the self for the welfare of their community." Labor is cooperative although not always equally shared, and the resources that sustain life are held in com mon. The essential spirit of communalism?"one for all, and all for one"?lives on, to a greater or lesser extent, in transegalitarian societies precisely because they are not fully stratified, because the "old ties of blood" are not completely broken. What is the relationship between hierarchy and communalism in transegalitarian societies? How can the personal "drive for prestige" be reconciled with "losing the self?" One possible answer is sim ply that hierarchy and communalism are, as Richard Lee suggests, so inherently contradictory that they cannot be reconciled. In this schema, a negative relationship exists between hierarchy and communalism such that a gain in one results in a loss in the other. Thus, as hierarchical social orders become more entrenched in transegalitarian soci eties, communalism is eroded. Part of the logic of this view derives from the fact that communalism is a hallmark of so-called egalitarian societies. Indeed, many of our classic anthropological exam ples of communal societies?the IKung, Inuit, Great Basin Shoshone, and Aboriginal peoples of the Australian desert?are avowedly nonhierar chical. But there is a danger in this view of equat ing communalism with egalitarianism. We do not equate the two. As many scholars have noted, com munal relations are not incompatible with social hierarchies (e.g., Moemeka 1998:124; Saitta and Keene 1990:213), and the coexistence of the two</page><page sequence="3">Coupland et al.] NORTHWEST COAST PLANK HOUSES: A COMPARATIVE STUDY 79 C?ast '^BH^^HH^^H south r m^^^M " coast K^MM Figure 1. The Northwest Coast, showing four subareas. has been argued to constitute a key aspect of the political dynamic in societies ranging from small scale (Feinman et al. 2000) to archaic states (Blan ton 1998). We suggest that hierarchy and communalism coexist in transegalitarian societies as alternative strategies that serve the interests of different factions or groups (see Brumfiel 1992). These strategies are constantly being negotiated by these factions in a manner of give and take, so that a gain in hierarchy is not necessarily offset by a loss of communalism. Without a doubt, certain aspects of communal ism are threatened by emerging hierarchy. For example, in many transegalitarian societies all resources may not be held in common by the house hold group. As hierarchy develops, wealth and pres tige items are increasingly controlled by elite indi viduals or families. The division of labor becomes more acute. Elites often eschew common labor, while those of lower status hew wood and haul water. But as our evidence from Northwest Coast households and houses will show, some aspects of communalism are actually strengthened as hierar chy increases. The reason for this, we believe, has to do with the nature of power in transegalitarian societies. Elites in transegalitarian societies are often described as having "power to," but not "power over" (Ames 1995:157; Cobb 1993:51). Their primary goal is to gain prestige, which they often accomplish through public presentations of</page><page sequence="4">80 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 74, No. 1, 2009 food and valuables (Dietler and Hay den 2001; Mauss 1967 [1924]). It is well known that their suc cess hinges on the willingness of their followers (their household in many cases) to support their social ambitions by giving up surpluses. Impor tantly, this support cannot be coerced (Sahlins 1963; Strathern 1984). Elites can exert influence on sub ordinates, encouraging them to work harder and produce more surplus, but they cannot force them to do so. The goals of non-elites are less clear (and less frequently discussed in the literature on transegal itarian societies). For various reasons access to wealth and prestige may be beyond their grasp, leading perhaps to more modest aspirations? economic security, good treatment at the hands of their superiors, or membership in a group of high social standing. But non-elites (at least those who are not enslaved) are not completely powerless. They remain in control of their own labor. If lower status household members feel mistreated or exploited by their superiors, they may withdraw their labor support and not provide their leader with the surplus he needs. In extreme cases, they may abandon their leader altogether. Thus, elites in transegalitarian households walk a fine line, bal ancing the drive for prestige against the need to "take good care" of marginalized members (Drucker 1951:131). Strengthening communalism by fostering solidarity and cohesiveness within the household may become an elite strategy for achiev ing social ambitions. In this view, a positive rela tionship exists between hierarchy and communalism in transegalitarian societies. As households become more hierarchical they become not less communal, but more so. House, Hierarchy and Communalism in Northwest Coast Society: An Overview The basic social and economic unit of virtually all Northwest Coast societies was the multifamily household. The structure and function of Northwest Coast households are aptly described by Levi Strauss' definition of the House2 in his famous con cept of societe a maison, or house societies. Indeed, the Kwakwaka'wakw (Southern Kwakiutl) of the central Northwest Coast was one of Levi-Strauss' main exemplars of house societies. As defined by Levi-Strauss, the House is: a corporate body holding an estate made up of both material and immaterial wealth, which perpetuates itself through the transmission of its names, its goods, and its titles down a real or imaginary line, considered legitimate as long as this continuity can perpetuate itself in the language of kinship or of affinity and, most often, of both [1982:174]. Close to the definition of transegalitarian societies, house societies, Levi-Strauss (1982:186-187) believed, had achieved a certain degree of com plexity in which the communal relations of kinship could no longer adequately organize political and economic life, but class relations were not yet dom inant (see Gillespie 2000:33). Thus, hierarchy and communalism are seen to coexist in Houses in an uneasy relationship, and the house itself is the main arena in which this tension is negotiated on a daily basis through habitus. Hierarchy in Northwest Coast Houses More than a century of scholarship has been devoted to the study of hierarchy in Northwest Coast societies. The list of contributors reads like a "who's who" of North American anthropology? Boas, Swanton, Kroeber, de Laguna, Drucker?and their debates of issues such as "rank versus class" have become part of the anthropological canon. The importance of hierarchy in Northwest Coast societies, characterized by the drive for prestige (Suttles 1968), "the need to make one's name good" (Drucker and Heizer 1967), was institutionalized in class-like social divisions and systems of rank. Most Northwest Coast societies recognized, indeed had names for, three ranked social strata, often referred to by anthropologists as nobles (or title holders), commoners, and slaves (e.g., Boas 1897:338; Donald 1997). Houses commonly com prised members of all three strata. Nobles inherited the titles, privileges, and prop erties that made up the House estate. Inherited titles were of great importance in many (but not all) areas of the coast because they established the rank of individuals within a graded series of titles. The highest ranking titleholder of the house was nor mally descended in the most direct line from the founding ancestor, inherited the name of the House and the largest share of the estate, and was often considered to be the "House chief." Lower-ranking</page><page sequence="5">Coupland et al.] NORTHWEST COAST PLANK HOUSES: A COMPARATIVE STUDY 81 titleholders inherited less. House chiefs directed the labor activities of the household, engaged directly in the production of prestige food resources such as whales and other sea mammals, and per formed ceremonial tasks (Drucker 1951:271). But they rarely participated in the more arduous forms of common labor (Donald 1997:124). Within their communities, nobles were considered to be "well born," had "good blood," and were expected to exercise good judgment and conduct themselves in a proud and dignified manner (Elmendorf 1971:366; Oberg 1973:87). Many Houses had more members than titles, meaning that some members, usually younger sib lings and younger siblings of younger siblings, did not inherit titles. These people were commoners, and throughout the Northwest Coast they were not highly regarded. For example, the Tsimshian term for commoner, wah?d?ayin, means "unhealed per son" (Halpin and Seguin 1990:276). Commoners were expected to "give help to their chief," by pro viding services such as fishing, hunting, and craft ing. Any surplus they produced belonged to their chief. Drucker (1951:272) states that among the Nuu-chah-nulth (Nootka) "people lower in rank always 'helped' a superior; younger brothers gave to their elder sibling whatever they obtained in food or wealth." In this way, goods and services were mobilized to the House chief who, in turn, used the surplus to finance ceremonial events such as feasts and potlatches. At the bottom of the Northwest Coast social order were slaves, who were in every sense chat tel (Ames 2001; Donald 1997). In a comprehen sive study of the practice of slavery on the Northwest Coast, Leland Donald (1997:121-138) has shown that slavery was widespread along the coast, and that slaves were more than just House property. They were put to work by their masters, and their labor contributed to the productive capac ity, and ultimately to the prestige, of their owner. Houses that owned slaves were often able to pro duce greater surpluses and host bigger feasts and potlatches than Houses that did not own slaves. Regional Variation in Household Hierarchies among Northwest Coast Societies The Northwest Coast provides an ideal case for examining the relationship between hierarchy and communalism because of the well known variation in the degree to which hierarchy was developed among Northwest Coast societies. Most Northwest Coast scholars agree that the class-like division of society into nobles, commoners, and slaves, and the formal ranking of nobles according to inherited title were more fully developed and more closely practiced by the societies of the north coast (Tlin git, Haida, Tsimshian, and Haisla) and by the Wakashan societies of the central coast (Heiltsuk, Oowekeeno, Kwakwaka'wakw, and Nuu-chah nulth) than anywhere farther south (Donald 1997; Drucker 1955; Kroeber 1939; Suttles 1960,1987). North coast societies all had matrihneal descent systems. Houses (matrilineages) were ranked rel ative to each other, and individuals within Houses were ranked by title. Nowhere was hierarchy more overtly displayed on the Northwest Coast than at the feasts and potlatches of the north coast soci eties (Rosman and Rubel 1971; Roth 2002). Nobles from different Houses were seated first at these events according to their rank. Indeed, seating orders publicly reaffirmed rank. People of low rank were seated farther back, separated from their House chiefs, and commoners and slaves partici pated only as servants. Moving south, the Wakashan societies of the central coast of British Columbia also had formal Houses?the famous Kwakwaka'wakw numaym was Levi-Strauss' prime exemplar?and strongly developed hierarchical social systems (Boas 1921, 1966; Codere 1950; Drucker 1951; Goldman 1975; Kobrinsky 1975). Positions of leadership in Wakashan societies were closely determined by descent, "that is, by hereditary 'ownership' of pro ductive resources" (Suttles 1987:41). The title sys tem was well developed, and as on the north coast, Houses and individuals were ranked "in an implicit numerical order, the principle of seriation" (Suttles 1987:41). At public events, titleholders were seated according to their rank or "standing place," as Boas called it. Continuing south along the coast, while the "drive for prestige" was important among the Coast Salish societies of the Strait of Georgia and Puget Sound regions, formal systems of social hierarchy were far less developed than farther north (Suttles 1987). According to Donald (1997:275), "the sys tem of titles appears very weakly developed when compared with groups in the northern and central [Wakashan] parts of the culture area," and the term</page><page sequence="6">82 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 74, No. 1, 2009 'titleholder' may not even be apt for some Salish groups. The Twana of southwestern Puget Sound recognized titles, but, unlike the northern and Wakashan societies, did not rank titleholders through formalized seating or other means at rit ual events (Elmendorf 1960:323). At Coast Salish potlatches, House chiefs typically sat with the rest of their household. Elsewhere, the practice of social ranking was virtually absent among the Southern Coast Salish (Suttles and Lane 1990:494). Suttles (1987:41) states that while the northern potlatch functions primarily to "establish and maintain indi vidual and local group rank within the series," the Salish potlatch does not have this function. Along the southern Northwest Coast are several societies whose social structures were, if anything, even less formally hierarchical than the Coast Sal ish. In some societies, such as the Kalapuyans of the Willamette Valley in Oregon and the Atha paskan societies of the southern Oregon coast, rank ing of individuals was virtually absent (Miller and Seaburg 1990:583; Zenk 1990a:550), and corpo rate households were only weakly developed (Zenk 1990a:549; 1990b:559; cf. Tveskov 2007). Acqui sition of prestige and social status were motivating forces along the south coast, but appear to have been based more on personal wealth and achievement than on heredity (Jacobs 1939:88; Olson 1936:95). Drucker (1937:245) states that a Tolowa chief's status "was based on wealth; it was hereditary only in the sense wealth was related." The Chinook of the lower Columbia River are widely regarded as exceptional among southern Northwest Coast soci eties for their emphasis on rank and heredity in the attainment of leadership positions (Ray 1938:49; Silverstein 1990:541). But even among the Chi nook, "movement from the middle group [com moners] to the upper class [nobles] through acquisition of wealth and strength of personality was not uncommon" (Ray 1938:48). In sum, a north-to-south cline in degree of hierarchy is evident along the Northwest Coast, a gradient that many Northwest Coast scholars have long recognized. Among the north coast and Wakashan societies, hierarchy, in the form of the title system and the formalization of social rank ing, was fundamental to the social organization of the House, and was prominently displayed and reinforced at public events. Moving south, the importance of hierarchy steadily diminished, both in terms of household organization and public life. Communalism in Northwest Coast Houses Now, let us look at communalism in Northwest Coast Houses. Throughout the culture area, the House was, as Levi-Strauss defines it, "a corporate body holding an estate" (1982:174). The House chief is often referred to in the ethnographic liter ature as the "owner" of the estate, but technically he only "owned" his share of the estate. The estate was collectively owned by its members (e.g., Col son 1953:191; Olson 1936:92), the very essence of communalism. This meant that "Houses, rather than individuals or families, were the actual sub jects of rights and duties" (Gillespie 2000:25). The Nuu-chah-nulth expression has it that House mem bers "give help to the chief (Drucker 1951:273), but they really worked for their House. By mobi lizing their surpluses to the House chief, they ensured that he could fulfill the ceremonial oblig ations necessary to socially reproduce the House. The concept of collective "ownership" was even extended, perhaps symbolically, to the dwelling itself (Drucker 1951:279). Olson states that among the Quinault, ownership of the house was not so much indi vidual as collective. In a way the head of the household was regarded as "owning" only the end or corner which he occupied, while the oth ers "owned" their sections. The headman could not deprive the others of their shares in the estate [1936:92; emphasis added]. Beyond group control of resources, commu nalism in Northwest Coast Houses was also marked by reciprocal obligations and responsibilities among members that forged cohesiveness and sol idarity. As Donald states, Commoners labored for titleholders within a framework of kinship solidarity and reciproc ity_Titleholders did exploit commoners but not without offering some return; the ethic of reciprocity was real enough, and commoners benefited by belonging to the kin group of a successful titleholder, sharing in his ceremo nial, military or other successes [1997:137; emphasis added]. Other sources indicate that commoners and people</page><page sequence="7">Coupland et al.] NORTHWEST COAST PLANK HOUSES: A COMPARATIVE STUDY 83 of low rank did not only bask vicariously in the reflected glory of their chief. According to Drucker, young Nuu-chah-nulth chiefs were instructed to "take good care of their people, providing them with food and feasts to win their good will and affection, for as one informant told him, "if your people don't like you, you're nothing" (1951:131). And Barnett states that Coast Salish chiefs gave fre quent feasts and entertainments to their households "to maintain their good will" (1955:246). Through out the Northwest Coast, "solidarity feasts" (Per odie 2001:192-194) were given by House chiefs to their households as a way of thanking the mem bers for their work and maintaining their loyalty. Virtually all Northwest Coast households were communal at the most basic level of co-residence. Throughout the culture area, multiple families lived together under one roof. But, as with hierarchy, regional variation existed in the extent to which household communalism was practiced. In some areas households engaged in a wider variety of communal activities and did so more frequently than in other areas. To investigate variation in the extent to which communalism was practiced by Northwest Coast households, we focus on two key factors: (1) stability of membership, and (2) the extent to which the household, as opposed to con stituent families, formed the basic unit of produc tion and consumption. With respect to membership, we argue that household communalism is strength ened where the rules of membership are "restric tive," such that individuals and families have rights of membership in only one House (see Moemeka 1998:124). With little or no opportunity for mobil ity, families live together in the same house all their lives and the sense of communalism among them is therefore likely to be strong. Conversely, house hold communalism is weakened where the rules of membership are "permissive," that is, where indi viduals and families have more than one alterna tive in terms of membership. In such societies, household membership tends to be fluid and chang ing, weakening the bond of communalism. With respect to production and consumption, commu nalism is strengthened when the household pro duces and consumes as a unit and weakened when constituent families produce and consume inde pendently. Throughout the Northwest Coast, house holds were not equally stable in terms of membership, nor did they form the basic unit of production and consumption to the same extent everywhere. Regional Variation in Household Communalism among Northwest Coast Societies North coast Houses had very stable membership (Boas 1916; de Laguna 1972; Garfield 1939; Mur dock 1934; Oberg 1973; Swanton 1905). Unilin eal descent meant that most individuals had rights of membership in only one House. Movement from House to House (and from house to house) by title holders probably occurred rarely if at all, but com moners, who lacked titles, could and did move. Although it is apparent that north coast Houses were very much hierarchically structured, their sta ble membership suggests a high degree of com munalism. And although the evidence is far from conclusive, north coast households appear to have regularly produced and consumed as a unit. With reference to the Chilkat Tlingit, de Laguna (1991:68) states "the women often or usually took turns in feeding the whole [household] group." And in what amounts to a testimony to household com munalism, a Yakutat informant told de Laguna "when you open your winter supply, everybody eats. In 2, 3 days the next woman opens hers" (1972:310). Moving south along the coast, the Wakashan societies had bilateral descent systems, although House leadership tended to be controlled by a patri lateral core group (Boas 1921, 1966; Donald 1997:24; Drucker 1951). Bilateral descent allowed for greater individual mobility than the system on the north coast by permitting alternative member ship in several Houses. This flexibility, mainly afforded to individuals of lower rank and to com moners, prevented Wakashan Houses from becom ing "rigid" in terms of membership (Suttles 1987:41). Drucker states that lower-ranked mem bers and commoners in Nuu-chah-nulth Houses were thought of as "tenants," who: were for the most part perpetual transients. A man might spend a year or two in his mother's house, the next in his wife's father's, then live with his father's mother's group, and later go to live a while with his son-in-law.... One receives the impression that there was a con tinual stream of people pouring in and out of the houses [1951:279].</page><page sequence="8">84 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 74, No. 1, 2009 Indeed, lower-ranked Nuu-chah-nulth and com moners were actually expected to change houses, so that they would not spend all their lives "help ing" only one chief. One informant told Drucker, "If a man stayed too long in one house, his other relatives became jealous. They would think he didn't care for them anymore" (1951:279). High residential mobility meant that Wakashan Houses did not have very stable membership, which must have had a dampening effect on household com munalism. The Coast Salish also had bilateral descent and according to most ethnographic sources families had as much or more freedom to change Houses as their Wakashan neighbors (Barnett 1939,1955; Elmendorf 1960, 1971; Kennedy and Bouchard 1990; Suttles 1987,1990,1991; Suttles and Lane 1990). With neither a highly developed title sys tem nor a strong principle of social ranking, Coast Salish Houses had comparatively little "holding power" over members, even those of high stand ing (Suttles 1991:216). There is also evidence that Coast Salish Houses may have functioned less regularly as the basic, day-to-day unit of produc tion and consumption. Among the Twana, fami lies could access certain resources without working through the House chief or providing the chief with a share of the harvest (Donald 1997:282; Elmendorf 1960:268-270). This sug gests that Twana families may have produced and consumed independently of the household, at least on occasion. Indeed, Coast Salish families appear to have had much more economic autonomy and independence within their houses than families in north coast houses. Central Coast Salish families tended their own fires within the multifamily dwelling, kept their own stores of food, and cooked and ate apart from other families in the house (Suttles 1990:464). Although these fami lies co-operated economically and socially when necessary, "independent family households were more likely to have some autonomy of action" (Donald 1997:24), which ultimately undermined household communalism. Sources for the southern Northwest Coast soci eties are less clear about stability of House mem bership. Suttles (1991:220) states that south coast households may have been less fluid than on the central coast because there was a stronger tendency for men to remain in their fathers' villages after mar riage. But this general preference for patrilocal or virilocal residence was hardly a strict rule. For example, among the Tillamook of the Oregon coast, a newly married couple might live initially with the husband's parents, but "later the couple would con sider their options and choose a residence where they felt most comfortable" (Seaburg and Miller 1990:563). Hajda (1994:185) states that in the lower Columbia region, "a person had usufruct and residential rights in several places, which led to 'structural fluidity' in the area's social organiza tion." With respect to production and consumption, some south coast societies may have lacked house hold communalism altogether. Zenk (1990a:549) states that "there is no evidence that Kalapuyan society had any sort of corporate kin group," while among the Alseans of the southern Oregon coast, he notes (Zenk 1990b:569), "the residence group itself, so far as is known, had no corporate iden tity" (cf. Tveskov 2007). In sum, a north-to-south cline in degree of household communalism is evident along the Northwest Coast, both in terms of stability of House membership and the extent to which the household formed the basic unit of production and consump tion. In the north, Houses were highly stable and cohesive communal groups that routinely produced and consumed as a unit. Farther south, Houses were less stable and families had greater freedom of mobility and greater autonomy of action (Donald 1997:24). Indeed, the organization of Coast Salish and south coast Houses, and to a lesser extent Wakashan Houses, may have been based more on principles of collectivism than communalism. Under collectivism individuals and families may live and work together, but they do not "lose the self for the welfare of the community. Families living collectively are essentially self-interested and realize that participation in a multifamily col lective is the best way to achieve their goals (Moe meka 1998:124). This is similar to Blanton's notion of "incorporative households," wherein households are characterized by "a congruence of individual member interests" (Blanton 1995:109). In the col lectivist or incorporative strategy, individuals and families consider a number of alternative household memberships and choose to live where they per ceive their interests will be best served. In incor porative households, the spirit of communalism is much diminished.</page><page sequence="9">Coupland et al.] NORTHWEST COAST PLANK HOUSES: A COMPARATIVE STUDY 85 Paralleling the cline in household communal ism is the cline in household hierarchy. Both are most strongly developed among the societies of the north coast, and weakest in the south. The Wakashan societies of the central Northwest Coast appear to be transitional, a position that has been attributed to them by other scholars (Kroeber 1939; Suttles 1991), evincing a high degree of household hierarchy, but a lower degree of household com munalism. The Northwest Coast evidence sug gests a positive relationship between hierarchy and communalism within Houses. Where hierarchy is most highly developed, it is balanced by a strong sense of household communalism. And where hierarchy is less formalized, household commu nalism is weaker and begins to give way to fam ily independence. Hierarchy and the Spatial Order of Northwest Coast Houses We now turn to the material evidence of hierarchy and communalism in Northwest Coast plank houses. As many scholars have observed, houses are vehicles through which social structure and other important cultural categories are material ized and reinforced (Ames 2006; Blanton 1994; Blier 1987; Bourdieu 1977; Carsten and Hugh Jones, ed. 1995; Cunningham 1973; Donley-Reid 1990; Gillespie 2000; Hodder 1990; Pearson and Richards 1994; Rapoport 1969,1990[1982]). Par ticularly in nonliterate societies, the house is seen by many to be the primary locus or "structuration locale" (Giddens 1979, 1984) for the objectifica tion of these principles. Through the spatial order ing of houses and through repetitive daily practices in ordered household spaces, taxonomic principles, such as hierarchy and communalism, become ingrained in habitus. Houses are, thus, "structur ing structures" (Bourdieu 1977:90) that continu ously inculcate and reinforce these principles to their occupants. In this section, we ask how, and to what extent, was hierarchy materialized in the spatial order of plank houses. Taking each subarea of the North west Coast in turn, we look first at the rich ethno graphic record of plank houses, and then turn to the archaeological evidence. In the next section of the paper we will look at the ways in which plank houses materialized communalism. One way in which hierarchy is materialized in houses is through the allocation of family sleeping spaces (Blanton 1995:115; Cunningham 1973:232). In societies where household hierarchies are highly developed we might expect a strong rule allocating family sleeping spaces within the house according to rank. Such an arrangement would constantly remind household members of the importance of hierarchy, an example of what Blanton (1994:9) calls "canonical communication" by the house. Where household hierarchies are more weakly developed we would expect a more random arrange ment of family sleeping spaces. Having argued that household hierarchies were most highly developed among the societies of the north coast, we begin by looking at plank houses from that region. North Coast Houses At the time of European contact in the late eigh teenth century, north coast plank houses were gable-roofed structures, square to rectangular in shape, and normally large enough to accommodate several families (Suttles 1990, 1991). Wealthy, high-ranking Houses often built houses in which the open, central floor area was excavated, some times quite deeply, below ground surface. Such houses were called da-ak's by the Tsimshian and da's by the Haida. In some houses, these square, steep-sided pits were stepped down in tiers, with retaining walls at each level. A Tsimshian house with an unusually deep, multi-tiered da-ak was known as "Ten Levels Down" (Miller 1997:46). Family sleeping spaces in all houses were located around the perimeter of the house, often on a raised bench or platform, and these spaces were invari ably allocated according to a gradient of social rank (Figure 2). In her classic ethnography of the Yakutat Tlin git, Frederica de Laguna provides one of the most thorough descriptions of traditional houses, com plete with floor plans, from anywhere on the North west Coast. She states, The position of the sleeping quarters of these individuals and their families reflected their social standing within the hierarchy of the household-the rear of the house (deyi) was the place of honor, where the house chief had his quarters and where he seated visiting chiefs at feasts, while the front of the house was for those of little or no account [1972:294].</page><page sequence="10">86 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 74, No. 1, 2009 I I II I j House j _ 1 t Nobles j Chief I Nobles T Central T Lesser Fl Lesser Nobles c Nobles Space Commoners and Slaves I I i ?M Figure 2. Schematic floor plan of a north coast house, showing arrangement of family sleeping areas by rank. One of de Laguna's informants told her that slaves always slept by the door of the house: "I never heard of letting them sleep in the main part of the house.... The name [xafaq ku'w.a. Tlingit term for slave] means 'the people that live on the door side'" (de Laguna 1972:297). Here we see an entire class of people referred to by their designated space in the house. Other ethnographic accounts of Tlingit houses also describe the descending gradient of social rank within the house from back to front (Emmons 1991:62 [1916]; Oberg 1973:31). Family spaces in Tsimshian houses (Garfield 1951:11; Halpin and Seguin 1990:271; Miller 1997:46-47) and Haida houses (Blackman 1972, 1990:243; MacDonald 1983:21) were similarly arranged. In da-ak's and da's, there was also a vertical dimension to rank, with House chief and high-ranking nobles on the upper level and lower status families on the lower levels (Blackman 1981:127-131). Ethnographic accounts of the allocation of family space in north coast houses are remarkably consistent. Invariably, rank descended from the back of the house to the front and from upper levels to lower levels in such a way that the hierarchical social order of the house hold and the spatial order of the house were per fectly congruent. Archaeological evidence of the materialization of hierarchy in north coast houses, although not as rich as the ethnographic data, provides supporting evidence, and also hints at possible changes in the organization of house space through time. In one of the earliest examples of "household archaeol ogy" on the Northwest Coast, Knut Fladmark (1973) excavated portions of a remarkably large (26 X 18 m) early nineteenth-century house feature at the Richardson Ranch site on Graham Island in Haida Gwaii (Queen Charlotte Islands; Figure 3). Excavations revealed an interior plan and distrib ution of materials that are entirely consistent with the ethnographic model of hierarchy in north coast houses. Euro-Canadian trade goods, shell beads, copper, and other items of wealth were concen trated in the rear of the house. Remains of sea otter (Enhydra lutris), the primary commodity of the maritime fur trade, also occurred more frequently in the rear of the house, suggesting that the occu pants of this part of the house controlled this impor tant trade resource (Fladmark 1973:73-74). In contrast, fire-cracked rock and other cooking debris associated with mundane domestic activities were concentrated in the front of the house. Items of wealth and personal adornment were also concentrated in the rear of excavated house fea tures at Quai'dju, Xe-uda'o, and Tciu'uga, three Kunghit Haida villages at the southern end of Haida Gwaii (Acheson 1991:138; 1998). All three vil lages were established before European contact. Quai'dju and Xe-uda'o were abandoned in the first few decades of the maritime fur trade, about A.D. 1800. Tc lu'uga lacks fur trade goods, and is thought to have been abandoned about 200 years before contact (Acheson 1991:121). Excavations at the McNichol Creek site in Prince Rupert harbor provide pre-European con tact evidence of household organization for the period 2000-1500 B.P. (Coupland 2006; Coupland et al. 1993; Coupland et al. 2003). McNichol Creek is one of many village sites in Prince Rupert har bor with house depression features visible on the ground surface (Archer 2001). Fifteen such features were arranged in two rows facing the beach at McNichol Creek. Portions of five house features were excavated. Of interest with respect to house hold hierarchy are the results from House O in the middle of the front row, the position traditionally reserved for the house of the highest-ranking chief in the village (MacDonald 1983; Miller 1997).

North coast tribal areas, villages, and archaeological sites mentioned in the text. ering an area of about 100 m2, House O was by far the largest house feature at the site (other houses ranged from about 40-75 m2). Items and features of wealth and high status, including several pieces of polished nephrite, obsidian flakes, a polished stone labret, and a prepared clay floor, were all recovered from the rear area of House O. Excava tions in the front area of the house yielded high den sities of fire-cracked rock and other food preparation debris. Three radiocarbon dates, all on charcoal recovered from a large hearth in the cen ter of the house floor, overlap in the one-sigma range between 1650 and 1610 B.P. (Coupland et al. 2003:154). Based on its size and prominent placement in the front row, we suggest that House O was a high-status house, a "chief's house" (Cou pland 2006). The distribution of material remains suggests that organization of space within this house according to hierarchical principles similar to those of the contact period is at least 1,600 years old at Prince Rupert harbor. Interestingly, the House O spatial pattern was not duplicated in the other four, smaller house fea tures (Houses D, E, K, and N) excavated at McNi chol Creek. These houses yielded fewer items of wealth and high status than House O, and those few items that were recovered were not concentrated in the rear areas of the house features. We suggest two possible reasons for the differences between House O and the other, smaller houses. One is that hier archical social systems may have been only in the early stages of development at this time on the north coast (Maschner 1991) and the spatial order of houses was in transition with only a few houses beginning to materialize hierarchy. In other words, household hierarchies may have existed but were not clearly materialized in the small houses at McNichol Creek. Another possibility is that less hierarchical social relations prevailed in the smaller houses at McNichol Creek. These houses may have been of lower status than House O and not orga nized by the same principles of hierarchy. Indeed, even the ethnographic record is largely mute on the spatial order of low-status houses. Finally, evidence of early household organiza tion on the north coast comes from the Paul Mason</page><page sequence="12">88 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 74, No. 1, 2009 site at Kitselas Canyon on the Skeena River, 150 km inland from the coast (Coupland 1985, 1988). This small village site of ten house features arranged in two rows has been dated to about 3200 B.R, making it one of the oldest dated village sites anywhere on the Northwest Coast. Two house fea tures were excavated, one from each row. All ten Paul Mason site house features were similar in size and shape to the smaller McNichol Creek houses.3 On the basis of this relative uniformity in house size, and given the general absence of wealth items and status symbols from excavated contexts, social rela tions within and among houses at the Paul Mason site are thought to have been egalitarian (Coupland 1985). Much later, egalitarian relations may have continued to exist within the smaller McNichol Creek households, but not within House O. House O is the only excavated north coast house from this period (3200-1600 B.P.) that materializes hierar chy in a way that conforms to the ethnographic evi dence (concentration of wealth and prestige items in the rear of the house). Wakashan Houses Moving south, Wakashan houses were large, rec tangular, gable-roofed structures, superficially sim ilar in design to north coast houses, but with some important differences. The gable roofs were much lower, the long axes of the houses typically ran par allel to the shoreline rather than perpendicular to it, and wall planks were slung between paired house posts. Unlike their northern neighbors, Wakashan groups never built houses with dug out floors (Drucker 1951:71; Suttles 1991:220). Suttles (1991) concludes that Wakashan houses were built in such a way that they could be readily enlarged or reduced in size to accommodate changes in household size resulting from the steady move ment of people into and out of houses. Family sleeping spaces in Nuu-chah-nulth houses were arranged according to rank, in a sys tem that Drucker (1951:71) describes as "invari able" (Arima and Dewhirst 1990:399; Jewitt 1967:63 [1815]; Sproat 1987:42 [1868]). The place of highest rank, belonging to the house chief, was the right rear corner of the house, and was given the name hiisa 'al. The noble next in rank occu pied the left rear corner, a place referred to as hiisokwas. The front corners of the house, to the right and left of the door, were places of lesser House | Second Ranking Chief | Noble Commoners Central Commoners and Slaves Floor and Slaves Space Lesser I-1 Lesser Nobles | Commoners j Nobles | and Slaves j I =3 I ' J Figure 4. Schematic floor plan of a Wakashan house, show ing arrangement of family sleeping areas by rank. honor, and if the House had more than four title holders, the central spaces along each side wall were used (Figure 4). According to Drucker, these four (sometimes six) spaces were considered to be "owned" by their occupants who, because of their high rank, "did not move about from one house group to another nearly as much as did the other people" (1951:71). People of low rank, common ers and slaves apparently slept wherever they could find space in the house. We could find little information on the arrange ment of family sleeping spaces in Kwak waka'wakw, Heiltsuk, and Oowekeeno houses. Both Boas (1889:200) andCodere (1990:365) state that the houses of these groups were typically occu pied by four families, one in each corner of the house. They do not state whether the families occu pied specific corners according to their rank, as in Nuu-chah-nulth houses. Archaeological evidence of hierarchy in Wakashan houses comes from Ozette, the famous late pre-contact Makah (southern Nuu-chah-nulth) village on the outer Washington coast (Figure 5). Of particular interest are the remains from House 1 (400-200 B.R), the largest (20.5 X 12 m) and richest in terms of recovered items of wealth and high social status of the three house features exca vated at the site (Huelsbeck 1989; Mauger 1978; Samuels 1989, 2006). The distribution of wealth and status items within House 1 conforms closely to the Wakashan ethnographic model. The rear right corner of House 1 (northeast corner) yielded the highest density of status items, including dentalia</page><page sequence="13">Coupland et al.] NORTHWEST COAST PLANK HOUSES: A COMPARATIVE STUDY 89 MaAw^^^P^atufup^HHHH| Figure 5. Central coast tribal areas, villages, and archaeological sites mentioned in the text. shell beads and a wooden bench inlaid with red tur ban opercula (Huelsbeck 1989:160; Samuels 1989:153). The rear left (southeast) corner yielded the next highest density of wealth and status items (Huelsbeck 1989:160-161). Items of wealth and status were much less abundant in Houses 2 and 5, the other excavated houses at Ozette (Huelsbeck 1989). Coast Salish Houses The architecture of Coast Salish houses was dif ferent from Wakashan houses in that the Coast Sal ish used the single pitched or "shed roof design (Boas 1891; Matson 2003; Suttles 1991). But the result was the same. This flexible design allowed the Coast Salish to rather easily add or remove sec tions from either end of the house to accommodate the movement of people (Suttles 1991). Some Coast Salish houses were enormously large. Old Man House, for example, built in the early nine teenth century on Agate Pass in Puget Sound, was almost 160 m long and 18 m wide (Gibbs 1970 [1877]; Snyder 1956; Suttles 1991:212). A Sto:lo house on the lower Fraser River was even longer, at almost 200 m, when measured by Simon Fraser in 1808 (Lamb 1960:103). Both structures were actually a series of multifamily houses laid end to end in row-house style, all under one roof. Most Coast Salish houses were much shorter than this, but average-sized houses were still large enough to accommodate several families, "two, four, six, or more," according to Suttles (1991:215). Suttles (1991) provides a thorough description of the inte riors of Central Coast Salish houses, including the sizes and arrangement of family spaces. He notes that House leaders or chiefs were wealthy men whose "families occupied more space in the house than other families" (1991:216; also Vastokas 1966:109). Hill-Tout (1901:486, 1902:360, 1906:233) believed that family spaces in Coast Sal ish houses were allocated according to status, with the House chief in the center and rank descending on either side of him, but Suttles (1991:221) dis putes this description, stating that no other Coast Salish ethnographer has reported such an arrange ment. In comparing allocation of family spaces in Coast Salish houses to that of north coast and Wakashan houses, Suttles (1991:219) states, "most</page><page sequence="14">90 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 74, No. 1, 2009 Coast Salish, I believe, would have rejected such explicit indication of rank." Turning to the archaeological evidence of plank houses in the Coast Salish area, Chatters (1989:173) found evidence of economic specialization within a large house (27 X 9 m) dated to the early contact period at Sbabadid, in southern Puget Sound, but spatial evidence for household hierarchy is ambigu ous. Chatters divides the house into five family areas based on placement of hearths and house posts (1989:173), but there is no indication that these family spaces were ordered by rank. The fam ily in Area 2, he suggests, were sea mammal hunt ing specialists, ahigh-status activity. But Area 2 was the smallest family space in the house, and did not contain other obvious signs of wealth. For exam ple, copper, a valued trade good, was more com mon in Area 3 (Chatters 1989:174). It does not appear that hierarchy was materialized in the spa tial order of the house at Sbabadid. Evidence relating to the materialization of hier archy from an earlier time period in the Coast Sal ish region, 1900-1500 B.R, comes from Tualdad Ami in southern Puget Sound and from Dionisio Point and Shingle Point in the Gulf of Georgia, southwestern British Columbia. At Tualdad Altu, dated to about 1600 B.R, Chatters (1988,1989:174) found evidence of economic differentiation between the occupants of the west and east ends of the 17 X 7 m house (similar to Sbabadid), but it does not appear, nor does Chatters suggest, that one or the other groups was wealthier or of higher sta tus. In House 2 (20 X 10 m) at Dionisio Point, dated 1700-1500 B.R, a large cache of stone disk beads, two labrets, and an anthropomorphic stone bowl, all high-status items, were found in the central area of the house, which Grier interprets as belonging to the House chief (Grier 2001:123, 2006:108 109). Another stone bowl was found in the south west corner of the house. The east side of the house yielded no status or wealth items, only items related to production and manufacture. This spatial pattern, which Grier (2006:114) argues may have remained stable throughout the 200 year-long occupation of the house, clearly distinguishes the central area as high status. The house at Shingle Point, dated to about 1900 B.P, was divided into two family areas, each measuring about 50 m2 (Matson 2003:95). Remains of sea urchin, a highly valued food resource, and an otherwise cleanly swept floor in the north end of the house, led Matson (2003:92, 100) to tentatively suggest that the family(s) occu pying this space may have been of higher status than those in the south end. While the evidence at hand is far from conclusive, it does appear that hierar chy was materialized in the spatial order of House 2 at Dionisio Point and possibly at Shingle Point. Thus patterns of household organization and mate rial expressions of hierarchy may have changed within the region during the last 1900 to 1600 years. Even older house features in the Coast Salish region, dated 2500-2000 B.P, have been excavated at Scowlitz on the lower Fraser River (Lepofsky et al. 2000), Crescent Beach near the mouth of the Fraser River (Matson 1992), 45CA426 near Sequim, Washington (Morgan 1999), and45SJ169 on Decatur Island, Washington (Walker 2003). The Scowlitz house measured 11 X 7 m and probably held more than one family, but the structures at the other sites were small (less than 25 m2), possibly seasonal, single-family dwellings. None of these houses provide evidence of hierarchical organiza tion of space. The oldest excavated house features in the Coast Salish region, indeed from anywhere on the North west Coast, are at the Maurer site (LeClair 1976; Schaepe 2003) and at Xay:tem (Mason 1994), both near the lower Fraser River. The Maurer house has been dated to 4200 B.R, and Xay:tem to 4700 B.P. Both houses were large enough (Maurer, 11X8 m; Xay:tem, 11 X 10 m) to have held more than one family, but neither shows spatial evidence of hierarchical organization. South Coast Houses The houses of southern Northwest Coast groups were rectangular gable-roofed structures, with floors often excavated below ground level (Hajda 1984; Suttles 1991). In most areas, houses con tained from two to six families, four being most common (Boas 1923:3; Hajda 1994; Jacobs 2003; Ray 1938:124). Chinook houses of the Greater Lower Columbia River Region (GLCRR) varied greatly in size, with some, most notably in the Wap ato Valley, reaching lengths of more than 100 m (Hajda 1984:77-79, 1994). These long structures were often divided into a series of multifamily com partments, not unlike Old Man House and other long Coast Salish structures. In the long Chinook houses described by Lewis and Clark in the early</page><page sequence="15">Coupland et al.] NORTHWEST COAST PLANK HOUSES: A COMPARATIVE STUDY 91 Palmrose ^^^^^^H^^^^^Efl^^B^^^^^HI^^^S Nehalem Bay ^^^^^^H^^^H^^^9^^^^^8^^^^^| Netarts Sandspit^^^^^^^^^^H&amp;ngjf^^^^^^^^^^^^^H Figure 6. South coast tribal areas, villages, and archaeological sites mentioned in the text. nineteenth century, the compartments measured about 10 X 10 m and were separated by narrow passageways (Moulton 1990:84, 218-222, 1991:97,107). The entrances to the compartments were via the passageways, and a single, continu ous roof covered the entire structure (also Franchere 1966:328 [1854]; Parker 1967:167 [1838]; Ross 1966:98 [1849]; Swan 1857:111). Compartments of this size may have housed about four families, which constituted the household. According to Verne Ray (1938:127), the House chief and his family claimed the preferred section of the house as their living space while slaves were grouped in "less desirable" areas, but from one house to the next there seems to have been no systematic rule as to which corner or wall was "preferred" and which areas were less desirable. Other family spaces in the house were not arranged by status or rank (Ray 1938:127) (Figure 6). For the Tillamook of the Oregon coast, four family houses were common, but Jacobs (2003:97) makes no mention of the arrangement of families by rank. Coos, Coquille, Siuslawan, and Tolowa houses of the southern Oregon coast and northern California were similar in design to Tillamook houses, containing anywhere from one to three or four families (Drucker 1937:236; Gould 1966:23; Miller and Seaburg 1990; Tveskov 2007; Zenk 1990a, 1990b). Archaeological excavations of south coast house features have been undertaken in three areas: the GLCRR, the northern Oregon coast, and the south ern Oregon coast. Much of the evidence from all three areas is dated to within the last 500-600 years, but a few excavated house features are much older than this. In the GLCRR, and particularly in the Wapato Valley, Kenneth Ames and colleagues and students have been engaged in a long-term program of Chinookan household archaeology, providing us with some of the best archaeological evidence of plank house interiors from anywhere on the Northwest Coast. Ames' work at the Meier site revealed the remains of a single, remarkably large house, 33 X 15 m, built around A.D. 1400 and con tinuously occupied until about 1830 (Ames et al. 1992; Smith 2004, 2006). The house had a row of</page><page sequence="16">92 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 74, No. 1, 2009 at least five discrete hearth boxes along its central corridor (Ames et al. 1992; Smith 2006:264). On either side of the hearth corridor were a complex series of deep, overlapping storage pits, forming "cellar trenches" (Ames et al. 2008). Smith (2004:28) argues that the north end of the Meier house was the high-status area, based on the pres ence of an anthropomorphically carved pumice item and a musket barrel. We believe that this infer ence, based on the presence of one "prestige" item and one trade good, is inconclusive, especially given the amount of disturbance caused by storage pit digging and fill removal that took place in the Meier house during its 400 years of occupation (Ames et al. 1992; Ames et al. 2008). From the rather even spacing of hearths along the midline of the house floor, it does not appear that family liv ing space at the north end of the Meier house was unusually large, as might be expected if the house chief occupied this end. In addition, it appears, from the published floor plan of the house, that storage capacity based on pit density was actually greater at the south end of the house (Smith 2006:236). If indeed the "owner" of the Meier house lived in the north end, his or her status is not clearly materialized in the archaeological evidence. Furthermore, there is no evidence that other fam ily spaces in the house were arranged by rank. Cathlapotle, also in the Wapato Valley, was a large town of at least 14 houses, established around A.D. 1450 and abandoned soon after 1830 (Ames et al. 1999; Sobel 2004,2006:166-169). Houses 1 and 4 have been the most thoroughly investigated (Sobel 2006). House 1, an exceptionally long struc ture, measured 55 X 10 m and was divided length wise into four discrete household compartments (Ames et al. 1999:37; Sobel 2006:168). The smaller House 4 (13 X 8 m) was undivided. Sobel (2006) found evidence of inter-household differentiation in wealth and status based on distribution and use of obsidian in Houses 1 and 4, but her analysis did not address the question of intra-household varia tion. Thus, from the archaeological evidence avail able, household hierarchy does not appear to have been materialized in the spatial order of Chinook houses. Elsewhere on the south coast, although sev eral older house features have been excavated (see below), there is no archaeological evidence for hier archical organization of house space. The Materialization of Hierarchy in Northwest Coast Plank Houses: A Summary In sum, ethnographic and archaeological evidence reveals a clear north-to-south gradient in the mate rialization of hierarchy within Northwest Coast plank houses. Where household hierarchies were most strongly developed, along the north coast and in the Wakashan subarea, family spaces were allo cated by rules of rank. The arrangement of fami lies in Wakashan houses followed a different pattern from north coast houses, but the rule was no less strong. Archaeological evidence from McNichol Creek shows that the north coast pattern is at least 1,600 years old, while the evidence from Ozette shows that the Wakashan pattern was in place at least 400 years before contact. Farther south among the Coast Salish and the south coast societies, as the importance of rank diminished, the material ization of hierarchy within the house became less visible. For the ethnographic period, no systematic rule for the allocation of family space by rank is evident in either subarea. However, archaeological evidence from Dionisio Point and (less clearly) from Shingle Point in the Coast Salish subarea sug gest that hierarchy may have been more strongly materialized in the spatial ordering of houses 1900 to 1500 years ago. Along the south coast, there is no evidence from any period that hierarchy was materialized in the spatial order of houses. Hearths, Storage, and Communalism in Northwest Coast Houses We turn now to the materialization of communal ism within Northwest Coast plank houses. We examine the number and location of hearths within houses, as well as the location of storage facilities, to ascertain the extent to which households pro duced and consumed as a single, communal unit. In a study of pre-contact Aleut houses, Hoffman (1999) found that several families living together in the same house often shared a single, central hearth for cooking and heating, but maintained their own storage facilities. He concluded that these households were communal in some activities (food preparation and consumption), but families worked independently in others (food storage). We suggest that household communalism is most clearly materialized in houses with one "commu</page><page sequence="17">Coupland et al.] NORTHWEST COAST PLANK HOUSES: A COMPARATIVE STUDY 93 I . II I I ? Figure 7. Schematic floor plan of a north coast house with a single, central hearth. Dashed lines enclose family sleep ing areas. nal" hearth (Matson 2003:80; Pearson and Richards 1994:41) and collective storage facilities. Con versely, household communalism is not strongly materialized in houses where families maintain their own hearths and storage facilities. In an ear lier section of this paper we argued that household communalism may have been more highly devel oped along the north coast, so again, we begin our comparative discussion there. North Coast Houses In north coast houses, as a counterpoint to the hier archical ordering of family spaces, communalism was materialized and reinforced in the presence of a single hearth in a well-defined (sometimes exca vated) space in the center of the house floor that, on a daily basis, was accessible to and used by all members of the House. Although north coast houses contained several families and could be quite large (Richardson Ranch house, 468 m2), they are consistently described in the ethnographies as having only one hearth, always located in the cen tral area of the house (Figure 7). It has been sug gested that this arrangement may also have worked to the benefit of House chiefs, who may have taken advantage of communal gatherings within the house to monitor the labor of subordinates and supervise the distribution of food (Brian Hayden, personal communication 2008). But de Laguna's Yakutat informants insisted that women of the House took turns feeding the household, so it does not appear that Yakutat House chiefs had the power to withhold food. In principle, we see no reason why a feature that ostensibly reinforces household communalism may not also have served the ambi tions of House chiefs, as long as all members of the House perceived that their needs were being met. We think it is much more likely that the House chiefs may have used the opportunity of the com munal meal to present themselves as generous and benevolent leaders, in the hopes that they might gal vanize the support of their household. In any event, north coast ethnographies frequently describe the central area of houses as a communal space. For example, in reference to Tlingit houses, G.T. Emmons (1991:68 [1916]) states, "The open cen tral space around the fireplace formed a common meeting place where all housemates sat, worked, and ate." Yakutat houses had a single, central hearth (de Laguna 1972:297). In an important passage, de Laguna describes variations to this design, stating that the Yakutat sometimes built houses with two hearths, but, she argues, these houses may not have served only as dwellings. "Some of these houses seem to have been at fishing places, serving to smoke fish, and therefore dispensing with such amenities as the [sleeping] bench in order to have two hearths" (de Laguna 1972:300). Two infor mants told her of large winter houses with two fire places, but de Laguna believed that these informants were mistaken; "neither of the last two men had ever lived in an old-style house..., and informants who had done so insisted that there was only one fire" (de Laguna 1972:300; emphasis added). Similar descriptions of the single, central hearth plan are given for the Chilkat Tlingit (Krause 1979:88 [1885]), the Tsimshian (Boas 1916:48; Halpin and Seguin 1990:271; Miller 1997:52), and the Haida (Blackman 1990:243; Fleurieu 1970 [1801]:400; Howay 1920). North coast archaeological evidence for the materialization of household communalism dur ing the European contact period conforms closely to the ethnographic model. Fladmark states that the hearth in the Richardson Ranch house "was found in its predictable location in the center of the house"</page><page sequence="18">94 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 74, No. 1, 2009 ^^nxn Sleeping Platforms Nnnnxv A ^^^ Clay Floor ?Nnv HI \^ Wk n4m Figure 8. Floor plan of House O, McNichol Creek site, showing central hearth. Indicators of high status, includ ing a clay floor and prestige goods, were found in the rear area of the house (see Coupland 2006:96). (1973:53). Also in Haida Gwaii, a large hearth was found in the center of the excavated house floor at Tclu'uga (Acheson 1991:432). In Prince Rupert harbor, a large (13 X 13 m) and completely exca vated nineteenth-century house feature at Kitan dach had but one hearth in a large square pit, the floor of which was planked, in the center of the house (Inglis 1973; MacDonald and Cybulski 2001:17). The lone north coast exception to the single hearth plan in the contact period comes from Psacelay on the Gitnadoix River in the Coast Tsimshian territory, where a 14 X 12-m house dated to the early nineteenth century had a large central hearth and six smaller peripheral hearths (Martindale 1999:224). As with some of the Yaku tat houses described by de Laguna, Psacelay was a summer settlement located at an important salmon fishing place, and the occupants of the house may have dispensed with the convention of a single hearth in order to smoke fish. The practice of using the single, central hearth plan is at least 1,600 years old on the north coast. House O at McNichol Creek had a massive central hearth (2.5 X 2 m), the only hearth recorded in the house (Figure 8; Coupland 2006; Coupland et al 2003). House E also had a central hearth, but Houses D and K, although smaller than House O, each had two hearths positioned along the center lines of their floors. These hearths all contained burnt bone fragments and are best interpreted as separate family cooking hearths. Thus, families in some of the smaller, "less hierarchical" houses at McNichol Creek may have had a greater degree of autonomy in daily domestic activities than the fam ilies in House O. House O, with its single, central hearth, and with its concentration of wealth and sta tus items at the rear of the house, simultaneously materialized both household communalism and household hierarchy to a greater extent than any of the smaller houses at McNichol Creek. Delving even deeper into the past, excavation of two house features at the Paul Mason site revealed that each had two cooking hearths posi tioned along the center lines of the floors (Coup land 1985, 1988). In terms of house size and number and location of hearths, these houses were very similar to the smaller McNichol Creek houses. The Paul Mason site households thus appear to have been characterized by a high degree of fam ily autonomy. Wakashan Houses The number and arrangement of hearths in Wakashan houses was distinctly different from north coast houses. Drucker (1951:71) describes Nuu-chah-nulth houses as having multiple hearths, one for each family, as well as a large, central hearth (Figure 9). He states, Near the center of the house was a large shal low circular depression that served as the fire place on ceremonial occasions, and near the corners and along the sides were smaller hearths used by the families occupying the house for daily cookery. ... Each individual family, whether of high rank or low, had its own fireplace [1951:71]. Thus, on a daily basis Nuu-chah-nulth families appear to have had greater autonomy in domestic activities than families in late pre-contact and con tact period north coast houses. Nuu-chah-nulth houses did have a central hearth, but it appears not to have been used by the household on a daily basis. The central floor space in which this hearth was located, however, appears to have been a perma nent feature of the house, and was likely used by the household as a work area or common space. Kwakwaka'wakw houses also had multiple</page><page sequence="19">Coupland et al.] NORTHWEST COAST PLANK HOUSES: A COMPARATIVE STUDY 95 i 4 3 I Figure 9.

"family" hearths in more or less the same arrange ment as Nuu-chah-nulth houses (Boas 1889:200; Codere 1990:365). Boas also states that the family spaces in the corners of the house were separated from "the main room," which presumably refers to a common space in the center of the house. In the archaeological record, House 1 at Ozette, the inferred high-status house, closely conforms to the ethnographic Wakashan pattern (Huelsbeck 1989; Samuels 1989, 2006). Samuels (2006:207) identifies 11 spatially discrete hearth areas within House 1, ten of which are positioned along the sides and ends of the house and are interpreted as family hearths. The remaining hearth is located in the central area or "main room" of the house and may represent the "ceremonial hearth" described by Drucker (Figure 10). Interestingly, this hearth is positioned at the south end of the main room, farthest from the back right corner thought to have been occupied by the House chief. If, indeed, it was a ceremonial hearth, why was it not located closer to the House chief's space? This central hearth appears to have been a permanent feature of the house, not merely an ephemeral shallow depression as described by Drucker. We suggest that this hearth may have been regularly used by the household for communal purposes, in addition to its possible cer emonial function. The smaller, lower status, Houses 2 and 5 had six and eight hearth areas respectively, all located in the corners or along the sides of the houses. Neither smaller house had a central hearth.

Floor plan of House 1, Ozette, showing central hearth and multiple "family" hearths around floor periph ery (adapted from Samuels 2006:207). in the corners furthest from the entrance and with its frequently used central hearth, we suggest that House 1 at Ozette, like House O at McNichol Creek, simultaneously materialized hierarchy and communalism to a greater extent than either of the smaller houses. Coast Salish Houses The number and placement of hearths in Coast Sal ish houses was different again. As among the Wakashan, each Salish family had their own hearth. In larger houses, hearths were arranged in two rows separated by a narrow walkway down the middle of the house, so that each family on either side of the house had a fireplace in front of their sleeping area (Figure 11). In smaller houses, hearths were arranged in one row along the midline of the house, each used either by one family or by two closely linked families occupying spaces on either side of the hearth (Boas 1891:12; Kennedy and Bouchard 1990:446; Suttles 1991:215; Suttles and Lane 1990:493). The relatively high degree of family autonomy within Coast Salish houses is seen not only in the fact that families kept their own hearths but also their own food stores, and they often went their own way in the summer to hunt, fish, and gather (Kennedy and Bouchard 1990:447; Suttles 1990:464). Unlike north coast and Wakashan houses, most Coast Salish houses had no perma nent central hearth or central communal space. Such a space could be created within the house for ceremonial events, but only by rearranging exist</page><page sequence="20">96 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 74, No. 1, 2009 I A I.A.I A I .i.|.i.j.a.

Suttles states, "For a big dance, the host took away whatever partitions separated the [family] sections of their house, moved the fires to make one or two in the center... and created a large open area" (1991:218). Farther south, Quinault houses had separate family hearths (Olson 1936:64; Willoughby 1969:267 [1886]). Recognizing the delicate balance between household communalism and family autonomy, Olson describes the Quin ault household as "a democratic one, almost com munistic in many respects, though each family had its own fire for warmth, cooking, the drying of meat, etc." (1936:91; emphasis added). Turning to the archaeological evidence from the Coast Salish region, the placement of individual hearths in each of the inferred family spaces in the early contact period house at Sbabadid is consis tent with Suttles' description of ethnographic houses and suggestive of a high degree of family autonomy (Chatters 1989:171). However, Chatters also argues that the southwest corner of the house may have been a communal work space or storage area. More than 20 hearth features in the house at Tualdad Altu clustered mainly in two areas of the house, the east and west ends. There was no cen tral hearth. Chatters (1989:174-175) interprets both ends of the house as family areas, similar to the lay out of the house at Shingle Point. In the roughly contemporaneous and similarly sized House 2 at Dionisio Point, hearth areas were identified in the southwest, northwest, and northeast corners, and one larger hearth was located roughly in the cen [i jk il N 1 i i _ 'J Om 4m Figure 12. Floor plan of House 2, Dionisio Point site, show ing corner "family" hearths and central hearth (adapted from Grier 2006:106). ter of the house (Grier 2006:106). Modern tree growth may have obscured a fifth hearth in the southeast corner. Grier infers that all four hearths were family hearths, with the larger central hearth belonging to the House chief. But the arrangement of small corner hearths around a large central hearth closely resembles the ethnographic Wakashan pat tern (Figure 12). Furthermore, Grier identifies a sixth area of the house adjacent to the central hearth which he refers to as "open floor space" (2006:106). Thus, depending upon how one interprets the spa tial evidence, the presumed "chief's hearth" in House 2 may actually have been a communal hearth within an open central floor space that was acces sible to all members of the house. House 2 is dated to the late Marpole period in the Gulf of Georgia region. Although a full discussion of Marpole is beyond the scope of this paper, the Marpole cul ture is widely regarded as the preeminent example of pre-contact complex hunter-gatherers on the Northwest Coast (Ames and Maschner 1999; Mat son and Coupland 1995). It is not surprising, there fore, that household hierarchy is reflected in the distribution of wealth and prestige items in House 2 (as we noted earlier). But the spatial order of House 2 may also reflect a high degree of house hold communalism, complementing the increase in hierarchy during Marpole. Multiple hearths in the house features at Scowlitz (Lepofsky et al. 2000:400) and Xay:tem (Mason 1994:91) indicate a degree of family auton omy. Interestingly, the Maurer house had a 3.5 m long, linear hearth complex crossing the south end of the floor, but nothing comparable in the north end or center of the house (Schaepe 2003:133). We are not sure how to interpret this plan.</page><page sequence="21">Coupland et al.] NORTHWEST COAST PLANK HOUSES: A COMPARATIVE STUDY 97 Figure 13. Schematic floor plan of a south coast house with multiple family hearths arranged along the midline of the house floor, no central hearth. Dashed lines enclose family areas. In this view, families facing opposite each other shared the same hearth. Some south coast houses, such as the Meier house and Cathlapotle House 1, were much longer with many more hearths. South Coast Houses In a famous passage that inspired Lewis Henry Morgan, the communal arrangement of Chinook houses was described by Meriwether Lewis in 1806: several families of these people usually reside together in the same room; they appear to be the father &amp; mother and their sons with their sons' wives and children; their provisions seem to be in common and the greatest harmony appears to exist between them [Moulton 1990:221-222]. Nevertheless, Chinook families tended their own hearths, and Chinook houses were not normally equipped with communal hearths or spaces. Hajda (1994:180) remarks that hearths were spaced along the midline of the house and often framed in planks. A hearth could serve one family or two occupying spaces on either side of the hearth (Figure 13). Parker (1967:187 [1838]) described a Chinook house at Clowewalla in the Wapato Valley as being divided into family sections, each about six meters long and partitioned from the others by hanging mats. Each family had its own hearth. In Tillam ook houses, hearths were commonly arranged along the midline of the house floor. The most com mon arrangement seems to have been four fami lies and two hearths, with "a family on each side of the fire" (Jacobs 2003:71; Seaburg and Miller 1990:561). In southern Oregon coast houses, each family had its own hearth (Miller and Seaburg 1990:582; Zenk 1990a:569). u 4\ \\ \\ ^^^^ \ \ Om 4m v-^ Figure 14. Floor plan of the house at the Meier site, show ing central row of box hearths and smaller non-box hearths. The palimpsest of hearths at the south end of the house was surrounded by a dense cluster of large, over lapping storage pits (adapted from Smith 2006:236). Archaeological evidence of household com munalism from the south coast generally conforms quite closely to the ethnographic model. In the GLCRR, the Meier house (Figure 14), with its cen tral row of five hearths, was almost 15 m wide, so it seems likely that families occupied spaces on either side of each hearth, forming "fireside groups" (Ames et al. 1992). With no evidence of division into separate household compartments, the Meier house appears to have held a single household of as many as ten families, but the multiple hearths and family-controlled storage pits ("cellar trenches") suggests that families or fireside groups within this extraordinarily large house had consid erable autonomy. Despite its great size, there is no evidence within the Meier house of a common area for all household members. Indeed, the long, lin ear houses of the Chinook and other south coast societies seem designed to separate families rather than bring them together, a design more in keep ing with collectivism than communalism. Given the</page><page sequence="22">98 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 74, No. 1, 2009 length of the Meier house (33 m), it is difficult to imagine that the families occupying opposite ends of the house had much daily interaction. At Cathlapotle, House 1 is estimated to have had a remarkable 14 hearths along the central corridor, including five in House Id and two in House lc (la and lb were not completely excavated; Ames et al. 1999; Smith 2006:264). House 4(13X8 m) had a central corridor with three hearths. The hearths in all of these houses are best interpreted as fam ily hearths, and like Meier, the Cathlapotle house holds seem to have been incorporative with the houses designed to emphasize family autonomy. At Clahclellah, 85 km upriver from Cathlapotle, the remains of seven plank houses, ranging in size from 48 to 100 m2, have been identified (Sobel 2004:373, Sobel 2006:169-171). Most of these houses, occu pied from about A.D. 1700 to 1856, had only a sin gle central hearth (Smith 2006:264; Sobel 2004:396-407, Sobel 2006:169). Of particular interest is House 209 at Clahclellah, which, at 100 m2, was about the same size as House 4 at Cath lapotle. But whereas House 4 had a row of three "family" hearths, House 209 had one central hearth (Sobel 2004:396-398). Based on dwelling size, both houses may have held about the same num ber of people. But based on number and location of hearths, their households appear to have been organized very differently. We suggest that the fam ilies in House 209 at Clahclellah, who cooked and ate around the same hearth, formed a more cohe sive, communal unit. On the northern Oregon coast, excavated house features from different time periods at Nehalem Bay, Netarts Sandspit, and the Palmrose site all conform closely to the ethnographic Tillamook model. Two excavated house features at Nehalem Bay measured 17 X 8 m and 18 X 8 m, and were occupied for about 150 years beginning in the late A.D. 1600s (Losey 2002,2005). The site at Netarts Sandspit was a village with two rows of plank houses occupied from about A.D. 1250 to the mid 1700s (Losey 2005; Newman 1959). Houses 12 (16 X 4.5 m) and 13(12X5 m) were extensively exca vated (Newman 1959:23-27). The oldest excavated house feature on the southern Northwest Coast, at the Palmrose site, was occupied over a 1,500-year period beginning about 2750 B.P. (Connolly 1992; Phebus and Drucker 1979). The house measured 18 X 6 m. Houses at all three sites were long, nar row, and had central corridors with multiple, often overlapping, hearths that probably served as fam ily hearths. There is no evidence in any of these houses of communal hearths or storage areas. Excavated house features at several sites on the southern Oregon coast and the northern coast of California closely resemble ethnographic dwellings of Athapaskan-speaking groups in the region (Berreman 1944:22; Erlandson et al. 1997; Gould 1966; Heflin 1966; Lyman 1991:125; Newman 1959:39; Tveskov 2000, 2007). Ranging in age from the late pre-contact period to the mid nineteenth century, many of these houses were small, contained only one or two hearths, and are thought to have been single family or small extended family dwellings. The Materialization of Communalism in North west Coast Plank Houses: A Summary In sum, ethnographic and archaeological evidence reveals a north-to-south gradient in the material ization of communalism within Northwest Coast plank houses based on the number and location of hearths and, where identifiable, placement of stor age areas. Three distinct floor plans can be identi fied along this gradient. The single, central hearth plan was common along the north coast, and archaeological evidence from the McNichol Creek site indicates this plan is at least 1,600 years old. Houses with a central hearth and multiple family hearths were built in the Wakashan area, and in ear lier times (ca. 1600 B.P.) this plan may have extended as far south as the Gulf of Georgia (Dion isio Point). Houses with multiple family hearths, but lacking a permanent central hearth, were com mon ethnographically in the Coast Salish area and along the south coast, where this plan may have considerable antiquity. We suggest that household communalism is most clearly materialized in the single, central hearth plan of the north coast. Here, families, regardless of rank, cooked, ate, and gathered around the central hearth. No doubt during the cold winter months, families even slept around the central hearth. It was the sym bol of household solidarity, the feature that drew housemates together, creating cohesiveness within the house. In contrast, the standard Wakashan plan materialized household communalism less strongly. Finally, Coast Salish and south coast houses and hearth arrangements seem to have been designed</page><page sequence="23">Coupland et al.] NORTHWEST COAST PLANK HOUSES: A COMPARATIVE STUDY 99 more with family autonomy in mind. The organi zation of these households may have been more collective or incorporative than communal. We do not doubt that Coast Salish and south coast house holds sometimes produced and consumed as a unit or that families could rely upon each other when needed, but their houses do not materialize com munalism as strongly as north coast houses. Discussion Scholars studying transegalitarian societies have devoted their attention almost entirely to the emer gence of hierarchy and to the various forms hier archy takes (e.g., Hayden 1995), while communalism has become something of a forgot ten issue. What happens to communalism in the Houses and households of transegalitarian soci eties as hierarchy develops? We have argued that, discordant as they may be, hierarchy and commu nalism coexist in the households of transegalitar ian societies in a fine balance that is negotiated and reproduced through everyday practice. In our view, increasing hierarchy does not spell the end of household communalism. Indeed, it may even lead to a strengthening of certain aspects of commu nalism. We believe the evidence from Northwest Coast Houses (and houses) supports this view. Students of the Northwest Coast culture area have long recognized that hierarchy, in the form of the title system and the emphasis placed on social ranking, was more highly developed on the north coast than it was farther south. But it may surprise some to see strong evidence of communalism in north coast houses, too. The ethnographic and archaeological evidence show that north coast Houses had stable membership and that families routinely shared in commensal activities. Despite differences in rank, these families did not prepare and consume food separately in their own corners of the house. They did not have their own hearths to do so. Instead, they came together on a daily basis to cook and eat at the "communal" hearth. Sharing of these activities within the house was part of daily practice, and was a powerful statement of house hold communalism. Why was communalism so strongly emphasized in north coast houses? After all, Leland Donald (1997:279) has stated that "from the titleholder's point of view, they [commoners] are like dogs or slaves, so great is the gulf between titleholder and commoner." Why then would a north coast House chief condescend to take his meal and his leisure at the same hearth as a commoner? If titleholders separated their sleeping spaces from commoners, why not separate cooking and eating space, too? Paradoxical as it may sound, we suggest that fos tering certain aspects of communalism such as the sharing of domestic space was itself a strategy for the social reproduction of the hierarchical north coast House. As we have seen, hierarchy perme ated north coast society. Titleholders displayed their rank and privileges conspicuously at public events, and less obviously, but no less importantly, in the arrangement of family spaces within houses. To paraphrase Yvonne Marshall (2000:102), hierar chy was "performed into existence" by north coast Houses, both publicly and in daily practice. But there was a cost to this constant performance of hierarchy, the benefits of which accrued only to high-ranking titleholders-it threatened house hold solidarity. Why would lower-ranking members of the House wish to "help their chief if his only concern was his own status and renown? Since House chiefs depended on the support of their household for the production of surplus that enabled them to pursue their social ambitions, and since this support could not be coerced, chiefs may have had no choice but to formally recognize their support ers by sharing some of the glory. Solidarity feasts were one form of recognition (Perodie 2001:192-194). We suggest that the daily sharing of commensal activities at the communal hearth was another concession north coast House chiefs made for their displays of rank and privilege. Household communalism was "performed into existence" at the central hearth. Farther south, Coast Salish and south coast household hierarchies were less developed and public displays of rank and privilege were far more muted than in the north. Household solidarity was not threatened by the constant performance of hier archy, so as a result, there may have been less need to "perform" communalism in Coast Salish and south coast Houses. The Wakashan societies of the central coast are somewhat anomalous in that they had developed hierarchy to the same extent as north coast societies, but they do not seem to have promoted communalism to the same extent. Wakashan House membership was less stable and</page><page sequence="24">100 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 74, No. 1, 2009 families, tending their own hearths, were more autonomous in domestic activities on a daily basis. On the other hand, Wakashan houses were equipped with a central hearth and "main room," which may have functioned as symbols of house hold solidarity, even if these features were not used as routinely as they were in north coast houses. Wakashan Houses may, therefore, have been inter mediate between northern and southern Houses with respect to communalism. The positive relationship between hierarchy and communalism is seen archaeologically in mater ial remains from the Richardson Ranch house, House 1 at Ozette, House 2 at Dionisio Point, and House O at McNichol Creek. These houses mate rialized hierarchy in the distribution of wealth and prestige items. At the same time, hearth arrange ments in each of these houses materialized house hold communalism. The houses that most clearly materialize hierarchy also objectify household communalism. Our comparison of north coast, central coast, and south coast Houses illuminates a stark contrast. Where hierarchy was strongly developed and overtly displayed, household communalism was actively reinforced. And where hierarchy was less developed, household communalism was weaker. In short, it was not hierarchy or communalism in Northwest Coast Houses, it was hierarchy and communalism. In terms of a broader theoretical context, North west Coast House chiefs balanced hierarchy and communalism in their leadership strategies. At the inter-community level, Feinman (1995:268-274) has argued that Northwest Coast chiefs attempted to build power through a "network" strategy in which the acquisition of wealth and prestige is based on personal connections outside the local group and control of prestige goods (Blanton et al. 1996; Trubitt 2000). The marking of prestige dif ferences, characteristic of the network strategy, is most clearly seen on the north coast and in the Wakashan subarea, less so farther south. But at the household level, aspects of the "corporate" leader ship strategy, in which power is shared across groups, were also practiced in the north (see Blan ton et al. 1996; Feinman 1995; Trubitt 2000). As we have seen, the northern House with its long-term stability, not the House chief, was the subject of rights and obligations (although, clearly House chiefs manipulated this arrangement). Indeed, Northwest Coast scholars have observed that the concept of corporate ownership was stronger in the north than in the south, where individuals more frequently exercised ownership rights (Riches 1979:151; see also Suttles 1951:222). Thus, the "communalized hierarchies" of the north coast, where network and corporate strategies were prac ticed at different scales (Blanton 1998:146-148), may be contrasted with the less overtly hierarchi cal, but more individualized household collectives farther south. Was the communalism in north coast houses "real" or was it nothing more than a "performance," an elite strategy to "mask" social inequalities within the House? We believe the communalism was real, every bit as real as the hierarchy within these houses. True, commoners and low-ranking title holders had little or no control over wealth and prestige goods which circulated almost exclusively among titleholders (Ruyle 1973), and marginal ized household members undoubtedly worked harder and performed more menial tasks than their high ranking kin (Oberg 1973:87). Not all aspects of communalism were promoted in these Houses, but some were. Through the shared use of a com munal hearth and access to a common area of the house, the material lives of lower-status House members were improved. What better way to build community and solidarity within the multifamily household than by sharing food and cooperating in commensal activities? Most importantly, because these practices occurred daily, they became routine, ingrained in habitus. Elites and non-elites may have understood household communalism differently. For House chiefs, it was a concession (perhaps a strategy) they made in order to achieve their social ambitions. But, for socially marginalized members of the House, resources were being shared and then lives were better for it. They were included, made to feel as if they belonged, and that is the essence of communalism. This leads to important question, that of agency. Thus far, we have suggested that building commu nalism was an elite strategy intended to persuade followers to continue to support their chief. But this view grants agency only to elites. Non-elites have agency too, especially in transegalitarian societies (Brumfiel 1992). Through small acts of resistance, followers may have refused to "help their chief if</page><page sequence="25">Coupland et al.] NORTHWEST COAST PLANK HOUSES: A COMPARATIVE STUDY 101 they felt they were not being properly treated. Hav ing the power to withhold or slow down labor, non elites may have demanded fair treatment and inclusion in the successes of the House as much as elites strategized to give this to them. Balancing the tension between hierarchy and communalism is always a work in progress, constantly being nego tiated by all members of the House in the unfold ing of quotidian practices and routines. Finally, we turn to the house itself. Northwest Coast plank houses materialized hierarchy and communalism, to a greater or lesser extent, depend ing on how deeply ingrained these taxonomic prin ciples were in the social order. In the southern areas of the Northwest Coast these principles were not so deeply ingrained and consequently were not materialized to any great extent in the spatial order of houses. But in the north, where hierarchy and communalism were vital, plank houses very clearly and very strongly materialized both principles through the hierarchical arrangement of family sleeping spaces and the presence of a single, "com munal" hearth. The spatial order of north coast houses (and to a lesser extent, Wakashan houses) represents the material outcome of the dialectic between hierar chy and communalism. We suggest that this out come was highly successful because it was so widespread and so assiduously practiced through out the north coast region by the time of European contact. Ingrained in habitus, the spatial order of these houses continuously reinforced the impor tance of hierarchy and communalism to their occu pants. This is Blanton's (1994) notion of "canonical communication," where deeply rooted cultural val ues are inculcated through continuous nonverbal communication by the house. We take Blanton's notion one step further. By simultaneously com municating hierarchy and communalism, the house played a crucial role in easing the tension between these two principles. Encoded in the spatial order of the house, hierarchy and communalism were made to appear not contradictory, but compatible, an inevitable part of an ordered system. And the ten sion between them was in some measure resolved. Acknowledgments. Earlier drafts of this paper were read by R.G. Matson and Bonnie McElhinny.

The actual term used by Morgan is not communalism, but the more controversial "communism in living." 2. For Levi-Strauss the house was a social group, but physical dwellings are also houses. To avoid confusion, we will refer to the social group as House and to the physical dwelling as house (see also Ames 2006). 3. Two other house depression features were found at the Paul Mason site, each located several meters away from the core group of house features arranged in two rows (Coupland 1988). One of these features was much larger than the ten houses in the core group. It appeared to the principal investi gator that this larger house feature was of a much more recent origin than the houses in the core group, but admittedly, this assessment was not tested through excavation.
