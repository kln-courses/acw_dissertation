<plain_text><page sequence="1">More Remarks on the Bengali Deity Dharma, Its Cult and Study Rahul Peter Das My essay on the Bengali Deity Dharma (Das 1983) was meant not only as an introduction, but also as a critical discussion on the method- Anthropos 82.1987</page><page sequence="2">Berichte und Kommentare 245 ology of study,1 which would be - mutatis mu- tandis - applicable to other, similar cases too. Until and unless one develops a method of investigation based on objective criteria only and banishing all speculation, and until and unless one strives to collect as much relevant material as possible and then lets only this (in full, not just as selected parts) speak for itself without trying to press it into the mould of preconceived notions and "models," one is sure to create an unsatisfactory state of affairs simi- lar to the one I described in my paper. In this connection the methodology developed in clas- sical Western (i. e., Greek and Latin) philology could serve as an example, as it has also served as an example in the field of Vedic philology.2 Since there is, however, not much more that I could add on the subject of methodology, I shall here confine myself - with the exception of maybe a few remarks - to supplementing Das 1983. After the publication of this paper (which seems to have - quite surprisingly - attracted more than a little attention), I have procured further information which at times augments my previous information, at times lets one look at the same matter from a slightly different angle. Firstly, I would like to draw attention to the brief but interesting discussion on the Bengali Dharma in Basu 1978: 199-210, as well as to Mukhopãdhyãy 1981: 34-68; these supplement the introductory studies mentioned in Das 1983: 662. 3 As regards the spread of the cult of Dharma in Bengal (cf. Das 1983: 663), atten- tion may here be drawn to C. C. Sanyal 1965: 139, who states that Dharma is also wor- shipped among the Rajbansis of North Bengal (and that the officiating priest may, interest- ingly enough, even be a Kamrupi Brahmin), as well as to Basu 1978: 210, who mentions that the old Dharma of Calcutta is still worshipped as Bäkä Ray.4 Interesting too is H. Sanyal 1982, who draws attention to the fact that most of the important poets of the Dharmamangal were from Western Rãrh (p. 3), and also opines that the struggles portrayed in the narrative of Dhar- ma closely resemble those between the Malla rulers and the Zamindar of Bardhamän (Burd- wan) in this area (pp. 15-22). However, the Bengali Deity Dharma, or at least certain aspects of this deity, is or are in all probability nothing specifically Bengali; I did - in passing - draw attention to this, but the whole deserves a more thorough discussion. As it is, there are deities called Dharma or having a related name (especially Yama5) in many other parts of the Indian subcontinent among many different peoples, and the Bengali Dharma seems to represent only one strand of a multi- tude of intertwined deities and cults having ram- ifications along the length and breadth of this whole area, encompassing such disparate regions as the Hindukush and Tamil Nadu (cf. esp. Das 1983:677 note 37, 678 note 39). Of course this does not necessarily mean that the similarities are in all cases more than those of name only, but we are at present in no position to pass final judgment, since a deeper and more thorough investigation of the problem is still pending. Many of the deities which will have to be studied in this context have hardly attracted the attention of scholars so far, or else have not been studied in a way which facilitates compara- tive studies. The cults and deities which are most acces- sible to scholars in this respect come from the extreme South and the extreme North of the Indian subcontinent. As regards the former, I 1 My two publications dealing with similar method- ological problems referred to in Das 1983: 696 have since appeared as Das 1984a and Das 19845 respectively. 2 For a particular case of methodological differences in the field of religious studies see the two reviews of Unbescheid 1980: one merely praising the work (Zoller 1985), the other a detailed and far more sober evaluation (Lienhard 1985). J On the story (legend) of Dharma as told in the Dharmamañgal see also Chatterji 1982: 77 ff. 4 Cf. Das 1983: 693 f. - For the etymology of bäkä and bãkurã see also Elizarenkova and Toporov 1979. - On the place-name Dharmatalã see also Sen 1982: 17, who notes correctly that tala is often added to the name of a particularly mentionable local tree, deity etc. (i. e., in this case the deity Dharma), but then adds that the name may have come from Hindustani dharam talãv (talão in Bengali script), i. e., "Dharma pond," though we have no eviden- ce for this assumption. 5 In this connection see also Hillebrandt 1918: 228, who draws attention to the Yamapattika in ancient and mediaeval India. On Dharma in Old Indo- Aryan literature see also A. K. Bandyopãdhyãy 1978: 488 f. Anthropos 82.1987</page><page sequence="3">246 Berichte und Kommentare am extremely grateful to my colleague Ms. Ulrike Niklas, M. A. (at present at the Univer- sity of Cologne), who was kind enough to point out to me the numerous parallels between Dharma and the South Indian Aiyanãr (Tarma) Cãstã (Tamil orthography), i.e., Aiyanãr (Dharma) Sãstã, often also called Aiyappan (according to Adiceam 1967: 2, the first part of his name corresponds to ãrya, even if it is not clear whether it is actually derived from this word). He too seems to be a composite deity. What is particularly striking is that he is inti- mately connected with (often white) horses and sometimes elephants (cf. Das 1983: 685). He rides around the countryside at night with his host to ward off danger - a trait which the Ben- gali Dharma does not seem to have. Note also that other South Indian deities too are connect- ed intimately with horses (Adiceam 1967: 3 note 5). What is however particularly intriguing is the fact that Aiyanãr too has a rite like the Gäjan of Siva (Beng. Sib) and Dharma in Ben- gal (cf. Das 1983: 688 f.). That his priests are on the whole not Brahmins goes without saying, and he is also given sacrifices of goats, pigs, chicken, and alcohol (Adiceam 1967: 4 note 10; cf. Das 1983: 684, 691). For an introduction to this deity see, apart from Adiceam 1967 (with an extensive bibliography and bibliographical notes), also Reiniche 1979: 21, 29 ff., 36 f., 56, 73, 182 ff., 194 ff., 199 ff., 219 ff., 248, and esp. 113 ff.; see also Irwin 1983b: 351. On Sãstã in Kerala cf. also Menon 1976: 10 ff. As regards the extreme North, a lot of information on the deity Yama(rãja)/Imra = Mara (no etymological relation!) is contained in Jettmar 1975 (index: 511, 515, 524). It may also be mentioned here that figures on horses (cf. above) have, along with discs (see below) also been found among the rock drawings in the Indus valley.6 Worthy of note too is that kãla "time" is also an appellation of Yama, and that Time is also represented as a wheel (see below). The known fact that Yama is, at least in the Pura- nas, considered to be a son of Sûrya should also be added. Attention was drawn to discoid representa- tions of Dharma (see esp. Das 1983: 679, 683). According to Irwin 1983a: 264, there is a con- nection between the sun-wheel and "hook- swinging," which is, as is well-known, also a part of the Gãjan (Das 1983: 688 f.; on the Cafak, as the rite of hook-swinging is called in Bengali - and also the Gãjan -, see also D. Ray 1982: 116-124, Bagchi 1984: 261-264). Note too that the illuminated disc around the sun when it is covered by light clouds is called dharmasabhä "Dharma's court" (K. Ray 1977: 274). On discs and discoid objects and drawings in the cult of Dharma and parallels elsewhere cf. also Stolla 1984. In this study the author documents (with copious bibliographic material in German and many illustrations) the importance of discs as representations of the sun in prehistoric cults and religions, drawing his material mostly from Western and Northern Europe. Taken together with my previous remarks and references, this shows that the discs of Dharma are in all probability remnants of an ancient belief that was prevalent in nearly the whole of Eurasia and as such nothing specifically Indian; they could thus be "Aryan" as well as "non-Aryan." Stolla 1984 also draws attention to the symbol- ism of these discs not only as representations of the sun, but also of the cosmos, which of course at once reminds (merely this; not more at this stage!) one of the mandala in Indian religions, thus opening a possible new area for research. Note, however, also the round shape (among several shapes) of the Indian yoniy a name for the vedi and the fire-altars, the podest for idols and of course the well-known yoni-symbol (cf. Foy 1916). Stolla 1984 has, by the way, turned his attention mostly to discs with crosses and documented how Christianity has later incorpo- rated these symbols (cf. Maringer 1980, Irwin 19836: 339, 352). He also draws renewed at- tention to drawings of footprints from Europe and their symbolism in pre-Christian religions: they signify the presence of a deity (1984: 322 ff.). Thus this feature of the cult of Dharma and indeed of Indian iconography too is nothing specifically Indian (as was known before, but is rarely mentioned). 6 Jettmar 1984 (cf. Das 1983: 697). Jettmar has also published several other papers on the Indus valley rock drawings; see the bibliography in Jettmar 1983: 164. Anthropos 82.1987</page><page sequence="4">Berichte und Kommentare 247 Connected with discoid representations of Dharma are also representations of or refer- ences to him as a tortoise (cf. Das 1983: 680). On the solar symbolism of the tortoise see also Patii 1983: 188 ff., on Varuna and the tortoise also Meyer 1937/3: 226 note 1. See ibid, also on mahãkaccha, which Meyer takes to be = mahä- kacchapa = Varuna, but cf. also Mayrhofer 1956-1980/3: 776 on this word. Discoid shapes and the like are of course not the only representations of Dharma. Das 1983: 678, for instance, mentioned certain anthro- pomorphic representations of this deity. There are also other anthropomorphic represen- tations of Dharma. One of the most striking is a huge image of Dharmarãjã, to be found on the third floor of the Asiatic Society's new building in Calcutta. A sign at the base of the image states: "Brass Image of Dhurm Rajah found at the Capture of Buxa 7. December 1864. Said to be 100 years old. Presented by: - Capt. Hadyat Ally." This sitting figure appears to be a Bodfoi- sattva, but with a Moghul-style bearded face and headgear (with tantric syllables) and a bandolier-like belt over his right shoulder. A photograph of the figure at its former location in the old building of the Asiatic Society is to be found on p. 43 of the weekly Dee 51.1984, 10 (7. 1. 1984). This image shows a certain amount of Buddhist influence, which is not surprising, since the cult of Dharma in general does - as is well-known - show a considerable amount of this. In this connection I would like to express my thanks to Anonymous 1985 for drawing attention to Sarkar 1917: 147, 193, who refers to the Buddhist triad of Buddha, Dharma, and Sañgha, in which Dharma was at one time portrayed as a female. For a more detailed discussion see Das Gupta 1976: 275 ff., 338 ff.; cf. also Dasgupta 1974:93, 97 f. Sarkar does refer to possible influences on the Bengali Dharma cult, but this refers not to the female Dharma, but to Buddhist influence as a whole, for there is no trace of any female Dharma in the Bengali cult. I state this again because the remarks of Anonymous 1985 could be interpret- ed as meaning that such a female deity indeed exists or existed in this cult and that Mitra 1972 and Das 1983 were concerned mostly with this. As it is, the most we could say is that the Buddhist triad might have had some influence on the relationship between Dharma and his female consort(s)/ See on this Das Gupta 1976: 278 ff.; cf. also Das 1983: 689 ff. But note that according to Pâlit 1912: 259, in the Gãjan of Dharma the central role was originally that of Àdyâ, who is often identified as Sakti or Durgã (also according to the Sanskrit lexicographers; see also H. Bandyopãdhyây 1978: s. v.). Àdyâ was, according to Pâlit, later ousted from her actual role by Siva (Beng. Sib). See also Pâlit 1912: 79. As regards the connection between Siva and Dharma, attention may be drawn to the remarks on "hook-swinging" above. Das 1983: 687 f. also drew attention to the Unga. In this context cf. on the Bänalinga also chapters 205 and 206 of the Aparãjitaprcchã (see Mankad 1950) and chapter 14 of the DIparnava (Som'purä 1960: 209-221). Note also that phal- lic symbols are supposed to protect fields from harm (cf. Meyer 1937/1: 18 and esp. Eibl-Eibes- feldt 1978: 595-601). On the connection be- tween pillars (posts) and dharma cf. also Irwin 1983a: 279 note 55, on the connection between pillars and the sun, p. 264 f. (cf. Das 1983: 678 f f., 673 note 26). On the Tree of Life see also Schroeder 1916. On a special connection between a post and the dead in association with ancient Indian sodalities (see below) cf. Falk 1986: 87 f. On pillars and the Tree of Life see also Irwin 1983b (see also esp. p. 345 on dhar- ma). The most striking point of similarity be- tween the two deities of course remains the Gäjan (see esp. Das 1983: 688 f.). It may not be out of place to note here that A. Ghos 1977 attempts, probably for the first time, to edit critically some of the Bengali and Sanskrit songs and chants of the Gâjan (Gambhîrâ - probably 7 On one of these, namely Sasthï (cf. Das 1983: 690, 665 note 11), see now Kapp 1983. See in this connection also Meyer 1937/1: 6 f. on the role of the cat as a fertility-bringer, esp. in Germanic mythology. With regard to another female deity, aitala, it may be of interest to note that Ullük (cf. Das 1983: 686 f., 690 f.) is her vãhana too (Pâlit 1912: 324). Incidentally, I remarked on Hariha- riharivähana Lokeávara with regard to Dharma's vãhana (Das 1983: 686); on Harihariharivãhana Lokeávara see now Brinkhaus 1985. Anthropos 82.1987</page><page sequence="5">248 Berichte und Kommentare an older name or form - in some parts of West Bengal). His collection is based on a part of the north of Bardhamän (Burdwan) District in West Bengal. The oldest comprehensive and in many ways still unsurpassed study on the Gambhïra is, by the way, Pâlit 1912, who, esp. in the second section of the first part and the first section of the second part of his book, examines the relation between Dharma and the Gambhïra in detail too. The most recent study of the Gambhïra is to my knowledge P. Ghos 1982; on Dharma see pp. 4ff., 16, 22 f. Das (1983: 689 note 68) remarks with skepticism on a possible connection between the Gãjan and ancient Indian sodalities. This view will proba- bly have to be revised in the light of Falk 1986, which does show that there could be a link. Note esp. that the leader of a sodality (= the human Rudra) was, as a "living corpse," ob- liged to live a life of abstinence quite different from that of his followers (= the human Maruts). Could this trait of the leader gradually have been conferred to his followers too, at least for certain periods of time? Note too that Falk shows that the sodalities were regarded as "dogs"; this at once reminds one of the dog accompanying Bhairava and Dharma in classi- cal Indian literature and art, though of course this does not - as yet - necessarily imply a link. In this connection let me draw attention to the "sports" associated with the cult of Dhar- ma. In 1984 a Bengali colleague in Calcutta, whose name I do not for obvious reasons wish to divulge, showed me coloured photographs of clandestine "games with corpses" (mafã khelã; cf. Das 1983: 687 note 60), in this case the corpse of a small child. The pictures, taken in a village of Western Bengal, show that the tradi- tion is still very much alive, though on the whole secret.8 Lastly, I would like to touch the subject of etymology, which I broached in connection with my critique of Mitra 1972. It is of course true that it is often possible to explain a rite or a custom with the help of etymology, but such an explanation. can be taken seriously only if it is methodologically sound (cf. also Das 1985: 263). In this connection I may mention again my explanation of the rite dãon ãnã (Das 1983: 666 f.). That my derivation and explanation of dãon as "bunch/bushel" is correct is shown by Krsiparãáara 206 ff. (see Majumdar and Banerji 1960), where a rite in several respects similar to that mentioned by Mitra 1972: 13 is described and called mustigrahana "taking a fist(ful) or fists(ful)," which more or less tallies with what is called in Bengali "bringing [in] the bunch/ bushel."9 Not only this, but the rite mentioned in the Krsiparãáara is also still alive even today; cf . Cakrabartï 1984: 7 f., who describes the rite of mut ãnã "bringing [in] a fist(ful) or fists(ful)." On similar rites in various cultures (also Indian) and on their significance see also Meyer 1937/3: 307 („Letzte Garbe"), though it must be admitted that there may be a difference in significance between such rites carried out before and afìer the cutting of the corn (the rites described by the Krsiparãáara and Cakra- bartï 1984 are carried out before the corn is cut). As regards the ãkhyãn din discussed by Das 1983: 675, see A. Ghosh 1987. On Santali lar10 (Das 1983: 669 f.) cf. also Sen 1979(52): "Sever- al animals, either ferocious and [sic] venom- ous, are not at all named at night. Thus a tiger is mentioned as pokã 'a vermin,' a snake as lata 'a creeper'." I must also mention that Anony- mous 1985 draws attention to the fact that Bodding 1932-1936/4: 41 has an entry for lar (which I would call lar1) "fibre," and a separate entry for lar (= lar1) "row (of a necklace etc.), string of beads." Anonymous uses this to postu- late that lar1 is an Austro- Asiatic word, where- as lar2 (variant: lar) is an Indo- Aryan loan. But 8 For the discussion of human sacrifices amongst the Aryans (Das 1983: 692 note 71) see also Hillebrandt 1886: 709 ff. and 1917: 16 notel, 18. On such sacrifices (and cannibalism) in connection with ancient sodalities see Falk 1986: 16, 36 ff. On special days connected with similar sacrifices and/or the dead (cf. Das 1983: 672 f.) see also Falk 1986: 41 ff., 71, 96 f., 146 ff., 189. See also Gode 1960: 187-260. 9 The Sanskrit text Krsiparãáara dates probably to the middle of the eleventh century (see Gopal 1980: 30). 10 Please change lãr in Das 1983 to lar throughout to tally with the system of transcription used by Bodding 1932-1936. Anthropos 82.1987</page><page sequence="6">Berichte und Kommentare ^¿q this is not at all what Bodding says; in fact, Bodding, in connection with lar1, expressly draws attention to Hindustani lar, which means "row (as lar2); individual strand (of a rope or the like)" and also asks us to compare lar1 and lar2. That is, lar1 and lar2 are in fact not to be separated. Moreover, Bodding also has a sepa- rate entry lar4, which is derived from one of the above words, probably lar1, i. e., Bodding has separated his entries here according to meaning, not to etymology (cf., e. g., the two lejraha entries on p. 84). This, taken with my etymological remarks in Das 1983: 669 f., makes it very probable that the words in ques- tion are all not of Austro- Asiatic origin. I must however apologize for not having been more explicit, as my references to Bodding seem to have left some room for doubt.11 11 Regarding the pronunciation of r and r, please change "North-West" to "North" in Das 1983:683 note 51.
