<plain_text><page sequence="1">HENRY TRUBNER A BRONZE DAGGER-AXE A mong the vast holdings of early Chinese archaeological material in the Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto, there is an extremely rare and unusual bronze dagger-axe which has hitherto escaped attention and proper classification (Figs. i-2)'. According to the Museum's records, the object in question was reported to have been found at Hsin-yang Chou, in Southern Honan, when Bishop White bought the piece in Shanghai in November, I931. The object sub- sequently became part of the permanent collection of the Royal Ontario Museum in December of the same year. It was catalogued simply as a "bronze halberd", leaving a great deal of latitude as to period and proper classification. For reasons which will be explained below the writer does not believe that the weapon is properly speaking a ko, which it has sometimes been called, though it is related to dagger-axes of this type. Moreover, no exact parallels to this particular weapon, either in shape or decoration, are known to exist within the main stream of Chou or Han art to suggest that the object was produced at one of the principal cultural centres of this period. A date within the limits of the Han dynasty seems in order (206 B. C.- A. D. 22o), but the dagger-axe was probably made either in southern China or south-east Asia, possibly Tonkin, in former French Indo-China. The dagger-axe consists of an oblong tang or shafting-plate (nei) and a long, rather broad blade placed symmetrically in relation to the tang. The tang has an oblong horizontal slit. Two vertical slits to facilitate lashing to the handle, which was presumably of wood, are placed on the shoulder of the blade, which terminates in two projecting points. The blade is rather wide and heavy in feeling, with incurved lower edge and slightly convex upper edge, terminating in a blunted point with bevelled edge. Technical analysis shows that the blade was originally longer, but that part of it has been broken off and the point was subsequently refinished in its present form. It is likely that the blade was originally sharper and more pointed, particularly when compared to a similar piece in the Museum in Hanoi, which will be discussed belowz. Seen in profile, the blade is slightly down-curved, with both the upper and lower edge serving as cutting surface. The blade is provided with a hole, surrounded by a border of radiat- ing lines. A median line runs from the tip of the blade to the hole, but disappears in the upper part of the blade. The hole, which was cast and not drilled, is irregularly rounded and roughly finished, with remnants of the casting fins still in place. Examination of the hole, the two Acc. No. NB. 3 156.

The occurance of the hollow casting technique is most unusual, and quite contrary to the normal Shang and Chou practice of casting solid blades. Examination of the large number of ancient Chinese bronze weapons in the collection of the Royal Ontario Museum has not re- vealed a single similar example of hollow casting. Nevertheless, despite the fact that the blade is hollow, the weapon is quite heavy3. It is covered in parts with a thin, smooth patina of dark green color. The dagger-axe shows even more remarkable peculiarities when we turn to the decoration on tang and blade (Fig. 2). Both sides of tang and blade have an identically cast decoration to which there are few parallels. The tang, instead of being finished in a straight line, as is custom- ary in the majority of ko type dagger-axes of Shang and Chou date, terminates in an open double-crescent scroll, with a projecting centre point between two hooks. The crescent-shaped device, in outline somewhat reminiscent of the Buddhist trident in early Indian art4, forms part of the border of a squarish panel, ornamented with five curious beings, some of them of semi- human appearance, outlined against a sunken background. The centre figure is seen full-face, with the arms extending sideways and the hands joined with one of the hands of the next figure Each pair of hands is provided with five upturned and elongated fingers, resembling spikes rather than fingers, which are thus shared in each instance among two figures. The second arm of the side figures is not shown. Their curiously shaped, thin bodies, which are seemingly seen in profile and give the appearance of being hunch-backed, end in fish-tail-like legs, one of which is bent sideways and up, the other, in the opposite direction, joining one of the "legs" of a pair of more decidedly animalistic creatures in the lower register of the group, creatures which in turn are joined to the "legs" of the central figure. Both sides of the tang, in other words, have a cast design of five strange creatures, consisting of three larger ones of semi-human character, with joined hands, enclosing within the same area two smaller animal-like creatures to which they are joined by fish-tail "legs". The five figures are thus intertwined and joined to each other to form a single group. There are further important peculiarities. The central figure has a round head which forms a continuous line with the neck. The side figures have heads which are also seen full face. But here all similarities with the central figure end, for the heads of the side figures are of triangular shape, with convex contours forming a point at the top, from which emerges what looks like a curled lock of hair. However, the triangular outline of the heads might also be explained as actually representing a headdress or cap of triangular shape. The curled object at the top of the head might in that event represent a tassle. The eyes of all the figures, including the pair of animal-like creatures, are indicated by a sunken outer circle, combined with an inner circle and raised dot, the latter representing the pupil. The same "eye" design also appears on the chest of the round-headed central figure, here apparently used as ornament. The nose is simply suggested by the narrow passage left between the two outer circles of the eyes. No attempt has been made to show the nostrils or raised 3 Weight 282 gr. 4 Cf. the Bo Tree relief on the South pillar, East Gate, of the Great Stupa at Sanchi. H.

A sunken crescent-shaped line suggests the mouth. The strange mask-like faces produce a feeling of primitive simplicity and grotesqueness, a quality further enhanced by the curious half-human, half-animal bodies. The ornament on the tang is bordered on two sides by a design of three parallel, sunken lines, and the same border design, but with only two sunken lines, is carried into the double- crescent at the end of the tang. We have already referred to some of the peculiarities of the blade, namely the hole, sur- rounded by a circle of radiating lines, and the hollow casting technique. Even more surprising is the decoration on both sides of the blade, found within an irregularly shaped panel which oc- cupies the space between the slits on the blade shoulder and the double-circle with radiating lines bordering the hole. The panel, which is wider at the top and demarcated on its four sides by incurved contours, shows a repetition of the grotesque figures with curious fish-like bodies, pointed head and lock of hair (or headdress with tassel) already noted on the tang. On the blade the decoration consists of a pair of such figures, with single arm and single, joined hand with five extended fingers, framing within the area formed by arms and bodies a single animal-like creature, identical with the pair of such creatures on each side of the tang. A minor new ele- ment of the decoration on the blade, worth pointing out, however, is the inclination of the two pointed heads to fit the curved contour of the panel, whereas on the tang all the heads are straight and in strictly frontal view. The strange but exceedingly interesting dagger-axe seems to have no parallels among an- cient Chinese bronze weapons from central and Northern China. But in an article already re- ferred to by Olov Janses, published in the Bulletin of the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities, Stock- holm, which deals with a group of bronze objects from Southern China (Yiinnan) and Indo-China, there is reproduced a drawing of a bronze weapon in the Musde de I'Ecole Frangaise d'Extreme- Orient, in Hanoi, which is almost identical with the bronze weapon in the Royal Ontario Mu- seum6. The object was reportedly found in the Tonkin Delta, in former French Indo-China. It is not stated whether the object is hollow cast, but it has the same type of tang, open at the end, an oblong slit in the lower part of the tang, two slits for hafting in the shoulder of the blade and the characteristic round hole with border of radiating lines. By far the most interesting aspect of the piece is the striking similarity of its ornament on tang and blade, consisting of an almost identical representation of figures with pointed heads in combination with smaller grotesque figures resembling animals. The only notable difference seems to occur in the orna- ment on the tang, where all three of the larger figures have pointed heads, whereas on the weapon in the Royal Ontario Museum, the central of the three figures has a round head. The blade shoulder, at least on the basis of the drawing, also seems more curved, accompanied by more down-turned shoulder points. The fact that the Hanoi piece apparently has its blade intact enables one to reconstruct more precisely the original shape of the Toronto example. The blade of our weapon may have been close to 5o mm. longer, to make up the difference between the present overall length of 190 mm., as against 240 mm. overall length of the Hanoi piece, for it may safely be assumed that the two 5 See Note 2. 6 Ibid., p. Ii 5, Fig. II; O. Janse, Archaeological Research in Indo-China, Cambridge, 1947, I, P1. 137, No. 4. 174</page><page sequence="6">weapons were originally of approximately equal dimensions. Judging by the companion piece in Hanoi it would also be safe to say that the blade of the Toronto bronze terminated in a sharper, more triangular point. At the same time, the additional length must have given a considerably greater sweep to the concave line of the lower cutting edge, and far greater ele- gance of design to the object as a whole. The fact that the Hanoi dagger-axe was found in the Tonkin Delta is highly significant, for it raises the possibility that the object was either imported from Southern China, or else was made by Chinese artisans established in Indo-China. Chinese settlers established themselves in Northern Annam, in what constitutes the present province of Thanh-ho4, very likely as early as the third century B.C., for at that time the Chinese began to infiltrate Northern Indo-China, especially Tonkin. By the beginning of the second century commercial intercourse between China and Chiu-chan, the ancient name for the district corresponding roughly to the modern Thanh-hod, must have been well established. While our knowledge regarding the earliest Chinese settlements in Northern Annam is still incomplete, we have ample evidence as to the close relationship between the Han empire and Indo-China. During the Han dynasty a kingdom known as Nan-yiieh extended from the region of Canton deep into Indo-China as far as the present Central Annam. In the year i i i B. C. the Nan-yiieh kingdom was conquered by the Chinese and divided into nine districts, one of which was the district Chiu-chen (Annamese Cu'u-chin), already referred to7. The suzerainty of the Han empire over Thanh-hod, and regions even further south, was thus firmly established. The majority of the bronzes which may be compared with relics of the Huai style ex- cavated in China, were discovered at the dwelling-site of D6ng-so'n, situated on the right bank of the S6ng MI River, about eleven kilometers NNE of the town of Thanh-hod. Some of the objects excavated here must have been imported from Southern China, while others seem to have been made locally, under strong Chinese influence8. Among the finds were numerous bronze weapons reminiscent of similar objects from Shou-chou in Anhui and Ch'ang-sha in Hunan, which for the most part may be assigned to the Warring States period and early Han Dynastyg. It is perhaps significant to note, as pointed out by Janse, that in the brick tombs in Tonkin and in Thanh-ho4, mostly belonging to the Later Han, weapons occur only very rarely, particularly bronze weapons. The site of D6ng-so'n was apparently destroyed, and perhaps abandoned for some time, in the first century of our era, when Chinese armies under General Ma Ytian, who had been des- patched to crush a local rebellion, invaded Thanh-hod in A. D. 43. The Chinese armies crushed the uprising, killing "five thousand" men, and deporting "hundreds" of families to Southern ChinaIo. Others managed to flee before the advancing troops of Ma Yian. It is likely that D6ng- so'n, occupying a position of commercial and strategic importance was destroyed in the course of the hostilities, an event which would account for the fact that most of the objects found at D8ng-so'n seem earlier than the majority of objects discovered in the brick tombs and ap- parently belong for the most part to the Earlier Han Dynasty. 7 Janse, op. cit., I, p.

The dagger-axe in the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities has a transverse tubular socket which slightly ex- ceeds the width of the blade, but also has several striking features in common with the weapons in Toronto and Hanoi, namely the tang with open end and rounded edges, the shape of the blade, which is provided with a raised median line and an irregular hole surrounded by a ring of radiating lines, and in particular the unusual decoration of highly stylized creatures with triangular heads, joined "hands" and "feet" which Janse would identify as "frogs (?)" with their front and hind feet in commonIz. Andersson has made the suggestion that perhaps these creatures are lizards rather than frogs3. There would be a logical raison d'-tre for the presence of frogs, which were used widely as a decorative motif throughout Indo-China during the Bronze Age, for the croaking of the frogs was believed to bring about and announce the coming of abundant rain, upon which the people depended to fertilize the fields which they had sownI4. The representation of frogs was par- ticularly common on bronze drums from Southern China and Indo-China. However, careful examination of the dagger-axe in the Royal Ontario Museum fails to convince one that the creatures on tang and blade are frogs. Except for the curious beings in the lower register of each group, which may represent animals, though surely not frogs, the peculiar figures with pointed heads and curl of hair (or tassel) at the top, and particularly the centre figure on the tang, with rounded head, would seem to be human or semi-human figures, rather than animals. If animals were represented, then how is one to explain the curled finial at the top of the pointed heads? Moreover, the mouths and eyes look decidedly more human than animal. To be sure, the curl does not seem to appear on the figures on the axe in the Museum of Far Eastern Anti- quities, nor apparently, judging by the drawing reproduced in Janse's article, on the dagger-axe in Hanoi. But otherwise the figures on the three objects are so similar in style that one is led to believe that the same identification holds true for all three objects. As the figures on the Toronto piece do not seem to be animals, but anthropomorphic representations, the writer suggests the same identification for the other two examples. A fourth related piece may be cited, namely a dagger in the Musde de 1'Ecole Frangaise d'Extreme-Orient, Hanoi, which has been found in Tonkin15. The object is of particular interest for on the hilt of the weapon is a representation of stylized figures, with pointed heads, which Janse would again identify as frogs. The figures are somewhat different from those on the other objects described above, though similar in that they have the pointed, in this instance lozenge- shaped, heads and the head and body shown in direct frontal view with arms and legs (or front and rear legs) spread sideways. While in the case of this dagger we might indeed have frogs, we still cannot accept as frogs the figures on the other objects, especially not in the case of the Toronto dagger-axe. 11 Janse, "Un groupe de bronzes," Pls.

However, a date in the Earlier Han dynasty is perhaps more appropriate, considering that the D6ng-so'n culture was at the height of its florescence during that period and the fact that the infiltration of Chinese immigrants and the spread of Chinese culture into Indo-China was very widespread in the second and first cen- turies B. C. Moreover, the type of dagger-axe represented by the example in Hanoi and in the Royal Ontario Museum is related to Chinese dagger-axes of considerably earlier date, going as far back as the Shang Dynasty. The dagger-axe, occuring in a number of different forms, was the most widely used and most characteristic weapon of the Bronze Age in China. It remained in use from the latter part of the second millenium B. C. until the beginning of the Christian era. The typical dagger-axe was hafted at right angles to a rather thin stick, thickened and bent back at the top, and held in an upright position. Typologically, the dagger-axe in the Royal Ontario Museum and the corresponding ex- ample in Hanoi belong somewhere between Loehr's dagger-axe types I and II, namely those with broad triangular blades with tang (k'uei) and those with slender blades with tang (ko)16. Loehr's first category is characterized by triangular outline of the blade, which often has a broad base, rectangular nei, and as a rule a round perforation in the blade. This perforation oc- curs on most examples, but as Loehr points out, the fact that it is sometimes omitted, dem- onstrates that it was not a structural necessity'7. One may therefore assume that the hole in the blade of the Toronto dagger-axe also had no structural necessity. Other characteristics of the type k'uei are the usually symmetrical placing of blade and tang, the presence of variously shaped holes on the tang and two vertical slits for hafting in the base of the blade. The dagger- axe in the Royal Ontario Museum has the slits in the base of the blade and the crested blade of rhombic section, associated with some examples of the k'uei type weapon. Two characteristic Shang examples of the k'uei from An-yang, now in the collection of the Royal Ontario Museum, illustrate some of the points in common with the Indo-Chinese type of dagger-axe (Figs. 4-5)I8. Both are distinguished by perforated rectangular nei and hole in the blade. The blades in both instances are slightly down-curved, with a simple midrib in the one example, and a pro- minent midrib decorated with stylized cicadas and topped by a t'ao-t'ieh mask surrounding the blade hole in the other example. This k'uei, in particular, relates in shape to that of the Indo- Chinese type of dagger-axe, but at the same time, the long slender and slightly down-curved blade of the latter is more in keeping with the ko of Loehr's type II9. However, the typical ko (Fig. 3) combines the slender blade with lugs or shafting wings at the base, and in none of the examples illustrated by Loehr does the ko appear with the two vertical slits in the base, which are characteristic of type I, the k'uei. In other words, the Indo-Chinese dagger-axes combine features of both the k'uei and ko, without actually corresponding to either of them. Examples of the k'uei are very rare compared to the more common ko. It has therefore been suggested that the k'uei was in use for only a short period, preceding the ko types, which i6 Max Loehr, Chinese Bronze Age Weapons, Ann Arbor, 1956, p. yo; see also p. 51, Fig. 44 and p. 54, Fig. 45.

Perhaps the k'uei was an indigenous Shang type, whereas the other variants of the dagger-axe (Loehr's types II-IV) are known to have persisted from the Shang period to the end of Chou. The two dagger-axes of Indo-Chinese type, in the Royal Ontario Museum and in the Musde de 1'Ecole Frangaise d'Extreme-Orient, in Hanoi, form part of a group of similarly decorated objects, namely the dagger-axe with socket in the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities, and the dagger with decorated hilt in Hanoi, already referred to. The Royal Ontario Museum's dagger- axe was reported to have come from Honan, but serious doubt is raised as to the accuracy of this information. The other pieces of the group were either found in Tonkin (i. e. the two weapons in Hanoi) or else were acquired from dealers in China, as were the dagger-axes in Stock- holm and the Toronto example. One may perhaps assume that the latter two objects are also of Southern Chinese or Indo-Chinese origin, but found their way into the art market in China. All the weapons of the group, distinguished by the peculiar decoration of anthropomorphic or animalistic figures, may have been imported into Indo-China from Southern China, or else may have been produced by Chinese artisans established in Indo-China. Typologically as well as stylistically the weapons in question are quite different from any known examples from Northern China. However, the very fine casting, examined first-hand in the case of the Royal Ontario Museum's dagger-axe, suggests that Chinese artisans may have been responsible for the work- manship. A suggested date for the two dagger-axes, in Toronto and Hanoi, in the Earlier Han dynasty would seem to be corroborated by the fact that the Chinese dagger-axe, from which both examples seem to derive, continued in use in China without any major changes until the end of Chou. An early Han date, in the 2nd or Ist century B. C., a period during which cultural and commercial relations between China and Northern Indo-China were very close, would therefore account for the typological relationship between the two dagger-axes of Indo-Chinese type and characteristic dagger-axes from China, as illustrated by Figs. 3 and 4. Approximately the same date would seem in order for the other related examples of the group. I9 Loehr, op. cit., p. 54, Fig. 45. 20 Ibid., p. 5 2 178</page></plain_text>
