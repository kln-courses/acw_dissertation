<plain_text><page sequence="1">Poetry and Politics in Northern Ireland Edna Longley The antagonist of imaginative writing in Ireland is not a habit of scientific obser- vation but our interest in matters of opinion S. . All fine literature is the disinterested contemplation or expression of life, but hardly any Irish writer can liberate his mind sufficiently from questions of practical reform for this contemplation. Arts for Art's sake, as he understands it, whether it be the art of the Ode on a Grecian Urn or of the imaginer of Falstaff, seems to him a neglect of public duty. It is as though the telegraph- boys botanised among the hedges with the undelivered envelopes in their pockets . . . W.B. Yeats, Explorations, pp. 197-8 Poetry and politics, like church and state, should be separated. And for the same reasons: mysteries distort the rational processes which ideally prevail in social relations; while ideologies confiscate the poet's special passport to terra incognita. Its literary streak, indeed, helps to make Irish Nation- alism more a theology than an ideology. Conor Cruise O'Brien calls 'the area where literature and politics overlap' 'an unhealthy intersection'; because, 'suffused with romanticism', it breeds bad politics - Fascism and Nationalism.1 But it also breeds bad literature, particularly, bad poetry, which in a vicious circle breeds - or inbreeds - bad politics. As Yeats says: 'We call certain minds creative because they are among the moulders of their nation and are not made upon its mould, and they resemble one another in this only - they have never been foreknown or fulfilled an expect- ation.'2 Ulster poets today are sometimes the vic- tims of improper 'expectations'. Whatever causes they may support as citizens, their imaginations cannot be asked to settle for less than full human truth. And no cause in Ireland (unlike, say, oppos- ition to Adolf Hitler) carries such an imprimatur. This does not let the poet off the hook of general or particular 'responsibility' towards political events. The price of imaginative liberty is eternal vigilance. Yet Yeats's very formulation gives the poet a national if not a Nationalist role. And in the early years of the century creating literature and creat- ing a nation could validly be seen as concentric labours. Even Yeats's later reflections on the transition from cultural to political nationalism balance profit and loss: 'This is not'. I say, 'The dead Ireland of my youth, but an Ireland The poets have imagined, terrible and gay.' But later still, Louis MacNeice anticipated O'Brien by wondering: what is a nation? Have with you to the Post Office! Was it a nation They gave their lives for, was it rather a gesture That as in a poem, a play, a flourish of brushwork, Gives meaning to an accident, in passing Confirms what was not there? So in their passing Did sixteen men impose upon their fellows An unsolicited poetry? Which, needless To say, as soon as it could rel psed to prose A land of priests and grocers. 'Unsolicited poetry' has also influenced British political life. Newbolt and Brooke manufactured the same kind of rhetorical bullets as did 'the rhymed lesson book of Davis' and Pearse's prayer- book of blood sacrifice. The Falklands Sun was the dustbin of imperial poetry, as is An Phoblacht of Republican poetry. Perhaps poetry always coarsens to verse before it really influences action. Thus Wilfred Owen's protest was also a form of literary criticism, correcting a false vocabulary, imagery, and consciousness. Although Yeats disliked Owen, and although his politics after 1916 were neither single nor simple, essentially he moved into the same critical mode: 'We, who seven years ago/Talked of honour and of truth'. Certainly the breaking of nations loomed larger than the making. But if Yeats's vision pivots on construction versus destruction, Ulster poetry since 1969 has felt little of the former possibility. Its inevitable ancestor is not Cathleen Ni Houlihan but 'Meditations in Time of Civil War'. Aidan Matthews argues that the poets 'are engaged upon a profound and responsible quest for community; an idiom of restoration and homecoming pervades their work.'4 He may overstate the pluses, though such aspiration counts even as a subtextual pres- ence. But beyond imageries of homecoming and 26</page><page sequence="2">healing, poetry as therapy for 'wounds', the very existence of the poetry repeats in new terms Yeats's effort towards 'unity of culture', what F.S.L. Lyon calls 'cultural fusion'.5 A corollary of this, and of Mathews' argument, is that poetry can be 'political' only on behalf of its own values. Yeats of course placed the tension between poet and man of action at the centre both of his personal drama and of his aesthetic. His attacks on other 'opinionated minds' (on women of action as poems marred by politics) were sharpened by his own suppressions: 'it is a hard law that compels us to cast away our swords when we enter the house of the Muses, as men cast them away at the doors of the banqueting hall at Tara'.b When we glimpse the occasional sword-flash or slash, Yeats's poetry too coarsens, and confirms his point. But on the whole, that lament of 1905 legitimately fathers this retrospect in 1935: 'I have been always a propagandist though I have kept it out of my poems./ Thus, although Yeats and Abbey Theatre policy supported the Nationalists during the Anglo-Irish war,8 critics quarrel over whether the 'rough beast' of 'The Second Coming' (1919) most resembles the IRA, or the Black and Tans, not to mention Bolshevism or Fascism. The rhet- orical question at the end of the poem was never meant to be answered in the way Malcolm Brown demands: 'there has probably never been a reader of "The Second Coming" who has not been dis- satisfied with its generalities'. And Brown calls Yeats's universal suggestiveness 'forensic masking'.9 Earlier, the techniques of Yeats's 1916 poems had marked the limit to which his poetry could swim with a political current. By adopting popular forms he fulfilled (as before in 'September 1913') his youthful ambition 'that the ballad-writers might be the better'.10 But in writing these last and greatest 'Songs and Ballads of Young Ireland', Yeats rediscovered the rift between 'the obsession of public life'll and the private imagination. He delegates reportage and commentary to the im- personal medium ('I write it out in a verse') or to third persons ('O, words are lightly spoken', Said Pearse to Connolly'). Again all three poems - 'Easter 1916', 'Sixteen Dead Men', 'The Rose Tree' - are concerned with another dichotomy: not simply that between word and deed, but be- tween debate and symbolic act, prose and poetry. The transforming power of Yeats's poetry contem- plates an equivalent transformation in the outer world ('changed utterly'). 'Sixteen Dead Men', much quoted during the Hunger Strike, weighs the language of reason, the terminology of argument, in a scale where they cannot win: And is their logic to outweigh MacDonagh's bony thumb? This perception parallels Seamus Heaney's 'two languages' in North (the definitions of political journalism as compared with those of 'religious intensity'), except that Yeats stands outside both. He registers the politico-poetic potency of the bony thumb, the rose tree, the rosary of names which he too helps to weave into legend. But in a sense his own poetry extricates itself from this poetry that has become public property. In 'Easter 1916' Yeats's bardic voice as spokesman ('Now and in time to be,/Wherever green is worn'), al- ternates with the poet as man speaking, 'troubled' by 'Hearts with one purpose alone'. The pronouns of the poem, 'they and I' 'We', approximate to Yeats's shifts between solitariness and solidarity. 'A terrible beauty is born' suggests, among other things, that the Rising and its consequences gave him more poetry that he had 'solicited'. Seamus Heaney has been under greater pressure than other contemporary Ulster poets to reconcile Yeats's divorce. Mark Patrick Hederman, for in- stance, looks to him as 'the most potent Orpheus who would lead us through that psychic hinterland which we shall have to chart before we can emerge from the Northern crisis'.13 I have argued else- where with reference to North that psychic hinter- lands may be imaginative dead ends.14 But the demands made on Heaney testify to the persistent Irish belief that within one tribe, one nation, the poet's organic bardic function can still be per- formed - without the fissuring strains of 'Easter 1916'. John Montague's conviction that 'What's in the poet's blood must speak through him', percolating 'a slow drip-drop of knowledge', con- trasts with the Protestant John Hewitt's cate- gorical 'I have no evidence to support the fact that (Northern poetry) has made any difference at all' 15 The literary intellectual too assumes (or assumes that he has) more prominence in Irish than in British life. Seamus Deane explains: 'in literature at least Ireland has sometimes overcome the severe physical limitations of its geography and of the catastrophic burden of its history.'16 Des- pite - or because of - Joyce, Faustian overcompen- sations beckon. Deane makes this claim in a retros- pect on Crane Bag, which has often hovered over O'Brien's 'unhealthy intersection'. In the first issue Richard Kearney's 'Beyond Art and Politics' begins: 'Politics is far too grave a matter for the politician. Art is far too potent a medium for the artist'.17 What is already powerful should not be encouraged to covet art's 'potency', and vice versa. In the same issue, Deane's interview with Seamus Heaney introduces a key Crane Bag word, 'atavism', another intersection of literary and 27</page><page sequence="3">political emotion. With regard to O'Brien's demy- thologising of Republicanism, he asks: 'is not his humanism . . . being used as an excuse to rid Ireland of the atavisms which gave it life even though the life itself may be in some ways brutal?'18 Despite the plural, 'atavism' is never applied favourably to Ulster Protestant gut-feel- ings. Try this triad: 'I'm atavistic; you're bigoted; he's a terrorist'. In the 'Forum' Crane Bag Kearney's study of similar Irish journals approves those that 'refused the polarization of literature and politics into opposed discourses'.19 Rebuking Sean O'Faolain's forgiveable weariness after six years vain crusade in The Bell, he comments: 'he now has recourse to the individualistic model of the romantic, solitary poet nursing his genius far from the madding crowd'.20 (Note the weasel- word 'individualistic', presumably as used in Chinese self-criticism sessions). O'Faolain in fact signed off: 'It may be, and one hopes so, that somewhere, some young poet, scornful of us and our controversies, has been tending in his secret heart a lamp which will, in the end, light far more than we can ever do.'21 How many lamps did Yeats light? The dwindling optimism of The Bell may still accurately graph Irish realities. Contrary to Kearney's strange accusation of a 'partitionist' mentality, O'Faolain understood Ireland's truly partitionist gang of 'Little Irelanders, chauvinists, puritans, stuffed-shirts, pietists, Tartuffes, Anglop- hobes, Celtophiles'.22 And no editor of a Southern periodical was ever more generous to the whole of Northern culture. I doubt whether any reconcil- iation, as Kearney retrospectively urges, of 'the socio-political debate' with 'the literary debate' would have modified his 'defeatism' - or his de- feat. In fact Crane Bag, sucked back like so much else in the South by the undertow of the North, seems partly anxious to remythologise what O'Faolain, before O'Brien, demythologised. O'Faolain's first editorial asserted: All our symbols have to be created afresh and the only way to create a living symbol is to take a naked thing and clothe it with new life, new association, new meaning, with all the vigour in the life we live in the Here and Now.2 3 And in 'Tradition and Creation', written twenty- five years after the Rising, he insists: 'The process of liberation ... will go on until we have got rid of that Old Man of the Sea - our Glorious Past; and that equally tyrannical Old Man of the Sea - our Great Future.'24 Richard Pine, in the 'Forum' Crane Bag, also equates these chimerical tyrants, rejecting 'a mythical past because that leads only to a mythical future.' As he shrewdly observes: 'The dispossessed Gaels of the early eighteenth century looked forward in their aislingi to re- demption by a Stuart saviour, unaware that their future, if it existed at all lay among real rather than illusory alternatives'. However, the editorial, while stating that Ireland stands at a 'cultural crossroads'; also offers this sophistication of the backward look: we might take our cue from Brian Friel when he writes in Translations that "it is not the literal past, the 'facts' of history that shape us, but images of the past embodied in lang- uage". A central preoccupation of this Crane Bag is the problem of how, if at all, the in- herited "images of the past" may be trans- lated into idioms for a new society.26 A cue from Translations? Does Translations itself renew 'images of the past', or does it recycle a familiar perspective? Is it an aisling? Translations has its context in the poetic and political nexus of the Field Day theatre company, whose directors include Seamus Heaney, Seamus Deane and Tom Paulin. The Forum Crane Bag juxtaposes Friel's account of translating 'history' ( a word which has replaced 'atavism' as flavour of the month, though it means much the same) with the re- actions of John Andrews who wrote A Paper Landscape, the history of the nineteenth century Irish Ordnance Survey that gave Friel ideas. Kevin Barry introduces their dialogue: It is certain that both history and fiction imagine and structure a past which neither could make known without sharing the images and structure of narrative. Both discourses enable the entry of what has been lost into a society's understanding of its present.27 However, his description of Translations assumes more than 'imaginative' accuracy: 'The "hidden Ireland" emerges from Friel's play . . By imagin- ing an unwritten past Friel translates a defeated community into the narrative of history.'28 Has it never been so translated before? As O'Brien asks, 'if Ireland were ever to cease to be oppressed, what would happen to "history", how would one get into it?'29 Andrews the historian gets nearer the mark when he reads Translations as 'a play about late twentieth-century Ireland' whose 'real subject . . . is the relation between authority and alienation.'30 The play does not so much examine myths of dispossession and oppression as repeat them. 28</page><page sequence="4">When Friel's soldier-researchers deploy unhis- torical bayonets after Lieutenant Yolland goes missing, his subject is the behaviour of British troops in the Catholic ghettoes of Belfast and Derry during the nineteen-seventies. At the end of the play Owen, who has 'collaborated' with the Survey, reverts to potentially violent tribal loyalty. He rejects the translated names as 'A mistake, my mistake, - nothing to do with us.' Owen's final adherence to 'fact' ('if Yolland is not found, we are all going to be evicted') contrasts with the concluding attitudes of Hugh, his drunken hedge- schoolmaster father. Hugh accepts linguistic change, and advises: 'Take care Owen. To remember everything is a form of madness.' In one sense, then, Hugh has taken his other advice: 'we must never cease renewing (the images of the past); because once we do, we fossilise.' But the 'language' here appears theoretic, chosen with Crane Bag already in mind. And Owen is the doer, Hugh the dreamer who turned back on the road to '98. Hugh himself embodies a nostalgia: for the hedge-school era, for a land of saints and scholars, for Ballybeg as a kind of Eden. In his last speech Aeneas making good the fall of Troy stands in for another restored civilisation: 'a race was springing from Trojan blood to overthrow some day these Tyrian towers.' Friel, then, translates contem- porary Northern Catholic feeling into historical terms. He does this very well. But the play is partly 'fossilised' because he explores the ethos of a particular community exclusively in relation to British dominion over the native Irish. No per- spective discriminates between past and present, nineteenth-century Ireland and twentieth-century Northern Ireland. There is simply equation (as in North). Translations refurbishes an old myth. Its imagery, structure of feeling, and cultural vision correspond to John Wilson Foster's account of Montague's The Rough Field (if we substitute culture for agriculture), itself perhaps a seminal work behind both Translations and Heaney's Wintering Out: The Ulster Catholic writer has lived so long with the imagery of land-decay and land-loss that he has become addicted to it . . . What he wants is not progress, a forward-looking reversal of decay through agricultural im- provement, but rather a return, the recovery of a politico-spiritual impossibility - a mythic landscape of beauty and plenitude that is pre-Partition, pre-Civil War, pre- famine, pre-plantation and pre-Tudor.31 Field Day, like Hugh, 'dreams of a perfect city' as well as a promised land. Hence Paulin's romantic programme-note to Friel's later play The Communication Cord (a farce which com- fortably fails in its intention to subvert the pieties of Translations): anyone who looks at the Hobbesian civic wilderness which is Derry now is likely to nourish a similar dream. Nevertheless, they can also perceive that there is in Derry an effort at civil definition which appears to be absent, or at least less keenly felt, in Belfast and Dublin. Imaginatively, Derry is the most advanced city in Ireland and the Guildhall is a temple which joins the stained, bright images of empire to the idea of a new res publica. More evidence please! The projection on to 'history' of contemporary aspirations accords with the Republican viewpoint from which history stands still: that refuses to accept the internal Northern vendetta as at least a variation on the old colonial theme, that writes Northern Protestants out of history unless pre- pared to go back and start again in 1798. Other members of Field Day have adopted such pro- jections both as an artistic and an argumentative strategy. The simplicities of the strategy, if it con- tinues, make Field Day less likely to create, in Kearney's words 'a "fifth province" of cultural understanding and exchange, where the divisions of the four political _provinces might be con- fronted and resolved.' -'(Perhaps Ulster readers are better equipped than Southerners to crack the codes that emanate from part of one province). Tom Paulin's collection of poems Liberty Tree, as its title suggests, attacks contemporary Unionism for betraying the French and Irish Re- publican principles of '98. His ideal unifying symbolism of 'dissenting green', 'the northern starlight', 'the green tide rising/through Mayo and Antrim' (another pre-lapsarian dream), carries less poetic conviction than his satire, which cas- tigates the Northern state in the light of British colonialism: Chitchat evaporates at this charred altitude Like letters airmailed to Great Namaland Or Deeko's postcards to his old headmaster Who wrote the school would be most pleased to learn Of his promotion to the Chair of Social Justice At Jan Smuts college in the Orange Free State. He thanked him also for his learned article "Samuel Twaddell: a Co Down Man at the Cape". 29</page><page sequence="5">Even now, at a bring-and-buy in Cleaver Park, His Aunt Mina is telling Lady Lowry, "That boy's gone far, but we've heard noth- ing yet." However, when Paulin comes nearer home, he can- not temper the extremist techniques of satire for purposes of inward dissection: This bitter village shows the flag In a baked absolute September light. Here the word has withered to a few Parched certainties, and the charred stubble Tightens like a black belt, a crop of Bibles. ('Desertmartin') That cliched, external impression of the Pro- testant community exposes Paulin's own 'parched certainty.' At least he notices that community's exist- ence. Seamus Deane's Field Day pamphlet, Civil- ians and Barbarians, resembles Translations and North in concentrating on the Anglo-Irish axis. He traces current discussion of 'terrorism', dirty protesters and hunger strikers, back to Spenser's (1612) comment on the 'stern and savage nature'33 of the Irish, Coleridge's (1814) fear of 'a wild and barbarous Race',34 and other English smears. (Spenser's rise to fame as the anathema of the Nationalist literary intellectual deserves a study in itself). But though he accurately unmasks the rhetoric of centuries, many Irish voices, North and South, today join in more complicated debate than civilian slanging barbarian. The pamphlet's subtext is again Catholic grievance in the North, the rightly hurt pride of second-class citizenship, of slighted civilisation, translated into historical terms that purport to complete the whole pic- ture. Deane ends with a wild generalisation. 'Of all the blighting distinctions which govern our res- ponses and limit our imaginations at the moment, none is more potent than this four-hundred-year- old distinction between barbarians and civilians'.35 He acknowledges but does not unmask the rhetoric of Republicanism itself, the blighted seed of 'Mac Donagh's bony thumb'. Deane's polarised vista of endlessly 'competing dis- courses'6 - rival propagandas? - frighteningly rules out any objective language of fact or value. Civilians and Barbarians accepts, what Spain por- tended for Orwell, that 'the very concept of ob- jective truth is fading out of the world'. Struct- uralist relativism supports ideological absolutism. But the 'competing discourses' that really count are still to be found where Louis MacNeice found them - without benefit of structuralism: And one read black where the other read white, his hope The other man's damnation: Up the Rebels, To Hell with the Pope, And God Save - as you prefer - the King or Ireland .38 Deane, Paulin and Friel (in Heaney's wake) are highly conscious of the political role of language. They rebel against name-calling and name-chang- ing. Paulin's pamphlet A New Look at the Lang- uage Question begins: 'The history of a language is often a story of possession and dispossession, territorial struggle and the establishment or imposition of a culture.'39 Yet Field Day's resist- ance to linguistic colonialism (which logically requires the revival of Irish) must remain even more of a rearguard action than the liberation - struggles of Feminist and working-class writers. Meanwhile, their ability to use the English language contradicts their inclination to abuse it. Friel's clever device in Translations of making the audience believe that English is Irish may imply more irrevocable loss than he intended. At the period of the Irish Literary Revival it seemed at least conceivable that a 'Battle of Two Civilis- ations' might result in victory for the Gaelic League and the Irish language. But although 'Irish Ireland' won the social and political battle in the Republic, it lost the language battle, making liter- ary partition and apartheid forever impossible. In default of Gaelic, Paulin opts for local English speech as the linguistic arm of his new Res Publica: Many words which now appear simply gnarled, or which "make strange" or seem opaque to most readers would be released into the shaped flow of a new public lang- uage. Thus in Ireland there would exist three fully-fledged languages - Irish, Ulster Scots and Irish English. Irish and Ulster Scots would be preserved and nour- ished, while Irish English would be a form of modern English which draws on Irish, the Yola and Fingallian dialects, Ulster Scots, Elizabethan English, Hiberno-English, British English and American English. A confident concept of Irish English would substantially increase the vocabulary and this would in- vigorate the written language. A language that lives lithely on the tongue ought to be capable of becoming the flexible written instrument of a complete cultural idea.40 In fact since Yeats, such an idea, shorn of Paulin's totalitarianism, has informed the practice of the 30</page><page sequence="6">best poets. Nor can Ulster Scots, either for conver- sational or literary purposes, be cordoned off in some linguistic zoo - park as a backward species whose robust primitivism may one day contribute to the national bloodstock. The natural spectrum of Seamus Heaney's vocabulary shows the way that Paulin would harshly floodlight with academy or dictionary. Moreover, Paulin has invented a new form of poetic diction by sprinkling his poems with dialect, or would-be dialect, words 'like the raisins that will get burnt on an ill-made cake;'41 scuffy, choggy, glooby, claggy, biffy, keeks, glup, boke. If that's meant to be Ulster Scots idiom, the implications are almost racist. A poet's language derives from how he talks and what he hears: 'Only when a word has become necessary to him can a man use it safely; if he try to impress words by force on a sudden occasion, they will either perish of his violence or betray him'.42 Even Synge went a bit far in the matter of idiom- atic vitamin-injections. And prose-writers, par- ticularising character and scene, can perhaps do more than poets to preserve local words. Lallans poetry, in the mouth of Hugh MacDiarmid, was virtually a one-man show. Paulin creates division where unities already exist. And his own writing proves that excessive awareness of linguistic difference, of 'competing discourses', the loss of creative innocence once language is comprehended as political, can damage your style. Propaganda breeds antithesis: black- and-white readings, black-and-white writings. Thus structures the past as two 'symbolic' cathedrals, the present as 'the new security barracks, and, con- fronting them, the new and increasingly violent housing estates'.43 He sees civilians and bar- barians, cops and robbers, wherever he goes no in-betweeners. The same polarity shapes 'The Longing for Modernity', his editorial in the Winter 1982 issue of Threshold. Here 'modernity' replaces 'humanism' as the wolf in sheep's clothing eager to devour that harmless lamb, atavism. Respond- ing to the secular assault on religion (mainly Catholic, since he insults Irish Protestantism as 'essentially a negative religion, more accurately defined as being anti-catholic on principle than anything else'), Deane offers 'an equally polemical account of modernism and its triumph in a cen- tury of almost unbroken disasters . . . global war, threat of holocaust, concentration camps, wastelands, alienation, cancer, bureaucracy, mock- religious cults, crime waves, propaganda, the creation of plenty by the starvation of millions - and so on. Rationality, it appears, needs no encouragement to compete with atavism in the production of misery'. 44 Polemical indeed! Did rationality or atavism, in its nationalist guise, set up the concentration camps? Rationalised atavism, perhaps. Deane's own atavised rationalism betrays more clearly than usual the strains of reconciling Derry with Derrida. Even Heaney (in prose) occas- ionally succumbs to easy and false antithesis: far from the elegances of Oscar Wilde and the profundities of Shakespeare. I was acting with the Bellaghy Dramatic Society in plays about 1798, now playing a United Irish- man . - . now playing Robert Emmet ... Far from discussing the Victorian loss of faith, I was driving my mother to evening devotions in the "chapel" . . . Far from the melodies of courtly love, I was acting as fear a tigh at the GAA ceilidh ...45 Since Heaney, Deane and Paulin no longer live in Northern Ireland, it may be inevitable that they should fall into the tropes of stylised retrospect. All this antithesis yearns for Edenic oneness (as opposed to pluralistic 'fusion'), a monolithic nation. Southerners too may contract the rhetorical habit. For instance, an unnecessary opposition (to which Deane has contributed) in current literary-political debate, is that between Yeats and Joyce. Declan Kiberd's lecture 'Invent- ing Irelands' once again exemplifies the desire for a literary signpost with one arm, for a clear mythic lead. He oddly bolsters his (welcome) call for socialist perspectives by aligning Yeats with de Valera, and 'the mystical, conservative and rural'; Joyce with Connolly and 'the Protestant!, Socialist and Cosmopolitan'. Neither literary nor historical analysis would support the extraction of such simple ideological juice from complex oeuvres and circumstances. The mutual creative awareness between Yeats and Joyce, the extent to which Joyce's own development was shaped by a form of sibling - differentiation, prove that we need them both - as writers, as poet and prosewriter. Kiberd in fact conscripts Yeats and Joyce into an updated version of the fifties cultural argument that Ireland is European. Perhaps, but not yet. The false optimism of the fifties rested on the premise that - whether as modernist or atavist or both - you can write off Ireland's Anglo-Irish past and Northern Ireland's Protestant present. Southern poets today - Paul Durcan, and Brendan Kennelly in Cromwell - understand unresolved cultural trauma better than the intellectuals, themselves traumatised if unable to celebrate Joyce without stigmatising England's 'long decline into pro- vincialism'.47 Due to an unfortunate error on the part of 'history', Northern Irish poetry of the sixties (including Heaney's) emerged in close prox- 31</page><page sequence="7">imity to English modes. This foresighted approp- riation by perfide Albion may explain the low commitment - count that today exasperates Deane and Paulin, neither of whom can abide 'botanisers among the hedges'. Deane's 1975 essay 'Irish Poetry and Irish Nationalism' outlines a position which he has never essentially altered: 'Northern Ireland is in political crisis and Northern poets seem more remote from it than any other group, even when they are not writing poetry - which in some cases is seldom.'48 His inter- view with Heaney tries to lick him into political shape, and introduces another false polarity - between form and content: 'Do you think that if some political stance is not adopted by you and the Northern poets at large, this refusal might lead to a dangerous strengthening of the autonomy of poetry and corroborate the recent English notion of the happy limitations of a "well made poem"?49 Similarly, Paulin's 'A Nation, Yet Again' attacks most Northern poetry as frivolously irrelevant: 'That kitsch lumber-room is stacked/ with a parnassian dialect'. Reviewing Liberty Tree, Deane quotes the poem as 'a good epigraph for "northern" poetry of the last twenty years'.50 Presumably the opposite of 'a kitsch lumber-room' is an earnest seminar: Action is solid: this one day in March a hijacked saloon smacks a dozen rounds into the Bunch of Grapes and in Desertmartin men in lockram masks and dark glasses dig down through sandy soil to a bristling dump of lumpy kapok, cortex fuse and green jerricans.. . and the dunchered skip of the Clyde Valley slips a short to an invisible quartermaster in the Klondike and a van waits, waits at the corner of Atlantic and Baltic avenues all to no purpose, yet affecting a cause like a stubbed toe, a cracked axle or a backfiring old banger for these acts must come back as syntax, as grammar and a temporal fiction. This, from Paulin's 'Martello', obviously prides itself on getting down to the 'solid' nitty-gritty. A prosaic history lesson, underlining Protestant militarism since 1912 as particularly ugly and pointless, concludes with a structuralist moral. Academic language - 'parnassian dialect'? - es- pecially literary-critical terminology pervades Liberty Tree: epic, autarkic, baroque, 'pure narr- ative', phonic, classic. Deane's review finds Paulin's counterpoint between 'stage-Ulsterism' and 'a kind of academic surrealism' 'ironic'. It seems to me deeply affected and patronising: a talking-down to people whose own talk ('dunchered') he appropriates in order to despise them. Paulin's version of two-language theory epitomises how politics abuses poetry: by an in- tellectual bullying of subject-matter, by exploit- ation akin to that the poet deplores. Another bully, the structuralist levelling-word 'discourse' (much favoured by Deane and Crane Bag) fits Paulin's approach. 'Discourse' abolishes any boundary between poetry and prose, poetry and politics, in the same spirit as 'comrade' abolishes class-distinctions. The only casualty is imagination. Louis MacNeice in the thirties saw off the All-Poetry - is - Propaganda brigade of that time, when he said: The propagandist is consciously and solely concerned with converting people to a cause or creed. If Homer, Virgil, Shakes- peare, or Milton meant to do this, they were thoroughly bad propagandists.51 Republicanism fuses with structuralism as readily as does Marxism, due to similar faith in a historic destiny. Literature unproductive of that destiny, that neither wills it nor bends to its will, is disregarded as marginal 'botany'. (MacNeice points out the inconsistency between the revolutionary's determinism and his determination, the 'crateloads of pamphlets and polemics'.)52 Fiction and drama survive reductiveness and their own messages, better than poetry, which loses everything if it becomes a telegram. In fact Deane's latest collection of poems, History Lessons, inter- prets its title more personally than Liberty Tree, although the melancholia of the Derry exile structures poetic emotion no less than prose thought: But for us it was always a street Hissing with rain, a ditch running Svelte with filth, mouths crabbed With rancour and wrong, the smooth Almond of speech burnt. And the Cropped hair of children with lice ... However, Deane's longest poem, 'Christmas at Beaconsfield', is indistinguishable from Paulin's politico-historical discourse (compare the anony- mous unanimity of Young Ireland's verse): Beaconsfield. The snottish son dead. 32</page><page sequence="8">Europe awash. Ireland in her Customary decline. Omens. Poetic telegrams often resort to telegraphese and inert collage. We chiefly learn that Deane dislikes Edmund Burke, who is in any case on the losing side of history. Paulin dislikes him too. His poem 'And Where Do You Stand on the National Question?' assures a member of the Stormont establishment: 'You don't have to fall back/on Burke and the Cruiser,/on a batty style/and slack o' whoozy emotion'. This itself hardly achieves the 'classic and secular' form of which Paulin earlier dreams. Perhaps Paulin and Deane are simply re- versing Yeats's 'haughtier-headed Burke' coin. Yet when Yeats welcomes Burke to the tower of his poetry, or celebrates - creates 'The people of Burke and of Grattan' in a memorable rhythm, he subjects history to his imagination rather than the other way around. And indeed both references occur in contexts where 'I declare' prefaces an announcement of artistic 'faith' (to which many ingredients contribute) rather than of political attitude: 'Bound neither to Cause nor to State'. In any case Deane and Paulin, for all their scholarly airs, are no less historically selective than Yeats, and for different reasons. In a curious way Field Day itself has enacted the process whereby political fixity shuts off imaginative possibility, the ideological tail wags the creative dog. The originality of Heaney's Wintering Out has been cannibalised into increasingly sterile slogans. 3 After 1939 Louis MacNeice wrote: If the war made nonsense of Yeats's poetry and of all works that are called "escapist", it also made nonsense of poetry that pro- fesses to be "realist". My friends had been writing for years about guns and frontiers and factories, about the "facts" of psy- chology, politics, science, economics, but the fact of war made their writing seem as remote as the pleasure dome in Xanadu. For war spares neither the poetry of Xanadu nor the poetry of pylons. Since 1969 all Northern Irish poetry has shared the same bunker. Thus what Derek Mahon calls 'an edd of semantic scruple/In an unstructurable sea' 4 might as well concentrate on 'semantic scruple'. Nevertheless MacNeice, knowing Yeats and Ireland, did not follow Auden into his post- Marxist conviction that 'poetry makes nothing happen': 'The fallacy lies in thinking that it is the function of art to make things happen and that the effect of art upon actions is something either direct or calculable'.55 Yet Auden's own phrase in the Yeats elegy - 'A way of happening' - defines the only social and political role avail- able to poetry as poetry. In my view the emer- gence of something recognised and recognisable as 'Ulster poetry' out of the experience of the North - from 'that once birdless if still benighted pro- vince'56 - marks an irreversible shift of sensibility, if slow as a glacier. Now the term 'Ulster' or 'Northern Irish' poetry may itself bring me into conflict with a third Field Day pamphlet, Heaney's Open Letter, in which he objects to the ethno-political heading under which his poems appear in The Penguin Book of Contemporary British Poetry. Eavan Boland's Irish Times review queries the necessity for a statement so mild ('Don't be surprised/If I demur'), and so unlike the polemics of Deane and Paulin, that it seems to realise its own superflousness: 'Poetry is defined by its energies and its eloquence, not by the pass- port of the poet or the editor; or the name of the nationality. That way lie all the categories, the sep- arations the censorships that poetry exists to dispel'.5 Nobody doubts Heaney's Irishness. But his or Field Day's exclusive insistence, like the triumphalism which wants Londonderry to oblit- erate Derry and now vice versa, denies other con- texts which his poetry nourishes and which nourish it. Ulster poets have been appearing for years in anthologies of English, Irish and British poetry. The confusion is perhaps more accurate than any attempt to tidy it up. (Frank Ormsby succeeded with the elegant diplomacy of Poets from the North of Ireland, itself a history- making anthology). That notorious Penguin gen- erously represents no less than five Northerners besides Heaney, to the point where English poets complain of colonisation. And younger poets in both England and the South of Ireland look North, not only to Heaney. On the other hand, the historian A.T.Q. Stewart tried in a TV talk to familiarise and normalise Belfast for British viewers, by informing them that 'Philip Larkin wrote many of his early poems there'. This does not make Belfast Hull. Larkin's retrospect begins: 'Lonely in Ireland, since it was not home', and re- fers to 'The salt rebuff of speech,/Insisting so on difference'.5A Yet like Mahon, just then starting to write, his voice flavoured by that speech, Larkin owes a profound debt to Yeats. None of the lines of creative energy run straight. Nor do they run straight within Ulster itself. Zig-zags of energy are not picked up by receiving apparatus tuned to 'two traditions'. Ulster peo- ple hug wonderfully 'fossilised' versions of their 33</page><page sequence="9">own or someone else's Irishness/Britishness; which retards newer definition in the Republic and Britain. Yet one of the junctures where the North may harbour a cultural vanguard as well as a rear- guard is the point where traditions meet and fuse in poetry. Early in the 1960s, not for the first time though more intensely than before, political confrontation - as during the Anglo-Irish Revival - turned into cultural encounter. Contraries no longer found in the South became progressive instead of regressive, even adumbrated genuine unity. Within that space, for instance, the 'slightly aggravated young Catholic male' in Seamus Heaney was submerged by his urge to express 'the private county Derry childhood part of myself'.59 Besides the local Muse, Heaney's early influences include Robert Frost, Patrick Kavanagh, Ted Hughes, and the stimulus of his Belfast contem- poraries. His poetic landscape receives a particular assent from all kinds of Ulster readers as an auth- entic common ground; almost, despite sub- terranean tensions, as a de facto imaginative re- cognition of the whole terrain. Although Heaney saw himself as 'politicizing' Mossbawn in Wintering Out (1972), he still respects dialect more than dialectic. 'The Other Side' characterises the dis- tances between Catholic speaker and Protestant farmer in simultaneous terms of land, religion and language: For days we would rehearse each patriarchal dictum: Lazarus, the Pharaoh, Solomon And David and Goliath rolled magnificently, like loads of hay too big for our small lanes, or faltered on a rut - 'Your side of the house, I believe, hardly rule by the book at all.' His brain was a whitewashed kitchen hung with texts, swept tidy as the body o' the kirk. The point of the poem is Heaney's imaginative entry into the mind and idiom of the other side, into the 'other', beyond psychic hinterlands, across psychic frontiers. 'Rehearse' suggests how childhood mimicry (an articulation of the peculiar Northern intimacy, commoner in rural areas, that knows if not loves its neighbour) has nurtured the poet's ear and negative capability. Although the poem does not minimise difference, its cultural vision, much more humanly sedimented than the coy polarity between Wilde and Emmet, spans two languages to create a third. As throughout his work, Heaney relishes the whole heritage of Ulster English, graces with equal humorous affection Graeco-Latin 'patriarchal dictum' and Scots 'body o' the kirk'. (Contrast Paulin's autarkic boke). 'The Other Side' stresses its own language to raise the language question at another level: not as a power-struggle but as a struggle towards expression. Can there be communication, community, even communion founded on a shared landscape: Should I slip away, I wonder, or go up and touch his shoulder and talk about the weather or the price of grass-seed? This is the question before the New Ireland Forum. 'The price of grass-seed' symbolises the cost of fundamental growth and change. However, the poem itself symbolises the cross-fertilisation be- tween poets and traditions in Ulster. Language which crosses rather than takes sides is not merely the poetic wing of wet Alliance Party liberalism, of middle-class middle ground. 'The Other Side' stretches Heaney to full emotional and verbal sensitivity. I have already noticed the absence of mediating language, complicating language, in the antithetical word-worlds of Deane and Paulin. Translations too may fall short of complete human complexity, as in the rather stereotyped renderings of Irish peasant girl and English soldier, because Friel simplifies the concept of translation itself. Andrews comments on the Ordnance Survey pro- cedures presented in the play: 'the commonest is the one which gives the play its title, the method whereby the Irishman's Cnoc Ban appears on the map as the Englishman's Fair Hill'. But 'this policy was very seldom adopted by the real Ordnance Survey'.61 Towards the end of the polarised thirties Mac- Neice prefaced his Modern Poetry: The poet is a maker, not a retail trader. The writer today should be not so much the mouthpiece of a community (for then he will only tell it what it knows already) as its conscience, its critical faculty, its generous instinct. This suggests how empathy with one Ulster com- munity, such as Heaney's in North, might con- strain rather than release a poet's imagination. You can't purify the language of the tribe if you speak it. In contrast with the seductions of Dark Rosaleen, nobody can accuse Unionism of being an inspiration to poets. Protestant poets usually have no trouble getting their 'critical faculty' 34</page><page sequence="10">going. By a curious paradox this means they sometimes sing more in tune with progressive voices in the Republic than do their Northern Catholic contemporaries. The latter may be re- luctant to criticise what for them is not yet realised: the Irish nation. Thus Derek Mahon em- braces Paul Durcan: I can imagine your dismay As, cornered in some zinc cafe, You read of another hunger-strike, A postman blasted off his bike ... Oh, Holderlin no fly would hurt, Our vagabond and pilgrim spirit, Give us a ring on your way back And tell us what the nations lack!62 For Seamus Deane, the enemy without looms larger than the 'lack' within. For Seamus Heaney the umbilical cord between poet and tribe inhibits discrimination between positive and negative elements. This inhibition paralyses his imagin- ation in 'Punishment'; but a later poem, 'Casualty', resolves any ambivalence towards victims of rough justice. Identifying with one who 'broke/our tribe's complicity', the poet breaks it too.63 John Hewitt, on the other hand, has always been able - or free - now, to affirm the long human tenure of the Planters in 'Ulster clay'; now, to indict their socio-political conduct of that tenure: 'You coasted along/And all the time, though you never noticed/the old lies festered'.64 Mahon's criticism locates still deeper rottenness in the soul of the state: Bury that red bandana and stick, that banjo, this is your country, close one eye and be king. Your people await you, their heavy washing flaps for you in the housing-estates - a credulous people. God, you could do it, God help you, stand on a corner stiff with rhetoric, promising nothing under the sun. ('Ecclesiastes') Here mock-identification with the tribe operates as a satirical strategy. But although the poet rules out not only personal but literary modes of belonging ('stiff/with rhetoric'), he characteris- tically internalises the sins of his fathers. Just as empathy may be a pitfall (Heaney), so may total absence of sympathy (Paulin), since both stances preclude imaginative tension. When Mahon's poetry explicitly returns to roots, his persona acknowledges responsibility towards 'this des- perate city', 'a credulous people', 'the stricken souls/No spring can unperturb'. 'Courtyards in Delft', a recent exploration of his native ethos, links the Protestant housework ethic with the colonialist urge to 'punish nature in the name of God': I lived there as a boy and know the coal Glittering in its shed, late-afternoon Lambency informing the deal table, The ceiling cradled in a radiant spoon. I must be lying low in a room there, A strange child with a taste for verse, While my hard-nosed companions dream of war On parched veldt and fields of rain-swept gorse ... This interior, reluctantly appreciated as well as hated, says much more than Paulin's flailing at exteriors. It both defines and exemplifies the subtle posture of Mahon's poetry, not just in re- lation to Northern Irish Protestantism but to the whole world of political action. His recurrent phrase, 'through with history', finds an echo in anyone surfeited by the writings of Deane and Paulin. At once an impossible con- dition and a salutary irony, it asserts the artist's need to be 'The Last of the Fire Kings', to strike out over the fields where fireflies glow not knowing a word of the language. Mahon insists on the poet serving humanity in his own terms. He should feel, but resist, the con- trary pressure that would make him in the image of the people: 'Not to release them/From the an- cient curse/But to die their creature and be thank- ful'. Since poetry cannot be the 'creature' of politics, Unionist and Republican ideologies are equally off the map. Mahon also sloughs off the liberal-humanist socialism that MacNeice could espouse, without undue artistic compromise, dur- ing the thirties: 'What middle-class cunts we are/ To imagine for one second/That our privileged ideals/Are divine wisdom . . .' ('Afterlives'). ('Deane's dualism ignores inclusive perspectives beyond both humanism and atavism.) Similarly, Mahon intensifies MacNeice's pronouncement of a plague on all Irish houses, by conflating our con- flicts within a universally fallen world, where they are burning Witches and heretics In the boiling squares. ('The Snow Party') 35</page><page sequence="11">This tragic consciousness has an artistic integrity which refuses the consolations of either the eleg- iac (no poems for individual victims), or the Utopian. 'Matthew V' wittily eradicates human- ity's collective guilt 'until at last, offence/Was not to be found/In that silence without bound'. 'After Nerval' postulates 'the ideal society' as non- human: 'Already in a lost hub-cap is conceived/ The ideal society which will replace our own'. Those occasions on which Mahon relents thus carry more conviction than Paulin's single-minded 'solutions' ('that sweet/equal republic'). He creates socially redemptive symbols: 'a sunken city/ Sea-changed at last'; or this, which sets everyone in Ireland an educational exercise: But the hills are still the same Grey-blue above Belfast. Perhaps if I'd stayed behind And lived it bomb by bomb I might have grown up at last And learnt what it meant by home. ('Afterlives') 'Learning what is meant by home' might on one level be a pragmatic definition of 'Nationalism', a posteriori rather than a priori. The poet's humble demeanour as returning exile indicates how Mahon's strategic anarchism covers the pure politics of the poetry itself, intervenes between the heat of hatred and the light of art. While he denies the subservience of poetry to ideology or history, he also eschews the triumphalism that art itself can assume in Yeats's vision; where the poet answers the world's arrogance with his own. Less well fortified than Yeats, Mahon's poet indulges 'his/Wretched rage for order' From far his people And the fitful glare Of his high window is as Nothing to our scattered glass. (Nor would Yeats have characterised Raftery or himself as a 'grinning disc-jockey between com- mercials'.) This humility, chastened and chasten- ing, at once demythologises the poet's importance, and highlights the 'people's' plight. However, the most inward qualities of the imagination: detach- ment, patience, silence, a 'cold dream/Of a place out of time' offer sanctuary. Mahon's many var- iations on Arnoldian 'sweetness and light' also fend off the 'barbarians' - not for him, as for Deane, a propagandist slur, but all antagonists of the true civilisation his poetry models. 'Patience and silence' are qualities of the mushrooms given an unexpected lease of life in Mahon's best-known poem, 'A Disused Shed in Co. Wexford'. More anthropomorphic than his other animal, vegetable and mineral rebukes to the human, the mushrooms embody a minimal (good) will to survive: 'They lift frail heads in gravity and good faith'. This astonishingly inclusive symbol - 'Magi, moon- men,/Powdery prisoners of the old regime.., lost people of Treblinka and Pompeii' - develops from nothing, a disused shed, a detail in an Anglo- Irish novel. Part of the point is the ironic swivel to molehill rather than mountain. Small is beaut- iful; 'places where a thought might grow' - or a poem - need not steam with orthodox historical or mythic compost. 'A Disused Shed in Co. Wexford' makes and proves Edward Thomas's point, fundamental to the issue of poetry and politics, as to poetry in general: 'Anything, how- ever small, may make a poem; nothing, however great, is certain to'.65 Mahon does more than 'translate a defeated community into the narr- ative of history', or even a 'lost people' into sym- bolic salvation. (The resonance of Mahon's 'lost' stretches from bewildered, to astray to damned to doomed.) He receives a defenceless spirit into the protectorate of poetry. Since Partition, Ulster Protestant poets have erroneously been regarded as less central to the Irish experience than, say, Yeats or Beckett (both influences on Mahon). Maurice Harmon's anthology contains not one.66 However, they may be infiltrating their sensibilities by way of younger Northern poets who have inextricably pooled the genes of traditions. Paul Muldoon's poetry ex- hibits all the strengths of the hybrid. Indeed 'Mules', the title - poem of his second book, ex- plores the painful value of cross-bred ambiguity (not only in the fourth green field): We had loosed them into one field. I watched Sam Parsons and my quick father Tense for the punch below their belts, For what was neither one thing or the other. Technically, Muldoon has learned from his Ulster predecessors, as well as from international in- fluences. And heir to alienation as well as roots, he can criticise from both inside and outside the Catholic community. Heaney's richly created early world (a genuinely pre-lapsarian vision), has a boundless self-confidence which seems no longer possible without running into the barbed-wire of ideology. What is physical in Heaney becomes metaphysically problematic in Muldoon. Muldoon's latest collection, Quoof, responds to the North in a radically different - and differently radical - manner from Liberty Tree. In their very titles, disenchanted insider faces zealous 36</page><page sequence="12">convert. Paulin chooses a public Republican symbol, Muldoon 'our family word/for the hot water bottle' - another defamiliarising place 'where a thought might grow'. This thought grows where Mahon's Fire King goes, into strange territory, a strange 'language': A hotel room in New York City with a girl who spoke hardly any English, my hand on her breast like the smouldering one-off spoor of the yeti or some other shy beast that has yet to enter the language. Muldoon's 'Gathering Mushrooms' in fact exam- ines the possibility of writing committed poetry. (Unlike Paulin, he does not dismiss alternative perspectives out of hand). The poet moves from his mushroom-cultivating father caught in the attitude of an early Heaney poem: 'He'll glance back from under his peaked cap/without breaking rhythm'; to what roots, 'fifteen years on', may exact. In a magic-mushroom induced nightmare, metaphor for the transformations of violence, he finds himself ventriloquising the voice of dirty protester and hunger-striker: Come back to us. However cold and raw, your feet were always meant to negotiate terms with bare cement. Beyond this concrete wall is a wall of concrete and barbed wire. Your only hope is to come back. If sing you must, let your song tell of treading your own dung ... The poem lets this terrible duty have its say, but a Republican poet is not born. 'Aisling', too, touches on the hunger strike in its allegory of how Dark Rosaleen can damage your moral health: Was she Aurora, or the Goddess Flora, Artemidora, or Venus Bright, Or Anorexia, who left A lemon stain on my flannel sheet? Muldoon subverts martyrs and goddesses, fixed itself 'melts ander the searchlights'.67 This suggests a political posture as of escaped prisoner-of-war, Beckett). As Aidan Mathews says, the poetry itself 'melts under the searchlights'. 8 This suggests a political posture as of escaped prisoner-of-war, secret agent, double agent, saboteur. Muldoon's methods give the lie to the notion that language can operate politically in Irish poetry only by de- claring firm allegiances. Thus 'The Right Arm' handles place-names in a different spirit from some of Heaney's poems, perhaps queries that spirit: I was three-ish when I plunged my arm into the sweet-jar for the last bit of clove-rock. We kept a shop in Eglish that sold bread, milk, butter, cheese, bacon, eggs, Andrew's Liver Salts, and, until now, clove-rock. I would give my right arm to have known then how Eglish was itself wedged between ecclesia and eglise. The Eglish sky was its own stained-glass vault and my right arm was sleeved in glass that has yet to shatter. As with a Pinter-character, we distrust these innocent specifics (warned by - 'ish'), including the speaker's undue etymological passion. The ironic disproportion applied to two versions of 'church' and a 'place' that falls short of English, together with the echo of 'Rock of Ages, cleft' and 'stained-glass vault', hints at the claustrophobia of definitions. The poem's own way with lang- uage substitutes puns for etymology as a tool for uncovering meaning. Linguistic depth-charges expose latent horror in 'stained' and 'vault', in the subliminal presence of a 'shattered' right arm. 'Sleeved in glass' - another difficult midpoint like a mule - implies the precarious balance of the artist amidst potential mutilation. Bernard O'Donoghue comments: 'The tenses are discon- certing: why would I give my right arm (now) to have known "then" what is, on the face of it a fact about language?' The answer may be more than that the poem 'unmistakably, if obscurely, suggests the continuity and discontinuity of ex- perience at the same time: what is known or not, and what is believed or not'. 8 Muldoon's pro- cedures are always epistemological - and ipso facto more radical than putting old whines into new bottles. But in this case the shuttles between ignorance and 'knowledge', innocence and ex- perience, once again span fifteen uncertain years. Quoof ends with a long poem, 'The More a Man Has the More a Man Wants'. This disconcerts on a larger scale as it 'juggles' with tenses and moods, 37</page><page sequence="13">history, literary history, places and names, an anarchic version of sonnet-form, and a cosmop- olitan vocabulary. 'Obair' chimes with 'Edward Hopper', 'Derricke' with 'Durex', 'Minneapolis' with 'thrapple'. Wearing many languages lightly, Muldoon follows MacNeice and Mahon into the city, into urban demotic. After the Chandler- esque 'Immram', Red Indian 'trickster-trans- former' legend enables him to take new liberties with 'the matter of Ireland', a Joyce to Heaney's Corkery. However, Muldoon emulates Mahon in crushing any occupational or compensatory arrog- ance on the part of the artist. (Yeats and Joyce were, after all, 'last romantics'.) Like his 'hero' Gallogly, transparently a figment of the imagination, the poet himself may be: Disappearing up his own bum. Or, running on the spot with all the minor aplomb of a trick-cyclist. So thin, side-on, you could spit through him. A string of parodies insinuates that other writers also should not take themselves too seriously: Gallogly lies down in the sheugh to munch through a Beauty of Bath. He repeats himself, Bath, under his garlic-breath. Sheugh, he says. Sheugh. He is finding that first 'sh' increasingly difficult to manage. Sh-leeps. That joke at the expense of Heaney - Sweeney refuses and defuses Anglo-Irish linguistic con- frontations. Similarly Gallogly, already com- pounded of gallowglass and his pursuing alter ego, an 'Oglala Sioux', can change colour in a syllable: 'otherwise known as Golightly,/other- wise known as Ingoldsby,/otherwise known as English' - 'cultural fusion' indeed! But for all its comic versatility, the poem never loses sight of Gallogly as a terrorist on the job and on the run, as guilty party and scapegoat, prisoner of con- science and unconscious, of an aisling turned nightmare. Muldoon's sensibility reaches the parts where the hidden Ireland is usually kept hidden, where it involves suppressions as well as opp- ressions. Gallogly's trail is a trail of blood: the spoor of civil war, glimpsed here as a booby- trapped 'councillor' ('Once they collect his smithereens/he doesn't quite add up'), there as: Such is the integrity of their quarrel that she immediately took down the legally held shotgun and let him have both barrels. She had wanted only to clear the air. This passage combines two kinds of cliche: Churchill's 'the integrity of their quarrel', the media's 'legally held shotgun'. Whereas Heaney exchanges such rationalisations for the language of myth, Muldoon blows the whistle on the conspir- acy between myth and cliche. Here disproportion minimises historical cliche in order to maximise its human damage, to telescope neurosis. And Muldoon's own revitalisation of cliche ('add up', 'clear the air'), like that of the later MacNeice, finds the booby-traps in phrases. This is how poetry remakes language, wears it new, acts as midwife to a future not predicated on the past - unlike Paulin's ideal Republican dictionary or a Stuart saviour. Thus the poem's political message remains, above all, its medium. And its medium is met- amorphic - in metre, syntax, diction, and cul- tural co-ordinates. Muldoon truly discriminates between history and fiction, politics and poetry. 'The More a Man Has' could not, on the one hand, be more open about its fictional artifice; or, on the other, more coldly faithful to irreducible cruelties. Literary theorisers of 'history' either sub- stitute one politicised version for another; or dangerously devalue both intellect and imagination by claiming that all historians and poets are pro- pagandists anyway. Muldoon's metamorphoses melt or expand rigid understandings of history; make us experience history as an arbitrary kaleid- oscope, a form of mental illness; ironically insist that plus ca change. The poetry of Mahon and Muldoon signposts neither Kiltartan nor Europe, atavistic boreen nor humanistic motorway, but the path Yeats outlined as: 'every country passing out of automatism passes through demoralization, and . .. has no choice but to go on into intelligence.'S6 They have absorbed, too, Keith Douglas's demand- ing advice to a fellow-poet during the Second World War: To be sentimental or emotional now is dangerous to oneself and to others. To trust anyone or to admit any hope of a better world is criminally foolish, as foolish as it is to stop working for it. It sounds silly to say work without hope, but it can be done; it's only a form of insurance, it doesn't mean work hopelessly.70 38</page><page sequence="14">A detumescent recommendation for those who crave poetry in their politics and politics in their poetry. But good poems are exciting enough in themselves, while bad politics should remain unexciting. However, poets make their long-term contribution by refusing to betray 'semantic scruple' in a country of unscrupulous rhetoricians, where names break bones, where careless talk costs lives.
