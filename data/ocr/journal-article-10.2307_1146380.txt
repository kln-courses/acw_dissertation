<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mask Face and Machine Face Mikhail Yampolsky translated by Larry Joseph Lev Kuleshov' (1899-1970), a pioneer of Soviet cinema and film theory, wrote avidly about the training and functioning of the body of the model2 posing for the camera in great detail. Consistently taking as his starting point something of a cross between the methods of Delsarte and Dalcroze,3 Kuleshov developed his own conception about the be- havior of the actor-that ideal, mechanized, exceptionally precise being (Yampolsky 1991). This human machine, whose functioning Kuleshov in all frankness called a "mechanical process," was to expand and con- tract rhythmically, to tense and relax in accordance with the director's aims. "Just as with any living organism," wrote Kuleshov: [T]he human body has the urge to increase its space in some parts of the life process, while in others it strives to decrease it; that is to say, the human body has the ability to expand and contract. The overall line of expansion and contraction, even if occurring with interruptions in movement, is easy to trace and easy to reconstruct. A person may rise and fall with respect to the surface on which he is being filmed; he may occupy stressed and unstressed positions; in the end, his body and the entire process of motion takes place in various shifts in tension. It can manifest surges and losses of strength, which are reflected variously in the type of gesture. Fi- nally, the model must know the psychological and physiological meaning of movement and must distribute periods harmoniously. (1987:366) Quoting this paragraph, the ironic Valentin Turkin remarked, "The fact is that almost the entire 'theory' of Lev Kuleshov lies in the part con- cerning acting skill" (1925:46). To a certain extent, Turkin is right. In- deed, in Kuleshov's texts we can find practically nothing concerning any human expressive means other than those contained in the mecha- nized gesture.

The face is ultimately the part of the body that is least subject to mechaniza- tion, and in this sense, especially against the background of the Constructivist projects of Kuleshov and his adherents, it appears as a kind of archaic element falling outside the system-an obvious legacy from the "bad old days" when body movements were hopelessly unor- ganized and uncontrolled. The new cinematography in Kuleshov's esti- mation should be based on "precision in time," "precision in space," and "precision in organization." It was to be a cinematography that captured organized human and natural material (I979a:II8). The face, however, can offer no such organizational precision. It is linked with the mysticism of psychologism, which Kuleshov came out against vehe- mently and often. Kuleshov linked psychologism with the psychological drama in its being "false from beginning to end-untrue both to cin- ematography and life" (1979a: 27). Whatever the case may be, despite all the dissatisfaction with the face, it turns out to be all but impossible to get away from it. Kuleshov reluctantly resigns himself to its existence, but he points out that the face is nothing in comparison with the possibilities offered by the hands, the ideal analogs of mechanical levers. Paradoxically, the director sees a far more effective means of expression in the arms and legs than in the face: [...W]e know that the arms express literally everything: origins, character, health, profession, a person's attitude toward things; legs do almost the same thing. The face, in essence, expresses everything much less richly and vividly; it has too narrow a range, too few expressive combina- tions. (Kuleshov I987: I0) The absence of combinations and its narrow range are a denial of the face's potential precisely from the point of view of mechanics: the fore- head or eye cannot expand and contract in the same spatially dynamic range as the arm and leg. With all their inexhaustible richnesses from the point of view of body mechanics, the micro-movements of facial expressions are too insignificant to take into account. Nevertheless, the face occupies an extremely important place in Kuleshov's directing, beginning with his famous "filmless films." Some scenes are structured around an insistent focus on the faces of the ac- tors. Here, for example, is a fragment from the preliminary (film)script of the "filmless film" Vengeance (I920): 12. Face of clerk. I3. Faces of both. I4. Face of secretary. I5. An open cabinet. Clerk standing by cabinet. I6. Face of clerk. I7. Face of secretary. I8. Faces of both. (Kuleshov I979a:222) These montage sequences of faces, typical of Kuleshov, obviously con- tradict the director's avowed mistrust of the face as an expressive organ. How then does Kuleshov conceive of the face as an organ? It seems to</page><page sequence="3">62 Mikhail Yampolsky me that Kuleshov's faces can be divided into two categories. The first can be designated the "mask face" and the second the "machine face." The new cinematography in Kuleshov's estimation should be based on "precision in time," "precision in space," and "precision in organization." Let us begin with the second as the category most fully expressing the ideal of Kuleshov's conception of the body. The "machine face" is one that behaves according to the laws of the mechanized body of the model even though this behavior does not correspond to the anatomical norm for the face. It is in essence a face transformed into a "machine body." This is a face that functions according to the laws of a bodily conception alien to it, reproducing in its "narrow range" the operation of the arms and legs. Each component feature of this kind of face is transformed into an independent mechanical organ. In The Art of Film (1929), Kuleshov gives the following telling description of the function- ing of the "mask face": One must be very careful in making the transition [from working with the body] to working with the face. Cinematography will not tolerate an emphatic, crude treatment of the face; theatrical tech- niques are unacceptable for the screen because the radius of move- ments on the stage is too wide. On screen, the slightest variation of facial expression comes across as too crude and the viewer will not find that kind of acting very credible. Training of the face should be done in a series of exercises that must without fail take into account the metric and rhythmic time of the work. The face must show change through manipulation of the forehead, the eye- brows, the eyes, the nose, the cheeks, the lips, and the lower jaw. The forehead can be normal or raised; the same goes for the eye- brows. The eyes can be normal, closed, half shut, open, wide open, turned to the right, to the left, up, or down. The nose can wrinkle up, the cheeks can be puffed out or sucked in; the lips and mouth can be tight, open, half open, turned up (into a smile) or down; the lower jaw can jut forcefully forward or shift from night to left. Generally speaking, Delsarte's system is very useful in working with the face and all anatomical points of articulation, but only as an inventory of the possible variations of the human mechanism and not as an acting method. (1987:212, 214) This fragment is curious in that it starts off with a focus, standard for the cinematic thought of the time, on the crude facial movements that were taboo for the screen, but then ends with the puffed-out cheeks and the caricatured, emphatic movements of the lower jaw forward, right, and left. Strangely enough, it seems that Kuleshov did not place these grotesque mechanics in the same category as crude facial expressions. We will return to this peculiarity below. Further on, Kuleshov proposes the following "sample etude" of facial movements to the reader: I) Normal face, 2) eyes squint, move to the right, 3) pause, 4) forehead and eyebrows knit, 5) lower jaw juts forward, 6) eyes</page><page sequence="4">Mask Face and Machine Face 63 move abruptly to the right, 7) lower jaw to the left, 8) pause, 9) normal face, but with eyes still in the preceding position, io) eyes wide open while mouth half open, etc. (I987:214) What is striking in these facial calisthenics is their complete lack of psy- chological motivation. The face is split up into perfectly autonomous parts that move in accordance with the aims of the director like the parts of a machine whose task has no meaning for it. What we have here is a pure exercise in the dynamics of mechanical parts. That the "machine face" functions with no psychologically motivated goal can also be confirmed by the following: In the mechanics of the face, Kuleshov devoted particular attention to the eyes. This makes sense, since the eyes have much more mechanical freedom of movement than, for example, the nose or cheeks. The eyes are the most mechanical part of the face. As Kuleshov notes: There are many special exercises for the eyes; for example, it is very difficult for the eyes to move smoothly right and left along a horizontal line without slight jerks; in order to achieve smooth eye movement, you take a pencil in your outstretched arm and without taking your eyes off it the entire time, move it in front of you parallel to the floor. This kind of exercise will quickly train the eyes to work smoothly, which comes out much better on screen than jerky, rough movements (that is, unless they are needed for some particular reason). (1987:214) Evidently, Kuleshov attached particular importance to this technique of smooth eye movement. In 1921, he submitted a requisition for a small quantity of film in order to record his most theoretically important experiments, among which figured the "[e]ven eye movements of the model" (1979a:I34). This exercise demonstrated two crucial things for Kuleshov. First was the idea that one can transform the eye into an arm. Eye movement should not be subordinated to the task of seeing, but to that of arm movement, with which it should be coordinated.4 It appears that this transformation of the eye into a prosthetic arm of sorts was in- tended as a way of mechanizing eye movement, whose smooth shifting gave the eyes a distinctly mechanical character. Second, the smoothness of eye movement removes the eye from the process of seeing, since the jerkiness that Kuleshov eschewed is the normal operation of the eye, an operation which fixates on particular points and objects in its trajectory. The eye that moves smoothly with no jumps is the movie camera, whose movement is based on the prin- ciples of a smooth trajectory even though it ostensibly imitates the movement of the human eye. The eye is constrained by the physical world that it senses. The me- chanical smoothness of movement renders the eye sightless by not al- lowing it to come to rest on the object of vision. The eye functions as a machine working according to internal laws of mechanics that are not connected with the process of seeing or with the external world.</page><page sequence="5">64 Mikhail Yampolsky Finally, there is another crucial aspect associated with the utopia of the smoothly gliding gaze. This kind of sight does not pertain to the human anatomy, but rather belongs to the sphere of mechanical, instru- mental vision. The eye that moves smoothly with no jumps is the movie camera, whose movement is based on the principles of a smooth mechanical trajectory even though it ostensibly imitates the movement of the human eye. The human being in its mechanical aspects is trans- formed by Kuleshov into something of a movie camera. Of course, in its ideal form, the machine face remains only a theo- retical vision; however, the fundamental principles of this vision did at least achieve partial realization. In his article on the actress Alexandra Khokhlova5 (1897-1985), Viktor Shklovsky quotes the impressions of the German journalist Paul Sheffer, who remarked upon the principle of "rhythmicization of facial expressions" in the performances of Kuleshov's workshop (the "filmless films") (1926:14). Shklovsky, for his part, saw in Khokhlova's acting "a wonderful performance of the eyes, that indescribable quickness of her gaze" (I926:I5). The "quickness of her gaze" refers to the movement of the eye without jerks or stops. Kuleshov actively used this ability of Khokhlova in The Adventures of Mr. West (1924). In this film, there are entire episodes in which the fa- cial work of the actors is based on the principle of the machine face. Such is the case, for example, in the episode of Mr. West's trial, where bandits dress up as grotesque Bolsheviks and frighten West with their fantastic facial mechanics, rolling their eyes and jaws, twitching their foreheads, etc. Introduced into this episode, amidst a series of machine- like faces, is an odd, completely unmotivated shot showing the bare torso of a man sticking out and sucking in his stomach. These fantastic abdominal mechanics are essentially no different from those of the face. The face and body in this episode are operating within exactly the same paradigm and could even replace each other. The body becomes face- like and the face becomes body-like, and both are mechanical. Now let us turn to the second type of face in Kuleshov, the mask face. Unlike the machine face, the mask face has no particular descrip- tion or basis in the writings of the director. Interest in the mask face arose in Russia as early as in the teens. The apologia for the mask face in cinematography was undertaken by many theoreticians from Louis Delluc (1890-I924) to Bela Balazs (1884-1949). Delluc, who recom- mended that the actor "make himself a plaster-cast face," prescribed co- caine for this effect. "A line of cocaine creates a mask and gives the eyes a strange immobility that is to be only welcomed in film" (I985:52). The mask in film was also advocated by Kuleshov's colleague Valentin Turkin. In his book on the film actor, Turkin enumerated the classic set of actors whose skill was commonly described in terms of the mask: Charlie Chaplin, Asta Nilsen, Paul Wegener, Werner Krauss, and Conrad Veidt (I925:34-37). Kuleshov devoted a special article to Conrad Veidt, whose technique he compared to that of Asta Nilsen. He claims that Veidt's face "is con- structed according to the rules of cinematographic expressiveness": "Crooked smile, black teeth, enormous forehead with the throbbing veins of a nervous man, eyes made as if exclusively for the camera: bright, glassy, almost white" (1987:92). If mechanically smooth eye movements are the crucial element for the machine face, then with the mask face it is the eyes' immobility, whitishness, and glassiness; which is to say, the same lack of sight or blindness. The eyes are the primary factor transforming the face into</page><page sequence="6">Mask Face and Machine Face 65 that of a human being. This is related to the fact that it is precisely the eyes that are the hallmarks of subjectivity. They alone are directed out- ward from the human body and tear the body's epidermal integument as the external boundary of the organism. The eyes are a hole within the body and in external space. They are at the origin of a kind of metaphoric relationship between the body and the world. The closing of the eyes metaphorically marks the transformation of the face into an object. The mask in part is also such a face-object. In one of his important early theoretical writings, Kuleshov makes a spe- cial point of going into the relationships between the actor and the object: It is not the actor but the object that creates the greatest impres- sion. When filmed separately and edited into a series of scenes, a glove that has been forgotten in an empty hall, a flower sent to one's beloved, or a shawl or ring that has been tossed down create a highly distinct impression and through their very shape and psy- chological import are "acting" every bit as much as a model does. In other words, the significance of a model and an object in film can be equal in a skillfully edited montage. (I979a:Io7) The sightless gaze is the prime means of transforming the face into a mask-into an object, as it were. It is a way of giving the face the quality of a body, likening the face to an object and the actor to an inanimate object. Jean Epstein, who has devoted much attention to how objects ac- quire personality by exploiting the object's maximum enlargement, took a special interest in the close-up shot of the eye. "The close-up of the eye is no longer an eye; it is some eye: that is, it is the mimetic appear- ance behind which the personality of the gaze arises" (I974:I40). But precisely the maximum enlargement of the eye changes its function dras- tically by transforming the eye into an object, into a body, and tearing it from the function of sight that makes a face a face. It is no accident that Epstein does not see any fundamental difference between the close-up of an eye and that of a pistol. He remarks, "the close-up of a revolver is no longer a revolver, but rather a revolver-character" (Epstein 1974:141). The revolver-character is in essence the same as the gaze-character: some- thing embodied standing in opposition to the true nature of the gaze, which simply cannot assume a corporeal form. The birth of the concrete face is completely unrelated in Kuleshov to the idea of the manifestation on the surface of the human organism of a meaning (or soul) within [...]. Perhaps the most expressive mask face in Kuleshov appears in the fa- mous close-up experiment of Ivan Mozzhukhin (1889-1939). In order to achieve the montage effect, a masklike face for the actor was con- sciously chosen. "We chose," recalls Vsevolod Pudovkin, "the calm face that was not expressing anything" (1974:182). The unexpressive face is a mask that has not yet become a face in the true sense of the word because the generic characteristic of the face as such is precisely its ability to be expressive. In order to materialize, the expression face must first go through the mask face. Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari gave this mask face the precise label of "the abstract machine of facial</page><page sequence="7">66 Mikhail Yampolsky production" (machine abstraite de visageite) and noted that it is from this abstract machine that "concrete faces are born" (I980:207). According to Deleuze and Guattari, the abstract machine of the mask face consists in the black hole of the gaze (subjectivity) and the white wall of the fa- cial surface, serving as a kind of screen. Underlying this kind of face lies the model of film projection, with the glassy gaze of the camera eye and the white screen. Kuleshov's montage experiment in fact demon- strates how a concrete expression-face is projected onto the mask face from objects juxtaposed to the face (a bowl of soup, a dead woman, etc.). The experiment with Mozzhukhin can be described through the model of "the abstract machine of facial production," which takes the mask as its base. The materialization of the expression-face through the mask face, or, in other words, the birth of the concrete face through montage, is re- lated in Kuleshov to the process of transforming the face into a body: into an inert, inanimate object divorced from inner expressiveness. The birth of the concrete face is completely unrelated in Kuleshov to the idea of the manifestation on the surface of the human organism of a meaning (or soul) within; that is, it is not related to the classical notion of ex/pression as a squeezing of something from the inside to the out- side. "The expression," wrote Kuleshov, of a model's feeling in a scene changes (on screen, not in the pro- cess of filming) depending upon which sequence the fragment is edited into. [...A] similar law can be observed in the theatre, which, however, expresses itself in completely different ways. If we put a mask on an actor and have him assume a sad pose, then the mask, too, will express sadness; on the other hand, if the actor assumes a happy pose, then it will appear as if the mask is happy. (1979a: 160) In this argument, two things are worthy of note. First, the mask face in a montage sequence is compared to the mask on the body of an actor. Therefore, the montage environment of the close-up of an actor is trans- formed into a kind of body, or at least it functions the same way a body does. Second, the mask face takes its meaning from the body. It is as if the mask face wipes off all facial characteristics and dissolves the face into the body of which it is an extension. The mask transforms the face into a body part. The body has the same mechanical mobility of which we spoke earlier and projects the expressiveness of this mobility onto the static mask face. The face becomes an outgrowth-a body organ. Interestingly, the German actor Werner Krauss (I884-I959), working completely independently of Kuleshov, attempted to carry out the Rus- sian director's mask experiment. Karl Zuckmeyer recalls that Krauss de- spised mimetic acting and dreamt of affecting his audience with the use of masks. Once, Zuckmeyer brought Krauss a ghost mask that he had stored in his attic. Krauss put on the mask, and with the help of short monologs and gestures, evoked the distinct impression in the people present that the mask was crying or laughing (Zuckmeyer 1976:292-93). Friedrich Sieburg's 1923 article "The Magic of the Body" devoted a spe- cial fragment to the acting technique of Krauss, in which he remarked: "[t]he intensity of his [Krauss's] body is so great that when he does not have the word at his disposal as building material, all his energy is di- rected towards his body parts, where it strives to attain the purely panto- mimic magic of a face" (I984:424). Sieburg is referring to the. magic transformation of the entire body into a mask at such moments.</page><page sequence="8">Mask Face and Machine Face 67 This focus on the mask causes the body to take on the function of a face while transforming the face into a body. Urban Gad, analyzing the acting technique of Asta Nilsen (a classical actress with a mask face), makes the point that the very transformation of the face into a mask is accomplished by means of the cinematic technique of the close-up. This transformation has its logic. The camera lens, usually described as an instrument of hyper-objective vision, seems to project its force of objectification onto the face it is filming. Optics objectify the face, giv- ing it a masklike character. Gad writes: But the main thing is that film can show even the most insignifi- cant characteristic of a face or figure in a highly intensified form. The slight roundness of a foot can bend it, transforming it into a saber[;] a nose with a slight bump can come to look like a hook. The relatively large distance between the nose and the mouth is transformed in film into a veritable wasteland[;] a crooked chin can create the profile of a parrot.... One would think that inside the camera there was a lens made from Anderson's magic mirror. (1921:136) Gad here describes not merely the disappearance of the face and its be- ing covered with a mask, but also the peculiar transformation of the face into an object and even a mechanism (a saber or hook). Transforming the face into a mask is tantamount to transforming it into a mirror. This making of the mask into a mirror is tied to its high level of objectivity. It no longer reflects what is going on inside the or- ganism, but rather seems to turn its reflectivity outward. Whence its ability to reflect the meaning of body movements, but its inability to re- flect the movement of the soul. The incorporation of a mask into a montage sequence goes through the objectification of the face, through its transformation into a body whose very integument, the skin, the sur- face, is the mirror of external influences and the boundary of the outer world. Here is how Balazs describes Asta Nilsen's performance in the role of Hamlet in the episode of Hamlet's meeting with Fortinbras: Close-up of the face of Asta Nilsen. She stares at Fortinbras with- out recognizing him, with blank, uncomprehending eyes. Her lips in an absurd grimace of laughter imitate the king approaching her. The face of Fortinbras is reflected in her face as if in a mirror. It seems as if she is photographing his face, diving into its depths, and returning, and the laugh that had only been an outward im- print from the mask gradually warms from within and becomes a live facial expression. All of her art consists in this. (I982:140-41) The birth of the concrete face, just as in the experiment with Mozzhukhin, occurs through the reflection of another's body in the mask, the ab- stract machine of facial production. The quote from Balazs is interesting in that the mirrorlike quality of the mask's functioning is here described directly in terms of shooting a film. Not only does the face turn into a mask under the influence of the objective gaze of the camera, but the mask itself becomes a camera. In this case, the "blank, uncomprehend- ing eyes" that we have already encountered above have by now com- pletely and unambiguously become the camera eye, whose objectivity expresses itself through its blindness. The uninterruptedness of sight, its discreetness, definitively binds it to the objectivity of sight. Objectivity of sight is thus linked to the blindness of a machine.</page><page sequence="9">68 Mikhail Yampolsky In the teens and twenties of this century, the mask came to be more and more frequently associated with the expression of the true essence, while the face became associated with falsity. At first glance, such an approach appears paradoxical; however, behind it there is a certain logic. The mask is cognate with truth because it objectively reflects it. The mask is ontological. In I915, Carl Einstein published his book Black African Sculpture, which had an enormous influence on the Euro- pean understanding of the mask. Einstein starts off his discussion with an analysis of the tattooed body as one that has lost its personal charac- ter, thus acquiring a certain objectivity. Einstein calls tattooing the act of the body's "self-objectification." Through this act, the African brings to the fore elements of the typical within him and undergoes a transfor- mation into something else, including elements of nature-an animal, a river, etc. The mask serves this same purpose, objectifying the human being into the genus to which he belongs, or into a deity. "That is why the mask," observes Einstein, "only has a meaning when it is nonhu- man and impersonal" (1989:173). But this transformation into a genus or deity is precisely a coming closer to an essence or deeper meaning. In this context, then, the face and the personality take on the valence of falsity. Interestingly enough, in 1927 Rudolf Arnheim wrote the text "Death Masks," in which he maintained that it is precisely death masks that express the true essence of the human being, an essence hidden during life (I985:20). The mask is cognate with truth because it objectively re- flects it. The mask face as well as the machine face in Kuleshov only appear to be opposed to each other. Both militate against the expression-face, the personality-face. Both are governed by the principle of transforming the face into a body. The machine face operates according to the laws of the body, whereas the mask face, retaining its immobility, mirrors body movements. Montage essentially aids this mechanical reflectivity. The immobile mask takes on meaning only insofar as it is an extension of the moving body. Both function as metaphorical cinematic machines. Of course, such people-machines were an anthropological ideal that, as we have seen from some of the above-mentioned views, Kuleshov was not alone in holding. We are dealing here with a rather widespread vi- sion of the teens and twenties. This vision only partially affected the real, living students and colleagues of Kuleshov, whom he unhesitatingly de- scribed as a special kind of "Futuristic" "monster"; that is, people de- prived of normal faces: As one of the first workers in the film industry, Akhramovich- Ashmarin, once said, "We need unusual people[;] we need "mon- sters." "Monsters" are people who are able to train their body in light of the precise study of its mechanical construction. [...A]nd such are our young, strong, battle-hardened and "monstrous" army of mechanical people, the experimental group of students of the State Institute for Cinematography. (Kuleshov I987:90-9I)</page><page sequence="10">Mask Face and Machine Face 69 The human being without a face is the incarnation of a genus, a de- ity. This is as much a monster as an animal endowed with a face. As Michel Prieur has remarked: If an animal in its individual recognizability were identifiable by its head, causing it to stand out from the herd because of its face, it would cease to be a member of that genus in order to become a sacred animal. The sacralization of animals is accompanied by a kind of anthropomorphic facial attribution imposed on its head and giving it a teratological status with respect to its genus, whose anonymous and unidentifiable representative it would be, were it not for this fantastic transformation. (I982:3I6) The peculiarity of an animal deprived of a face consists in the fact that the natural and biological here appear generic; that is, as something part of a category or class. Wholly in the spirit of Nietzsche, the natural here appears as a mask (Granier I977). On the other hand, by rejecting the face in the name of the mask, the human being denies his connec- tion with nature and chaos, inscribing himself into the rational organ- ism of the genus, or to borrow Kuleshov's phrase, into "an army." Kuleshov's human monster, who exchanges the machine face for the mask face, has an analogy in yet another "monster" invented by Igth- century culture: the female hysteric. Hysteria is a disease discovered in the Igth century during a period of intense interest in the problems of physiognomy. The female hysteric appeared in the Igth century as a kind of mechanical human being on which the utopian fantasy of the future Constructivist supermarionettes was modelled, long before the 20th century. J.M. Charcot, who established the medical canon for di- agnosing and treating hysteria, attached particular importance to his dis- covery that one could artificially induce hysterical states through hypnosis. Charcot's public lectures, which attracted throngs of the curi- ous, were based on these artificially induced hypnotic states, which he turned into a live theatre of hysteria. One of Charcot's discoveries, made on the "mechanical" body of a hypnotized hysteric, was the abil- ity of the female patients to respond to any body position given by the doctor with a change in facial expression. The facial expressions of the hysterics changed without their conscious participation. The mask face of the hysteric was transformed into the machine face through Charcot's and his assistants' ministrations. Charcot's colleague Legrand du Saulle describes the process in the following way: The position of the limb is so closely linked by habit with the corresponding facial expression that in cataleptic sleep the majority of those muscular contractions that express our intimate thoughts are formed easily and completely automatically-all you have to do is assign the limbs the corresponding position. Thus, the patient starts to smile when you bring her fingers to her lips, the inside of her palm facing her; her face becomes men- acing when you draw her hand forward, clenched into a fist. [...A]ll these facial movements occur spontaneously without the participation of the patient's will or consciousness. We are dealing here with a completely automatic behavior [...], the patient is functioning on a subconscious level, like a living automaton, at</page><page sequence="11">70 Mikhail Yampolsky the moment when the assigned expression or movement activates the system of nerve cells responsible for that particular action. (du Saulle 1883:187-88) The hysteric in Charcot does not merely function like the classical ac- tor, whose facial expressions are usually considered to be a reflection of his inner state. She expresses passions that have nothing to do with her inner state. Her facial expressions are not those of the chaotic, dark, mystical world of the soul. The facial expressions of the hysteric are a purely mechanical, muscular reflection of body movements. She func- tions according to the principles of pure mechanics. If one takes facial expression to be the signifier, then its signified will not be the dark re- gion of the psyche, but the precise, mechanical sphere of the body di- vorced from the soul. The face definitively becomes bound up with the entire body mechanism, becoming an inalienable part of it. Such a change in the semiotic function of the facial expression also changes its mechanics. The face of the hysteric takes on more and more distinct and unnatural masklike facial expressions that can only tentatively be correlated with a given emotional state. The human being without a face is the incarnation of a genus, a deity. This is as much a monster as an animal endowed with a face. The behavior of hysterics had another essential feature. After the movement of the body part came to an end, or after the effect of electrostimulation on the facial muscles was interrupted, the patient re- tained her pseudo-expressive mask for a long time without change. Charcot called this frozen hysteric "an expressive statue" and noted that "the immobility of the poses so derived is exceptionally conducive to photographic reproduction" (in Didi-Huberman 1982:198). Charcot took considerable advantage of these favorable conditions by creating a gigantic photographic iconography of hysterics. The mask face of the hysteric is not just a screen in this case, but a living photograph, a kind of metaphorical emulsion on which the ex- pression of the face or pose was captured. The hysteric acts, in other words, as a camera. In these frozen expressive poses, the mask face and the machine face are joined together in an odd symbiosis. The face of the hysteric retains all its properties of the mask deprived of expressive- ness; that is, its staticness and emptiness with the dynamic imprint of the mechanical muscular movement of the machine face. The mechan- ics of the machine face seem here to become transformed into a series of mask phases. What we have is essentially the filming of a moving machine whose operation can be stopped at any moment. It is telling that Kuleshov should have begun regularly photographing his models in I922. Khokhlova recalls that "[at] that time Kuleshov be- gan taking pictures of the workshop actors at his home. He photo- graphed us in various etudes, from various angles, and in different kinds of lighting. An album of these photos was put together. He called it 'the workshop catalogue,' showing the range of our acting capabilities" (I979:I50). Among the photographs of the models, a considerable amount of space is devoted to the depiction of grimaces, facial move-</page><page sequence="12">Mask Face and Machine Face 71 ments exaggerated to the point of the grotesque. These photographs should not be seen as the traditional presentation of an actor in a role while highlighting facial expressiveness. Instead, we have before us the "expressive statues" of Charcot, showing the peak phases of facial me- chanics and the capabilities of the face's muscular mechanism. In spite of corrections and differences, the iconography of Kuleshov's models is of a similar order to the iconography of Charcot's hysterics. This should not come as a surprise: underlying the photographs of the French psychiatrist and the Soviet director is a largely similar ideology. Such a conclusion may seem more than paradoxical, since the new man of the Soviet utopia was a hyper-rational being capable of total conscious control over his behavior, whereas the hysteric is nothing more than an unconscious automaton controlled from the outside. But this opposition in fact turns out to be much less crucial than appears at first glance. The hyper-rationalization of the Constructivist man is accomplished through the elimination of the dark psychic entity called "the soul." Thus, behav- ior is completely divorced from chance and unpredictability since both are associated with psychological mysticism. The new man of the Soviet utopia, in essence, is expected to control himself as if he were another person, and in doing so, transforms his body into the puppet of his intel- lect. When this occurs, intellect, divorced now from "soul," assumes a somewhat impersonal character: it becomes the intellect of "the other." Oddly enough, the actor seems to combine both the will of the doctor and the body of the patient, since both the intellect and the body of the actor are the intellect and body of the other. The Constructivist principle of not trusting the "soul" and equating the body with a mechanism is-in an unexpected way-reminiscent of certain types of psychosis that began to attract the attention of psychia- trists and psychoanalysts at the end of the Igth and beginning of the 20th centuries. It is as if psychoanalysis was discovering the Constructivist man in the paranoiac and schizophrenic almost simulta- neously with the theorists and practitioners of art. In their early Studies on Hysteria (I895), Sigmund Freud and Josef Breuer had already described the etiology of hysteria through the meta- phor of "a foreign body which long after its entry must continue to be regarded as an agent still at work" (Freud and Breuer I966:40). The mechanics of hysteria are described here as penetration by "a foreign body"; that is, by an alienated bodily presence. The mask face of the hysteric is not just a screen [...] but a living photograph, a kind of metaphorical emulsion on which the expression of the face or pose was captured. The hysteric acts, in other words, as a camera. In 1911, Freud turned to the analysis of the famous case of Daniel Paul Schreber, a paranoiac who thought that God, through the help of nerves/wires/rays, was depriving him of his will and controlling his ac- tions. God's wires/rays were turning Schreber into a kind of machine. This "influencing machine" of the schizophrenic became the object of special study in the I919 essay of a student of Freud's, Viktor Tausk, precisely when Kuleshov was actively setting about his work. Tausk de-</page><page sequence="13">72 Mikhail Yampolsky scribed cases of schizophrenia in which patients thought that some kind of machine was influencing them, depriving them of their will and transforming them into mechanical dolls. But perhaps most striking in Tausk's essay is that the "influencing machine" is described in terms of the cinematograph: [T]he machine is generally a magic lantern or cinematograph. [...] It produces, as well as removes, thoughts and feelings by means of waves or rays or mysterious forces which the patient's knowledge of physics is inadequate to explain. In such cases, the machine is often called a "suggestion-apparatus." Its construction cannot be explained, but its function consists in the transmission or "draining off' of thoughts and feelings [...]. It produces motor phenomena in the body. (Tausk 1948:54-55) The bodies that are subjected to the effects of the "influencing ma- chine" themselves become similar to that machine; they become simu- lators of the machine. We conclude that Tausk's schizophrenic machine seen as a cinematograph actually had an effect on the body. The ma- chine face and mask face of Kuleshov's models quite unexpectedly re- produce the operation of the cinematograph in their behaving like a screen and camera. Charcot's hysteric is transformed into a photosensi- tive plate. The neurotic, as well as the Constructivist actor, turns out to be in the sphere of influence of the "influencing machine" of the cinematograph. The invention of film, hysteria, and psychoanalysis de- veloped a new anthropological myth that, once enriched by new aes- thetic ideas, became Kuleshov's vision of the mechanical "monster." Notes i. Lev Kuleshov is recognized as one of the first artists who became conscious of the importance of montage. He extensively explored the creative potential of montage and discovered the so-called "Kuleshov effect," i.e., the change of the meaning of an image resulting from its juxtaposition with another image. The most informative book on Kuleshov is probably Kouleshov et les siens (I990; ed- ited by Francois Albera). Two collections of Kuleshov's essays were published in English (Kuleshov 1974; Kuleshov I979b), as well as a collection of recent essays on "the Kuleshov effect" (Kuleshov 1987). 2. Kuleshov opposed model (naturshchik) to the actor, stressing that the model doesn't use psychological acting and that his work is closer to the work of a model in painting than to the work of an actor in movies or in theater. In spite of the eccentricity of such vocabulary, we will follow Kuleshov in his use of this word. 3. For the methodology of Delsarte, see Genevieve Stebbins' Delsarte System of Ex- pression (New York: Dance Horizons, 1977); for Dalcroze see Irwin Spector's Rhythm and Life: The Work of Emile Jacques-Dalcroze (Stuyvesant, NY: Pendragon Press, 1990). 4. Richard Schechner in a letter to the author suggested that the striking parallel exists between Kuleshov's observations of eye/arm relation and Indian classical dance injunction (with reference to mudras, or hand movements). Schechner also noticed strong correspondences with a technique of a Beijing opera per- former, as exemplified in the work of the famous Mei Langfang. As far as we know, Kuleshov himself never mentions such parallels and never thought about his project in terms of oriental poetics. Indian and Chinese performances strongly influenced Sergei Eisenstein, who wrote an excited analysis of Mei Langfang's work in 1935, anticipating the first tour of the Chinese actor in the USSR. Later Eisenstein elaborated his own technique of the eye's movements</page><page sequence="14">Mask Face and Machine Face 73 (very expressive in Ivan the Terrible, 1945) consciously using elements of oriental theater. 5. Khokhlova was one of Kuleshov's first pupils; later, she became his wife and the star of many of Kuleshov's films. After I929, she directed some films herself.
