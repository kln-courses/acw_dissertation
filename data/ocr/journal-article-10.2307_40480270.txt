Ihese two books by the psychologist and prolinc writer on Frida Kahlo, Salomon Grimberg, add to our knowledge of the artist, although his analysis is limited by a biographical orientation that overlooks the social dimensions of her work. Song of Herself features hitherto unpublished texts from interviews conducted in !949~5O by a psychology student Olga Campos, in THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE • CLI • JULY 2OO9 4^5 BOOKS</page><page sequence="2">which Kahlo's idiosyncratic and expressive voice illumi- nates many aspects of her life and art. Obsessively attract- ed to a popular and charismatic gay classmate, Kahlo posed as his girlfriend, an experience that exacerbated her emotional insecurity. On the basis of these texts, Grimberg - perhaps too credulously - redates a number of paintings and posits the existence of several others. As he points out, the first page of Kahlo's narrative contains four factual errors, three of which are deliberate. Grim- berg also reproduces several remarkable, Surrealist- inspired drawings, but does not comment on them. In The Still Ufes, Grimberg compares Kahlo's work to 'pages in a diary' and argues that individual components represent Kahlo and members of her circle. Kahlo is the rejected cut rose in one painting, while the two male members of her high-school triangle are still on the vine. Grimberg reasonably relates a doll bride to Jacqueline Lamba in The bride who becomes frightened at seeing life open (1943), but his other identifications are untenable: David Hare (Lamba's lover) is a katydid (cricket) and André Breton (Lamba's husband) is the owl who would devour it. Grimberg overlooks the katydid's Surreal communi- cation with an anthropomorphic coconut. Nor does he discuss the spatial distortions, compressions and massing of the fruits which reflect the innovations of Cézanne and Picasso, mediated by Rivera. The suggestive slit in the papaya is a heightened sexual element that - along with the title - confirms the painting as an allegory of marital defloration, with the diminutive bride peering over a melon wedge as the butt of the joke. The pearls in her hair and the watermelon seeds are emblems of fer- tility that relate to drops of water, milk, blood and semen in other works by Kahlo. Grimberg also identifies Hare as a katydid in The chick (1945), with cameos by two 'venomous' spiders that putatively represent his wife and mother-in-law. This mushroom cloud-shaped still life is clearly a commentary on war. Grimberg's extensive iconographie research (mostly from handbooks, not all of exemplary scholarship) is applied too mechanically. His interpretations are frequently over-reaching. He posits sources for Kahlo's paintings in several old-master works, but establishes no plausible connections to them. In Kahlo's work, roots, vines, tendrils, coconut hairs, lightning and sunrays function as formal and symbolic equivalences in a pantheistic celebration of the duality of life and death, played out in an artistic repertory that simultaneously refers to various mystical and anti-rational currents, from Mexico (Pre-Columbian, Catholic, folk), the European avant-garde (Symbolism to Surrealism), ancient Egypt and Asia. Surrealism was an especially vital force in Kahlo's art. Her semi-naive tech- nique and the dominance of biographical and nationalist readings have masked the work's full complexity. RUBEN C.
