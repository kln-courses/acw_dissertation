Introduction Touring the holiday break following a grueling fall semester, I drove past my high school alma mater and was disappointed to observe a freestanding, silhouette-style display depicting the Nativity, well-lit for nighttime passers-by. The display stood sev- eral feet tall and was placed directly in front of the public school on the part of the premises bordering a major state highway. The message seemed clear: This public school, indeed this entire commu- nity, celebrates the holiday season in one particular way - namely, by recalling the biblical account of Jesus 's birth. As a resolutely nonreli- gious person, I was at least annoyed, if not offended. Of course, I was not terrorized by the prospect of my former high school prin- cipal or superintendent tracking me down to force me to read the New Testament Gospels. And, although I gave some thought to it, I did not even bemoan my evidently deficient status in a political community whose "valid" participants happily support such pronouncements of normative religious beliefs by govern- ment institutions - at least when such pronouncements com- port well with their own world-view. Rather, I simply thought, "Given that I have driven past dozens of similar displays on pri- vate lawns and a local private school, what possible interest could my publicly funded former high school have in displaying a cr√®che during the holiday season?" There is little doubt that the interest is patently religious. The school district has determined not merely to promote a religious Todd Reutzel is a recent graduate of the University of Tennessee College of Law, where he served as Executive Editor of the Tennessee Law Review.

Even more narrowly, many informed and intellectu- ally honest Christians are aware of the fact that the story of the birth of Jesus - present only in the post-Pauline accounts of Matthew and Luke - is almost surely a relatively late story patched into the rapidly expanding and embellished accounts of Jesus's "life."1 This historical note is important, for it would be apparent to an informed and reasonable observer that this public school encourages observance of the holiday season in conform- ity with the norms promulgated largely by evangelical Christians, who represent the most influential strand of the Christian tradi- tion still clinging to the birth narrative as a literal, historical account. But what I perceived as an unconstitutional religious agenda, many would perceive as an acceptable "acknowledgment" of re- ligion. Indeed, many Christians, predominantly those of a funda- mentalist or evangelical bent, perceive their belief system and the basic constitutional principle of free exercise of religion to be under attack in light of the gradual removal of religious symbols from government property (if indeed the number of such dis- plays really is diminishing at all). In late 2003, after a federal court ordered removal of a Ten Commandments monument from a state courthouse in Montgomery, Alabama, Judge Roy Moore, who directed the placement of the monument in the state judicial building, declared, "It is a sad day in our country when the moral foundation of our law and the acknowledgment of God ha [ve] to be hidden from public view to appease a federal judge."2 A CNN report notes that "Moore and his supporters say . . . that forbidding the acknowledgment of the Judeo-Christian God violates the First Amendment's guarantee of free exercise of religion."3 Despite the fact that this comment completely miscon- strues the notion of free exercise (a point discussed below) and falsely suggests a robust link between the decalogue and Ameri- can law (also discussed below), many Americans evidently agree with Moore's remarks. A CNN- USA Today-Gallup poll affirms that 77% of over one thousand Americans interviewed disapproved of "the federal court order under which workers removed the Ten Commandments monument from the rotunda of Alabama's state judicial building."4</page><page sequence="3">These Stones Will Cry Out 405 Even more pointedly, the website of Faith and Action Minis- tries apprehensively proclaims that "[throughout the nation, secularist organizations such as the ACLU and others are system- atically working to strip the Ten Commandments from [the] public eye."5 However, the site reassures visitors that in Mont- gomery, Alabama "thousands of believers prayerfully protested the order to remove the Ten Commandments, while millions joined in prayer from their homes and churches."6 The message continues, "As Americans, we must stand for the Ten Command- ments in our towns, communities and nation!"7 The choice of language is not accidental. Such religious groups often equate being American with being Christian, and they desire for that sen- timent to become more pervasive throughout the country. The site's operators encourage visitors to submit a petition to U.S. Senators and Representatives that concludes by asserting, "Our nation is in a cultural crisis. The Ten Commandments ha [ve] be- come the defining symbol of this struggle for the soul of America, Please take action to support the Ten Commandments."8 As these examples and a wealth of other data suggest, a predominantly religious agenda lies behind the attempt to retain displays of forceful religious symbols on government property - symbols important to a hegemonic element of Christians in America who desire to have representations of their religious be- liefs bear the imprimatur of local, state, and federal government institutions. The United States Supreme Court presently has the opportunity to decree that government bodies and officials, act- ing in their official capacity as government entities, cannot par- ticipate in that agenda. On March 2 of this year (2005), the Supreme Court was scheduled to hear oral arguments related to the consolidated cases of ACLU v. McCreary County9 and Van Orden v. Perry,10 both involving displays of the Ten Command- ments on public property. While inevitably differing factually from other types of religious displays, Ten Commandments dis- plays are representative of the problems intrinsic generally to dis- plays of religious symbols on government property, and the Supreme Court possesses the opportunity to insist that a genuinely secular purpose must lie behind such displays and to clarify the muddled precedent that exists in this area of jurisprudence, much of which has been caused by the tension and incongruity</page><page sequence="4">406 SOUNDINGS Todd Reutzel between the last two Supreme Court decisions on this issue in Lynch v. Donnelly11 and County of Allegheny v. ACLJJ}2 In this essay, I will discuss the Ten Commandments displays reviewed by the Sixth and Fifth Circuit Courts in McCreary County and Van Orden as a starting point for examining a couple of criti- cal points that courts consistently overlook or underappreciate in their analysis of Ten Commandments monuments and other re- ligious displays - especially the lack of scrutiny by courts of the historical claims forwarded to support such displays. But if the Supreme Court is as recalcitrant to changing its position on mat- ters pertaining to religion as the average American, my hopes are not high that progress is on the horizon when the Court hands down its decision later this year. II. ACLU v. McCreary County In ACLUv. McCreary County, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's order requiring removal of three dis- plays of framed copies of the Ten Commandments located in the county courthouses of McCreary and Pulaski Counties in Ken- tucky and in the school classrooms of the Harlan County School District.13 Each of the displays at issue in the case had initially included only a copy of the Ten Commandments standing alone, and each had been subsequently modified to include "several ad- ditional secular historical and legal documents in their entirety" after an injunction was issued requiring the defendants to re- move the displays.14 The final version of the courthouse displays surrounded the Ten Commandments with the "Star Spangled Banner, the Decla- ration of Independence, the Mayflower Compact, the Bill of Rights, the Magna Carta, the National Motto, the Preamble to the Kentucky Constitution, . . . Lady Justice," and an explanatory description, entitled "Foundations of American Law and Govern- ment Display," stating that the "display contains documents that played a significant role in the foundation of [the American] sys- tem of law and government."15 The only substantive attempt to thematically tie the Ten Commandments to the surrounding documents involved a prefatory description asserting that [t]he Ten Commandments have profoundly influenced the forma- tion of Western legal thought and the formation of our country. That influence is clearly seen in the Declaration of Independence,</page><page sequence="5">These Stones Will Cry Out 407 which declared that, "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Lib- erty, and the pursuit of Happiness." The Ten Commandments pro- vide the moral background of the Declaration of Independence and the foundation of our legal tradition.16 The school display was largely similar, replacing Lady Justice with "an excerpt of the Congressional Record containing the Ten Commandments" and a "Kentucky statute*. . . regarding the posting of historical displays."17 The school display also added a "School Board Resolution" and "opened a forum for the commu- nity to post . . . additional historical documents" with permission of the Board.18 The Resolution stated: We believe these . . . documents positively contribute to the educa- tional foundations and moral character of students in our schools .... [I] t is our opinion that these . . . documents, taken as a whole, are valuable examples of documents that may instill qualities desir- able of the students in our schools, and have had particular histori- cal significance in the development of this country.19 A. Purpose Prong Following the Lemon framework for analyzing potential Estab- lishment Clause violations,20 the court first evaluated the govern- ment purpose behind the displays, examining "whether Defendants' inclusion of the Ten Commandments in the displays was [predominantly] a 'purposeful or surreptitious effort to ex- press some kind of subtle governmental advocacy of a particular religious message.'"21 The defendants' five stated purposes primarily involved the goal of erecting a constitutionally passable display containing the Ten Commandments in order to demonstrate their purported role in "the foundation of American Law and Government."22 The Sixth Circuit proceeded to analyze this alleged purpose chiefly under the precedent of Stone v. Graham,23 the last Su- preme Court case to confront a Ten Commandments display in a school context: "To comply with Stone, ... a purported historical display must present the Ten Commandments objectively and in- tegrate them with a secular message."24 The court noted various factors relevant to assessing this question, including the content, context, and evolution of the displays.25</page><page sequence="6">408 SOUNDINGS To√†d Reutzel 1. Content of the School Display With respect to the School Board's Resolution, the court con- cluded that the statement essentially failed to integrate themati- cally the Ten Commandments into the rest of the display to produce some type of secular "study" or message:26 The Resolution merely asserts, without further elaboration, the School Board's "belie [f]" and "opinion" that the documents, in- cluding the Ten Commandments, have educational and moral value, as well as historical significance. It is difficult to determine what subject, if any, the display even purports to study.27 The Board had attempted, however, to make such a connection by excerpting a Joint Resolution of Congress "declaring 1983 to be Tear of the Bible'" - an excerpt that referenced the Ten Commandments:28 The excerpt . . . asserts an opinion (that of a Representative) that "it would serve an educational purpose for [America's] citizens to become familiar with the important role which the Bible and Ten Commandments have played in molding our American traditions and laws." The excerpt, however, never explains the connection between the Ten Commandments and American traditions.29 Far from supporting an "objective study of the role that the Ten Commandments, or even the Bible generally, played in the foundation of the American government,"30 the quote from the Congressional Record actually "exhorts Americans to acknowl- edge the Bible as 'the Word of God' and to apply the teachings of the Bible to their lives."31 2. Content of the Courthouse Displays The court similarly found that "the courthouse displays of the Ten Commandments suffer [ed] from the same fundamental flaw - the lack of a demonstrated analytical or historical connection with the other documents":32 It is not facially apparent, and the preface [to the displays] offers no explanation, how the quotation from the Declaration of Inde- pendence is in any way connected with the Ten Commandments, which say nothing about men being created equal and with the rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The only facial similarity between the two documents is that they both recognize the existence of a deity .... [T]his solitary similarity hardly dem- onstrates how the Ten Commandments in particular influenced the writing of the Declaration and, hence, the foundation of our country and legal tradition.33</page><page sequence="7">These Stones Will Cry Out 409 In short, the court found it critically problematic that the defend- ants had not "attempted to buttress the historical claim that the prefatory document makes about the Ten Commandments' foundational role in the drafting of the Declaration of Indepen- dence."34 While the writings of the Founders, "from the Mayflower Compact to the Constitution," clearly evidence "'[t]he fact that [they] believed . . . that the unalienable rights of man were rooted in [God],'"35 the court noted, [t]here is by no means a consensus . . . that the source of Thomas Jefferson's belief in divinely-bestowed, unalienable rights, to the extent this belief inspired the writing of the Declaration, was the Ten Commandments or even the Bible.36 Indeed, the court commented, Jefferson expressed a healthy skepticism with respect to the biblical canon.37 The court cited a twentieth-century scholar to point out that "with respect to 'the political philosophy of Nature and natural rights' referenced in the Declaration that the 'lineage is direct: Jefferson copied Locke.'"38 This historical aside by the court, as I will emphasize below, is highly consequential, and the court of appeals makes at least some effort to recognize the significance of the historical ques- tion for purposes of analyzing a government body's interest in supporting a religious display: The Court's reference to historical sources is intended merely to illuminate [the] fundamental deficiencies in Defendants' argu- ment [i.e., the asserted historical connection] and to suggest that an objective [i.e., not religiously motivated] presentation of the Ten Commandments would at least take into account the abun- dant historical evidence regarding the sources that influenced the drafters of the Declaration of Independence.39 While the court certainly could not require a thorough "recount- ing of the history of the nation's founding," it envisioned at least "a display that does not go out of its way to stress the proposition that the Ten Commandments formed the foundation of the Dec- laration of Independence while utterly ignoring ... all other in- fluences."40 Thus, put simply, the court determined that the content of the displays suggested not only that their predomi- nant purpose was religious,41 but indeed that a "patently relig- ious purpose" had motivated their placement.42</page><page sequence="8">410 SOUNDINGS ToddReutzel 3. Context and Evolution of the Displays With respect to the physical context of the displays, including the size and placement of the religious symbol in relation to other components of the display, the religious symbols in the dis- plays at issue were not particularly prominent. But the court opined that "where the content of the displays otherwise indicates a predominate religious purpose, the fact that the Ten Com- mandments are not physically prominent [vis-√†-vis the secular texts or other contextual elements] is not dispositive."43 Additionally, the court emphasized that the evolution of the displays implied a religious purpose: "Defendants' conduct from the time it created the Ten Commandments displays throughout the time it modified the displays is relevant to determining their primary purpose."44 In Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe, a case in which a district policy of student-led prayer before high school football games had been modified in an attempt to adapt it to the requirements of the Establishment Clause, the Supreme Court insisted that it was not oblivious to "what every Santa Fe High School student understood] clearly - that this policy [was] about prayer"; thus, the Court "refuse [d] to turn a blind eye to the context in which this policy arose, and that context quell [ed] any doubt that this policy was implemented with the purpose of endorsing school prayer."45 Though the Circuit Court agreed with the district court's position that the history of the displays generally supported the conclusion that the defendants' purpose was religious in nature, the Sixth Circuit Court down- played the lower court's supposedly singular emphasis on the point that "the context and history of Defendants' Ten Com- mandments displays" indicated a religious objective.46 B. Endorsement Prong Because the majority based its decision solely on the fact that the predominant purpose of the displays was religious in na- ture,47 only Judge Clay explicitly advocated the portion of the opinion relating to the issue of endorsement. Under this prong of the Lemon test, Judge Clay affirmed, the basic inquiry is "'whether an objective observer, acquainted with the text, legisla- tive history, and implementation' of the displays would view them as state endorsement of religion."48</page><page sequence="9">These Stones Will Cry Out 411 Judge Clay contrasted Allegheny, in which a courthouse cr√®che was struck down as unconstitutional "because nothing in the con- text of the display detracted from the cr√®che's religious mes- sage,"49 from Lynch, in which multiple secular symbols amid a courthouse cr√®che purportedly tied the religious symbol to an overall holiday theme, resulting in a "secular link [that] over- came any religious message that [the cr√®che] might otherwise have conveyed on its own."50 In the present case, Judge Clay agreed with the district court's conclusion that "placing [the Ten Commandments] among . . . patriotic and political documents, with no other religious or moral codes of any kind," not only failed to secularize the inherently religious message of the Ten Commandments, but actually "imbue [d] [the religious symbol] with a national significance constituting endorsement."51 Judge Clay also re-emphasized the lack of any unifying secular theme evident in the displays: Ultimately, the displays convey a message of religious endorsement because of the complete lack of any analytical connection between the Ten Commandments and the other patriotic documents and symbols. A reasonable observer of the displays cannot connect the Ten Commandments with a unifying historical or cultural theme that is also secular.52 The history and location of the displays supported this conclu- sion, and the presence of the displays in public schools "en- hance [d] the underlying message of religious endorsement."53 As to the location of the courthouse displays, Judge Clay ob- served that "every display on [courthouse] property is marked implicitly with government approval."54 Thus, on this additional ground, Judge Clay found further reason to reject the displays as unconstitutional. C. Dissenting Opinion Judge Ryan's dissent reveals the fact that the tension between Lynch and Allegheny makes it possible to argue to almost any de- sired conclusion based on the unclear precedent established by the Supreme Court in those two cases, for Judge Ryan contended that the "defendants' displays comport [ed] with the require- ments of the Constitution in every respect," as "clearly" indicated by the principles established in Lynch and Allegheny.55 Indeed, contrary to the majority's equally strong but opposite conclusion, the dissent argued that "the three displays [at issue] . . . easily and</page><page sequence="10">412 SOUNDINGS To√†d Reutzel obviously pass [ed] the Lemon test," as unpacked in subsequent re- ligious-display cases.56 Discussing the secular purpose prong of Lemon, the dissent ref- erenced a rather problematic —Ä—Ç–µ-Allegheny Sixth Circuit decision to establish his basic criterion for evaluating this issue, stating that "'–´ statute or practice that is motivated in part by a relig- ious purpose may satisfy the first Lemon criterion so long as it is not motivated entirely by a purpose to advance religion."'57 On the basis of this feeble test, the dissent concluded that in the de- fendants' stated desire to "erect a display of the Ten Command- ments that is constitutional," he could find "nothing that even hint[ed] at a primarily religious purpose, much less a sham."58 The dissent proceeded further, however, contending that "there [was] no reason to doubt the legitimacy" of another pur- ported secular purpose of the displays - namely, the purpose of "recogniz[ing] the significance of the Ten Commandments in providing the moral and cultural background of the Declaration of Independence and the foundation of our legal tradition."59 This point is crucial, for it reflects the kind of specious basis often urged by proponents of Ten Commandments displays on public property who are driven by an unabashedly religious ob- jective. Judge Ryan remarked, The Declaration of Independence is not the sole source of evi- dence that religion, of which the Ten Commandments are a nearly universal symbol, was a significant influence upon the foundation of American law and government.60 As I will discuss in greater depth below, the suggestion that relig- ion played or continues to play a significant role in the develop- ment of American law is a very different claim than the proposition that the Ten Commandments played or continue to play such a role. Moreover, the unwarranted identification of re- ligion with its "nearly universal" symbol of the Ten Command- ments constitutes a connection that is patently offensive in a country as religiously and culturally diverse as the United States. Thus, the dissent's many examples from George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, the U.S. Congress, and others suggesting the importance of religion in American life misses the point.61 Initiating another point that I will discuss in more detail below, the dissent proceeded to address specifically the issue of the Ten Commandments9 purported influence on the American legal sys-</page><page sequence="11">These Stones Will Cry Out 413 tem, referencing the Fifth Circuit's decision in Van Orden, in which the court claimed a continuing influence of the Ten Com- mandments on our laws. Judge Ryan also mentioned, among other examples, the Third Circuit's decision in Freethought Society v. Chester County, in which that court announced that there was a well documented history ... to the effect that the Ten Commandments have an independent secular meaning in our so- ciety because they are regarded as a significant basis of American law and the American polity.62 As will be made clear below, though, no court's mere assertion of such an ongoing connection can overcome the clear evidence that no significant connection exists. To bolster his conclusion that the displays at issue in this case were constitutionally passable, Judge Ryan additionally pointed out that, "[i]n Lynch, the Court approved of the use of a cr√®che in a Christmas display that contained other symbols of the holi- day such as a Santa Claus house and reindeer,"63 and in Allegheny, "the defendant was able to achieve the secular purpose of recog- nizing cultural diversity merely through the context of the dis- play."64 On the basis of this precedent, Judge Ryan opined that the explanatory signs accompanying the defendants' displays, al- leging the Ten Commandments' influence on American legal thought, "succinctly describe [d] the secular purposes for the dis- plays and, under Lynch and Allegheny, [were] more than suffi- cient" to make the displays passable.65 Analyzing the endorsement prong of Lemon, Judge Ryan fur- ther elaborated on Lynch, noting Justice O'Connor's conclusion that although the cr√®che [is] an inherently religious symbol, a reasona- ble observer would not [have] viewfed] the overall display [in that case] as an endorsement of religion: "Although the religious and indeed sectarian significance of the cr√®che . . . [was] not neutral- ized by the setting, the overall holiday setting change [d] what viewers may [have] fairly understood] to be the purpose of the display - as a typical museum setting, though not neutralizing the religious content of a religious painting, negates any message of endorsement of that content."66 Moreover, the dissent urged, the city government's display in Al- legheny, despite containing a religious symbol, conveyed a secular message of recognizing different ways of celebrating the holiday season.67 Judge Ryan therefore concluded that the documents</page><page sequence="12">414 SOUNDINGS To√†d Reutzel surrounding the religious elements of the display in this case sim- ilarly created a unifying theme that was secular in nature:68 "In my judgment, no reasonable observer" would fail to recognize the overall message of the displays "that from the founding of the republic, religion was and always has been, an inherent compo- nent of the law and culture of our pluralistic society, and that saying so in the public square acknowledges religion, but does not endorse it."69 III. Van Orden v. Perry In the second of the consolidated cases taken up on certiorari by the Supreme Court, Van Orden v. Perry,70 the Fifth Circuit faced the issue of deciding the constitutionality of a monument inscribed with the Ten Commandments on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol.71 Determining that the grounds of the state capitol, which include a total of seventeen monuments, consti- tute "a protected National Historic Landmark,"72 the Ten Com- mandments monument was deemed by the court to be merely one element of that general historic landmark,73 which functions overall as "a commemorative display of significant events and strands of Texas history."74 Guided tours of the Capitol building and grounds "offer [access to] a wide array of monuments, pla- ques and seals depicting both the secular and religious history of Texas."75 Among other things, the displays include a tribute to African American legislators, a Confederate plaque, a plaque commemorating the donors of the granite for the build- ing, and a plaque commemorating the war with Mexico. There is a Six Flags Over Texas display on the floor of the Capitol Rotunda featuring the Mexican Eagle and serpent - which as visitors . . . learn, is a symbol of Aztec prophecy - together with the Confed- erate Seal containing the inscription "Deo Vindice" (God will judge) .... [Moreover, in] the Supreme Court Building, visitors [may] find inscribed above the bench the phrase "Sicut Patribus, Sit Deus Nobis" (As God was to our fathers, may He also be to us).76 The monument at issue in this case contained predominantly the text of the Ten Commandments, surrounded by various symbols including "an American eagle grasping the American flag" and a "symbol representing Christ."77 An offset box below the religious text bore the following inscription: "PRESENTED TO THE PEO- PLE AND YOUTH OF TEXAS BY THE FRATERNAL ORDER OF EAGLES OF TEXAS 1961. "78</page><page sequence="13">These Stones Will Cry Out 415 A. Introduction According to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, "[t]he guiding principle [in analyzing Establishment Clause cases] is govern- ment neutrality toward religion in the sense that a state cannot favor religion over non-religion or one religion over another."79 Yet the court somehow determined, quickly revealing its hand, that neutrality "does not demand that the state be blind to the pervasive presence of strongly held views about religion with myr- iad faiths and doctrines."80 Without explaining the basis for this apparently "obvious" or self-evident observation, the court af- firmed that [n] either government nor this Court can or should ignore the sig- nificance of the fact that a vast portion of our people believe in and worship God and that many of our legal, political and per- sonal values derive historically from religious teachings.81 Following this setup, the court's decision hardly remained in suspense. B. Purpose Analysis Analyzing the purpose prong under the Lemon framework, the court observed, "A display has the purpose of endorsing religion when it 'convey[s] or attempt[s] to convey a message that relig- ion or a particular religious belief is favored or preferred.'"82 Em- ploying reasoning that foreshadowed the dissent in McCreary County, the court concluded that nothing in the record suggested that the legislature's purported reason for erecting the monu- ment - that is, "to recognize and commend a private organiza- tion for its efforts to reduce juvenile delinquency" - was a sham, despite the plaintiff's contention that the real purpose was to "pay tribute to and honor the subject or ideal depicted," namely the Ten Commandments.83 The plaintiff had argued that the Texas legislature really intended to "endorse the decalogue as a common code of conduct and implicitly promote its religious message."84 However, the Fifth Circuit Court rejected that claim, finding that the context in which the monument is presently dis- played "negates any sense that the state is endorsing or promot- ing the decalogue's religious, as opposed to its secular, aspects."85</page><page sequence="14">416 SOUNDINGS ToddReutzel –°. Effect Analysis Evaluating the primary effect of the display at issue under the second prong of Lemon, the court assessed "whether the primary effect of the display advances . . . religion as seen from the eyes of a reasonable [informed and aware] observer."86 "[T]o determine whether it has the effect of endorsing religion [the court] ask[s] 'what viewers may fairly understand to be the purpose of the dis- play/"87 which inevitably turns on the display's context.88 Applying these principles to the case before it, the court noted the capitol's status as a National Historic Landmark and the State's contention that the monument was part of a museum-like context as factors "support [ing] the conclusion that a reasonable viewer would not see the display [in the context of the sixteen other monuments on the grounds] either as a State endorsement of the Command- ment [s'] religious message or as excluding those who would not subscribe to its religious statements."89 Furthermore, the court emphasized unsupported and unwar- ranted historical connections between the Ten Commandments and the current American legal system: Even those who would see the decalogue as wise counsel born of man's experience rather than as divinely inspired religious teach- ing cannot deny its influence upon the civil and criminal laws of this country. That extraordinary influence has been repeatedly acknowl- edged by the Supreme Court and detailed by scholars. Equally so is its influence upon ethics and the ideal of a just society.90 In this regard, the court observed the decalogue monument's placement in the midst of various houses of law in a location on the grounds that "was carefully chosen by the Board's profes- sional staff to reflect the role of the Commandments in the mak- ing of law,"91 while also taking an opportunity to lavish the faith- like praise of a devotee on the Ten Commandments: To say [that the State is merely endorsing the secular message of the decalogue] is not to diminish the reality that it is a sacred text to many, for it is also a powerful teacher of ethics, of wise counsel urging a regimen of just governance among free people. The power of that counsel is evidenced by its expression in the civil and criminal laws of the free world. No judicial decree can erase that history and its continuing influence on our laws - there is no escape from its secular and religious character. There is no consti- tutional right to be free of government endorsement of its own laws. Certainly, we disserve no constitutional principle by conclud-</page><page sequence="15">These Stones Will Cry Out 41 7 ing that a State's display of the decalogue in a manner that honors its secular strength is not inevitably an impermissible endorsement of its religious message in the eyes of our reasonable observer.92 The court also noted in this context, ironically I think, that "[h]istory matters here," referring to the length of time the mon- ument had been in place. The court cited the reasoning of a Third Circuit case, which it deemed applicable to the present case: '"The reasonable observer, knowing the age of the . . . [re- ligious symbol displayed] , would regard the decision to leave it in place as motivated, in significant part, by the desire to preserve a longstanding plaque (.'"93 Apparently for this court, long use moder- ates what otherwise might be a constitutional violation. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ultimately concluded that "Texas does not violate the First Amendment by retaining a forty- two-year-old display of the decalogue."94 As if anticipating a Su- preme Court decision on the matter, the court closed its opinion by reminding readers that even the building that houses our na- tion's highest Court bears images of the decalogue: A display of Moses with the Ten Commandments such as the one located in the United States Supreme Court building makes a plain statement about the decalogue's divine origin. Yet in context even that message does not drown its secular message. So it is here.95 IV. The Historical Question: A Primer on the Ten Commandments The dissent in McCreary County criticized the majority for not accepting the defendants' alleged purpose of demonstrating a historical connection between the decalogue and American law. Because the claim of such a connection is so pervasive in Ten Commandments display cases, this issue of a historical link is cru- cial to assessing the real purpose behind such government dis- plays. The majority in McCreary County stressed that the defendants had thoroughly failed - and had not really even at- tempted - to establish some historical link between the deca- logue and the Declaration of Independence in particular or between the decalogue and American law in general.96 The Van Orden court clearly emphasized the latter connection, alleging an "extraordinary influence" of the Commandments "upon the civil and criminal laws of this country."97 Indeed, the court insisted,</page><page sequence="16">418 SOUNDINGS ToddReutzel such is "its continuing influence on our laws" that the decalogue effectively is American law, for the court remarked that "[t]here is no constitutional right to be free of government endorsement of its own laws."98 Even courts that ultimately reject a display as unconstitutional sometimes attempt to emphasize that such displays can be made acceptable because of the decalogue's role in our country's de- velopment. The Sixth Circuit in McCreary County urged, despite its decision, that "[t]he text of the Ten Commandments no doubt has played a role in the secular development of our society and can no doubt be presented by the government as playing such a role in our civic order."99 But have the Ten Command- ments really played such a significant role, particularly in relation to contemporary American law? If the link is highly attenuated at best, it strongly insinuates some ulterior (religious) motive on the part of a government entity seeking to establish or maintain a display of the Ten Commandments on public property. In other words, the historical question represents a crucial factor in deter- mining whether a government body's alleged purpose is a sham when it erects or maintains a Ten Commandments display pur- portedly to show the decalogue's historical impact, for grossly overstating its actual influence is strongly indicative of a relig- iously motivated purpose. A. The Decalogue To evaluate the question of the impact of the decalogue on the American legal system, the character and meaning of the individ- ual commandments must first be understood. The Ten Com- mandments are enumerated twice100 in the Hebrew scriptures (or Christian Old Testament), in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5. A third reference occurs in Exodus 34, in which it appears am- biguous whether the "words of the covenant" inscribed on the tablets of stone in that story were the very different list of com- mands given by the Israelite god, Yahweh, in the god's dialogue with Moses in 34.10-28 regarding the terms of the renewed cove- nant between Yahweh and the Israelites.101 Also, the differences between the traditional versions of the decalogue in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5 largely result from thirteen additions made to the Deuteronomy text as compared to the Exodus version,102 with Deuteronomy's "deviations from Exodus reveal [ing] mod-</page><page sequence="17">These Stones Will Cry Out 419 ernizing tendencies."103 Indeed, "[t]he Deuteronomistic devel- opment of the Sinai Decalogue to reflect Deuteronomic legal concern . . . indicates that the Decalogue was subject to continu- ous revision in the light of new theological ideas," which usually were "the result of political upheaval."104 Nevertheless, while "the question concerning the original Decalogue is still in a state of flux," scholars generally assume "that there was a Decalogue in Israel" that "contained ten statutes . . . recognized as basic."105 A general understanding of the context in which extant ver- sions of the Ten Commandments are presented requires some background understanding of the Documentary Hypothesis re- garding authorship of early components of the Hebrew biblical canon. The Documentary Hypothesis postulates that the first five books of the Hebrew scriptures, Genesis through Deuteronomy, in addition to the six so-called books of history that follow Deu- teronomy in the biblical canon, were "composed by combining four different source documents into one continuous history."106 One source document, J, "was associated with the divine name Yahweh/Jehovah," while another source, called E, referred to God as Elohim.107 A large strand of the text, moreover, came from a source document known as P, which concentrated largely on priestly concerns.108 Deuteronomy originated from another source, known as D, ultimately found to be responsible (though perhaps written at different stages and perhaps by different per- sons) for not only Deuteronomy, but also the next six books of the Bible.109 A final source symbol, R, is used to denote additions made by the redactor who pieced the various strands together into one semi-seamless narrative. This basic framework for much of modern biblical scholarship also rests partly on the realization that, on the basis of knowledge of the "characteristics of biblical Hebrew" at various stages of history, the language of the tradi- tional "Books of Moses" is farther from the Mosaic period "than Shakespeare was from modern English."110 Against this background, the Exodus 20.1-17 version of the Ten Commandments is deemed to have been part of the P source, dating to sometime between 722111 and 609 B.C.E.112 The Deuteronomy 5.6-21 version, from the D source generally (and perhaps the earlier portion of the D source), probably dates to sometime shortly before 609 B.C.E.113 Incidentally, the possi- bly different version of (or at least the general reference to) the</page><page sequence="18">420 SOUNDINGS Todd Reutzel Commandments in Exodus 34.14-28 arose from J,114 with an ear- lier estimated date of around 848 to 722 B.C.E.115 1. The First Four Commandments In terms of the specific commandments themselves, the first commandment instructs the nation of Israel to worship no other gods before Yahweh. The "wording of the commandment . . . does not deny the existence of other gods, but only refuses to recognize their legitimacy for Israel."116 At this point in Israel's history, monotheism had not yet become "a central confession of faith in the Old Testament, as it did later in Judaism and Is- lam."117 The situation has been described by scholars as a poly- theistic way of thinking known as "monolatry," whereby the community's one divinity - in this case, Yahweh - "tolerates or presupposes another divinity in another circle of worshippers or another nation."118 However, Yahweh, a jealous deity, refused to tolerate such alternatives for the nation of Israel.119 Thus, the issue in the commandment was "one of trust and obedience":120 To which god, Yahweh or others, would Israel submit? In short, the commandment presupposed a polytheistic framework radi- cally different from mainstream religious ideology in America from the Colonial period through the present. It was "not until late . . . that the Old Testament came to purely monotheistic statements denying the existence of gods alongside the [pre- sumed] true God."121 The second commandment instructs believers not to make or worship idols. This decree probably proscribed images of Yahweh, designating Yahweh-worship as an image-less religion,122 despite the strongly anthropomorphic conception of God in an- cient Israel and the elaborate material ornamentation connected with temple worship.123 Alternatively, this commandment might have served primarily as an extension of the first commandment, proscribing worship of foreign deities, whether through images of those gods or otherwise.124 Third, the Commandments require Yahweh's people not to misuse the name of Yahweh. Biblical scholars Johann Stamm and Maurice Andrew contend that "[i]t is unanimously agreed [among scholars] that this commandment protects the name of Yahweh from that unlawful use which could take place in the oath, the curse, and in sorcery," for "the name of the divinity</page><page sequence="19">These Stones Will Cry Out 421 [was] an essential means for gaining power over" the god.125 It was Yahweh's way of showing refusal to "put himself at the dispo- sal" of humans.126 The fourth commandment calls on devotees to remember the Sabbath day. While the origin of the sabbath remains highly un- clear,127 it is at least clear that "[f]rom ancient times the Sabbath occurs in the Old Testament as a weekly day of rest."128 2. The Last Six Commandments The fifth commandment, the first chiefly involving human re- lationships, commands that one should honor his or her father and mother. Essentially, this meant that parents in particular were not to be treated in a harsh manner or driven from home in their old age, but rather were to be cared for and protected.129 Next, the commandment proscribing killing attempted to en- sure that the "life of the Israelite [would be] protected . . . from illegal impermissible violence," a commandment that had its place even in a community in which "capital punishment ex- ist [ed] and war [was] permitted or even sometimes commanded [by Yahweh]."130 The kind of "killing" proscribed probably in- cluded even an unintentional killing of a fellow Israelite.131 Ap- parently an unintentional killing resulted in the accused party being given the opportunity to flee to a city of refuge, though if he ventured out of the city of refuge prior to the death of the then-residing high priest, his avenger was permitted to take re- tributive justice into his own hands and kill the accidental of- fender - a principle that American law surely does not countenance . 1 32 The commandment outlawing adultery follows next, a com- mandment that in ancient Israel said "nothing . . . about monog- amy or polygamy."133 Rather, "[t]he purpose of the legislation prohibiting adultery was ... to protect the husband's name by assuring him that his children would be his own," which "ex- plains why the law of adultery [was] restricted to sexual inter- course with a married woman, but [did] not seek to impose sexual fidelity on the husband. There [was] no thought of sexual ethics, but of paternity."134 As a consequence, "[intercourse of the man outside the marriage with unmarried and unbetrothed women" did not offend this criminal proscription, for "seduction of an unbetrothed daughter" not resulting in marriage merely</page><page sequence="20">422 SOUNDINGS Todd Reutzel constituted a civil offense against the father's "property" interest in his daughter,135 requiring the man to pay to the father the girl's going bride-price as a virgin and compelling the man to marry the daughter unless the father objected.136 Given this con- text of religious law, "[o]nly the wife and the betrothed woman [were] bound to faithfulness," and a married man could "com- mit adultery only against the marriage of another man."137 Addi- tionally, "sexual intercourse with a slave could not be termed 'adultery,' since she was the property of her master, and not his wife";138 the master, accordingly, "was permitted intercourse with the female slaves of his house."139 Married or betrothed women originally may not have been subject to execution for this criminal violation, for the women were "regarded as acting involuntarily in cases of adultery."140 Only the woman's lover was subject to trial and execution, with the "injured husband being left with the choice of forgiving his wife or divorcing her."141 Ultimately, though, the Deuteronomist, in a not-too-helpful step forward for women, declared that "the wife, as well as her lover, was to be prosecuted and executed for the crime of adultery."142 When a husband suspected his wife had gone astray but had no direct evidence, or when he was just feeling particularly jeal- ous, the test to determine whether she had committed adultery involved taking his wife before a priest and having her drink bit- ter water that was assured to cause her great suffering if she was indeed guilty.143 The eighth and tenth commandments decree that one shall not steal and that one shall not covet. The prohibition against coveting another man's possessions probably originally men- tioned only another's house, but eventually included other "pos- sessions," including a neighbor's wife, slaves, or animals.144 The prevailing view of this commandment is that it outlawed "the cov- etous will," an offense of thought.145 Some scholars contend that this prohibition actually describes both an "impulse of the will" and "the intrigues which lead to the taking possession of that which was coveted."146 Thus, this commandment might have out- lawed actual theft. Such a view does not necessarily render the theft prohibition superfluous, though, because many scholars ar- gue that the prohibition against theft in the eighth command- ment "originally had in view not theft in general, but kidnapping</page><page sequence="21">These Stones Will Cry Out 423 (the stealing of persons)," in particular the kidnapping of a "free Israelite man," for the "waylaying of dependent persons or those who were not free, such as women, children and slaves" was pro- hibited only by the more general prohibition against theft of a man's possessions under the tenth commandment.147 The version of this commandment in Exodus forbids, first, cov- eting another man's house. The man's wife, slaves, livestock, and other property are lumped together as other "property" not to be coveted.148 The Deuteronomic revision that places the wife before the rest of the property may reflect an attempt to distin- guish her "from the property of her husband"149 or may simply raise her in priority among the husband's property generally. Finally, the ninth commandment decrees that one shall not give false testimony. This provision involved "a prohibition, not of lying [generally] , but of false witness" in the context of a legal proceeding.150 That is, the "ninth commandment refers exclu- sively to witness in the court of law."151 B. The Decalogue in Context Moving beyond the plain language of the Ten Command- ments, since meaning inevitably depends upon context (particu- larly when the language is as nonspecific as the crude dictates of the Ten Commandments), the Decalogue can be fully under- stood only by giving attention to the entire Hebrew religious law of which it is a part. When considered in this context, any margi- nal similarity between the Commandments and contemporary American law quickly fades. This point has already been demonstrated in part by recogniz- ing, for example, the meaning of the prohibition against killing, which in the context of ancient Israel apparently did not pre- clude annihilation of men, women, and children of foreign na- tions in order to preserve the theocracy of Yahweh and did not provide protection for slaves - cruel exceptions that, obviously and fortunately, do not find expression in contemporary Ameri- can jurisprudence. The expansive difference between Hebrew religious law and contemporary American law is so vast that comparing the two seems ridiculous. But just to bolster the point, the chapter follow- ing the Exodus 20 enumeration of the Commandments sets forth, through the narrative voice of the Hebrew deity, a number</page><page sequence="22">424 SOUNDINGS To√†d Reutzel of laws including (1) authorization to purchase other Hebrews as slaves;152 (2) authorization under certain circumstances for slave owners to retain the wife and children of a slave unless the slave elected to remain indentured for life;153 (3) permission for men to sell their daughters into slavery, which indentured them for life - though if the girl failed to please her master, she could not be sold to foreigners;154 (4) provision for one who acciden- tally killed another person to flee to a city of refuge, though if he left the area of refuge he became subject to a vengeance kill- ing;155 (5) punishment, but not the standard death penalty, for beating a slave to death, and no punishment at all for a severe beating of a slave who survived - though in some cases, severe beatings required the master to let the slave go free.156 All of these legal principles were part of a Covenant Code that predated the decalogue157 and established the legal context into which the Ten Commandments were organized as basic Hebrew legal precepts.158 This contextualization further distances the ap- plicability of the Ten Commandments, as understood and em- ployed in ancient Israel, to a modern, secular democracy with very different values and interests. Anthony Phillips makes a simi- lar point with respect to culture-to-culture comparisons of theo- ries of punishment by exhorting readers not to consider the harshness of forms of punishment through the lens of modern punishment rationales: Modern theories of punishment are . . . totally inapplicable when considering reasons why ancient Israel executed her criminals, for the punishment was not looked at from the criminal's point of view. This extreme penalty was not designed to deter potential criminals, nor as an act of retribution, but as a means of providing divine action by appeasing Yahweh's wrath.159 Presumably, we have more pragmatic interests in mind in our system of punishment than propitiating the gods. This survey makes some of the unsupported statements by American courts160 and legislatures about the import of the Ten Commandments utterly shocking: those, for instance, calling the Ten Commandments the cornerstone of a fair and just society. It seems quite odd that the cornerstone of a fair and just society arises from ancient, unrefined, religious legal principles, most of which, after their meaning is unpacked in the context of the le- gal system in which they were embedded, are entirely inapplica- ble to or impractical for a modern nation. What about expansive</page><page sequence="23">These Stones Will Cry Out 425 individual rights and liberties that allow citizens to pursue individual- specific conceptions of a good life? What about criminal due process and protection against cruel and unusual forms of punishment? The Ten Commandments have little to offer with respect to these funda- mental values; and even to the extent that the prohibitions against murder, theft, and false witness are helpful in this regard if properly defined and nuanced, the meaning of each is defined and nuanced far differently in modern America. Besides, as one writer puts it, the idea "that witnesses should tell the truth" or that murder and theft should be outlawed "can scarcely have re- quired a divine spark in order to take root,"161 nor did such guidelines originate with the decalogue. So the historical question does matter. Even when courts ex- plicitly eschew the question of the historical accuracy of asser- tions of religious influence, they nevertheless give at least implicit attention to the issue. In McCreary County, though the majority wished to dodge any attempt to ascertain "the 'correct' view of American history,"162 its analysis suggested that at least some attention to the historical issue is necessary, as evidenced by the court's emphasis on the fact that the defendants' blatant disregard for the real and most important influences on the draft- ing of the Declaration of Independence belied their true mo- tive.163 If the Declaration had been thoroughly and explicitly based on the Ten Commandments or some other religious text, display of that religious text alongside the document of Ameri- can history would be much less likely to be viewed as a transpar- ent attempt to find some specious reason for publicly posting the religious document. But when that religious document has, at best, an extremely marginal and highly attenuated connection to the purportedly associated document of American history, the government motive begins to look like a poor effort to find some way - any way - to post a religious text with the purpose of influencing the public's religious or nonreligious views. This is precisely the sort of government act that should be understood as tending toward establishment. C. The Lack of Impact on Contemporary American Law This foregoing overview of the Ten Commandments, particu- larly in the context of Israel's religious law generally, should make immediately clear their lack of significance for the com-</page><page sequence="24">426 SOUNDINGS Todd Reutzel plexities of contemporary American law. Marci Hamilton, a profes- sor of law at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University, has written an incisive article that thoroughly under- cuts the notion that the decalogue has had a robust influence on the development of the American legal system. In an introduc- tion perceptive enough to justify quoting in full, she writes: When Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore's 2.5-ton sculpture of the Ten Commandments was wheeled out of the courthouse, the furies of hegemonic Christianity were unleashed. Supporters protested, Moore spoke passionately, and commenta- tors echoed the notion that the Ten Commandments are the sole source of American law and therefore never should have been removed. As a Christian, an American, and a scholar, I found the whole thing embarrassing. First, it was such a transparent attempt by Christians to regain power over a country that has become the most pluralistic religious culture in world history. Second, I was appalled that Americans - including television personalities who have a responsibility to their audience to do their homework - could be so uninformed about the history of our legal system, and its many and diverse sources. Third, we proved once more to the world community that as a nation, we have the most abysmal knowledge of history. Worse, this laughable claim about legal history was repeated over and over as plain truth.164 With respect to the first four commandments, each dealing with Israel's direct duties to its god, Yahweh, Hamilton observes that none could be "enacted into law today," for "they would consti- tute plain constitutional violations":165 Early laws in the United States against blasphemy and heresy might be derived from the first three Commandments read to- gether. But those laws long since have been held to be unconstitutional, and rightly so. Were the first three Commandments law, they would bump up against the most important fundamental right in the Constitution: the absolute right to believe whatever one chooses that de- rives from the First Amendment's Free Exercise and Free Speech Clauses.166 As for the remaining commandments dealing chiefly with human relationships, Hamilton affirms that neither honoring one's father and mother nor the prohibition against adultery are legal rules, "but rather moral imperative [s]" at most. Federal and state government has stepped in largely to assume the duty of caring for aging parents through the Medicare and Medicaid sys-</page><page sequence="25">These Stones Will Cry Out 427 tems. One generally has no obligation to treat parents as supe- rior to any other member of society, whether through financial support or otherwise. Also, the fact that adultery may serve as a legally relevant ground for divorce "is hardly the same as incor- porating a direct prohibition against adultery into law."167 She rightly estimates that an attempt to make adultery criminal "would likely be struck down [by the Supreme Court] as uncon- stitutional."168 Even the tort of alienation of affections caused by adultery has been generally abandoned. American law also de- clines to punish coveting - if this is, in fact, what the Hebrew law proscribed - in the interest of First Amendment values, in- cluding freedom of conscience, thought, and speech. This leaves three prohibitions that, while vaguely reflected in contemporary American law, were not unique in the ancient world and are pervasive in contemporary civilizations. As ex- plained above, the decalogue's "murder" prohibition meant something materially different to ancient Israel than it does in modern America. Hamilton points out that the commandment's general proscription apparently does not recognize common American "exceptions, such as self-defense."169 Furthermore, as noted above, the biblical prohibition seems to have included un- intentional killings and outlawed only killing of citizens of the community, since Yahweh periodically demanded the genocide of groups outside the tribal community out of concern that alter- native religious ideas might threaten Yahweh's theocracy.170 Kill- ing of slaves, likewise, did not constitute a killing worthy of the otherwise-required death penalty (and "only" near-fatal beatings, incidentally, called for no punishment at all).171 It should (but evidently does not) go without saying that American criminal homicide law is far more nuanced and pragmatic. In short, an unqualified (or unjustly qualified) prohibition against killing is not only unhelpful, but also useless without giving consideration to what qualifies as a gratuitous or unjustified killing of another human being. With respect to the prohibition against false witness, American law includes the same sensible kind of provision against perjury and additionally outlaws "lies under oath" and some "lies to the government."172 But our nation has also expanded the same principle to create a basis for a civil suit where a misrepresenta- tion results in damages. As to theft, whether of a person (kidnap-</page><page sequence="26">428 SOUNDINGS To√†d Reutzel ping) or property, American law, for quite obvious and practical reasons, includes similar prohibitions. That being said, a vague prohibition against stealing remains essentially unhelpful with- out drawing practical distinctions with regard to what actually constitutes theft, such as excessive forms of taxation, condemna- tion of private properly for public purposes, and adverse possession.173 Even with respect to the two or three commandments that con- stitute legal guidelines vaguely familiar to Americans, Hamilton notes that "it is impossible to attribute the continuing force of these laws solely to" the Ten Commandments: Indeed, "[t]here is no civilized country that has not settled upon these . . . princi- ples."174 Even biblical scholars have noted that "the command- ments [relating to] the relationship with one's neighbor, beginning with the commandment about parents, ... do not show [a] distinctive character" among the various religions of the ancient world.175 There are numerous parallels to these commandments among primitive peoples . . . , and similar parallels can also be brought forward from among Israel's neighbors in the ancient Near East.176 Egyptian and Babylonian texts, for example, list transgressions that "agree exactly with those . . . forbidden in the Decalogue, from the fifth to the tenth commandments."177 Not only were these rules for regulating human relationships not novel legal concepts in the ancient world, the legal code of the Israelites set itself apart only by the principle of "exclusiveness in the worship of God . . . and the prohibition of apostasy"178 - two principles in direct conflict with the First Amendment. Even the Department of Justice remains woefully ignorant of these basic and readily available historical observations. The Jus- tice Department recently filed a brief in support of the Kentucky counties "accused of violating the constitutional ban on govern- ment establishment of religion by posting framed copies of the Ten Commandments" in the McCreary County case discussed above.179 The Department contends that official acknowledg- ment of the influence of the decalogue on American legal history is consistent with the Establishment Clause. Proving Marci Hamil- ton right, the Justice Department shows that America's ignorance of history begins at the top.</page><page sequence="27">These Stones Will Cry Out 429 V. The Diverse Influences on American Law Hamilton observes that "[t]he primary problem with the claim that the Ten Commandments are the sole source of American law is that the facts simply do not support it."180 She explains that "the sources are legion and cannot be traced back to any single origin or tradition,"181 and while disclaiming any attempt at or even the possibility of comprehensiveness, Hamilton notes briefly some of the most important influences on the evolution of Amer- ican law. She begins with the earliest known written law, traced to the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi from the eighteenth cen- tury B.C.E. and "considered by scholars to be the precursor in important respects to Jewish or Hebrew law"; even "the Ten Com- mandments echo some of [its] rules."182 As for the impact of the Ten Commandments, they did not appear until "[r]oughly one thousand years"183 after the Code of Hammurabi. Extant versions of the decalogue in the Hebrew scriptures were not composed until the eighth or seventh centu- ries B.C.E. , though an earlier E text of the Ten Commandments upon which the canonized versions were based may have pre- ceded the biblical versions by a couple of centuries.184 But, as discussed above, the continuing influence of the decalogue is marginal at best. Turning to the Common Era, one of the most significant turn- ing points in western legal and democratic thought occurred in the drafting of the Magna Carta in 1215 C.E., which forced the British King John to give up many rights to the aristocracy .... It was the first declaration that the people's ruler was under the law, the first check on royal power, and it intro- duced nascent concepts of due process, jury by one's peers, free- dom of religion, and no taxation without representation. Parliament used [the Magna Carta] as a wedge against the monarchs, in effect, creating the beginnings of the separation of powers we now take for granted. It is common knowledge that the principles of the Magna Carta were carried across the Atlantic to the New World and the colonies, and bore fruit in the United States Constitution and state laws.185 The Magna Carta was also "a strong influence on later rights dec- larations, including the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights."186 Finally, the bulk of America civil and criminal law,</page><page sequence="28">430 SOUNDINGS Todd Reutzel including the rules against killing and stealing, was borrowed in whole or in part from the British common law - which itself was viewed either as rising from natural law[, a concept far broader than that of the decalogue,] or from custom, not from the Ten Commandments:187 We must consider that, [a] t the Constitutional Convention, the Framers looked to the ex- amples of antiquity - the Greeks and the Romans - and not to the Ten Commandments. They were a pragmatic lot, and they were not interested in being bound by their religious heritage (de- spite today's claims to the contrary). Rather, they were searching for virtually any idea - from virtually any source - that would work to create a better government than the failure produced by the Articles of Confederation .... The sources that influenced the Framers ranged from Greek and Roman law, to John Locke, to Scottish Common Sense philos- ophers .... The influence of the Common Sensists was quite evi- dent in the Framers' strong belief in the power of reason - not revelation or Biblical passages - to determine government.188 A. Undue Emphasis Marci Hamilton avers that focus on the Commandments themselves . . . leads one to forget the enormous complexity of American law. The laws controlling shareholders or the environment can only be attributed to the most labyrinthine reasoning.189 That complex system of law, moreover, has evolved in complex ways. Consequently, undue attention to the decalogue, falsely promulgated by government institutions or officials as having had a substantial influence on the development of the law of our secular nation, is indicative of an interest in participating in the same religious agenda for which the Ten Commandments serve as a prominent symbol for many of our nation's private citizens and organizations. Obviously, the selective process is necessarily indicative of one's interests or purposes. Since historical accuracy clearly cannot constitute the basis for prominent government dis- plays of the Ten Commandments, it becomes distinctly possible, even probable, that they instead serve to expose citizens to the religious message contained in the displays or to reinforce the dominant status in our society of the religious position the mon- uments represent.</page><page sequence="29">These Stones Will Cry Out 431 The Sixth Circuit in McCreary County recognized this point to some degree, commenting that, while it certainly could not re- quire a thorough "recounting of the history of the nation's founding," it envisioned at least a display that does not go out of its way to stress the proposition that the Ten Commandments formed the foundation of the Decla- ration of Independence while utterly ignoring (and implicitly de- nying) all other influences.190 But in another respect, the court underappreciated the rele- vance of selection to consideration of purpose or motive by ex- pressly rejecting the district court's determination that the first alleged purpose of the defendants - that is, that they desired "to erect a [constitutionally passable] display of the Ten Command- ments" - suggested on its face a religious motivation. The Court of Appeals insisted that "the facial purpose is simply to comport governmental conduct (i.e., the displays) with the law":191 "This avowed purpose fails to shed any light on Defendants9 motivation for creating the displays . . . ."192 This bald assertion is absurd. The court obstinately chose to remain oblivious to the fact that the very selection of (singling out of) the Ten Commandments as the content these state bodies wanted to put on display suggests a religious motivation. If the government had asserted, rather, a desire to unpack major influences on the development of con- temporary American law, then such a purpose does not belie un- derlying religious interests - again, as long as the display reflects sufficient historical accuracy to avoid conveying a message of gov- ernment endorsement of religion or a particular religious mes- sage. However, the blunt assertion of a desire to post the Ten Commandments surely says something about the interests moti- vating such a display. Our public legal and private ethical system (though it is hardly so unified as to warrant ascribing to it the coherence implicit in the concept of a "system") derives from the interplay of such a complex array of causal factors, from human biology and social relations to innumerable and ongoing cultural exchanges, that singling out one influence among the countless others inevitable implicates some particular interest in pointing out one particular factor.</page><page sequence="30">432 SOUNDINGS Todd Reutzel B. Contemporary Meaning: The Religious Agenda behind the Symbolic Decalogue Among the multitude of religious symbols recognizable by Americans that are at least as partially representative of the be- liefs of some of our nation's Founders as the Ten Command- ments, it is no coincidence that the Decalogue is the symbol that repeatedly shows up on the grounds of state capitols and in the hallways and classrooms of public schools. The decalogue has be- come culturally recognized as a symbol of religious activism. In the context of contemporary America, the message embodied by the boldly symbolic Decalogue has increasingly become repre- sentative of an effort on the part of a substantial strand of America's religious citizens to counteract the fact that the Judeo- Christian tradition's hegemonic status with respect to American mores has significantly diminished, especially over the last half- century, and with respect to the attendant fact that our increas- ingly pluralistic nation has abandoned some of the values of that tradition. Many religious citizens in America insist on restoring greater consensus with respect to the values they perceive as es- sential to our nation. In short, many desire for their own, distinc- tive conception of God to be returned to a status of hegemony in this country,193 and the Decalogue has become somewhat sym- bolic of this movement. Why else the Ten Commandments? Why not, instead, a plaque discussing the complex, interrelational links between an evolving Christian tradition (containing narratives from which people as different as Martin Luther King, Jr. and Cotton Mather have pur- ported to speak authoritatively) , the rise of secular democracy, the expansion of religious and ethical pluralism, and modern American law? Why not? Because the real interest is not to demonstrate valid historical links. The true interest involves con- veying the message that America is, and ought to be, a Christian nation. In fact, the vagueness of the content of the unrefined princi- ples set forth in the Commandments, alleged to represent a criti- cal source of ethical guidance in the modern world, is further suggestive of the reality that proponents of decalogue displays have something more robust in mind than just the Ten Com- mandments. One wonders how the Ten Commandments will help us determine when it is just to invade a foreign land (partie-</page><page sequence="31">These Stones Will Cry Out 433 ularly in light of Yahweh's capriciously militant nature); how the Ten Commandments will help us sort out a just and workable system of health care in America; how the Ten Commandments will help us judiciously balance competing interests of our citi- zens, such as by (re) distributing social goods (like high-quality education) without unjustly punishing those whose hard work or fortuitous circumstances presently give them a disproportion- ately large share of the pie. The Ten Commandments simply are no help whatsoever in re- lation to the real ethical dilemmas of modern societies. But such an obvious point is somehow overlooked. Indeed, I am con- vinced that such a point goes unnoticed because what propo- nents of displays of the decalogue have in mind when they speak of the "Ten Commandments" is, in reality, the much more robust ethical paradigm of a predominantly evangelical ethos. Insis- tence on the ongoing utility of the crude dictates of the deca- logue with respect to the complexities of modern ethical discourse necessarily entails such a conclusion, and the com- ments of many right-leaning Christians strongly supports that conclusion. The website of Faith and Action Ministries declares: As Americans, we must stand for the Ten Commandments in our towns, communities and nation! One way we can do that is by sup- porting the "Ten Commandments Protection Act of 2003" .... [T]his important bill allows our communities and towns to pub- licly display the Ten Commandments as a symbol of the faith and values needed to heal our land.194 As mentioned above, the site's online petition warns that "courts are stripping the Ten Commandments from our public parks and buildings at a time when our society desperately needs moral guidance and direction" for "[o]ur nation is in a cultural crisis."195 The group argues explicitly that "[t]he Ten Commandments ha [ve] become the defining symbol of this struggle for the soul of America."196 The religious nature of the agenda - perfectly acceptable for a private organization and private citizens until they seek government endorsement of their message - could not be more transparent. In the wake of the controversy he stimulated, Judge Roy Moore's comments suggest the same robust agenda. After grant- ing the organization Veterans Standing for God and Country "permission to take his Ten Commandments monument ... on a tour around the U.S.," Judge Moore remarked, "At a time when</page><page sequence="32">434 SOUNDINGS Tod√† Reutzel our sacred institution of marriage is being assaulted by those who would deny the law of God, Americans need to be reminded of our moral foundation."197 Implicitly referencing the same-sex marriage issue in the context of the Ten Commandments, which say nothing about same-sex marriage, it is clear that advocates have something much more comprehensive in mind when referring to the decalogue. Finally, in Van Orden, the fact that the Ten Commandments monument was dedicated to the "youth" of Texas198 supports this argument. The organization presenting the monument to the State certainly had something more substantial in mind than "thou shall not kill" or "thou shall not steal" in suggesting that the Commandments embodied a value system crucial for the im- pressionable youth of Texas. VI. Acknowledgments of Religion Even the Bush administration has jumped on board the pecu- liar fight to retain Ten Commandments displays on government property, insisting that religion "'has played a defining role' in the nation's history" and "urging the U.S. Supreme Court to per- mit Ten Commandments displays in courthouses."199 So even the President, not shockingly, fails to understand the role of religion in our country's history and fails to comprehend the very strong and important distinction between religion's influence on America and the influence of the Ten Commandments in particular. As shown above, the "influence" of the decalogue on American law is so marginal as barely to justify mention, irrespective of the fact that religion in general has certainly influenced American law and policy, for better or for worse. (Compare, for instance, the prominent use of religious narratives during the Civil Rights movement or in protest of unjust wars with the employment of religious narratives to endorse witch executions, slavery, and seg- regation or to oppose gay rights and stem cell research.) But that general religious impact is a highly convoluted question that de- serves critical attention to the ways in which, to put it rather sim- plistically, Enlightenment thinking began to emerge out of the shadow of a thoroughly religious age, paving the way for the de- velopment of modern secular democracies, with Western relig- ious traditions evolving as a result and with burgeoning secular</page><page sequence="33">These Stones Will Cry Out 435 trajectories inevitably being impacted by a religious past. Such a religious influence is not only poorly represented by a symbol like the Ten Commandments, but this symbol is also fundamen- tally misleading with regard to the relationship of a modern secu- lar nation to religion. In short, the influence of religion - as opposed to the Ten Commandments themselves - on American law is far too complex for the simplistic cause-and-effect relation- ship connoted by a monument inscribed with basic principles of the Hebrew religious law of antiquity. Religion's current relation to American law should probably best be understood as representing a fluid, somewhat indetermi- nate category of commitments of many private citizens who con- tribute to public discourse on issues that, despite the employment of religious premises by those citizens, must be de- cided on the basis of broader decisional premises capable of greater consensus in a nation as diverse as America. For example, we can generally agree that expansive freedom of private expres- sion constitutes a vital fundamental value, but we cannot all agree in America on the theological assumptions underlying the notion that a god has decreed that legally endorsed marriages should only consist of opposite-sex relationships. Consequently, if religious citizens wish widely to persuade other American citi- zens that same-sex marriage should not be permitted, they must do so on (largely pragmatic) grounds more widely accepted than the idea that their peculiar conception of god abhors consensual sex between same-sex couples. This privatized role of religion in relation to contemporary American law and policy makes perfect sense, given America's pluralistic character. Moreover, religion's privatized role demon- strates a crucial point: The modern tradition of secular democra- cies has emerged as a tradition quite independent of religion. While religiously inspired voices may contribute to public dis- course, the tradition itself is in no way dependent upon religious premises. The way in which traditions appear, evolve, merge, in- teract, splinter, and dissipate is highly complex, and the notion that religion should be acknowledged as supplying the underly- ing support for or structure of a strengthening secular demo- cratic tradition is highly dubious. Jeffrey Stout, in his important work, Democracy and Tradition,200 argues that a modern trajectory usefully described as the "demo-</page><page sequence="34">436 SOUNDINGS To√†d Reutzel cratic tradition" has emerged as a tradition in itself that, while including the voices of religious citizens, does not essentially rely on religion for its fundamental values or objectives. Stout shows how the origins of secular democracies began to slowly emerge out of the breakdown of interpretive authority within the Church, leading ultimately to more secularized forms of justifica- tion for public policy decisions. Particularly with the onset of Protestantism, despite the general commitment "to treating the Christian Bible as an authoritative source of normative insight into how [moral and political] questions should be answered," the notion of who was "entitled to interpret" the authoritative text of the Christian tradition and attendant disagreements con- cerning "what this text says and implies" led to a crucial develop- ment:201 Even thoroughly religious citizens in a thoroughly religious context "eventually found themselves avoiding appeals to biblical authority when trying to resolve their ethical and polit- ical differences."202 Consequently, "the differing parties increas- ingly tried to resolve their differences on other grounds," and thus "their ethical discourse with one another became secular- ized":203 "By the end of the 1650s," the Bible had been, in effect, "'dethroned.'"204 Despite the Bible's continuing authority over individual conscience, "the Bible's public discursive authority had virtually disappeared by the end of the [seventeenth] cen- tury."205 Subsequently, appeals to tradition and to the Spirit of God for interpretive guidance also "failed to resolve differences between one person's conclusions and another's" as to who truly was following those sources of guidance properly.206 A contem- poraneous growth in knowledge of the natural world, moreover, compounded the dilemma by supplementing the Bible with "an- other book authored by God"; thus, consistency in public reason- ing not only had to mesh with the now-unclear guidance of the Christian tradition, but also had to harmonize with insights into the external world.207 Thus, the secularization of public dis- course was, rightly so, well on its way to prominence. Of course, none of this entails the silencing of private religious citizens' concerns or even their religiously-based concerns: What makes a form of discourse secularized ... is not the tendency of the people participating in it to relinquish their religious beliefs or to refrain from employing them as reasons. The mark of secu- larization ... is rather the fact that participants in a given discur- sive practice are not in a position to take for granted that their</page><page sequence="35">These Stones Will Cry Out 437 interlocutors are making the same religious assumptions they are. This is the sense in which public discourse in modern democracies tends to be secularized.20 As Stout argues, "Modern democratic reasoning is secularized, but not in a sense that rules out the expression of religious prem- ises or the entitlement of individuals to accept religious assump- tions" in the context of others who share the same beliefs.209 This secular trajectory is particularly important in American polity, for "[o]ur society is religiously plural, and has remained so [to a greater or lesser extent] for several centuries despite constant ef- forts on the part of its religious members to appeal to their fellow citizens with reasons for converting to a single theology."210 A. Acknowledgment versus Endorsement Despite the fact that the democratic tradition has developed as a tradition distinct from any particular religious tradition,211 cre- ating secular trajectories categorically separate from, but involv- ing the voices of, those speaking from religious perspectives, many of America's religious citizens continue to demand that America's government institutions ought to "acknowledge" (whatever that entails) the religious commitments of one particu- larly influential strand of the populace. It is the purported neces- sity of the "acknowledgment" of religion to which decalogue- display advocates consistently appeal in support of their agenda. The website of Liberty Counsel contains a message from the or- ganization's president, Mat Staver, entitled "Public Acknowledg- ment of Religion is Not Establishment of Religion," stating: The decision of the Supreme Court in 2005 on Liberty Counsel's Ten Commandments case will set the course for the future inter- pretation of the First Amendment on such matters as the Pledge of Allegiance, the National Motto "In God We Trust," along with other public acknowledgments of religion. Either America will be able to acknowledge God or it won't. Our heritage and our future are riding on this case.212 Judge Roy Moore, similarly, has contended that his quest is "'not about a monument,'" but rather "'about the acknowledgment of almighty God.'"213 Of course, there is nothing wrong with "acknowledging" relig- ion, if all this involves is an accurate (or, at least, not misleading) depiction of the role religion plays in contemporary America. In- deed, government sponsors this sort of educational lesson every</page><page sequence="36">438 SOUNDINGS Todd Reutzel time students in America's public universities take courses like "Religion in America" in Religious Studies departments, or "Re- ligion and Culture" in Cultural Studies departments, or study the psychological and sociological impact of religion in psychology and sociology courses, or study the historical impact of religion in America in American history courses. To the extent that ac- knowledgments of religion in these contexts present an accurate picture of the role of religion in America, there is no danger of endorsement of religion. This principle of historical soundness and the concomitant principle of government neutrality together reveal the problem- atic nature of generic "acknowledgments" - which are, in fact, patent endorsements - of "God" embedded in government-ad- vocated phrases such as "In God We Trust" and "One Nation under God." Not only do such pronouncements subordinate non-theists to the status of second-class citizens, but they also di- lute the robust meaning of "God" to America's religious citizens under the guise of the artificially unifying expression "God." This point undermines an argument prominent in the Su- preme Court's Lynch decision214 and emphasized by the dissent in McCreary County. Specious comparisons to what are tolerated constitutional violations (despite the Court's insistence that they are constitutionally passable) should be abandoned in this area of jurisprudence. Blatant endorsements of religion over non-re- ligion cannot be legitimized on the basis of longstanding "tradi- tion" or the claimed necessity for "solemnizing" American legal and political rituals and other government occasions. Public high school football games cannot be opened with prayer, and neither should legislative hearings. Courts have used the persistence of these practices to attempt to validate transparent endorsements of religion by government bodies. The McCreary County dissent referenced Justice O'Connor's concurrence in Lynch to support just such an argument, citing the "history and ubiquity" of the practice of displaying the decalogue "in public buildings throughout the country"215 as somehow helping to justify the perpetuation of such practices. In Lynch, Justice O'Connor cited "legislative prayers . . . , printing of 'In God We Trust' on coins, and opening court sessions with 'God save the United States and this honorable court'" as examples of "govern- ment acknowledgments of religion" rather than endorsements of it.216</page><page sequence="37">These Stones Will Cry Out 439 This argument assumes that somehow - apparently by the magic of judicial fiat - the "'history and ubiquity [of] those practices are not understood as conveying government approval of particular religious beliefs,'"217 but rather serve to solemnize public occasions or, as Judge Ryan put it, to "encourag[e] the recognition of what is worthy of appreciation in society."218 But long use does not make a constitutional violation acceptable. Judge Ryan's statement is revealing. The persistence and ubiquity of such governmental practices are strongly suggestive of the fact that the government body endorses the generic religious ideolo- gies implicit in such practices as properly "worthy of apprecia- tion" by its citizens. That is precisely the sort of message citizens like me do not want to hear from our governing bodies: namely, what sort of religious ideology one should find admirable. That is not "acknowledgment." That is endorsement. B. Specious Religious "Foundations" Some also deem the "acknowledgment" of religion essential because they desperately sense that religious premises necessarily must underlie our law in order for it to have any moral force. This point has both theoretical and practical components. On one hand, many insist that religion must theoretically underlie law in order to offer the force of moral absolutes. This claim typically suggests that God is not only the source of law, but that law's efficacy is, in principle, dependent upon God. Judge Moore has made both aspects of this assertion quite openly: "I've kept my oath. I have acknowledged God as the moral foundation of our law,9 Moore told cheering supporters."219 "Moore has long been of the mind that the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and just about every other law on the books first came from the creator. 'I will never, never deny the God upon whom our laws in our country depend."'220 When forced to take down a copy of the Ten Commandments hanging in his courtroom, Ohio Judge James DeWeese "replaced them with an argument in their favor," insisting that "the lack of absolute values endangers everyone": "It allows a student at Columbine High School to decide that his hurt feelings are more important than classmates' lives. It allowed Adolf Hitler to decide that Jews, retarded people and gypsies were inferior human beings who deserved extermination."22</page><page sequence="38">440 SOUNDINGS Todd Reutzel Additionally, in a magazine produced by the well-known evangel- ical organization Focus on the Family, one writer claims: At bottom, the battle to silence speech about God in the public arena is a worldview battle. The battle between moral absolutes and moral relativism is a battle of fundamental worldview assumptions. It is the struggle between theistic views that God is the measure of all things and atheistic views that man is the measure of all things.222 Each of the concerns above essentially echoes Alyosha's fear in The Brothers Karamozov that, without God, all becomes permissi- ble. No reflective person can take this argument seriously any longer. Pragmatically derived "absolutes" - though not absolute in the sense that they are immune from criticism or revision - that are "fundamental" to a secular democracy such as our own, including values like due process and expansive individual free- doms, do not need to be bolstered by rhetorical appeals to divine origins. Rather, these values are time-tested first principles still being unpacked and reinterpreted as we come to a greater con- sensus about how to establish a social structure that overlaps as well as possible with the objective of giving as many people as possible the chance to live happy, satisfied lives. We simply do not need any "foundation" independent of our own, un- abashedly human, ad hoc construction of workable principles and adequate enforcement mechanisms suitable for producing satis- fied human selves in a society in which human preferences and conceptions of a good life are almost endlessly diverse. Indeed, it is precisely because human preferences are so diverse that appeals to religious premises as foundational are so terribly problematic. The lesson of history - even recent history, as Americans should be painfully aware of since September 11th - is that religious premises forwarded as foundational are inevitably troublesome, with power contests over who gets to speak for God (that is, whose human preferences will receive the authorizing label of God's authority). Of course, similar contestation of power occurs around fundamental constitutional principles in America, but the difference is that such principles are (or should be) openly acknowledged as human constructions that are subject to cri- tique and contestation, and interpretations and applications of them are ever-evolving in light of the free flow of ideas with re- spect to how they should be applied. Religious premises, on the other hand, tend to bring such dialogical efforts to a halt.</page><page sequence="39">These Stones Will Cry Out 441 In fact, the very "essence" of religious rhetoric seems diametri- cally contrary to the unsettled nature of democratic reasoning and values. Cultural studies theorist Bruce Lincoln comments: Of particular interest ... is the way religion connects to the other domains of culture: specifically, the capacity of religious discourse to articulate ethical and aesthetic positions in a uniquely stabiliz- ing fashion. What religion does - and this, I submit, is its defining characteristic - is to invest specific human preferences with transcen- dent status by misrepresenting them as revealed truths, primordial traditions, divine commandments, and so forth. In this way, it insu- lates them against most forms of debate and critique, assisting their trans- mission from one generation to another as part of a sacred 994 canon. Philosopher Richard Rorty similarly considers religious rhetoric to be essentially a "conversation stopper": "The main reason re- ligion needs to be privatized" in a pluralistic democracy "is that, in political discussion with those outside the relevant religious community, it is a conversation-stopper."224 Rorty notes that the "happy, Jeffersonian compromise that the Enlightenment reached with the religious" consisted of "privatizing religion - keeping it out of ... 'the public square,' making it seem bad taste to bring religion into discussions of public policy" in exchange for the assurance of religious liberty.225 Thus, our constitutional values and other legal principles not only do not need to be "founded" on religious premises, they cannot be in a democratic community as diverse as our own. Rorty observes that "[i]t is one thing to say that religious beliefs, or the lack of them, will influence political convictions. Of course they will. It is an- other thing to say . . . that the public square should be open to 'religious argument' . . . ."226 And while Stout does not wish to take the argument as far as Rorty, Lincoln, or I would wish, he acknowledges that theological (and non-theological) plurality has an enormous impact on what our ethical discourse is like. It means . . . that in most contexts it will simply be imprudent, rhe- torically speaking, to introduce explicitly theological premises into an argument intended to persuade a religiously diverse public audience.227 The practical component, on the other hand, of this argument that religious premises necessarily must underlie our law in order to have any moral force is a restatement of the principle of Exo- dus 20.20 that one must possess a fear of God to keep from going</page><page sequence="40">442 SOUNDINGS Todd Reutzel astray. As Stout puts it, some think that religious foundations are necessary to ensure moral and political order.228 Of course, to the extent that such a normative statement suggests that one must actually have religious convictions in order to live in accor- dance with American democratic norms, then this assertion is easily empirically falsifiable. To the extent that this proposition suggests that one must subscribe to the same conception (s) of god as evangelical Christians in order to come to share the same moral convictions as evangelical Christians, this statement may, in many cases, be true; however, it is also irrelevant because our government should have no interest in harmonizing the norms of American democracy with the moral preferences of one noisy strand of our society. VII. Distinguishing Free Exercise and Free Speech Finally, a point that deserves mention only because it is so often raised by proponents of religious displays (though a mis- take not made by courts) is that religious displays implicate free speech or free exercise concerns. Though courts have not gener- ally made this mistake, individual judges have misconstrued this issue. Ohio Common Pleas Court Judge James DeWeese made this mistake explicitly: The Ohio Civil Liberties Union contends that my posting of these [Ten Commandments-related] signs in my courtroom violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment .... I contend to the contrary that the case is about freedom of speech, not estab- lishment of religion.229 Furthermore, he added, "It is never appropriate to silence speech in the public arena about such important issues. That is what makes so ironic the efforts of the ACLU to use the First Amendment to censor speech rather than to protect it."230 Marci Hamilton, though, quickly dispenses with this argument: It is important to distinguish the public square from public buildings. Christians have been making the argument . . . that they have been pushed out of the public square. Christians have no shortage of access to the public square, which is where free speech and public debate take place. The Con- stitution strongly and equally protects their free exercise of relig- ion, and their right not to have any religion established as part of our federal or state governments. And there are numerous legiti- mate and effective places for that very free exercise and free</page><page sequence="41">These Stones Will Cry Out 443 speech, other than a courthouse designed to offer justice to all, irrespective of race, creed, or religion. If Justice Moore (in his private and plainclothes capacity, with- out his judicial robes and title) mounted his 10 Commandments statue on wheels today and wheeled it around the country, he'd have 24/7 coverage and apparently plenty of people trailing along. All citizens have the right to proselytize, preach, and promote their religion to their hearts' content. What they do not have is the right to use the government's might and power in the service of their beliefs.2*1 As the Sixth Circuit Court remarked in Adland v. Russ, the Ten Commandments are not in peril. They may be displayed in every church, synagogue, temple, mosque, home and storefront. They may be displayed on lawns and in corporate board rooms.23 But where the Ten Commandments "cannot, and should not, be displayed as a religious text is on government property."233 VIII. Conclusion Though some religious proponents assume so, government does not either endorse religion or endorse non-religion. America's secular system wisely protects the free private exercise of religion, while (in theory, if not always in practice) ensuring that government does not advocate any particular religious per- spective or a religious perspective generally - what Rorty calls the Jeffersonian compromise. Thus, it is partly for the purpose of ensuring religious liberty that the Constitution "mandates that the government remain secular, rather than affili√¢t [e] itself with religious beliefs or institutions precisely in order to avoid discrimi- nating against citizens on the basis of their religious faiths."234 As the Sixth Circuit Court has noted, "at the very least," the Establishment Clause "prohibits government from appearing to take a position on questions of religious beliefs":235 The ultimate effect of this endorsement is to send the ancillary message to members of the audience who are non-adherents "that they are outsiders, not full members of the political community, and the accompanying message to adherents that they are insiders, favored members of the political community."236 Despite this danger, Supreme Court precedent remains porous to continuing Establishment Clause violations and subtle forms of government advocacy of religion, which is particularly prob-</page><page sequence="42">444 SOUNDINGS Tod√† Reutzel lematic in view of "the myriad subtle ways in which Establishment Clause values can be eroded."237 The Sixth Circuit has also urged that a government display of the Ten Commandments must be "in the context of their histori- cal significance."238 It is clear that any distant connection be- tween the traditions influenced by the principles of the decalogue and a modern American secular tradition is so attenu- ated that posting the Commandments among significant influ- ences on American law belies an underlying religious agenda. Unfortunately, as Marci Hamilton writes, "[w]hen it comes to le- gal and religious history, Americans have proven themselves to be woefully ignorant," for "[h]ow else could such untruth about the Ten Commandments' status as an influence on our law be so widely and uncritically repeated and accepted?"239 The Supreme Court presently has the opportunity to make a clear statement that it will not tolerate the failure of local, state, and federal government bodies to respect the diversity of points of view that has become one the great values of the American populace. Diversity of thought and practice constitutes a crucial component of American democracy, compelling citizens to con- front widely diverging interests and values and perpetually stimu- lating new ways of thinking and living. Yet many government bodies - and a number of individual government officials acting in a public capacity - continue to attempt to valorize very con- crete religious perspectives, typically values and religious beliefs associated with a rather vocal element of the Christian commu- nity. The Court has an opportunity to insist that such attempts to legitimize a particular religious perspective over others, or at- tempts to validate the perspective and values of religious citizens over nonreligious citizens, will not be tolerated. As Stout puts it, there is ... something self-deceptive, and implicitly threatening, in appeals to religion as a source of civic unity. Vague references to God from the crepe-lined podium cannot finally disguise the vast array of theistic and nontheistic religions Americans embrace. Need I add that dissenters, free thinkers, atheists, and agnostics are citizens, too?240</page><page sequence="43">These Stones Will Cry Out 445 NOTES 1.

For those who like to employ the principle of original intent to prevent reinterpretation of the Religion Clauses in a contemporary pluralistic con- text far removed from the religious makeup of Colonial America, such persons must acknowledge that the meaning of the Ten Commandments, as employed in the context of Hebrew religious law, was far different than the contemporary understandings of the decalogue in modern America. 159.

Supp. 2d 667 (E.D. Ky. 2000), a Ten Commandments case, David Barton argues extensively in favor of a strong connection between the Ten Commandments and early American Colo- nial law. The website posting this brief is operated by Liberty Counsel, a nonprofit organization dedicated to "restoring the culture" by "advancing religious freedom, the sanctity of human life and the traditional family." (See Liberty Counsel, "Restoring the Culture One Case at a Time by Ad- vancing Religious Freedom, the Sanctity of Human Life and the Tradi- tional Family," 02 Jan. 2005, &lt;http://www.lc.org/aboutus.html&gt;.) Barton cites mid-1 600s state laws outlawing worship of any god other than the "Lord God," under threat of the death penalty, to show the decalogue's first two commandments' impact on early American law.

DisL, 96 F. Supp. 2d 667 (E.D. Ky. 2000). Available at &lt;http://www.lc.org/hotissues/attachments/Affidavit%20-% 20David%20Barton%20re%20impact%20of%20ten%20commandments- %20McCreary.pdf.&gt; He also cites to a Virginia law from the early 1600s proscribing blas- phemy of God under threat of the death penalty (9) and references George Washington's military order regarding observance of the Sabbath during the American Revolution (15), in addition to various civil Sabbath laws (16-17). In this context, Barton contends that "[w]hile contemporary critics argue that the first four commands of the Decalogue were inconse- quential in our history . . . , the facts prove that they exerted a substantial influence on American jurisprudence" (17). Of course, none of this has any relevance to contemporary American law. What interest does the gov- ernment have in reminding citizens of the partial foundation of long- abandoned laws that are quite blatantly unconstitutional under contempo- rary constitutional jurisprudence, not to mention highly impractical in America's modern pluralistic context? With much greater confidence, Barton urges that the remaining por- tion of the Decalogue - the commandments relating to human relation-</page><page sequence="49">These Stones Will Cry Out 451 ships - "formed the basis of many of our current criminal laws" (18). He refers to outmoded laws relating to one's parents and relating to adultery to support the organization's position. A 1642 Connecticut law declared that anyone who "curse [s] or smite [s]" her mother or father "shall be put to death" - unless, of course, the parents had been "very unchristianly negligent" or cruel (18-19). Also, Barton references a 1641 Massachusetts law proscribing adultery, with offenders subject to the death penalty (21- 22). But once again, what interest does the government have in linking a religious text to marginal laws no longer on the books? A stronger interest would exist in connecting trajectories of the "Christian tradition" (and to a more attenuated extent the Hebrew tradition) in general to American government and law. (See below for discussion.) The coveting prohibition is described as constituting the (very attenu- ated) "basis" for laws against defamation and, strangely enough, cattle rus- tling, among other violations (26-27). It is noted that criminal provisions outlawing murder are, of course, too numerous to recount (19-20), but as discussed above, the decalogue's prohibition looks far different than cur- rent American law relating to criminal homicide. Finally, Barton mentions various court references to the divine origin of prohibitions against theft (22-23), as well as biblical references by courts and legislatures validating laws against perjury (24-25). In both cases, the connection is so attenuated and partial that it strains the bounds of credu- lity to assert, irrespective of who makes the assertion, that the Ten Com- mandments somehow constitute the primary or even a significant basis for the perpetuation of such laws in modern America. David Barton's entire affidavit misses the point. So what if the Founders wanted state-"endorsed" Christianity, but no state-"established" form of it? The obvious contemporary point is that that is unacceptable now in our modern context of unbounded diversity. We perpetually and rightly rein- terpret the original meaning of the Constitution in light of properly evolv- ing values. It was also apparently not "originally intended" that the freedom and equality of all "men" should properly include non-whites and women. But those unjust constructions of who should receive the full share of constitutional liberties has been properly reinterpreted to include formerly oppressed groups. Unfortunately, the court in McCreary County, ventures in the opposite direction on this point: The Court has acknowledged that the fears and political problems that gave rise to the Religion Clauses in the 18th century are of far less concern today. We are unable to perceive the Archbishop of Canter- bury, the Bishop of Rome, or other powerful religious leaders behind every public acknowledgement of the religious heritage long officially recognized by the three constitutional branches of government. Any notion that these symbols pose a real danger of establishment of a state church is far-fetched indeed. (ACLUv. McCreary County, 354 F.3d 438, 482 [6th Cir. 2003; Ryan, J., dissenting]. Quoting Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 686 [1984]) But the fact that we do not presently live under conditions likely to produce a fully established state religion does not mean that subtle forms of govern- ment advocacy of particular religious views should be countenanced. 167.
