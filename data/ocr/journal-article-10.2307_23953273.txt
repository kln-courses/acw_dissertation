<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE HERESY OF TATIAN The most famous disciple of the apologist Justin was the Syrian rhetorician Tatian, who remained within the Christian church until Justin's martyrdom between 163 and 167. At a later point he left the church and undertook to become a teacher himself. Irenaeus, bishop of Lyons, writing between 180 and 185, denounces Tatian's self-esteem (evidenced in the Oration) and condemns three errors in his teaching. (1) He invented certain invisible 'aeons' like those of the Valentinians ; (2) he denounced marriage as 'corruption and fornication' as Marcion and Saturninus had done; and (3) he denied the salvation of Adam (Adv. haer. i. 28. 1). We have no reason to criticize Irenaeus's remarks. The Valentinian aeons represent an effort to separate God as far as possible from the created world. Similarly Marcion's rejection of marriage is a rejection of the goodness of creation ; and the denial of Adam's salvation is due</page><page sequence="2">NOTES AND STUDIES 63 to the belief that the 'natural man' is incapable of redemption, and that the 'natural body' cannot be raised. The question we must ask is whether Tatian's heresy is reflected in his extant Oration to the Greeks, a violent polemic against Graeco Roman culture in general, in the course of which he devotes several chapters to setting forth his own theological views. Was Tatian a heretic when he wrote, or was he simply an extremist with heretical leanings ?* One's answer to this question will depend on the way in which one reads his work, and the way of reading will depend in large measure on the date of the Oration. It may be said at once that the Oration was not written while Tatian was still Justin's disciple. Clear chronological notices make plain the fact that it was written after the year 176.2 The most obvious of these is Tatian's criticism of philosophers for receiving salaries from the Roman emperor (Or. 19. 1). This notice refers to the subsidy of philosophical teaching at Athens by Marcus Aurelius in the autumn of 176. Tatian's Oration, then, is one of several Christian responses to the critical persecutions which began either late in 176 or early in 177, and culminated in the martyrdoms at Lyons in the summer of 177. It is worth noting, however, that he does not refer to Christians or to Christianity but speaks of 'barbarians' and 'barbarian philosophy'. It is by no means certain that he is defending the Christian church as a whole. What seems most likely is that he is making common cause with the church in persecution, and that for this reason he refers twice to Justin, claiming to teach what Justin taught (18. 2) and to have been persecuted with Justin (19. 1). But does he teach what Justin taught ? He says that Justin compared the demons to robbers ; but his own doctrine (12. 4) goes beyond Justin to explain that the demons, generated from matter, desired to become robbers of the divine nature. Like robbers they deceived the souls which had been abandoned by the divine Spirit (14. 1). This is not Justin's teaching. Instead, it closely resembles the doctrine of the Valentinian Theodotus (Clement, Exc. 72. 2). In the Oration Tatian speaks of 'better aeons' above the heaven. They enjoy 'unapproachable light' (an expression paralleled in 1 Tim· 616).4 From a 'better earth' the first men were exiled (20. 1-2). These aeons 1 The latter view is expressed most recently, perhaps, by G. Bardy, Diction naire de théologie catholique, xv (Paris, 1946), pp. 59-66. 2 Cf. my note in Harvard Theological Review, xlvi (1953), pp. 99-101. 3 For the view that it was critical cf. H. Chadwick, Origen: Contra Celsum (Cambridge, 1953), p. xxviii. 4 So Ubaldi. If this is an allusion it may suggest that Tatian knows the Pastoral Epistles; after all, he accepted Titus as Pauline (Jerome, Praef. Comm. in Tit.; A. Hilgenfeld, Die Ketzergeschichte des Urchristenthums (Leipzig, 1884), p. 391.</page><page sequence="3">64 NOTES AND STUDIES are evidently the Valentinian aeons which constitute the Pleroma; the 'better earth' is Paradise, which Theodotus identifies with the fourth heaven (Exc. 51. 1). In the Oration he criticizes the Homeric gods for 'marrying, corrupt ing boys, committing adultery . . .' (8. x) and complains that Aphrodite 'delights in the embraces of marriage' (8. 2). This might be merely philosophical criticism of anthropomorphism, but he also denounces a woman's bearing thirty children as the result of 'much incontinence' (34. 1). Evidently marriage is close to fornication. Finally, since immortality is obtainable only when the soul forms a union (syzygy, a favourite Valentinian term) with the divine Spirit (13. 2), and since the divine Spirit was lost by the first men (7. 3), the first man Adam cannot have been saved. We therefore conclude that the three errors of which Irenaeus speaks are reflected in the Oration ; it was written when Tatian had already left the church; and perhaps Irenaeus derives his knowledge of Tatian from it. It must now be asked whether there are other traces of heresy, especi ally Valentinianism, in the Oration. In the first place, Tatian's use of the term 'the perfect God' (4. 2; 12. 4; 15. 2; 17. 4; 25. 2) arouses suspicion, since it is also used by the Valentinian Ptolemaeus (Ep. ad Floram 3. 4; 7. 3, 5, 6). Tatian speaks of God as the sole principle of all things (4.1), just as Ptolemaeus (Ep. 7. 8) does; other second-century apologists (Justin, Dial. 62. 4; Theophilus, Ad Autol. 2. 10) speak of the Logos as the sole principle. Tatian mentions the 'law of the Father of Incor ruptibility' (32. 1), and Ptolemaeus says that the substance of the Father is incorruptibility (Ep. 7. 7); it is this Father who gave the pure Law of God (Ep. 5. i).1 Tatian's doctrine of creation is unguarded, to say the least, since he states that the Logos, begotten by the Father, in turn 'begot' the crea tion (5. 2). This seems to reflect the Valentinian doctrine of the emana tion of aeons. God made man 'the image of immortality' (7. 1). Man possessed the divine Spirit, which is the image and likeness of God (12. 1). When he followed the 'more prudent' angel, now become a demon (Gen. 31), the Spirit departed from him and he became mortal (7. 2-3). The human soul, however, still possesses a 'spark' (enausma, Tatian's substitute for the more common spinther)1 of the Spirit's power; it can recover its lost union with the Spirit by repentance and faith. If man's soul and flesh be like a temple, God will dwell in it through his 1 Demons gave men 'laws of death' (15. 4); if among these laws Tatian includes the Mosaic legislation, Ptolemaeus would disagree (Ep. 3. 2-5). 2 Cf.

Ultimately the united Spirit and soul will gain immortality as a cloak of mortality, and the naked man will be clothed («· 3)· What of the flesh? The flesh dies (13. 2), even though it holds the soul (15. 2). Tatian says that the flesh does not rise again apart from the soul (15. 1), but his statement does not imply that it rises at all. There will be a resurrection of bodies (6. 1), but when Tatian gives any indication of the substance of these bodies he calls it not flesh (sarx) but 'fleshly element' (sarkion, 6. 2; 25. 2). In his index to Tatian, Schwartz calls this a Cynic word; more significantly it is a technical term of the Valentinians.1 We conclude that in Tatian's view the 'fleshly' resurrection is a resurrection of the soul and Spirit alone, apart from anything more material than the soul (20. 3). The soul without knowledge bends down toward matter and dies with the flesh (13. 2). Tatian's doctrine is largely based on the Pauline epistles. The 'dwel ling-place from heaven' (2 Cor. 52) which will clothe us so that we are not naked is closely related to the Spirit (2 Cor. 55; Tat. 13. 2). The 'breastplate of the heavenly Spirit' (16. 2) echoes Eph. 6*4, 1 Thess. 5s, 2 Cor. 104, and Rom. 1312. Like Paul (Col. 220; Rom. 6"~12) Tatian urges men to 'die to the world' and 'live to God'. He alludes to Rom. η1* when he says that 'through sin we were sold' (11. 2). These expressions are related to a doctrine of baptism which is close to what we find in Theodotus. Theodotus tells us that baptism is called 'death' and 'end of the old life' (Exc. 77.1) ; it transforms not the body but the soul (77. 2) ; and the baptized person is master over the impure spirits (77. 3 ; Tatian's demons) and above fate (78. 1). Tatian's notion of conquering death by death (15. 4) is paralleled in Exc. 80. 2; and, most important of all, Theodotus too speaks of the Spirit of God received at baptism as the Image (86. 2).2 Unfortunately it is difficult to tell whether the 86th chapter of the Excerpta comes from Theodotus or is substantially modi fied by Clement; we cannot therefore ascribe Tatian's doctrine to Valentinianism. The more fully developed doctrine of Irenaeus pre sumably comes from the common Christian tradition, as does that of Tatian.3 If we ask a more speculative question we may inquire how Tatian can have viewed the Incarnation. We may perhaps assume that as the Spirit 1 F. M.

Geffcken, Zwei griechische Apologeten (Leipzig, 1907), pp. 105 f. 621. χ</page><page sequence="5">66 NOTES AND STUDIES of God came to dwell among some (prophets) who lived righteously and was mingled1 with their soul (13. 3), so the Logos descended to Jesus and was mingled with his soul ; the Logos dwelt in him as in a temple (15. 2; cf. John 221). Since he was 'guarded by the Spirit of God' he could easily see demons; he was spiritual, not psychic (cf. 15. 3). Pre sumably this teaching can be completed by what Theodotus says of the Saviour (Exc. 3. 1): 'When the Saviour came he awakened the soul and enflamed the spark; for the words of the Saviour are power.' The result of the Saviour's coming would have been to enable us to reject the 'generation according to fate' (11. 1), the 'old generation', by which 'we brought forth evil' (11. 2). Now we have become 'far from humanity and advance toward God himself' (14. 2; cf. Exc. 76. 2). We conquer death by death through faith (15. 2); we conquer the demons (16. 2); we are masters of our passions and despise the things in the world (19. 3). This conception resembles that of Theodotus (Exc. 76. 1 ) : 'The birth of the Saviour drove us out from generation and fate.' Tatian is more militantly opposed to natural generation than Theodotus is; none of the Valentinians rejected marriage. Finally we may examine two examples of exegesis which Tatian gives. In the first place he explains that the 'darkness' which did not 'compre hend the Light' (John is) was the soul without knowledge (13. 1-2). In a more explicitly gnostic, but still similar, way Theodotus seems to explain this darkness as the 'Powers of the Left', not 'formed' by the coming of the Light (Exc. 34. 1). These are psychic and hylic powers. In the second place, there is what Puech2 calls the most obscure text in Tatian's work (30. 1): We know that the existence of wickedness is like that of the smallest seeds, since it grows strong from a small opportunity and again will be destroyed if we obey the word of God and do not scatter ourselves. For it has overpowered our existence through some hidden treasure; when we dug it up we were filled with dust but gave it the opportunity of existing. For he who acquires everything as his own possession has obtained authority over much-honoured wealth. The clue to this passage may lie in Valentinian fondness for exegesis of the parables. The first part seems to be based on a combination of two parables, one that of the grain of mustard, smaller than all other seeds (Matt. 133χ-32), the other that of the tares sown by the enemy in the same field as the good seed (Matt. i324-3°, explained in 36-43). The tares are treated as equally small as the good seed. In Valentinian exe 1 A Valentinian expression, cf. Sagnard, La Gnose, p. 655. 2 Les Apologistes grecs du second siècle de notre ère, (Paris, 1912), p. 169.</page><page sequence="6">NOTES AND STUDIES 67 gesis the tares consist of the sarkion or fleshly element (Theodotus, Exc. 53. 1). So in the sixth chapter of the Oration the sarkion may be burned but the essential man (soul-Spirit) is 'laid up in the treasuries of a wealthy Master', just as the tares are burned but the grain from the good seed is gathered (not scattered) and placed in the barn. The seeds which hear and obey the word of God bring forth good fruit (cf. Matt. 1323)·1 The second part seems to be a combination of the parable of the treasure hidden in a field (Matt. 1314, so Puech), the parable of the pearl (Matt. 1345-46), and the saying about laying up treasure in heaven, where thieves do not dig through (Matt. 620). The digging for the heavenly treasure may give the opportunity for the word of God to exist; the 'dust' is probably the material world (which must be 'shaken off', cf. Matt, io^); and the 'much-honoured wealth' reminds us of the 'much honoured pearl' of Matt. 1346. Tatian's language remains enigmatic. He is really speaking to 'his own' (30. 1). What he means may be what other Valentinians said : just as gold placed in mud is not harmed by it, so the spirituals are not harmed by the material world (Irenaeus, Adv. haer. i. 6. 2). We need not deal here with the fragments of Tatian On Perfection According to the Saviour which cannot be dated except as being later than his period, in the church. His treatise On Animals, to which he refers in the Oration (15. 2), already set forth his analysis of human nature ;2 and we may conclude that by the time he wrote the Oration he had long since fallen under the influence of Valentinian thought.? Per haps he had encountered Ptolemaeus himself at Rome, and later had met Valentinians of the 'oriental' school. It may be added that Wilamowitz suggested that Tatian refers to Aelius Aristides in his description of the sick man who relies on demons4 (Or. 18. 3 ; cf. 3. 3-4—Herodes Atticus?). In turn, Aelius Aristides may be referring to Tatian in his 46th oration. Certain cynics somehow dissociate themselves from the Greeks ; they assume the name of philo sophy; they do not honour the gods; they do not take part in govern ment; they do not recognize their superiors; and they are like 'the 1 The 'scattering' of ourselves to which Tatian refers (Or. 30) is probably best explained from Luke 1513, where the prodigal son 'scatters' his ousia. 2 Cf. my Miracle and Natural Law (Amsterdam, 1952), pp. 98-99. 3 Tatian's view, known to Clement (Eel. proph. 38. 1) and Origen (Orat. 24. 5), and probably to Celsus (Origen, Contra Celsum, 6, 51) that 'Let there be light' was a petition of the Demiurge to the 'higher God', does not seem to be re flected in the Oration. Celsus may have read Tatian's Oration; cf. Or. 27. 1 with Orig. C. Cels. 3. 43 (p. 157, n. 2 Chadwick) and Or. 28 with C. Cels. 8. 72. 4 E.
