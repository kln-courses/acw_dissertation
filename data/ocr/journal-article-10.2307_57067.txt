Recent work has shown how analysis of moving image contours can provide estimates of the shape of curved surfaces. This forms the basis of the robot's capabilities which we are seeking to elaborate in three respects. First a computational model - the 'dynamic contour' - is being developed for real-time visual tracking, based on simulated Lagrangian Dynamics. Secondly we are developing a two-and-half-dimensional system for incremental, active exploration of free-space. Thirdly a computational theory of the visual planning of two-fingered grasps has been developed which can be coupled to the 'dynamic contour' model. This paper concentrates on the third of these topics. A qualitative theory for classification of grasps is described and demonstrated. Optimal finger positions are obtained from the mutual intersection of the local symmetry and anti-symmetry sets, and of a third set, the critical set of the grasp map. These three sets themselves form boundaries in a natural partition of the set of all grasps (the configuration space). The partition corresponds to a classification of possible grasps according to their stability properties. 1. INTRODUCTION This paper outlines a model for planning grasping actions. This is done in the context of a robot system driven by 'active vision' (Aloimonos et al. 1987; Kass et al. 1987; Ballard 1991). We are attempting to build a system that links perception with action in real time. The past ten years has seen a gradual movement away from the Marrian view of vision (Marr 1982) as a static, information-gathering process. The earlier view of Gibson (1979) of vision directly linked to action is attractive, particularly for certain low-level perceptual tasks such as catching, and moving around obstacles. This partial retrenchment is encouraged by practical advances in computing, especially in parallel comput- ing. As the power of parallel processors has increased, the demands on them by vision processes, linked more and more directly to action, has decreased. The result has been the emergence of practical visually driven robots (Faugeras &amp; Hebert 1986; Brady et al. 1987; Dickmanns &amp; Graefe 1988; Pichon et al. 1989; Rimey &amp; Brown 1992). We are currently building visually guided grasping expertise into a robot which can reach around obstacles. A CCD camera is mounted on the wrist of an ADEPT robot and a computer continually monitors visual signals. Deliberate, exploratory motions are coordinated with visual computation so as to explore the shape of three-dimensional, curved obstacles (Gib- lin &amp; Weiss 1987; Blake &amp; Cipolla 1990; Cipolla &amp; Blake 1990). The visual computation itself is based on dynamic contours (Kass et al. 1987; Curwen &amp; Blake 1992) which are strongly focused onto obstacle sil- houettes and hence efficient. They are computed in Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B (1992) 337, 351-360 IPrinted in Great Britain 351 parallel. The combination of focused attention and parallelism leads to real-time performance. This in turn allows integration of perception with control systems for action (figure 1). Coordinated, sequenced perception and action drives the robot to reach around obstacles towards a goal (Blake et al. 1991; Blake et al. 1992), as in figure 2. Currently, the robot is able to reach around obstacles and retrieve objects. Equipped with a suction gripper it is able to grasp only relatively flat objects. For instance, it can locate a hidclen box and remove its lid. For more flexible grasping it would be desirable to use a gripper with fingers. Complex, anthropomorphic hands have been built (Salisbury &amp; Roth 1983) but, for control purposes, the simplest gripper is a two-fingered one. The fingers may open and close either with parallel motion or with hinged motion. They may either be plates or thin cylinders. Of course the human hand has a wide repertoire of grasps (Elliot &amp; Connelly 1984). The assumptions of our model are probably closest to the index roll, a grip between thumb and index finger. In this paper we outline a theory for relating the control of a two-fingered gripper to the information available directly from visual contours. We build on the notable work of Faverjon &amp; Ponce (1991), extending it to obtain qualitative rules for equilibrium and stability of grasp based on contour shape. The result is a computational procedure for obtaining seed grasps, locally optimal finger positions which seem to be intuitive grasps in many cases. The classification of seed grasps is based on an elementary use of differen- tial analysis, of the kind used by Bruce &amp; Giblin in their taxonomy of symmetry sets (Bruce &amp; Giblin C 1992 The Royal Society [ 99 ]</page><page sequence="2">352 A. Blake Computational modelling of hand-eye coordination Figure 1. A 'dynamic contour' visual tracker follows the motion of a model vehicle. The camera is mounted on the wrist of an ADEPT robot which rotates the camera to maintain the contour in the centre of the image. The contour, a computed B-spline, is shown in white, overlaid on the images. (Figure by courtesy of R. Curwen.) 1984). Indeed the classification of grasps turns out to be closely coupled to symmetry properties. Results of a practical computer algorithm based on this analysis of seed grasps indicates their value as qualitative predictors of grasp stability. Figures 3 and 4 show object outlines procured from our active contour tracker. The robot directs the camera's gaze towards the object to be grasped and the dynamic contour is allowed to lock onto the outline. Then the qualitative analysis of grasp is applied to the contour and distinguished grasp points - the seed grasps - are marked. They can be classified type 1 and type 2. Type 1 seeds remain in equilibrium as the coefficient of friction tends to zero whereas type 2 require some minimum degree of friction for equilibrium. In the case of type 1 points, a measure of stability can also be computed. A reasonable grasping strategy is to try the most stable grasps first. The remainder of the paper explains how a theory of two-fingered grasps can be constructed which leads to the computational results like those just shown. 2. EQUILIBRIUM OF GRASPS We assume, in this paper that a thin, planar object bounded by a closed curve is to be grasped by a two- fingered gripper. Only the two-dimensional problem will be considered in which the object rests on a plane. It is to be gripped by fingers that move only in that plane. Gravitational effects are not considered. The question is simply whether, when gripped, the object remains static. Imagine grasping a coin resting on a highly polished table: how can the coin be gripped in two fingers without it shooting across the table? In order to study grasps that are in equilibrium in this sense, a mathematical condition for equilibrium is needed. It is standard to use the 'force-closure' property (Latombe 1991) which is a sufficient condi- tion for equilibrium. A set of contact points on a body satisfies the closure condition if any given force and couple on the body can be achieved by some set of positive normal forces at the contacts. In this paper we consider conditions for force-closure with frictional fingers. In the case of a two-dimensional polyhedral Figure 2. The robot directs the camera's gaze towards one of two obstacles, attempting to plan a path between them. The goal object is marked by the vertical white column in the distance.

(a) An electrical plug, as seen by an ADEPT robot's wrist-mounted camera. Its outline is captured by a 'dynamic contour' tracker. Once captured, the contour is frozen and analysed for grip. (b) Seed grips shown here are all of 'type 1', grips that remain in equilibrium as the coefficient of friction approaches zero. They are parallel grips, in which the two fingers (depicted by rectangles) are placed at opposing points on the contour. Four such grips are shown here. The length of each rectangle depicts a measure of stability for one finger in a two-fingered grasp. body, Markenscoff et al. (1990) showed that three such fingers are always sufficient for force-closure. This assumes that vertices are to be considered ungraspable: an appropriate assumption for thin fingers but unduly conservative when the fingers are plates, as in the parallel-jaw gripper or when grasping a smooth curve. Given that we are using B-splines to represent visual contours it is more natural to consider two-dimen- sional bodies as being bounded by a smooth contour, rather than as a polyhedron. Then, it transpires, every contour has at least one force-closure grasp with just two contact points. Following Nguyen (1988) and Faverjon &amp; Ponce (1991), the force-closure of a two- fingered grasp can be established by a simple geo- metric test, expressed in the notation of figure 5. The contour itself is denoted r(s) where s is a parameter which will usually be taken to be true arc-length. Grasp points are at s= sl,s2. Friction angles 01,L2 are defined at the two points.
