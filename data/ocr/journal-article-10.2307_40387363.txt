TUI ATUA TUPUA TAMASESE TAISI TUPUOLA TUFUGA EFI Abstract This article touches upon views gained from traditional or oral history together with views of modern scientific method to reach at understandings of past actions. The text presents an ernie view concerning the Pulemelei mound and a ceremony carried out at the site in 2003. It is an edited version of papers presented at Auckland University in 2003 (Tamasese 2003) and at the inauguration of an exhibition at the Kon-Tiki Museum in 2004, which featured the results of the archaeological excavations at Pulemelei mound in 2002-2004. In search of Tagaloa: Pulemelei, Samoan mythology and Science I want to begin my paper on the search for Tagaloa with a quote from Thor Heyerdahl (1998): And both the wind and the people who continue to live close to Nature still have much to tell us which we cannot hear inside university halls. A scientist has to distinguish between legend and myth and make use of both. Thor was one of the few scientists I know that actively engaged in an attempt to do this and to do so in a way that afforded our peoples and our knowledge respect and dignity. Pulemelei and the archaeological excavation In September 2002, the first archaeological excavations at Pulemelei began under the supervision of Drs Helene Martinsson- Wallin and Paul Wallin (Kon-Tiki Museum) and Dr Geoffrey Clark (ANU). The Pulemelei site is made up of several mounds. The principal mound was excavated during 2002-2004. When the excavation reached foundation level and the near approaches were cleared, the spectacle of what was exposed was awesome. It invited re-assessment. In terms of the Samoan landscape, the Pulemelei mound seemed to me to be overwhelmingly large and high. One of the smaller mounds on elevated ground to the North gave a commanding view of the top level of the principal mound. Another platform on the Southern slope and the other stone platforms nearby each incited wonder and curiosity. Even more curious was the pathway from the East. The pathway or auala in Samoan, is significant in Polynesian culture. Our funeral rituals are called auala or the pathway, meaning the pathway to lagi (heaven) or Pulotu (the underworld) (Pratt 1977; Mosel and Hovdhaugen 1992). From the top of the mound one has a good view to the South and it is possible to trace a "pathway" linking Manono, Apolima and Upolu islands. In early 2003 bush and trees hid this "pathway". However, today the "pathway" is clearly visible, thanks to the clearings made by the hurricane in January 2004. Whilst at the top of the principal mound one can not help but reflect on the strategic and navigational value of such a view for our ancestors. Making connections: Polynesian mythologies, genealogies and science In early 2003 I invited two Maori friends, an anthropologist Dr Pita Sharpies, and Rev Morris Gray, former Head of the Maori Dept at the University of Canterbury, to visit Pulemelei. We climbed the path to the Pulemelei complex and to the top of the large Pulemelei mound, where we seated ourselves on flat slabs of stones. Shortly after, Morris stood up, walked inwards, stopped when he reached the middle, threw his arm out and pointed to the ground: "Down in the bottom in the ground level is buried an arikF he said. He seemed like someone who was, as we say in Samoan, ua ulu i ai le agaga, meaning 'possessed'. "I know this place" he continued, "this is where our people came from. My family emblem is the wheke (octopus) and this mound is a legacy of the wheke. And, there are in this environment definitive markings which underline the sacred figure of eight". Morris's reference to the wheke and the figure of eight impacted on me because the river that flows through the plantation on which Pulemelei is sited has eight waterfalls. He did not know this at the time. "There are links between this mound and the skies, the sun, the moon and the stars", he proclaimed. "There is a link between this mound and the pathway". The astronomy of this, he suggested, was what enabled the Polynesia Diaspora. He then called to the plantation manager, "Where does the sun rise?" The plantation manager responded, "You are facing the direction of the sunrise". Morris was standing directly in front of the principal pathway to the top of the mound, suggesting that the pathway pointed to the direction of the sunrise. He turned to me and said, "I ask for your leave to address our forbears in chant". When given, he began to chant. At the bottom of the mound we saw the Samoan people down there instinctively stand. I pondered on this, on why they stood for a Maori chant. When the chanting was over, he walked towards me and said, "If 5</page><page sequence="2">there's going to be an archaeological excavation, in all likelihood they will come across human remains. In that case we require a purification ritual". In searching for why and how we should conduct the purification ritual at Pulemelei I became fascinated by the suggested links between Pulemelei and Tagaloa. Thus began my search for Tagaloa. In search of Tagaloa: moving between mythology, genealogy and science In the cosmologies of most Polynesian peoples Tagaloa is the senior anthropomorphic god. He is pre-eminent in Samoa and Tonga and is the pre-existing Creator in Tahiti. In East Polynesian cosmology, he is equal with other first order gods (Marck 1996). The fact that important founding ancestors attained the status of gods is evidence that, for Polynesian peoples, Tagaloa was a very important founding ancestor. The correlation for Polynesians between biological origins (Cavalli-Sforza et al 1994) and language (Pawley 2002) and culture is one therefore founded on genealogy and mythology. The fact that the name and status is so widespread suggests that he was part of Polynesian tradition from an early stage. For Polynesian peoples Tagaloa is more than a tradition: Tagaloa is mythology, history, culture and heritage. In contemporary Samoa, Samoan culture, its lands and chiefly titles are ultimately founded on mythology, a mythology which links back to Tagaloa (Stair 1896, 1898; Krämer 1994). Tagaloa in Samoan/Polynesian mythology In the Tagaloa mythology, the earth is the consequence of the Big Bang i.e. the separation of Lagi (heaven) and papa (rock) and human life originates from germs {ilo) (Andersen 1928). The Tagaloa thesis could be viewed as closer to the scientific explanation of evolution than what is said in biblical texts. In Samoan/Polynesian mythology Tuli (Pacific Golden Plover, Pluvialis fulva a winter migrating bird), Tagaloa's messenger, was sent down to earth and discovered the Samoan islands. Here he introduced varieties of plants and trees. After Samoa, the plovers did the same for Tonga and Fiji. Then the plovers, by Tagaloa's commands, designated the figure of Man from germs and they were sent to populate these three islands (Fraser et al. 1891) The Tagaloa regime is well recorded in Samoan oral history, especially its fall. To this day, it is commemorated by the chant at a chief's funeral: Tulouna a le lagi ma le lagi ma le lagil The orator chants the honorifics (fa'alupega) of each of the nine heavens. When the orator reaches the honorifics of the ninth heaven, a member of the deceased family will intervene and invite them, i.e. orator and party, into a residence as official mourners. The chant is their passport into residence. In the ninth heaven, Amoa the daughter of Tagaloa intervened on behalf of her father and offered herself in marriage in order to spare her father and his personal entourage from the wrath of the victor Lu Fasiaitu. This intervention is commemorated by the Samoan proverb: faalava le Amoa (meaning 'intervention by Amoa'). The causus belli was the theft of Lu's sacred chickens by Tagaloa's people. The discovery of the sacred chickens is commemorated by the Samoan proverb, E ufiufi atu lava tama ' i moa ae Ίο Ίο mai, meaning the attempt to hide the chickens under the kava bowl was given away by their cry. Lu's sacred chickens meaning Sa Moa became the name of the islands (Krämer 1994:9; Turner 1884:10-15). Lu became the first Tui Atua. According to the Samoan Tui Atua and Tui Aana traditions, the Tagaloa inheritance was divided amongst the progeny of the union between Tui Atua Lu Fasiaitu and Amoa; this provided for the separate inheritances of Tui Atua, Tui Aana, Tui Manu' a, Tui Tonga and Tui Fiti. There is no Tui regime in the Hawaiian, Tahitian, Aotearoa or Rapanui traditions. The suggestion is that they migrated before the fall of the Tagaloa regime. In those traditions, there are several references to Savai'i (Hawaiki), Manono, Upolu, Tutuila, Manu' a, Tonga and Fiti and even To'elau and no mention of Samoa. This suggests that the name Samoa is more recent. Along the line of genealogical reasoning, Tui Atua, Tui Aana, Tui Manu'a, Tui Tonga, Tui Fiti are of equal ranking. Notably within this list there is not yet any specific reference to a Tui Samoa of equal ranking or of contemporaneous origin. When the missionaries arrived in Samoa in 1830, Samoa, as a distinct political entity included only Savai'i, Apolinia, Manono, Upolu and Tutuila - not Manu'a. In 1900, Manu'a, by colonial design, was joined to Tutuila (however, Manu'a only acceded after considerable colonial pressure in 1904). The joining has no basis in Samoan historical precedent. In sum, within the Tagaloa mythology, Man originates from the union between lagi (heaven) and papa (rock). Because of this genealogy, Man shares divinity with the sun, the moon, the stars, the sea and the land. The core symbols of the Tagaloa religion are celebrated linguistically in words like 'ele Jele (earth) and palapala (mud) which are also words for blood; and fatu meaning rock, which is also the word for heart. To underline the links across Polynesia, the placenta which is whenua in Maori, is also their word for land; fanua in Samoan is used in the same way to refer to both land and placenta. Also, the umbilical cord is similarly named, i.e. puke in Maori and pute in Samoan, these (both placenta and umbilical cord) are buried ritually in the earth. Rituals are a direct link to mythology, to Tagaloa (Andersen 1928). Mythology in Samoan rituals: Faalanu, Liutofaga and Fono ma Aitu Faalanu Mythology in Samoan rituals returns us to Pulemelei. Why did we need to do a purification or faalanu ritual? The answer is: because whenever tapu (sacred bond) is broken, you have to ask for pardon. Moreover, the respectful 6</page><page sequence="3">reference to the dead is tua 'a o loo tofafa i tia which is reference to "forbears who are sleeping in their graves". When you dig graves, you are disturbing the sleep of the dead and you have to ask pardon. I want to underline the point about asking pardon. The word for purification in Samoan is faalanu. Literally, it means cleansing by asking pardon (Pratt 1977). I was a member of a Samoan party which visited Whakatane in New Zealand in 2003 and was taken by our host Pouroto to an old Maori pa dating from the late twelfth century. On our way back, one of our party saw an avaava-a-aitu plant or in Maori kawakawa, and she said "I want to pluck some leaves". Another of our party said, "No you shouldn't. This is tapu ground and you have to ask Pouroto's permission." She then asked permission and so Pouroto launched into a chant which is faalanu before we could pluck leaves. You are breaking tapu in plucking leaves and therefore you have to ask for pardon. Furthermore, when you cut down a tree, the word in Samoan is oia. The word oia is derived from the word oi which means cry in pain presupposing that the tree suffers pain and a tree has a life and a soul (Pratt 1977). The core of Samoan spiritual life is the tapu relationship between Man and his environment. The greatest threat to Man's survival today is the threat to the ozone layer. Sometimes one wonders whether the solution of the ozone problem is recognition by Man of the tapu relationship between Man and trees, Man and rocks, Man and rivers, Man and the sea, Man and the elements. Thus, in Polynesian belief, before breaking tapu Man must reflect on the break to that spiritual bonding. Liutofaga The next question was, if we were to find human remains, what are we going to do with them? In other words, what are the appropriate processes and/or methods for dealing with the remains? We concluded that it would be the process for a secondary burial, in Samoan liutofaga. Liutofaga means changing the resting quarters (Pratt 1977). In Samoa, one of the essential ingredients for performing liutofaga would be sandalwood and sandalwood leaves. This is evidenced in the Samoan, word for funerals falelauasi, meaning the house that is lined with sandalwood leaves. Sandalwood, like incense, is one of the essences of Samoan culture, particularly Samoan spiritual culture. Fire is another core ingredient. The ritual making of fire is a direct inheritance from the Tagaloa mythology where Tiitiiatalaga brought fire from the underworld for the use of Man (Hovdhaugen 1987:52; Turner 1884:209-211). The purification ritual thus involved the ritualistic lighting of flares, bonfires and asi wood fires - all symbolic of the Tagaloa mythology. Fono ma Aitu The purification ritual had associated rituals. Putting together the purification ritual itself was as much a search as was the sequel (Stair 1896, 1898; Turner 1884; Krämer 1994). There were three sequel rituals: the fono ma aitu (conference with the spirits), lolo sa (making of holy oil) and sami lolo (making of containers for the oil). The asi or sandalwood leaves and wood which were presented at the purification ritual, were carefully stored for the sequel rituals. Here I will only account for the fono ma aitu (conference with spirits) ritual. The ritual, like most of the old religion religious rituals, is oriented to the sunset and sunrise. In the Tagaloa mythology, the Sun is not only a source of energy but also one of the principal progenitors of Man (Frazer et al. 1891). The hours of the day are measured by what is known in Samoan as inda the 'side of the sun' i.e. the line which divides the shade and the sunlight. The setting of the sun is welcomed by the crickets, so we say, the time when the crickets cry, tagi alisi. Midnight is when the alii o le pò, a sweet-smelling flowering plant, opens its petals and pervades the night air with a strong fragrant perfume. Morning is welcomed by the chickens, thus their honorific faailo ao, herald of the morning. Day and night are mythological husband and wife who, like life and death, are one and equal. The beginning of day, as is the beginning of night, invites spiritual contemplation. At twelve noon, the principal participants begin their fast. The principal participants, i.e. the four conferees who take up the four main posts in the house, the two matuatala and the two pepe, i.e. the two main posts on the side and the two main posts on the front and the back, break their fast at midnight. A little after six, just before sunset, the big wooden drum, lali or logo, tolls eight times symbolizing the eight tentacles of the octopus which is the earthly manifestation of divinity. This is the signal for the people inside the house to rub wood, si 'a, which is the ritual way of making fire (Figure 1). After making fire, sandalwood oil in burners were lit inside the house then the blinds, pola, were put down (save one at the back entrance). When sandalwood fires outside the house were lit, a flare was taken to the malae i.e. the open ground in front of the house, and bonfires were lit. This was the signal for the procession to begin. The procession was led by an orator dressed in tapa cloth and wearing a pandanus necklace. He held a long speaking staff and chanted the marriage chant which is a prayer that man's desires will marry God's intentions. He was followed by the four principal participants wearing head-dresses, necklaces or Jula and skirts made from sandalwood leaves. They in turn were followed by a support group which included the Tuaefu Methodist pastor. When they reached the house, each of the four principal participants was given a pierced green de-husked coconut. Each of the principal participants took up their designated posts inside the house. The support group dispersed except for those individuals assigned to ensure the fires kept burning throughout the night. At exactly midnight, the lali or logo tolls eight times again. This is the signal for the 'ghosts' to then proceed from the malae to the/a/e/house. Half of the 'ghosts' bodies are painted black. As they walk along, they mimic the cry and the manner of dogs, woodpigeons, the ve' a (the bird whose 7</page><page sequence="4">cry is supposed to be the signal for death) and owls. There is a belief that the "ghosts' incarnated themselves in these animals. When the two 'ghosts' reach the fale, they enter and drink the green coconuts after which they would then retire from whence they came. When the 'ghosts' withdraw, it is time to break the fast. Specially-prepared food known as sofesofe, which is sliced taro or yam sprinkled with coconut cream and covered with taro, banana and breadfruit leaves are tied with scraps of skin from thefau tree and baked in the umu (Samoan oven). As the sun begins to rise, emissaries are sent to the fale to find out whether the coconuts have been drunk. When it is found that they've been drunk, they return and report using the ritual call: Uà talia le Atua le fanoga (The gods have heeded our prayer). A procession heads for the fale. It is headed by an orator who is traditionally garbed and chanting marriage chants. The procession includes the Methodist pastor. The call for marriage acknowledges the marriage between the old religion and the new. On reaching the house, the procession enters single file through the opening at the back. The Methodist pastor then says a prayer. After the prayer, the blinds of the house go up. This is followed by a kava ceremony. After this is the distribution of sandalwood and sandalwood leaves (which are the essential ingredients in making holy oil), between the four separate households. A specially prepared breakfast marks the official end of the ritual. We had to search for the ritual because even though the fono ma aitu was the most common ritual of prayer seeking the gods' blessing for an undertaking in the old religion, the last time they were known to be performed was in the late 1890s. One of the principal participants, Joe Annandale, a director of O.F. Nelson Properties Board said: "The experience was awesome and one of the most spiritual in my life". For Polynesians, each of these rituals is directly informed by mythology. Juxtaposing mythology and science How can we place our respective knowledge about Pulemelei together to find common purpose in creating general understandings? And, how can we do this without questioning the integrity or legitimacy of one or the other? I am not sure. What I am sure of is, however, that I would like to begin to try. Allowing the excavation at Pulemelei was one step in that direction. Figure 1. Lighting the si' a during the ceremony at Pulemelei in 2003. Avia, Latu Ageli, Simi (bottom). (Photo Sebra Film, Bengt Jonson) 8</page><page sequence="5">Current readings of the Lapita evidence point to settlement of Fiji, Tonga and Samoa c. 3000 years ago. Similarly, settlements in the Marquesas are scientifically dated 300-600AD; Hawaii as 650-850AD; and New Zealand (Aotearoa) as 1000-1200AD. Clearly the origin of the Polynesian diaspora would have to be placed in Fiji, Tonga or Samoa and nomenclature suggests that Savai'i is the mythological Hawai'i, Havai'i or Hawaiki. In any case the dates make for interesting comparisons alongside the preliminary dates received thus far from the Pulemelei excavations. That is: 1. Between 150BC and 200 AD, settlement activities featuring earth ovens, Polynesian plainware pottery and stone tools have been found.. 2. Between 200-700AD no activities have been detected so far. 3. A re-activation phase with settlement activities in the form of earth ovens is seen during 700- 11 00 AD. 4. During 1 100- 1300 AD the Pulemelei mound was probably constructed and used. 5. 1400-1600AD there were other significant [human] activities in the area. 6. 1700-1800AD the Pulemelei site was abandoned and/or lost its importance. To me, such scientific evidence seems to echo the mythological history I cited earlier. The question remains thus: is it possible to connect mythological and archaeo- logical evidence? Or was Thor Heyerdahl mistaken? If he was not, the quest remains how we are to determine the connection. In searching for answers, I find that the Maoris of New Zealand/Polynesia are making, in my view, the most significant contribution to this quest. Their attempt to negotiate Maori lore alongside Western legal terms I find a wise start Justice Eddie Durie, (former head of the Waitangi Tribunal and current member of the NZ Law Commission) in his paper, "Will the settlers settle?" shows how all aspects of culture interrelate to comprise a coherent system. I believe that the Maori initiative will in time be accorded the highest accolades not only by thefanauga but by the world. Early 2003, I began building at Vaialua in Samoa a cultural research and restoration centre known as the Afeafe o Vaetoefaga (Figure 2). In September 2003, I visited Te Whare Wananga o Awanuiorangi, the Maori University at Whakatane (New Zealand). Here I was awarded an adjunct professorship. Awanuiorangi is the best-known Maori research and restoration centre in New Zealand and internationally. We, that is Awanuiorangi and Afeafe o Vaetoefaga, are committed to mutual cooperation for promoting common goals. One of these goals is to find ways to collectively share in this quest. Further understanding the juxtapositioning of mythology and science is, therefore, in our view part of that quest. Figure 2. Presentation of the Pulemelei project at the Afeafe o Vaetoefaga in 2004.

In searching for Tagaloa, I am searching for the legacy. When I said to Morris that we needed to consult about the purification rituals at Pulemelei, it literally meant we had to search and research into our spiritual culture. Christianity has effectively demonised the legacy of our Samoan ancestors to a point where their rituals, liturgies and beliefs have been rejected and spurned. Ironically, Christianity is today doing an about-face. In the latter part of the twentieth century, Christianity has acknowledged the deep spirituality of indigenous religious culture and is strenuously trying to find an accommodation. This seems reminiscent of the mythological attempt by the siblings to separate and after separation, to unify lagi (heaven) and papa (earth). The point is that the search for Tagaloa is the search for our human legacy. I believe that the findings from Pulemelei will provide useful information that will help address many questions about the connections between traditional mythology and contemporary society. Already the carbon-dating has opened avenues to new insights and perspectives. It also opens visions of soo (connection or connecting) between the Polynesian fanauga - from Hawaii to Tahiti to Rapanui. All, I hope, can gather one day at a connection festival at Pulemelei to celebrate common heritage. I want to end by reiterating the quote by Thor Heyerdahl (1998) used at the beginning of this talk. I reiterate it for in it, I believe, is the legacy of our collective futures. And both the wind and the people who continue to live close to Nature still have much to tell us which we cannot hear inside university halls. A scientist has to distinguish between legend and myth and make use of both. References Andersen, J. 1928. Myths and Legends of the Polynesians, London: Harrap. Cavalli-Sforza, L., P. Menozzi and A.
