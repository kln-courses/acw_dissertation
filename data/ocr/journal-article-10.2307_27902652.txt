<plain_text><page sequence="1">PEIRCE AND 'THE WILL TO BELIEVE" The multi-dimensionality of the term 'pragmatism' is by now a well Known phenomenon. Much has been made of the Peircean pragmatic theory of meaning vis-?-vis the Jamesian pragmatic theory of truth. Sometimes the contrast is made too quickly. This results in the undervaluing of important similarities between the two thinkers. It is often said that the Jamesian position appealed to the affective dimension in life, in the sense of our having the "right to believe" in a hypothesis when the situation is unsolvable, yet forced, living, and momen tous. Going further, James's metaphysics of "pure experience" involves more than just theoretical knowledge. He held the position that the human being is capable of experiencing dimensions of reality not completely reducible to the knowable, in the strong sense of that term. "Pure experience" is not an objec tive ground which can be demonstrated with certainty. In this sense, Jame sian metaphysics demands an element of "commitment." In this paper, I want to suggest that these same elements, the affective and/or the will to believe play an important role in Peirce's position. More specifically, as Peirce begins to refine his pragmatic method, he reacts against two things: nominalism and personalism. Both of these have one thing in common: they emphasize the "foreground" of experience. Peirce reacts by emphasizing the "background" of experience. Science is the study of the "useless"; pragmatism defines meaning in terms of conceivable effects "in the long run." The ongoing scientific community becomes the basic unit of reference, etc. However, the two elements of nominalism and personalism are not collapsible. In reacting to these two different degrees of individualism, Peirce sets the stage for the question: "What is the relationship between realism and meaning?" Differently put, Peirce moved from a narrow to a broad definition of pragmatism. So much is well known. But Peirce's broader definition, which is not metaphysically neutral, contains an element of con viction or commitment. The relationship between meaning and realism is ac tually that of the relationship between epistemology and metaphysics. How does this relation function for Peirce? In my opinion, the possibilities are two: if one tries to justify Peirce's metaphysics via his pragmatic epistemology, the latter must be widened still further, to include an affective dimension or preference. If one tries to justify Peirce's epistemology via his metaphysics, here, too, an element of commitment is involved, in so far as Peirce's entire</page><page sequence="2">PEIRCE AND THE "WILL TO BELIEVE" 343 cosmological outlook is not capable of verification. Let us see how this comes about. Peirce's pragmatism is developed within the doubt-inquiry-belief-action matrix made famous in the article "How to Make Our Ideas Clear." The Cartesian approach is rejected as insufficient. So is any claim to direct, in tuitive knowledge. For Peirce, if two beliefs alleviate the same doubt content by producing the same habit of action, then they are identical; here is pragmatism being born. ". . . what a thing means is simply the habits it in volves."1 However, in the well-known example of the meaning of calling something "hard," Peirce initially gives a very positivistic description of the situation. "There is absolutely no difference between a hard thing and a soft thing as long as they are not brought to the test." This stance, if consistently maintained, would commit Peirce to strict operational definitions and, furthermore, to nominalism. "Generals" would be viewed as abstractions; disposition terms could not be properly defined. Ultimately, laws in science would be seen as mere duplications of physical phenomena. As such they would be expendable on pragmatic grounds as superfluous.2 The scope of the difficulty becomes more obvious when one applies the pragmatic method to a term like "reality" and asks "What does it mean to say that V is real?" Peirce defined real things in terms of their effect, which was to cause belief.3 But he wanted to hold the position that ultimately some shared opinion would come about. Such a position is best stated in terms of the contrary-to-fact conditional, as indeed are the laws of science in general. Peirce, of course, realized all this and later on indicated that pragmatism was not to be taken in a neutral positivistic sense: . . . the question is, not what did happen, but whether it would have been well to engage in any line of conduct whose successful issue depended upon whether that diamond would resist an attempt to scratch it, or whether all other logical means of determining how it ought to be classed would lead to the conclusion which, to quote the very words of the article, would be "the belief which alone could be the result of the investigation carried sufficiently far."4 The above text is important because it clearly indicates Peirce's emphasis upon the subjunctive; pragmatism is not neutral; it is to be as sociated with a metaphysical stance of scholastic realism, which advocates the reality of generals; ". . . possibility is sometimes of a real kind."5 This broader view of pragmatism avoids the problems of operational definitions,6 but his new nonneutral metaphysical position raises the question of whether or not it can be justified by his epistemology.7 It is clear that Peirce did not want to merely conflate truth and reality, as in some form of idealism. But is is also clear that he rejected the position</page><page sequence="3">344 WILLIAM J. GAVIN wherein "the really real" is completely independent of all thought, forever and ever. For Peirce, such a view would "block the way of inquiry."8 Rather does Peirce define reality as independent of what you or I or any finite group of people might think about it, but not as necessarily independent of thought in general.9 Going further, Peirce asserts that the opinion ultimately fated to be agreed upon by the community of scientific investigators is what is meant by truth, and "the object represented in this opinion is the real."10 From this perspective then, individual beliefs are clearly "constrained"; also present or future opinions held in a communal fashion are subject to constraint?at this very moment. Only in the ultimate case limit where a completely shared opi nion is arrived at do we have co-extension of knowledge and reality. Such a position raises the question: "how do we get from here to there?" Peirce's reply is normative: we ought to get from here to there by employing the pragmatic method.11 But which version? Clearly the broader of the two definitions is needed. Only by employing a version of the method which allows for the reality of generals can Peirce say that, even now we are subject to constraint by a reality which exhibits independence in some sense. But can one employ the pragmatic method itself to establish that there is some conceivable difference between nominalism and realism? Can the epistemology be used to justify the metaphysical stance? Arthur Burks, in an insightful introduction to Peirce's thought, argues that it cannot. The sole difference between the nominalist's and the realist's conception of law has to do with potentialities; and there can be a genuine dispute between the two only if propositions involving potentialities alone have practical consequences. But clearly they do not. It can make no practical difference to say of a diamond that has not been and never will be tested whether it would or would not have been scratched if it had been tested. So long as we agree to the law "All diamonds are hard" and its practical consequence that "If this diamond is tested it will not be scratched," then it can make no practical difference what we hold of a dia mond that is never tested. An untested diamond is beyond practical interest. Another way of putting the matter is to say that action is based on actualities, not on potentialities, and that potentialities cannot affect conduct.12 In a footnote, Burks goes on to say that we do act on potentialities in the sense that "feelings of regret" are possible. For example, one might regret having made a particular speech, because had I not, I would have won the election. He (Burks) asserts, however, that such feelings of regret are not part of the conceivable effects of a belief. Such effects are "not consequences of the belief itself . . . but rather are consequences of holding the belief,"13 i.e., they are emotional associations of the belief. Now it is undoubtedly true that Peirce often argued in this fashion, viz., against the sentient, the private, the</page><page sequence="4">PEIRCE AND THE "WILL TO BELIEVE" 345 merely satisfying, etc., particularly when he was reacting to James's position, which he considered too individualistic and conduct-orientated. But there also seems to be at least one instance where Peirce cannot make this distinc tion clearly, namely, the belief by the members of a scientific community that they are slowly and correctly arriving at a shared belief. Peirce held that the members of a (the) scientific community were driven by a "cheerful hope"14 that their investigations would ultimately terminate in truth, if only they utilized the correct method, namely pragmatism. "We all hope that the dif ferent scientific inquiries in which we are severally engaged are going ultimately to lead to some definitely established conclusion we endeavor to anticipate in some measure."15 Pragmatism was seen as the required method?not because it was self-justifying in an apodictic sense, but because it was self-criticizing. The "proof of the method itself involves an applica tion of the method. And Peirce appealed to the "facticity" of the history of scientific achievement as inductive proof that the method worked. Further more, if pragmatism did not actually prove a realism once and for all, it was at least compatible with the thesis that "There are real things existing in dependently of us." The method of pragmatism, taken in the broader sense of implying the reality of generals, was supposed to avoid the possibility of a group of scientific investigations "fixing by convention" what the truth would be, because the method forced the individuals to be constrained by. ex perience, by independent reals. But the argument ultimately rests upon the cheerful hope that scientists will act in the manner described and prescribed by Peirce. There is nothing in the argument which would logically prohibit in vestigators deciding to hold some belief as paradigmatic in a Kuhnian sense. Indeed, it is at this level that Peirce's "Popperian" philosophy of science comes to the fore. Peirce believed that the "best hypothesis, in the sense of the one most recommending itself to the inquirer, is the one which can be the most readily refuted if it is false."16 Whereas confirmation makes a hypothesis more likely, which is to say more in alignment with our pre conceptions, Peirce did believe that hypotheses could be'falsified. Peirce has an implicit faith in scientific method as honest, a faith capable of inductive justification, but a faith, nevertheless. Karl Popper argues in the same fashion, admitting that at any given moment "we are prisoners caught in the framework of our theories; our expectations; our past experiences; our language. But we are prisoners in a Pickwickean sense: if we try we can break out of our framework at any time. Admittedly, we shall find ourselves again in a framework, but it will be a better and roomier one, and we can at any moment break out of it again."17 But as Kuhn has shown so well, if that were so, "there ought to be no very special difficulties about stepping into someone else's framework in order to evaluate it."18 Kuhn's conclusion is that Popper</page><page sequence="5">346 WILLIAM J. GAVIN "has characterized the entire scientific enterprise in terms that apply only to its occasional revolutionary parts",19 and, further, that when a transfer does take place between paradigms, it is a "conversion experience that cannot be forced".20 We need not take a position here on the Kuhn-Popper debate. The point is rather that Peirce himself made an act of faith in scientific method. While he believed that "the perversity of thought of whole generations may cause the postponement of the ultimate fixation"21 of belief, ultimately, he would not accept a Kuhnian analysis. On this he was adamant. Also, the issue here cannot be dealt with merely by pointing to the history of science. It is precisely what that history is that is at issue. We might sum the discussion up in a negative fashion by saying that Peirce's distinction between the four methods?tenacity, authority, a priori, and scientific22?is overdrawn. Peirce, himself, is tenacious in advocating the scientific method of pragmatism over all others, and he becomes more tenacious as James develops his own position. This does not mean that Peirce could not give good reasons for his position. His reasons were numerous, bril liant, and well-articulated. However, positively summarized, in the last analysis, Peirce's "cheerful hope" involves a Jamesian "will to believe" in a situation that is forced, living, and momentous. What is the situation? Ultimately, it concerns "the really real," the known and the knowable. Peirce was willing to admit that the really real is not coextensive with the known, but not that "the really real" was not knowable. To take such a stance would be, in his opinion, to "block the road to inquiry." James might respond that only such a stance (really real? greater than knowable) keeps our theoretical concepts honest. In a vague, un finished universe, one can avoid self-deception only if one admits the essential tentativeness of all hypotheses. This, on a meta-theoretical level, is a strategem, an attitude taken on James' part toward "the really real." Peirce assumes the opposite strategem, or attitude, though "pragmatically" they may come to the same thing.23 For him, it is "better" to assume the stance or hope that "the really real" is knowable?at least that this is possible. But this stance is a Peircean "will to believe." Furthermore, part of the meaning of adopting it is the consequences of holding it, on the part of the members of the scientific community. The "cheerful hope" cannot be expressed solely in terms of conceivable effects which would occur. Part of the "meaning" of the cheerful hope is its function as a catalyst. Otherwise an infinite regress is the result. What then has this to do with the possibility of justifying Peirce's metaphysics in terms of his epistemology? Simply this: if one tries to make the distinction between nominalism and realism simply in terms of con ceivable effects, i.e., meaning, such a distinction can be made if pragmatism</page><page sequence="6">PEIRCE AND THE "WILL TO BELIEVE" 347 is broadened still further, if the affective dimension is included, or better if, at least in some instances, the "consequences of belief vs. "consequences of holding that belief dichotomy is rejected. To do so flies in the teeth of Peirce's admitted emphasis upon the conceptual vis-a-vis the affective. But I am suggesting that at a meta-theoretical level, Peirce has no other choice. He chooses a different "belief than James, but his choice is made ultimately in the same way. In short, Peirce's pragmatic epistemology can make room for or justify his metaphysical realism only if it is admitted that an extra-logical dimension is involved. But this is only half the question. If Peirce's epistemology cannot justify his metaphysics without a "belief factor" can his metaphysics justify his epistemology? Here the issue is more obvious, and we can be briefer. However, the outcome is the same: an extra-logical dimension is involved. Metaphysically, Peirce developed an objective idealism, to account for his "realist" approach to laws in science. Mind is viewed as basic and as capable of associating, of taking on habits. ". . . ideas tend to spread con tinuously and to affect certain others which stand to them in a peculiar rela tion of affectability."24 The habits are the laws of nature. Matter from this perspective is viewed as frozen mind, as hidebound. Peirce viewed the uni verse as containing both a tychistic dimension and an anancastic aspect. But neither was a sufficient explanation of how things evolve. Peirce's evolutionary cosmology is "agapastic." The universe is moving from chance toward order, though at any given moment one can find aspects of both. Habits tend to spread and connect with others, in accordance with Peirce's principle of "synechism." Finally, the universe is viewed by Peirce as "... a vast representamen, a great sqmbol of God's purpose, working out its conclu sions in living realities."25 Such an outlook is remarkable for its richness and detail; yet it clearly involves an extra-logical dimension. Peirce himself viewed metaphysical outlooks as "guesses" based on current scientific facts. But his own exposition is clearly anthropomorphic. While Peirce, indeed, would have been the first to admit this,26 it does raise questions about the self sufficiency of a metaphysical position. But there is a bigger problem: Peirce asserted that his evolutionary outlook "constitutes a hypothesis capable of being tested by experiment."27 Yet it is highly questionable whether the thesis that we are moving from firstness through thirdness toward secondness in ac cordance with the principle of cosmic love constitutes a verifiable, or better, falsifiable proposition?or ever could do so. Peirce espoused a belief in God and advocated reverie as a "base" (i.e., the humble argument) which might be partially justified by the more logical neglected argument. But as he himself held, the base is "abductive," and there is no complete logic of abduction. Finally, Peirce's agapastic evolutionary position is vehemently opposed to the</page><page sequence="7">348 WILLIAM J. GAVIN "gospel of greed" and is, in his words, his "own passionate predilection .... Yet the strong feeling is in itself, I think, an argument of some weight in favor of the agapastic theory of evolution,?so far as it may be presumed to bespeak the normal judgment of the Sensible Heart."28 Such references to feeling and the sensible heart seem clearly to indicate that aspects at least of Peirce's metaphysical cosmology are value-laden. To be sure, Peirce's con tribution here is not a small one. But on this level also, an element of "convic tion" or "commitment" is involved. Conclusion The predominant approach to Peirce is to divorce his epistemology and his metaphysics, or at least his cosmology. The latter is "generally regarded by contemporary philosophers as the black sheep or white element of his philosophical progeny."29 By way of contrast, in his recent book Purpose and Thought: The Meaning of Pragmatism, John Smith has argued against any such dichotomy: ". . . The theory of science and of truth cannot, in Peirce's view, be elaborated without reference to a larger context embracing the nature of the real and its relation to the inquirer who seeks to grasp it in the form of truth."30 In this sense, for Smith, the very success of science must be viewed in a larger context, one of ontological dimensions. The achievements of "scientific inquiry are not left in their immediacy at the level of brute fact but must be understood as manifestations of patterns of development un derlying the evolution of the entire universe."31 The purpose of this paper was to indicate, in one way, why Smith's "wholistic" approach is more ade quate.32 Specifically, the distinction between Peirce's epistemology and his metaphysics is often made in terms of the logical vs. the psychological, the objective vs. the subjective. I have tried to show that it is a mistake to employ this distinction, because on both the level of epistemology and that of metaphysical cosmology a so-called "psychological" element, a belief factor, is involved. In reacting to nominalism and personalism?both foreground experiences?Peirce under-estimated important differences between the two. In arguing against nominalism and for realism, Peirce espouses a position wherein actual possibility exists. But in reacting against the personal, the af fective Peirce argues for the meaningful, and ultimately advocates a position wherein possibility can exist only as logical possibility?as possible pos sibility. This ultimately sets up the question of the relation of Peirce's theory of meaning to his theory of reality. In a sense, Peirce's theory of meaning evolves into a theory of truth, since it points toward a reality which is not completely "meaningful." In sum, whether one grounds Peirce's metaphysics</page><page sequence="8">PEIRCE AND THE "WILL TO BELIEVE" 349 in his epistemology or his epistemology in his metaphysics, a version of James's "will to believe" seems to be a necessary ingredient.
