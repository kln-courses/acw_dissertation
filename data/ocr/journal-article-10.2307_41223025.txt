<plain_text><page sequence="1">27 STELAE FROM TEIMA AND THE GOD SLM ( SALMU) Stephanie Dalley In 1877 Doughty found a stela at Teima in north-west Arabia which is now in the Louvre (Fig. 1) (1). It bore an inscription written in Aramaic, now well studied, which recorded the installation in Teima of a deity called SLM (Akkadian Salmu). belonging to a place HGM with the approval of the existing gods of Teima, of" which the first named was SLM of MHRM. The installation was carried out by the priest, not the king; and it was accompanied by an endowment of land: 16 palms from existing temple estates, and five palms from royal land. Thus it was not primarily a royal inscription. The priest who carried out and benefitted from the new foundation bore the Akkadian name SLMSZB (equivalent to the Akkadian Salmu-Šezib) and his patronymic was Egyptian. It was generally agreed that the god Salmu was probably in some way represented in the small, sculptured scenes on the narrow side of the stone. This consisted of an upper register showing the king in profile holding a staff and standing beneath a winged disk in a thoroughly Mesopotamian manner; and a lower register with the priest Çalmu-Zêzib standing before an altar on which a bull's head was placed. Three proposals seemed possible. First, Gadd proposed that the king's image was Salmu, for the noun salmu in Akkadian can mean "statue, image11 (2). He maintained that "a cult could therefore be paid to the images of great kings, probably after death, but here something more seems to be indicated. The T image* of a king, bearing symbols of divinity even while he worships greater gods, had become a god itself, receives offerings, and is taken as a name by the local priest". In fact the king bears no symbols of divinity, and there are, as shown below, serious objections to Gadd 's proposal. Second, Winnett and Reed proposed a different solution: to identify the winged disk as Salmu; and this is the proposal chiefly examined here, however unlikely it may appear at first sight (3). Third, Salmu could be represented by the bull's head. This bull's head was something of a mystery, but was generally held to represent an Arabian lunar cult by which the supposed monotheist Nabonidus had been enticed to spend some ten years of his rule in Teima, when he should have been in Babylon. It was thought to be related to the bull cult which was so widespread in Arabia in the late first millennium B.C. In recent years a stone pedestal with scenes sculptured on two sides has been retrieved from the earth at Teima in association with another Aramaic inscription which records an offering to Salmu of RB at Teima (Fig. 2). The sculptures are informative (4). The one portrays a standing Apis bull, recognisable by its crescentic horns enclosing a solar disk (although the uraeus, often found in front of the solar disk, is absent) and by the enfolding wings of Isis over its back. A priest</page><page sequence="2">28 holds an offering to its mouth. Above hovers a large winged disk which has specifically Egyptian features, namely legs extending down clutching stylized cartouches; and on a smaller scale a star and a crescent moon are just visible in the upper corners of the scene, typical of Syro-Mesopotamian, not Egyptian, iconography. On the sculptures which adorn the other side of the pedestal a large bull's head is set on a stepped altar, again characterised as an Apis bull by the crescent ic horns enclosing a solar disk; a priest holds an offering towards him. Two offering stands of different types are shown. Above are a winged disk, a star and a crescent moon, all shown on a similar scale. The bull's head on the altar makes it possible to give a better interpretation of the bull's head on the indistinct Louvre stela; in particular the crescent ic horns and the heavy dewlaps can now be recognised, although a solar disk between the horns is apparently absent. If we suppose that the god Salmu is represented on both the Louvre stela and the new Teima stone, Gadd's suggestion of the king's image is eliminated; and Winnett and Reed's suggestion that Salmu is the winged disk takes on a greater likelihood. It is also possible that Salmu is a name for the Apis bull, since it is represented on both stelae. The name of the god is unquestionably Semitic, not Egyptian or Persian. Although Gadd mentioned briefly the existence of a god in the Assyrian pantheon named Salmu, there is more evidence than he quoted; and one of the main purposes of this paper is to draw attention to an enigmatic deity in Mesopotamia from Akkadian sources, including a larger range of context than has been put forward before. The Akkadian word salmu as a common noun has several associated meanings which introduce an element of ambiguity into any attempt at precise identifications. It means "image, statue, representation"; it can include representations in miniature; and there is one group of information which shows that it can describe an object which represents a person but need not bear any physical resemblance to that person. It can also mean "constellation" in general. The word has a homonym salmu which is an adjective meaning "black, dark", but this causes less confusion than one might expect, for the two words are often conveyed by their respective Sumer ian logograms, which make a clear distinction between the two homonyms: ALAM and NU as salmu "statue", and GE, as salmu "black" (5). о The Akkadian god Çalmu first occurs in the Old Babylonian god list known as AN=Anum, which is known mainly from mid to late 2nd millennium tablets (6). In this god list Çalmu ( ALAM) the god is given as a name or synchretism of the sun-god Shamash. The god Çalmu also comes in Late Assyrian god lists of the 8th-7th centuries B.C. which group the deities to be found in various temples (7). Çalmu is clearly distinguished from the statues of specific kings which stand in temples, and from statues of specific gods. And it is very likely that Salmu is an abbreviation for Çalmu-sarri, a god name which occurs in the so-called Address book of the Gods when Çalmu is not present (8). This is actually a crucial point in the coming argument: whether or not Salmu is an abbreviation of Salmu-Šarri (or the latter is an extension of the former); or whether the two are to be considered as separate deities. There is one personal name of the Neo-Assyrian period in which Salmu-larri does appear to be a variant of Çalmu, but no definite evidence has yet been found to make it a certainty (9). The god Salmu is also found in a Middle Babylonian text from the Hittite capital Hattusas (10). Salmu is not found as a divine component of personal names until the mid-second millennium, when it occurs occasionally in names from Nuzi and Babylonia; and when it does, the analysis of the name can in some cases be ambiguous, owing to confusion with the common noun salmu. Perhaps the most significant occurrence is in the name of the Midianite king Salmunna, from the book of Judges, around 1100 B.C. In the late Assyrian period Salmu is a relatively common element, but becomes very rare again after the fall of Nineveh in 612 B.C., apart from the early Arabian names found carved on rocks in the vicinity of Teima and Dedan. So the overall impression is of a god who enters Mesopotamia only in the first half of the second millennium, presumably as</page><page sequence="3">29 a Semitic but foreign deity , whose origins may tentatively be suggested in NW Arabia. If this is correct, the towns MHRM, RB and HGM should also be sought in that region: presumably they are the main, historical centres of Salmu' s cult. We have already mentioned that Salmu-sarri may be a lengthened form of the god name Salmu. This god Salmu-sarri, translatable as "Salmu of the king", is mentioned in three late Assyrian legal documents (two from Tell Halaf (11), biblical Gozan, and one from Nimrud (12)) as a divine witness beside Shamash. Such a feature occurs in Old Babylonian contracts where the gods may stand as witnesses as an alternative to a specific clause in which oaths are sworn by those gods as a promise to keep the agreement recorded in the contract (13). By collecting together and comparing such clauses for the neo-Assyrian and neo-Babylonian period, we can show that Salmu-sarri can be expressed alternatively with the clause "the oaths of the king" or "oaths by majesty". A recent article has shown that those phrases were abbreviated and deified in very late Babylonian texts as a god adêsu (14). During the Old Assyrian and Old Babylonian periods - i.e. the early second millennium - oaths were sworn by participants in legal contracts who grasped a symbol of a deity, much as one puts a hand on the Bible while swearing to tell the truth in an English court of law. The symbols consisted, for instance, of a god's weapon or emblem. Shamash the sun-god and lord of justice could be represented by his saw or by his sun-disk, and there are texts to show that such items were hired out of temples for the swearing of oaths (15). After the Old Babylonian period there is very little comparable material, but it seems certain from a few references that the tradition continued. The weapons or emblems which were thus used were deified, in other words they were written often with the divine determinative; and they are occasionally found as a divine name compounded in personal names and in godlists in various periods including the neo-Assyrian. Thus there is a possibility that Salmu, originally an aspect of Shamash the god of justice, became used as the symbol of the king when people swore oaths by royal majesty. It is well-known and undisputed that the winged disk as a symbol originated in Egypt. Gardiner described the early winged disk, before it spread to Western Asia, during the second millennium, as "a fusion of the sun-god Rë ' , of the falcon Horus, and last but not least, of the reigning king whose name fills the universe and whose protection extends over both North and South" (16). He maintained that "from the very beginning the Winged Disk represented the king's actual person", but that "this does not, however, prevent the Winged Disk sometimes being thought of as distinct from the king and confer ing blessings on him". It is also generally accepted that, when the winged disk is found from the mid-second millennium onwards in Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia it is a solar symbol that is particularly closely associated with the ruling monarch, even though the king (unlike the pharaoh) was not, in most instances, divine. At the same time, however, there was both in Mesopotamia and among the Hittites a circular, wingless sun-symbol which was not particularly associated with the king; it was purely the symbol of the sungod (17). The Akkadian words for this item of iconography are known (18). The Akkadian word for the winged disk has not yet been identified. Undisputed is the fact that, after the early second millennium no Mesopotamian kings, whether Babylonian or Assyrian, claimed that they were divine, whether during their lifetime or after their death. They never wore the horned crown, not took the divine determinative in front of their name, nor were shrines to them ever set up. There is one anomaly in this: it was common in cuneiform Akkadian at Amarna, Ugarit and Hattusas in the second half of the second millennium for the king to be addressed as samsiya "my sun", and the word was often written as the sungod' s name complete with the divine determinative. As Calmeyer has pointed out, the royal epithet "sun" should be connected with the fact of the winged disk as a solar symbol intimately connected with the king (19).</page><page sequence="4">30 Differences of opinion concerning the identity of the winged disk arise during the first millennium, where it is found on Assyrian, Babylonian, Urartian and Achaemenid works of art. At this juncture new elements enter the scene: the winged disk is found not only in its simple form, but sometimes contains a human figure wearing the crown of divinity, either emerging waist upwards from the winged disk (Assyria and Iran) or a complete figure encircled by the disk (Urartu). In Assyria the winged disk with the human figure is occasionally accompanied by two human heads each perched on a wing, looking in towards the central figure (20). In neo-Assyrian times the figure in the winged disk often wears the horned crown of a deity, usually occurs above the king or above a "tree-of-life", and often mirrors the actions of the king, or holds the "rod and ring", identified as the rein of kingship. Two main identifications have been proposed: that of Shamash, and that of Ashur. The former has the advantage that the winged disk without a human figure is a sun symbol from Egypt; but it involves the difficulty that on neo-Assyrian monuments there is an alternative symbol, the wingless sundisk, representing Shamash. We would take this to imply that the two symbols stand for distinctly different attributes. The latter identification as Ashur simply has no particular supporting evidence, and this is now accepted by almost everyone (Ashur f s symbol being the horned crown). During the Achaemenid period the human winged disk is found on large-scale sculpture above representations of the king. It wears the royal crown, not the horned helmet of divinity, except in the earliest example, that from Behistun. On seals the human winged disk appears to be closely related to an encircled human bust. Recent studies have tended to reject the old identification of the Achaemenid winged disk as Ahuramazda, and have opted for it as a symbol of royalty. This automatically implies a considerable break from Mesopotamian tradition if the old identifications of neo-Assyrian examples (whether with Shamash or Ashur) are retained. Such a break in tradition would fly in the face of continuity in a great variety of practices through the neo-Assyrian, neo-Babylonian and Achaemenid periods. In any case, for this period a straightforward identification with Shamash is abandoned by all scholars . If one held the opinion that one symbol could stand for completely different things in Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, Urartu, Iran, Assyria and Babylonia in the first half of the first millennium, such lack of continuity would present no problem. But if one believes that borrowings and synchretisms account for the appearance of one symbol among several different nations, the present varied identifications of the winged disk are indeed problematic. The identifications with Shamash or Ashur or Ahuramazda do not take into account the remarkable variations described which indicate that the winged disk could be associated with not just one, but also two or three anthropomorphic figures, both in the neo-Assyrian and in the Achaemenid period. An explanation for such multiplicity has been suggested by Calmeyer in the context of Achaemenid tomb reliefs, where more than one winged disk is shown (21). He suggests that the living king, the crown prince and a previous king (either the immediate predecessor or the founder of the dynasty) may all be represented separately by winged disks. It seems clear that there was a shift in the meaning of the winged disk during the early first millennium. The Teima stelae do not give conclusive proof that the winged disk was the same as Salmu, for one could maintain that the god Salmu is simply not represented on the sculptures. But the following hypothesis acts upon the assumption that it is so, and attempts to reconcile the evidence with some of the suggestions that we have just described, particularly since there is no evidence to connect the god Salmu with bulls. Salmu is a form of the sungod represented by the winged disk. Its origins may be in Midian or in Egypt, with perhaps an early synchretism between the Semitic god and the Egyptian symbol. It came to Western Asia where it became closely associated with the king as the Shamash and lawgiver of the people over a wide area including Syria,</page><page sequence="5">31 Hittite Anatolia and Iraq. As a symbol it was used for touching when oaths of loyalty were sworn to the king. On the seals of his servants it reminded them constantly of their oath of loyalty. On monumental stone reliefs it accompanied the symbols of other great gods, standing for Shamash and his protege the king. When two heads were shown on the wings, or when the disk hovered over two royal figures at the tree-of-life, it symbolised divine protection for the king and his appointed heir, just as oaths to the king on some legal texts were sworn both by the king and the crown prince. Then in the Achaemenid period the winged disk came to stand entirely for the dynastic principle, a powerful symbol of loyalty and cohesion. By then it would have moved quite far from its original concept as a second millennium solar deity of Midian, where indeed the name of the god need not have had precisely the same meaning as it had in Akkadian. An extension to this hypothesis has implications for many Mesopotamian works of art. Both the winged disk and the other symbols of the great gods are mainly present on monuments to remind onlookers of their oaths of vassaldom. Above all, they appear on stelae that were set up in newly conquered cities, or on rock reliefs in areas dominated by Assyria, or on the seals of royal officers. They are always present when captives are shown submitting to the king; but they are never there when the king greets an equal (of which the best example is the thronebase of Shalmaneser III). If this interpretation is correct, the connexion of the winged disk with the Apis bull on the Teima stone can be explained as a fusion of Egyptian and Asian elements to promote loyalty to the dynasty in power; thus it would have been a kind of forerunner of the cult of Serapis in Ptolemaic times. Representations of the Apis bull are not restricted to Teima. So far I have found two on rock carvings published from Jubba in the Southern Nafud (Fig. 3), which apparently are thought to be many centuries earlier than the Teima stelae, although a precise date is still far from certain (22). Finally I would like to mention that Salmu on the Teima stela cannot be proved to have any lunar connexions. If Nabonidus, the Babylonian king who went to Teima for 10 years of his reign, was a monotheist (which I myself do not believe) it was not because of Salmu as a lunar deity: the evidence of the godlist AN=Anum shows that Salmu was a solar deity. If Teima was indeed a centre for moon worship, then one of the other gods of Teima, whose names are inscribed on the stelae, must be a lunar deity. Since the moon in Egyptian was often called the bull of heaven, and since the Apis period is a lunar cycle, the bull on the Teima stelae, not Salmu, is a possible candidate as a lunar deity. ******************** NOTES Many thanks are due to Dr Helen Whitehouse of the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, for her help with identifying and discussing the Apis bull.
