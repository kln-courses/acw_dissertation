<plain_text><page sequence="1">Foraging decisions by plants I read the article 'Foraging decisions by plants - Making a case for plant ethology' by Ganeshaiah and Uma Shaanker (Current Science, 1993, 65, 371) highlighting the discovery of plants exhibiting choice over food patches. Not only Darwin and Kalidas seem to have realized the ability of plants to exhibit movements, ordinary farmers also seem to have known for a long time about the ability of roots to grow towards fertilizer. About 45 years ago while a primary school student, I had noticed roots of tapioca cultivated on poorly fertilized soil growing towards a cow dung heap at a distance of almost one meter away. Based on this observation 1 cultivated a small plot of land with tapioca planted in rows about 5 feet apart in which fertilizer was introduced - after about eight weeks of planting stem cuttings - in furrows in the centre of the row, i.e. approximately 21/2 feet away from the plant. At harvest the tapioca tubers from experimental plots were found to be average of approximately 2 feet long grown towards the fertilizer compared to an average of approximately only one foot long for tapioca tubers grown in the conventional manner. 1 was told that tapioca from the experimental plot had the highest yield per unit area ever produced in that farm. Now that an Oxford don has discovered the ability of plants to forage for food, I wonder if it is possible to exploit this finding for the benefit of the farmer. P. J. Thomas Dariyalal Housing Society Bungalow 29 Juhu Tara Road Bombay 400 048, India I have not read in a long time an 'opinion' article which is as intere sting, thought-provoking and persuasive as the one by Ganeshaiah and Uma Shaanker in Current Science (1993, 65, 371). The authors have marshalled their arguments on the basis of earlier literature and explain that plants exhibit rivalry, mate choice.,, aggression and conflicts. This range of behaviour is richer than those of some aquatic, sessile animals. As a student of ethology myself, I do not see why Ganeshaiah or Uma Shaanker should be tentative, diffident or defensive in speaking of plant behaviour. 1 have myself made a list of 64 species of plants that show 'sleep' movements of leaves, petals, etc. growing in the Madurai Kamaraj University campus, a copy of which 1 have sent to K. N. Ganeshaiah. Interestingly, the hesitation to admit that plants do behave much as animals is more prevalent among botanists than among zoologists.

In Uma Shaanker are welcome to the field word biologists used when it was comparison, the biologists of today of ethology - a house of lost causes - erroneously believed that humans were (especially of the botany-zoology and add to its variety and richness, very different from animals; therefore varieties) appear to be an insecure and one used different terminologies when demoralized lot. These authors are only speaking of mice and men.
