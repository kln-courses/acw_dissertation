The author has won his spurs in the field of targumic literature, judged by his many publications on the subject (cf. the bibliography pp. 428 ff.). This (first) volume is a new prove of his extensive learning and constitutes a real treasure house besides such works as those written by Diez Macho, Le Deaut, McNamara and others. As stated by the author in the Preface to the present volume (pp. 9 ff.), the significance of the targums rests on the fact that they reflect an early system of biblical exegesis. On the one hand, these writings inform us about the way in which the Sages understood the OT, on the other hand they help us to understand the plain meaning of the Bible. There does not, however, exist such a thing as an uniform system in the various targums. This book makes an effort to understand the nature of the targums, their formation and the history of their development, and to sketch the outlines that unite them. The numerous quotations from the targums to be found in Komlosh's book serve as a guide to the understanding of the targums and the methods used in writing them (a full list of quotations on pp. 440-481!). In explaining the various parts of the targums the author tries to describe the targumists' state of mind and to perceive the basic reason why they deviate from the text of Scripture. The targumists' work cannot be characterized as routinism: it was a creation, a work of inspiration. The author initially aimed at presenting in one volume an examination of all the existing targums, but later on felt compelled to reduce the limits of the present volume due to the abundant material to be dealt with. In consequence, a study of the targums to the biblical writings coming after Ezekiel and of the Palestinian targums can be expected in a second volume. The present publication includes an Introduction (pp. 13-99), an examina tion of Targum Onkelos (pp. 103-267), of the targums to Joshua (pp. 13-99), to the book of Judges (pp. 280-297), the books of Samuel (pp. 298-329), the books of Kings (pp. 330-348), the book of Isaiah (pp. 351-396 and the book of of Jeremiah (pp. 397-417). A list of abbreviations, a selected bibliography, a list of Bible-, targumim- and other quotations, and an index of authors and subjects (pp. 421-504) concludes the volume and enhances its value. The Introduction offers a detailed and well informed discussion on such topics as the Aramaic language, the Sages' attitude toward the Aramaic translations, the relationship between Onqelos and Aquila, the language, origin and date of Targum Onkelos, the relationship between the latter and the Palestinian targums, the masorah, vocalization and the editions of Targum Onkelos. The Introduction also contains good surveys of the value of Targum Onkelos and of the exegetical methods used in it, descriptions of the other Palestinian targums, the Geniza fragments and Neofiti 1, the Targum to the Prophets and the (fragments of the) Palestinian targum to the Prophets. There is a detailed description of the targums to all the books of the Hagio grapha in as far as an Aramaic translation of the latter exists—a most useful addition to the corresponding sections in the introductions written by Diez Macho and Le Deaut. The section dealing with Targum Onkelos i.a. discusses the following subjects: the anti-anthropomorphism of this targum (pp. 103-119); the</page><page sequence="3">REVIEW OF books 80 etymologies of the targum text; halakah and haggadah; its evaluation and defence of the Patriarchs' behaviour; geographic names; picturesque phrases and expressions; its avoidance of abstract conceptions and rhetorical questions; its exegetical additions; Greek words in the targum; the differen ces between the said targum and the Palestinian targums and the Ten Commandments in the Palestinian targums. Some of these topics can equally be found in the discussions on the individual books of the Bible, where they are supplemented by remarks on subjects relating to the contents of the book under consideration. The author's knowledge of the Hungarian language enabled him to consult important monographs written in this language, which are only partially listed in Grossfeld's Bibliography of Targum Literature. For those who are not acquainted with modern Hebrew we might recommend a translation of this useful work in one of the modern languages). μ. J. Mulder</page></plain_text>
